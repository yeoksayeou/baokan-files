(Yichang) The Japanese troops in the Luohan Temple area on the east bank of the Han River bombarded Shayang, the Chinese side, with heavy artillery all day on the 2nd, and fired a large number of sneeze-inducing gas bombs at the Chinese side. The Chinese army calmly fought back and always held their original positions. Before dawn on the 3rd, the Chinese army in Shayang rose up with a roar and crossed the river in two routes to launch an attack. The Japanese troops on the east bank were panic-stricken and collapsed without resistance. The Chinese army first occupied the two important strongholds of Luohan Temple and Duobao Bay, and took the opportunity to pursue the Japanese troops in Jianhua in three routes towards Tuochuan Pier, Yonglong River, and Yangjia Position. At the same time, the Chinese army also crossed the river from ports such as Sigang City and Cunliudu with powerful troops to attack the Japanese army, and has cleared the Japanese troops in front of them, advancing towards Yuqi River.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Chongqing Madly: Many Bombs Dropped in Downtown Areas, Fires Started, Casualties Unknown; Chinese Fighter Planes Take Off to Intercept, Shooting Down Seven Japanese Bombers

(Chongqing) At 11:20 AM on the 3rd, the local air defense headquarters reported from Yuanling that many Japanese planes were flying from east to west. At around 12:30 PM, another report was received from Youyang that two groups of Japanese planes were flying north. An air raid alarm was issued at 12:45 PM, and Chinese planes also took off to intercept. An emergency alarm was issued at 12:55 PM. Japanese planes invaded the city airspace at 1:17 PM in the afternoon. Their bombing targets seemed to be certain military organs, but the military organs had long been evacuated to the countryside. The Japanese pilots' skills were extremely poor, causing nearby shops and residences to be bombed. In addition to dropping heavy bombs, they also dropped a large number of incendiary bombs. Xisi Street, Zuoying Street, and other places immediately caught fire and burned for a long time. At this time, the Chinese defense corps, police, and various rescue organizations all rushed out to rescue amidst the explosions. They worked hard with great spirit and extreme indignation. Their tragic and indignant emotions and sense of responsibility were fully demonstrated. The general public was also very calm, obeyed order, and did not panic, which shows that the people have the greatest determination. The number of deaths and injuries, as well as public and private losses, are being actively excavated and investigated. At the same time, the air defense department and the joint office for emergency relief from air raids are jointly handling the aftermath. The Japanese planes were fiercely attacked by Chinese planes and fled in panic at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. It is reported that one plane was shot down by Chinese planes and is now being searched for in nearby areas. Also, today the Japanese planes dropped hundreds of packs of "New Youpai" cigarettes wrapped in red paper, some of which contained poisonous gas and are currently being tested. (3rd dispatch)

(Chongqing) Since January 15th of this year, Chongqing had not been subjected to air raids for a long time. At 1:15 PM this afternoon, 27 Japanese planes suddenly flew over Chongqing. Many Chinese fighter planes immediately took off to intercept, shooting down one Japanese bomber. However, several Japanese planes dropped incendiary bombs and many bombs, causing smoke and flames to rise. Losses are unknown. (2nd Associated Press dispatch)

(Chongqing) The most densely populated area of Chongqing was heavily bombed by Japanese planes just after noon today. It is believed that there must be a large number of casualties. Japanese bombers dropped many bombs on the bustling streets on the north bank of the Yangtze River, causing a major fire. The office of the French-Chinese Joint Navigation Company was hit, and the building was bombed to the ground. One car parked in the garage was destroyed, and four Chinese people were buried in the rubble. Only two people have been dug out so far. The situation a hundred yards away is extremely tragic, as dozens of wooden houses caught fire from incendiary bombs and spread rapidly. The Dagong Newspaper office was also burned down. Many people were gathered at the riverside pier, boarding boats to cross to the south bank. The bombs fell before the boats could cast off, killing at least seventy people. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

### Fierce Air Battle, Japanese Planes Shot Down

(Chongqing) Today, 22 Japanese planes attacked Chongqing, dropping dozens of incendiary bombs and light explosive bombs, causing fires in seven places at the same time. Thick smoke covered the sky, rising to a hundred feet. According to initial statistics, this attack resulted in 1,000 casualties, including 100 deaths. Considering the entire population of Chongqing, 1,000 casualties cannot be considered many, which shows the effectiveness of the city's air raid shelters. The city's firefighters bravely fought the fires and were very effective. Although lookouts reported that 45 Japanese bombers were approaching, only 22 planes actually reached Chongqing. This Japanese air raid was planned, as the planes flew over Chongqing twice, dropping bombs on densely populated cities. The Japanese planes dropped all their bombs in two minutes, without bombing the areas where the government is located. At the same time, they used machine guns to strafe the crowds. The residence of Mr. Troessel, the German manager of the American-owned Bowerton White Lister Company, was bombed and collapsed, and Mr. Troessel was seriously injured. The China-France Navigation Company was also hit. Two bombs also fell near the YMCA, but fortunately did not explode. One fell outside the YMCA entrance, and the other fell in the square. A bomb fell twenty yards away from the Canadian Friends Society. When another bomb exploded, fragments affected the square of the Canadian Women's Association dormitory and a certain hotel. Miss Peters and Miss Gomelly both reside there. According to this air raid, only 22 Japanese planes reached Chongqing, because Chinese fighter planes, after receiving the alarm, immediately flew into the air to intercept, so many Japanese planes were repelled at that time and failed to reach their destination. When the Japanese planes flew to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, they were intercepted by Chinese planes, and a fierce battle broke out between the two sides. According to Chinese statistics, at least three Japanese planes were shot down in Chongqing. At the same time, Associated Press reporters saw three Japanese pilots descend by parachute. He first saw one person descend, and then saw two people descend together in one parachute, all falling into the Chinese airfield. However, according to foreign observers, only one Japanese plane was shot down, while two Chinese planes were shot down. Also, according to the most reliable sources, the exact number of dead and wounded is over one thousand, because one bomb hit a refugee shelter. It is not yet known whether all the refugees in the refugee shelter were killed or injured, but it is believed that at least fifty people were killed. Also, four Chongqing newspapers suffered heavy losses, namely Dagong Newspaper, Xinhua Daily, Southwest Daily, and New Sichuan Newspaper. Among them, Southwest Daily and New Sichuan Newspaper suffered heavier losses and may not be able to continue publishing immediately. Another bomb fell on the air defense headquarters, causing a large amount of gasoline and oil stored in the warehouse to catch fire. The fire was very fierce. Anti-aircraft guns fired continuously, and many shell fragments fell. It is reported that a sampan in the Yangtze River was hit by a bomb. This afternoon, the fire was brought under control, and hundreds of workers and firefighters were demolishing the houses near the fire to prevent the fire from spreading. The Japanese planes came at 1:00 PM, and after dropping their bombs, they planned to fly away. However, when they attacked the Chinese military airfield, they were intercepted by Chinese planes, and an air battle broke out. The streets were littered with debris, and black smoke filled the sky. After the main power lines in the commercial district were destroyed, the lights and telephones were cut off. After the air raid ended, people fled to both banks of the Yangtze River, rushing into Central Park for temporary shelter, carrying their belongings. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)

A certain place. Forty-five Japanese Type 96 twin-engine bombers, formed into five teams, deployed in a square formation, invaded Chongqing's airspace from west to east at about 1:40 PM, dropping bombs. The Chinese air force took off before the Japanese planes attacked, preparing to intercept. When the Japanese planes were dropping their bombs, Chinese planes caught up head-on. The Chinese vanguard team launched a fierce attack on the Japanese vanguard team, and the Chinese follow-up teams attacked the Japanese plane teams in front of them. Machine guns fired everywhere. The Chinese planes, with their accumulated strength, bravely advanced into the Japanese plane formation amidst enemy fire, launching continuous and close attacks. The Japanese plane formation became loose. Chinese planes either encircled and attacked one Japanese plane with several planes, or attacked one Japanese plane with one plane until it was shot down. During the pursuit, all Chinese planes reached their maximum fuel range or ran out of ammunition. The surviving Japanese planes fled east in a panic, and gradually gathered near Shizhu before fleeing east. As a result of this battle, three Japanese planes were hit by Chinese planes and caught fire in the air, falling into the valley east of Guangyang Dam. Also, when a certain team leader was attacking, he saw four Japanese planes descending with heavy smoke, crashing in the area east of Chongqing. According to another team member's eyewitness account, he saw 38 Japanese planes flying east. A total of seven Japanese planes were lost. Further, according to intelligence from Shizhu, Japanese planes east of Shizhu were hit in the fuel tanks and crashed. This is being investigated. Two Chinese planes parachuted, and one parachute landed near the police academy. This battle was quite fierce and rare in recent air battles. Most of the bombs dropped by Japanese planes landed in the Yangtze River and Jialing River, and a small number landed in urban areas, all in residential areas. The Japanese, at the end of their rope and struggling desperately, did not hesitate to be inhumane, indiscriminately bombing unarmed Chinese citizens. We will not only impose sanctions based on world opinion, but we will definitely use our strength to curb the brutality of the Japanese army and avenge our dead compatriots. (3rd dispatch)

### The So-Called "Huaxing Bank"

The "Huaxing Bank," jointly established by the puppet organizations in central China at the instigation of Japan and various Japanese banks, was announced yesterday in Shanghai and is rumored to be about to issue counterfeit currency in order to seize Chinese legal tender circulating in areas currently occupied by the Japanese army. In order to undermine Chinese wartime finance and realize its so-called "yen bloc," Japan last year issued counterfeit "United Reserve Bank" banknotes under the name of the so-called "United Reserve Bank." The value of these counterfeit banknotes is now falling sharply. According to a recent Reuters dispatch, the premium for swapping counterfeit banknotes for Chinese legal tender in North China has reached 34.5%. By analogy, it is not difficult to foresee the future of the so-called "Huaxing Bank."

It is very difficult to establish a country's monetary system, but it is not easy to destroy it. With the solid foundation of the Chinese legal tender system and the loyalty of the people to their country, any financial conspiracy by Japan will not achieve unexpected gains. This has been proven by the failure of counterfeit banknotes in North China. Moreover, Japan's attempt to undermine the Chinese legal tender system is only an attempt, and in reality, it does not have the ability. The failure of counterfeit banknotes in North China was due to having the name but not the substance, making it impossible to obtain foreign exchange. The counterfeit banknotes about to be issued in central China will of course also have no so-called reserve. Some may think that the yen will be used as a reserve, but the amount of banknotes issued in Japan at the end of last year had expanded to 2.9 billion yen. Most of the banknote reserves have been used to purchase military supplies. If the counterfeit banknotes in central China are backed by the yen, it will indirectly accelerate the inflation of Japanese banknotes. Some may think that foreign currency will be used as a reserve, but in the current anti-aggression movement of various democratic countries, who would be willing to bear the responsibility of helping aggression? Japan's credit in the international community, not to mention that there is no guaranteed loan to support counterfeit Chinese banknotes, will not be secured. Even the so-called industrial construction loans, under Japan's current policy of excluding European and American interests in China, have already closed the door to borrowing. It is reported that last year, the puppet Manchurian government borrowed 10 million US dollars from the United States for railway equipment, but it was rejected by the United States. Some may think that counterfeit banknotes will be exchanged for legal tender, and the reserve of legal tender will be used as a reserve. Although this is Japan's hope, the reality is extremely slim, because the Chinese government has long imposed extremely strict controls on foreign exchange. Some may think that the foreign exchange from the export of goods can be used as a reserve. Although this is possible, how can hoping for plums quench thirst? What is the real reserve except for the Japanese soldiers' pistols and bayonets?

In fact, Japan has always known that the current counterfeit banknotes in North China cannot destroy China's legal tender system. The counterfeit banknotes in central China in the future will be the same as the counterfeit banknotes in North China, and will absolutely not have the ability to compete with Chinese legal tender. However, Japan, at a time when the people are impoverished and resources are exhausted, cannot but take this method of issuing counterfeit banknotes in order to妄想to achieve the illusion of creating a "new order in East Asia." Therefore, Japan instigates puppet organizations to gradually expand the scope of counterfeit banknote issuance, not to establish the foundation of a monetary system for puppet organizations. The issuance of counterfeit banknotes, in relation to puppet organizations, is at most a loan of economic blood debts in military occupation areas when Japan is economically unable to assist. Japan's real purpose is to take advantage of the convenience of the yen bloc to exploit the people in the guerrilla areas of China as much as possible as a temporary support for the war against China, and to use counterfeit banknotes as a basis to control foreign exchange and vigorously exclude all European and American power in China.

The only role that counterfeit banknotes currently have in the guerrilla areas of China is to facilitate trade with Japan: that is, to use counterfeit banknotes to forcibly buy goods in the guerrilla areas of China, transfer them for export, and obtain foreign exchange, which is then controlled. Exporting merchants must sell foreign exchange to puppet banks, and importing merchants must obtain foreign exchange supply in advance. This is the way it is done in North China. For example, last year Japan's trade with North China, both imports and exports, doubled from the previous year. At the same time, it can also use Chinese commodities that Japan does not need to exchange for various raw materials needed for Japanese military affairs. For example, the so-called import commodity list with priority rights formulated by the puppet "United Reserve Bank" in North China completely supplies foreign exchange for the supplies of the Japanese army first. On the contrary, the trade of European and American countries with North China, whether it is imports or exports, is either restricted by Japan or has no profit, so the trade volume has been greatly reduced. Now, in order to obtain more raw materials and a larger market, and in order to more actively exclude the rights and interests of European and American countries in China, Japan naturally wants to expand the scope of counterfeit banknote issuance to the central China region.

The Chinese government had already taken precautions against Japan's attempt, such as prohibiting the free flow of goods between the mainland and the guerrilla areas, improving and reorganizing the local finances of the war zone, and the guerrillas' strict punishment of those who use counterfeit banknotes. These are all effective ways to deal with Japan's issuance of counterfeit banknotes. Therefore, Japan's attempt to issue counterfeit banknotes in central China will have a limited ability to damage Chinese legal tender. In terms of the current actual situation, the circulation of counterfeit banknotes in central China in the future will not be outside of several larger cities directly controlled by Japanese military force. The people living in these areas and the European and American overseas merchants who operate foreign trade in central China will be greatly affected. The latter will likely encounter the same environment as in North China. This is something that European and American overseas Chinese in China should pay special attention to. At the time of the establishment of the puppet "Huaxing Bank," it is said that Shanghai's Chinese and foreign banks and money houses decided not to cooperate. This is a necessary measure for the people of Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, to protect their own economic interests in central China!

Lishui, a shield for Nanjing and an important stronghold on the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway, had been lost for 18 months. Chinese forces had counter-attacked several times without success. The fact that Chinese forces captured two locations in a matter of hours indicates that the Japanese army no longer possesses combat capabilities.

### Li Xiaqing's Fundraising in the United States Achieves Excellent Results

(Washington) Chinese female aviators Li Luqing and Yan Yaqing, after deciding to fly to various parts of the United States to raise funds for their homeland, set off separately. Li flew from Boston to Miami on March 30th. The local government immediately sent a special car to greet her. Under the leadership of the mayor's wife, an unprecedented banquet was held, attended by more than 600 women from all walks of life. The University of Miami held a meeting with more than 1,500 university students, offering a warm welcome. During fundraising in the area, a Mr. Grande, in light of China's heroic resistance and the brutal killing or displacement of civilians by the Japanese invaders, took the lead by donating $1,000. A certain lady also generously donated $5,000. There were many other smaller donations. This promising start can be seen as a precursor to future success. On April 8th, she continued flying to New Orleans, where the governor and mayor both extended extremely sincere receptions and took the lead in donating to encourage others. During her three-day stay, all the city's newspapers carried stories about the new model for women in China, and those who previously held indifferent attitudes toward Far Eastern issues also underwent a change, shifting from attention to concern. The pro-China atmosphere is becoming increasingly strong. On April 11th, she flew to Houston. Li's broadcast on a local radio station about the Three Resolutions has already attracted great attention from all sectors. After changing to a new plane in Washington, Ms. Yan Yaqing is more actively expanding the extent of her flights, extending her trip until the end of July. (Editor's note: Yan was slightly injured in a plane crash in Prattville on May 1st, and the original schedule may need to be changed.) She then set off for Philadelphia. On the morning of that day, those who saw her off at the airport included Bishop Yu Bin, all the staff of the special representative office of the Relief Commission, Counselor Chen Changle of the Embassy, Military Attaché Shao, representatives of overseas Chinese, and many newspaper reporters.

### Chinese Army Units Attacking Xuzhou Are Currently Surrounding Xuzhou

Taixian Correspondence: A certain unit of the Chinese army, which had previously moved from Huaibei back to the Xuzhou area, joined forces with the Pixian Standing Detachment, the county police force, and coordinated with the × Road Army. One part advanced towards Taierzhuang, detouring to attack Xuzhou. On April 6th, they advanced to the area of Sihuliangbi and unexpectedly encountered several hundred Japanese infantry and artillery soldiers, along with five or six armored vehicles, coming south from the Tai-Zhao branch road. The local residents had previously dug many trenches along the road to prevent Japanese heavy weaponry from entering, so when the Japanese army used armored vehicles to charge toward the Chinese army's position, two of them fell into the trenches and could not move. The Chinese army seized the opportunity to encircle and attack, destroying two Japanese armored vehicles and killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army then deployed four cannons and concentrated their fire. The Chinese army then shifted its forces westward, crossing the Tai-Yue Road. The Japanese army then rushed to Sihuliangbi and Daxiao Liangbi, setting fire to them, turning both villages to ashes, and killing five or sixty residents who had not had time to escape, to vent their anger. The Chinese army then dispatched troops to attack the flanks and rear of the Japanese army, and sent a capable force to advance northwest, attacking Taierzhuang, and engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese garrison and the Japanese army that came south to reinforce them. After holding out for several hours, they shifted their forces west to the Xiaotashan area on the border of Tong and Pi. However, when passing through the Tai-Zhao branch line, they destroyed many sections of the railway. They are still garrisoning troops in the Xiaotashan area on the border of Tong and Pi. The Japanese army has transferred troops from Xuzhou to reinforce them, and are constantly engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese army. The sound of artillery can be heard in the city of Xuzhou. The Chinese army is familiar with the terrain and is preparing to attack Xuzhou when the opportunity arises.

Another report states that since the arrival of the × unit of the Chinese army in the Lu-Su border area, the morale of the people has become increasingly elevated. The Japanese army in Xuzhou feels greatly threatened. The presence of the × unit of the Chinese army has been detected west of Taierzhuang and east of Xuzhou, and they are continuing to intensify the encirclement of Xuzhou. At the same time, Chinese local teams and civilian armed forces are working hard to destroy the Japanese transportation lines. The Japanese army in Xuzhou is panicking and has sent telegrams to the Japanese army headquarters requesting reinforcements.

Yangzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army in Yangzhou has recently been greatly alarmed by the full-scale counter-offensive launched by the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu. In order to prevent the Chinese army from attacking them, they have dispatched several hundred infantry and artillery soldiers (including a unit of puppet troops) to continuously patrol various places in the northeast, attempting to carry out their so-called pacification work. At the same time, they are intensifying the forced recruitment of able-bodied men to organize puppet troops in order to cultivate the power of traitors for their own use. The "Broadsword Society," which was previously organized by the Japanese army, has recently risen up in rebellion because of the excessive oppression by the Japanese puppets, and because the able-bodied men in the society have been arbitrarily forced by the Japanese army to join the puppet troops, forcing them to kill each other, which is completely contrary to the conditions of protecting their homeland. Therefore, they have risen up in rebellion and have made contact with the guerrilla forces lurking in the suburbs, renaming themselves the Broadsword Brigade and launching continuous attacks on the Japanese army. As a result, the Japanese army is in great panic. On the morning of the 14th, a Japanese patrol unit of more than 300 infantry and artillery soldiers was ambushed by the Chinese army in Lizhen Town. The Broadsword Brigade also rose up to help in the battle, surrounding them on three sides. The puppet troops fled without firing a shot, causing the Japanese front line to be in chaos. The Chinese army took the opportunity to kill them, and countless were shot or hacked to death with broadswords. By 12:00 noon, the Japanese were unable to withstand the assault and fled in panic to the west. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered fifty or sixty casualties, with more than thirty bodies left behind. The Chinese army captured three small steel cannons, one machine gun, and nine rifles, and captured two Japanese soldiers.

Bai Yutang, the puppet commander of the Yangzhou-Zhenjiang area puppet river pacification, has imposed pressure on the local people and distributed his lackeys to search for and collect civilian guns and extort civilian property since taking office as a puppet official. His crimes are numerous, causing widespread resentment among the people. Recently, the Japanese army ordered him to harass the Chinese army, but Bai did not dare to act rashly due to his limited strength, and only made excuses. The Japanese army was furious because of this, believing that Bai was not working hard and must have ulterior motives. On the 15th, Bai was arrested in Shijiaoqiao, shackled with heavy shackles, and escorted to Zhenjiang for interrogation. It is said that Bai has been executed by shooting in Zhenjiang. The fate of the traitor is like this, and it can serve as a warning to his kind.

### Japanese Army in Jiangyin Invades Church Hospital

Jiangyin Correspondence: The American Presbyterian Church has been preaching Christianity in Jiangyin for more than forty years. The first pastor was named Hai, followed by Pastor Li Deli and Medical Doctor Hua Erde, and others. They founded Lizhi Boys' Middle School, Fushi Girls' Middle School, and Shengdao Hospital, along with various public charitable undertakings. Most of the buildings on Henan Street in Dongwai are church property. Because of Jiangyin's importance as a fortress, whenever internal wars broke out in the past, any disputes were often peacefully resolved through the mediation of Hua Erde and others. The most complete of the various undertakings they founded was Shengdao Hospital, which treated countless male and female patients every year. The shortfall in finances was subsidized by the Presbyterian Church in Huntington, USA. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan the previous year, Jiangyin fell, and the school and hospital buildings were destroyed by fire. Most Christians were evacuated. Hospital staff, led by Pastor Mu Weide and Director Chen Yulin, and dozens of male and female nurses, hired boats to take the important medicines and equipment in the hospital to Zhangjia Village in Xintuo Town, Wujin, to stay temporarily, while still treating patients. Last spring, they moved to Qiaoqi Town. In March of this year, Pastor Mu and the doctors and nurses returned to Dongwai and set up a treatment center in the remaining buildings, offering outpatient services on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday mornings and afternoons. Starting in mid-April, they offered outpatient services in the morning and house calls in the afternoon. Unexpectedly, the head of the Japanese military special forces Jiangyin squad, Pu Huixiong, informed the puppet police station a few days ago and ordered Shengdao Hospital to stop treating patients, causing great inconvenience to the residents of Jiangyin. The Christian church has already appealed to the American consulate about this matter.

### American Chamber of Commerce Vigorously Advocates Maintaining the Far Eastern Market, Even if it Means War with Japan; American Ambassador Johnson to Return to China Tomorrow

(Washington) The United States Chamber of Commerce Federation held a banquet here last night. Representatives from all American commercial firms with interests abroad participated. The representatives stated that the United States must find a way to maintain its markets in China and the Philippine Islands, even if it means war with Japan. In addition, they also advocated providing credit loans to Latin American countries and selling them gold to develop trade and compete with European countries. Francis, the vice president of the Sino-American Chamber of Commerce, said that the Chinese government is currently planning to develop industry. The implementation of this plan could enable the United States to export goods worth 750 million US dollars to China annually for the next generation, but only on the condition that the country's market is not monopolized by Japan. "In order to protect trade, our country is willing to resort to war when necessary. If a country can maintain its independent sovereignty and become our country's most important future customer, then for the sake of our country's interests, we should protect trade with that country." If the Chinese market is blocked by Japan, our country's market in the Philippine Islands will inevitably be lost as a result. (3rd Havas Dispatch)

(San Francisco) American Ambassador to China Johnson, who had returned to the country to report on the situation in the Far East to President Roosevelt, is now preparing to depart on Friday to return to his post. Johnson told reporters today that the war in the Far East will be protracted for a long time because the basis for a peaceful solution is still lacking, and China has abundant food and clothing, and its people are highly motivated. Furthermore, Japanese planes arbitrarily bomb the residential centers of the Chinese people, which only intensifies the Chinese people's animosity towards Japan. "When the Chinese people encounter Japanese air raids, their discipline is amazing. When the planes drop bombs, the people do not panic. After an hour, they work together to remove the corpses, and the injured are sent to the hospital for treatment, and the market trade is restored." (3rd United Press Dispatch)

### French Government Restricts Imports of Japanese Goods: Consular Visa Method to be Implemented Starting This Month

(Paris) Since the outbreak of the war between China and Japan, Japan has strictly managed the exchange rate. France's trade with Japan has changed from a trade surplus to a trade deficit. In order to remedy this, the government has decided to implement consular visa methods for Japanese goods. The government gazette recently issued an order, stating that starting from the 10th of this month, various Japanese goods, except raw silk and camphor (natural camphor that has not been purified, camphor powder produced on the island of Taiwan, and purified camphor and artificial camphor are all included), that are transported to France or to French colonies must be accompanied by a special certificate signed by the commercial counselor of the French Embassy in Japan or by the French consul, otherwise they will be prohibited from import. However, various goods that have been loaded onto ships for export before May 10th are not subject to this provision. (2nd Havas Dispatch)

(Paris) After the government decided to implement consular visa methods for Japanese imports starting from the 10th of this month, responsible persons explained that this measure is not to prohibit the import of Japanese goods. Since goods exported from France to Japan are subject to restrictions in that country, and the commercial talks between Japan and France are progressing very slowly, this measure is being implemented so that retaliatory measures can be taken against Japan when necessary. Once a commercial agreement is reached, it may be revoked. (3rd Havas Dispatch)

(London) A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph claimed that regarding the dispute between Germany and Poland, Britain will allow the Polish government to decide on its own how to handle the matter.

(3rd Haitian Dispatch)

(Berlin) German attacks on Poland are becoming increasingly fierce. The points that various newspapers focus on are: (1) Poland now seems to have forgotten that it is next to a strong neighbor; (2) Poland is too confident after receiving assurances of British assistance. Political circles here predict that Germany will not take active action regarding the dispute with Poland before Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's speech on May 5th. According to travelers coming here from the German-Polish border, all major cities are now full of troops. However, official sources claim that there are always heavily guarded troops along the border, and there have been no abnormal troop movements recently.

### New British Battleship Launched: HMS Prince of Wales

(London) The 35,000-ton new battleship HMS Prince of Wales was launched today at the Birkinhead shipyard. Ten thousand people watched the event. This ship is a sister ship to HMS King George V and is equipped with ten 14-inch guns, sixteen 5.25-inch guns, and several smaller gun emplacements.

In addition, there are many more that are being planned. The total tonnage of these new ships will reach one million tons. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)

### Britain Prepares to Exchange Security Guarantees with Germany; Chamberlain Announces in Parliament that the Policy of Encirclement Is Groundless

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain, in response to inquiries from Labour MP Henderson in the House of Commons today, stated that he would make it clear in his upcoming speech that the notion of Britain adopting a policy of encircling Germany is entirely unfounded.  President Roosevelt's proposal, and that offered by Hitler, involve an exchange of non-aggression guarantees, not on a mutual basis, as with the guarantee recently given to Poland. The British government is indeed prepared to consider the suggestion of exchanging mutual guarantees with the German government.  Regarding Germany's abrogation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the British government considers that the guarantee recently given to Poland does not conflict with the naval agreement. There is no clause in the agreement that allows one of the contracting parties to deem the agreement as effective. He cannot decide if this is another treaty proposal made by Hitler, but the government is considering how to respond.  Naval Secretary Stanhope then declared that, as a result of the abandonment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, a decision on whether to dismantle or retain the two "King George V" class battleships armed with 15-inch guns has not yet been made.  An MP inquired of Foreign Minister Butler if the U.S. government had sent a copy of its recent statement to the Japanese government regarding the opening of the Yangtze River to merchant shipping to the British government. Butler replied in the affirmative. Butler also stated that the British government is not engaged in making the guarantees given to Romania and Greece of a mutual nature.  An MP asked if the Shanghai Municipal Council had been permitted to continue dredging the waterways at the entrance to Shanghai. Butler replied in the negative, adding that active negotiations with the Japanese authorities in Shanghai are underway and a compromise is expected soon.  Conservative MP Milner then questioned that these negotiations have been ongoing for too long, and the work of the Council is internationally related to the shipping industry of various countries, and that the Foreign Minister should give greater weight to further negotiations. Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax is fully aware of the importance of the Council's work and hopes that the ongoing negotiations will yield a more promising response. (Reuter, 3rd)

### Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Visit Germany, No Agreement Reached

Hungarian Capital Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csáky returned here this morning at 9:00 AM from Berlin. Cabinet members and many dignitaries welcomed them at the station. Government Party Leader Tiaryon delivered a brief welcoming speech, stating that the opinions of Germany and Hungary were harmonious. Prime Minister Teleki replied that his observations during the trip led him to believe that Germany has genuine and deep friendship for Hungary, "and that both sides can cooperate in good faith to seek welfare for both nations and strive to maintain peace in Central Europe."  The official news agency issued a statement stating, "The relationship between Germany and Hungary has always been close and does not need to be formalized in writing. Therefore, Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csáky did not sign any agreement with the German authorities." Strengthening relations among countries in the Danube River region was also discussed. Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csáky also told the news agency, "The task of our trip has been completed. In essence, the talks held with the German authorities are the best guarantee for maintaining a friendly environment between the two countries. (Havas, 3rd)

### Germany Suggests Security Pact to Four Nordic Nations; Sweden Says Germany Only Seeking Opinions; Åland Islands Fortification Issue Resolved

(Berlin) When Chancellor Hitler gave a speech the other day, he said that if the countries referred to in President Roosevelt's telegram requested guarantees from Germany, Germany was prepared to provide mutual guarantees under absolutely mutual principles. According to reliable sources, the German government has already conducted negotiations with the Nordic countries based on this speech, hoping to conclude bilateral guarantee agreements." This is also said in competent circles, that the German government has conducted preliminary talks with certain countries. (Havas, 2nd)

Swedish Capital It is rumored that the German government has begun negotiations with the Nordic countries (i.e., Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland) in the hope of concluding non-aggression treaties. Responsible figures here recently denied it, saying that Germany has not conducted such negotiations, but has only sought the opinions of the Nordic countries to find out if there is any hope of success if a proposal for negotiations is put forward. (Havas, 3rd)

(Berlin) The agreement between Finland and Sweden on the issue of fortifying the Åland Islands has recently been accepted by the German government. (Havas, 3rd)

(Berlin) According to reliable sources, the German government recently issued a note to Sweden and Finland regarding the Åland Islands issue, stating that Germany must agree to Finland's fortification of the island under certain conditions. The Åland Islands are located in the Baltic Sea, between Finland and Sweden, at the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia, with a strategic location. Until 1917, it belonged to Russia, and in 1921, it was assigned to Finland by the League of Nations Administrative Council. Russia's declaration of 1856 not to set up defenses on the island was also inherited by Finland, and a treaty was signed by Britain, Sweden, Finland, and the Soviet Union to certify it. At the beginning of January this year, Finland and Sweden decided on a plan to allow Finland to fortify the island due to changes in the international situation. The main points are as follows: (1) Finland may take military measures in the southern part of the Åland Islands; (2) Finland may only take limited military measures in the northern part of the island, with a term of ten years, the scope of which shall be stipulated by separate agreements between Finland and Sweden; (3) Finland may implement a conscription system in the country, but must appoint Swedish officers and sergeants to garrison the island and issue orders in Swedish. The above measures will be submitted to the Finnish Parliament for discussion, and after they are passed, a meeting of representatives of the residents of the Åland Islands will be held for approval. (Havas, 2nd)

### Polish Foreign Minister to Deliver Speech Tomorrow, Adopting Offensive Diplomacy, Announcing Stance on Danzig, German Press Retorts

Warsaw  Certain well-informed sources here recently declared that Foreign Minister Beck is scheduled to deliver a statement to the House of Representatives on the 5th of this month, in response to German Chancellor Hitler's speech on April 28th, proposing to place the Free City of Danzig under Polish protection. The steps are nothing more than: (1) Polish land and naval forces should be stationed in Danzig; (2) The Polish government should have the power to veto any decisions made by the city council; (3) The city's heavy industry should be placed under Polish control to prevent it from supplying Germany with munitions. As for the German reaction to this, once it is revealed, it will be clear whether Chancellor Hitler is still intimidating with empty threats or is willing to reach an understanding with Poland. If Hitler is truly sincere in wanting to reconcile with Poland, then both sides can make concessions and come to a compromise solution. In short, Polish military circles are all advocating for an offensive stance towards Germany. It is said that although Germany can occupy the Free City of Danzig within three hours, Polish troops will be able to arrive first, and it can be asserted that the only railway and highway line from the German province of East Prussia to the city must pass through Polish territory, making it difficult to operate freely. As for the attitudes of other countries, they are also favorable to Poland. British Ambassador Kennard has repeatedly stated to Foreign Minister Beck that if Poland believes it is being threatened by Germany, and if Poland deems it necessary to intervene in Danzig, Britain will provide unreserved assistance. The French government has also provided the same guarantee. In addition, Lithuanian Army Commander-in-Chief General Raštikis, at the invitation of Polish Army Inspector General General Śmigły-Rydz, is scheduled to come here before the 8th of this month to discuss close military cooperation to resist German aggression. As for the relationship between Poland and the Soviet Union, it is developing smoothly. Although Poland is unwilling to conclude a political or military agreement with the Soviet Union, it also openly acknowledges that the Soviet Union can provide Poland with great assistance, especially in supplying raw materials. In addition, as far as the domestic situation in Poland is concerned, all the government's efforts are supported by the people. For example, since the issuance of national defense bonds, two hundred million złoty (Polish currency) have been sold in a few weeks, which is one aspect of it. Also, although May 1st is International Labor Day, most union members are still willing to work as usual and donate their wages to the national defense fund. In addition, the Polish government is actively preparing in terms of military and industry. All officers in the army's specialized units and reserves have been ordered to report for duty to take on special tasks. Reserve soldiers have also been enlisted in batches for short-term training. Various raw materials and grains have also been stockpiled as much as possible to avoid being taken advantage of by any incident. (Havas, 2nd)

Warsaw  The Dziennik Bydgoski, an important newspaper here, recently published a long article describing the historical relationship between Poland and the German province of East Prussia. According to Article 96 of the Treaty of Versailles, the German authorities should hold a referendum in Warmia and Masuria in East Prussia to decide whether the localities should belong to Poland or Germany, but the country's authorities have not yet done so. "We therefore have the right to demand that a solution be found to the East Prussian question, because from any point of view, whether historical, geographical, or economic, the province is closely linked to Poland, and the local residents also speak Slavic languages and have not yet been 'Germanized.'" (Havas, 3rd)

(Berlin) Yesterday, all the newspapers in Berlin published articles on the front page discussing the issue of German-Polish relations. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung commented, "Since the signing of the agreement between Polish Prime Minister Piłsudski and Chancellor Hitler in January 1934, Poland has achieved its current status as a major power. The Franco-Polish alliance established between Poland and France in 1921 and the non-aggression treaty signed with Soviet Russia in 1932 failed to make Poland a major power. Poland is now colluding with Britain, implementing a policy of encirclement, and abandoning its historical mission as a buffer state between its eastern and western neighbors. In reality, Britain's interests in protecting the western borders of the Soviet Union from Labrador to Bessarabia are greater than Poland's interests in Danzig. However, the balance of power that Poland has always paid attention to has now been suddenly lost." (Haitong, 3rd)

(Berlin) The main topic of discussion in Polish newspapers these days is Poland's attitude towards Danzig and Upper Silesia. This morning, the German newspapers severely criticized it. The Völkischer Beobachter, the mouthpiece of the Nazi Party, believes that the propaganda of Polish newspapers is at least condoned by the Polish government, or even carries out the government's intentions. As for Chamberlain and Daladier, who have recently positioned themselves as protectors of Poland, they have taken a hands-off approach to the rhetoric of Polish newspapers without comment, which is quite noteworthy. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung is highly ironic about Poland's demand to be the protector of Danzig. (Haitong, 3rd)

### Poland Celebrates National Day with Military Parade

Warsaw  The First Republic of Poland was founded in 1791. Today marks the 148th anniversary, and celebrations are taking place enthusiastically throughout the country. Major cities are holding military parades. National flags are hung all over the streets of the city, and most stores display portraits of the late Minister of Military Affairs Piłsudski, the current Inspector General of Military Education Śmigły-Rydz, and Foreign Minister Beck. Foreign embassies, including the Czechoslovakian embassy, also display their respective national flags. (Havas, 3rd)

### Anglo-Portuguese Friendship

Lisbon  The President of Portugal, Carmona, presented the country's highest medal to King George VI of England. According to the government gazette, Portugal's move is enough to prove the centuries-old friendship between England and Portugal. The Portuguese people have feelings for the British government and the public, and the ancient alliance between England and Portugal is still valid. (Reuter, 2nd)

### Anglo-Russian Negotiations are Slow; MPs Raise Questions; Talk of Meeting Between British, French, and Russian Foreign Ministers; Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Talks with Turkish Officials

(London) During the afternoon meeting of the House of Commons today, Major Attlee, leader of the opposition Labour Party, raised questions about the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, saying that the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union have been going on for a long time without reaching an agreement, and that some of the public in this country have become impatient. He asked whether the government was actively conducting negotiations. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied that the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are currently in progress, and the two sides have put forward many plans and counter-plans. The details of which cannot be disclosed before substantial achievements have been made. "I cannot prevent those who have doubts, but I am convinced that Mr. Attlee will not encourage such doubts, nor will he want to stir up trouble between Britain and the Soviet Union. In short, the talks between Britain and the Soviet Union are very harmonious, and the British government has never lacked sincerity. The two sides will consider all the details and take into account the views of other governments." (Havas, 2nd)

(London) Regarding the establishment of a collective security system, Prime Minister Chamberlain recently delivered a speech in the House of Commons, providing some explanations on the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. According to sources close to the government, British Foreign Secretary Halifax, French Foreign Minister Bonnet, and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov will meet in Paris or London to finalize the draft agreement to be established between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is heard that the Soviet government will propose three suggestions: (1) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should sign an alliance treaty; (2) The countries along the Baltic and Black Seas should be jointly guaranteed by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union; (3) Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland may be guaranteed by the Soviet Union. The British government will also make suggestions advocating three things: (1) The Soviet Union should follow Britain and France in providing guarantees to Poland and Romania; (2) The Soviet Union should provide unilateral guarantees to other neighboring countries, namely Finland, Estonia, and Latvia, but when and what kind of assistance these countries require from the Soviet Union should be determined by these countries; (3) Once the Soviet Union provides unilateral guarantees to the above countries, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should sign a mutual assistance agreement. Moreover, according to British political figures, the Soviet government still has objections to the proposals made by Britain, but when its neighboring countries are invaded in the future, they can first request assistance from Britain and France, and then ask the Soviet Union for help to avoid the Soviet Union taking on the burden alone. If the British government puts forward this method to the Soviet Union, the country may not express any further objections. As far as the British proposal is concerned, there is no longer a risk of Soviet troops automatically passing through the borders of the Baltic countries, which is one of its advantages. (Havas, 2nd)

(London) Regarding the establishment of a collective security system, the British government is actively conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union on the one hand, and closely monitoring the negotiations between Romania, Turkey, and Bulgaria, because Romania and Turkey are currently trying to bring Bulgaria into the Balkan Entente. The suggestions made by the British government to Bulgaria have been taken back to Bulgaria by the country's envoy to England, Monchilov, for instructions. The envoy is scheduled to return here tomorrow to continue talks with the British authorities. According to responsible figures here, the goal of the Balkan Entente was to resist Bulgarian aggression. Today, what the Balkan countries want to worry about is external aggression, not the aggression of one Balkan country. This kind of entente no longer needs to maintain its original form and should establish a new entente. It is heard that Bulgaria is preparing to participate in this new entente, but with two conditions: (1) Romania must return Dobruja (which belonged to Bulgaria before the war) to Bulgaria; (2) Greece must cede the port of Dedeağaç on the Aegean Sea to Bulgaria as its access to the sea. If Romania and Greece cannot do so immediately, they must provide guarantees that they will be willing to fulfill these conditions once the situation permits. Bulgaria may also consider it satisfactory. In addition, according to well-informed sources here, the Italian government recently proposed to Bulgaria that it should unite the countries concerned under its leadership to form a group of neutral countries in the Balkan Peninsula, but the Bulgarian government's attitude is very cold. (Havas, 2nd)

Turkish Capital Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin has been negotiating with Turkish authorities for five days, but has not yet reached a conclusion. The date of his return has therefore been postponed. The details of the negotiations are still unknown. In addition, General Weygand, former Chief of the General Staff of the French Army (Chief of Staff of the late General Foch), recently came here from the capital of Iran and was received by the President. (Havas, 3rd)

### Spain Disgusted with German-Italian Pressure; Italian Troops to Withdraw Soon

(London) The Duke of Alba, Ambassador of the Spanish Nationalist government to Britain, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax today. It is heard that he provided new assurances to the Foreign Secretary that once the Nationalist army triumphantly enters Madrid on the 15th of this month, Italian volunteers will withdraw from Spain. According to sources close to the Foreign Office, there is good reason to believe that the Italian infantry units will all withdraw from Spain before the 25th of this month. It seems that those in the Nationalist government who advocate resisting the pressure from Germany and Italy have become increasingly powerful. (Havas, 2nd)

The Southern Irish MPs in the opposition party also support this attitude of the Southern Irish government. (Reuter, 2nd)

(London) Northern Ireland Prime Minister Craigavon arrived here yesterday and held talks with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Chancellor of the Exchequer Hoare for half an hour before concluding. He also made a statement, "The Northern Ireland Parliament passed a resolution last year, willing to allow the British government to use all its resources.

### Hua Army Soldier Wang Shulin Steals Japanese Military Mail

— Zhang Changren

Disguised as a Farmer, He Penetrates the Japanese Camp in Yueyang and Obtains Much Reference Material for the War of Resistance

While in Changsha, I heard the news that Wang Shulin, a soldier of the × Division of the Hua Army in northern Hunan, had penetrated the Japanese camp and stolen a large amount of Japanese military mail. Therefore, on April 2nd, I departed from Changsha on a journey to inspect the front line in northern Hunan, inquiring about the location of the soldier's unit, intending to interview him. Upon reaching Miluo, I learned that his unit was guarding the first line of defense on the south bank of the Xinqiang River. On April 10th, I arrived near the division headquarters of that division near the Xinqiang River, but he had just been ordered to depart for Yueyang to investigate enemy intelligence, and we missed each other. On the 16th, I finally met him in ××× on the south bank of the Miluo River. He had already completed his mission and safely returned with Japanese documents, boxes, and other items.

Mr. Wang has delicate features and a medium build. Dressed in black short shirt and trousers, he answered the reporter's questions calmly and logically. He was very humble in demeanor, but his movements and actions showed that he had received military education for many years. After completing his report, he still deeply regretted his lack of education despite his patriotic heart. I happened to have a Japanese spy book with me, so I especially gave it to him, hoping it could slightly increase his knowledge of espionage.

According to the Chief of Staff of the × Division, Mr. Wang is quite courageous and has a great ambition. Every time he decides to take action, he always aims to achieve other goals besides the original mission. He is adept at detecting counter-espionage activities when he discovers their espionage cells and is sure to eliminate them. He is truly a talented spy. Here is a record of Mr. Wang's conversation:

My name is Wang Shulin, from ×××, Yueyang. I am twenty-three years old this year. My father has passed away, and my mother is over sixty years old. She and my elder brothers and sisters-in-law are still farming in ××× to make a living, barely making ends meet.

At the age of fourteen, I graduated from a small school in my hometown and joined the Yueyang County Government Security Team as a servant. A year later, I officially became a member of the Security Team. At the age of seventeen, I felt that the future of being in the Security Team was limited, so I was introduced by a friend to the machine gun battalion of the Garrison Headquarters in Nanjing. In December of the Republic of China's 26th year (1937), this machine gun battalion was transferred to the command of the 51st Division of the Army. On December 13th, I was wounded in action near Yuhuatai outside the south gate of the capital Nanjing. I was treated in wounded soldier hospitals in Huanggang and Wuchang, northern Hunan, and returned to my home in Yueyang to recuperate at the end of January last year. By March, I had fully recovered. I saw that the country had reached this point, and there was no better thing for young people to do than to be a soldier, so I joined the Yueyang Regular Team again. In November of last year, the × Division was fighting in the Xinqiang area. Because I am a local, I was recruited as a plainclothes team member.

For the past five months, I and my comrades in the plainclothes team have often entered the enemy's rear in the Yueyang area to scout out enemy intelligence. I have been arrested four times, but I have escaped each time. My stealing of the enemy's military mail was an opportunity I encountered after my first arrest.

That was on January 9th. I was ordered to depart from the guerrilla camp near Yuanshaozhong Village to scout out the area near Yunxi Station, thirty or forty li east of Yueyang. I disguised myself as a farmer in Pingdi Quanjia, carrying a load of sweet potatoes and entered the enemy's warning line to the north. In advance, I obtained a piece of cloth called a "Good Citizen Certificate" (four inches long and two and a half inches wide, with the words "Identity Certificate" written horizontally on top, followed by sections for "Name," "Address," "Occupation," and "Age," signed by the ××× Self-Governance Committee). In addition to the committee's seal, there was a small oval stamp with "Naito" on the corner of the cloth). The enemy wanted to lure the people back to their hometowns, so they let me pass when they saw this cloth. Between the front lines of the enemy and our army, there were more than ten li where the common people were still farming. The enemy's general fortifications were not much different from ours, but the stronghold fortifications were mostly constructed with steel and concrete, and there were two or three layers of barbed wire outside. They could only be collapsed with artillery. They were well concealed, and it was sometimes difficult to detect them even up close. When I arrived at Yunxi Station, I was surrounded by a dozen Japanese soldiers. At first, they casually ate my sweet potatoes. Finally, a military policeman came and persuaded me to become a puppet soldier, and forced me to walk with him with a gun. The streets of Yunxi were close to the railway station. After walking a short distance, I was diverted into a city house. This house was also surrounded by barbed wire. As I walked in, I paid attention to the exit. It was a row of three rooms. He pushed me into the middle room and locked me in.

There were already five or six farmers in their twenties and thirties in the room. Everyone was both angry and scared, sitting on the hay. Although they did not know me, they expressed sympathy for my misfortune. Looking at the window lattices, they were not very strong. I thought that escaping might only be possible through this way.

I went in at a little after three o'clock in the afternoon. After five o'clock, another military policeman suddenly opened the door and called me out. He gestured for me to sweep the house for them. I happily picked up the broom. On the left side of the door, I smelled the sign of "Dai Nippon Post Office." I peeked into the window and saw many letters and paper rolls piled up on the long table in the window. I guessed it was a military post office. On the right side was the kitchen. I glanced at a shiny kitchen knife on the cutting board, seven or eight inches long and two inches wide, which looked a bit like a butcher knife. I cleaned it up and, taking advantage of the Japanese soldiers' unpreparedness, took it and hid it in my coat. Then, I let him lock me back in the middle room, giving me a small tube of polished rice with a small piece of rather fishy salted fish on top.

I silently hid the knife in the grass. None of the people in the room knew. Then, I sat near the wall, watching the gradually darkening sky outside the window, listening to the sound of the Japanese soldiers' leather shoes and horses' hooves. At the same time, with my hands behind my back, I used the knife to dig a small hole in the ground and buried the knife in it. When it was dark, the people in the room all fell asleep on the grass. Listening outside, the number of people walking had also decreased. I took out the knife in the darkness and began to slowly cut through the window lattice. It took me more than two hours to remove three of them, enough for one person to squeeze through.

It was eleven o'clock. Hearing the loud snoring of the Japanese soldiers, I jumped out of the window. At the same time, I decided that escaping after stealing the military mail was the only way to be worthy of the trouble. I walked to the window of the "post office," pushed it, but it was locked inside. I tried to pry it open, but it didn't move. The two large packages of mail on the table seduced me in the dim night. I gently broke the glass, then reached in and opened the window. I grabbed a package in one hand. However, I don't know if it was because I was panicked at the time, or because the long table was not stable, it "crashed" over. In this way, I only had thirty-six strategies left, and running away was the best one. I immediately strode out of the house, stepped over the short barbed wire door, and fled into the darkness to the southwest. The enemy's military police followed and chased after me. With the sound of a gunshot, the enemy hiding in the fortifications also blindly fired into the darkness, like the so-called "one dog barks at a shadow, a hundred dogs bark at the sound." After running three or four li, the enemy's bullets were still whistling over my head. At this time, I felt that the things I was carrying were too heavy (each package of mail weighed eight or nine catties) and I couldn't run fast. I decided to endure the pain and abandon one package. After walking another six or seven li, the dense gunfire fell far behind me.

So I rested for a while in the pine forest on the small mountain, and then slowly carried that package of mail back.

At dawn, I had to cross the enemy's newly built automobile road south of Yueyang. I saw six or seven sentries walking towards me half a mile away. I crossed without any concern. By the time they discovered me and shouted for me to stop, I had already entered the mountain forest on the side of the road. They chased for a while, but ultimately did not dare to chase into the woods.

Two days later, I returned to the division headquarters, presented my spoils of war, and reported the course of events in detail. That package of mail was wrapped in Japanese cloth. Inside, there were more than four hundred letters and dozens of newspapers and magazines. It was immediately forwarded to the higher-level military headquarters. Later, I learned that there was much material in it for us to use as a reference. There was also fresher proof of the enemy soldiers' war-weariness. Among them, there was also a list of wounded enemy soldiers in the troops fighting us in South Suzhou. In one battalion (according to the reporter, a Japanese battalion consists of four companies, each with more than two hundred and ten people, with more than seventy light and heavy machine guns, with greater firepower than our regiment), the number of wounded reached one hundred and fifty, not including those killed in action. The "Wuhan News," run by traitors, was also seen for the first time.

The division commander rewarded me with twenty yuan immediately. Within a few days, the military headquarters and the army corps headquarters also successively rewarded me with two hundred yuan each. I was also promoted from corporal to sergeant. I am truly very grateful. However, rewards and promotions are not my purpose for working. I only hate that I have read too little and cannot help the country more.

When I was in Yueyang, I often met the commander of the Tsuda Regiment, riding a foreign horse alone, holding a pistol, to the homes of our female compatriots that he had seized. I really wanted to find a way to take a gun and finish him off, but for a greater purpose, I have not yet received the order to do so. (April 7th, on the south bank of Miluo ××)

### Three Japanese Planes Attack Fuzhou Three Times in One Day

More Than Thirty Bombs Dropped; More Than Thirty Shops and Homes Destroyed; More Than One Hundred Civilians Killed and Wounded; Losses Exceed One Million Yuan

Fuzhou Correspondence: In recent months, Japanese planes have repeatedly raided Fuzhou, attempting to exert pressure. However, the severity of the disaster has not been greater than on April 25th. The details of what happened are briefly described below:

First Time

On the night of April 24th, four Japanese warships sailed to the mouth of the Minjiang River and anchored at Nangan Tang and Mazu Ao. Among them was a large destroyer carrying four planes. Three planes took off at 7:05 AM on the 25th and invaded the airspace of Fuzhou. They circled the city once, first dropping ten bombs (three of which were incendiary bombs) in the most bustling Jiangbin Road in the commercial district of Nantai. The Xinxin Hotel, Huamei Soap Factory, Hualai Ginseng Shop, Tianyi Ginseng Shop, and Xiangkang Ginseng Shop, and Shangyuan Hospital were all bombed and immediately caught fire. More than ten people were killed and more than thirty were injured. At 7:50 AM, the plane

Second Time

At 8:50 AM, the three planes took off from the warship again and invaded the city's airspace, first dropping twelve bombs (three of which were incendiary bombs) on Jiangbin Road. The Pingan Silk and Cloth Shop, Caishen Silk and Cloth Shop, Hongfa Food Shop, Wanfu Food Shop, Baijia Su Guang Shop, Tianbao Jewelry Store, Baili Wine Shop, Zhaoxin Su Guang Shop, Longfu Money Shop, Baoyuan Rice Shop, and Taian Hotel were all bombed and immediately caught fire. More than twenty people were killed and more than fifty were injured. Then, three bombs (one of which was an incendiary bomb) were dropped in front of the Gulou (Drum Tower) in the city. The Huafang Photography Studio was completely destroyed. The Civilized Bookstore and the back of the Meihe Dim Sum Shop were bombed, killing three people and injuring more than ten.

Third Time

At 10:50 AM, the plane flew back to the warship. At 0:30 PM, the plane took off from the warship again and invaded the city's airspace, dropping two bombs on Hongwu Road in Nantai. The Yili Sawmill was bombed, killing nine people and injuring more than ten. One bomb was dropped at Wanbianjiao, with no deaths or injuries. Three bombs (one of which was an incendiary bomb) were dropped on the first dock of Jiangbin Road. The Xintai Warehouse was destroyed. More than ten wooden houses built by poor people from the north around the warehouse were completely destroyed. Five or six people were also killed and more than ten were injured. Then, three bombs (one of which was an incendiary bomb) were dropped on Shengfu Road, burning only three houses, with no deaths or injuries. At 1:30 PM, it flew back to the warship.

Total Losses

In summary, there were three bombings that day, with a total of more than thirty bombs dropped, all in prosperous urban areas. More than thirty shops and homes were burned down, more than forty people were killed, and more than one hundred were injured. The losses are estimated to be over one million yuan. The reporter went to the bombed area of Jiangbin Road at 3:00 PM on the 25th, but saw walls collapsing and houses falling, with piles of bricks and tiles like mountains. Everywhere smelled of burning. Corpses lay across the roads, some with broken heads and severed limbs, some with only half a body left, or only a torso with intestines flowing out, a bloody mess, a terrible sight. It was truly a great catastrophe. (April 26th)

### Tragic Situation of Japanese Bombing of Ningbo

More Than 350 Shops Destroyed; Nearly 500 Men, Women, Children, and Elderly Killed and Wounded; Losses of Property in the City Amount to Five or Six Million

Ningbo Correspondence: At 8:35 AM on April 28th, seven Japanese planes were spotted over Longshan Mountain. At about 9:00 AM, they invaded the airspace of Ningbo City, circling several times and scattering leaflets containing Wang Jingwei's two declarations. Then, they dispersed and wantonly bombed the newly built Ling Bridge, continuously dropping ten explosive bombs and four incendiary bombs. The locations where the bombs fell were: One bomb landed on the bridge surface of Ling Bridge, two bombs landed at the mouth of Yaoxing Street on the west side, three bombs landed on Binjiang Road (i.e., Banbian Street), three bombs landed in the Jiang River at Banbian Street and Datoutou, one bomb landed at the Huai'an Lane entrance of Ling Bridge Road, one bomb landed on Shiyi Zhen Juan, two bombs landed on Haohe Street, one bomb landed in front of the vegetable market on Ling Bridge Road, two incendiary bombs and one explosive bomb landed at the junction of Tingdong Houtang Road (i.e., the east side of Ling Bridge), and one bomb landed on Yanwu Street. A large fire broke out on both sides of Ling Bridge at one point, and it took four hours to extinguish. More than 150 shops from the Houtang Cold Storage Company behind the Temple of the Queen of Heaven to the Ling Bridge Road vegetable market and the Banbian Street area were completely destroyed. The biggest losses were the German Cold Storage Company, the German Xin Shihua Silk Shop, the Xintiankuan Silk Shop, and the Siming Bank Office. Five fishing boats parked on Banbian Street were destroyed, two were lost, and three were damaged. Four shops at the intersection of Houtang Road and Baizhang Road were burned. Six shops at the intersection of Zhongjie Street were bombed. Nineteen houses were destroyed and damaged on Yanwu Street. A large hole was blown into the bridge surface of Ling Bridge. More than 120 men, women, children, and elderly people were killed, and more than 270 were injured. They were taken to the Central Huamei, Renji, Tiansheng, Puren, and other hospitals by various rescue organizations. The highest military and political officials in the county supervised the rescue work in the disaster area while the Japanese planes were soaring. Shops and residents in the urban area were evacuated overnight. Ningbo, the commercial port of eastern Zhejiang, suddenly became a dead city. According to statistics, the losses in this bombing amounted to five or six million yuan. The essence of the city was almost completely destroyed. It is difficult to hope for recovery without three or five years of construction.

### Price Controls in Sichuan Province

Chongqing Establishes Assessment Committee

Chongqing Airmail: Prosperous commercial areas in Sichuan Province, such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Zigong, and the counties of Wanxian, Yibin, Luxian, and Leshan, have developed significantly since the war of resistance. The prices of various goods have increased more than before the war of resistance, some even rising two or three times or four or five times or more. Daily necessities have soared even more. For example, a tube of toothpaste that sold for only one dime and four or five cents before the war now costs six dimes and five cents. The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently stated that although the high prices of goods are slightly affected by transportation difficulties and foreign exchange relations, there are also unscrupulous merchants hoarding and manipulating prices, making a fortune from the "national crisis." If price controls are not implemented, the national economy and the people's livelihood will both suffer. Moreover, during the war of resistance, efforts should be made to stabilize the rear area. In addition to providing relief to factories and increasing production, the Sichuan Provincial Government was instructed to order all commercially developed counties and cities to organize price assessment committees to consider local conditions and formulate measures. All agricultural, mining, industrial, and commercial goods related to people's livelihoods are to be assessed uniformly.

Since receiving the telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Chongqing Municipal Government also received a hand-written instruction from Chairman Chiang to limit the high prices of goods in the city and adjust the supply and demand of daily necessities. Based on the "Measures for Assessing Prices and Eliminating Speculation and Manipulation in Extraordinary Times," the Chongqing Municipal Price Assessment Committee was established. The Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting of all parties on April 21 to discuss and determine the scope and principles of the assessment. On the afternoon of the 25th, at 3:00 PM, the inaugural meeting of the Price Assessment Committee was held at the Social Affairs Bureau. More than twenty representatives from various agencies attended. The following resolutions were made: Regarding the goods that should be assessed in the city, in addition to the pre-war and post-war prices of newspapers, cotton yarn, white sugar, indanthrene cloth, and sheepskin, which have already been investigated, it has now been decided to investigate piece goods, grain, cotton yarn, Chinese and Western medicines, leather, shoes, and socks, and submit them for approval before assessment. It was decided to hold regular meetings every week. Each industry association was ordered to register the existing whole goods separately and complete the process by the 15th of next month.

### Youth Organizations Issue Declaration Commemorating Youth Day Pledging to Promote the Spirit of the May Fourth Revolution All Days of Life Are Years to Serve the Country

Today is the 20th anniversary of the May Fourth Student Movement. The National Government has decreed that it is National Youth Day. Youth organizations in the city have issued a declaration, listing four key points, and swearing to the elders of the country to serve the country with all their strength. Excerpts are as follows:

### Key Points of the Declaration

(1) Our nation's youth have always been the most radical, enthusiastic, and sincere vanguard in China's national revolutionary movement. Recalling the revolutionary spirit of those years, which was unyielding and unbending, is not only an unprecedented page in Chinese history, but also greatly enhanced the political awareness and national consciousness of our nation's people. Thereafter, from the end of the political movement, more in-depth efforts were made to promote the new culture movement. Due to the widespread planting of revolutionary seeds, China's revolutionary tide, like the Qiantang River's angry tide, surged endlessly. Maintaining and promoting the revolutionary spirit of the May Fourth era is what our nation's youth must strive for every morning and evening and dare not slack off in the slightest. (2) During this period of resistance and nation-building, the difficulties and sufferings encountered by our nation are unprecedented in the history of our country for more than four thousand years. The heavy responsibilities borne by our nation's youth are self-evident. In the early stages of the war of resistance, we have already done our best to fulfill our national duties, but after careful examination, there are many areas where we cannot be complacent. Today, as the later stages of the war of resistance are rapidly unfolding, we must exert all our knowledge and abilities to die for the country. (3) The General Mobilization Outline for National Spirit and its implementation measures promulgated by our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, are the only weapons to win the final victory. Only when all the people of the country are united under the common goal of national supremacy, military victory first, and concentrated will and strength can we restore our land. Our nation's youth must respond to the call of the leader, earnestly implement the various items indicated in the outline. Even if this city becomes an isolated island and the environment is extremely harsh, the spirit of our city's youth will increase due to the adversity of the environment. It must be known that the May Fourth spirit was forged under the iron hooves of the warlords. (4) We firmly believe that there are two basic conditions for obtaining the final victory: first, absolutely support the supreme leader; second, absolutely support the national policy of resistance. Only then can the aggressors be completely defeated. Therefore, our nation's youth must do their best to reject Wang Ni Zhaoming and his cohorts, so that there will never be a day when national traitors exist on Chinese soil. (5) Today, as our city's youth fervently commemorate Youth Day, we solemnly swear to our respected elders in the country with sincerity. All days of life for our city's youth are years to serve the country. We swear to concentrate the unified will and strength, listen to the government's transfer and the leader's command, and sacrifice everything and fight to the end for the cause of resistance and nation-building.

Telegram to Chairman Chiang

All members of the National Salvation Youth League in this city have decided to hold a national public oath today (the 4th), and send a telegram to Chairman Chiang to pay their respects. The original telegram reads: Chongqing Chiang Chairman Jun Jian, the May Fourth Memorial is to have my ambitious youth can not bear to sit idly by my nation's been bullied, and with the greatest determination and perseverance launched in the history of national revolution occupies the greatest glory of the national salvation movement, the members of the League, a youth's duty, the arrow diligence arrow courage, double the efforts, value this second phase of the war began, the spirit is heavier than material, I choose here youth revolution memorial day, held a national public oath, earnestly implement the spiritual mobilization promulgated by the Central, and the telegram Jun Zuo to pay tribute.

### The German Ship De Ping Arrives This Morning; Ningbo Bombed Again Yesterday

Yesterday morning, five Japanese planes dropped more than ten bombs. The Shanghai-Dinghai line has resumed, but the Dinghai-Ningbo line is still closed. The ship Gao Deng was once out of contact.

From You County, 2nd: At approximately 9:00 AM this morning, five Japanese seaplanes invaded Ningbo airspace from the direction of Longshan and bombed extensively, destroying more than twenty city houses, including the Central Hospital, resulting in over twenty casualties. Simultaneously, three Japanese warships shelled the Chinese side outside Zhenhai port with more than ten rounds.

The Italian merchant ship De Ping, belonging to the Chinese-Italian Company, was hired by the Ningbo Association on the first of this month to transport a large quantity of medical supplies, doctors, and nurses to Ningbo for emergency relief. On the morning of the second, it arrived seven miles outside Zhenhai port at the place of Qilishi. However, encountering Japanese warships shelling Zhenhai port, it could not enter. Upon receiving the news, the Ningbo Association telegraphed for it to turn back. The ship left Qilishi at 10:00 PM the night before and returned to Shanghai. It entered the Wusong port at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Japanese soldiers boarded for inspection, which was completed at 6:00 PM. It could have entered the Huangpu River, but due to the evening curfew, it could not enter and had to wait until 6:00 AM this morning to arrive at the dock. At 8:00 PM last night, the Ningbo Association sent a telegram to the ship to express their appreciation. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To Mr. Mu Zixiang and all the doctors and nurses, as the waters are under curfew tonight, it is not convenient to come ashore. We will send someone to meet you at the dock tomorrow morning. First, we send our gratitude. Ningbo Association, Yu Hede, etc., respectfully bow."

Ningbo City Was Bombed Again Yesterday

After being bombed by Japanese planes on the 18th of last month, Ningbo was bombed again on the first of this month. The deaths, injuries, and damage were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Unexpectedly, at 10:10 AM yesterday morning, Ningbo was bombed again. At that time, five Japanese planes dropped more than ten bombs. The Central Hospital on County Front Street and the building next to the Money Industry Association on Jianchuan Street were bombed. Details of deaths, injuries, and damage are not yet reported in Shanghai.

Yin County Reports on the Bombing Disaster

Regarding the bombing situation on the 28th of last month and the 1st of this month, Yin County Magistrate Chen Baolin reported to the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, saying, "To the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, we received your telegram. We are deeply grateful for your concern for your hometown. Upon investigation, the bombing of Ningbo has resulted in more than 130 deaths, more than 110 serious injuries, and more than 100 minor injuries. People who fell into the water or were buried in the fire field and rubble are still being excavated. More than 1,000 houses and 14 civilian boats of various sizes were destroyed. The eastern part was bombed again in the areas of Jiangdong Dajiaochang, Xinhetou, Hui Street, Da Daijia Lane, Baizhang Street, and Lingqiao Men and Jiuru Lane. More than 40 people died, more than 100 were injured, and more than 1,100 houses were destroyed. Special report, Chen Baolin, Winter."

Also, the General Affairs Office of the Shanghai YMCA sent a letter saying, "Regarding the current receipt of a telegram from a certain country in Ningbo reporting the bombing situation in Jiangdong on the 2nd, it is estimated that 1,000 street houses were destroyed in the bustling market of the Lingqiao area in Jiangdong, more than 500 people were killed or injured, and the loss was several million. The YMCA is safe and has been providing rescue. Please forward this information to all the newspapers. Special report."

People of Ningbo Donate to Relief Efforts

Since the bombing of Ningbo, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, at the request of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, decided to raise funds to help the bombed compatriots. After the news spread, people from Ningbo in Shanghai have been donating automatically, sending money to the association in an endless stream, amounting to several thousand yuan. The association has entrusted the Siming, Dalai, Huizhong, Hengli four banks, Fuyuan and Jianchang two money shops to collect the donations. An announcement will be published to widely encourage donations from compatriots.

The Shanghai-Dinghai Route Resumes Yesterday

After the Shanghai-Dinghai route was approved to resume by the Ningbo Defense Command, the German Far East Company's Hana ship, originally scheduled to depart directly from Shanghai to Dinghai at 4:00 PM on the 2nd, temporarily decided to postpone the sailing for the sake of caution due to the detention of the German ship De Ping by Japanese warships. It was decided to postpone the sailing and wait for De Ping to be released and return to Shanghai before sailing to Dinghai. Therefore, the ship schedule advertisement was changed to 4:00 PM on the 3rd. By 5:00 PM last night, as there was news of De Ping's release, and passengers had boarded and goods had been loaded, the ship departed directly from Shanghai to Dinghai at 5:00 PM. It was not inspected when passing through Songkou. It is heard that Haifu will sail to Dinghai tomorrow.

The Dinghai-Ningbo Route is Temporarily Cut Off

The foreign ships approved by the Ningbo Defense Command to sail the Ningbo-Dinghai route include the Portuguese Zhengde Company's Libao ship, the German Schneider Shipping Company's Tianbao ship, and the German Rulin Shipping Company's Gao Deng ship. Now, the Libao and Tianbao ships have been detained by Japanese warships and forced to sail to Shanghai, where they are docked at the Yangshupu buoy. Negotiations are underway by the Portuguese and German consuls but have not yet been resolved.

Gao Deng Once Lost Contact

Yesterday, it was widely rumored that the Gao Deng ship of the German Rulin Shipping Department was detained by Japanese warships on the Chuanshan waters. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the ship's radio communication with the Shanghai company had indeed been cut off from 4:00 PM on the 30th of last month. However, from this morning, it has been able to communicate normally. The ship is now docked in Dinghai, and the Ningbo-Dinghai line is temporarily suspended. When the ship's radio could not communicate with Shanghai, it was clearly a time when it lost freedom of movement.

### Pudong Residents Understand the Greater Good

Puppet Regime Forced to Promote Anti-British Sentiment; Residents Show No Sympathy

The puppet "North District (i.e., Gaoqiao) District Office" in Pudong was forced to summon laborers from various townships such as Gaomiao, Dongjing, and Laoshusha to hold an anti-British rally at the Gaoqiao Public Stadium on Labor Day, distributing various anti-British slogans and pamphlets. At 2:00 PM, more than a hundred laborers gathered, parading through the streets in formation. At the head was a white cloth banner with the nine characters "New Shanghai Labor Anti-British Rally." Following were people holding five-colored flags and small flags with anti-British slogans. After the parade, the group dispersed. However, businesses, due to the extremely harmonious Sino-British relations, showed no sympathy.

### Tomorrow, May 5th, All Sectors Fly Flags in Commemoration; Announcements from Both Concessions' Taxpayer Associations

Tomorrow, May 5th, is the anniversary of the Kuomintang's appointment of a Grand President.

The Public Concession and the French Concession will handle this in the same way. It is heard that the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession issued an announcement yesterday, listing the eight days of the year agreed upon for flying flags and informing citizens. May 5th is one of the eight days. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession also issued a separate announcement yesterday, informing that flags will be flown tomorrow to show unity.

### Rice Industry to Meet Tomorrow; Exert Efforts to Maintain Price Limits

More Than 600,000 Bags of Rice in Stock; There is No Need to Loosen Price Limits

After the Shanghai Rice Industry Group Valuation Committee resolved to persuade and unblock sources to prevent prices from exceeding the limits, they sent a letter to the Bean and Rice Industry Association yesterday, asking them to properly plan strategies to balance market prices. The Market Management Committee yesterday invited various firms and wholesalers to urge them to strictly maintain price limits and prohibit under-the-table transactions. The Bean and Rice Industry Association announced that a joint meeting of various rice industry groups would be held tomorrow. Details are recorded below:

Request for Prompt and Proper Planning

The Rice Industry Group Valuation Committee sent a letter to the Bean and Rice Industry Association yesterday, stating, "Regarding the recent under-the-table transactions of high-quality japonica rice exceeding the price limits, and the price of Yangjian rice far exceeding the limits, how to find a way to suppress it is an urgent matter. Therefore, the committee convened a meeting on May 1st, which agreed that although the source of rice and inventory have decreased recently, leading to rising prices, there are still more than 610,000 bags of rice in stock for the most recent two crops, and there is no immediate cause for panic. All wholesalers should be earnestly urged to consider the food needs of the people and exert efforts to unblock sources, and must not exceed the price limits. At the same time, the Bean and Rice Industry Association should promptly convene a meeting of rice industry groups to jointly discuss proper strategies to balance market prices, etc. The resolution is recorded. A special letter is sent to inform you, and we hope you will follow the instructions. We are eagerly awaiting your response."

Joint Meeting of Rice Groups

The Bean and Rice Industry Association sent a letter to the Changshu Rice Association, Nanbang Association, Rice Sales Industry, Rice Shop Industry, Rice Milling Industry, and Shanghai Northern Rice Wholesalers Association, stating, "Our association is scheduled to convene a joint meeting of representatives of various rice industry groups at 3:00 PM on May 5th (Friday) at the Grain Exchange, 2nd floor, 15 Avenue Edward VII to jointly discuss important matters. We hope that the representatives of your association will attend the meeting at that time. We are eagerly awaiting your response." Also, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with a rice industry leader yesterday, who said that as of the end of April, the two concessions in Shanghai had 611,153 bags of rice in stock, which is a decrease of 41,303 bags compared to the previous period, but the inventory is still sufficient, and there is no shortage of food for the people. There is no need to immediately loosen the price limits.

Unblock Sources, Prohibit Under-the-Table Transactions

In view of the fact that high-quality japonica rice and Yangjian rice have exceeded the price limits and under-the-table transactions have occurred in the market, the Bean and Rice Industry Market Management Committee invited various firms and wholesalers to a meeting at the market at 11:00 AM yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Management Committee member Fu Qian'geng, who urged them to strictly maintain the price limits (No. 1 white rice is 14 yuan per stone, others are priced accordingly), prohibit under-the-table transactions in the market, and make every effort to unblock sources to maintain the food supply for Shanghai citizens. The meeting adjourned at around 12:00 PM.

### Commemorating the Jinan Incident; All Sectors Support National Policy

City Residents Strengthen Their Determination to Resist Japan to Achieve Victory, National Reconstruction, and Avenge National Humiliation

Yesterday was the 11th anniversary of the Jinan Incident. All sectors of the city solemnly commemorated the event. All sectors believed that the Jinan Incident was caused by the invaders hindering the progress of revolutionary forces eleven years ago and maintaining the last tool of aggression, the remnants of the warlords. Fortunately, the Supreme Leader took a detour north and still completed the unification cause. Now, the sacred war of resistance is actively unfolding, and the realization of national liberation and national independence is not far away. All citizens of the city unanimously support the national policy and strengthen their will to resist Japan to achieve victory, national reconstruction, and avenge national humiliation.

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that today (the 3rd), in several shops and residences in the Public Concession, the Chinese national flag was flown in commemoration of the Jinan Incident. The police asked them to take it down, and most complied. This is because the authorities and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association have agreed on eight days for flying the national flag, and today is not one of them. There were many flags flown on Đồng Bằng Sông Cửu Long Road, including eight women's underwear shops that refused to take down the national flag, saying that they would fly the national flag every year on this day. Seeing that they would not comply, the police summoned a large number of reserve police officers, a red security vehicle, and three trucks of White Russian merchants. After arriving, they circled the area and then told the eight shop owners to take down the flags again. The shop owners refused again, and the police took them to the Chengdu Road Police Station. There was no conflict at the time. At the police station, the eight shop owners were told that they would be released if they took down the national flags. Soon, the flags were taken down, and the security vehicle and White Russian merchants also left. The turmoil subsided.

### Japanese Freighter Suddenly Catches Fire

Severe Internal Damage

The China Press reported that yesterday (the 2nd), the Japanese-language Continental News reported that the Japanese Yusen Kaisha freighter Loshan Maru (phonetic translation) caught fire and burned severely while docked at the Yangshupu wharf on Sunday evening. It is believed that the fire was caused by Chinese arson. The fire was discovered on board at 7:00 PM that evening, but the swift action of the crew prevented the fire from spreading and was soon extinguished. At around 11:30 PM that night, another fire broke out. Although the fire brigade tried their best to control it, the fire had spread throughout the ship. It was not until after 1:00 AM that the fire could be controlled. The ship was burned and damaged and could not sail. The Japanese military police and consular police immediately began investigating, believing that the person who set the fire was on board. The ship employed a large number of Chinese sailors, and the fire broke out while it was docked, indicating that it was the work of an arsonist.

### Japanese Troops Attacking Tangwan Disarmed and Expelled

Songhu Guerrillas Inflict Heavy Casualties on Japanese Troops; Japanese Troops on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line Rush to Build Fortifications

More than 30 Japanese Marines, traveling from the Shanghai-Minhang Road through Beiqiao, intended to advance to Tangwan to attack the guerrillas. However, the guerrillas had received a tip and were scattered in civilian houses in time. The Japanese soldiers arrived at the town, and not seeing any signs of the guerrillas, they suspected that the guerrillas had been intimidated by the "Imperial Army" and had fled to other places. So they marched in single file, and when they reached the vicinity of Tangwan Elementary School, the guerrillas surrounded them from all sides. The Japanese soldiers realized they had been ambushed, but it was too late. They struggled to resist, but they were no match and had to abandon their weapons and ask for help. The guerrillas confiscated the Japanese troops' weapons and then expelled the unarmed Japanese, without killing them.

Songhu Area Guerrilla News of Victory

At about 1:00 PM on the 25th of this month, Japanese troops used four motorboats to transport more than 80 soldiers, who landed from the direction of Yaqian to a certain place where the Independent Brigade of the Songhu Guerrillas was stationed. When they approached the brigade headquarters, the brigade had already heard the sound of the motorboats and deployed in the trenches. A firefight immediately broke out. The gunfire was intense. During the heat of the battle, two more motorboats arrived, loaded with ammunition and more than 60 Japanese soldiers, who landed behind the brigade and attacked from both sides. The brigade was forced to move north to avoid the attack, and they re-engaged in a bloody battle at a certain place east of Langxia. The first and second companies were responsible for the frontal attack, while the brigade commander personally led the third company to encircle the enemy from behind. At this time, the 45th Brigade of the National Army also sent a team to provide support, boosting morale. Regardless of officers or soldiers, they all charged forward fearlessly. The shouts of killing shook the sky, and the bullets rained down. More than 40 Japanese soldiers were killed on the spot, and 60 to 70 were seriously injured. Just as they were about to completely annihilate the remaining Japanese troops, more than 300 Japanese reinforcements arrived on eight motorboats and broke into the third company's position. It was getting late, and the enemy outnumbered them. They defended their positions and stopped advancing. The Japanese also dared not engage in a prolonged battle, and they collected the corpses and wounded soldiers, loaded four motorboats, and retreated towards Jinshan. According to reports, this battle lasted for more than ten miles and lasted for four hours. The guerrillas only lost one soldier and two were wounded. The soldier who died, Shao Weiwen, initially suffered a gunshot wound to the chest. He filled the wound with bean leaves and continued to fight. He engaged in hand-to-hand combat again, killing one Japanese soldier before sacrificing himself heroically under the bayonet due to exhaustion. The Japanese troops, with a force of four to five hundred, fled and even snatched civilian clothes from farmers to escape.

### Japanese Build Fortifications on Shanghai-Nanjing Line

Japanese troops along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway have been building defensive fortifications and rushing to build gun emplacements in recent days, which is extremely tense. They are also building a large-scale blockhouse and an anti-aircraft platform each in the Qingyang Port area. Yesterday (the 2nd), three military trucks carrying sand, gravel, and steel bars were transported from the North Station, along with a team of Japanese engineering soldiers, to rush the construction. According to the Japanese side, the project will be completed in one month.

### China Industrial Association Collects National Product Samples

Prepared to Send to Southeast Asia for Exhibition to Promote Domestic Products

After receiving the notification from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to collect national product samples for exhibition in Southeast Asia, the China Industrial Association sent letters to various manufacturers asking them to send national product samples with prices marked to the association for shipment to Southeast Asia for exhibition. To understand the facts, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited the person in charge of the association and asked about everything. The reply was as follows: The decision to send national products abroad for exhibition was at the request of the Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce in Malaya to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. From the association's perspective, it should do its best to fulfill its long-standing responsibility to promote domestic products. Since the announcement was issued, the response to send national products to the association for shipment to Southeast Asia for exhibition has been enthusiastic. However, the association's review of the submitted goods is very strict to ensure that compatriots who love domestic products do not feel disappointed.

### Difficult for Puppet "Huaxing Bank" Currency to Be at Par with Legal Tender; Difficult to Obtain Unlimited Foreign Exchange; Observations from Foreign Bankers

The Continental News reported that yesterday (the 2nd), it was rumored that the currency issued by the Huaxing Commercial Bank, which is managed by puppets, is circulating in large quantities in Hongkou and Yangshupu. No traces of it have been found south of the Suzhou River. Foreign bankers still believe that it will not be easy to implement the bank's guarantee to keep the new currency at half the price of the legal tender and to obtain unlimited foreign exchange with the new currency.

A well-known foreign banker told the reporter on Sunday that the only way for the new bank to keep its promise is to implement export restrictions similar to those implemented by the Japanese authorities in North China. Yesterday, another banker said that it should be known that Shanghai's situation is very different from that of North China. It is doubtful that the Japanese side will implement export restrictions here. He also believes that the currency issued by the bank, no matter how strong its support may be imagined at present, has no chance of success under these circumstances. Also, a Chinese banker said that they know nothing about the Huaxing Bank except what they have seen in the newspapers. Also, The China Times reported that the Huaxing Commercial Bank, jointly established by China, Japan, and Taiwan, was established here on Sunday, but its currency is still piled up in the basement.

Last night (the 2nd), the bank personnel ridiculed the claim in a certain local English-language evening newspaper yesterday that the new "Hongkou" currency had appeared. They claimed that the bank has not yet started business, so there is no currency circulating outside. It is scheduled to open on May 10th or slightly later.

### Why Are Tax Stamps Not Affixed to Business Invoices?

Should Pay Attention to Correction When Shopping; A Case Reported by a Newspaper Reader

Our newspaper received a letter last night from a reader in this city, Shi Zhihua, the content of which is the disclosure of a minor dispute arising from the omission of tax stamps on the invoice issued by a store, Jiyuan. On the surface, it seems to be a trivial matter, but the content is related to the entire national tax revenue. Therefore, we will disclose the letter below and hope that all business people will pay attention to it.

Dear Editor,

Your time is extremely valuable, and I originally did not want to disturb you. However, in my opinion, this matter is also very important, so I have to bother you. Please take a minute to listen to me. At 6:10 PM on the first of this month, I went to a record company to purchase a record for a friend, priced at 2 yuan and 75 cents. I paid with a 5 yuan bill. When they gave me back 2 yuan and 25 cents, there was no invoice. I was told that all stores selling goods for more than one yuan must affix tax stamps and have invoices, and since I was purchasing for a friend, it was even more appropriate to have an invoice. When I asked for one, the clerk said, "Do you still want an invoice?" It was clear that they intended to omit the tax stamps. Because I insisted, they soon handed me an invoice, but instead of tax stamps, there was a blue square stamp with the words "Tax stamps should be affixed, the post office has stopped selling them, and there is no way to pay." Since the tax stamps had already been issued, I immediately asked why they were still using this stamp instead of affixing tax stamps. The clerk claimed that they could not purchase them. I argued with them, but they unreasonably defended themselves. Later, they even threatened me, saying, "We can't buy tax stamps. If you can buy them, you can go buy them with me." I insisted on not buying the goods unless tax stamps were affixed, and I asked them to refund the money, but they refused. Therefore, the argument lasted for a long time. Two other customers also joined the protest and argued with them. More and more people gathered. Later, another clerk affixed a two-cent tax stamp to the invoice and handed it to me. Only then did the commotion subside. All the other customers left empty-handed. I believe that tax stamps are a merchant's obligation to pay taxes to the country. Although sales in this city were once suspended, they have long since been issued. I believe that this merchant intentionally omitted tax stamps. Although it is only two cents, I am afraid that this is not the only case, nor is it the only store. This matter concerns national tax revenue. Although one or two cents is a small amount, but small amounts add up to a large amount. If all the stores in this city follow suit, the national loss would be considerable. Moreover, omitting tax stamps harms the country, and this matter is easy to do and greatly benefits the country. I hope that all my compatriots will fulfill their duty to supervise the omission of tax stamps, so that the national tax revenue can be maintained in its integrity. I also hope that people in the community will punish those who omit tax stamps to warn others. I hope that your newspaper will not hesitate to use a corner of the newspaper to announce this matter so that everyone will know. Your newspaper is serving the nation, and I can also do my duty as a citizen. I would like to extend my respects to the editor of the Shen Bao. Sincerely, Citizen Shi Zhihua.

### Puppet "Ministry of Communications" Attempts to Seize Old Assets of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; Warehouses and Wharves of Weihai Company Also Included in the Property Rights to Be Taken Over

The puppet "Ministry of Communications" of the "Reform Government" hopes to revive the former state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and has asked the Japanese to hand over the wharves and warehouses of the former China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in various ports along the Yangtze River to the puppet "Ministry" for takeover. In its plan, the four properties of the Shanghai warehouse wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company that the National Government sold to the American Weihai Company, namely the China Merchants Xin Zhan in Pudong, the China Merchants Hua Zhan in Pudong, the China Merchants Zhong Zhan in Hongkou, and the China Merchants Bei Zhan, are also included in the takeover. It is heard that the Weihai Company, which holds the property rights of the four Zhan, firmly opposes this. If the puppet "Ministry" tries to implement this plan, it will ask the U.S. diplomatic mission to negotiate with the Japanese side again to maintain its legitimate rights and interests.

### Puppet "Pacification Team" Suddenly Revolts

Between Zhitang and Zhitang; Japanese Officers Escorting the Team Were All Executed

In recent days, there have been incidents of interception of military and commercial vehicles along the Xihu Highway, causing panic and anxiety among the Japanese. In order to "pacify" the Chinese troops along the line, on the first of this month, the Japanese sent a truck from Changshu, fully loaded with more than 20 members of the puppet "Pacification Team," escorted by two Japanese officers. First, they drove to Zhitang Station to search, but the local Chinese troops had already heard the news and had fled far away, so they gained nothing. They then drove the original vehicle to Zhitang Station. Unexpectedly, when they drove to the vicinity of Mengjiang Temple (between Zhitang and Zhitang), the puppet "Pacification Team" revolted, executing the two Japanese officers escorting the team and setting fire to the truck. Afterwards, they stripped off the yellow uniforms they were wearing, took their guns, and dispersed into the countryside. Later, the chief of the Zhitang Japanese garrison received the news and immediately sent a large team of Japanese troops to the scene of the incident to search, but to no avail. After this incident, the Japanese have been monitoring the puppet troops very closely, fearing that a similar incident will happen again.

### Pig Industry Yesterday Sent Letter to Concession Authorities Requesting Relief

Appealing to Chinese Directors for Assistance, Restricting Market Prices to Maintain People's Food Supply

Over a thousand head of fresh pigs from the fresh pig industry were seized by the "Livestock Market" of Hongkou on May 1st. After serious negotiations with the shipping company by various pig businesses in the capacity of consignees, and a statement reserving the right to claim damages, the shipping company and others negotiated with the pseudo-market. It was only in the afternoon of the 2nd that all the pigs were returned, but they still wanted to add a fee of several jiao and fen per pig, which was resolutely rejected by the consignee pig businesses.

Yesterday (May 2nd) at approximately 5 p.m., eight train cars of fresh pigs, totaling more than 400 head, were seized again by the Hongkou "Livestock Market". They are currently considering countermeasures and plan to file a complaint with a certain authority if necessary.

The Japanese Chairman of the "Market," Matsuda Masuyoshi, and the Chinese Chairman, Shen Bingquan, also known as Sun Hongyang, had the association send representatives Gu Baoheng and others to visit Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, and others on the afternoon of May 1st, requesting assistance.

The requests were agreed to.

The association also sent letters to the Public Concession's Municipal Council Bureau and the French Concession's Public Works Bureau on the 2nd. The letter stated approximately: "Our association is the central hub of the fresh pig industry in the entire city, with two buying and selling markets located in the Public Concession and the French Concession. Since the establishment of the 'Shanghai Livestock Market' in Hongkou, it has repeatedly taken away the goods arriving from various businesses in our industry.

For example, on May 1st, over 200 pigs transported on the Yunhai Maru belonging to the Shanghai branch of the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, over 600 pigs transported on the Danhai Maru belonging to the Jie Xing Company, and over 300 pigs transported on the Mai Maru were all taken away arbitrarily by the 'Shanghai Livestock Market' upon arrival in Shanghai. Moreover, according to what the market proclaimed,

they would continue to take away fresh pigs transported by Japanese ships in the future. Investigating, freedom of business is a common practice in any country, and monopolizing commerce is prohibited by law. If the fresh pig industry can be arbitrarily monopolized, then other industries will also be manipulated. This kind of behavior,

carried to the extreme,

will cause the entire economic structure of Shanghai to collapse, or cause a major crisis in the security of the Shanghai Concessions. For the sake of respecting administrative authority and maintaining the food supply for millions of people within the Concession, your bureau should

seriously consider

finding a way to provide relief and seek benefits for the public, lest unlawful attempts grow unchecked. This would not only be fortunate for our industry alone. Therefore, we earnestly state the facts and request you to promptly take measures to maintain commercial stability."

### Foreign Ships Maintain Shanghai-Fujian Shipping Routes

Recently, Japanese warships and planes have been constantly harassing and bombing the coastal areas of Zhejiang, causing the closure of various ports and greatly impacting the shipping industry. Regarding Fuzhou, although ships cannot conveniently enter the Min River, foreign ships still anchor at Mawei, loading and unloading cargo. However, the export of cargo barges within the river must wait until there are no Japanese aircraft bombing before they can sail out. It is now known that

the Italian Company's

Gran Patara, two ships, is waiting in the port of Fuzhou to load timber. Quanzhou and Xiamen are also still peaceful. At 11 a.m. today, the Taikoo Company's Xinjiang ship departed from Shanghai for Shantou, also stopping at Quanzhou, carrying a large amount of bamboo and grain. Furthermore,

Jardine Matheson's

Lishun ship is currently in Xinghua and will return to Shanghai from Fuzhou within days, arriving in port on the 6th. It is scheduled to depart again from this city directly to Fuzhou and Xinghua on the 9th. However, during this time of war, changes in navigation may occur at any time, and merchants will be notified accordingly.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Encourages Industrial Technology

Three Patent Approvals Granted

The Ministry of Economic Affairs announced the decision of the Industrial Technology Encouragement Review Committee, Numbers 23, 24, and 25, as follows: Zhang Yanxiang's invention of the Wanwan Secret Code Converter and Code Plate is granted a patent for five years. Hao Hengfu's invention of the formula and manufacturing method for green salt essence is granted a patent for five years. Hao Hengfu's invention of the formula and manufacturing method for green is granted a patent for five years. Detailed explanations will be published in the Shanghai Commercial Monthly Report, Volume 15, Number 5, according to the ministry's order.

### Demanding the Curbing of Anti-Japanese Sentiment, Japanese Side Issues Strong Declaration

Two Declarations Not Sent to Concession Authorities, Only Announced at a Press Briefing

The Continental Daily reported that the Japanese military press department announced two strong-worded declarations at a press briefing last night (May 2nd), demanding that the Public Concession Municipal Council and the French Concession immediately take steps to curb all anti-Japanese activities in the two districts. A spokesperson for the press department stated that these two declarations had not been formally delivered to the Municipal Council, but it was hoped that they would draw the Municipal Council's attention to the declarations.

Regarding this Declaration,

a reporter asked why, since this matter concerned the authorities of the two concessions, it was not delivered to them but instead announced at a press briefing. The spokesperson replied that protests had been repeatedly lodged with the Municipal Council, and there was nothing new. The declaration was issued now to draw public attention to the situation. The spokesperson mentioned the five demands made by the pseudo-"Mayor" to the Municipal Council and the Consular Body.

The spokesperson further stated that the Japanese authorities believed that recognizing the "Great Way Government" would not undermine the neutrality of the Concessions. The spokesperson also mentioned the government assassination cases in the two concessions. When asked whether some assassination cases had occurred in the "Great Way" area, the spokesperson replied that this was merely a proper excuse. He also stated that it was difficult for the Municipal Council to implement Japanese demands, but the two concessions were

a base for anti-Japanese activities

and must be curbed immediately. When asked whether the Japanese demand to curb anti-Japanese activities in the two concessions also applied to foreigners with anti-Japanese tendencies, the spokesperson replied that if there were such foreigners, they must also be curbed. When asked what action the Japanese side planned to take if the two concessions could not satisfy the Japanese demands, the spokesperson replied that there was no need to discuss that at present.

### Spanish Residents Celebrate Franco's Victory

The North-China Daily News reported that many Spanish residents in Shanghai attended Mass at the church at 235 Manshi Road yesterday morning (May 2nd) to celebrate General Franco's final victory and the liberation of Spain. The Falange Española of Shanghai supported Franco's form of government. Members of the society wore red and blue uniforms and went to the Italian Consulate General. When the chairman of the Spanish residents association, Le Beo, arrived at the consulate, thirty-nine members greeted him with a fascist salute and played the Spanish national anthem. According to a member of the Falange Española, the society was informally established seven months ago and only announced its official establishment yesterday.

### Car Accident Tragedy, Western Police Officer Can Now Speak, Police Personnel Have Visited to Interview, Report Drafted Based on Account

The North-China Daily News reported regarding the car accident that occurred on the night of April 24th, Li Li and a Japanese sentry died, Li Li's wife was injured, and Western police officer Wimsett of the Public Concession Police Force was also seriously injured. The doctor attending to Wimsett allowed police personnel investigating the case to interview Wimsett for a period yesterday morning (May 2nd). Wimsett is now able to speak. The press has not been able to obtain

the content of what was said.

The documents regarding the circumstances of the accident have been drafted and will now be supplemented with Wimsett's account. Due to Wimsett's weakness, those who visited him at the Country Hospital yesterday only stayed in his ward for a few minutes. It is heard that personnel from the British Consulate are scheduled to visit Wimsett today or tomorrow. It is also believed that Japanese authorities will go to the British Consulate today to request a representative from the Consulate to accompany them to visit Wimsett, so they can hear his account. Yesterday, at the Japanese press briefing,

various reporters

asked about the incident after the accident where Police Officer Samson of the police department was slapped in the face by a Japanese major in the waiting room of the Country Hospital. They asked whether the protest lodged by the Municipal Council had been received. The spokesperson replied that the Japanese Consulate had received the dispatch, but it had not yet been forwarded and was currently under investigation by the Japanese naval warfare team officer. At the end of the press briefing, the spokesperson gave each reporter a written statement containing the Japanese side's views on the accident and the slapping incident.

### British Warship HMS Cricket Arrives in Shanghai, Carrying a Large Number of Foreign Nationals from Hankou

Will be Decommissioned with HMS Mantis Upon Arrival, New British River Gunboats Will Arrive in China One After Another

The English-language Ta Mei Evening News reported that the British warship HMS Cricket, carrying foreign nationals from Hankou, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today (May 3rd) for its final voyage, as the river gunboat will soon be sold and decommissioned along with its sister ship HMS Mantis. The two new British warships replacing them are HMS Grasshopper and HMS Dragonfly, which have already set sail. Two more new river gunboats will sail to China next year, and two older ships will be decommissioned. HMS Cricket arrived with HMS Scorpion, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Holt, from

Hankou,

carrying thirty-nine foreign nationals from Hankou. They were previously unable to leave Hankou due to Japanese restrictions on the movement of third-country ships and people. HMS Scorpion is scheduled to arrive here at 2:30 p.m. HMS Cricket towed a British naval oil barge and had to detach the barge's cable upon arriving at Wusong and enter the port slightly later. HMS Scorpion arrived in China several months ago to replace HMS Bee and serve as the flagship of the Yangtze River Fleet.

Novel Design

Although its net tonnage is lighter than that of HMS Bee, it carries more crew members, partly because it carries smaller guns. HMS Dragonfly and HMS Grasshopper are quite similar to HMS Scorpion. HMS Mosquito and HMS Locust are currently under construction in the United Kingdom and will be commissioned next year and also join the Yangtze River Fleet. The existing "Insect-class" river gunboats will eventually be replaced by "New Insect-class" warships. HMS Mantis is currently docked in the Yangtze River and will soon make its final voyage, as the crew of the ship and HMS Cricket are scheduled

to go to Hong Kong

and then take over the crew of the two new warships HMS Grasshopper and HMS Dragonfly, which will sail from the United Kingdom to Hong Kong. The two ships will arrive in Shanghai after exercises in Hong Kong, scheduled for June 14th or 15th. The "Insect-class" ships served in the Near East during World War I, weighing 625 tons each and carrying two 6-inch guns. They were subsequently

transferred to China

to serve on the Yangtze River and the Pearl River. Every summer, they could sail up the river to Chongqing. There were a total of eleven "Insect-class" warships, eight of which were stationed on the Yangtze River and three near Guangzhou. The British Yangtze River Fleet also had several smaller gunboats, all named after wild birds. British river gunboats are very numerous and are therefore commonly seen in Shanghai.

### National Music Broadcasting Concert Scheduled Broadcast

20th and 21st of May, Held at the Continental Radio Station

The joint broadcasting and fundraising event by national music groups in the city held its third preparatory meeting a few days ago. It was resolved to continue promoting fundraising and soliciting enthusiastic participation from national music groups throughout the city. Therefore, internal work has been quite tense. It was also resolved to hold a broadcast on May 20th and 21st (Saturday and Sunday) at the Continental Radio Station. All national music groups that have already participated should promptly submit their music names to the association's office at 28 Dongpu Stone Road for compilation. As for the donation book method, it will be carried out according to the amateur group. Donations are now being distributed to benefit the disaster victims, which is truly no small matter.

### Truth About the House Collapse Tragedy on Luxiangyuan Road, Nanshi, Bride Marrying While Pregnant, Adulterer Secretly Causing Trouble

At 2:05 p.m. the day before yesterday, a house collapse tragedy occurred at the Fuxingyuan Restaurant at 146 and 148 Luxiangyuan Road in the Nanshi refugee area, while a wedding ceremony was being held for Yongren Weng Axiao and Yu Yunxia. Sixty-two people were killed or injured. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Here is a supplementary account of the cause of the tragedy, as learned through investigation.

Usually Romantic and Restless

Yu Yunxia is 17 years old and from Suzhou. Her parents loved her dearly from a young age and did not restrain her. Pampered and indulged, she developed a romantic nature and had affairs with several men, gaining notoriety in the neighborhood. Recently, because she was pregnant, she could not stay at home for long, so she quickly chose a date to marry Weng Axiao. Who knew that her former adulterer would learn of the auspicious wedding date?

Harboring Jealousy and Secretly Sawing Through Beams

According to the North District Fire Brigade's post-incident investigation, the house was not old and there was no need to demolish it. It was found through investigation that someone had secretly sawed through the tail beam beforehand to vent their anger, causing the house to collapse and crush many people. After the bride was crushed to death, she was dug out from the rubble and found to be pregnant. The groom, Weng Axiao, was injured and sent to the Qinglian Street Glass Guild Muslim Hospital for treatment by the Fire Brigade. It is reported that Weng was injured in the leg and his eyeballs had popped out, and his injuries were quite serious.

Detained a Bean Curd Peddler

After the incident, the Nanshi pseudo-police bureau attached great importance to the case and thoroughly investigated the truth. From the occurrence of the tragedy the day before yesterday until the time of writing today, the pseudo-police bureau has detained a bean curd peddler who is related to the case and is currently investigating.

### Abusing a Maidservant, Six Months Imprisonment

Lin Jiangshi, a Guangdong woman residing at 347 Tongfu Road, is 30 years old. Her husband runs a lace company, selling various Western-style laces. Last October, Lin Jiangshi's mother, Jiang Cai, obtained Jiang Qiuju, the eleven-year-old daughter of her fellow villager Chen Chufeng, as a maidservant. However, Lin Jiangshi was quite violent and would frequently

mistreat Qiuju, mercilessly whipping her with a rattan cane over two feet long, causing Qiuju to be covered in bruises and suffering beyond words. On the night of the 29th, she took the opportunity to escape, wandering along the streets of Xinzha Road, and was discovered by a policeman who took her to the police station and sent her to Guangren Hospital. An examination revealed that her back, arms, buttocks, and legs all had

blue and purple bruises, fresh marks from the rattan cane.

testify to the beatings. When questioned, Lin Jiangshi admitted to beating the girl for stealing money. She hired lawyer Liu Yuhao to defend her. Judge Fu sentenced Lin Jiangshi to six months imprisonment for abusing a girl under the age of sixteen, and the girl was sent to the Jiliang Institute.

However, the thugs, seeing that they could not achieve their goal, took out a pistol and fired a shot at the Vietnamese constable, hitting his abdomen, causing a gaping wound and causing him to fall to the ground in a pool of blood. The thugs then took the opportunity to escape. Afterwards, a Westerner passing by discovered the situation and reported it to the police station. The injured Vietnamese constable was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is heard that his injuries were very serious. The police station sent detectives to investigate and arrest the escaped criminals and bring them to justice. The English-language Ta Mei Evening News reported that an armed foreign thug shot and seriously injured Vietnamese Constable Niu Yingshangchu (translator) No. 53 of the French Concession last night (May 1st), which is a shocking development in the history of armed crime in Shanghai.

### Russian Empress Ship Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong; Guide Frauds Tourists; Siblings Scammed During Tour; Main Suspect Go Hau Taken to Court for Interrogation

A Chinese woman with American citizenship, Si San, recently accompanied her brother on the Russian Empress ship from Hong Kong, intending to go to Canada. The day before yesterday, the ship passed through Shanghai and, as usual, stopped for several days. Many passengers disembarked to sightsee, and He San also went ashore with her brother at the new customs wharf. Unexpectedly, six Cantonese people, including Huang Guoqia, who specialized in leading tours (commonly known as "pilots"), immediately approached them,

Offering to be guides, and took He and her brother to the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road for lunch. However, as it was full, they went to the Dasanyuan Restaurant across the street. While they were eating, Huang and the others began to boast that a famous Chinese medicine, "Liushen Wan," was very popular in Europe and America. Now that they were passing through Shanghai, they should buy some. After the meal, the guides led them to the Qianyuan Tai Pharmacy at No. 6, Lane 7, Sanjun Road, Yunnan Road, to buy Liushen Wan. At that time, Huang and the others even pretended to be passengers on the same ship, also going to Canada, and claimed that they had forgotten to bring cash ashore. Therefore, they asked for a loan of 28 yuan in legal tender. He San only gave them 14 yuan. Unexpectedly, the other five people, after receiving the money, made excuses and left first, leaving only Huang Guoqia to accompany them on their tour. When they returned to the new customs wharf, Huang also disappeared, and they realized they had been scammed. They immediately reported to the Laozha Police Station, which instructed detective Huang Yingjie to investigate. Huang Guoqia was arrested on the 2nd of this month when he returned to the Qianyuan Tai Pharmacy. He was taken to the police station, where he confessed the names of the five fugitives: Situ Bao, Zhao Hua, Zhong Chang, Liu Shi, and Wu Youkai. He was ordered to be detained and yesterday was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jian Xunjiu presented the above situation and requested an adjournment to continue the investigation. Subsequently, the complainant, Ms. He San, submitted a case statement detailing the fraud. When questioned, the defendant Huang Guoqia claimed that his uncle had an office in Shanghai. The other day he took the opportunity to buy Liushen Wan to give to his uncle, who would then reimburse him and return the money to Ms. He. However, because his uncle was not in, he could not return the money and had no intention to deceive her. Judge Meng examined the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained for seven days for further interrogation.

### Shanghai Bar Association Rectifies Discipline

The Shanghai Bar Association, in order to rectify the discipline of lawyers, resolved through the Standing Committee to notify all members to maintain discipline. The original notification is recorded below: (1) Respected Sirs, Lawyers are specially authorized by the state to represent or defend people in lawsuits, holding one of the three important positions in the judiciary. Therefore, they cannot be compared to other professions. Any slight deviation from normal conduct may invite criticism. Although all professions can advertise themselves, lawyers should not openly solicit business. Over the years, this Association has notified all members that they must not publish advertisements soliciting business in newspapers or similar advertisements in other places. Even when representing clients to publish announcements in newspapers, it should be limited to legal matters and should not involve unrelated matters. Now, fearing that this may be forgotten over time, we are sending this special letter to all colleagues, hoping you will pay attention to maintain discipline. With utmost anticipation, we wish you legal success. (2) Respected Sirs, Lawyers are specially authorized by national laws to perform their duties. Their acceptance of clients' entrustment to handle or defend civil and criminal lawsuits is also based on the law, in order to fulfill their sacred mission. However, it has recently become common in newspapers for clients to publish announcements thanking the lawyers after the conclusion of lawsuits. This is truly ignorant of common sense. Fearing that this may become a habit and affect the discipline of lawyers, we are sending this special letter to all members for your information, hoping you will explain this to your clients, advise them not to publish thanks in newspapers again, and jointly reverse this decline. With best wishes for your health, The Standing Committee of the Shanghai Bar Association.

For twenty years, we have been conscientious and dedicated to serving the local community. Beyond that, we have no background of any kind. Furthermore, the disaster yesterday occurred when our Association dispatched the second truck, not during a collision on the way back. Now, to be labeled "fake" for no reason is truly damaging to our Association's reputation. We hereby request a correction and hope it will be published. Sincerely, Caojiadu Fire Brigade, a business organization, May 3, 28th.

### Robbers Loot Restaurant Cash Register, Open Fire to Resist Arrest, One Robber Shot and Captured, Re-Interrogated After Recovery

Li Hong, a native of Ningbo, 34 years old, together with Wang Agen, who is still at large, went to the Ouya Garden Cantonese late-night snack shop at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession to eat dim sum at 11:00 PM on the night of September 10th of last year. After eating their fill, Li and Wang approached the counter, claiming to be paying the bill. They pulled out a handgun, threatening them not to make a sound. They then pulled open the cash register drawer and snatched more than ten yuan in large and small legal tender that the shop had taken in sales. They fled out the door, and the shop employees shouted for them to be arrested. As Li and Wang fled northwest along Guangxi Road and Yunnan Road towards the border with the Sutongbang, Chinese constables Tang Yucai (No. 192) and Wang Jinting (No. 2079) of the Public Concession Police heard the alarm and helped chase after them. Unexpectedly, Li pulled out his handgun and fired a shot at constable No. 192 to resist arrest. Fortunately, he missed. Constable No. 192 immediately returned fire, firing six or seven shots, hitting Li in the arm with six bullets. Despite this, he still ran away with all his might, running a circle through the British Concession and returning to the French Concession, fleeing into the Taiyuanfang lane at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII West and Zilaihuo Street. Due to the extreme pain in his wound, he could not support himself and fell next to a garbage can. The French Police were notified and sent detectives to arrest Li, seize the handgun, and take him to the police station. The police chief found that Li's gunshot wounds were very serious and ordered him to be sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, he sent the transfer order to the Second Special Court to postpone the trial until Li had recovered. Wang Agen escaped from the crowd at that time and has not been apprehended. Now that Li has fully recovered, he was brought back for investigation by the French Police and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday morning. Judge Liao Yuan interrogated him, and the security office lawyer Gu Shouxi presented the case, prosecuting him on three charges: attempted murder, robbery, and carrying military firearms. Subsequently, the victim and constables No. 192 and No. 2079 successively testified to the robbery and resistance to arrest. Constable No. 192 also stated that the defendant aimed the gun at his chest when resisting arrest. Fortunately, he missed, but it was still intentional homicide. When questioned, the defendant Li Hong confessed that he lived in Nanshi. He picked up the handgun on the road after the National Army withdrew the year before last. Because he had no money to use, he intended to entrust Wang Agen to sell the gun. Wang invited him to eat dim sum, but unexpectedly, after eating, Wang had no money, and neither did he, so they robbed the place on the spur of the moment. When he fired the gun, he intended to scare the constables so they wouldn't chase him, and had no intention of killing anyone. The court examined the confession, ordered the arguments to be opened, declared the conclusion, and scheduled the sentencing for the 10th. The defendant was returned to custody.

### The Relationship Between Marriage and Physical Health

Marriage is indeed a major event in life. Although some say: "Marriage will increase the burden," or "Marriage is the tomb of love," who can transcend this stage after reaching adulthood? People cannot be superheroes, so who would give up the happiness they are entitled to in life? Large numbers of men and women are bound to embark on the path of marriage, and this is the reason.

If marriage is truly for the pursuit of happiness, a vigorous and healthy man and a beautiful and graceful woman, once married, will naturally spend sweet days in an atmosphere of love, have children, and build a happy family. Happiness will be boundless. Furthermore, with the adjustment and encouragement of love, their lives will inevitably be fulfilling. Happiness and progress are interconnected, leading to a cheerful mind and a healthy body. Life becomes more optimistic. Therefore, taking big steps on the journey of life, marching forward with courage, will bring great benefits in both academic and career pursuits. Thus, marriage for a healthy man truly marks the beginning of his happy life.

However, if a man has engaged in masturbation and nocturnal emissions in his youth, or has indulged in excessive sexual activity after marriage, or has suffered from overwork, resulting in problems with his sexual function such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, dissipated energy, infertility, or incomplete development, then even if he marries, he will not only fail to find happiness but will only increase his troubles. Because he has failed to fulfill his wife's passion and has wasted her youth, how can she not feel grief and indignation when the flowers are in full bloom, filled with sorrow and resentment! If she has a stronger character, she may even engage in extramarital affairs or file for divorce from her husband. Is this not something we often hear about? Therefore, for men who are physically weak, I advise them to postpone marriage until they have cured their hidden ailments. Because not only will there be no happiness to speak of, but their health will likely deteriorate further. Many weak men become prematurely senile after marriage, or even die young due to illness, becoming short-lived ghosts. All illnesses should be treated thoroughly and as early as possible, especially the aforementioned conditions. If treatment is delayed, it will inevitably lead to "losing the big because of the small." However, it is never too late to mend the fold after the sheep have been lost. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the best and most effective treatment for the aforementioned conditions is to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproduction Element). This agent can promote sperm production, nourish the kidneys, invigorate the brain and blood, and nourish the nerves. With continuous use, mild cases can be cured in about a week, and severe cases can recover to full health in two or three weeks. However, those with nocturnal emissions must also take "Himi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (Himi Tuo Shi Sperm-Consolidating Tablets) to strengthen the sperm gate and stop emissions, thus treating both the symptoms and the root cause, with even faster results. If patients can come to my clinic for electrotherapy, injections, surgery, and other scientific treatments, a cure can be guaranteed.

Beauty and Health

### Beautiful Breasts and Happiness

—Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

What kind of woman in the world is the happiest? This is undoubtedly a healthy and beautiful girl, or a mother with clever children. A healthy and beautiful girl is welcomed everywhere, as if she is surrounded by a divine light. A mother with clever children, building a happy family, is like the owner of a beautiful and grand garden. Although she works hard, she has boundless joy!

But how can they achieve such happiness? According to physiological research, it is entirely due to the health of the ovaries and the vigor of metabolism. Because when the ovaries are healthy, the breasts will develop well, and the buttocks will also be exceptionally developed. Thus, the most mysterious curves of a woman can be formed. Due to vigorous metabolism, a large number of new cells are produced in the skin, muscles, blood, and other parts. Therefore, the skin becomes fair and tender, the muscles become plump, and the cheeks naturally become rosy. Such women are the flowers of the era, and their happiness is naturally boundless! However, if past experiences such as chest binding, masturbation, irregular menstruation, vaginal discharge, weakness, or severe illnesses have damaged the ovaries, affecting breast development, then not only will they lose their attractive beauty, but they will also be disliked by men, and there will be no happiness! The only remedy is to immediately take the ovarian preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" for women. It can nourish the ovaries, stimulate metabolism, regulate menstruation, eliminate uterine diseases, and promote pregnancy function overnight. With continued use, not only can withered breasts gradually become high and elastic, but also haggard faces can become delicate and charming, enhancing beauty and health.

### The Causes and Consequences of Nocturnal Emissions

—Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Masturbation is the worst bad habit that is unsupported by good people. Eight or nine out of ten cases of nocturnal emissions are caused by masturbation. In addition, excessive use of the brain or nerve stimulation, which causes it to lose its normal function, can also cause nocturnal emissions. In short, the reason why young people have nocturnal emissions, apart from suffering from gonorrhea and inflammation of the sperm gate, is mostly a sign of neurasthenia.

Semen in the human body functions to promote developmental function, stimulate metabolism, and nourish the nerves. If excessive seminal fluid is lost due to frequent nocturnal emissions, the brain, spinal cord, sex organs, and nerves will be damaged. Symptoms such as brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, dissipated energy, and infertility will inevitably follow. At the same time, the developmental function will also be hindered, and metabolism will be reduced, resulting in incomplete development, short stature, and small genitalia like a child. There are also those who become sallow and emaciated, mentally depressed, and prematurely senile. Such young people are often sick and in pain. How can they compete with others in academics and careers? Even in the indispensable marital life, they will not be able to comfort their wives and will be hated by them! The family will suffer, happiness will be lost, life will be painful, the future will be hopeless, or even the lifespan will be shortened!

There are many methods for treating nocturnal emissions, but the most effective and targeted one is "Himi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (Himi Tuo Shi Sperm-Consolidating Tablets). This medicine can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, reduce nightmares, and promote restful sleep, so nocturnal emissions will naturally be cured. It must also be taken in conjunction with the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. With continued use, full health will surely be restored soon. If patients can come to my clinic for electrotherapy, injections, surgery, and other scientific treatments, a cure can be guaranteed.

Leukorrhea Forum

### Why Leukorrhea Threatens Reproduction

Leukorrhea that threatens reproduction has now been resolved.

Those who are infertile due to gonorrhea are all overjoyed.

People generally believe that gonorrhea occurs in the urethra. Why does it have such a big impact on reproduction? Many think this is alarmist talk. But this is not the case. Human reproduction must have the following conditions: (1) An organ for producing sperm. (2) A source for nourishing sperm. If the organ that produces sperm is damaged, it will lose its function of producing sperm, and therefore sperm cannot be produced. A sperm is like a tadpole, swimming in prostatic fluid, which is the sustenance for the sperm to live. And the organ that produces sperm is the testicle. In the complications of gonorrhea, orchitis and prostatitis are the most common. Prostatitis is more likely to occur than orchitis. These two symptoms each have their specific effects. Prostatitis often becomes prostatic leakage if left untreated. A white liquid will escape from the urethral opening when straining during bowel movements, wasting the prostatic fluid. As for orchitis, if it occurs on one side, there is still one testicle that can produce sperm. If both sides are inflamed, reproduction will be hopeless. With my decades of experience, I use German "Xi Shi Blood Serum" and Le Zhi's prostate massage method, using the correct treatment for the symptoms. Furthermore, with German "Lv Lin Ping Liu" electrotherapy, penetrating the lesions to eradicate gonorrhea bacteria, all symptoms that threaten reproductive ability such as prostatitis and orchitis can be quickly treated, and reproductive function can be restored. I am confident and dare to guarantee it.

### China Youth Society - Message to Youth Commemorating May Fourth

China Student Service - Initiates Ten No's Campaign

The China Youth Society was established on April 30th. To commemorate the May Fourth Movement today, it has issued a message to youth. The original text is very long, and excerpts are provided below. Dear youth, the May Fourth Movement is a glorious historical event created by us students and youth. From the May Fourth Movement onward, the entire Chinese ideological movement and cultural movement underwent a epoch-making transformation. The May Fourth Movement not only directly sanctioned the traitorous conspiracies of feudal warlords, but also nurtured a new enlightenment movement in Chinese youth thought. This is the beginning of the Chinese youth movement and the most tragic scene of Chinese youth participating in the revolutionary movement. Today, as we commemorate the May Fourth Movement in this tense stage of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, we feel its significance is even more profound. Because China's revolutionary movement has entered a new stage, from the anti-feudal stage to the anti-aggression stage. The participation of Chinese youth in the revolutionary movement is naturally closely coordinated with the wheels of this era. However, we must not forget the May Fourth Movement. We must carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement and create an even greater and more glorious commemoration. We must grasp reality and ignite the revolutionary fire in the tide of national revolution.

China Student Service Issues Declaration

To commemorate the May Fourth Movement, the China Student Service has launched a "Ten No's" campaign. The text of its declaration is excerpted below. Shanghai, in its corner, is often called an "isolated island." Hundreds of thousands of college, middle, and elementary school students are in a noisy and disruptive environment. Jazz music is played in dance halls, and salacious books are displayed in stores. What a grand spectacle! Furthermore, grotesque copies are shown on the screen, and sweet letters are transmitted by postal workers. As a result, some wear clean clothes and wander the streets, while others have dirty bedding and steal and hide other people's belongings. Some, driven by patriotic zeal, sneak into the interior to work, while others are exploited and pretend to join certain groups to diligently investigate various situations. In this extraordinary period, these are almost the daily lives of many students. The habits are deeply ingrained and have a great impact. Over time, they will cause endless harm. At this time of national survival, when the call to mobilize is high, frontline soldiers are entering and exiting the rain of bullets and are working hard to save the country. How can young students be drunk with life and dreaming of death, go astray, and continue to do this? The consequences are unimaginable in the future. An organization should be formed urgently to lead the people and be a model for the people. The Service has always been dedicated to serving the student community, silently observing the current social situation, and deeply knowing the advantages and disadvantages. It has launched the "Ten No's" student movement, hoping that students from various schools will abide by it, vigorously change their bad habits, do practical work, set an example, respect themselves, and make revolution the foundation of their achievements, and make loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace the principles of their lives. The country is fortunate, the nation is fortunate.

Also, the Shanghai Student Community Spiritual Mobilization Association, the Shanghai Student Union, and the Suzhou Middle School Association, among others, also issued a letter to all students in Shanghai yesterday to commemorate May Fourth.

### Overview of National Higher Education Funding (II)

National Treasury subsidies to provincial and private vocational schools above the associate degree level were previously limited to a small number of schools approved on a case-by-case basis. Starting in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), a special fund for subsidies to private vocational schools above the associate degree level was established. (Three points were noted during distribution and allocation: (1) Subsidies for practical subjects such as science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine should account for at least 70% of the total special fund. (2) 70% of the subsidies for each school should be used to expand equipment, and the remainder should be used to add faculty for special subjects. (3) Each subsidy is limited to one year, and those who violate the regulations at the time of approval may have their subsidies suspended mid-way.) The total amount of the special fund was initially set at 760,000 yuan per year, and was increased to 1.22 million yuan in the 26th year of the Republic (1937). Provincial schools were added to the allocation, and the fund was renamed the Special Fund for Subsidies to Provincial and Private Vocational Schools Above the Associate Degree Level. It was also decided to increase this special fund annually, and no longer give subsidies to a portion of schools based on special approvals. During the War of Resistance, the fund was reduced for distribution. 910,000 yuan was actually distributed in the 26th year of the Republic (1937). In the first half of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), 416,500 yuan was distributed based on the actual distribution in the first half of the year. From the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) to the present, the number of subsidized schools has increased from 22 to 46. The relocation expenses for the schools that moved to the rear were mostly paid by the schools themselves from their original budgets. However, a small number of schools that had to relocate over long distances had budgets that were too stretched. After special approval, relocation fees were subsidized, totaling 370,000 yuan from the 26th year of the Republic (1937) to the present. Teachers from schools in the war zone who lost their jobs were also given living expenses by the ministry to enable them to engage in editing and research work, at around 70,000 yuan per month. In addition, students from the war zone were distributed to schools in the interior for borrowing studies and were given travel expenses and allowances. After admission, they were also given living loans, totaling around 80,000 yuan per month.

Boxer Indemnity Funds

(1) The standard for the allocation of British Boxer Indemnity funds divides the educational and cultural undertakings that should be carried out into five categories. Category B subsidizes higher education research institutions, with a special emphasis on agriculture, engineering, medicine, and science, accounting for 35% of the total amount. In addition to subsidizing academic institutions and organizations, the subsidies for public and private vocational schools above the associate degree level were 275,000 yuan in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), 295,000 yuan in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), 755,000 yuan in the 25th year of the Republic (1936), and 1,305,000 yuan in the 26th year of the Republic (1937). (500,000 yuan of this amount was temporarily decided after the start of the War of Resistance to establish two temporary universities in the southwest and northwest, namely the current Southwest Associated University and Northwest Associated University.) In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the amount was 685,000 yuan. (2) After the return of the American Boxer Indemnity funds, all of it was used for the development of education and culture. A portion of it was used for the expenses of Tsinghua University (including the school's expenses, overseas students, and university funds), and the other portion was kept and allocated by the Board of Directors of the China Education and Culture Foundation. A portion was set aside as a permanent fund, and the portion used to subsidize vocational schools above the associate degree level, in addition to the funds the society directly allocated for scientific professorships to universities in various regions and the establishment of joint lectureships with designated universities, was used to subsidize the construction, equipment, research, and maintenance expenses of various schools, amounting to 200,000 to 300,000 yuan per year. (3) According to the Sino-French Boxer Indemnity Agreement, the returned funds were used for Sino-French educational undertakings and were kept and allocated by the Sino-French Education Foundation Committee. The vocational schools above the associate degree level that received regular subsidies included Sino-French University, Sino-French Institute of Technology, Aurora University, and Tianjin Business College.

Funding Adjustments

The 26th year of the Republic (1937) saw a tightening of educational funding. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), there were restrictions on continuing the funding methods of the previous year. In addition to the above, there were other funding adjustments worth mentioning: (1) 40% of the original budgets of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University were transferred to form the Southwest Associated University. (2) 40% of the original budgets of Peiping University, Peiping Normal University, and Peiyang Engineering College were also transferred to form the Northwest Associated University. (3) 50% of the original budgets of the Peiping and Hangzhou Art Schools were transferred to form the National Art College. (4) The budgets of Shanghai Business College, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Jinan University, and the Republican College of Sino-French University were each reduced by 60% of their original budgets. (5) The budget of Tongji University was reduced by 80% of its original budget. (6) A portion of the funds from the Northwest Associated University budget allocated for the engineering and agricultural colleges was transferred to partially fund the Northwest Institute of Engineering and Agriculture, as well as the relocation expenses of Northeast University. (7) A portion of the funds from the Northeast University budget allocated for the engineering college was transferred to partially fund the Northwest Institute of Engineering. (8) All the funds of the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Vocational School were transferred to partially fund the Northwest Agricultural College. (End)

### Shanghai People's Dinner

— Zhang Mengzhao

Shanghai people's breakfast is very casual and perfunctory, while Shanghai people's dinner is very particular and meticulous. Here, I can explain the reasons for this.

We know that the prosperity of Shanghai is not in the daytime, but in the evening. Once the lights are on, the neon lights illuminate half the sky, and the restaurants, dance halls, brothels, theaters, and hostels are filled with music and laughter, making you intoxicated and immersed! So every time at dinner time, people call their friends and go to restaurants. Those who are more economical eat snacks (although they are snacks, they cost no less than two or three yuan). Those who are more lavish eat a full banquet and large dishes. During the banquet, they guess punches, issue commands, drink heartily, and often when they are in high spirits, they call for a局to enjoy flowers, sing a song on the spot, or invite prostitutes to sing songs such as "Peach Blossom River," "Swallow Song," and "When Will You Come Again." The voices of the singers are so pleasant that they make you feel relaxed and yearning. But as the saying goes, "There is no banquet in the world that does not end." How much does such an evening cost? More than tens of gold? However, the quasi-Shanghai people who are surviving in the isolated island paradise, or the fake Shanghai people who have temporarily joined the group, are actually enjoying this and never tire of it.

A large part of this wasteful and extravagant dinner is the temptation of sound, color, dogs, and horses, which makes you lose your mind and have to go to the restaurant for a drink. This is vastly different from the simple foods such as bread, rice balls, or plain noodles that are stuffed into your stomach in the morning! Although it cannot be said that all Shanghai people are like this, at least it is not a small number. I can say with certainty that the boiling and crowded atmosphere in the restaurants, buildings, and large dining rooms is definitely not a formal banquet with proper things for every family!

Generally speaking in society: In general companies, firms, shops, and factories and other industrial and commercial institutions, every dinner is a full table, with rice, porridge, and rich dishes. Mansions and families are also like this. Only ordinary middle-class families eat some burnt rice or white porridge, with a plate of peanuts or preserved eggs, oily bamboo shoots, bright shrimp, etc. as side dishes, which is already very delicious. Why bother with chicken and meat every night, indulging in the pleasure of your mouth? So every night when I go home, a plate of vegetables and a plate of beans, or a lettuce, a bamboo shoot, a salted egg, to go with two bowls of thin porridge, I feel very satisfied and happy. Those who don't even have thin porridge to eat are the ones who are really suffering!

### Artificial Silk

— Lu Lishi

The weather is changing from late spring to early summer! We just need to look at the people walking on the street, and they have changed into light and floating clothes. Following the gentle breeze of early summer, "wearers feel comfortable and happy." This is the power of silk. Chinese people like to wear clothes made of silk, but they will not make the manufacture of silk universally developed, nor will they reduce the price of silk. Therefore, this treasure of "artificial silk" has risen to prominence. Now, I'll talk about "artificial silk":

"Artificial silk" has only recently taken a turn for the better, but it was born in 1925. At first, no one paid attention to this thing, thinking that "artificial silk" was a toy, at most displayed in exhibitions for people to watch. Who knew that "artificial silk" itself had made progress - that is, "artificial silk" can be popularized among the people. The annual consumption actually exceeds that of silk by more than four times?

The raw material that makes up "artificial silk" is the leftover cotton from spinning. The cotton fiber is soaked in nitric acid to cause a nitration reaction, resulting in a kind of nitrated woven element. Then, it is dissolved in a certain solution to become a colloid, and then it flows out through a fine hole like a rice sieve, and it solidifies into a glossy fiber. After sorting, it becomes the so-called artificial silk, which is called Rayon in English.

Artificial silk has a wide range of uses, and like real silk, it is good for making fabrics such as satin and silk. Although clothes made of it are not as soft as silk, they are also very crisp. Items such as silk stockings, ties, and handkerchiefs can all be made of "artificial silk." The price is several times cheaper than real silk, so more and more people are using "artificial silk."

Recently, three new types of "artificial silk" have been invented: one called "water-resistant silk," one called "wrinkle-resistant silk," and one called "stain-resistant silk." They are really ingenious. Clothes made of "water-resistant silk" are good to wear as raincoats on rainy days. When water encounters this "water-resistant silk," it retreats as if it has encountered fire. Clothes made of "wrinkle-resistant silk" do not need to be ironed with an electric iron. When you compress the "wrinkle-resistant silk" into a small piece, it is an extremely smooth piece of clothing when you release it. "Stain-resistant silk" has a special point: its surface seems to be covered with a layer of glass. Wearing it is a good thing, you just need to shake it gently, and all the dirt will be immediately expelled and wiped out.

"Artificial silk" is constantly improving, and it may overthrow silk in the future. But all the products of this "artificial silk" are imported goods. We should pay attention. It is best to wear silk made of domestic silk to recover our rights.

### Train on the Desert (Part 2)

— Teadrinker

Not only that, but also because there are other means of transportation such as donkeys, mules, oxen, and horses in the customs during the day, traveling back and forth. If camels were to travel during the day, it would cause traffic jams on the road. Because every time a camel travels, there are hundreds or thousands, or at least dozens of them. If they were to go east on this road, then other vehicles coming west would not be able to pass. This is because the long snake formation they form is not easy to dodge.

Camels, as animals, do not walk very fast, but they have long-lasting patience. They can march all day long without fear in the midst of wind and snow. This spirit of not being afraid of hardship is not only inferior to other animals, but even we humans, who are the most sensitive and are called the supreme animals, cannot match them.

In the camel's procession, one out of every five camels must have a large bell hanging around its neck, and at least one person out of every ten must be sitting on its back. The last camel must have a particularly large bell around its neck that is also particularly loud. This is the pressure bell for pulling the camels. In other words, the camel pullers ride on the backs of the camels at night and don't have to worry about anything else, as long as they hear the loud iron bell behind them ringing, there will be no mistakes.

Speaking of this, I can't help but say that camels are too stupid. As the saying goes: "Hemp rope pulls a camel." In their procession, each camel is strung with a hemp rope through its nostrils and tied to the back of another camel's camel frame. Because the hemp rope is extremely loose and thin, it is most likely to break. If the rope breaks, it will not stop and follow the team forward; so there must be a person at the front pulling them forward, so the ordinary camel driver is called: "Camel Puller".

It is said that the reason why thin hemp ropes are used to pull them is because camels do not recognize strangers. If there are any thieves or robbers who want to rob them, the camels will spit camel dung to resist strangers, so the hemp rope will break immediately. The camel pullers hear the sound of the bell is wrong, they will know that there is an accident and add to it.

### Pei Long (Carrying Basket)

— He Lisan

The term "Pei Long (Carrying Basket)": seems very obscure. What exactly is this thing? I'm afraid most readers will be confused. Now let me introduce it to you. According to "Pei Long (Carrying Basket)" is a specialty of Zhuji, eastern Zhejiang, and is used as a means of transportation. The object is shaped like a festive box, but the box is made of wood, while this is woven from bamboo or rattan, making an oval shape, like a cradle for a child to sleep in. There is a backrest on top. This object is placed on a wooden frame, and a very long carrying pole is passed through the top of the frame. Two people carry it. When walking, the porters in front and behind make strange cries. People sit inside, just like sitting on a bed, with a cotton quilt underneath as a cushion. This is what is called Pei Long (Carrying Basket). Many households in that area have this thing as a means of transportation for their own families and for welcoming and sending off relatives and friends. When in use, two long-term workers are called to be porters. If there are no long-term workers in their own home, they can be called from neighbors or other places. The wages are very casual, depending on the distance of the journey, but meals must be provided. This kind of travel equipment is rarely seen by people from other provinces. When they see it, they will be deeply surprised, because the shape is very unsightly. Nowadays, rickshaws are popular in the urban areas of the county, and this thing is almost eliminated, but it is still popular in the townships!

Special Notice: Recently, many contributors to various newspapers have automatically transferred their manuscript fees to charity sales donations. Contributors to this publication who wish to participate, please indicate "Charity Sales Donation" at the end of the manuscript, and we will do so accordingly.

Errata: In the April 27th issue of this publication, "The Washing Problem of Clothes," line 12, "shallow iron pot" was mistakenly "shallow", line 20, "add fertilizer to the fields" was missing the word "with", and line 28, "漿衣之上" was mistakenly "用" as "其".

### One Week Economic Menu

— Mrs. Hua Ying

Cabbage is also a very nutritious vegetable, whether it is cooked with meat or vegetarian, it can be said to be suitable for everything, and not only does it occupy an important position in Chinese cuisine, but it is also often used in Western cuisine. The most common vegetarian cooking method is braising. If you are cooking vegetarian delicacies, then you must use cabbage, and all the other ingredients such as gluten, fried dough sticks, bamboo shoot slices, fragrant mushrooms, and fungus are all auxiliary ingredients. As for meat dishes, the most common is to braise it with pork chunks, or stir-fry it with sliced meat and sliced bamboo shoots, without soy sauce, and the taste is very similar to stir-fried cauliflower with sliced meat. There is also a special cooking method, which is what I want to introduce this week, which is cabbage-wrapped meat. Finely chop pork and bamboo shoots together, add soy sauce, mix them together, and make patties. Then, take the washed cabbage leaves, one by one, and wrap a meat patty in each leaf, making it look like a dumpling, and braise it together. It tastes very delicious. If you like to eat beef, you can use beef instead of pork, which is also possible.

Monday: Cabbage with Meat, Yellow Croaker Stewed with Pickled Vegetables, Spinach with Tofu, Bamboo Shoots with Lettuce

Tuesday: Onion Beef, Sweet and Sour Braised Crucian Carp, Fried Dough Sticks with Greens, Stir-fried Bean Sprouts

Wednesday: Dried Vegetables Braised Pork, Shrimp Roe Steamed Eggs, Tofu Shepherd's Purse, Bamboo Shoot Skins with Vermicelli Soup

Thursday: Shepherd's Purse Pork Soup, Vinegar Glazed Large Yellow Croaker, Braised Cabbage, Jellyfish Radish Salad

Friday: Silver Sprouts Stir-fried Pork, Silver Fish Stir-fried Eggs, Fried Dough Sticks with Mustard Greens, Shrimp Roe Stir-fried Gluten

Saturday: Cabbage with Sliced Pork, Pork Stewed with Salted Pomfret, Tofu Lettuce, Pickled Vegetable Soybean Sprouts

Sunday: Curry Meat, Egg Drop Soup, Stir-fried Shepherd's Purse, Stir-fried Radish

### The Relationship Between Housing and Health

— Gu Buwen

Clothing, food, housing, and transportation. If "housing" is lacking, then there is no place to settle down. We toil all day long, running around, all for the sake of clothing and food; but if there is no stable residence, wouldn't that be terrible? In the current deformed prosperity, the so-called paradise of the isolated island, there is a great panic due to the housing problem. Although the second landlords enjoy unexpected benefits by taking advantage of the power of the god of war, it is not a small matter to exploit the fat of the third tenants, but it greatly affects human health and has a great relationship. A small house is occupied by six or seven families, and even the attic is full. As a result, the house is small and there are many people, and the air volume is not enough. There is even less talk of cleanliness, or ventilation is hindered, which affects breathing, or the lack of light causes bacteria to grow. Under these various conditions, it is difficult to have a healthy life, and it greatly harms the activities of the mind and body.

You need to know that the size of the house is very related to health. If the house is not suitable, it will hinder personal hygiene, easily make you feel bored and tired, weaken your body, and lack resistance, so infectious diseases are more likely to spread, and there is a possibility of developing tuberculosis and other diseases. At the same time, the mortality rate of residents will inevitably increase and life expectancy will be reduced, which are all the bad consequences of poor housing.

If we want to have a healthy body, we must pay attention to the hygiene of the house. At least, it should have the following standards:

Spacious Housing

The amount of fresh air we need for health is roughly as follows: Men - 3,600 cubic feet per person per hour. Women - 3,000 cubic feet per person per hour. Children - 2,000 cubic feet per person per hour.

Mixed Family - Average 2,000 cubic feet per person per hour.

From the above figures, we can know that in order to maintain normal breathing and fresh air, we must have a large space. Therefore, the houses where we usually settle down must also be quite spacious in order to maintain clean air and avoid breathing difficulties, resulting in diseases.

Open More Windows

As the Western proverb says: "Where the sun does not reach, the doctor often comes." It can be seen that light is very important for health. Houses with insufficient light are not only prone to nearsightedness, but also cause bacteria to grow, resulting in air pollution. The quality of light in a house depends entirely on the number and position of the windows. If you open more windows, you can not only circulate air, but also allow sunlight to enter, eliminating germs, so the number of windows can be used to judge the quality of the house.

Living Facilities

With spacious houses and more windows, if the living facilities do not meet hygiene standards, it is also difficult to meet the requirements of health. Living should meet hygiene standards, sleep should be on time, as for the facilities, do not pursue modernity, you should need simple applicable. It is common to see general families piling up miscellaneous things, which is most detrimental to hygiene. Allowing yourself to stay up late at night and not getting up until noon, keeping all the windows closed, and having no room that is not dirty, even if you live in a spacious house, it is still too far from the way to health.

Excellent Environment

Houses close to factories, or next to noisy roads, are troubled by soot, dust, and noisy noise all day long. This kind of soot contains harmful substances such as carbon dioxide and sulfurous acid, which is very harmful to the human body. In addition, the noise of the army and horses is unsettling all night, so the mind and body suffer great damage. If you encounter a fierce second landlord or an unruly neighbor, you will suffer great pain in your spirit. Therefore, the living environment should also be carefully selected and carefully considered.

North Faction Actively Trading, Cash Prices Greatly Decreasing then Slightly Recovering

Nearly Breaking Through the 2,100 Yuan Barrier

Yesterday's cash market for "boiled red" (gold bars) remained volatile, generally showing a sharp decline followed by a rebound, depending solely on the level of supply and demand. Initially, Erda Qian Dui Ye (representing the Tianjin Faction) and a certain silver firm (representing wealthy merchants) successively purchased, but because gold firms, silver firm factions, and Qian Dui Ye supplied heavily, resulting in supply exceeding demand, the market trended downward. At 10:00 AM, T-bonds and a certain Qian Dui Ye suddenly released holdings on behalf of the Tianjin Faction, which further unsettled the market, leading to a rush of sellers and a downward price spiral, nearly breaking through the 2,100 yuan barrier. Subsequently, a certain gold firm took advantage of low prices to purchase, and arbitrageurs in the foreign exchange market also became slightly active, coupled with a renewed aggressive advance by the securities faction, leading to a reverse rally. However, the final settlement resulted in a decrease of 11 yuan. There were many twists and turns along the way, but without excessive volatility. It was heard that after closing, the securities faction bid as high as 2,115 or 2,116 yuan to buy, but failed to find counterparties, resulting in no transactions. Overall trading was brisk at 950 taels. Silver jewelry declined by 2 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stable.

"Boiled Red" Declines Another 11 Yuan

Since morning, each bar (ten taels) opened weakly due to vigorous selling by gold firms and silver firm factions. At 9:40 AM, the first transaction saw a gold firm sell 50 taels to a silver firm faction at 2,115 yuan, an opening price 5 yuan lower than the previous close. After the opening, Qian Dui Ye's buying power remained strong, stabilizing the situation. Qian Dui Ye purchased 50 taels from a silver firm faction at 13 yuan, and another 50 taels from a peer at 12 yuan. Subsequently, it purchased another 50 taels from a silver firm faction at 14 yuan. Later, the silver firm faction purchased 50 taels from a gold firm at 15 yuan. After this, a certain Qian Dui Ye and gold firm began to release holdings, and the buying interest waned, leading to a renewed downward trend. A certain Qian Dui Ye sold 100 taels to a peer, pushing the price down by 4 yuan to 11 yuan, and then could not sustain it. A certain gold firm sold 50 taels to a silver firm faction at 09 yuan. At that time, the securities faction also followed suit by selling, further exacerbating the decline. A certain gold firm then purchased 50 taels from a securities faction at 01 yuan, followed by another 50 taels from a silver firm faction at 02 yuan. Qian Dui Ye purchased 50 taels from a silver firm faction at 01 yuan. A certain gold firm purchased another 50 taels from a Qian Dui Ye at 01 yuan, and the silver firm faction also purchased 50 taels from a Qian Dui Ye at the same price. Thereafter, a certain Qian Dui Ye suddenly absorbed holdings on behalf of arbitrageurs, and the price immediately rebounded. A certain Qian Dui Ye purchased 50 taels from a peer, and the price jumped 9 yuan to 10 yuan. Later, due to a larger number of suppliers, the price declined again. Qian Dui Ye traded 90 taels with each other at 06 yuan. The silver firm faction sold 50 taels to a Qian Dui Ye at 05 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, due to a sudden purchase by the securities faction, the underlying trend strengthened. Initially, the securities faction purchased 50 taels from a Qian Dui Ye at 07 yuan, and then purchased another 50 taels from a Qian Dui Ye at 08 yuan. Later, Qian Dui Ye traded 50 taels with each other at 09 yuan. After this, there was still an intention to purchase, but sellers were scarce, leading to an increase to 15 or 16 yuan, but no counterparties were found, so the evening closing price remained at 2,109 yuan, resulting in a net decline of 11 yuan compared to the previous close, with a difference of 14 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold at gold firms was 2,120 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,105 yuan. The spot gold standard was priced 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with no transactions.

Jewelry Gold Marked Down Twice

The price of jewelry gold at silver firms was initially unchanged. However, at 9:45 AM, due to the weak opening of "boiled red," it was marked down by 1 yuan. Later, at 10:20 AM, as "boiled red" fell near the 2,100 yuan barrier, it was marked down by another 1 yuan. After this, no changes were seen. Datong Hang changed to 214 yuan, and Xintong Hang to 212 yuan, with a purchase price of 206 yuan.

British Pure Gold Remains Stable

The 2nd [date missing] London telegraph reports that British pure gold remains stable at £7, 8 shillings, and 6.5 pence per ounce. Consequently, the Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash also remains stable at 1,212.3 yuan. The listed price for customs gold remains flat at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remains unchanged at 1,207.6 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Rebound Slightly

Yesterday, British pure gold remained unchanged. The British-American exchange rate rose by 0.0625. Foreign exchange at the Bund, foreign firms were actively settling accounts, and banks' supply remained smooth. Market prices remained stable, but forward rates were slightly tight. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The opening market price for "boiled red" was weak. A certain Qian Dui Ye suddenly absorbed holdings near noon, which stopped the downward trend. Buying interest increased in the afternoon, resulting in a much greater decline than the previous evening. Foreign currency, British and American gold pounds, was in great demand. Domestic "boiled red" was weak, and the price of US and British pounds declined slightly. The demand for British and American gold bills was strong, and the market price declined slightly due to a slight easing of forward rates. Singapore bills and rupee bills were slightly oversupplied, and prices declined again. The supply and demand for Hong Kong bills remained stable. There were no transactions at the guild. Yesterday, British gold bills declined by 1 fen, American pounds declined by 1 jiao, American bills declined by 1 fen and several li, Singapore bills declined by 5 li, and rupee bills declined by 2 fen. Other currencies remained unchanged.

### "Counterfeit Currency" Continues to Fall by Half a Yuan

Tianjin, 3rd [date missing] telegraph reports that the unofficial market for counterfeit "Joint Reserve Bank Notes" this morning, compared with the opening on the morning of the 2nd [date missing], continued to depreciate by 5 jiao. 100 yuan in legal tender could buy 134.5 yuan in "Joint Reserve Bank Notes," meaning that 1 yuan in "Joint Reserve Bank Notes" was worth only 7 jiao and 3.5 fen in legal tender.

### Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rates Stable

—Tianjin-Shanghai Exchange Down Half a Yuan—

Hong Kong, 3rd [date missing] telegraph reports that the British-American exchange rate this morning, at the opening, was the same as the closing price on the afternoon of the 2nd [date missing]. At 9:55 AM, the Shanghai exchange rate fell by 1 jiao and 2.5 li, priced at 179.375 yuan. At 11:15 AM, the Shanghai exchange rate rebounded by 1 jiao and 2.5 li, priced at 179.5 yuan. As of 11:30 AM, the British-American exchange rate remained unchanged. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The opening market prices this morning are listed below:

British Exchange: 1 shilling, 2 pence, 78125

American Exchange: 28.8125 yuan

Shanghai Exchange: 179.5 yuan

(The Shanghai Exchange rate is the amount in Shanghai legal tender equivalent to 100 Hong Kong dollars)

Tianjin, 3rd [date missing] telegraph reports that the exchange rate, compared with the previous day, British Exchange shrunk by 0.03125, American Exchange shrunk by 0.0625, Shanghai Exchange fell by 5 jiao. The opening market prices this morning are listed below:

American Exchange: 15.9375 yuan

Shanghai Exchange: 100.05 yuan

(The Shanghai Exchange rate is the amount Tianjin should receive for 100 yuan exchanged in Shanghai)

### Demand for Foreign Exchange Futures Remains Strong

Arbitrageurs Sell Near and Buy Far

Extremely Tight Before Finally Returning to Equilibrium

The foreign exchange market was eager to be purchased by oil companies, Texaco, and other major foreign firms, while Chinese firms, Chinese merchants, speculators, and foreign banks were also competing to purchase. Although major British and American banks were still willing to supply spot goods at special prices, the intention to supply futures seemed somewhat weak. Although Hong Kong Telegraph and Sassoon, a Western merchant, once sold, they still felt that the supply was insufficient, so the process was once extremely tight. The British gold price for August once tightened to 7 pence and 9375, and the American exchange rate also softened to 15.4375 yuan. Later, because it aroused the interest of arbitrageurs, the price turned flat.

### Metals

Black Iron Billets: Arrivals and Sales are Both Brisk

Previously, due to a shortage of black woven billets and strong demand from merchant gangs, the market was swept clean. Recently, new goods have started to arrive, but the Tianjin gang and the wood street thermos bottle factories are all rushing to process, and the market goods have a tendency to be sold as soon as they arrive. The market price is 30 yuan per box for 200-pound goods, and 32 yuan per box (calculated at 200 pounds) for 2,000-pound goods, which is 1 yuan better than the Weng market. More than 200 boxes were sold yesterday, but spot goods feel even thinner, and market sentiment is very good, and the asking price for the market is expected to continue to rise. It is found that new goods from overseas, such as 100-pound goods, are priced at 45 gold yuan per ton, and 2,000-pound goods are priced at 50 gold yuan per ton, and there are no recent spot goods.

### Yarn and Cotton

Yarn and Cloth Amidst Raging Winds and Torrential Rains

Actual sales remain stagnant: Relying solely on "passing the buck" trading among peers

Feeling of too much inventory: Selling prices drop by around 10 yuan

Japanese yarn speculators: Rumors of several stranded due to being squeezed

Recently, the cotton yarn market has seen surging waves, like being in the midst of a storm. In reality, after consecutive days of rising prices, customer sales have been scarce and stagnant. Therefore, buying and selling ensues, and when inventory feels slightly excessive, the market plunges. However, when prices are low, buyers return and prices quickly rebound. This kind of unstable situation is completely manipulated by speculators. High prices make people disoriented and unable to make decisions, creating a chaotic situation. In the afternoon, a sudden gust of speculative wind arose, causing those with a lot of speculative positions to sell, as actual sales did not come. It is found that yesterday's yarn price difference was more than 10 yuan.

Regarding the current yarn situation, the market at the opening this morning was stable, and most were in a long position, so there was a consensus that the market would improve. Therefore, the opening price was often high, with the spot price for 20s Double Horse yarn still bid at 410 yuan, and the stack ticket price at 430 yuan, with little difference from the previous day. However, only 10 bales were traded among peers. Soon, the market gradually declined as the need for quality remained scarce and stagnant, with the price at 435 yuan, and the stack ticket price at 425 yuan, a drop of 5 yuan from the opening price. Subsequently, as the price loosened, multiple parties returned to action, and the purchase momentum reached its peak around 11 o'clock, with a slight rebound of two or three yuan. The spot price did 438-9 yuan, and the stack ticket price reached 428-9 yuan to 430 yuan. It is found that the market transactions were all "passing the buck" trading among peers. The market in the afternoon was dull, barely opening down by 1 yuan. Soon, sellers gathered, and the selling was strong, and the situation suddenly turned weak, with a sudden drop of 5 or 6 yuan. The spot price was 431 yuan, and the stack ticket price was 422 yuan. Tiannv stack tickets only dropped to 420 yuan. According to market rumors, certain parties were deliberately selling to push down the price, but it was only due to stagnant actual sales. As a result, various gangs bought a total of 1,363 bales. The market prices for 20s Double Horse and Tiannv brands fell by 7 or 8 yuan, Muyang fell by 12 yuan, Shuang Diqiu fell by 8.5 yuan, and other mid-range yarns fell by 4, 5, or 6 yuan. Yesterday, 30 pieces of yarn were shipped from Hong Kong. Today, 655 pieces of cotton yarn are being shipped to Tianjin, 565 pieces to Shantou, 22 pieces to Quanzhou, 11 pieces to Xiamen, and 545 pieces to Hong Kong. The quantities purchased by the various gangs are listed below:

Peers: 1,050 Inland: 125

Hong Kong: 78 Shantou: 10

Jiangxi: 15 Sichuan: 85

Total: 1,363

The Japanese yarn market, which had been soaring for days, suddenly suffered a setback. According to market rumors, due to excessive recent rallies, those who sold short were squeezed and suffered heavy losses. Considering this environment, the trend could not be sustained, and several companies were stranded due to illiquidity. Therefore, blindly raising market prices resulted in the pain of not being able to collect the money even if they made a profit. Yesterday's price change was particularly shocking. The price rose by 5 yuan in the morning, fell by 10 yuan at noon, and suddenly collapsed in the afternoon. The high and low prices of the day differed by 20 yuan. It is found that many people only listen to the market price in the Qingdao Exchange and use it as a ratio and standard, resulting in huge waves. The highest price of 20s Yueqin in the morning was 400 yuan, and the closing price in the afternoon was only 380 yuan, a drop of 20 yuan. In this situation, some people made a fortune, and others lost everything, which is also to be expected.

### US Cotton Acreage Estimated to Increase; Over 10,000 Bales of Indian Cotton Continued to be Ordered

In the foreign cotton market, New York cotton prices opened slightly higher by two or three pounds. Traders and spot merchants are selling recent contracts and rolling into deferred, as the spread between the nearby 70's and the new crop are large. The US government export subsidy issue is unresolved leaving many watchful. Senator Smith from the south indicates that these believe the export subsidy issue will fall by the wayside, and that he will gather southern senators to fight the opposition for export subsidies. The New York "Fa Te" (transliteration) published an estimate yesterday that the total cotton acreage in the United States is 27,197,000 acres, a 4% increase from the previous estimate. Nearby contracts in New York fell one to six points while deferred contracts rose five to seven points yesterday. Predictions are that Indian cotton will fall by one Rupee, Egyptian cotton is halted, cotton prices are flat and in legal tender values American, Brazilian and Indian cotton is down by a little over 40 cents per Dan (unit of weight).

The Shanghai foreign cotton market has been quite lively in recent days, with a total of over 10,000 bales of Indian cotton ordered yesterday. Wah Fung (transliteration) took 4,000 bales while British and Japanese factories bought over 7,000. The existing stock at the Japanese factories is extremely low and close to being completely depleted. Those shipping from Japan have been actively searching for spot goods. We list below the prices yesterday for cotton to be sent to the factories:

Raw Materials / Category / To Factory with Taxes
60 count Egyptian cotton high grade 104.25
ditto medium grade 101.30
80 count ditto high grade 214.60

24 count Indian Kangbodi (transliteration) 81.05
32 count American Zhongte (transliteration) 81.75
32/42 count American Pengjiapu (transliteration) 89.25

The local cotton market has become dull with all the factories' "stomachs" closed; thus the market becomes despondent. There were two transactions for Indian cotton by peers, where the market prices rose slightly, the local prices for spot goods also rose with it, as prices for Indian corner pieces rose, 408 bales of Su Bei to Tongzhou cotton arrived, there are 3,000 pieces of cotton shipping from here to Shantou, we list the existing cotton market here:

### Sugar Market

Raw White Soaring Even More Fiercely

Origin Reclaims Futures Again

Yesterday's Dutch crystal white price rose because the origin had reclaimed the July/August contracts again at 9.70 Dutch currency. The Tai Koo sugar mill in Hong Kong has also ceased selling, thus the market has become even more excited and has risen one yuan again. According to the guild's board, the outside storage price for No. 2 crystal white rose to 28 yuan and 7 jiao, and the local storage was 28 yuan and 8 jiao. It even called for prices as high as 29 yuan and 2 jiao. The initial marked price for re-exported goods was 20 yuan and 4 jiao, gradually rising to 0.8 jiao, with 1,300 bags transacted. Yi Chi also rose by half a yuan, with spot prices at 18 yuan and a half, and re-exported at 13 yuan. Local refined white followed suit, rising by one yuan, with Zhenji No. 1 at 28 yuan and a half, No. 2 at 28 yuan, No. 3 at 27 yuan and a half, and No. 4 at 27 yuan. The spot price for Tai Koo truck white B brand at the West Depot was 28 yuan and 4 jiao, OW brand at 28 yuan and 2 jiao, OX brand at 28 yuan, DY brand at 27 yuan and 8 jiao, and HX brand at 27 yuan and 7 jiao.

On the 3rd [date missing], 1,900 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong and 1,640 bags came from Xiamen.

### Food

Flour Prices Look Promising

Factory Price Higher Than Foreign Wheat - Large Shipment of Australian Wheat to Arrive

Factory Flour: The factory flour market remains bullish. Since the No. 2 flour factory has raised prices to 4 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen in cash for several consecutive days, the factory still wants to raise prices and does not offer substantial supply. The reason for this is that the foreign production prices are rising frequently, and with the establishment of the "Hua Xing Bank" being voiced, prices are expected to rise, and market sentiment is consistently bullish. However, real sales by the northern gangs have also declined. At present, the exchange rate fluctuates too much, and they are not daring to take on significant risks. The goods purchased in the past two days were mostly speculative, so new transactions have decreased sharply. The southern gangs are also only making sporadic purchases. The total market transaction is around 30,000 bags. The market may have seen some support at one point.

Foreign Flour: Remains calm. According to inquiries, the goods arriving on the Tuoliti Bie Si (transliteration) ship are all Bat, Fox, and Shuang Ying brands. There is little supply on the market, and the supply should be limited. The current foreign production prices are rising frequently, and the costs of shipping insurance and other expenses are increasing, so the cost is higher, and the suppliers are unwilling to sell easily. Currently, the foreign flour market price is 4 yuan, 4 jiao to 3 jiao and a half in cash, but there are no large-scale transactions. Although the local factory flour is more expensive than foreign flour, the delivery deadline can be extended, so customers are paying attention to purchasing factory flour, causing the foreign flour market to be slightly suppressed.

Foreign Wheat: Australian wheat is arriving in Shanghai again. The King Winian, managed by Jardine Matheson, has shipped 92,011 bags of wheat from Australia, totaling 7,713 tons. The wheat is managed by the Liji Foreign Firm on Sichuan Road. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai today and is scheduled to berth at pontoons 11 and 12 to unload.

Exports: Today, there are 10,000 bags of flour being shipped to Tianjin, 14,200 bags to Xiamen, 22,900 bags to Quanzhou, 200 bags of bran to Quanzhou, and 500 bags of bran to Xiamen.

### Claiming Source Obstruction

Rice Prices Break Through the Limit

Guest Sen and Foreign Rice Do Well

National Rice: After the source was obstructed by various parties in the inland, fewer goods arrived in Shanghai. Fortunately, the warehouse goods gushed out, so the inventory felt thin. Stores and hoarders on the street massively collected the merchandise. Every day river trade under goods arrives at No. 1, train loads are only 14-1500 parcels, so the merchandise owners are thinking of snapping it up, the prices are breaking free of the 14 yuan limit as a result, and as a result thick and thin rice is priced at a high of 14 yuan, half, this is more than the earlier 3-5 jiao price increase, Du Yang tip tip is also doing better as a result, the market even called for 19 yuan because of shortages. In short, this market is affected by all sources and interior crude is at 12 yuan 5/6 jiao for the stout and 12 yuan or so for the thin.

Guest Sen: As big clients hoard, and the rumor is rife with "rice spikes", the sources are still coming in at 5-6000 bundles. Sources say that they're coming in daily at 5-6000 bundles, and merchants are charging higher because the costs have gone up, the prices of Jing Wu Sen is up to 13 yuan and the price has increased by 5-6 jiao per price, transactions were 7-8000 in huge transactions.

Foreign Rice: Yesterday, it was well received and local needs were unexpectedly strong, Saigon rice was at 14-1500 parcels for 17 yuan and 8 jiao, this is higher than the previous market by 2-3 jiao.

### Seafood

Arrowroot Production Price Highly Increasing

Arrowroot has been highly increase, in price of production sources in Holland. To compare to the price in Shanghai, a increase of more than 2 yuan is calculated, i.e. yesterday 2-4 "biau" (transliteration) parcels (previous trade was 14 yuan) will trade to 16 yuan and 5 jiao. All the others are raising in price, like "ren cheung biao" (transliteration) is at 22 yuan, "fei kei kei" (transliteration) is at 19 yuan, 3x is at 18 yuan and 5 jiao, KG is at 17 yuan and 5 jiao, 3t is at 13 yuan and 5 jiao. The trend is very good.

### Medicinal Materials

Xiamen Gardenia Sees New Stock

New stock of Xiamen gardenia has made its appearance, a number of vendor have transported a part to the recent markets, and will sell it immediately to distributors at a low price of 5-6 relative to the previous price.

### Silk and Tea

Silk Exports Greatly Boosted

New York Silk Market Experiences Squeeze Due to Stockpiling by Silk Mills

The foreign silk market is experiencing an intense bullish trend. New York spot silk is up two cents, nearby is up four cents, and deferred is up eight cents. Yokohama spot is opening at 1230 yen, a rise of 20 yen, and deferred is up 30 yen. It is reported that the squeeze in the New York silk market is not entirely due to speculation, but also due to a surge in purchasing by small silk mills. This factor is related to the current US policy, which emphasizes a Buy American campaign.

The local silk market saw a significant boost in exports yesterday. White factory silk, graded at 7-8, was sold from 1800 yuan to 1830 yuan. Jardine, Dachang, Lienat, and others purchased a total of 250 bales. Re-reeled silk, graded at six numbers, Qilin and Pao Ma grade were purchased by Renji, Dachang, and others for a total of 210 bales. The bargaining of manufacturers and silk merchants rose by around 50 yuan by the afternoon, so silk prices today are expected to continue to rise. On the 4th, there will be sixteen pieces of Xian silk shipped to Hong Kong. Also, on the 3rd, there were one thousand and twenty-six pieces of tea arriving from Hong Kong.

### Oil Cakes: Insiders and Outsiders Hoarding, Spot Soybean Oil

Raw Oil Shipped from Hong Kong and Xiamen

The price of raw oil is secretly stable, mainly because although the source has been available recently, various commodity prices are increasing daily due to seasonal and environmental factors. Therefore, the raw oil market is quite active in secret. Yesterday, the market for Jiaozhou oil for delivery in one week opened at 38 yuan, with over 200 transactions.

Three days ago, 400 pieces of raw oil arrived from Hong Kong and 500 pieces from Xiamen.

The potential for soybean oil to rise is even greater because futures trading has ended. Subsequent supplies will inevitably be monopolized, leading speculators both inside and outside the industry with capital to purchase spot goods. As a result, market prices are rising. Yesterday, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at 33.5 yuan, and 150 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil at 34.2 yuan and 34 yuan. Fifty large baskets of Lianqi soybean oil traded at 44.5 yuan. Over 300 barrels of Da Yun spot oil increased from 46.35 yuan to 46.55 yuan.

### No Significant Changes in Pressed Cakes, Mostly Futures Trading

As for bean cake trading, only Da Yun cakes were traded yesterday. The market situation has not changed significantly recently, mainly because the inland market has been seized by fertilizer powder, resulting in sluggish sales of spot cakes. The market mainly focuses on futures trading, with prices fluctuating between one and two cents. Yesterday, 2,000 pieces of miscellaneous brand spot cakes were traded at 2.92 yuan, up one cent from the previous day. Miscellaneous brand futures for May opened at 2.945 yuan, and Yuanji opened at 2.95 yuan, with a total of 2,000 pieces traded. Miscellaneous brand futures for June opened at 3.045 yuan, and Yuanji from 3.08 yuan to 3.07 yuan, with a total of 5,000 pieces traded.

Regarding soybean imports, 984 bags arrived from Tianjin three days ago. Furthermore, on the fourth, 280 bags were exported to Quanzhou, 300 bags to Hong Kong, and 50 bags to Hong Kong. Moreover, three days ago, 5,000 pieces of cottonseed oil arrived from Tianjin.

### Textiles: Profitable Resales of Second-Hand Goods, Slight Dip in the Cloth Market

Increased Warehouse Construction in Haiphong, Strong Sales Expected

Domestic Cloth

The market slightly softened due to profitable resales of second-hand goods by peers. For white cloth, Jardine Matheson's weaving factory quoted the highest price for 1,000 pieces each of light and heavy grades for this month, with second-hand goods priced down by 5 to 20 cents per bolt. Fine cloth and fine twill also decreased by about 10 cents per bolt. Wholesale shops in this street purchased over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. Stockpilers absorbed 200 pieces of coarse cloth. Banks handled 100 pieces of Fugui Earth, Dapeng fine cloth, and fine twill for transport to Kunming. Dyeing and printing factories are reluctant to buy, while scattered second-hand goods are sold at low prices. Wholesale shops on Wood Street are selectively gathering cheap goods, with 300 to 400 boxes of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, and serge being traded. Autumn and winter goods are receiving the most attention. Customers from Sichuan and Guizhou are rushing to ship goods. It is heard that banks and transportation companies are actively constructing more warehouses for the goods accumulated in Haiphong awaiting shipment. In the future, difficulties in storing goods will be avoided, and sales are expected to be even stronger.

Eastern Cloth

The price of fine cloth and fine twill fell in the morning but recovered in the afternoon, and the market atmosphere turned calm. Twelve-pound Longtou, Yanghe, and other brands of fine cloth opened at around 14.6 yuan in the morning and rose to 14.8 or 14.9 yuan in the afternoon, with futures at 15.15 yuan, a decrease of 10 cents from the previous day's price. Fine twill also continued to decline slightly. Spot Yanghe was 13.9 yuan per bolt. Because outside stockpilers did not come to buy, and sales among peers and customer groups were limited, only about 1,000 pieces were traded throughout the day. Trading firms did not quote prices, and shops in this street purchased 700 to 800 pieces, while northern merchants purchased over 300 pieces.

Exports

On the fourth, 165 pieces of textiles were exported, with 16 pieces transported to You Tou, 150 pieces to Quanzhou, and 150 pieces to Hong Kong.

### The Achievements of the April Counteroffensive

— Mao Lie

A few days ago, military observers in London said that it was doubtful whether it was a smart move for the Chinese army to counterattack Guangzhou and Nanchang at this time and recapture them. Their meaning is easy to understand: the Chinese army at this time does not need to launch a counterattack, let alone a general counterattack, to recapture a city or town at a great cost. Such recapture is not worth the loss.

Now, our first large-scale counteroffensive has come to a temporary end with the passing of April. Reviewing the opinions of the London military observers, we feel that they do have considerable reason, which is also similar to the opinions of most of us: counterattacks are necessary when the opportunity arises, but it is not necessary to occupy any city. Therefore, although the April counteroffensive did not permanently recapture Guangzhou or Nanchang, the role of the counteroffensive was fully realized.

Our army's counterattack on Guangzhou foiled the enemy's attempt to attack Xijiang and take Guangxi; the counterattack on Nanchang shattered their dream of capturing Changsha; and the counterattack on the east bank of the Han River made them give up their delusion of crossing the Han River to spy on Shashi and Yichang. These are all obvious facts that do not require any embellishment. If there had been no such counterattacks, the enemy would have exclusively occupied the initiative, moving at will, and we would have been unable to prevent it. I am afraid that the front lines of both sides would have moved westward by some distance.

From this, it can be seen that our army's counterattack is necessary, but it is not necessary to rigidly adhere to one place and disrupt the overall war plan. From this, it can also be seen that our army does have the strength to counterattack, and once the time is ripe, it can sweep down with the force of a broken bamboo and recover all the lost land. From this, it can be further seen that the enemy's strength is indeed limited, and we will eventually have a day when we can take whatever we want from them.

Before our army's counterattack, many people were eagerly expecting the counterattack: they were somewhat disappointed when the counterattack did not start. During the course of the counterattack, many people were eagerly awaiting victory; they were somewhat disappointed when victory did not come continuously. Now, after the counteroffensive has come to an end, I believe there must still be many people waiting incessantly for another counteroffensive; they will inevitably be disappointed or even frustrated when the counteroffensive is delayed again. I want to say to them: their enthusiasm is commendable; their disappointment or discouragement is unnecessary! We have a clear plan; we have inevitable victory!

The April counteroffensive can be used as a transitional stage from defense to complete counteroffensive. It is an important link in the entire war process, and its value is self-evident. In order to achieve future victories, we must cherish this April counteroffensive and regard it as our initial success!

### Soviet Female Aviator (Part 2)

— By Polina Osipenko, Translated from Moscow News by He Yan

I deeply begged the principal, I decided I want to be an aviator! I want to defend the country and never lose to other men! The principal smiled, he suggested I could take a physical exam, and the doctors all said I qualified.

After that, I was a student at the aviation school, I had a uniform and a room in the dormitory.

I don't want to tell you about the difficulties at the beginning now, I read books from morning till noon till night, the desire was so great, I wanted to be a knowledgeable aviator, I was stingy with every minute other than reading.

At the same time, I saw many aviators, and things that I could not have imagined before. I saw a destroyer flying like a rocket in the air, turning right and then left, rotating its body, flipping somersaults, flying out of ring patterns. This machine like a beetle was wonderfully obedient in the air, performing strange performances under precise calculations. It was as silent as a wren, as elusive as a swallow, soaring over Ukraine.

Airplanes landed one after another, I watched the faces of the aviators coming out of the cockpits, they were superhuman, with incredible and brimming skills.

He, who drove that destroyer, among many people, his face, his pace, his smile, what was different from ordinary people? I thought, his story was no different from going from a factory or a collective farm, a young Communist Youth League member, to an aviation school.

He started flying alone, not long before me. The students did not talk much about their first flight, soon it was my turn.

One day, I came back from practicing with the teacher, and I made a very bad landing. At that time, I really didn't dream that I would be flying alone. My teacher didn't say a word about my bad landing, but turned around and asked me if I was tired.

"No," I said.

"Good, you can do a solo flight."

Happiness and suddenness made me almost afraid to breathe, but I did not abandon my consciousness.

"Very good, teacher," I calmly replied.

I went up, I will not forget this moment, I was alone in the air, the teacher was on the ground, I was flying alone. I made a satisfactory landing, I took off again for the second time, everything was going well, and that's how my solo flying began.

But, I still have a long way to go, I decided I wanted to become a successful aviator.

At the end of 1932, I graduated from aviation school, I was sent to learn to be a military aviator.

Soon I was appointed as a squad leader, my work achievements obviously made great progress. In addition to my main work, I also did many social things, helping my husband study and work. I continued to work hard, I learned to drive, and at the same time I paid attention to my education. I graduated from a labor school, and I was preparing to enter a military aviation school again. I flew for six years, and nothing happened, not even a forced landing. . . . . . . . .

When I had enough confidence, I asked my commander to allow me to make a long-distance flight, he thought for a while and said:

"I advise you to make a flight to the highest altitude beforehand, do you agree?"

I agreed.

In September 1936, the commander called me and told me that I could make a flight to the highest altitude to test the maximum altitude of the aircraft.

I drove the "Vonda" seaplane, and I stayed at an altitude of 30,000 feet for 19 minutes. The plane could still rise higher, but I didn't dare to go to its limit. When I landed, Commander Jia Gen congratulated me.

"You have flown higher than any woman in the world," he said.

My husband, also a squad leader, also flew to a great altitude, but I surpassed him, surpassing everyone in our group. In this exercise, I reached 23,000 feet without using oxygen equipment.

In May 1938, I and my teammates Fran Romalina and Lanskova made a non-stop long-distance flight, establishing an international women's long-distance flight record, flying around with our seaplane, we flew one thousand and ninety-three miles.

On July 2, 1938, we came again for a non-stop flight, from Sebastopol to Arkhangelsk, passing one thousand seven hundred and seven miles in ten hours and thirty-three minutes.

These are recorded in the Aviation Games Committee, creating two all-Soviet women's flight records, straight-line flight and curved-line flight.

Having received the Order of Lenin and government rewards, Lomako and I both received the rank of captain, and Lansko Fa was also promoted to deputy captain.

I will never rest for the sake of honor, I will continue to work hard, flying to higher altitudes and longer distances! (The End)

### Odds and Ends

— Editor

Because the "power" radical is unnecessary for the character "move" in "labor," it is also thought that generally the various characters that are unnecessarily and excessively given radicals can indeed save a few things. For example: "read," "taste," "where" (when used for "there"), "vortex," etc., the mouth radical and the three-dot water radical are not necessary, and the meaning is naturally clear.

### The May Fourth Movement Today

— Ren Yi

Twenty years ago today, the young students of Beiping wrote a particularly glorious page in history with their bloodstains. The significance and value of the May Fourth Movement can be said to be the opportunity for a "Renaissance in the Orient of the 21st century."

Today, it is worth re-evaluating it. In terms of the law of historical development, commemorating the May Fourth Movement does not mean hoping to have a repeated writing; on the contrary, it means abandoning all that was old in the past and evolving new things. The May Fourth Movement of the past was: 1. Overthrowing the humiliating treaties and traitors. 2. Establishing the foundation for a new anti-feudal culture. Now, to meet the needs of the times, it is necessary to more powerfully complete the new mission:

1. Chairman Chiang said: "Compromise halfway is destruction." For the survival, independence, and freedom of the nation, this sacred duty of resistance; we must absolutely and resolutely abide by the three major principles of "nation above all, nation above all; military first, victory first; concentration of will, concentration of strength," and have the belief that "resistance will be victorious, and nation-building will be successful." 2. For any traitorous distorted theories, we must be vigilant at all times, constantly guard against them, and even more ruthlessly expose, attack, and eliminate them, because tolerance is equivalent to surrendering to the aggressors. Here, it is especially necessary to rectify our ranks of young students to shoulder the important task of the nation's vanguard.

3. In addition, "We must not only resist, but we must also build the country." Under the goal of striving for final victory, we should enrich our lives, strengthen our bodies, correct our thoughts, not be passive, not fall behind, and not be reactionary: contribute everything to the country, muster the spirit of great fearlessness, and work hard for the great cause of national liberation.

Friends! Do not fail our present, and write a more glorious page in history! (Proceeds from charity performance)

### Today's Commemoration

— Dian Zhang

Today, May Fourth, is "Youth Day." It was a great new movement of the Chinese nation against aggression and feudalism: as the vanguard of promoting the new cultural movement, it laid the cornerstone of the new culture. Here, Chinese youth first appeared with a new and sharp fighting posture.

It was precisely because the European war had just ended that the international situation was in a state of confusion, and semi-colonial China had a rare opportunity; but because it failed to clearly recognize the contradictions between the great powers and seize the opportunity well, it ended up failing at the Paris conference, while the distant imperialists took advantage of their superior position to aggressively press forward, giving the Chinese ruling class a very strong stimulus; they felt the weakness of the feudal government, and under the slogan of "fighting for national rights abroad and punishing traitors at home," they bravely struggled, and the Northern Warlords were finally forced to punish the traitors who humiliated the country. However, at the Washington Conference, "national rights" were still not obtained, which was the most painful page in the history of diplomacy.

On the other hand, it also showed that China's new social strata had not grown sufficiently and failed to deeply penetrate the broad lower classes to form a strong battle line against the outside world; and the feudal forces' stubborn rebellious role precisely reflected the fact that the new moderate movement was not promoted enough--its "enlightenment" only reached a few, and the masses were not organically linked, and the will and strength were not concentrated as a whole, which was such a pity.

Mr. Democracy, clad in a false disguise, was unable to exert a positive effect; and the task of enabling the social means of production to be automated, which Science contemplated, was not completed, which was the misfortune of the semi-colonial country at that time.

The new culture of the May Fourth Movement in the East was a continuation of the Xinhai Revolution, seeking a thorough transformation in the ideological realm to adapt to the weak economic foundation of the new social strata. It certainly had a flourishing and vigorous atmosphere for a time, but the subsequent difficulty was precisely due to its objective conditions. Here, we must criticize it rigorously and historically.

Today is the twentieth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, and the great and unprecedented national resistance has lasted for more than twenty months, and the day of final victory is not far away. When we look back on the past and seize the present, we feel both infinite sorrow and joy: the historical mission left by the May Fourth Movement must be quickly completed at this time.

Naturally, history is dialectically progressing: the international situation is already different from what it used to be, and who is clothing us and who is attacking us must be clearly recognized; China has stood firm on its own and is actively striving for international friendship, which is the most urgent task in diplomacy: genuine allies should come here (and there is one that has never existed in previous history, which should be paid more attention to). Those who have bad intentions should not come, and the accomplices should get out of here! We must more thoroughly "punish traitors at home," and in the crisis of the war of resistance, we must avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, and we can no longer lightly forgive the microbes of history; we must inherit and expand the anti-traitor and anti-feudal movement.

Here, it should be mentioned that the new enlightenment movement, which was pointed out before "August 13," is now being put into practice with greater development in the process of the war of resistance, and it cannot be separated from the war of resistance and nation-building, and has long been linked together. Different from the enlightenment movement of the May Fourth Movement, it gave the masses a kind of spiritual liberation: clearing away ignorant traditional concepts; strengthening a strong national consciousness; popularizing new scientific ideas; and supporting genuine democratic politics. Only it can consolidate the great national united front and ensure the final victory of the war of resistance; and it can further serve as the spiritual foundation for building an independent, free, and equal new China.

At present, the general mobilization program of the national spirit proposed by Chairman Chiang is a more concrete way to arm the people's thinking and make it match the war of resistance; in order to achieve this unified goal, further expanding the new enlightenment movement is one of the greatest tasks at present.

Let us repeat a sentence: The historical mission left by the May Fourth Movement must be quickly completed at this stage. (Charity Donation)

### Record of Wang Youchen's Spirit Manifestation After Death (Part 1)

— Su Shaoqing

I happened to hear Wang Youchen's "Crashing the Stele" record on the radio. This reminded me of the manifestation of Youchen's spirit to me last year after his death. I have long wanted to write it out to tell my fellow opera fans, but I have been too busy. However, this matter often lingers in my mind. As the saying goes, "A true friendship is seen in life and death." I have known Youchen the longest. Whether his entry into my dream was a return of his soul or just an accidental dream of mine, I cannot know. However, we have known each other for more than twenty years and he never sought to enter my dream. Only half a month after his death, I dreamed of him and conversed with him. There must be a reason, and it is necessary to record the whole story, as well as the process of our acquaintance. It can be regarded as mourning him and crying for him.

In the early years of the Republic of China, Youchen, as an amateur opera performer, soon entered the profession and performed at a certain stage in Shanghai (it seems to be the first stage of Dangui), which was quite well-received. My fellow villager Mr. Chen Ziliang (also an opera enthusiast, who died early) listened to Youchen's opera together and invited him to visit. During the conversation, Youchen said: "We are fellow villagers, and our ancestral home is Xuzhou. Our ancestral graves are in Pu County, with Wanping as our second generation. Our original surname is Liu, and we adopted the surname Wang after inheriting from our maternal uncle." (Later, I met Mr. Liu Tiefu in Beiping, who was his brother. They had a discordant relationship.) This was the beginning of our friendship. In the following years, we often saw each other in Shanghai, but our friendship was not deep. Around the tenth year of the Republic, Youchen performed at the Yi Stage, singing "Catching and Releasing Cao" and "Inn," with many mistakes in the lyrics, which were reversed and almost made it impossible to finish the performance (the zither player was Xu Lanyuan). Seeing me watching the opera in the audience, he ordered his follower to invite me to his residence in Yingchunfang and asked me to smooth things over with the press and the amateur opera circles. Our friendship gradually deepened, and we often studied the tunes and words together. His second wife was the daughter of Tan Xinpei, commonly known as "Old Girl," who was not tall, spoke well, and suggested that Youchen and I become sworn brothers. So, we addressed each other as brothers, but there was no formal oath.

When Youchen sang "Fishing and Killing Family" at the Yi Stage, his spine dislocated by more than an inch. He was in so much pain that he could not go on stage. He consulted me for a doctor, and I asked Mr. Mi Jianhua, a specialist in northern-style massage and a martial artist, to massage him. He was able to go on stage in a few days and recovered completely in more than ten days. Youchen was proud in his prime. In the second and third years of the Republic, he greedily organized the Republican Central Stage and became its owner (later renamed Yi Stage, which is now the site of the new Huizhong). During the ten years from the age of thirty to forty, he was extremely successful. At that time, after the death of Lao Tan, Youchen, as his son-in-law, wanted to directly inherit the orthodox Tan style, using all the martial and civil music and stage personnel that Lao Tan used (the drummer was Liu Shunla, and the zither player was Xu Lanyuan; I don't remember the others). In the winter of the seventh year, Youchen returned to Beiping. I saw him singing "Empty City Stratagem" at Qingleyuan on the first day (singing to the point where the Nanyang rhythm was unstable, which I will not elaborate on as it is not the main point of this article). At that time, Yan Jupeng had not yet entered the profession, Ma Lianliang was working in Fuliangcheng, Yu Shuyan's voice had not recovered, and he was performing amateur opera at the Zhejiang-Cihui Hall. Gao Qingkui was still performing hard roles, and Tan Fuying had not yet finished his training. Therefore, Youchen was able to be very popular for a while. He performed at the Yi Stage in Shanghai for the longest time. "Zhuge Liang Marrying a Bride" was produced at this time. Youchen played Zhuge Liang as a young man without sideburns, and also dressed as a female role to perform "Spinning Cotton," singing various folk tunes, starting the trend of Beijing opera senior actors creating new plays and cross-dressing as female roles, which also started with Youchen.

### Abandoned Child · Mother Returns · Ward No. 5: Three Plays for Charity

— Du Shui

Raising Funds for Refugee Education, "Patriotic" Daughters Rise Up

The early summer breeze brushed the sweat from the girls' foreheads. At 2 o'clock on Saturday afternoon, the hall of the Ningbo Fellow Association was draped in a simple garment. The amateur performance of the Patriotic Girls' High School opened.

Accordion performances and tap dancing were interludes between the three short plays.

"Abandoned Child" was performed first. This is a realistic scene, depicting several women in a shelter who have been subjected to harsh weather. One of them, unable to afford to raise her child, tearfully separates from her flesh and blood. "Mother Returns" is a one-act play that seems to oppose feudalism. It presents two absolute extremes of women's widowhood and remarriage to the audience. A son, because of his mother's elopement and abandonment, ten years later resolutely refuses the return of his fallen and remorseful mother, and even refuses to call her "Mama" when she asks him to. "Ward No. 5" is a three-act play. It is more than just a tragic love story that exposes ugly aspects of society. These three plays were directed by Mr. Xu Lili and Mr. Fang Hudao, and the latter two plays were rehearsed by the newly established "Patriotic Drama Club."

In terms of script, "Mother Returns" is written more successfully. Apart from a slightly slack passage at the beginning, from the mother's appearance until the end of the play, almost every dialogue can tightly grasp the characters' emotional atmosphere. "Ward No. 5" incorporates many humorous elements. "Abandoned Child" seems a bit weak in its description. The consciousness is not vague, but the technique is not sufficient.

In terms of performance, it is worth mentioning the role of the mother in "Mother Returns." Her performance is very realistic. The younger sister in "Ward No. 5" is also very kind. The rest are generally not bad, especially the makeup is even better.

Amateur actors certainly won't achieve perfect results. The diamond ring on the refugee's finger and the origin of the sedative in the ward are all things that should be noted. In terms of effects, the car horn outside the door and the moans of patients in the neighboring room should also be improved. The director's handling in "Abandoned Child" is not very good. It loses the power to control the climax. When the child enters the door, she neither cries "Mama" nor rushes forward, and she remains silent when she leaves, which makes the play much weaker.

Another thing worth mentioning is that a consumer cooperative held a charity sale in the theater, and the results were very good. When we came out, the sky was covered by night.

### A Brief Account of Watching "Before Yanmen Pass" at the Golden Theater

— Wu Wozun

Mr. Wozun, whose name is Boqiao, is from Wujin. He is over sixty years old and has published a collection of poems and essays by Boqiao, which was greatly admired by the late Zhang Qian'an of Nantong. He started playing opera very early. The talent of the former Nantong Opera School was due to Segin's invitation to Ouyang Yuqian and Wu Wozun as teachers (Yuqian's plays were also mostly taught by Wu). He has been a long-time resident of Shanghai and has never set foot in the opera world. This article can be said to be rare. With the introduction of Brother Zhang Xiaocang, it is specially published to show respect and for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts. (Ping's note)

In the past decade, the pen has been at my disposal. Day and night, I have been constantly occupied. Apart from being invited by Wan Hua to watch her perform "Assassinating the Tiger" and watching Xiao Yun's "Sacrificing the Pagoda" at the Huang Yu Theater, and watching Chunhang's "Flower Field Wrong" and Feng Xiaoqing's several plays, I have rarely frequented opera houses. Recently, Guo Mingsue invited me to watch "Before Yanmen Pass" at the Golden Theater, which I was extremely satisfied with. I recall that in the past, in Peking, I watched the collaboration of De Lin, Yun Fu, Yao Qing, Wan Hua, Feng Qing, and Suo Yun, which was mature and flawless. Finally, in Shanghai, at the Gongwu Stage, I watched Yao Qing's Empress Xiao, You Qing's Qing Lian, and Ju Peng and Zhong Ren playing the fourth and eighth princes, which was not inferior to the well-matched cast in Peking. However, Yao Qing's performance was experienced and her lines were crisp. Compared to De Lin, they achieved the same effect through different means. This time, E Yun, under the guidance of Yao Qing, rehearsed and performed the play, earning great acclaim and attracting large audiences. E Lou's demeanor was elegant, and her singing and recitation were solid. Among female performers, she is a top talent. Sheng Lansheng is fresh and handsome, and her future is limitless. Shi Sen's fourth prince, although he did not fully display his talents, was still natural and graceful, truly showing the style of a master. Among them, Tong Shan (Jiarong Cao)'s Empress Xiao was the most well-suited. Tong Shan was famous along with Xiao Yun at a young age in Zhengle. After she came of age, she devoted herself to research. After returning north from Tianchan, she received the true teachings of Yao Qing. She was particularly detailed and meticulous in her portrayal of Qing costume plays. She also humbly sought advice from De Lin and Gui, so she was able to draw on the strengths of others and form her own style. Her voice gradually became clear and mellow after the Republic of China, and her tone was able to maintain elegance and correctness. She can be said to be someone who can establish herself. In this play, her singing, recitation, expression, and steps were all a collection of the essence of De Lin and Yao Qing. Together, they heard the eight sounds of the fraudulent pass. Angered, Qing Lian wanted to uphold the law, but in the end, she was moved by the cries of her two grandchildren and reluctantly forgave her beloved daughter. It was not easy to resolve the conflict between public duty and personal feelings, between law and emotion. Sometimes her voice and expression were powerful, and sometimes she shed tears of old age. Her portrayal was subtle and vivid, capturing the essence of the character. Tong Shan is still in her prime, and her skills have already reached a state of perfection, which is not easy to achieve. I recently met with my old friend Mr. Yang, who also praised Cheng Tong Shan's performance in this play as a successful masterpiece. Furthermore, Tong Shan secluded herself to refine her skills, not seeking fame or vanity. She never cared about the ranking of plays or the order of names on the poster. Her magnanimity is especially beyond the reach of ordinary people. In addition, Yan Shishan's fourth wife, her appearance and expression, is not only unique among martial actors, but also ranks among the top choices among female actors. Others, such as Yu Sulian's Bi Lian, Liu Lianrong's Meng Liang, and Guan Shengxi's Sixth Prince, were all competent. Ma Fulu's cross-dressing as She Taijun had an extremely loud voice, but unfortunately, his demeanor was close to that of an old man, which only won the audience's laughter, which is the means of a famous clown and should not be criticized.

### Recent News from the Dumei Theater

The Dumei Theater at the intersection of Dumei Road was founded by a group of well-known foreign expatriates in Shanghai. It has strong capital and a grand scale. The site has already started construction, and the project is huge. It is expected to open in the latter half of this month. It is said that the company pays great attention to film selection and will choose first-class films to screen. At that time, it will add a special touch to the Shanghai film industry.

### Anecdotes from the Opera World

— Xu Muyun

Reasons for the Rise in the Status of Actors After the Republic of China

The plays were taught for three days. Here is a list of the most well-matched plays for your reference. I believe opera fans will be able to imagine the grand occasion at that time. If we were to calculate the ticket prices for Sun, Yang, Yu, Mei, Liu, and others performing solo, even if we calculated each person's ticket price at two or three yuan, then the ticket price for these famous actors performing together would have to be more than ten yuan. For three days, it would cost thirty or forty yuan. At that time, I only spent the round-trip fare from Shanghai to Bengbu and was able to hear these rare plays. Therefore, I often consider this to be a great fortune in my life.

(II) Zhang Xun, the Pigtail General, also held a grand performance in Xuzhou

In the fifth year of the Republic of China, Zhang Dingwu was stationed in Xuzhou as the Yangtze River Patrol Envoy. He repeatedly sent people to Beijing to invite famous male and female actors such as Hou Junshan, Wang Youchen, Guan Dayuan, Meng Xiaoru, and Wang Keqin to Xuzhou to participate in the performance to celebrate his birthday and the completion of his ancestral hall. As mentioned in "Secret History of the Pear Garden in the Former Capital," Zhang Xun and Hou Junshan had a close relationship. Zhang Xun had been Hou Junshan's servant in his early years, so when Hou arrived in Xuzhou, he stayed at the Patrol Envoy's residence and dined with Zhang, receiving his utmost hospitality. It was not only because Hou and Zhang had a special personal friendship, but also because Hou was deeply favored by Zhang. It was a case of "love me, love my dog." The status of the actors was raised considerably without intention. - (II)

### Grand Water Dragon Festival

(See this newspaper from May of the eleventh year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty)

Last night, the Shanghai Water Dragon Festival was held, and the viewers packed the streets. Starting from nine o'clock, the public water dragons were all arranged at the Gongzheng Wharf on the Bund. There were seven in total, and their styles were exquisite and varied. They were arranged in rows, neat and orderly. Torches and fireballs, along with white letters, and two bands played drums and flutes. The Western patrolmen held whips and sticks, and the procession started leisurely from the Bund in the French Concession. All the uniforms followed their respective colors, red ones in red, and black ones in black. Behind the water dragons were the Chinese who had joined the association, mostly from the tea, silk, and other industries. Each industry donated funds to help, so they also had a certain uniform and a certain style of lantern. The lanterns were all tall-handled. The crowd was dense and crowded, with no less than one or two thousand people forming a team. Those who pulled the water dragons were either Westerners or Chinese, and their uniforms were also of various colors. From the British Concession, the lights stretched far to the Huangpu Bund, like stars in the sky, the fire like bright cinnabar, and the light like flowing electricity, extending for half a mile. And occasionally, a blue fireball appeared, and then a yellow fireball, and then a green fireball, and then a white fireball. It was truly a spectacle to behold! After walking around for a week, to the Municipal Council, the fire festival building was covered with five-colored glass lamps, and fire signs were launched from the building from time to time. The fire signs were as high as the clouds, beyond the reach of Chinese meteors. When they flew up, they shot straight into the constellations, and halfway up, a full moon shape appeared, bright and radiant, like the Guanghan Palace. Suddenly, it burst open, and countless sparks scattered and fell, like stars falling like rain. As soon as one sign fell, another sign rose, and the viewers were dazzled and swayed, looking up in surprise! Then they turned west on the main road, then south again, passed the Sanmaoge Bridge, and then turned back to the Bund, before dispersing.

The next day, we will publish excerpts of important diplomatic news.
