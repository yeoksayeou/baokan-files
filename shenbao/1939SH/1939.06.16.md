### The Tianjin Situation Troubles England

"When can the British government reinvigorate Britain's prestige?"

This was the question posed yesterday in Parliament by British Member of Parliament Mr. Ponsonby, addressed to the British authorities. We, residing tens of thousands of miles away from England, are unable to witness the scene firsthand; yet, in a nation of gentlemen, a model of parliamentary governance, at a time when the world watches with bated breath, under an atmosphere of solemnity, such a question was raised. How difficult is it to imagine the speaker's emotions: how depressed, how perplexed, how blood-stirring, how tearful? This is the sentiment shared by almost all Englishmen, and even friends of England, all who love England; they are filled with such doubt and worry, and all sympathize with this question. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Butler, representing the government, remained silent and unable to respond. Alas, what a scene of momentary silence! What a portent! Can it be said that this is not the eve of the decline of the British Empire, such darkness and desolation? Can it be said that this is not the eve of the British Empire cleansing its filth and striving to be great again, such composure and solemnity? This is not a matter for emotional arguments or hypersensitive perceptions; those who love England harbor anxieties, and those who envy England coldly observe the opportunities. Have you not heard the London dispatch from the German Transocean News Agency on the 14th? In describing the Tianjin situation, it stated, "The prestige of the Great British Empire, its success or failure, will be judged by this event." It stated that Germans today regard Britain with mockery and gloating in its bewilderment and distress, without intending to provoke or awaken it to urge Britain to take a firm stance against Japan. This is absolutely impossible and will never happen. Those who love it and those who envy it speak and see alike, as if it were the voice of nature, and thus must be the truth.

The outcome of the Tianjin situation is yet to be seen, currently unfolding. As of the time the reporter takes up his pen, there is not only no sign of easing tensions, but it is also reported that Japan, after implementing a blockade of the British and French concessions, is preparing to have 50,000 Japanese residents and 2,000 reservists, under the pretext of visiting graves, march into the British concession. The intentions demonstrated by the Japanese government and public far exceed this. For example, a military spokesman stated that they demand Britain recognize the new order in East Asia proposed by Japan. A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that Britain must guarantee not to interfere in Japan's Far East policy. Newspaper editorials stated that foreign concessions in China have proven to be the greatest obstacle to Japan's establishment of a new East Asian order, and therefore should be abolished entirely. All of this means that we do not need to analyze its implications or explain its impact. Even the most foolish can directly understand their desires from their words. I only wish to add that these are all reports from Tokyo by various news agencies in recent days and must be widely published in newspapers worldwide today and yesterday, as they are confirmed news. Therefore, it is said that not only is there no sign of easing, but the situation is becoming increasingly serious, even extreme; this is to be expected.

The world's public opinion and governments, except for the Soviet Union, which has shown no reaction, all express concern about the Tianjin situation. Some deliberately feign composure and subtly express optimism, but these are mainly in England. They turn a blind eye to Japan's openly stated desires and rejection of arbitration methods, saying that the matter can be resolved through diplomatic channels. They also say that Japan does not want to create new disputes in the Far East, and Britain is focusing on dealing with European events, so it also wants to avoid disputes. Regardless of the source of funding for those who make such statements or their ethnicity, and without praising their extraordinary tolerance, they are insufficient to represent British public opinion, and it is even more impossible to see this as evidence that there is a trend toward easing. According to the latest news from London yesterday, the British government has indeed considered economic retaliation against Japan due to the Tianjin situation, strengthening practical assistance to China, and inviting joint action from the United States and France. Members of Parliament are rushing about, and the authorities are tense. The details of the events and people are described in today's newspapers, truly giving the impression that a storm is brewing. If this continues, the coast of the East Sea may face temporary and painful sacrifices, but the existing treaties related to the Far East will be preserved, the two-year war will be easier to end, international justice and human righteousness will be restored, and Britain's prestige will surely regain its former glory.

However, although the British government's proposed actions are as such, and the inevitable effects of pursuing them are as such, the actual outcome remains unknown. Why? Because action must have its effect, but plans may not be carried out. There are several demons at play: Japan implements a blockade of the Tianjin concessions, specially showing favor to American residents, while isolationists in America attempt to blockade President Roosevelt. The impact of this causes British policy to falter and courage to weaken. This is one distant demon. The urgent need for cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union is evident in Europe and also in the Far East; this has been the case for a long time, and the Tianjin situation proves it to be true. However, Britain is filled with anxiety about linking with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union is pleased to be arrogant and stubborn toward Britain. As a result, the factor that could most contribute to stability in the Far East is suppressed by the power struggle between the two sides. This is a second, closer demon. The various plans for dealing with Japan that Britain has proclaimed today and yesterday, if implemented, would certainly be effective. However, the traditional British view is that simply mentioning these plans is enough to make Japan wary, so they do not consider implementation to be necessary action but propaganda to be an effective method. Although the British are the most pragmatic nation in the world and despise politicians and propagandists who only talk and do nothing, they are blinded by their traditional self-esteem, overestimating themselves. They often believe that their propaganda is extraordinary because it has the backing of real strength, and that listeners will know to be wary, and that being wary is effective. How could they know that Japan's assessment of Britain is not as high as Britain's self-assessment, and that the assessment of Britain by the Japanese military in power is not as high as the assessment of Britain by Japanese moderates? Because of this discrepancy, Japan disregards Britain's desired effect from "plans" because they are merely plans. This is something that the self-respecting and self-deluded British tradition cannot imagine. This is a third, internal demon. It is these three demons that make the future outcome unpredictable and a great mystery. The sword to exorcise these demons is swift action! Arrived to be checked, but was pushed out of his standing place by a Japanese officer, as was Mr. MacKenzie. He was stripped naked by a Japanese sentry this morning when he passed through the British Concession. When he later returned to the British Concession, he was blocked by Japanese sentries and prevented from proceeding. He stood there for four hours until he walked to another entrance and was finally allowed to pass. The detention of Mr. Howard and the harassment of British men and women are common occurrences. The attitude of Japanese sentries towards the British is deteriorating daily. Many British people have been stripped naked. The British in this concession are extremely angry to learn that many British people have been stripped naked by Japanese sentries. The congestion at the seven sentry lines today is much worse than yesterday. However, the vegetable problem has improved since the vegetable boats were allowed to dock on the British concession's riverbank. (Associated Press, 15th)

(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources received here today, 50,000 Japanese are currently preparing to peacefully occupy the British concession in Tianjin today. These Japanese residents in Tianjin have decided to visit the graves of Japanese soldiers who died in the Boxer Rebellion. On Saturday and Sunday, 2,000 Japanese reservists will also march in formation in the British concession to visit the graves of Japanese soldiers. According to the Japanese news, the number of trains traveling between the Japanese concession in Tianjin, the Chinese area, and the British and French concessions has been reduced to one-fifth of normal due to Japanese restrictions. Normally, about 100,000 Chinese workers enter the British and French concessions every day, but only less than 2,000 were allowed to enter by noon yesterday. Japanese in Tianjin announced via loudspeakers that they were sorry for the slow inspection procedures, but this was unavoidable because they wanted to eliminate the communists who were based in the British concession.

Japanese Foreign Ministry Threatens Britain

Tokyo - Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma met with Foreign Minister Arita and Army Minister Itagaki yesterday to discuss the blockade of the Tianjin concessions and the entire issue of foreign concessions in China. It is reported that the Japanese government has decided to maintain the blockade of the Tianjin concessions until the authorities in North China unconditionally accept the decisions of the Japanese authorities. Army Minister Itagaki then visited the Emperor to report on the Tianjin issue. Yomiuri Shimbun "claims that foreign political figures believe that the Japanese authorities will soon take the same steps in Shanghai as in Tianjin. The newspaper firmly believes that the attitudes of Britain and France will make Japanese public opinion hostile to Britain and France. (Transocean News Agency, 15th)

(Tokyo) Today, the Foreign Ministry issued a premonitory warning, stating that if Britain attempts to retaliate against Japan for the Japanese military's blockade of the Tianjin concessions, Japan's attitude towards Britain will become even tougher. Furthermore, the Foreign Ministry news stated that if Britain takes retaliatory action in other areas, the situation in Tianjin will "worsen." According to recent news from London, the British Cabinet has ordered the British Board of Trade to study effective methods of retaliation. The Japanese Foreign Ministry recently stated that the actions in Tianjin were entirely directed against Britain. The Japanese Consul in Tianjin has declared to the American and French Consuls that their respective countries' interests will be respected. According to foreign observers here, Japan is trying to infringe on the treaty rights of third countries through a divide-and-conquer strategy to prevent a united front of Britain, the United States, and France. Furthermore, a Japanese naval spokesman stated that although the Japanese Navy did not directly participate in the blockade of the Tianjin concessions, it would support the Japanese authorities in Tianjin if necessary in the future. The spokesman also said that since the Kulangsu Municipal Council has rejected Japanese control of the concession, the residents there have experienced inconvenience due to the Municipal Council's "ineffective actions." He also said that foreigners in Chongqing and Chengdu should urge the Chinese authorities to remove defensive fortifications near foreign properties "to avoid friction." He also said that during recent Japanese bombing raids in Chongqing and Chengdu, Chinese anti-aircraft positions were located near foreign properties. (Associated Press, 15th)

British Cabinet Considers Retaliatory Measures

(London) Regarding the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the British government is currently awaiting a response from the Japanese side. Before receiving a response, the British side will not decide on any retaliatory policies. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the Tianjin incident yesterday, but the resolutions made remain strictly confidential. As for Britain's appeal to the United States to mediate the British-Japanese dispute, all parties believe it to be extremely important, as this type of development is unprecedented. It is reported that the British side proposed to Japan that the US Consul-General in Tianjin, Mr. Cortney, be a neutral figure in the two-member mediation committee. Although the Japanese side has already rejected the British proposal, the US government's agreement to have Mr. Cortney chair the mediation committee is extremely important. Furthermore, the British government is still in constant contact with the United States and France to obtain parallel or joint action to deal with Japan's strangulation strategy in the Chinese concessions. (Associated Press, 15th)

(London) After Japan implemented the blockade of the Tianjin and French concessions, it is considered here that the situation is extremely serious. The government is currently considering economic retaliatory measures, with the Board of Trade drafting tax rules to increase special taxes on Japanese goods and considering banning Japanese ships from docking at British ports in the Far East. The British and French governments exchanged views on these measures yesterday. At the same time, the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, presented a proposed solution. The retaliatory plan will be implemented as soon as a negative response is received from the Japanese side. London newspapers today published reports on the Tianjin situation with large front-page headlines. The "Daily Mail" expressed doubt about the hope of a British-Japanese compromise, believing that Japan will insist on the following three points: (1) Britain will no longer support Chinese currency; (2) Britain guarantees that it will no longer shelter "Communists and terrorists" in the concessions; (3) Britain must cooperate with Japan to establish a new order in China. All of this is difficult for the British government to accept and will be insisted upon by the Japanese side, so the hope of compromise is extremely slim. The newspaper is particularly optimistic about the economic retaliatory measures proposed by Britain, pointing out that Japan is an industrial country, and its few resources have been exhausted in the war against China. It will definitely not be able to withstand Britain's economic sanctions. The "Daily Express" strongly argues that if Britain and Australia act jointly, Japan will definitely be unable to cope. A "Chronicle News" warns the government not to accept Japan's demands, saying that this would show weakness to Japan and set a bad precedent, and Japan will successively interfere in other concessions in China. The "Financial Times" has learned that regarding retaliatory measures against Japan, the British Board of Trade is currently considering canceling the British-Japanese commercial agreement. (Transocean News Agency, 15th)

(London) According to well-informed sources, the British Cabinet considered the issue of imposing economic sanctions on Japan at a meeting yesterday. The measures may be directed at Japanese exports to Britain and the Commonwealth and India. The Board of Trade is considering changing the preferential tariffs enjoyed by Japan in British colonies. British authorities believe that effective economic measures can subdue Japan. (Transocean News Agency, 15th)

(London) After the British Cabinet meeting, a government spokesman declared that the British authorities in Tianjin would adopt a strong and unyielding attitude towards the Japanese blockade of the British concession. However, the British government side is inevitably somewhat uneasy. The Japanese Ambassador Toshio Shiratori's visit to Berlin is clearly a new attempt to pull Japan into the German-Italian military alliance. The government authorities anticipate that Japan will reject the third-party mediation action, so they are currently considering economic retaliatory measures. It is heard that the Foreign Office also advocates taking retaliatory measures, but the Board of Trade and the Treasury are strongly opposed. Treasury officials believe that the Tianjin matter is not worth making a big deal of and causing a major conflict between Britain and Japan. Therefore, the government is currently trying to create a united front with the governments of various regions and countries such as France and the United States. (Associated Press, 15th)

(London) Havas News Agency reporters learned that the British Cabinet discussed the situation in Tianjin, China, today and immediately decided to order the Board of Trade to draft a report outlining various measures that could be used to retaliate against Japan economically, so that they could be gradually and effectively implemented if the British concession in Tianjin was blockaded for too long. It is heard that the retaliatory measures include the following: (1) Imposing special taxes on Japanese ships anchored in British ports or restricting their right to anchor in these ports; (2) Imposing import duties and restricting the quantity of Japanese goods imported into British colonies; (3) Taking certain actions against Japanese currency. At this moment, the British government is awaiting a report from Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie to learn whether the Japanese government supports the actions of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin. People in the government believe that there is not much hope for easing the situation and that retaliatory measures must be implemented sooner or later. (Havas News Agency, 14th)

Britain and France to File Joint Protest

(Paris) According to political figures here, Prime Minister Daladier met with British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps yesterday to discuss the tense situation in Tianjin. It is learned that Britain and France will file a joint note to Japan to protest Japan's blockade of the Tianjin concessions and state that if Japan continues the blockade, the British authorities will not allow Japanese ships to sail to Singapore. (Transocean News Agency, 15th)

London is closely exchanging views with the United States and France on the policy of the Japanese military's blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, China. Dominion Affairs Minister Sir Inskip held a meeting this morning with the senior commissioners of the various Dominions in London to discuss the government's methods for restricting trade with Japan in all parts of the British Empire. The government authorities also scheduled to make a statement in the Lower House this afternoon. (Havas News Agency, 15th) The British and French governments informally exchanged views on the Tianjin situation this morning. According to sources here, France believes that the United States, France, and the United Kingdom

(Paris) The British and French governments informally exchanged views on the Tianjin situation this morning. Sources here say that France believes that the United States, France, and the United Kingdom are most concerned about the Chinese concessions, and it is necessary to maintain close contact with each other. It is solemnly stated that the best results can be obtained through parallel action. At the same time, it is recognized that the situation in Tianjin is quite subtle and that most of this matter should be left to the local authorities to negotiate. Policy authorities also hope that this matter will be resolved satisfactorily locally. (Reuters, 15th)

United States Denies Offering Mediation

(Washington) According to State Department officials yesterday, the US government authorities may consider rejecting the suggestion to establish a three-person committee, but the US side still believes that mediation can be effective. Furthermore, according to Secretary of State Hull, it is rumored that the British side intends to invite the US Consul-General in Tianjin to serve as chairman of the three-person committee, but he has not yet been able to confirm this news. He also said that US diplomats stationed in Tianjin are currently preparing all necessary measures to protect American residents there. The US State Department has not sent special instructions to the Tianjin Consulate General, but the authorities at the Consulate General have full authority to deal with everything to ensure the rights of American residents. Hull then declared that the US Far East Fleet Commander's yacht "Isabel" and the US ships "Trenton" and "Augusta" are currently docked at Qinhuangdao. As for the situation in Kulangsu, there is no progress. (Associated Press, 15th)

(Washington) The State Department today emphatically denied the claim that the United States has stepped in to mediate the Tianjin issue. Secretary of State Hull said in response to a question about this matter that he was unaware of any other country contacting the United States about mediation issues. The United States has decided to make all possible contributions to ease the overall situation. Hull was unwilling to say that the situations in Tianjin and Kulangsu were the same, but said that the two situations were definitely different. He also said that US representatives are paying attention to the status of Tianjin in every possible way and will protect the American people and their rights there within the permissible scope. The United States is currently submitting full and adequate representations to the Japanese side at any time to address specific incidents that the Japanese authorities should be aware of. The United States has previously ordered its shipping industry not to transport munitions or war materials into war zones, including Tianjin, and warned shipowners that if ships do not comply with this, they will bear the risk and responsibility. The United States has not had special exchanges of views with Tokyo regarding the Kulangsu International Settlement. (Reuters, 14th)

(Washington) US Ambassador to Japan Grew, who is currently in the country reporting on his duties, exchanged views with President Roosevelt on the Far East situation yesterday and also exchanged views with Secretary of State Hull all day long because of the increasingly tense relations between Japan and third countries in Tianjin. According to State Department officials, the United States is well aware that the harm suffered by American interests in Tianjin due to the Japanese blockade is no different from the impact on British and French interests. Secretary of State Hull stated at a press conference yesterday that he was paying full attention to the Far East issue. According to Hull, US representatives stationed in Tianjin and Tokyo "will do their utmost to seek a relaxation of the Tianjin situation." The US government is worried that Japanese demands may lead to regrettable unfortunate incidents. However, if the Japanese side attempts to take actions in Tianjin that undermine the treaty rights of foreigners, the United States will take strong retaliatory action. Hull also made some remarks on the Kulangsu incident, stating that he had instructed US representatives stationed in Tokyo to warn Americans not to undermine the rights of Americans in that area. From this, it can be seen that Hull believes that the situation in Tianjin is the same as the situation in Kulangsu. (Associated Press, 15th)

British and French Newspapers Unanimously Criticize

(London) Regarding the Japanese blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the newspapers here unanimously demanded strong action. However, the "Financial News" stated that it was quite difficult to implement economic sanctions against Japan, implying that the authorities should act cautiously. The "Manchester Guardian" still said that compromise was hopeful, and Japan might not oppose the arbitration method proposed by Britain. The "Financial Times" believed that the situation in Tianjin was very serious. "As a result of Japan's blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, it has become necessary for Britain to take economic retaliatory measures. The Board of Trade is considering it from an economic and commercial standpoint. If Japan insists on its own way and adheres to its views, Britain will adopt two retaliatory measures: (1) Large-scale economic retaliation; (2) Abolishing the British-Japanese commercial agreement and canceling the preferential treatment of Japanese goods in the British Empire market." The British government attaches great importance to this matter and is currently maintaining close contact with the French and American governments. In addition, the "Daily Express" stated, "Japan's war against China has not gained any benefits or honor. This decision clearly wants to achieve a victory in diplomacy to cover up its military failures." (Havas News Agency, 15th)

(London) British newspapers continued to comment on Japan's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin today. Excerpts from the opinions of three London newspapers are quoted below to show the general sentiment in Britain. The Daily Express claimed that Japan's war against China had gained neither benefits nor honor, and now it hoped to cover up its military failure with a diplomatic victory. The Tianjin incident raised the entire issue of our concessions in China. We should be prepared to hand over the concessions, but we must hand over the concessions to the Chinese, not the Japanese. We can concede to the landlords, but not to the thieves. The Daily News claimed that Japan was simply using the case of the four Chinese involved in the assassination of Cheng as an excuse to create an incident to destroy British interests in the Far East and wipe out British prestige. The Financial News claimed that the British concession in Tianjin was now blockaded, and the entire question of how far Britain was prepared to protect its Far East interests had arisen. The difficulties of taking action within the economic sphere seemed unavoidable. Britain needed the cooperation of India, Australia, and the United States. However, economic sanctions must ultimately be supported by force. The policy we have adopted in the past eight years to deal with Japanese aggression seems to indicate that Britain still hopes to solve this problem with delaying tactics alone, but Japan today seems to force us to make a decision. We can only prepare to maintain the long shipping lanes of its empire and commerce, or we must shorten them. Apart from this, there is no third way. (Reuters, 15th)

(Paris) French newspapers all regard the simultaneous occurrence of Japan's sudden action in Tianjin and the arrival of British Foreign Office representative Sterndale in Moscow as having great significance. The newspaper Le Temps carried the comments of right-wing member of parliament M. Gracos, who said that he was deeply impressed by this coincidence and believed that since Germany and Italy could not obtain Japan's consent to cooperate with the navy in the Mediterranean, they pressured Japan to strike at least during the critical period of European negotiations. Le Figaro said that Japan's actions in Tianjin had four motives: (1) To threaten Britain when Sterndale went to Moscow; (2) Although the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance has nothing to do with Japan, Japan is using the Tianjin action as a response to the three-nation alliance; (3) Obedience to German instigation; (4) To divert the attention of the people from the war in China. L'Humanité said that the Japanese government is working for the Axis powers and wants to prevent the realization of a peace front by means of terror and threats. L'Œuvre carried the comments of Mrs. Taboui, who said that if Britain stood firm and refused to give in, the blockade of the Tianjin concession would not need to be overemphasized in her view, because Japan was just using this to test Britain's strength in order to take action in Shanghai. (Reuters, 15th)

(Paris) In the "Intransigeant," Philibert Verrine published an editorial in the newspaper yesterday, explaining France's point of view on the situation in Tianjin, declaring that the evolution of the situation in Tianjin was by no means an isolated event, but a new impetus on the international stage. Japan is now using the request for the extradition of four Chinese as an excuse to launch anti-British demonstrations, with the aim of increasing Britain's troubles in the Far East and thus providing assistance to Japan's European allies. "Paris-Soir" believes that the United States, Britain, and France do not want the Tianjin incident to develop into a serious situation and will seek a solution with Japan within the realm of possibility. The newspaper hints that the attention of Western countries is still focused on the European situation, and Paris believes that Japan's actions in Tianjin will promote the early conclusion of the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance, as Moscow must be more enthusiastic about concluding an agreement because of Japan's recent attitude. (Transocean News Agency, 15th)

The Shanghai newspaper North China Daily News carried an editorial yesterday, discussing the Tianjin blockade, which stated, "Tokyo has clearly realized that the end of the war against China, even today, is as elusive as it was at the beginning of the war, and that it will take another two or three years to defeat China's resistance. At the same time, the position of the Japanese military is very embarrassing, so it has to take action to show that the lives and money lost in the war have not been thrown into a void. Therefore, it is clamoring and acting outrageously in foreign concessions in China in order to divert the attention of the Japanese people and prevent them from focusing their attention on the magnificent war, which has lasted for a long time, and the future of the Japanese army in China is still a long and terrible struggle. Even though the Japanese army has fought to this day, it is still uncertain whether it can obtain the victory that it hoped for when it began this very tragic adventure."

German Public Opinion Intentionally Sides with Japan

(Berlin) The situation in Tianjin, China, has recently been commented on by the newspapers here, all of which say that this is a "contest" between Britain and Japan. The "Attack News" stated that "Britain and France only know how to be selfish and constantly obstruct Japan's progress in China. Japan must fight with Britain and France in order to complete its plans in China." (Havas News Agency, 15th)

(Berlin) The blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, by the Japanese military has recently been commented on by the newspapers, all of which are attacking Britain. The "Westphalian Local Daily" joked that "the British concession is now surrounded by barbed wire, which is no different from a quarantined area for epidemics. The British should not be surprised by this. Those British people, who regard themselves as the masters of the world in the British concessions everywhere in China, are completely ignorant of the new developments in the Far East, which is narrow-minded and arrogant." The "Essen National Daily" (the organ of Air Minister General Göring) stated, "Britain is a defeated imperialist country," and it is not worth using all its strength in a corner of the Far East. "For Japan's sake, there is no reason to take action based on this view, because it would take great strength for Japan to compete with Britain at this moment, which is not worth it. If it can be delayed slightly, it can achieve twice the result with half the effort." In short, the British concessions in China are not assets, but liabilities. (Havas News Agency, 15th)

### The Situation in Tianjin Extremely Tense. Chamberlain Expresses Important Views. Acknowledges Japanese Demands Sufficient to Cause Significant Political Issues. British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, Ordered to Negotiate with Japan. British Side Maintaining Close Contact with the United States and France. Kulangsu Also Blockaded by Japanese Troops.

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that the British military authorities in Tianjin, in light of the Japanese blockade, are taking various precautions to maintain order within the concession. The British escort vessel HMS Lowestoft (990 tons) is currently docked alongside the British concession on the river. Today, due to the illness of opposition leader Attlee, Labour Party leader Greenwood spoke on his behalf to inquire about the situation in Tianjin. The Prime Minister responded that the blockade of the foreign concessions in Tianjin began at 6:00 AM on June 14th. Britons and other foreigners entering and leaving the concessions are being stopped and searched at roadblocks. It is understood that food is still permitted to be brought into the concessions, but prices appear to be trending upwards. Britons traveling along the Bai River are also being subjected to interference. British Ambassador to Tokyo, Sir Robert Craigie, has raised the matter with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and has been ordered to indicate to the Japanese government the danger of provocative actions by the Japanese authorities in Tianjin, fearing that they may lead to regrettable incidents. Sir Robert has also asked Arita to note that a certain spokesman for the Japanese side in Tianjin has stated that the current issue in dispute cannot be resolved even if the British authorities hand over the four defendants sought by the Japanese. The purpose of the blockade is to obtain a broader form of cooperation from the British authorities in China. The implications are indeed serious. If these words represent the views of the North China authorities, then the Japanese are clearly plotting incidents to achieve demands that are broader and more far-reaching than the extradition of the four individuals. Such demands will raise significant policy issues involving other major powers beyond just Great Britain. The British government is currently maintaining the closest possible contact with the French government. At the same time, the British government is considering the overall situation arising from the Japanese refusal to accept the recommendations of the proposed investigative committee and the continued blockade of the concessions. After the Prime Minister finished his answer, several more members of parliament raised questions. Labour Party leader Henderson asked whether the government intends to invoke Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty, which stipulates that the signatory nations should fully consult with each other when a situation arises that violates the principles of the treaty. The Prime Minister replied that the overall situation is clearly very serious and the British government is currently considering all aspects. As for what action we will decide to take, it is not yet possible to inform you at this time. Conservative MP Milner asked whether the Prime Minister would consider notifying the Japanese government that if they do not lift the blockade within 24 hours, the British government will declare the abrogation of the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Treaty. The Prime Minister replied that he could not add anything to what he had just stated. Opposition Liberal Party MP Manderville proposed convening a special meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council to consider what steps could be taken to solemnly express the international nature of this case. The Prime Minister reiterated that he could not yet predict what steps the government might decide to take. (Reuters, 15th)

(Tokyo) According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Japanese authorities in North China have decided to continue isolating the British and French concessions in Tianjin until the United Kingdom drastically revises its pro-Chiang and anti-Japanese attitude. Any incomplete compromises will be rejected. It is reported that the above decision was adopted by the military and political representatives of Japan stationed in North China after a three-day meeting, which concluded yesterday. (Reuters, 15th)

(Xiamen) The Japanese have begun to blockade Kulangsu. Three Japanese warships are currently preventing various supplies from entering from the mainland, causing the 50,000 residents of the Kulangsu International Settlement to face a perilous situation. Japanese newspapers report that matches, coke, and vegetables are all prohibited from being transported to Kulangsu. According to a Japanese spokesman, the Japanese intention is to make the Kulangsu Municipal Council aware of Japan's demands. It is surprising that this blockade action has suddenly occurred, as the Japanese authorities recently declared their willingness to cooperate with the Municipal Council to suppress anti-Japanese activities. (Reuters, 15th)

(Hong Kong) According to today's Japanese report from Xiamen, the Japanese are now planning to take immediate action against the Asiatic Petroleum Company's ship "Yangtaishan." It is reported that the reason for the blockade of Kulangsu is that this ship was smuggling people and food from the mainland to Kulangsu. (Associated Press, 15th)

(Hong Kong) The situation in Kulangsu is said to be becoming tense again. The reason is that the Japanese have again made various demands on the Municipal Council for the management of the concession. At the same time, the Japanese Navy is said to have blockaded Kulangsu, resulting in severe food shortages. It is reported that the Kulangsu Municipal Council has lodged a very strong protest against this blockade. According to observations here, negotiations between the Kulangsu Municipal Council and the Japanese side have broken down. Therefore, apart from taking military action against the American, British, and French Marines on the island, the only option for the Japanese is to lower their demands. (Associated Press, 15th)

(Tokyo) Navy Ministry spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa stated today at a press conference that the Kulangsu incident has not yet been resolved. The Japanese authorities are determined to seek a peaceful resolution to this issue, but negotiations have reached a stalemate because third countries and the Kulangsu Municipal Council continue to maintain a stubborn attitude and refuse to acknowledge the current situation. The Municipal Council is poorly organized and lacks the ability to maintain peace and order within the concession. The local Japanese authorities have no choice but to send marines ashore until peace and order are fully maintained. The Japanese authorities have also suspended traffic between Kulangsu and the mainland to prevent unlawful elements from sneaking back and forth. (Reuters, 15th)

A Glimpse of Yesterday's Tense Situation

(Tianjin) Today is the second day of the Japanese blockade of the foreign concessions in Tianjin. There have been no serious developments in the concessions. The important events of today are as follows: (1) Agitators incited two thousand Chinese to rush into the British concession defense line, but their plan failed. (2) Police in the former German concession distributed inflammatory leaflets. (3) Several foreign ships were stopped and searched. The food supply problem in the concessions is gradually becoming serious. Although the Japanese claim to allow food to be freely transported into the concessions, the amount of vegetables, meat, and milk transported in the past two days has been minimal. There is almost nothing for sale in the vegetable markets. Some are engaging in monopolistic hoarding, with prices of various goods rising by 20% to 70%. However, the price of canned food remains the same. A Reuters reporter heard from eyewitnesses that a Chinese man pushed a cart full of vegetables and stopped near an unguarded barbed wire fence, throwing the vegetables, along with the baskets, over the obstacle. Residents inside the concession then scrambled for them. In the early morning, two thousand Chinese lined up outside the British concession, waiting for Japanese soldiers to inspect them so that they could enter the British concession along Racecourse Road. Then agitators incited them to rush into the concession's defense line. At this time, a British light infantry unit, hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene with machine guns, deploying in a defensive formation with fixed bayonets. The crowd showed no intention of rushing into the concession. The agitators could do nothing. The crowd waited until 3:00 PM, but the inspection was still not completed, and there was no legitimate opportunity to enter the concession, so they dispersed. The British infantry also withdrew at 3:30 PM. Uniformed Chinese police in the former German concession openly participated in the distribution of inflammatory texts. Several leaflets were blown by the wind into the British concession. Colored leaflets were posted outside the British and French concessions, inciting the public to oppose the concessions. The slogans were as follows: (1) All Chinese should immediately leave the British and French concessions. (2) The British concession is a haven for communists. (3) Recovering the concessions will end the chaos. Today, among the foreign ships stopped and searched by the Japanese, one was the Navy, flying the Norwegian flag. This ship left Tianjin in the early morning, intending to go to Tanggu, but was stopped at the Dalian Steamship Company pier. It was released only after a thorough inspection. Later, two more barges were also stopped at the same location. The inspectors wanted to unpack the cargo for inspection, but the boatmen strongly objected, saying that the goods were sealed by customs and could not be opened. The two sides were deadlocked. Because the goods belonged to German merchants, the boatmen appealed to the German merchants and asked for help from the German consul in Tianjin. At the same time, customs also reported the detention of the ships and the dismantling of the packages for inspection to the inspectors. As a result, the two barges were finally released. The French ship Taishenghang, chartered by Jardine Matheson, arrived in Tianjin this afternoon (docked at the Dalian Steamship Company pier awaiting inspection, which took 15 minutes to complete). According to the crew, the Japanese inspectors were still polite. This ship was the first foreign ship to arrive in Tianjin after the blockade. Although no important incidents occurred yesterday, it was heard that many foreigners were humiliated. Several British expatriates were paid special attention to and were detained for detailed questioning. Some cars were damaged, causing delays of one hour. Several British expatriates were forced to take off their shoes and socks. It is said that the Japanese authorities are also creating difficulties for Japanese people who want to enter the foreign concessions, but German expatriates are treated more leniently. However, at least two German women were inspected. A Russian woman, although she showed a certificate of registration from the local anti-communist committee, was still subject to inspection, but it was done by a woman and she was not stripped. Some British people were also forced to wait for inspection and release in the same place as the Chinese. The inspection was extremely slow, and pedestrians suffered from it. (Reuters, 15th)

(Hong Kong) According to Japanese news, at 12:30 PM today, 30 British soldiers, accompanied by 20 Chinese police, drove in three trucks to the border between the British concession and the First Special District and set up obstacles and added sentry posts. The posts were only a few meters away from the Japanese sentry posts. A light machine gun was also added near the British sentry post, with its muzzle aimed at the Japanese sentry post. At 2:05 PM, another 30 British regular soldiers and 20 Chinese police arrived, carrying 11 light and heavy machine guns. At 4:00 PM, three Japanese tanks rushed to the vicinity of the Japanese sentry post. An hour and a half later, the British troops withdrew, and the machine guns were also taken away. The time was 5:20 PM. Within these five hours this afternoon, the situation in Tianjin was very tense. (Dispatch, 15th)

(Tianjin) All British expatriates here were extremely angry today upon reading the notice issued by the British consulate regarding several British expatriates being "forced to remove their shoes and socks" by Japanese sentries. The initial news was that the Japanese sentries implementing the blockade of the British and French concessions had forced British expatriates to remove their shoes and socks during inspection. At the same time, the Japanese blockade around the British and French concessions was tighter today than yesterday, making the seven entrances to the concessions even more crowded. This morning, the food supply situation was slightly eased as boats loaded with vegetables arrived off the Bund of the British concession. British man Melville, employed by the Fox Film Corporation, was arrested by Japanese troops yesterday while filming Japanese inspection operations. He is still being detained by the Japanese side this morning. The British authorities are making efforts to negotiate and demand his release. (Associated Press, 15th)

Two Thousand Vagrants Plot to Rush the Concession

(Tianjin) Since the Japanese blockade of the concessions, no unfortunate incidents have occurred due to the firm and unyielding attitude of the British. Today, more than two thousand Chinese gathered at the Racecourse Road intersection, apparently intending to rush into the concession and demonstrate under the direction of the Japanese. At this time, the British army immediately reinforced the area, setting up machine guns, and the bayonets on the rifles were also fixed, flashing brightly. Therefore, these Chinese, who were being used by others, did not dare to take any action. At 3:00 PM, they ignored the instigations of plainclothes agitators and scattered like birds and beasts. According to British military officers, these plainclothes personnel were either Japanese or Koreans. There were two incidents of British people being humiliated by Japanese sentries: (1) Mr. Howarth was struck with the scabbard of a bayonet by a Japanese officer at the Racecourse Road intersection. Fortunately, he was not injured. Mr. Howarth was standing in the same

On the Question of Resolute Resistance

### President Kong's Opinion

(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) The War of Resistance has now lasted for two years. As we recall the evolution of the domestic and international situation over the past two years and look forward to the future of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, we firmly believe that Japan will be forced to change its national policy one day, and we are confident of achieving final victory. Now, please allow me to list a few of the most prominent facts for the consideration of our compatriots. (1) In the military sphere, our preparations for national defense and military affairs are not as thorough as those of the Japanese. This is an undeniable fact. However, judging from the situation of the battles over the past two years, it is sufficient to prove that we are growing stronger as we fight, while the Japanese are growing weaker. Regardless of the use of strategy and tactics, the replenishment of personnel, or the supply of equipment, we have made considerable progress. The results of successive battles have also proven that the Japanese have neither the certainty of victory nor the ability to defend. (2) In the diplomatic sphere, Japan's policy of aggression is not only directed at China but at the entire world. Therefore, our resistance against Japan is nothing less than acting as a defense team for justice throughout the world and bolstering the strength of the peace front. As a result, the sympathy and assistance of various countries for us is becoming increasingly active. In the recent resolution of the League of Nations Executive Council, it has been clearly stated that "Japan is an aggressor state." This is a major step forward in international diplomacy. Now that the forces of world peace are gradually rising, Japan's international relations are becoming increasingly isolated. (3) In the economic sphere, our greatest success in the economic sphere has been the victory in the currency war. Since March of last year, when the Japanese established the "Pseudo-United Reserve Bank" in North China and issued counterfeit currency in an attempt to seize our foreign exchange reserves and undermine the credit of our legal currency, we have implemented foreign exchange controls in order to prevent the Japanese plot. For more than a year, the results have been remarkable. Seeing that their plans were not succeeding, the Japanese used various means to undermine our legal currency policy, first suppressing the price of our legal currency in their occupied areas, and then simply banning the circulation of our legal currency on the market. However, they do not know that our legal currency is sufficiently backed and has outstanding credit. Now that our foreign exchange rate has been adjusted, the Japanese have no more tricks to play. Another hidden crisis lurking on the Japanese side in the economic sphere is, first, the stagnation of domestic production, and second, the increase in the suffering of the people. Due to the unlimited expansion of the military-industrial complex, all domestic capital and labor are absorbed, while imports of raw materials are reduced, and the production volume of ordinary industries is greatly reduced. As a result, export trade suffers extremely adverse effects. As for agricultural production, it has always been very poor, and now it is even more declining. Last year, the production of all rice, silkworms, and lotus roots was greatly reduced. As for the reasons for the increased suffering of the Japanese people, they are mostly due to the increased burden and the soaring prices. According to reliable estimates, the Japanese have actually spent more than 11.99 billion yuan in military expenses in the first year and a half of the invasion of China. No matter how cleverly Japanese financiers apply this huge amount of military expenses, the result will be that it will eventually be extracted from the Japanese people. How can the people of a small country of tens of millions bear such a huge war expenditure every year? In addition, production is declining, the value of the currency is falling, and the prices of daily necessities are soaring, resulting in a year-round of hard work and not enough to eat. As a result, the anti-war movement is lurking and growing, with a great potential for explosion. Because the Japanese have repeatedly tried all kinds of conspiracies and strategies without success, they have resorted to ulterior motives, deliberately creating all kinds of atmosphere, attempting to alienate our domestic unity and disperse our strength to resist the war, and even concocting many provocative rumors. Our War of Resistance is a necessary action to seek survival and self-preservation for the nation. Chairman Chiang has inherited the legacy of Sun Yat-sen, and based on the demands of the entire people, he leads the War of Resistance and implements national policy. Government colleagues and the people of the entire country, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, are united in sincerity, and will become more resilient over time. It is seen that the strength of unity will be enhanced, and the War of Resistance will be victorious. National reconstruction will be successful, and both will fulfill their missions in this kind of sincere inspiration. O patriotic compatriots, let us strengthen our faith, concentrate our strength, and move toward this common goal! (Dispatch, 15th)

Kunming-Xufu Highway Still Difficult to Travel

(Chongqing) According to foreign reports, the new highway between Kunming and Xufu will take at least five more months to complete. Some of this road has been built, and there was talk of opening it soon, but a foreign engineer who attempted to drive a truck along this road has had to abandon this attempt. According to him, many rivers do not have bridges, and he was only able to proceed by building temporary crossing bridges himself. The road construction along the way is not perfect. He has traveled more than two-thirds of the entire journey, but more than 100 kilometers in the middle are still under construction, so he had to stop the trip. This highway is very important in China's current transportation situation and can alleviate the congestion of the Chongqing-Guizhou-Kunming highway. It should be operated with greater effort. Therefore, foreign businesses were somewhat disappointed to hear this news. (Reuters, 15th)

National Government Officially Commends Cheng Ruhuan

Capital of Finland. "Uusi Suomi", the organ of Foreign Minister Erkko, published an article today, stating: "We do not need any guarantees from other countries now. If anyone wants to impose a guarantee on our country, it will be regarded as a threat, and we will rise up to defend our independence. In short, no matter which country attempts to force a guarantee on us, its actions are obviously contrary to peace, and are sufficient to cause the issue of aggression. It also seems that there is a lack of clear understanding of national sovereignty. As for our country's fortification of the Åland Islands, the Soviet Union has expressed opposition. Judging from its original intention, it must be for the sake of peace, and it probably wants to cause difficulties for our country's neutral position." (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Capital of Finland. The main organ of the Soviet government, Pravda, insisted yesterday that before the conclusion of a triangular anti-aggression alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the Baltic countries should accept the Soviet Union's guarantee. Today, the organ of Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko published an article in reply, stating that giving guarantees to countries that do not want to receive them and are prepared to defend themselves is an unfriendly action. If efforts are made to force a guarantee, it is no different from aggression and will lead to disputes regarding sovereignty. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

Only with autonomy can there be peace. I have come to Turkey this time to discuss international issues related to the Balkan Entente countries with the Turkish authorities. Although the Balkan Entente countries have shown signs of division in their opinions in the past few weeks, a quiet atmosphere has always existed. The economic treaty with Germany is rumored to be due to pressure from Germany, but this is not true. It should be known that Romanian people welcome the mutual development of economic relations between the two countries." (Haitong dispatch, 15th)

German Political Circles Mock Turkey

Berlin. Regarding Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's visit to Turkey, political circles here are paying close attention to it. The general view is that "Turkey has broken the basic principles of the Balkan Entente countries after concluding the Anglo-Turkish agreement. Now, France is using the Sanjak region as bait to lure it into abandoning its independent policy and joining the encirclement of the German-Italian camp. The official report published after Foreign Minister Gafencu's talks in the Turkish capital has not calmed the situation of Turkey disrupting the Balkan policy. The local Berlin newspaper declared that Turkey is now transferring its responsibility to protect the Dardanelles to Britain." (Haitong dispatch, 15th)

### International Labor Conference, Speeches by Chinese and American Representatives, Proposal to Reduce Working Hours Postponed, Support for Holding World Economic Conference

(Geneva) The International Labor Conference met this afternoon. The first speaker was Mr. Harriman, the US employer representative, who said that the way to save today's turbulent world is nothing more than the following: 1. Supply various raw materials produced by certain countries to "poor countries" for them to utilize and develop the exchange of raw materials; 2. Stabilize the exchange rates of various countries; 3. Reduce tariff barriers; 4. Hold an international conference and sign a new treaty of peace based on good intentions. Li Pingheng, the Chinese government representative, then spoke, expressing his support for US President Roosevelt's proposal to hold a world economic conference, and delivered a moving speech on the situation in the Far East. The conference then discussed the proposal to reduce working hours in various industries, and passed a motion to postpone the discussion by a vote of 90 to 2. The meeting was then adjourned. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

(Geneva) The International Labor Conference met this morning. Li Pingheng, the Chinese government representative, delivered a moving speech, the gist of which was: "China currently has only two paths to follow: either surrender or resist. Based on our duty, we have now decided to resist to the end." He also reviewed the international situation in the past year, saying, "A country here can lose its independence without even a day. Concessions made to aggressor nations, no matter how broad the scope of the concessions, are definitely not enough to maintain peace. The experience of the past few years has already shown this to the world. It is said that war can be localized, but this is just wishful thinking. It is also wrong to abandon the collective security system. The Chinese people are now suffering the pain of modern warfare. This resistance is not only for their survival and freedom, but also for peace, justice, and international law. Peace, justice, and international law are what all civilized countries in the world should strive to achieve with all their strength. Although our country has been resisting for 23 months, its social progress, economic development, and other reconstruction work have not been suspended due to the war. It is also engaged in great work in the fields of economy, transportation, and communications. At this time, countries that supply Japan with military equipment are in fact hindering their own interests. Since 1937, Japan's exports to China have increased year by year, while the exports of the United States, Germany, Britain, and the Dutch East Indies to China have gradually decreased. The United States, which was originally the top country in trade with China, has been replaced by Japan." (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### French Tunisia Restricts Japanese Goods

Tunis, French Tunisia, North Africa. The authorities have issued an order stipulating that all goods imported from Japan, with the exception of raw silk and camphor, must be accompanied by a special certificate signed by the Commercial Counselor of the French Embassy in Japan or a French Consul before they can be allowed to enter. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has managed foreign exchange very strictly. France's trade with Japan has changed from a trade surplus to a trade deficit. The government has implemented a consular visa system in its headquarters and various territories to remedy this. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Hitler Plans to Deliver Important Speech, Göbbels Viciously Attacks Britain During Launch of New Cruiser

(Berlin) According to well-informed sources here, Germany's fifth 10,000-ton cruiser will be launched in early July. At that time, Führer Hitler will deliver an important speech on the international situation, informing the people of the true crisis facing Germany and warning Britain to make it clear about its responsibilities. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

(Berlin) German Propaganda Minister Göbbels gave a speech to 15,000 workers at a sports field today, in which he launched a major attack on Chamberlain and Britain, saying that the reason why the four powers signed the Munich Agreement last September was "purely because Chamberlain was in our grasp and had to come... As for now, we are at a critical moment in history. A slight mistake is enough to lead to unexpected disasters." He also said, "The British nation is a nation of contradictions. On Sundays, the British can go to church, but at the same time they can bomb Arabs and not think it's wrong. We have now exposed this immoral aspect of the British. We are very dissatisfied with the current situation. The one who tied the bell must untie it. This should be done by the originator of this situation." (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)

It is said that Mr. Rundstedt is waiting in Berlin for the announcement of his appointment as commander of the new German army in the east. General Wöhler, who previously assisted in the occupation of Czechoslovakia, has reportedly arrived in Bratislava. The 28th, 8th, and 31st Infantry Divisions, the 4th Tank Division, and the 118th Heavy Artillery Division are reportedly deployed near Mährisch-Ostrau. The 3rd Tank Division has arrived near Olmütz. The 131st and 132nd Infantry Divisions have moved to eastern Slovakia near the Polish border. The 65th Fighter Squadron and a mountain artillery regiment are stationed near Poprad. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

(Berlin) According to well-informed sources, there are new military actions in western Slovakia. However, German newspapers here have attacked the British propaganda that Hitler will instigate a coup in Slovakia. It is heard that the German army has begun to occupy strategic locations on the Moravia-to-Slovakia highway. Also, the German authorities absolutely deny that they will cause a coup in Slovakia. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)

Prague. Regarding the assassination of a German police officer in Kladno, northwestern Bohemia, on June 8, a Czech woman has been arrested here today on suspicion of being an accomplice in the case and the identity of the murderer is known. After the murder, Reinhard Heydrich, the Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, has taken strict measures such as fining and disarming the Czech police in Kladno. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

German troops have been passing through various major roads leading northwest from the Slovak territory and concentrating in the Carpathian passes of Jablonica and Dukla. However, Poland stated that if Polish territory is invaded by Germany, it will definitely respond with force. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)

(Paris) Although the truth about the German troop movements in Slovakia is still unknown, it has caused great concern in Warsaw, Paris, and London. If the rumors are true, Germany can attack Poland's Upper Silesian industrial area at any time. Once the war breaks out, Germany will be able to occupy or destroy Poland's main lifeline institutions and force Poland to rely on military assistance from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)

(London) According to the Times correspondent in Prague, the arrival of Heinrich Himmler, the head of the German secret police, in Prague has increased the feeling that an accident may occur. The incidents of Germans and Czechs being killed in Kladno and Nachod recently have given people the feeling that some kind of change will occur soon. Some Czechs believe that the change in the protectorate system will be followed by German action in Slovakia. Germany has already placed a garrison in Slovakia, and in recent weeks has concentrated troops in northeastern Moravia near the Slovak border. Germany can seize Slovakia without having to mobilize large numbers of troops from within the country. The correspondent also listed the following two events as signs that Germany intends to take some action in the next few days: 1. All train locomotives in Pardubice and Prague have been ordered to be fired up and ready to depart within the next two days; 2. All non-military traffic will be suspended on the roads from Brno to Olmütz and Jihlava during the same period. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### New Victory for Guangxi Province's Resistance War: New Defense Lines Redefined for the West River and Southern Route; Third Conscription Adds 50,000 to the Ranks

Wuzhou dispatch: Japanese troops invading Guangdong have repeatedly attempted to enter Guangxi Province via the West River and Southern Route. However, on the West River front, they were met with a head-on blow from the Chinese army. The Japanese troops could only linger downstream of Sanshui and could not advance. Along the Southern Route coastline, Japanese warships seemed to have some apprehension and also hesitated at the shore, unable to land. However, the Guangxi authorities have made considerable efforts and progress in defense work, troop training, equipment replenishment, and public organization. According to a military expert, the strength of Guangxi's resistance war before January of this year, compared to after January, is estimated to have increased at least tenfold. The Japanese army failed to capture Guangxi Province in the first half of this year, and it will be even more difficult for them to succeed in the future. Xia Wei, the commander of the Guangxi XX Army, was promoted to commander-in-chief of the XX Group Army and is in charge of military affairs on both the West River and Southern Route fronts. He has newly equipped the defense areas. On the West River front, from Zhaoqing, going upstream to Wuzhou, there are three defense lines. On the Southern Route front, from the Leizhou Peninsula, through Suixi, Lianjiang, Huazhou, Maoming, to Yulin and Luchuan, and from Beihai, through Hepu, Qin County, Lingshan, to Nanning, there are also three defense lines. Each defense line is stationed with a considerable number of regular troops, cooperating with local militia and guerrillas, making the defense exceptionally tight.

During the early stages of the resistance war, Guangxi Province originally had seven divisions of active-duty troops. In addition to transferring all of them north, it also slightly mobilized two batches of conscripts, totaling 500,000 men. Of these 500,000 conscripts, 350,000 were transferred to the Northeast war zones for replenishment, and 150,000 remained in Guangxi for internal training. Therefore, Guangxi Province often maintained seven divisions of active-duty troops internally. After the extension of the defense lines, they were distributed to the West River and Southern Route. From June 1st, the Guangxi Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government jointly issued an order to carry out the third conscription plan, conscripting an average of 500 men from each county, totaling 50,000 men. Adding the previous numbers, there are 200,000 regular troops in the province, not including the self-defense corps, guerrillas, and special units. In addition to the above-mentioned various troops, there are also volunteer student soldiers. There are currently as many as six regiments trained, all of whom are middle school and above students. These troops are of excellent quality and high knowledge. Their training subjects are arranged according to the students' wishes. Some are trained as mechanized elite troops, while the rest are incorporated into political work groups, battlefield propaganda groups, and battlefield service groups.

Shuyang Military and Civilians Recover the County Seat

Many Japanese and Puppet Troops Killed

Shuyang dispatch: Since Shuyang fell, the county magistrate, Xia Dingwen, moved the county's standing troops and police brigade to the countryside, and reorganized the standing troops in each district of the county, and reorganized the armed masses in each district. As a result, the entire county's military force was completely renewed. On the 3rd of this month, at dawn, Magistrate Xia personally led the county's standing troops, self-defense forces in various districts, and armed masses, totaling more than a thousand people, to besiege Shuyang County. They first made arrangements on the night of the 2nd, and launched at 2:00 AM. The brave county standing troops and the masses in various districts all advanced bravely. The Japanese and puppet troops in the city were awakened from their dreams by the dense artillery fire of the standing troops and others. In temporary panic, they fired cannons from the city walls towards the outside. The Chinese military and civilians were familiar with the terrain and easy to hide. After fierce fighting with the Japanese and puppet troops for seven hours, they briefly rested. At about 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, Magistrate Xia selected brave troops to launch another fierce attack on the city. They attacked from all sides simultaneously and used mortars for cover. They broke through the city walls and poured into the city at 5:00 PM. Street fighting broke out with the Japanese and puppet troops. The Chinese troops surged forward and threw hand grenades at the Japanese and puppet troops. The Japanese and puppet troops were blown up and wounded, with corpses strewn on the streets. The remaining Japanese and puppet troops could not hold on and mostly climbed onto civilian houses to resist stubbornly. The Chinese troops then surrounded, searched, and annihilated them. Many Japanese and puppet troops were killed in this battle, but detailed statistics have not yet been made. There were also heroic sacrifices on the Chinese side, but the county seat has been recovered by the Chinese military and civilians.

### Dazhi Bus Attacked on the Changshu Section of the Shanghai-Nanjing Road

Changshu dispatch: The Dazhi Bus, operated by the Japanese, travels on the Shanghai-Nanjing Road, carrying goods and passengers. At 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, it departed from Shanghai with a United Company truck and was attacked in the Bai Mao Tai Yu Tan area of Changshu. None of the passenger or cargo vehicles escaped unscathed. The United Company truck was carrying eight pieces of tin foil from the newly opened Guangtai Tin Foil Shop in Changshu, worth 3,000 yuan, all of which were looted. The Dazhi Bus was also burned. Passengers had to transfer to an empty United Company truck to Changshu. Passengers on the Shanghai-Nanjing Road are now very cautious.

### Suzhou Transportation Industry Under Japanese Control: "Huaxing" Establishes Branch in Suzhou

Suzhou dispatch: Since the fall of this city, the transportation industry has developed abnormally. The establishment of various transportation companies is almost ubiquitous. On the 8th of this month, the puppet county government, under the orders of the Japanese, jointly governed the county's transportation. All transportation companies established in the county are required to re-apply to the puppet county government for registration before the 15th. After being approved by the Japanese, the puppet county government will issue a registration certificate before they can officially operate. It is said that the Japanese military's control of transportation was initiated because the business of the transportation companies run by Japanese merchants was surpassed by the companies run by Chinese. Therefore, the Japanese merchants repeatedly requested the Japanese military to take this measure.

"Huaxing Bank" has recently established branches in important cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to absorb legal tender and manipulate finance. It is said that a "Huaxing" branch will also be established in this port this month. Its address has been decided to be the original site of Jiangsu Bank on Guanqian Street. A local named Xu Xun Gong has been recommended by the puppet authorities to serve as the branch manager. (Note: Xu was formerly the manager of the Avenue Joffre branch of Continental Bank in Shanghai. When the puppet provincial government was established, the preparation of the local bank failed.) It is said that all personnel and start-up procedures have now been decided. After the establishment of this branch, Suzhou's finance will probably be in danger.

Zhang Gang's Net Under the Pole Vault Bar, Replacing the Sandpit

American Veteran Coach's Invention, Records Can Reach Sixteen Feet

Los Angeles News: Mr. Monte Van茅, a 70-year-old veteran coach of the Southern California Athletic Association, recently, in view of the fact that world pole vaulters often suffer injuries when falling after clearing the bar, as well as the psychological impact on performance, specially proposed the use of wire mesh to replace the currently used sandpits or wood chips. It is said that with the adoption of this new method, not only will injuries be reduced, but world pole vaulting records will certainly be raised several inches or even over a foot. Mr. Van茅, in his decades of coaching experience, has witnessed pole vaulters falling and getting injured many times, such as the famous University of Southern California athlete Mido (the world pole vault record holder). Mr. Van茅 came up with an original idea, imitating the rope nets used by "flying trapeze artists" in circuses, and designed a pole vault landing net. This net has an area of ​​eight feet long and ten feet wide and is installed on a steel frame with wheels. The rope net is stretched over the steel frame, and the net is eight feet off the ground. Therefore, those who fail to clear the bar can still run under the net without accidents. Mr. Van茅 believes that after eliminating the danger of falling from a high altitude, the current world record of fourteen feet eleven and three-fifths inches will undoubtedly be raised to sixteen feet.

### Postponement of the Issuance of Scrip, New Subsidiary Currency from the Ministry of Finance to Arrive Soon, Shipped from Kunming to Shanghai for Distribution by the Bank of China, Market's Subsidiary Currency Panic Expected to Be Resolved

The copper coins and copper currency on the Shanghai market are being hoarded by unscrupulous merchants for profit, resulting in an extreme shortage. Small-value transactions in various industries are severely affected. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting prompt remedial measures.  A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Ministry of Finance, after researching and considering the supply of new copper and nickel subsidiary currency to Shanghai by the Currency Department, has reportedly agreed to hand over the coins minted by inland mints to the Central Bank for shipment to Shanghai for supply. A large batch of new subsidiary currency, including one-cent copper coins, five-cent, ten-cent, and twenty-cent nickel coins, has already been shipped from Kunming to Shanghai. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon and will be distributed and circulated in the Shanghai market by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank.  Efforts will be made to ship more to Shanghai continuously thereafter. Therefore, the shortage and panic of subsidiary currency in Shanghai should be resolved.

Municipal Chamber of Commerce Has Not Yet Received a Telegram Reply

The shortage of copper coins and the difficult trading situation in the Shanghai market have not abated. Complaints about inconvenience are still heard everywhere. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance a few days ago, requesting prompt remedial measures. A reply telegram has not yet been received. All parties are anxiously waiting for the authorities to quickly determine remedial measures to alleviate the difficulties. Currently, stamps and revenue stamps are often used in the market for small change, and some shops have also issued their own scrip to cope with the situation. The medical, tobacco, and generally small businesses are said to be suffering the most.

Two Branches Suspend the Issuance of Scrip

The 37th Branch of the Shanghai City Association on North Fujian Road, after approving the requests of various member businesses to issue joint scrip, with each business jointly responsible for redemption, in order to provide small change and alleviate the urgent need, had resolved to issue 10,000 one-cent and 10,000 two-cent scrips, totaling 300 yuan. All the necessary printing costs were borne by the branch, with the intention of serving the member businesses. Several measures were formulated and reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that if this scrip is issued and is imitated and counterfeited by unscrupulous elements, it would create abuses. Therefore, at 6:00 PM yesterday, all member businesses were invited to explain the matter in detail. It was then decided to rescind the resolution to issue scrip. After various businesses on Xin Zha Road resolved to issue one-cent temporary scrip, representatives of various businesses gathered again at 2:00 PM yesterday. They all agreed that the government would not sit idly by regarding the difficulties caused by the lack of subsidiary currency in Shanghai, and remedial measures would likely arrive in Shanghai within a short period of time. Therefore, it was decided to postpone the issuance of joint scrip.

Transportation Agencies to Issue Paper Vouchers

According to reliable sources, the tram companies in the Public Concession and the French Concession have definitely decided to print one-cent, two-cent, and three-cent paper vouchers. Although it is unknown on what date they will be issued, an employee of the tram company said that due to the urgency of the situation, the paper vouchers will be issued in the near future. Leading figures of the British Concession Public Bus Company are also considering implementing emergency measures to cope with the crisis. However, it has not yet been decided what measures will be taken. It is said that the Public Bus Company has exhausted its previous supply of fractional coins and must immediately find a replacement method.

Safety Campaign: Reception for Reporters, Report on Preparations, Next Week is Promotion Week

The Safety Campaign Committee, initiated and organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, has been preparing for nearly two months. Because various promotional activities have been prepared and are ready, the Safety Campaign Week will be implemented from June 18 to 24. Therefore, the committee's daily work is very busy. At 11:30 AM yesterday, the Safety Committee held a reception for Chinese and foreign newspaper reporters on the second floor of the Da Guangming Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road, displaying dozens of colorful Chinese and Western pictures printed by the committee and reporting on the progress of the preparations. Those present included Mr. Pike, Head of the Traffic Department of the Municipal Council, all Safety Executive Committee members Xiao Debo, Deler, Yin Zhiling, and Tang Guanyi, subcommittee members Zhou Bangjun and Chen Guanqin, as well as more than 100 Chinese and foreign newspaper reporters and guests. First, Chairman Xiao Debo delivered a speech, and then Secretary Bollen reported on the progress of the preparations. At the end, Western refreshments were served to the guests, and a safety campaign film was shown before the event concluded. Another report stated that the Shanghai-wide Safety Campaign Week is scheduled to officially begin on the 18th. At 11:30 AM yesterday, the organizing committee held a Safety Campaign Exhibition at the Da Guangming Cinema and hosted Chinese and foreign press. The venue displayed more than 100 kinds of Chinese and English slogans, all printed with exquisite warnings to pedestrians to be careful while walking and that safety comes first. Secretary Bollen explained the meaning of the safety campaign and the publicity plan in great detail. The Municipal Council will send a large number of promotional materials to the owners of public and private cars throughout Shanghai, including two slogans to be affixed to car windows. At that time, all public and private cars in Shanghai will be affixed with them. On the 18th, all patrolmen will be dispatched to guide pedestrians in walking. The Children's Corps will also do its best to assist. School principals are responsible for guidance, and safety films will be shown in all cinemas. This film has been rushed into production by Xinhua Film Company and will be completed soon. It is expected that the results of this safety campaign will be satisfactory, and traffic accidents on the roads in the future are expected to decrease sharply.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Yuyao, Destroying Over Sixty Houses, Killing and Injuring Over Twenty People, Japanese Machines' Brutality Only Increases People's Enmity

Various counties in eastern Zhejiang, such as Wenzhou, Dinghai, Haimen, Zhenhai, Xiangshan, Shaoxing, and Cixi, have successively suffered from the atrocities and indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes, killing innocent people. Ningbo has suffered the most severe damage. According to news from the aviation industry, at 9:25 AM on the 12th, two Japanese naval aircraft intruded into the airspace over Yuyao and dropped six bombs in the commercial district, destroying more than sixty civilian houses and killing and injuring more than twenty civilians. Yuyao is a small town in Zhejiang Province with no military facilities. However, Japanese planes wantonly bombed it to indulge in their cruelty. This will only arouse more people's enmity and shared hatred.

### Japanese Authorities Issue a Proclamation, Advising Japanese Residents to Be Cautious in Their Words and Deeds, Seeking Solutions to Issues in the Concessions, Japanese Residents Not Yet Moving North of the Suzhou Creek

The "China Press" reports that the Japanese Army, Navy, and diplomatic authorities issued a joint proclamation yesterday (the 10th), urging Japanese residents in Shanghai to exercise patience and be cautious in their words and deeds when seeking solutions to various issues involving the Public Concession and the French Concession here, and to trust the wisdom and power of the authorities. The proclamation mentioned the situation in the Xiamen Public Concession's Gulangyu and the British and French Concessions in Tianjin. Gulangyu and Tianjin Concessions

Recent Disputes

Have not been resolved, and the world is paying close attention to them. Anti-Japanese activities in Shanghai have gradually decreased, but efforts are still needed to achieve a fundamental solution to the issues involving the two concessions. Regarding this, the Japanese authorities are now making preparations to implement their best possible methods. We are well aware that Japanese residents in this city are becoming impatient with the daily problems they encounter in the two concessions. However, they must

Be Cautious in Their Words and Deeds

and express their trust in the wisdom and power of the authorities. Under the current circumstances, we sincerely hope that Japanese residents will act with self-respect, strive for self-improvement, and contribute to achieving the goals of the "Holy War." Also, the Xin Sheng News Agency reported on Tuesday that local Japanese authorities issued a secret order on the 13th, notifying Japanese residents living south of the Suzhou Creek to move quickly to

North of the Suzhou Creek

Anyone who violates this order will be punished by having their passport revoked. A Japanese spokesman replied at a reception for foreign reporters that he had not received such a notice and had no knowledge of it. The claim that Japanese residents are moving back to the north bank of the Suzhou Creek is merely a rumor.

### Abnormal Price Hikes, Affecting Social Tranquility, Price Increases Unrelated to Foreign Exchange Should Be Corrected, The Lives of Commoners and Coolies Become Increasingly Difficult

Shanghai's prices, which normally have considerable connections with various parts of the country, and Shanghai being the national commercial center and distribution hub for import and export goods, its fluctuations are highly valued. After the war, Shanghai's prices have been rising abnormally due to abnormal supply and demand, and the government's control of foreign exchange, causing drastic changes in the black market foreign exchange rates, which have greatly affected the livelihood of citizens. The details are as follows:

Soaring Situation is Quite Alarming

After the war, agricultural products, industrial products, and mineral products have all tended to rise. (1) Agricultural products with an increase of over 100% include tea, gallnuts, and tobacco leaves. Those with an increase of over 50% include tung oil, red sorghum, raw silk, timber, and corn. Those with an increase of over 30% include cotton, peanut oil, sesame, and yellow cattle hides. Those with an increase of less than 26% include Saigon rice, white japonica rice, wheat, soybeans, dried cocoons, pig bristles, edible salt, and raw oil. (2) Industrial products such as flour, cotton yarn, cloth, silk, paper, hardware, cement, pigments, and chemical raw materials have all tended to rise. Imported goods such as pigments, chemical raw materials, hardware, and newsprint have seen the most significant increases. Cotton yarn and cloth have also risen sharply. The reasons are increased ocean freight rates and the tightening of the black market foreign exchange rates, resulting in higher costs. (3) Mineral products that are widely used and relatively important, such as coal, mineral oil, copper, iron, pots, lead, antimony, etc., have seen coal rise by more than 100%. Coal is a daily necessity for industry and households. The price of oil has soared due to the tightening of the black market foreign exchange rates. Other mineral products have also risen successively due to transportation factors, by about 30% to 50%.

Various Manufacturers Have Also Revised New Prices

Due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the soaring of raw materials, various industries in Shanghai have announced increases in selling prices. Yesterday, various manufacturers continued to revise their new prices, including (1) Shanghai Brewery Company, (2) Ewo Brewery Company, (3) Amoy Canning Corporation (梅林罐頭食品公司), (4) Ting Tze Kee Eagle Brand Magnetic Ink, (5) Da Feng Leather Factory, (6) Jian Chen Foreign Firm Leather Department, (7) White Girl Fragrant Powder, (8) Biao Yong An Tang Wan Jin You, (9) Wang He Xing Zipper Factory, (10) Doctor Fountain Pen, (11) Guan Le Ming Fountain Pen Company, (12) Shanghai Wire Factory, (13) Purui Industrial Cooperative, (14) China Chemical Industrial Society, (15) China Tin Foil Factory, (16) Ci Feng Vehicle Parts Factory, (17) Various Factories Affiliated with the Vacuum Bottle Trade Association, (18) Various Businesses Affiliated with the Woolen Goods Trade Association, (19) Hua Sheng Thread Factory, etc. It is found that various industries generally unrelated to foreign exchange are also taking the opportunity to raise prices. If this is not quickly curbed, the lives of commoners and coolies will become unbearable, and its impact on social tranquility will be profound and immense. Powerful groups should jointly seek effective measures to deal with this.

Merchants Manipulating, Threatening Civilians

The black market foreign exchange in Shanghai has shrunk from 8.25 pence to 6.5 pence since the 7th of this month due to the adjustment of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee and the restriction of supply by HSBC and other banks. The cost of imported goods has soared, and selling prices have been raised one after another, including enamelware, leather, vacuum bottles, pigments, coal balls, wire, glass, paint, tin foil, Western medicine, cosmetics, rubber, soap, nails, beer, rental cars, foreign paper, woolen cloth, fabrics, yarn, cigarettes, printing ink, hardware, machinery, coal, and oil wax, etc. However, raw silk, domestic rice, miscellaneous grains, and domestic food products, which are not related to the tightening of foreign exchange, have also increased in price. Among them, there are inevitably speculative merchants attempting to manipulate prices for huge profits. The increase in domestic rice is not far from the price during the winter of 1937 when the war first broke out. Furthermore, Shanghai has sufficient rice reserves and there is no reason for soaring prices. This is clearly the manipulation of speculative merchants. If measures are not taken to stop it, it will inevitably affect the people's livelihood greatly.

Workers' Lives Gradually Becoming Difficult

Abnormal price hikes have led to an increase in the cost of living, which has greatly affected people's livelihood. The following is a record of the workers' cost of living index. For example, if the index in 1926 is taken as the base number of 100%, then in 1938, food is 129.47%, rent is 289.14%, clothing is 126.54%, fuel and lighting is 242.59%, miscellaneous items are 164.20%, and the total index is 160.62. The above index is the highest number since 1926. Since the soaring prices, there has been a huge increase.

Various Sectors Anxiously Hoping for Stabilization

In order to stabilize the prices of daily necessities in various places and crack down on speculation and manipulation, the National Government has promulgated the "Measures for Assessing Prices and Cracking Down on Speculation and Manipulation in Times of Emergency," requiring relevant agencies, chambers of commerce, and trade associations of daily necessities in various places to establish a Fair Price Committee to handle the fair pricing of local daily necessities. All major cities across the country have successively established such committees. However, the situation in Shanghai is special. If a Fair Price Committee is established, there will be many difficulties in implementing crackdowns. Although some people hope that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce will work with various trade associations to assess the prices of daily necessities and crack down on speculators' manipulation, various trade associations believe that there are factual difficulties. Regarding the soaring prices in the concessions, it is hoped that the Public Concession and French Concession authorities will properly plan effective measures to deal with it. Regarding the food-related industries, special attention should be paid to selling prices to avoid affecting the livelihood of citizens.

### Italian Ambassador Travels North for Summer Resort, Departed for Beidaihe the Day Before Yesterday

### Detailed Testimony of the Witness: Ding Gerle's Tragic Death. British Coroner Holds Two Hearings Yesterday and Today. Ding's Abdomen Stabbed Deeply to the Tenth Degree.

Early Surgery Could Have Saved Him.

The Zi Lin News reported that the case of Ding Gerle, a supervisor at the Lun Chang Textile Factory, who was stabbed to death by a Japanese marine on June 6, was continued yesterday (the 14th) afternoon by the British coroner Haines. The first witness, Dr. Kirk, told the coroner that at around 11 PM on June 6, he was summoned by motorboat to the Japanese military hospital in Pudong to see Ding Gerle. Ding's condition was very bad, covered in cold sweat, with cold hands and a barely perceptible pulse. He knew that Ding had serious internal injuries and that the only hope was to perform surgery as soon as possible to treat the internal injuries. So, he was transported to the Customs Wharf and then to the Country Hospital. By the time they arrived, it was around 11:40 PM. The witness, together with Dr. Sun Speck and two surgeons from the Marine Corps, began surgery, opening the abdomen and examining the intestines. They found several stab wounds and sutured them. The injured person lost a lot of blood. The surgery was completed at about 2:15 AM on the 7th. At that time, Mr. Ding's pulse was very weak. He died at 5:30 AM that morning. Mr. Ding had a laceration on his head, a stab wound on his right hip, and a stab wound under his left rib. There were also numerous scars on his hands and forearms. There was only one superficial wound. Medical and surgical books all state that such injuries have a better chance of healing the sooner surgery is performed. According to the witness, most of the injuries were to the small intestine. Injuries to the large intestine are not easily fatal. If surgery had been performed earlier, there would have been a very good chance of recovery.

A Report from the Country Hospital

Next, Dr. Andersen of the Country Hospital, who examined Mr. Ding's body on the 7th, submitted a report to the examiner, revealing that there were wounds on the left arm and shoulder, the right forearm and hand, and the right leg. There were drag marks on the back. The right and left sides of the abdomen, the right hip, the right thigh, and the abdomen were all stabbed. The abdominal wounds were 8 to 10 inches long. Internal examination revealed that the abdominal cavity was stabbed in two places and the intestines were punctured in many places. The areas around the wounds began to inflame. The shock and bleeding from the abdominal stabs were the cause of death. There were a total of five stab wounds caused by the same type or same instrument. The stabbing force was very strong. The marks on the back were caused by Mr. Ding being dragged along the road.

The Circumstances Vividly Described

Bai Langjin, a clerk at the Lun Chang Textile Factory, told the coroner that at 8 AM on June 6, he looked out from the window of the bathroom and saw several Japanese marines rushing to the Lun Chang Company's floating pier, where there was a group of Chinese, some of whom were holding sticks. They were all taken by the Japanese soldiers, entered the textile factory compound through the main gate, and stopped ten yards from the office. Several Chinese people suddenly ran towards the power room. The witness put on his clothes and went downstairs and saw Mr. Ding Gerle holding a Mauser pistol and walking towards the Japanese soldiers and the Chinese people. The witness returned upstairs to his room and looked out the window and saw Mr. Ding and two Japanese soldiers wrestling. Then he pushed one Japanese soldier away with his left hand, turned around, fired a shot into the ground, and walked back to the office. When the witness went downstairs, Mr. Ding was ten to fifteen yards from the office. Japanese reinforcements had arrived. Mr. Ding seemed increasingly angry and occasionally pointed his gun at the Japanese soldiers and officers. Lun Chang employees Sharp Er Scott and Que Tehui Ke and others were standing next to the Japanese soldiers, repeatedly advising Mr. Ding to take a more reasonable attitude. The Japanese soldiers surrounded the office with live ammunition and fixed bayonets. About ten other Japanese soldiers surrounded Mr. Ding and Mr. Xia and others. Then one Japanese soldier jumped on Mr. Ding's back and knocked his pistol to the ground. Mr. Ding tried to grab the pistol, and several Japanese soldiers began to stab and hit Mr. Ding with their bayonets and rifle butts. The witness saw Mr. Ding fall to the ground at one point. The Japanese soldiers seemed to continue stabbing and hitting him. When he stood up, Mr. Xia and Mr. Que tried to push the Japanese soldiers aside. A few seconds later, Mr. Ding was dragged out by a group of Japanese soldiers. At that time, Mr. Ding's blood was gushing out, and his outer clothing was completely red. Mr. Xia shouted to the witness and the other two to come to their aid. Just as they were about to go, they were stopped by the Japanese soldiers. Mr. Ding was dragged on the ground to the back of the factory, about thirty yards. Mr. Xia and Er followed behind. The next time he saw Mr. Ding, he was walking. The coroner asked if Mr. Ding had dropped his gun on the ground. The witness replied, "Indeed. Mr. Ding did not fire a single shot at anyone. At that time, there were two Japanese soldiers near Mr. Ding, and another Japanese soldier was about ten yards away."

Lun Chang Supervisor's Testimony of What He Saw

Xia Pu Er, the spinning department supervisor of Lun Chang Factory, said that at about 6:00 AM on June 6, the witness was having breakfast when a disturbance occurred on the floating pier. He looked out of the window from the south side of the factory and saw a group of coolies walking towards the power room, followed by two Japanese soldiers, leisurely walking in the same direction. The witness and Scott ran upstairs to Ding Gerle's room to ask for a gun. Mr. Ding handed Mr. Shi the key for the gun, while preparing his own Mauser pistol. The witness and Shi took the gun, with the witness leaving the room last, running towards the office. About halfway there, he heard a gunshot. When he arrived at the location of the Japanese soldiers and Chinese people, Que had also arrived. The two attempted to explain to the Japanese junior officer that Ding Gerle was arriving from the factory with blood flowing from his mouth and his gun was lost. At this point, Coroner Haines adjourned the court and adjourned the questioning until 10:00 AM this morning (the 15th).

Japanese Doctors Failed to Provide Careful Treatment

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reports,

British Coroner Haines convened court this morning (the 15th) to continue the hearing on the Ding Gerle case. Mr. Xia Pu said that after Mr. Ding was injured, he accompanied him to the Japanese military hospital in Pudong. According to the Japanese doctor who treated Mr. Ding, Mr. Ding had only suffered superficial injuries. The largest wound did not reach his stomach, and he would recover soon. While Mr. Ding was receiving medical treatment, he said that his stomach was in pain, but the Japanese doctor, although he understood English, did not pay attention to Mr. Ding's words and bound him with bandages. Then, they left Mr. Ding and Mr. Xia inside. Mr. Ding still said that his stomach was in pain. At 12:00 noon, Mr. Ding's condition seemed to worsen. Mr. Xia wanted to ask the Japanese doctor to come again, but he could not because he was having lunch. At 12:45 PM, the Japanese doctor finally arrived, gave Mr. Ding a sleeping pill. At 2:30 PM, he obtained permission from the Japanese side to leave the hospital and reported the matter to the factory. Mr. Xia testified earlier that when Major Nogi arrived at the scene, Ding Gerle, Que Tehui Ke, Shi Scott, and himself were surrounded by Japanese marines. Mr. Ding threatened Nogi with his gun, urging him to order the Japanese soldiers to leave the factory. Nogi retreated, and the witness stepped forward to explain the situation. During the conversation, another disturbance arose. He saw Mr. Ding kneeling on one knee, being beaten with rifle butts by several Japanese soldiers. The witness ran to call for the Japanese soldiers to stop. Major Nogi also approached Mr. Ding and struck him three or four times. The witness pleaded with him to stop. The Japanese soldiers then dragged Mr. Ding twenty-five yards on the ground. The witness asked Nogi where he was dragging Mr. Ding. He replied that he was going to the hospital. At that time, Mr. Ding had gotten up and was walking, with the witness and a Japanese soldier escorting him to the hospital. When court opened this morning, there was only one witness, Mr. Xia. The coroner then adjourned the court and adjourned the hearing until 10:00 AM tomorrow (the 16th).

### The Puppet Organization Again Attempts to Intervene: Fruits, Local Products, and Nutrition. Organization of the "Fresh Fruit and Local Products Market Association." Trade Union Resolves to Unanimously Refuse to Participate.

The Shanghai Fruit and Local Products Trade Union held a meeting yesterday and firmly opposed the so-called "Shanghai Central Fresh Fruit and Local Products Market Association." All members unanimously refused to participate and signed oaths of opposition. Details are as follows:

Attempt to Control

The fruit and local products industry is located in the Shiliupu Laozha Bridge area, with about fifty firms in the entire industry. After the war, some firms stopped operating. However, fruits and local products are essential foods for daily use. Their sources, in addition to transportation and sales from the suburbs of Songhu, are also purchased from foreign countries and various places in Fujian, Guangdong, and Tianjin. Now, they have aroused the covetousness of the "Renovation," attempting to establish a company to control them. The name is "Shanghai Central Fresh Fruit and Local Products Market Association." Luring the scum of the industry, it is presided over by Japanese named Niwa Atsushi and Fujiwara Ueno, with a capital of one million yuan. The main market will be located at the old site of the Sihang Warehouse in Zhabei, and branch markets are planned to be established in Shiliupu, Laozha Bridge, Caojiadu, and Xujiahui.

Resolution to Oppose

The industry's trade union has resolutely decided not to cooperate with the above organization and held a general membership meeting yesterday. More than fifty companies, including Xie Yuan and Xie Feng, were present. Chaired by Xu Runsheng, they discussed countermeasures and resolved that all members would unanimously refuse to participate and signed oaths of opposition to show their determination. It is heard that the so-called "Fresh Fruit and Local Products Market" will use the scum of the industry to win over the industry. Except for a few who agree, the rest unanimously refused. Therefore, it is still difficult to predict whether the "market" will be established at that time.

### The Stabilization Committee Continues to Supply. The Foreign Exchange Fund is Solid. Suppressing the Black Market Exchange Rate and Correcting Trade. The Bank of China Continues to Supply Legal Foreign Exchange.

Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee adjusted the foreign exchange on the black market, the foreign exchange on the Shanghai black market has suddenly plummeted. Those who seek advantages by causing disturbances are spreading rumors to confuse the public, speculators are taking the opportunity to act, and those with superficial knowledge and no fixed opinions are worried and panicked. People are agitated, and the market situation is turbulent. Now, the supply of foreign exchange is gradually increasing, and the situation is improving. The only difference is that the black market exchange rate has tightened. The rumor that the Stabilization Committee's fund has been used up can be dispelled by the current continuing supply.

Moreover, the maintenance of the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai only benefits those who have a direct relationship with the black market. On the other hand, there are those who fulfill their obligations and make sacrifices, that is, the backbone of the Chinese government and the people who need foreign exchange, the importers of foreign goods, those who evade domestic funds, and those who purchase counterfeit money. All of these have many conflicts with national interests. However, in consideration of the complex history and environment of the past, Shanghai still allows it to operate freely on a large scale in secret, and the black market can exist. However, it is not this black market that represents the status of Chinese legal tender. The statutory standard of one shilling and two and a half pence has never been changed by the Central Bank. That is, for legitimate foreign exchange needs, it has always been supplied at the legal price.

There are many strategies to maintain this barrier, but trade adjustment is the main one. The government's policy is to maintain the interests of friendly countries' trade and at the same time strive for trade balance. The fact is very clear. Each of the non-occupied ports has changed from trade deficit to trade surplus. With smooth trade, the exchange market is easy to maintain. In addition, with cautious issuance policies, the normal ratio of materials and currency is not disrupted by changes in quantity. With the original gold reserves and newly obtained loans, the external position of legal tender has been strengthened. However, in the occupied areas, due to the government's lack of authority, the trade deficit has increased sharply and trade has deteriorated. In addition, the purchase of "joint coupons" and "Chinese coupons" has inevitably softened the black market exchange rate. In this environment, if the supply of funds continues at a higher exchange rate, would it not only increase unnecessary sacrifices? Therefore, indirectly suppressing the black market exchange rate to correct the trade situation, or worrying about rising prices due to the reduction of the black market exchange rate, but it must be known that the so-called reduction here refers to the black market. Legitimate necessities from foreign countries are still supplied at the normal price of one shilling and two and a half pence.

Japanese Plane Crashes into the Sea

Sinks to the Bottom

The Japanese plane that crashed near Youshan in Zhenhai has now sunk to the bottom of the sea. The Japanese pilot who died in the fall after deploying his parachute has been buried in the Yifen Cemetery in Zhenhai. His belongings have been transported to Yong. Among his belongings is a photo of the deceased, who appears to be about thirty years old and named Lieutenant Ogihara. The plane is believed to be a Japanese command plane manufactured by the Japanese Fuji Shokuhin Kogyo Co., Ltd. There is also another photo showing a parachute made of white spun silk, demonstrating the parachute's performance state.

### White Russian Groups Separately Announce Liquidation. Only the Russian National General Assembly Registered. But Members Resign in Droves.

The Continental News reported that the "Shanghai Municipal Government," through the White Russian Emigration Committee, issued an order requesting that White Russian professional groups, and even cultural groups, register with the White Russian Emigration Committee. As a result, the National Committee of the White Russian Emigration Federation announced its liquidation yesterday (the 14th). At the same time, it was heard from reliable sources that the Russian Veterans General Assembly on Lafayette Road, the Khabarovsk Military Academy Student Union, and other White Russian groups refused to comply with this order. The Russian National General Assembly here decided to respond to the request and submit a list of its members to the White Russian Emigration Committee and the "Shanghai Municipal Government."

### The Municipal Council Will Adopt Stern Measures Against the "Badlands" of Western Shanghai. If They Do Not Close, They Will Block Traffic into the Settlement. Once Strictly Enforced, the Gambling Dens' Business Will Plummet.

Hollywood Gambling Dens Earn Huge Profits

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported that it is rumored that the Public Concession Municipal Council, backed by the British and American authorities, has unofficially "indicated" to the operators of various gambling dens in the "badlands of Western Shanghai" that they must close their gambling dens. Otherwise, obstacles will be placed, completely blocking their access to the Public Concession. The owners of various gambling dens are very concerned and are seriously considering moving to the interior, reopening in Wuxi, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and Nanjing. However, the profits in the interior are not as high as in Shanghai, so they seem unwilling to move.

It is heard that although Hollywood Amusement Park has paid huge sums in recent months, such as license fees, "protection" fees, and "pacification" fees, its profits have reached as much as four million yuan. The gambling den has a large-scale roulette, so its revenue is very large. The operators of various gambling dens are now discussing the possibility of the Municipal Council taking more stern measures. Although most gambling dens can enter the interior from the "Avenue" area, the Police Department can block their entrances into the Settlement and ultimately search all people coming from the "badlands" area, making it very inconvenient for gamblers, so they do not go to the gambling dens. Those who ride in cars after curfew without a pass can be detained in the police station.

Even those who have passes and frequently frequent gambling dens may have their passes revoked. The "badlands" gambling den owners also believe that the Police Department can take some other measures. If strictly enforced, the prosperous business of the gambling dens will plummet and will not be able to recover. The same is true for opium dens. If the Police Department searches people coming from the "opium area" in the suburbs of Shanghai, it can destroy the opium business, and it will surely find many people carrying opium, red pills, and other drugs. Furthermore, international condemnation of the drug situation in the Japanese-occupied areas has greatly damaged the reputation of Japan and its puppet Nanjing regime. Therefore, the "Renovation Government" is reforming its "anti-drug" policy. The new "anti-drug rules" will be implemented soon, stipulating that opium dens will be divided into three classes according to size. In first-class opium dens, each pipe will be taxed six cents per day, five cents for second-class, and four cents for third-class, which is higher than the old tax. In addition to paying official taxes, opium den operators must also pay "protection fees" to local thugs to ensure the safety of their business and transportation of soil. The "Renovation Government" promises to implement the new regulations and eliminate extortionists in the "badlands," but opium den operators are quite suspicious of the value of this promise, fearing that the "Renovation Government" will demand even greater taxes when "pacifying the badlands."

They also believe that this move is nothing less than "killing the goose that lays the golden eggs." At the same time, soil merchants are also deeply afraid of "white and red enemies," because the sales of heroin and red pills are harmful to the "black goods" business. On the surface, Japanese are not allowed to go to Xinkang Li and Bailinan Road Wujiaochang and other places where opium dens and second-class gambling dens are located, but recently, more and more Japanese have been going to these places to take drugs, gamble, or sightsee.

The police station reported to the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Special Court and forensic doctors to come to the institute to examine the body. As there were no family members in Shanghai, after the investigating detective reported the case investigation process, the official ordered the autopsy to confirm that Li Tianzhu and Xu Yuanzhen died from gunshot wounds. The bodies were handed over to the charity hall for burial. The murderers will be arrested and handed over to the police department for handling. As for the issue of funeral clothing and coffins for the two bodies, if it is determined that they died in the line of duty, the directors of a certain charity hall will decide to allocate funds from the charity fund for clothing, coffins, and burial. The investigation and decision are still in progress.

Young Woman Checks In

The New Hui Zhong Inn, located where Hubei Road, Daxin Street, and Hankou Road meet, is known for its elegant interior and attentive service. As a result, it is a popular choice for the middle and upper classes, and its business is booming.

She paid $7 in national currency and then went out. She didn't return until about 7:00 PM that evening, accompanied by a man.

Playful Banter

The man was dressed in a light gray suit, leather shoes, and a straw hat. He appeared affluent and signed the register as Zhang Zhiwen, 39 years old, speaking with a local accent, and identified himself as a businessman. After having dinner, the night shift tea server noticed the man and woman in the room engaging in playful banter. Around 11:00 PM, Zhang closed the door to go to sleep and instructed the tea server to wake them up at 10:00 AM the next morning. The tea server, suspecting nothing, complied and left.

Discovery of the Tragedy

The next morning, around 10:00 AM, the tea server knocked on the door of Room 412, but there was no response after a long time. Suspicion arose. When they managed to enter the room, they saw the modern young woman lying naked on the bed, blood flowing from her mouth. Upon examination, she was found to be dead. Zhang was lying on the bed, barely breathing. A bottle of empty poison was on the table, indicating that the man and woman had taken poison.

Circumstances of the Suicide

The tea server immediately ran out to report to the front desk, who then wired the Old Zha gate police station. Officer No. 260 rushed to the scene and summoned an ambulance. Zhang was rushed to Renji Hospital, but he succumbed to the excessive poison and died at 3:40 PM that afternoon. The woman's body was sent to the coroner's office. Reporters investigated the incident afterward and learned the circumstances of the man and woman's suicide. The woman was already married, the man already had a wife. Due to intense illicit love, unable to fulfill the wish of growing old together, they resorted to this desperate measure.

At that time, two children were playing by the side of the road. One was Qiang Sangou, 10 years old, residing at 5 Jinjia Lane, and the other was Zhang Jingxing, 7 years old. As the truck passed by, the road was uneven, and the jolting caused a large bale of cotton to fall off the truck, crushing the two children. Sangou sustained chest injuries and was barely breathing, while Jingxing injured his legs. The police arrived at the scene and took them to the hospital for treatment. Sangou eventually died from his injuries.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Increasingly Stable, Cash Market Returns to Normal

The spot gold (烚赤) gray market situation yesterday saw a gradual decrease in the range of fluctuations, mainly due to observations that foreign exchange would not undergo alarming changes in the near future. Considering the uneasy situation in Tianjin and Gulangyu, most operators were cautious. However, the situation was difficult to predict, with the overall trend hovering around 2,590 yuan. This was because certain gold shops and wealthy individuals in the market maintained strong bullish sentiment and bought on dips. However, securities firms and cash shops took advantage of the high prices to take profits, resulting in uncertain fluctuations and, ultimately, no clear winners or losers. Trading also became light, with only about a thousand taels traded throughout the day. There was also no change in gold jewelry prices. It was heard that 200 to 300 taels of gold jewelry were arriving in Shanghai daily from various regions and occupied areas. Customs gold remained unchanged, while British pure gold, etc., rebounded and increased.

Spot Gold Gray Market Neither Flourishes nor Declines

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened with a certain gold shop continuously absorbing supplies on behalf of speculators, and it was heard that the market was relatively stable. At 9:40 AM, the market opened eight yuan higher. A certain gold shop bought 50 taels from a securities firm at a price of 2,593 yuan. Subsequently, due to the strong selling pressure from the securities firm, prices gradually declined. The securities firm sold a total of 100 taels to a certain gold shop at prices of 92 yuan and 91 yuan. Later, a certain cash shop also started selling, and the market became increasingly weak under the double selling pressure, breaking below the 90 yuan level. Soon, it dropped by eight yuan. The cash shop sold 50 taels each to a certain money exchange and a certain gold shop, both at a price of 83 yuan. Then, it sold another 100 taels to a certain money exchange at prices of 82 yuan and 81 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop took advantage of the low prices to buy again, and the price rebounded immediately. The gold shop bought 50 taels from a cash shop at a price of 84 yuan, and another 50 taels from a money exchange at 86 yuan. At 11:45 AM, a money exchange bought 50 taels from another cash shop at 88 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, a certain silver shop suddenly became interested in buying, causing the market to open three yuan higher. The Shou Shan cash shop sold 50 taels to a silver shop at a price of 91 yuan. Then, a certain silver shop absorbed 50 taels from a money exchange at a price of 94 yuan. At this time, a certain gold shop (on behalf of the Hua Nan gang) came to take profits, and the upward trend immediately stopped, turning downward. The money exchange sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop at a price of 91 yuan. A certain Yu shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange at a price of 88 yuan. At this time, the securities firm also came to sell again, and the market became increasingly weak, selling 50 taels to a certain gold shop (on behalf of speculators) at a price of 86 yuan. Later, it dropped by another four yuan. The securities firm sold 50 taels to a gold shop at a price of 82 yuan. After that, the selling interest faded, causing a slight rebound. The money exchange bought 50 taels from a silver shop at 2,585 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening session. As a result, there was neither flourishing nor decline compared to the previous evening's closing price. The fluctuation throughout the day was only 13 yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own-brand gold was 2,595 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,575 yuan. The current markup for gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed price. According to inquiries, there is very little price manipulation.

No Changes in Gold Jewelry

Because the spot gold market showed a fluctuating trend, silver shops made no changes to the selling price of gold jewelry, with Da Tong Hang remaining at 263 yuan and Xin Tong Hang at 261 yuan. The purchase price was 255 yuan.

Pure Gold Rebounds by One Penny

According to a London dispatch on the 14th, British pure gold rebounded by one penny per ounce due to the weakening of the British pound, reaching seven pounds, eight shillings, and five pence. As a result, the People's Bank of China's cash purchase price also rebounded to 1,213 yuan and six jiao. The listed price of Customs gold remained unchanged at two yuan, three jiao, nine fen, and four li. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by seven jiao, reaching 1,206 yuan and nine jiao.

### Chinese Merchants' Resale of Foreign Exchange Is Relatively Active; Japanese Banks Again Drop in Spot

Foreign exchange market conditions yesterday saw HSBC announce its listing prices, with only the Indian exchange shrinking by 125, and all others remaining unchanged. In the gray market, the Japanese bank suddenly re-released the July futures that had been settled in the past few days and dropped them in spot, because they were again collecting large amounts of legal tender in the occupied areas. Foreign firms were actively settling spot transactions, but foreign banks were still willing to maintain prices. In addition, due to the rising interbank lending rates, Chinese banks were particularly willing to sell, further stabilizing the market. Foreign firms with futures were also good at absorbing cheap supplies, resulting in an extremely mediocre underlying trend. As a result, spot prices showed the British pound as unchanged and the U.S. dollar as slightly firm, while futures prices were unchanged. Trading was still active throughout the day. As for the Hong Kong exchange, the foreign banks' supply was still strong, so the situation continued to weaken.

Foreign Firms Compete to Settle Transactions

In the morning, the London bulk rate was initially reduced by .0625 for near-term contracts, while long-term contracts remained unchanged. The New York silver price was stable, London gold rebounded by one penny, and the exchange rate of British pounds to U.S. dollars was down by 1.9, unchanged against Shanghai and France. The U.S. dollar was down by .25 against the British pound, unchanged against Shanghai, and down by .0625 against France. The central government's listed prices for various exchanges remained the same. The banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 6.5 pence for British pounds and 12.625 yuan for U.S. dollars, unchanged from the previous close for British pounds and up by .03125 for U.S. dollars. After the opening, foreign firms and Japanese banks competed to aggressively buy spot British pounds and U.S. dollars, but since Chinese and foreign banks were still willing to sell, the underlying trend was relatively flat. Foreign firms and Japanese banks (brokers) successively bought spot British pounds from foreign banks HSBC, Mckellar and Chinese banks Shanghai at 6.5 pence, and then settled spot U.S. dollars from Chinese-Belgian bank at 12.625 yuan. The balance tax for silver was announced with a continued increase of .5 fen, calculated at 4.50 percent. At that time, overseas Chinese sold July British pounds to counterparties at 6.375 pence. Subsequently, the Japanese bank (through brokers) also sold July British pounds to Yuri at 6.375 pence, and also sold July U.S. dollars to Chinese-Belgian at 12.4375 yuan, presenting a flat-to-firm trend. However, it soon rebounded. Near noon, a foreign firm sold spot Hong Kong dollars to a money exchange at 43.5 yuan, and the situation was also slightly firm. By the afternoon close, the banks' spot selling prices were 6.5 pence for British pounds and 12.65625 yuan for U.S. dollars, the same as the morning opening.

Result: British Pound Unchanged, U.S. Dollar Slightly Weak

In the afternoon, although foreign firms continued to settle transactions, the market showed little change because foreign banks' supply was still good and Chinese banks' willingness to sell was increasing. Foreign firms first settled spot British pounds from foreign banks HSBC, Mckellar, a certain bank, and Chinese banks Zhongnan Shanghai at 6.5 pence, and then spot U.S. dollars at 12.65625 yuan. Subsequently, Chinese banks mutually conducted July British pound transactions at 6.375 pence. Later, the foreign bank Dutch sold spot Hong Kong dollars to foreign firms at 43.5 yuan, with a flat situation. By the evening close, the banks' spot selling prices were 6.5 pence for British pounds and 12.625 yuan for U.S. dollars. The results showed the British pound unchanged and the U.S. dollar up by .03125. Hong Kong exchange rate, after accounting for transactions, continued to weaken by .125.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Weakens in the Afternoon

Hong

Kong, 15th: The exchange market was stable at the opening this morning, with no changes in U.S. dollars, British pounds, or Japanese yen. The Shanghai exchange rate, however, shrunk by two yuan to 227 yuan. At 11:30 AM, there were no changes, but the market atmosphere softened at the morning close. British pounds shrunk by .03125, with the spot rate at one shilling, two pence, and eight one two five, and the forward rate at one shilling, two pence, and seven eight one two five.

In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms were eagerly settling payments, and foreign banks provided ample supply. The Hong Kong telegraph supply was also abundant. As a result, the British pound was flat and the U.S. dollar weakened by .03125. At the opening of the spot gold market, prices rose by eight yuan. Long positions closed out to take profits, and the market softened slightly. In the afternoon, due to the serious situation in Britain and Japan, money exchanges provided supplies, and the market price eventually returned to 2,585 yuan at the evening close, the same as the previous day. The supply and demand of British and U.S. dollars and gold pounds was relatively balanced, but the demand for U.S. gold pounds was higher, and the prices were expensive. The demand for British gold notes was very strong and continued to be firm. The supply of U.S. gold notes was abundant due to the loosening of exchange rates, so the prices were downstream. The demand for French franc notes was rare, and the prices fell slightly. The demand for Singapore notes, rupee notes, and Canadian notes was strong, but the supply was not smooth, so they tended to be firm and expensive. The supply of Japanese gold notes became scarce, and the market price was firm, with the evening market priced in legal tender. Korean notes, on the other hand, were weak due to rare demand, with the evening market at 8 jiao, 4 fen, and 2 li. Transactions in the guild were still active. Jin Da sold and Yong Tai bought 100 units of U.S. gold pounds, Hui Tong sold and Yong Tai bought 40 units of U.S. gold pounds, Qin Tai sold and Fukan bought 50 pounds of British gold notes, and Yong Feng sold and Xin Tai bought 1,000 yuan of U.S. gold notes, Bao Xiang sold and Tong Feng bought 300 yuan of Hong Kong notes. Yesterday's market prices: British gold notes rose by 2 fen, U.S. gold pounds rose by 1 jiao, U.S. dollars fell by 1 fen and 3 li, French franc notes fell by 1 li, Singapore notes rose by 1 fen, rupee notes, Canadian notes, and Philippine notes all rose by 2 fen, German gold notes rose by 1 jiao, Australian gold notes rose by 3 jiao and 1. All other currencies remained unchanged.

Discount Rate at 51 Yuan, Interbank Lending Rate Reaches 2 Jiao

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts suddenly became high, rising from 50 yuan and 2 jiao per thousand yuan in the morning to 51 yuan near noon, and then leveled off in the afternoon, 7 jiao and 5 higher than the previous day. The interbank lending rate also rose to 2 jiao, up by 2 fen from the previous day.

### Securities: Interbank Lending Rate Rises Daily; Bond Market Becomes Increasingly Weak; Decline in Foreign Stocks Is Frightening

The securities gray market situation yesterday showed a gradual weakening and lack of strength. Long positions continued to be cut, rumors about the Tianjin Incident were rampant, and the prospect of reaching the three-yuan line was considered. The interbank lending rate rose to two jiao, and the overdraft interest rate was as high as 1.23%. Financial institutions were mostly unwilling to accept public bonds as collateral. Small money shops were selling spot goods in large quantities, mostly hedging in foreign exchange, which was more profitable. Large investors were buying on small dips, creating a situation that was difficult to reverse. Future fluctuations were numerous. Yesterday's situation: opening prices were relatively flat, but after Lianhe Runli sold a large quantity, and Yuji Shunheng of No. 7 also sold, prices could not be sustained, falling by three or four jiao. On the buying side, Qiafeng Tongsheng bought the most, and Xieda and Tongkang of No. 13 slightly purchased. In the afternoon, investor confidence was damaged by rumors, and the market continued to weaken. Type C bonds broke the four-yuan barrier. Initially, it was very unsustainable, but large investors pulled up the market slightly. Like Lianhe, Shunxiang, Runli, and Songmao, there were continued sales, and market sentiment weakened. Finally, Tongsheng, Qiafeng, and Tiansheng bought, and Yuanhongda also still had an appetite, and prices rose slightly, but market sentiment was ultimately strained. After the close, market sentiment remained weak. As a result, prices continued to fall by a small four and a half jiao to six jiao. The total turnover was approximately one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock

Stock market securities exchange stocks: 100 shares were traded at a price of 19 yuan and 5 jiao.

Shanghai Public Utilities Company reported that the stock market, in view of the uncertainty in Tianjin and Gulangyu, experienced a sell-off of long positions, so industrial stocks were hit and prices fell sharply. The worst-hit stocks are listed below.

At the closing, there seemed to be some absorption, but if the situation remains so tense, buyers in the market will want to stand aside and observe. The rubber stock market was not greatly affected, but trading was thin, buying prices fell, and sellers did not sell at these prices, so most stocks had a large difference between buying and selling prices, making it difficult to see any transactions. It seems believed that the events occurring in China should not permanently affect the value of the rubber industries in Java and Malaya.

The London British Far East Companies' stock prices on the 14th of this month (Wednesday) were generally flat. Only the Kailan Mining Administration's bearer shares fell by six pence, with a price of twenty shillings.

The

London China Foreign Debt market prices on the 14th of this month were hovering, generally stable. Vickers Aircraft Loan bonds fell by one pound, with a price of fifteen pounds. Daokou-Qinghua Railway bonds rose by half a pound, with a price of eighteen and a half pounds. The rest were unchanged.

Shanghai Recovery Public Bond Lottery

The thirteenth lottery for the Shanghai Disaster Area Recovery Public Bond of 1932 (民國二十一年) was held at the Shanghai HSBC Bank at 4:00 PM on the 14th of this month. One winning ticket, number 33, was drawn, with a principal amount of 60,000 yuan in national currency, which, together with the thirteenth-period interest coupon, will be paid by the bank from the 15th of this month, limited to six years. After the expiration date, the bond will be invalid.

### Food: Tianjin Concessions Blockaded; Flour Sales to the North Stalled; Rising Winds Also Hit

Flour

Yesterday, the flour market's rising winds suddenly stopped. Due to the blockade of the Tianjin concessions and the interruption of waterways, the saying that foreign ships were returning goods caused a great blow to the sales of Northern flour merchants. Customers stopped placing orders, and actual sales gradually weakened due to the prices being too high. The turnover decreased sharply. There were about 10,000 bags added by Southern flour merchants and about 10,000 bags sold in small batches in the local streets. Number 2 flour remained at four yuan and eight jiao, with no temporary changes. Foreign flour prices also leveled off. It was heard that several thousand bags of Lantern Brand were purchased by Northern merchants at a price of four yuan, seven jiao, and three fen. In the local streets, 2,000 to 3,000 bags of Bat Brand and other flours were sold at a price of four yuan, eight jiao, and four fen. The market environment was not as sharp as the previous two days.

Wheat

Yesterday, the source of new wheat in the market continued to be small batches arriving at the port. The total amount of wheat arriving by train and boat was less than 1,000 bags. Currently, prices in various producing areas are expensive, making it difficult to match them with selling prices in the Shanghai market. In addition, neither Chinese factories nor Japanese merchants had a formal appetite for buying. Therefore, suppliers planned to store the wheat in warehouses to wait for a good price. As a result, the market was quiet in terms of both supply and demand. It was heard that over 200 bags of new Nanjing wheat were traded in the evening market at a price of six yuan and four jiao. The market was quite good, and it was also bought by local hoarding merchants.

Foreign Wheat

There are 8,857.5 tons, some of which have already been bagged, loaded on the (Riley) managed by Jardine Matheson, which was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 14th, but failed to arrive that day. Yesterday, the company said that the ship had sent a telegram stating that it should arrive tomorrow (the 17th). However, there is no space in the wharves and pontoons along the Huangpu River, so it will have to wait outside the Wusongkou. It is expected to be imported and unloaded around Tuesday of next week (the 20th).

Sources Increase Gradually; Rice Prices Rebound Greatly in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the sources of Du Japonica rice from various merchant groups along the river had not yet arrived. The remaining momentum from the opening of the carload-packaged rice from the Suzhou-Tong merchant groups (包子蘇同帮) was still strong, and the situation continued to be tight. Later, the local streets and hoarding merchants' appetite turned weak, and the market color turned soft, so the market was stabilized. If it is always high, the price is still 19 yuan and 4 jiao. The other Japonica rice and thin rice were all around the original price. In short, this kind of market rose too quickly, which made people suspicious and hoped for a stabilized trend.

Yesterday, the market for passenger indica rice temporarily stabilized. During the morning opening, due to the rising trend of the past few days, suppliers continued to raise prices, and shops, hoarders, and factories continued to inquire, so prices rose by another one or two jiao. However, as sources gradually increased and goods on the way were also being rushed to Shanghai, profit-taking hoarders sought to sell early, and shop hoarders' appetite suddenly became dull. Later, the market fell by a small two jiao, and the medium-grade and old heated rice were cut by nearly one jiao. The northern pointed rice and port pointed rice were also similar.

The stock of foreign rice is all in the hands of merchants and hoarders, and the floating stock in the market is exhausted, so the market is gradually becoming chaotic. When various kinds of rice continued to rise in the morning market, Saigon rice once opened at 21 yuan, one or two jiao, and then opened at 21 yuan, slightly lower at 20 yuan, 8 jiao, and 20 yuan, 6 jiao and a half, bought by shops and consumers. Later, as passenger indica rice rebounded slightly, foreign rice also turned stable.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Broad Beans Become Scarce and Expensive, Soybeans Sluggish and Declining

Since new broad beans entered the market, prices have been quiet and gradually declining due to abundant supply. However, in the past two days, the supply has become scarce, leading to a slight increase in the market. Yesterday, the Swatow guild continued to handle 150 packages of Maojia City Beigang green broad beans at a price of $6.90, which is about 10 cents higher than the previous day. Our company purchased 50 packages of large white-skinned Chongming broad beans for $6.40, and over 500 packages of Jiading white-skinned broad beans for $6.15. It is said that these beans were brought back by the Weihai guild, so the selling price is 5 cents lower.

Since being affected by direct and indirect shocks, soybean prices had risen for a week. Yesterday, various speculative and hoarding activities showed signs of decline, and sentiment also declined with the environment. The entire market only inquired about three carts of Dalian Siping Street beans from our company. Trading opened with three price increases, at $9.35, $9.28, and $9.23, the lowest price of the day, which is $0.17 lower than the highest price of the previous day.

Fifty packages of soybeans were exported to Swatow today, and another 480 packages were exported to Hong Kong.

### Yarn and Cotton: Transactions Involving Speculation, Yarn Market Turbulent and Unstable, Tianjin Concession Issue Ultimately Leads to a Further Drop of $6 for "Double Globe" Yarn

Following the previous day's false boom, buyers were scarce, and asking prices suddenly dropped by $5. 20-count "Double Horse" foreign yarn opened at $485, a significant drop of $7. The highest price for "Double Horse" yarn was $475, with only 10 bales traded. 20-count "Shepherd" yarn fell below the $400 mark, reaching $395. Unexpectedly, the decline was so severe that a major yarn merchant, Mou Ji, had to intervene. Mou Feng Yarn Store, typically busy with daily transactions, can be considered a mainstay of the current yarn market. Yesterday, influenced by the environment, their arrival was late, and they observed without acting, which significantly reduced market activity. Towards the close of trading, multiple parties came to support the market. Mou Chang of the exchange and Mou Company purchased and added to their positions, buying as many as 400-500 bales of 20-count "Double Globe" yarn. This temporarily halted the false boom, and many followed suit. 20-count "Double Horse" foreign yarn was pulled up again to $484 at closing, but only 10 bales were traded, with warehouse receipts still priced at $477.5. In the afternoon, the bullish sentiment revived due to the higher closing price in the morning. Trading opened with price increases. 20-count "Double Horse" warehouse receipts reached $481, and spot goods reached $487. Soon after, short positions in money exchanges sold off, and news of the tense situation in the Tianjin concession spread, causing a sudden drop. However, inter-dealer trading was prevalent, with highly speculative transactions. Given the volume of these transactions, future changes remain volatile. The closing price for 20-count "Double Horse" foreign yarn was $482, and the warehouse receipt price was $476. Statistics show that various guilds purchased a total of 3,100 bales throughout the day, while inter-dealer trading amounted to 2,425 bales. Prices for 20-count "Double Horse" and "Double Globe" yarn fell by $6 each. "Shepherd" yarn and coarse yarn remained unchanged. Shenxin Factory offered 800 bales of 10-count red "Double Horse" yarn at $390 (all marked), for delivery from July to September. Yesterday, 300 bales of cotton yarn arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin. Today, 260 bales were exported to Niutou and 315 bales were exported to Hong Kong. The purchase volume of each guild is listed on the left.

Sales of Japanese yarn are limited. 20-count "Yueqin" yarn opened at $400 in the morning, rose to $402 in the afternoon, but weakened again at closing.

### U.S. Cotton Pest Report, Japanese Factories Purchasing American Cotton, Prices Soar Above $100

Regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market was calm in the morning. Later, due to encouraging reports from overseas cotton markets and severe domestic spot shortages, sales of cloth improved daily, and prices were also very high. Recent weather reports from various cotton-growing regions are concerned about excessive rainfall and active pests. According to various predictions, this year's new cotton crop will be reduced to around 11 million bales, leading to an optimistic outlook for New York cotton prices. Discussions on cotton industry relief funds will resume tomorrow. It is reported that the government has agreed to allocate $22.5 million, but the remaining $11.3 million will be discussed in detail. Yesterday, New York rose 7-8 points, while Indian cotton remained unchanged and Egyptian cotton rose 2-3 points.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was quieter yesterday, mainly due to the decline in yarn prices. However, interest among traders was strong, and if there were any outlets, but due to high asking prices from all sides, the transaction volume was not large, totaling about 1,200 bales.

Japanese-owned Yu Feng Factory is expanding significantly and aggressively purchasing American cotton, acquiring 1,100 bales of packed American cotton (each bale weighing 500 pounds) at a high price of $101.50. This Hua cotton is bright and clean, suitable for blending with Indian cotton for spinning, which increases both efficiency and production. As a result, the price is high. Other traders' Indian cotton business, which had seen large volumes for days, has now slowed down slightly. Regarding cotton from Northern Jiangsu, 204 bales of Xia Sha cotton have arrived. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.

### Piece Goods: Hoarders Releasing Inventory, Postal Parcels to Yunnan Province to Resume, Northern Sales Stalled, Eastern Piece Goods Decline

National Cloth

Yesterday's market showed a loose exterior but a tight interior. After several days of rapid price increases, hoarders were reluctant to sell, and floating inventory was being released slightly. Additionally, due to the blockade of the Tianjin concession, Northern sales were stalled, and the resumption of direct shipping to Ningbo would take time. Therefore, although there was demand, buyers were hesitant to act. Wenzhou merchants, lacking ships for days, have purchased some cheap white goods and are taking a wait-and-see approach, resulting in lower transaction volume. However, interest in colored serge, broadcloth, straight tribute silk, and flannel remains strong, with over 100 additional cases purchased. Merchants from Guangdong and Shantou also purchased nearly 100 cases of the aforementioned autumn goods. Demand for colored serge remains strong, with factories unable to meet orders. Merchants from Mazhang purchased over 100 cases of goods produced by Daxin and other factories. Over 1,000 bolts of colored cloth were purchased by merchants from Taizhou and Xinghua in Northern Jiangsu. Postal parcels to Yunnan province, including piece goods and miscellaneous items for Jianshui, Mengzi, and Shiping, have been approved and will resume on the 16th, with 3,000 packages to be sent. Our company sold 150 pieces of coarse cloth, coarse serge, and fine serge. Hoarders purchased 100 bales of Yihua 16-pound Double Elephant coarse cloth.

Eastern Piece Goods

Yesterday, fine cloth and fine serge declined in price due to the serious situation in Tianjin, which stalled Northern sales. Tianjin merchants continued to sell off their goods, leading to a significant price drop. The lowest price for the leading fine cloth in the morning was $14.25, but prices recovered later. At closing, the current month's leading price was $14.45, and prices for higher-end fine cloth have gradually leveled off. However, the price difference for next month's goods is significant, with the leading fine cloth still requiring $14.65. Actual sales in our company were slow, with only 600-700 pieces traded throughout the day.

Exports

On the 16th, 15 bolts were exported to Hong Kong and 140 bolts were exported to Shantou.

### The Excessively Luxurious "Little Cassimere"

Little Cassimere, originally called (Shark skili) … silk, its face selling price is higher than all the top-tier white … broadcloth, white straight tribute silk. It is truly too extravagant, so market sales cannot be popularized. Previously, the American-made double-width Little Cassimere sample pieces sold for $42.50 per yard, discounted to $17. The larger sample pieces, with a firmer single-width body, cost $12.50 per yard. It is mostly worn by people in dance halls, who do not find it expensive.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Factories Reluctant to Dump Goods

Overseas silk markets are volatile, with minimal price fluctuations. The market situation yesterday seemed to be in a wait-and-see mode. In the local silk market, white factories saw no transactions at $2150 for 78% grade, an increase of $10. However, since the issue of fresh cocoons arriving in Shanghai has not yet been resolved, most manufacturers are generally unwilling to dump their goods. Yesterday, British and French traders made 40 bales, and Indian traders made 30 bales. The market situation was unremarkable.

### Green Tea Steps Up, Transactions Brisk

Yesterday, foreign firms' green tea, especially the top grade, continued to rise by $5 to $10. "Tong Zhen" and "Zhen Mei" grades all rose steadily. Throughout the day, Baochang, Yongxing, Tongfu, Jinlong, Doudell, and other firms traded over 600 boxes of these grades. The top grade even reached $285 to $290, "Tong Zhen" from $215 to $220, and "Zhen Mei" from $670 to over $110. The market was very firm. However, Mao tea from Ningwen and other areas is still difficult to sell well.

### Grain Market: "Mian Chi" Numbered Firms Reluctant to Sell

Yesterday, there were no changes in Hong Kong and Holland prices, but London prices rose slightly. August futures were at 6 shillings 9.5 pence, and December futures were at 6 shillings 15.25 pence, both up by a fraction of a penny. March futures for next year remained at 6 shillings. The local trade association's prices were flat. Spot No. 24 grain, both warehouse and foreign warehouse goods, were priced at the original levels. Customs warehouse was at $20.50 for 500 bags, and road goods were at $25.20 for 200 bags. Taikoo "Che Bai B" wheat (small nine) was at $28.85 for 200 bags, "CW" mark was at $28.60, and "CX" mark was at $28.30 (both small two). Lower grades saw no changes. Domestically produced "You Mian Chi" firms were interested in purchasing, but because the goods arriving were scarce and Dutch red prices were high, they were unwilling to sell much. The future is expected to be tight. Only 90 bags of ordinary "Mian Chi" were offered at $16. "Ti Qing" is also expected to remain tight, with second-grade "Qing" offered at $10.50 for 70 bags, due to their soft texture and faded color. There were continuous offers of "Diao Qing," still at $14.40. Regarding sugar arriving in Shanghai, there were 777 bags from Beihai, 117 bags from Hong Kong, and 654 bags from Shantou.

### North-South Goods: "Xiang Chun Ya" Only Selling for $20

The arrival of "Xiang Chun Ya" (Chinese toon sprouts) is excessive, and fatigue is increasing. The highest price for the top grade was $80, but it has gradually fallen and is now only selling for $20, only one-quarter of the initial price. It can be said to be extremely cheap. Ordinary grade is at $12, and there is little hope of a rebound in the short term.

### Seafood: "Sheng Fen" (Potato Starch) Strong

Dutch "Sheng Fen" was previously being dumped, but due to limited arrivals, it is almost in short supply. Recently, although the exchange rate has declined, prompting purchases from various guilds, market prices are high. Currently, "Ren Qiang" brand is being sold at $21.20, "Fei Qilin" at $20, "San X" and "KG" brands are both at $15.50, "Qing Shuang T" at $18.80, "Shuang T" at $17.80, and "Jia He" at $16.80, all up by $1-2 compared to the previous market. Dutch-produced sago is also available, with large grains selling for $20.05 and small grains selling for $19.50, and the market is relatively stable.

Dragon Whisker Shrimp Tails Continue to Rise

### 

Yantai Longxu Island shrimp tails have become scarce and demand remains strong, so the market is firm. Another batch was sold yesterday at $112, $5 higher than the previous market price.

### Metals: Angle Iron Sales Brisk

Angle iron prices had previously fallen by $0.40-0.50 due to sluggish sales. Yesterday, due to activity from the Qingdao and Yantai guilds, as well as local businesses, the market felt more active. However, because the Japanese recently blockaded the Tianjin concession, the Tianjin market was chaotic, and buyers were not interested in purchasing, resulting in little activity. Other guilds were doing well. Five to six hundred dan were offered throughout the city yesterday, and sales were relatively brisk, with prices increasing by $0.60-0.70. For example, one-inch was selling for $15.50, two-inch for $15.25, two-and-a-half-inch for $15.00, and three-inch for $15.00 (unit: per city dan).

### Medicinal Materials: Mixed Performance

Camphor Recovers After Falling: Camphor is effective in killing insects and preventing epidemics. Domestic products are mostly from Jinhua and Lanxi, but there are also many imports from Hong Kong. The highest price previously was $420 per dan. Recently, sales have slowed down due to the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival, and some smaller businesses are eager to sell, with lower-grade goods selling for only $300. However, firms with higher-grade goods are unwilling to sell cheaply due to frequent declines in the Hong Kong exchange rate. The asking price is now $370-380, and the market has recovered.

Alisma Market Mediocre: Due to scarce supply, the highest price for Double Flower Alisma previously exceeded $60. Later, continuous shipments from Chaoshan and other places led to a price decline, falling to $52. Currently, purchases from various guilds are quiet, and the market remains mediocre. However, due to the tense situation in the Lake Shantou region, there is a risk of supply disruption, so the outlook is positive.

New Honeysuckle About to Arrive: Honeysuckle is currently in high demand, and there is also a transition between old and new crops. Numbered firms are eager to sell off their old stocks, but distributors are not interested. Yesterday's offering was only $40, down by over $10 from the previous price. New goods have already been shipped and are on the way.

Black and White Pepper Have Tightened: The pepper market has been consistently bullish recently due to the exchange rate situation. Currently, No. 1 pepper is offered at $55 in banknotes. White pepper, which had previously fallen to $84, is now being offered at $90, and the trend is firm.

Clothing, Food, Housing, Transportation

### Four-Character Maxims

— Peini

Ancient sages had many proverbs about clothing, food, housing, and transportation that could be used as mottos. Contemporary celebrities also have many four-character maxims about clothing, food, housing, and transportation that are worth considering. Here are a few examples for readers. Dr. Jiang Kanghu, who has lectured in the Americas for many years, is very healthy and has never been ill. He has a four-character maxim: "Cloth, Vegetarian, Exposure, Walk." Choose simple cloth, easy to wash. Eat mostly vegetarian food, avoid meat. Live in exposure, not closed in. Walk often to exercise muscles and bones. The famous calligrapher Ma Gongping works hard but takes good care of his health. He is old but energetic and good at breathing. He has a four-character maxim: "Light, Calm, Breath, Yield." Wear light clothing. Be calm in all things. Breathe deeply. Walk with a gentle pace, not hurried. Minister of Justice Long Wenqian is very energetic, works quickly, and values health. He has a four-character maxim: "Appropriate, Hot, Clean, Straight." Wear clothes that fit, not formal. Eat cooked food, avoid raw or cold. Live in a clean place, not necessarily beautiful. Walk straight, do not hunch over. (Thank you for your response.)

### Leather Shoes and the Women's Shoe Shining Company

— Wang Baiqian

Leather shoes are the most popular and common type of footwear. Not only do people in the upper classes wear them, but even middle-class people and laborers want to buy them. At the very least, they will buy a cheap pair from a used goods stall by the roadside. As a result, the leather shoe industry has developed immensely.

With the times, leather shoes have evolved from flat heels to high heels, from round toes to pointed toes. Recently, a new type of cream-colored leather sole has been introduced… with many different styles to meet the needs of the public. However, cream-colored soles… are the footwear of wealthy young masters and ladies, who are meticulous in every aspect. As a result of this meticulous pursuit, they came up with the idea of having women shine their shoes, so that their leather shoes are always kept shiny. This is certainly the happiness of wealthy young masters and ladies.

Women's shoe shining companies are usually located near dance halls. For example, the "Elegant Foot Women's Shoe Shining Company" near a dance hall has a very simple interior. Besides five or six women,

Due to the need for refinement, the styles of leather shoes change with the times, but there is nothing else of note. Their attire is strange, resembling a half-female student and half-factory worker. When a customer arrives, they are greeted warmly and seated. The women then begin to work—shining shoes. They are indeed experienced shoe shiners. The price is $0.14 for patent leather, $0.17 for champagne leather, $0.07 for ordinary leather, and $0.04 for white powder polish. The busiest time of day is when the lights are turned on, as many men and women are eager to show off and flock to the place. The business is exceptionally good and closes around 11:00 p.m., catering to the tastes of partygoers.

### New Ventures on Isolated Islands

— Wu Yunzuo

### The Utilization of Broad Beans

— Tianxu Wosheng

Broad beans contain more protein than rice by a factor of four, and more than barley by a factor of more than one. The amount of starch they contain is equal to that of rice and barley. The amount of starch they contain is less than that of rice and barley by a factor of one-third. Therefore, they can stave off hunger without producing phlegm. If sprouted, ground with water to form a paste, dried in the sun on bricks, roasted until fragrant, and then ground into powder, mixed with refined flour or sugar, and pressed into square cakes, they can be used as snacks. If used for military purposes, they can relieve hunger and quench thirst, but they must be chewed thoroughly to produce saliva and then swallowed in small portions. One square inch can be equivalent to one he of rice, capable of sustaining hunger for four hours (the same is true for iron beans). To stop children from crying from hunger during times of hardship, adults should chew them into a paste and feed them a fingertip's worth. Because they contain saliva, they are easily digested, will not cause bloating, and can sustain hunger for twice as long as wheat flour. Some say that broad beans cause bloating, but this refers to those who eat too much when boiled. Once roasted, they can relieve bloating, but should not be eaten in excess. They should only be eaten when hungry and stopped before feeling full. This applies to all things.

The entire broad bean shell, stem, and leaves contain a large amount of fixed nitrogen and can be soaked to make fertilizer. They are extremely easy to grow and contain nitrogenous fertilizer. Dried and burned, they can repel mosquitoes and flies. The ash can be placed in a bamboo basket with springs, covered with a jar, with a hole drilled in the side of the jar. Arrange four jars in a row, and connect a bucket underneath. Pour boiling water into the first bucket, which will then leak down through the second, third, and fourth buckets. The liquid can be scooped up, dried, and made into blocks. The black blocks can then be mixed with wood ash and placed in the stove, causing it to turn gray-white. When redissolved in water, the organic matter is converted to charcoal, which can be precipitated and filtered. The filtered liquid is boiled with alkali, which is sold as gelatin and has a wide range of uses. It can be used to wash oily clothes.

### Review of Gujiazhai Park

— Zhuodai

To discuss Gujiazhai Park, one must first understand the history of French gardens. The early French garden was created by a Frenchman named Nordel, who learned from the Italians. Italian gardens were built on sloping hillsides, so terraces and levels were the main elements. The French landscape is different, consisting mostly of plains. Nordel adapted the Italian hillside garden design to a flat style, and this is the French style. The famous gardens of Versailles are representative examples created by Nordel.

Italian gardens are on hillsides, so the focus is on overlooking the landscape. The French style transforms the Italian style into a flat landscape, so the focus is also on overlooking the landscape, utilizing the boundless scenery of the plains to create a grand and magnificent feeling. But this French style is best suited for large areas. Small-scale gardens may seem too simple. This led to the emergence of a new French garden.

The Italian style and the French style are both formal styles. The new French style incorporates some natural elements. As a result, the French garden becomes a hybrid, with Nordel's elegant and gorgeous designs as the foreground and natural landscapes as the background. What is now known as the French style is the latter.

Gujiazhai Park clearly belongs to the latter. There are many flat, open areas for viewing, such as flower beds, lawns, and ponds. In addition, the towering trees lining the paths and the forested area along the western side are all naturalistic backgrounds. In these respects, it is a pure new French style.

However, some parts still have an Eastern flavor, which is probably due to environmental factors. Building artificial mountains is a Chinese specialty, but they have little value in terms of garden art. From an enjoyment perspective, they do not create a sense of exploration for visitors. Gujia Mao Park also has these features, which are obviously adapted to the environment. The stones are well-chosen (because they do not use Taihu stones), but the arrangement is not very clever.

In the center of the pond, there is a fountain. Below the fountain is a glass umbrella with lighting. When the lights are turned on at night, one realizes that the glass is multicolored, red and green, which is very eye-catching. This aspect may also be catering to the Chinese, but it is too vulgar.

The surface of the pond is covered with a lot of man-made trash, which is the result of some uncultured visitors.

This type of garden is best enjoyed on fine days in the spring and autumn. In the summer, it is best to visit early in the morning or in the evening, as it cannot be enjoyed under the scorching sun. In the winter, it can only be visited on warm and sunny days. Considering the size and population of the French Concession, Gujiazhai Park is actually not enough. However, looking at it another way, not everyone who visits has the purpose of resting, entertaining, or appreciating the scenery. There are also many men and women with other intentions.

### One-Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

The weather is getting hotter every day. Summer has truly arrived. Even if fatty fish, meat, and richly flavored dishes are spread all over the table, they may make people feel slightly apprehensive. Therefore, every meal must include something refreshing. Speaking of refreshing dishes, one must abandon stir-frying and focus on dishes that are tossed. For example, chicken shreds tossed with lettuce. Readers may be startled by the word "chicken," thinking that chicken prices are so high that it could not be in an economic menu. In fact, there is no need to be alarmed. You can go to a larger local market and buy a chicken leg for two jiao and some lettuce for one jiao. When you get home, cut them into shreds, blanch the chicken, soak the lettuce, and then mix with soy sauce and sesame oil. The taste is very good. Another example is mixing shredded egg skin, shredded pork, and bean sprouts. Those who like sour flavors can add some Zhenjiang vinegar. This is commonly known as "tossed with vinegar" and is also very palatable. As for vegetarian dishes, there is cucumber slices tossed with sweet and sour sauce, cucumber shreds, mung bean noodles, and sesame paste, as well as tofu tossed with Chinese toon and sesame oil. These are all very refreshing and can be eaten with rice or porridge.

### A Brief History of the Bicycle (Part 2)

— Xi

Later, after research by Baron Karl Drais von Sauerbronn of Germany, a single-track vehicle was created and first appeared in Mannheim, Germany, in 1817. The following year, he brought this vehicle to London, where the public was impressed by his ingenuity and gave it many names, the most common being Dandyhorse. A major difference between this vehicle and those made previously was that it had a front wheel mounted on a steering axis, allowing it to be freely controlled. The Baron had hoped to make a big splash in London, but he was soon ridiculed and satirized by many cartoonists and writers, so the Dandyhorse had to beat a retreat, bidding farewell to London forever. However, it did at least inspire one gentleman, Kirkpatrick Macmillan, who lived in Scotland. He attached a crank to the Dandyhorse, and by using long rods, tirelessly strived to achieve movement, resulting in the birth of the pedal bicycle.

Macmillan's vehicle, created in 1839, greatly amazed the local people. Macmillan often invited many guests to personally demonstrate the vehicle in a field, but the world remained indifferent. It was not until fifty years later that Dalzell of Lanark Outer Borough created the first truly functional pedal bicycle, which appeared on the market, and this transforming vehicle, "BICYCLE," gradually attracted the world's attention, bringing him great fame. Lanark's new vehicle was based on Macmillan's 1846 model. In 1889, Macmillan's vehicle was still displayed at the London Vehicle Exhibition, labeled as the original old-style bicycle. Over the decades, Macmillan's vehicle underwent several significant changes. In 1868, someone attached pedals to the front wheel to replace Macmillan's lever pedals. In 1879, someone placed the two wheels side by side, with the rider sitting in the middle. In 1878, lever pedals and a rear wheel were restored, but the rear wheel was twice the size of the front wheel. Later, Lawson's safety bicycle appeared, truly innovating, but the handlebars were placed too high, causing inconvenience for the rider. It was not until Lawson's successor moved the seat above the front wheel, with the front wheel's diameter being four feet six inches, that the rider could suddenly and freely move up and down and advance in any direction.

In 1888, Dunlop invented the rubber tire, earning him fame and fortune. Previously, bicycles were only used for occasional amusement, but their numbers gradually increased. Then, the hard rubber on the wheels was replaced with pneumatic tires, and bicycles became popular worldwide. Since then, the main principles of the bicycle have remained largely unchanged. Wire wheels were first used in 1870, and ball bearings were first used in 1877. As for the small mechanical components on the bicycle, they also required much thought and underwent several improvements to achieve today's lightness and agility.

### An Opinion from a Translator

— Bai Ying

Casually browsing the catalogs of recently published books, I cannot help but notice a noteworthy phenomenon in the publishing industry: translated works tend to surpass original works in general. In terms of quantity, original works undoubtedly still dominate, but in terms of quality and appeal to readers, translated works certainly hold a proportionally overwhelming advantage.

Taking Shanghai as an example, one of the greatest achievements in publishing recently has been the publication of "The Complete Works of Lu Xun." At the same time, there has also been the appearance of "The Complete Works of Lenin" and the fully translated "Das Kapital." However, in terms of new original works, we have not yet seen a truly powerful work (regardless of its nature). But in terms of translated works, there have appeared a considerable number of works sufficient to attract a large segment of readers. In addition to the aforementioned "Complete Works of Lenin" and "Das Kapital," the more famous translated works published in the past year include "Red Star Over China," "Continued Red Star Over China," "Japan Challenges the World," "Japan's Gamble in China," "The New Chinese," "Japanese Spies," "Record of Japanese Army Atrocities in China," "Red Front," "The New Soviet Constitution," "China Fights for Freedom," "Impressions of New China," as well as Pearl Buck's recently published "The Patriot," and "Inside Asia," which is currently being rushed into translation following "Inside Europe," etc. Moreover, there are as many as one hundred seventy-eight more works either announced or that I personally know are being translated.

This "prosperous" phenomenon in the translation field, on the bright side, introducing foreign viewpoints and ideas as a reference for our own country's cultural work is originally a very gratifying phenomenon. We certainly cannot complain that there are too many translated works. In fact, compared to Japan, our introductory work is still far behind, although the quality of introductory work in Japan at present is far inferior to ours.

But here, we should reflect: Why do foreign authors specifically write so many works about recent Chinese issues (or Sino-Japanese issues and Far Eastern issues), while our own country's authors do not have such achievements to show? A foreign journalist comes to China, observes for a year or two, and then publishes a book about Chinese issues upon returning home. Logically, Chinese journalists, who have more access than foreign journalists, should have even better achievements, but in reality, while it cannot be said that there are absolutely none, the works of value that are published are a minority within a minority.

For example, in a novel like "The Patriot," there is no reason why a Chinese literary author could not write it. I personally even deeply believe that if a Chinese writer with existing literary cultivation and skills were to handle the same subject matter, they would definitely write something even better than Pearl Buck.

However, up to now, we have not discovered powerful new original works. I personally am someone engaged in translation work. My raising the above question is certainly not intended to blame the dereliction of duty of creative writers. Because I know that the current environment has all sorts of difficulties. But I cannot help but admit the pain that I often feel in my heart. Every time I resolve to begin translating a good book about Chinese events, I cannot help but have such a feeling in my heart: Why are these good materials and good subjects not handled and organized by our own writers, but instead, we wait for others to write them before translating them back? Clearly, it is our own thing, but we have to use someone else's name. This phenomenon is too heartbreaking.

Translation work has its own independent meaning, but a translator with national consciousness does not hope to specialize in translating things that could have been written by his own country's authors; his main responsibility does not lie here. But those currently engaged in translation work, because the objective situation is like this, have no choice but to temporarily set aside the responsibility of introducing Western culture and return the Chinese problem materials collected by foreign authors back to their original owners.

My view may be too shallow and narrow, but it comes from the most sincere and purest motives.

### Reading the Ji Rang Ji Collection

— Chen Youqin

Because I wanted to study the life of Tang Shunzhi, a Ming Dynasty scholar who resisted pirates, I made a special effort to carefully read the Tang Jingchuan Ji collection. Jingchuan highly praised Shao Yong's Yi Chuan Ji Rang Ji collection, which aroused my interest in reading the Ji Rang Ji collection.

The Hanfenlou Secret Collection edition of the Yi Chuan Ji Rang Ji, has a total of four volumes, printed very meticulously, and the paper is especially clean and delightful. The books of this kind in the school library are probably borrowed by me, a person who is out of touch with the times, to occasionally read, except for feeding bookworms.

Frankly speaking, Shao Yong's poems are too didactic and mostly rational. Some places are simply no different from gathas and dogmas. Although there is a poetic flavor, it is not as strong as the philosophical meaning. It can be said to be a completely philosophical poetry collection.

Speaking of philosophy, let Mr. Ma Yifu and others preach in the Fuxing Academy. I can only extract a few words from the Ji Rang Ji to admonish myself.

Adornment Poem

Adornment at the time is called skillful, the accomplishment seems like a real home. Must beware of cold eyes entering to observe, ashamed puppets have no curtains to cover.

Clay and Wood Puppet

Clay and wood puppets, be careful not to laugh at each other! When the sky is about to rain heavily, you can only condole each other.

There are too many puppets without curtains to cover them at present. "Called skillful" and "seem like a real home," are they ultimately "skillful" and "real home"? It is just "allegedly" and "resemble" (as if something important is happening).

As for the clay and wood puppets, they seem to be laughing triumphantly for a while, but when a heavy rain falls, they can only "condole each other."

There is a Big Fish in the East Sea

There is a big fish in the East Sea, nets cannot approach, if it loses water, ants can trap it.

What this big fish refers to, I think discerning people will know at a glance. It seems that no nets can approach it at present, but when its power is exhausted, it will immediately become a "crucian carp in a dry rut," and its death is approaching.

Also, Kangjie said in the "Luxury Poem": "Extravagance cannot be extreme, luxury cannot be endless; extreme leads to disaster, endless leads to misfortune." It seems that we Chinese people, who are still prone to extravagant habits today, should take this as a warning.

In his "Up and Down Poem," he says: "...Observe things with your own heart, what thing can be one? Observe the heart with things, what heart is not equal?" I think it is the same as the saying that "idealists say that the mind dominates matter, and materialists say that matter dominates the mind." I wonder if someone will laugh at me for being far-fetched?

He extremely opposes bookworms, which shows that he is not advocating reading books to death. There is a poem called "Exposing Books" as proof.

Insects harm books less, people harm books more. Insects are removed by exposure, what should be done with people?

His views on poetry are as follows:

Why is it called poetry? Poetry is expressing one's ambition. Once words are used to form chapters, the matters in the heart are then stated. Not only refine the words, but also refine the meaning. Refining the words yields strange sentences, refining the meaning yields marrow.

——On Poetry Poem

The Ji Rang Ji has four volumes and twenty chapters, and there is too much to talk about. What I have quoted is only a few dozen words above. It is truly the so-called "Let it be three thousand weak waters, I only take a scoop to drink."

There are many beggars by the roadside, filthy, disabled, and the stench is overwhelming. The two Pengs were frightened when they saw them, because they had seen many of these ailments in their hometown. The larger ones were like leprosy, but in Hunan, it was limited to beggars sitting in "paralyzed sedan chairs." I couldn't help but say again in a pedantic way:

"Speaking of history again, leprosy is also a national essence. I once saw a medical newspaper saying that Confucius' disciple Bo Niu died of 'leprosy.' This so-called 'leprosy' is leprosy. If even Bo Niu, with his good morals, got leprosy, wouldn't the bad ones have to open a skylight?"

People in Guangdong see many lepers, but they hate talking about it. It is a very terrible thing, but in Hunan, it is limited to beggars sitting in "paralyzed sedan chairs," which is a bit strange. Could it be that people in Hunan are all scoundrels?

A few more miles up, the mountain road became steeper. There were still some people in relatively good condition, who looked like refugee farmers, guarding a small triangular thatched shed in a place with shade and spring water, as if the whole family lived inside. They used "begging books" to ask people in long robes to write a few words, begging for small donations of ten or twenty copper coins. According to passers-by, some of them, after collecting these donations, bought one or two piglets, and together they lived and ate in the thatched shed. When the meat embryos grew up, they rushed to Nanyue City, where they could become small stall owner.

Among the dwarf trees on the mountainside, some small monks were picking something. Judging from the bamboo shoot husks left by the roadside, they were looking for a large number of small bamboo shoots, preparing to transport them back to the temple, grind them into powder with iron mortars, and make vegetarian cakes for the long-term vegetarian diet. There were also some local merchants picking medicinal herbs, sweating and working silently among the mountain rocks. They obtained large quantities of raw land, honeysuckle, angelica and other more valuable medicinal herbs, seemingly enduring any hardship. However, the quality of Nanyue's medicine is very poor; because the mountain land is barren and the climate is harsh, the properties of the medicine change when it grows. However, they use this to supply the market within a hundred or two hundred miles, which is more than enough.

These situations were roughly learned from a brief conversation with an old monk who was traveling along the same road.

We looked at the map for a while and found a stone staircase. After a mile's distance, we came to a very secluded and elegant place – Banyun Temple. At the foot of the temple, clouds and smoke stretched like cotton, lightly covering the Yan family, green trees, rice fields, manure ponds, people and dogs below the mountain.

"This is a place worth lingering in," said Da Peng. "I have never believed in those traditional painters. Now I can prove from here that the matter of 'clouds stopping halfway up the mountain' is not false. It turns out that the foundation of traditional painters' art is also something that people should explore!"

The temple was very ancient. On the stone steps, moss and felt were as thick as wool. Trees that were more than three hundred years old, and the vines attached to them, had been growing for a century. Like dragons and snakes, they protruded into the semi-space. The houses, which had been repaired countless times, were plastered with some powder on the stone blocks. The abbot was jointly appointed by a monk and a Taoist priest; the monk was fat and the Taoist priest was thin, vividly showing the outer appearances of two types.

Their lives were business-like. When they saw passengers in sedan chairs, they had to bring out the begging books; but for pedestrians, a cup of tea and a meal had to be asked for. Their two main rooms were rented to the families of two military officers. One was the wife of a brigade commander, and the other was the wife of a regimental commander. They lived very simply, as if they hadn't even hired a maid.

Er Peng had a great power of observation; he lingered at the doorway for a while, and then came out and said to me and Da Peng:

"The regimental commander's wife is okay. That brigade commander's wife—ugh..."

"Maybe," Da Peng responded, "the monk just hinted something to me, maybe even the monk..." After a while, he took a drag of half a cigarette, and then said:

"Lao Li, you might as well use the realist approach to paint the modern materials covered by ancient civilization. I am willing to be a small critic, at least proving that there is not a single lie in your work."

They all laughed. The Taoist priest walked from afar, leading us to see a building twenty or thirty steps away—the China Travel Service.

From the Taoist priest's statement, we learned that this place was where Zhang Xueliang was "secretly released" in Nanyue some time ago. Now it is being prepared to be left for important people to live in. We saw some civil servants sitting and chatting at the door, and a wounded pilot, half of his head wrapped up, leaning on a walking stick.

The Taoist said, "Rest for a while, gentlemen! We are all family, all born in China, and follow Chinese teachings..."

A boy brought tea and placed it on the stone steps. Everyone yielded for a while. We began to converse for a while.

Spring and Autumn

### The Lonely Wave of the Hai River

— Xiang Hou

This is a letter written by Englishman A in Tianjin to Englishman B in Shanghai. B is a friend of mine, and with his permission, I am able to translate and publish a section of the letter concerning Tianjin. However, he is unwilling to reveal his real name, so they will only be referred to as A and B here.

In Shanghai, the air is still relatively fresh, although we already feel suffocated; but in Tianjin, this ancient city, only the muddy waves of the Hai River can still surge freely. As a foreigner, it is not easy for me to obtain the usual preferential treatment that I receive in other parts of China here. Indeed, we also have our concession here, but the situation is ten times worse than in Shanghai. The concession, like the Hai River, is overflowing with muddy currents.

Arriving here is even worse than a prisoner arriving at the courtroom. The interrogation is extremely strict, and after seeing the "little devils," one must also see the "deities"—the so-called "little devils" and "deities" are popular slang in Tianjin, with "deities" referring to the Japanese, and the meaning of "little devils" being self-evident. In the first few days, it seemed that my movements were being monitored at all times. Later, I made a special trip to visit a Chinese friend I had met in Harbin, who has a not-so-unfamiliar name: "Tao Yanxin" (transliteration). He had once been detained by the young general Zhang Xueliang, but is now an educational administrator here. After not seeing each other for several years, this middle-aged politician has grown a Nazi-style mustache. I know that his past years have been spent on "good neighbor" work, and now he seems to be partially successful; however, his position is constantly shaking as if in a dream. In the north, the "little devils"—and I'm afraid it's not just in the north—must, on the one hand, endure the suspicion of the suspicious "deities," and on the other hand, consider the attention of the children growing up in this land.

The greatest danger for the Chinese in Tianjin is the issue of thought. "Thought criminals" are almost impossible to accommodate in prisons. Because the meaning of so-called thought criminals is extremely broad. There was a Chinese painter who was arrested by the police for drawing a plum blossom under a circle. According to the painter, the circle symbolizes the moon, and Chinese people generally draw plum blossoms together with the moon, but the Japanese said that the circle symbolizes the sun, and the plum blossom is the national flower designated by the Chiang Kai-shek government!

Here, the Japanese use the number of their compatriots arrested by Chinese people acting as police officers as the standard for promotion. Therefore, the police in Tianjin are only concerned with arresting people all day long. Often, when two police officers meet, they ask each other: "How much gold sand did you pan today?" "Gold sand" has become a euphemism for prisoners! However, the Tianjin police often become others' "gold sand" themselves when performing their duties at night!

There are many burning incidents here, and the places where fires break out are generally owned by a certain party. As for the cause of the fires, even those involved are tight-lipped!

The economic plunder here can be said to be meticulous. I have attached a "half-cent reserve coupon" (see the copper engraving), from which you can see their means of exploitation.

### Impressions of "The Beginning of Man"

— Bai Hua

"There is no such thing as a bad child!" After watching "The Beginning of Man," I remembered the words of Father Flanagan in "Boys Town." And the power of education, finally, even a stubborn, wild child like Michel Rougon can be reformed. "The Beginning of Man" is about a girls' reformatory outside Paris. This place also imprisons a group of young criminal girls. But the director, Émile, treats these girls like prisoners, and the tool of reform is "corporal punishment."

"There is no such thing as a bad child!"—This group of helpless girls were only sent to the reformatory for minor faults. In their pure souls, they equally adore the air of freedom, but under the wrong methods of reform, the inevitable result will be to provoke the opposite. Lanie sees Suzanne and Georges kissing, and uses this to blackmail Suzanne into stealing cigarettes and alcohol, causing a catastrophe. This is the inevitable cause and effect of the greater the pressure, the greater the resistance. There is an even more obvious example here: no matter how strict the discipline, as long as they have an opportunity, they will pick up bricks on the ground to destroy the rules of the reformatory. This made the newly appointed director Yvonne see clearly that "corporal punishment is not enough to tame their nature."

Let's look at the results under reasonable reform methods.

Yvonne releases this stubborn, wild Suzanne to go shopping in the city, giving her a happy afternoon. Director Émile naturally opposes this method, but Suzanne finally returns before nine o'clock.

"There is no such thing as a bad child!" We can now believe Flanagan's words.

At the same time, "The Beginning of Man," under the superb skill of director Herschel Daugherty, every scene and every play is handled very movingly.

At the beginning of the film, the camera moves from the vast sky to the narrow walls of the reformatory, and with Émile's violent cry of "Two, one, two," a group of girls are shown doing morning exercises under strict supervision. Suzanne is ordered to go to the city to shop. She walks out of the iron gate of the reformatory. She stands in the sunlight outside the door. She seems to feel that her own existence is a little hazy. When she lies on the grass, watching the flocks of birds in the sky, the movement of the majestic clouds, and the swaying of the wheat waves in the wind, this simple picture shows how those children crave the world of freedom.

Although the story later progresses to Suzanne and Georges' love, there is one scene that cannot be ignored: Lanie blackmails Suzanne into stealing alcohol and causing trouble, but when she learns that Suzanne has been approved by her superiors to be released from the hospital early, she resolutely "reveals the whole truth"; when Suzanne is discharged from the hospital, her companions all send her off to each other, which shows that Lanie and others have been reformed by Yvonne, and they are no longer bad children.

Therefore, I do not agree with the view that the romance in "The Beginning of Man" weakens the power of the theme, and that the power of reform is only Suzanne.

Yvonne's "sacrifice of personal happiness" is as great as Flanagan's spirit of sacrifice!

The acting skills of newcomer Corinne Luchaire are indeed a sign of Alexander Korda's wise eye for talent. From beginning to end, from a stubborn, wild child to being reformed, and privately falling in love with Georges and pleading guilty to Yvonne, she changes her different personalities in the appropriate process, without exceeding or falling short. Mathilde Théré's Émile and Annie Ducaux's Yvonne were also successful. Only Georges Barettes, who played Georges, was a little weak.

### "Maginot Line" and "Glamorous Star"

— (Li Zhihua)

This time, the Cathay Theater's program combines the newsreel "Maginot Line" with the feature film "Glamorous Star." This can be interpreted in two ways. One is that "the progress of the times" has reached a stage where great changes are happening, and it is impossible to turn a deaf ear to it. Therefore, the French Maginot Line, known as one of the strongest national defense lines, has been promoted. The other is that the protagonist of "Glamorous Star," John Barrymore, is an aging artist. Old things are worthless. Although he was once famous, now he has to rely on newsreels like the Maginot Line to help as a selling point. This really makes people sigh, "Ah, aging artist!"

The Maginot Line newsreel has two reels. Of course, because it "concerns military secrets," it will not show us the whole picture. However, comparing "Maginot Line" and "Glamorous Star," I would choose "Maginot Line." The reason is very simple. Although this newsreel is not "artistic" enough, it has a close connection to the world we live in. People need to survive to enjoy things. This is why I would rather like it; it's not just because it enriches my knowledge a little.

Admittedly, the Maginot Line is not our Chinese "Maginot Line" newsreel, and it only has a little demonstrative nature. But since every country cannot be isolated and closed off, and China is now playing an important role, we cannot help but feel that we should pay close attention to the French national defense, which is one of the allies of the peace front. Of course, it's not our own, but at least it's our friend's.

As for "Glamorous Star," perhaps I didn't have much hope when I went to see it, so I wasn't too disappointed. The harmonious joy within the family makes people feel the warmth and loveliness of the world. The sudden rise of a muddlehead is indeed a thorn in one's side, but it also gives one a sense of jumping out of nowhere.

John Barrymore's acting still has that theatrical feel. These movements would be very good on stage, but through the exquisite "eye-myra-eye" technique, it becomes fiery. Peter Holden and Virginia Weidler are a promising child duo, especially the seven-year-old Peter. With good training, he will not lose to Mickey Rooney and others.

The director is not bad, especially in writing the children's scenes with Peter and Virginia, which have a unique touch.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 12: The Red Powder Eliminates Enmity but Cannot Erase Sin; Talking of Love in the Green Window, Renewing Good Fortune

But they thought that a dancer is, after all, just a dancer. Old Man Pan is now a rich man, with high status and lots of money. In the eyes of the dancers, marrying him would mean enjoying endless wealth. However, Ling Xiaohua thought, "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger?" Otherwise, there are many handsome young men who love her, so why reject them and instead follow an old man, Pan? It is because she wants to avenge. For the sake of revenge, as long as the goal is achieved, anything is possible. The so-called only seeking the goal, not questioning the means, is often the case with revolutionaries. Moreover, Ling Xiaohua's goal is not only on Old Man Pan; her goal is beyond Old Man Pan, because Old Man Pan is very close to a group of people she hates. She can find opportunities with Old Man Pan to achieve her revenge goal. Her meaning is clear to everyone in the group who are her comrades. Her sacrifice of her beauty and her contribution of her chastity allow the people in the group to pity her, respect her, and are willing to help her. Although she felt stimulated after seeing Fei Gongren assassinate the tiger, she did not regard Old Man Pan as the tiger in her mind; she had a different tiger in her mind. It just so happened that the opportunity came that day. She knew that Old Man Pan had invited someone to his house, and this person was the tiger in Ling Xiaohua's mind. She arranged for two practitioners from the group to act at that time, and everything was arranged, which can be regarded as internal and external cooperation. When the time came, Old Man Pan was very respectfully flattering, but two people came in and fired a few shots at them. As a result, Old Man Pan was finished, and the tiger in Ling Xiaohua's mind was only stabbed half to death. Fortunately, the two people left calmly and were not captured. After Old Man Pan's death, Ling Xiaohua naturally could no longer stay in the Pan family. She still focused on thinking about the tiger in her mind, which need not be detailed. Old Man Pan worked hard for several years, bearing the bad name of a traitor. In the end, he died before his time. After his death, Pei Ying went to search his remaining documents and found two letters that Zhao Letian had written to Pei Ying at the end. Only then did she know that after she wrote that reply, Zhao Letian had written letters to her, but they were intercepted by her father. Although I rejected him so coldly, he still had lingering feelings, and even his criticism was sincere. The second letter said that he would soon hear the news of Zhao Letian's sacrifice for the country, and Zhao Letian really sacrificed for the country soon. Could it be that my cold rejection letter gave him a stimulus and had something to do with his death? (137)

### Using Films to Mobilize the Army

— Zhihua

From Preliminary Knowledge to Highest Technology - Realistic Scenarios, Just Like Battlefield Scenery

Armaments on the silver screen are usually just to seek realism and satisfy the audience's desires. However, according to the recent methods of the United States Department of the Army, they have been practically used in national defense, planning to use film technology to quickly mobilize the national volunteer army in the event of a world war, achieving unexpected victories. These films are called "Army Training Crash Course," demonstrating various necessary skills for being a soldier and fighting. Forty-two films have been produced. The content ranges from preliminary knowledge, such as measuring angles on military maps, to the highest technology, opening a 155mm coastal cannon. All things are real scenes and objects. After watching them, the general public can fully understand military knowledge.

The reason why the Army General Staff is doing this on such a large scale is that modern military knowledge is advancing rapidly. If there is no systematic training in peacetime, it will be difficult to surpass the enemy in wartime. Several years ago, they sent personnel to Hollywood to study photography and invited various film merchants to cooperate. Recently, they have been actively promoting it. Their actors are filled with specially trained troops, and their backgrounds include mountains, lakes, plains, and streets, depending on the subject matter. The finished films, like books, have chapters and sections. For example, the first chapter is called "Infantry Assault, Essentials," describing an infantry team crawling forward to avoid being detected by the enemy. Near the fortress, they dig trenches and quickly occupy it, and then carry out techniques such as attacking the enemy with fire. The second chapter is called "Conditions for Defending a Stronghold," explaining how to deal with tanks with concentrated artillery fire, opening machine guns, and deploying electric nets. Every step is demonstrated in slow motion, with close-ups of important parts and arrows indicating them.

The difference between these films and ordinary ones is that they do not mix in fantasy or gimmicks, or unnecessary stimulation, to avoid losing authenticity. They seriously depict the steps of combat. Even the sounds of guns and cannons are real, and the explosion of distant and near mines is also explained with curve diagrams, shown in slow motion. At the exciting parts of the shooting, there are also shouts of praise from the officers, such as "Good shot," "Good job," "Wonderful," which raise the spirit of the audience. Each film lasts about half an hour, and 30 sets can be produced each year. Currently, the focus is on smoke warfare, field artillery application, military signal release, infantry river crossing, cavalry charge, the subtleties of hand-to-hand combat, the movement of mechanized units, and first aid for wounded soldiers. Therefore, once a war breaks out, the audience in front of the screen can immediately become soldiers on the battlefield.

The long-rumored "The True Story of Ah Q" is the most ambitious play in the charity performance plan for the theatrical world. It was originally scheduled to be co-performed by the Gonghua, Baolian, Jingwu, and Yiyou theatrical troupes around June 15th, but recently it was announced that it would be postponed. The reporter inquired with the persons in charge of the four theatrical troupes and learned the reasons for the postponement as follows:

1.  The venue could not be resolved, because each theater has its own shows to perform on weekdays, and the charity performance requires ten days, so they are unwilling to give up both day and night performances.

2.  Baolian withdrew from the performance, the reason being that they do not have enough free time.

As a result, "The True Story of Ah Q" almost faced the danger of miscarriage. Until yesterday, the drama committee convened the persons in charge of each theatrical troupe to discuss solutions in detail. After careful consideration, it was decided to rent the Golden Theater, and the performance period was rescheduled to between July 22nd and July 30th. As for "The True Story of Ah Q," the Gonghua, Yiyou, and Jingwu theatrical troupes will continue to work hard. Rehearsals are being held non-stop from Monday to Saturday. With this spirit of hard work and perseverance, I think this time, it will definitely not disappoint the gentlemen who are looking forward to "The True Story of Ah Q."

### Jinmen Opens Air Conditioning Today

— Yun

The Jinmen Grand Theater is a palace of film located at the intersection of Foch Road and Avenue Road. Its architecture adopts the latest streamline design of 1939. The clarity of the lines makes every audience feel exceptionally comfortable in terms of perception. In particular, the clarity of sound and light and the spaciousness of the seats have won unanimous praise. Recently, due to the hot weather, the installation of electric fans has the disadvantage of hindering the audience's hearing. Therefore, sparing no expense and spending two months, the latest 1939-style air conditioning equipment was installed. This type of air conditioner uses the latest chemical methods to deliver scientific air conditioning that is suitable for the human body, constantly eliminating the turbid atmosphere in the theater and introducing fresh and clear air. The management of the coldness is also managed by experts who constantly change the degree of the air conditioning, so that every audience member does not feel a special difference when entering and leaving the theater, and there is no harm to the human body. The theater is scheduled to officially open the air conditioning from today (16th), undoubtedly opening a new era in western movie theaters.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

It's a pity that Sun Yukun and Hou Xirui have fallen

Just imagine, with his good abilities in both literary and martial arts, it would be a pity if he continues to fall, especially in today's shortage of Jing (painted-face male) roles. I remember a few years ago, when the son of the late Qing Dynasty's Prince Qing had a birthday in Tianjin, he invited Xiao Lou and Xirui to sing "Lianhuan Tao." After the play, Xiao Lou removed his makeup, washed his face, changed into casual clothes, walked to the master, greeted him, and chatted casually. Because Lao Qing and Xiao Lou were very familiar, and he had been working in the palace for many years, being a favorite in front of the Empress Dowager Cixi, he immediately ordered the princesses around him to open the boxes and take out four gold boxes with the words "Opium" written on them. They were all aged goods, and were all given to Xiao Lou. Xiao Lou accepted them in his hands, naturally full of joy. Who knew that when he arrived backstage and showed them to everyone, Mr. Hou, who was not competitive, looked very familiar with them. He thought that since Huang Tianba could get a share, I, Shi Baoerdun, should also come to the prince, hurriedly ran to the master, kowtowed, and was busy for a long time. But after kowtowing for a long time, no one recognized who he was. Later, after he identified himself, he was rewarded with two silver boxes. Although he was also very proud, everyone else looked down on him. (38)

Old Newspaper Reruns - Sixty-Seven Years Ago (61)

(From this newspaper in June of the 11th year of the Tongzhi era of the late Qing Dynasty)

### San Francisco Bans Chinese Immigrants

The natives of San Francisco resent Chinese guests. The "Meiren Daily" of the port argues, nitpicking all the faults of the Chinese and revealing them completely, and there is even worse. The natives' resentment is deep, and the newspapers echo each other, further spreading rumors and sensationalizing. In the election of gentry and directors in the area, they always consider the arrival of Chinese people in the port to be detrimental to themselves and want to reject them. Therefore, on the second day of the previous month, they gathered the masses for intense discussion. One person first raised his voice to the crowd, saying: "What the Chinese regard as most precious are two things: one is the pigtail that is tied up, if it is cut off, they will consider it the greatest humiliation. The second is transporting the remains back to their hometowns. They must move the bones back to their hometowns even if they die in a foreign land. If we can prohibit the Chinese from growing their pigtails and prevent them from transporting coffins back, advocating these two, then the Chinese can be stopped from coming. Not only that, but the Chinese who are currently in the territory can also be ordered to return home immediately." Another gentleman named Mr. Story said: "From today onwards, we will not hire Chinese as workers." Seeing that their discussion is like this, it is not hard to imagine that the Chinese guests in the port will be treated harshly. With the case discussion concluded, the Six Major Associations, fearing that the Chinese would suffer, immediately sent a telegram to the port, widely informing the Chinese so that they would not come again.

### Purchasing Eastern Carriages

Around Shanghai's Yangjingbang, small carts come and go more and more every day, and those who ride them like them because they are invasive and fast. Now it is heard that the small carriages made in the East are even better than this. Their style is similar to Western two-wheeled carriages, but they are smaller. The matter is quite light, and it is powered by people, without having to drive horses. Westerners in Shanghai are planning to establish a company, collecting 20,000 taels of silver to purchase 9,000 of these carriages from the East, transport them to Shanghai, and rent them to the Chinese for two foreign dollars. If successful in the future, the small cart pullers can switch to pulling Eastern carriages, abandoning the old and seeking the new, and also find food. I think the cart pullers here will definitely not have the worry of unemployment.
