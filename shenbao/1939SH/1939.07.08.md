Zhaoqing: The Chinese force attacking Xinhui reached Qibang and advanced sharply towards the county town. On the 5th and 6th, Chinese shock troops suddenly emerged and repeatedly approached the north gate. Fierce battles with the Japanese are still ongoing in the suburbs. (Dispatch, 7th)

Liudi: On the evening of the 5th, over 500 Japanese soldiers, with six cannons and four speedboats, invaded Chenghai and Hejiang. A certain Chinese unit and local forces met them head-on with fierce attacks. The battle was extremely intense. (Dispatch, 6th)

Zhaoqing: After the Chinese army advanced on Jiangmen, various guerrilla forces rose up in response, launching surprise attacks for several days. The Japanese army was very numerous in the area from Beijie to Waihai Chao. On the 5th, they again rushed into Jiangmen and attacked the Japanese command headquarters at the Jingjiu Hotel, inflicting heavy damage. It is rumored that the Japanese side is holding meetings to prepare to withdraw from Jiangmen. (Dispatch, 7th)

(Guangzhou) Martial law was declared here at 10 a.m. this morning. Sha Ji presents a desolate scene. The number of Japanese soldiers patrolling has greatly increased. There were rumors beforehand that a large number of Chinese people had infiltrated the city, attempting to start an uprising, but no incidents have occurred so far. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)

(Chongqing) The Military Affairs Commission announced that the fierce battles on various fronts in the north and south since this week are continuing to unfold. Japanese offensive attempts have suffered significant setbacks under our mobile warfare. A summary of the battle results is described below:

Guangdong Front: After we abandoned Chao'an last week, we launched a large-scale counterattack this week, now presenting a stalemate. The Chinese army, which successively captured Xinhui Street, Fengyong, and Shengang in the Beijiang area, has continued to advance in recent days with the momentum of splitting bamboo, capturing important strongholds such as Fuhe, Pingshan, and Zhongluotan, with huge gains. As for the Japanese entrenched in Xinhui and Jiangmen in the Xijiang area, they have been repeatedly attacked by our army in recent weeks. On the Xinhui route, after recovering Daxiaomeishan, we captured the county town. On the Jiangmen route, after recovering Jinniushan, we pressed close to the city. On the 30th, artillery bombarded the city walls all day long, causing widespread fires in the city, and heavy Japanese casualties. Another part of our army took advantage of the situation to launch attacks on Foshan from various routes, cutting off Japanese communications. On the night of the 1st, we stormed into the city, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese trapped in Guangzhou, seeing that the war situation for our various armies is becoming increasingly favorable, are experiencing growing psychological unrest among officers and soldiers.

Shanxi Front: Since the recapture of Yuanqu in southern Shanxi, there have been no traces of the Japanese from Pinglu to Yuanqu to the south of Henglingguan. This week, our army launched attacks along the entire Zhongtiao line from Liquan. Currently, one route is pursuing the defeated remnants north of Hengling, and another route stormed into Zhangdian Town, engaging in street battles with over a thousand Japanese soldiers. Another route is pressing on Yicheng, recovering various strongholds in the suburbs. One route controls the southeastern gates of Xia County. During this Japanese invasion of Zhongtiao, their strength was approximately 40,000 troops, with casualties exceeding 8,000 by the end of this week. In eastern Shanxi, the Japanese army, which invaded southward along the Baijin Highway and northward from Anze, has repeatedly engaged our army in battles in various locations, including Quandiang, Zouma Ling, Mapaoquan, Daxiaonanchuan. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely and broke them up in separate attacks, capturing thousands. Currently, the Japanese army invading southward has collapsed and fled towards Taigu and Pingyao, and the Japanese army invading northward has fled back to Anze. The war has entered a stalemate. As for our army in northern Shanxi, it has been attacking Shenchi in recent days, making significant progress. One route attacked Pianguan, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese, and subsequently recaptured the county town of Pianguan, further tightening the Japanese situation.

Shandong and Jiangsu Fronts: The Japanese army in southern Shandong has been invading our Juxian and other places in recent weeks, with great momentum. After being blocked in the area around Zhongxiong and Zhigou, our army used the mountainous terrain to lure the enemy deep and has broken up the Japanese piecemeal. In the past two weeks, the Japanese casualties in that area who invaded us have reached more than 5,000. Their so-called "Southern Shandong Sweep" plan has completely failed. Our army in northern Jiangsu has adopted a strategy of dividing and converging attacks in recent weeks, launching large-scale attacks on the Japanese in Huai'an, Lianshui, and Funing. After several days of bloody battles, Huai'an has now been recaptured. The remnants of the Japanese army in the suburbs of Lianshui have also been largely eliminated by our army, and we have stormed into the city. As for the Japanese in Lianshui, they are still being besieged by us. The battle situation is fierce. Yesterday, they broke through to the east, and after heavy artillery fire, hundreds of Japanese were killed. A part entered the city and defended to the death. We are continuing to attack fiercely.

In addition, important battle results in recent weeks include: Suiyuan advanced on Qingshuihe, Hebei Province besieged Baoding, Henan Province captured Zhongmou County, Jiangnan pressed on Wujin, stormed into Lishui, and recovered Weihu, Anhui Province again defeated over 900 Japanese remnants who invaded northward in Anqing, Jiangxi Province drove out the stubborn enemy entrenched in Meixiaoling northeast of Gao'an and occupied it, Hubei Province again captured the Xingpingpu stronghold, cutting off Japanese communications between Hubei and Jiangxi, and the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian defeated the Japanese army in Yuhuandao Kanmen Town, driving the remnants back to their ships, and repelled the Japanese who attempted to land in Yueqing and Ruian. These are specially reported here as an addendum. (Dispatch, 7th)

### Continuous Night Raids; Large Numbers of Japanese Aircraft Bomb Chongqing; Over a Hundred Bombs Dropped in the Suburbs, Fierce Anti-Aircraft Fire Repelled Them; Many Civilian Residences Destroyed, Church Property Also Damaged; Several Bombs Fell Near the U.S. Embassy and British and American Warships

(Chongqing) Three batches of approximately 20 Japanese aircraft attacked Chongqing again at around 11 p.m. on the 6th. After the Japanese aircraft infiltrated in batches, Chinese anti-aircraft guns bombarded them fiercely. The Japanese aircraft then dropped over a hundred bombs in the suburbs and fled. At that time, a fire started at one location where a bomb hit, but it was quickly extinguished by Chinese military police. (Dispatch, 7th)

(Chongqing) Last night was the second day of continuous Japanese air raids on Chongqing. When the air raid alarm sounded, it was midnight, and residents were awakened from their sleep. Because the sky was overcast and raining, with no moonlight, there was initial suspicion. More than half an hour later, another emergency alarm sounded, and people rushed to air raid shelters to hide. At around 1 a.m., the weather began to clear, and the first batch of Japanese bombers appeared in the sky, circled for several weeks, and then flew away without dropping any bombs. Forty minutes later, the second and third batches of Japanese aircraft arrived one after another. The second batch of Japanese aircraft dropped incendiary bombs in the city, while the third batch dropped high-explosive bombs in the western suburbs. The Chinese anti-aircraft gun units initially did not bombard them, as they had done the day before. Only when the Japanese aircraft appeared over the western suburbs did the anti-aircraft gun units in that area open fire on them. Although there were strong searchlights searching the sky at the time, it was extremely difficult to find the Japanese aircraft due to the dense clouds. Several bombs fell in the middle of Banshan, destroying the storefronts of several shops. A garage was hit by a bomb. In the lower city area, a house under construction was also destroyed. On their way from the north bank to the south bank of the Yangtze River, the Japanese aircraft dropped many bombs, causing several bombs to fall near British and American warships. Many bombs also fell on the south bank. Several bombs also fell near the residence of U.S. Ambassador Johnson. The night before, when Japanese aircraft raided Chongqing, a bomb had fallen approximately 300 yards from the private residence of the U.S. Ambassador. Bai Luni, the acting Chinese secretary of the British Embassy, told a Reuters reporter today that no reports of British property or casualties had been received so far from last night's Japanese air raid. A Reuters reporter went out to inspect at night and saw a very tragic scene. Power lines were damaged, and the entire city was dark. Only a few oil lamps were lit in the corners of the streets, reminding people of the scene from thirty years ago. However, by dawn, the city's lights had been restored. The houses destroyed in the previous air raids looked even more desolate in the dim moonlight. The only things seen in the streets were soldiers clearing rubble, stretchers carrying the dead and wounded, and ambulances carrying emergency teams. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)

(Chongqing) Although the damage from today's Japanese bombing of Chongqing was not great, it was the largest bombing since May 4th. Approximately 60 aircraft participated in the air raid, coming in three batches. One batch appeared at 0:50, two batches appeared at 1:45, and three batches appeared at 2:10. The alarm was lifted at 3:00. The bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft were mostly concentrated at the tip of the peninsula where the Jialing River and Yangtze River meet, especially near the banking district. A fire broke out on the Yangtze River side, destroying Chinese civilian residences about a quarter of a mile long. The business section of the Canadian Church, where foreigners resided, was also threatened. The glass windows and doors of the buildings there were all shattered, and the ceilings were also damaged. The buildings of the Canadian Church's business section and the Associated Press office were also collapsed, but fortunately, Chinese fireboats arrived promptly to rescue them and put out the flames. At the same time, the reason why the fire did not spread was because it was stopped by the high wall of a temple. According to records, during the great fire in Chongqing in 1931, the fire also burned to the walls of the temple and could not develop. Longmenhao (transliteration) on the south bank of the Yangtze River was also hit by several bombs. After the Japanese bombing, many foreigners have not moved there. A bomb also hit near the U.S. Embassy, and several bombs also hit near the British gunboat "Eagle". Several bombs also fell near the British merchant Mackinnie & Company. A fire also broke out near the U.S. Embassy. Several bombs also fell north of the Jialing River, but the damage was minimal. The bombs used by the Japanese aircraft this time were mostly light 50-pound bombs, so their destructive power was not strong. According to foreign aviators, most of the Japanese aircraft are old models. (Associated Press Dispatch, 7th)

Chengdu: At 12:30 a.m. on Wednesday night, there was a sudden air raid alarm, and residents were awakened from their dreams. Fortunately, it was just a false alarm, and the alarm was lifted at 2:30 a.m. A portion of the city walls next to each gate of Chengdu have already been demolished, so leaving the city is not as crowded as before. The plan to build fire lanes in the city has been put into practice, and better preparations have been made for Japanese air raids. Seventy students from the Christian University have left Chengdu in three trucks, planning to use their summer vacation to serve wounded soldiers. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)

(Chongqing) At midnight last night, Chongqing suffered its second nighttime air raid. After the alarm was issued, people all went to air raid shelters to hide. At 11:30 p.m., an emergency alarm was issued. Japanese aircraft were already flying around the city. At 1:45 a.m., the sound of many bombs being dropped was heard, some of which were incendiary bombs. The extent of the damage is not yet known. At 2:45 a.m., the alarm was lifted. (Haitong Dispatch, 7th)

(Chongqing) In the Japanese air raid last night under the moonlight, only 50 civilians died. Because Japanese aircraft came to bomb again this morning, the official statistics have not yet been released. But in any case, the number of dead and injured is definitely not high. Although the searchlights tried their best to search for the traces of the Japanese aircraft last night, it was still difficult to find them. However, the anti-aircraft guns fired as usual. (Associated Press Dispatch, 7th)

(Chongqing) During the Japanese air raid last night, a bomb fell into the river, only fifty feet from the British warship Eagle. Several bombs also fell near the residences of U.S. Ambassador Johnson and U.S. Embassy Counselor Pick. One bomb hit an unfinished air raid shelter, burying thirty people inside. Several incendiary bombs fell on the north bank along the river, setting fire to several poor people's houses, which burned for more than an hour before being extinguished. Because there were city walls separating them, the fire did not spread to the city. The German Embassy suffered slight damage from the fire. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)

### A Japanese Aircraft Crashed in Weinan County

Xi'an: Four Japanese aircraft flew into Shaanxi Province at 6 a.m. on the 6th for reconnaissance. One of them, while flying over Weinan County, experienced mechanical problems and crashed in Chelei Village, west of the railway station. The other three, seeing one crash, circled at low altitude, attempting to rescue and strafed with machine guns. After the aircraft crashed, two Japanese pilots took the opportunity to escape. They are currently being strictly pursued. The aircraft is a Type 97 Model 310 fighter, manufactured in February of the 14th year of Showa (1939). The fuselage is intact, and two machine guns and a parachute were recovered. (Dispatch, 6th)

Lanzhou: Four Japanese aircraft flew into Gansu Province from Shanxi via Shaanxi at 7 a.m. on the 6th, circling over Guyuan for several weeks, then flew east. Then they flew to Weinan for reconnaissance. At that time, one Japanese aircraft crashed near Weinan Railway Station due to mechanical problems. The fuselage was completely destroyed, and one pilot parachuted and landed, escaping. He is currently being searched for by local troops. (Dispatch, 6th)

Editorial

### On Issuing Fractional Currency Notes

Since copper coins have disappeared from the market, small transactions and change have become inconvenient. Thus, measures to cope with the situation have been devised, using stamps and revenue stamps as substitutes. Stamps have a wide range of uses, making them convenient for transfer, but they lose their effectiveness if slightly damaged. Revenue stamps, after being stamped, are effective, so slight smudges do not matter, but their use is not as universal as stamps. In addition, some have issued fractional value vouchers, and others have made tokens, but these are all for temporary relief and cannot be considered as regular measures. Moreover, the impact of the scarcity of fractional currency has invisibly raised retail prices, firstly; small retail shops receive mostly stamps, but need legal tender to buy goods, making exchange inconvenient, secondly; foreign merchants, whether for buying and selling or for taxes, even for amounts of one or two cents, refuse to give change when paid with dime notes, forcing one side to suffer losses, thirdly; beggars have no recourse, and even essential small businesses such as pancakes and fried dough sticks are almost unable to make a living, fourthly; examples are endless. If this situation cannot be improved, retail prices will gradually increase, the livelihood of the poor will become more and more difficult, and the social unrest and insecurity will deepen, which is a cause for concern.

In the modern environment, trying to alleviate the current crisis with hard subsidiary coins is practically impossible. The only solution is to issue fractional currency notes! However, fractional currency notes have not been issued to date. One reason may be that those responsible for printing the notes are unwilling to issue them easily. Another reason is that fractional currency notes and dime notes have different values, but their costs are similar. Therefore, from the perspective of issuing profits, there is hesitation. Moreover, the cost of all printing paper is now more expensive than ever. Perhaps the cost of printing a single fractional note is even higher than one cent. From the perspective of the financial industry, which is meticulous in its calculations, they are unwilling to risk this loss. Thirdly, the smaller the denomination of the currency, the more frequent the transactions, requiring a larger amount. Without prepaying huge sums of money, it is impossible to issue a sufficient amount of notes to meet the needs of society. Fourthly, after the centralization of legal tender issuance, merchants' private notes are prohibited, and legal liability is involved, so who would dare to try it lightly? The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, aware of the inconvenience caused by the lack of copper coins, sent a telegram (12th) in June to the Ministry of Finance requesting relief. This month, it sent another telegram (4th) requesting the Ministry to issue fractional currency notes. Subsequently, the Ministry telegraphed that it had ordered the Central Bank to issue them. Thus, the problem of the lack of fractional currency can be expected to be adequately resolved in the near future.

However, before the issuance, I would like to say a few words. I believe that in addition to one-cent and five-cent notes, two-cent notes should also be printed. The issuance of paper money should also focus on the convenience of use. If two-cent notes are printed, whether the price is three cents, four cents, or even six or seven cents, the convenience of calculation, transfer, and carrying will be better than one-cent notes. This is why there are also two-dime notes among dime notes. The paper quality and printing should be excellent. Small denomination banknotes are beneficial for public use, with frequent transactions. If the paper quality and printing are slightly inferior, they will not only be easily soiled, but also easily torn and counterfeited, which is harmful to circulation and inconvenient for users. It is said that fractional currency notes have been issued in the interior, but they have not achieved the desired effect simply because of poor paper quality and inability to withstand circulation. Although the situation in Shanghai is different from that in the interior (where copper coins are still sufficient for use), the frequency of exchange of goods is also not comparable to that in the interior. The city has suffered from the lack of fractional currency for a long time. Now that it has been decided to issue fractional currency notes, the sooner the better. If printing takes time, then it may be possible to temporarily borrow fractional currency notes already printed by banks in the interior and have them issued by the Central Bank. The use of fractional currency is closely related to the general public's livelihood. Even beggars on the roadside are unable to get a grain of food all day long due to the lack of fractional currency, which shows the profound and widespread impact.

All kinds of evils become deeper and deeper with time. Once they have been around for a long time, they become difficult to reverse. Even if we want to correct them, the effort will be doubled and the result will be halved. The harm of the disappearance of copper coins is as described above. Even if fractional currency notes are issued immediately, it is difficult to say whether the impact of the past month can be swept away and the old situation restored. For example, the rise in the number of zero prices into regular prices will probably not be reduced to zero again due to the issuance of fractional currency notes. The matter seems small, and the number seems small, but the number of transfers between the initial production and final consumption of all goods is often unimaginable. If every transfer is affected by regular zero prices, then the matter is not small and the number is not small. Therefore, for the sake of the vast majority of merchants and people, we cannot but expect the Central Bank, which is responsible for issuing fractional currency notes, to complete its duties as soon as possible.

### Anti-British Demonstrations Held in Japanese-Controlled Area of Tianjin; British Side Believes Negotiations Prospects are Bleak; Japanese Prime Minister Elaborates on Foreign Policy

(Tianjin) Today, the Japanese in their controlled area drove several trucks full of demonstrators around the streets. Anti-British slogans were posted next to the trucks. In addition, twelve Soviet women were detained by Japanese sentries at the intersection of Wilson Street today for five hours. They were released only after the Soviet Consul protested to Japanese Consul Tashiro. (Associated Press Dispatch, 7th)

(Tianjin) A foreigner saw a Chinese corpse outside the British concession, next to an electrified barbed wire fence, who died from electric shock. Since the Japanese side electrified the barbed wire fence, a total of two Chinese people have died from electric shock. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)

(Tianjin) Major General Grasset, the senior commander of the British army in China, arrived in Tianjin this morning from Weihaiwei on the British warship Falmouth. He will inspect the British army in North China. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)

(Tianjin) A Japanese spokesman announced at a press conference today that Japanese residents will hold a mass meeting tonight to urge the Japanese government to take a firm stance on the Tianjin incident. He said that the Japanese authorities do not intend to obstruct various gatherings. It is expected that there will be anti-British mass meetings in various parts of the Chinese area today. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)

(Tianjin) The British military commander in China, Grasset, who recently attended the British-French joint defense conference in Singapore, arrived here today. There have been no major changes in the British and French concession authorities today, but police patrols are more frequent. All playgrounds in the concession are also closed. In addition, a Chinese person was electrocuted on the barbed wire fence near the U.S. Marine barracks. (Associated Press Dispatch, 7th)

(London) According to British government officials, the British-Japanese negotiations next week are bound to fail. Yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi to discuss the Far East issue. It is reported that they discussed the impact of the Tianjin incident on China. Ambassador Guo at the time requested assurances from Halifax that the British side would not yield to Japanese concessions and cooperate with the Japanese in North China. They also discussed the Japanese attempt to undermine the Chinese currency system, which will be an important topic in the British-Japanese negotiations. It is reported that the Japanese side will only discuss general issues in the first few days, and then present its demands to Britain, which the British side may not be able to accept. (Associated Press Dispatch, 7th)

(Tokyo) Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma delivered a long speech at the information conference yesterday, elaborating on Japan's foreign policy. He first mentioned the British-Japanese talks in Tokyo, claiming that the negotiation agenda is limited to the Tianjin incident. Therefore, a complete solution is not possible this time, unless Japan's establishment of a "New Order in East Asia" is the basis for negotiations, only then can a complete solution be hoped for. Japan will never cooperate with countries that obstruct or destroy the New Order in the Far East. Hiranuma continued that if foreign concessions in China maintain absolute neutrality and do not interfere in Japanese military operations, then Japan will respect them. (Haitong Dispatch, 7th)

(London) Newspaper editorials, statistically analyzing the current status of China and Japan and the moral impact of the lessons learned from the Sino-Japanese War on the world, mostly cited Hiranuma's remarks, pointing out that this is an acknowledgement that the Japanese side's original goal of a quick victory has failed. They also said that aggressors around the world should take this as a warning. The Daily Mail concluded that Japan has accomplished one major thing, which is to promote China's unity and unification under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. How much has Japan paid for this accomplishment, and what has it gained? The News Chronicle said that if the political situation in Europe were different from the current situation, then we would have already given active assistance to the Chinese government today. The Japanese army in China cannot advance, and its aggression is also hindered by the Chinese people's own resolute resistance. This is the best time for us to devote our financial resources to help China win, because this victory is not only beneficial to China, but also beneficial to the entire civilized world. The News Chronicle also published a foreign affairs article by Bartlett, a member of the House of Commons, today, saying that Britain is now providing Poland with huge loans. Londoners are now advocating that if the Tianjin negotiations are delayed and ultimately fail as expected, then Britain should use the same method to deal with the Japanese danger. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)

(London) Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax last night to discuss the situation in Tianjin and other matters. Reuters learned that the British government has assured Ambassador Guo that it has no intention of making any concessions on any major issues that will be raised at the Tokyo conference. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)

(London) Regarding the recent restrictions on exports in North China, it is generally believed here that this is due to the Japanese military authorities intensifying their pressure to the extent possible as the Tokyo conference is about to open. Reuters learned that although Britain is prepared to participate in this conference in a very frank spirit, the consular certificate method may also be applied to British imports from North China. This is one of the economic pressures that Britain will consider after it is unable to reason with the Japanese. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)

### English Crewman Regains Freedom

(Tianjin) Griffiths, the second mate of the Taikoo Company's "Yuezhou" steamship, who was detained by Japanese soldiers on Sunday for "improper remarks," was released this morning. The condition for his release was that he not leave Tianjin within a few days. (July 7th, Reuters)

(Tianjin) Mr. Griffey, a British engineer of the Taikoo Company's "Yuezhou" steamship, who was arrested on July 2nd by the Japanese on charges of insulting a Japanese sentry, was released today. However, before his release, he was subjected to torture and forced to sign a Japanese-language letter of repentance. When Mr. Griffey refused to sign this letter, the Japanese forcibly twisted his fingers. After he signed, he was immediately thrown by the Japanese into a small room filled with insects and a suffocating stench. After a night, he was released at 11 a.m. this morning. According to Mr. Griffey, the Japanese accused him of insulting Japanese soldiers, but he personally did not feel that he had insulted them in any way. (July 7th, Associated Press)

(Tianjin) After being released this morning, Mr. Griffey, the second mate of the British ship "Yuezhou," immediately made a preliminary report to the British Consulate and then returned to the ship to rest. A Reuters reporter boarded the ship to visit him, but Mr. Griffey was eager to bathe, change clothes, and shave, so he was unwilling to discuss the details of his experience immediately. The Reuters reporter visited him again in the afternoon. Mr. Griffey said that on Sunday evening, he was walking along Victoria Road and entered a pub. The area was close to where the Japanese had placed obstacles. At the time, he thought he was still in the British Concession and did not realize he had crossed the boundary and mistakenly entered the former German Concession. He only drank a few glasses of whiskey in the pub. He believed that the alcohol must have been strong because he had no memory of what happened after leaving the pub until after midnight when he was awakened by Japanese soldiers at the Japanese military headquarters. The Japanese then interrogated him, accusing him of insulting the Japanese army and adopting a stubborn attitude. He told them that he did not remember his actions while intoxicated. If he had insulted the Japanese army, it must have been because he was provoked first. The next day, Sunday, the Japanese interrogated him again and asked him to sign a Japanese document. The Japanese did not explain the meaning of this document to him. On Tuesday, the Japanese took his photograph. He asked to see a representative of the British authorities, but the Japanese refused, saying that the case was still under investigation. On Thursday, he wrote and signed a statement in English, saying that unless he was drunk, he would not insult the Japanese army, and if he had done so, he was very sorry and would never do it again. Mr. Griffey's release was conditional on him staying on the ship for several days pending further investigation. It is reported that the British authorities have accepted this condition. (July 7th, Reuters)

### Chairman Lin Sends a Telegram of Condolence to the Frontline Soldiers

(Chongqing) Chairman Lin telegraphed Generalissimo Chiang on the 6th to convey condolences to the frontline soldiers and the families of the fallen, stating in brief: "Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, it has been two long years. The battle zones are vast, stretching from north to south, from the coast to the hinterland, from cities to villages. Our national soldiers, under the command of the supreme commander, fight fiercely, disregarding their own safety, and facing death and hardship for the independence and survival of the nation and for the peace and justice of the world. Although it has been two years, their loyalty to the country remains unchanged. Thinking of the brave soldiers who have sacrificed themselves in the battles over the past two years, their bones are exposed in the wilderness, and they have closed their eyes forever, but their noble spirit remains awe-inspiring for thousands of years. The government will commend their loyalty and give generous rewards. We are still afraid that there may be omissions in our searches or delays in reporting, and we cannot rest easy when we think of this. From now on, we must encourage all officials and civilians to care for and provide relief to the families of soldiers who have died in battle, and to be sincere, thorough, and never neglectful. I express my sincere and heartfelt condolences." (July 6th dispatch)

Xie Shoukang, the Chinese representative, delivered a speech entitled "Various Religions in China and Confucianism."

A debate was held at the conference this afternoon, and representatives from various countries raised questions, which Xie Shoukang answered one by one.

### US Supplying War Materials to Japan is Tantamount to Aiding Aggression; Current Neutrality Law is the Root Cause; Borah Coldly Taunts England and France

(Washington) Democratic Senator Hugh Wilson White launched a major attack on the current Neutrality Law at the Public Affairs Association today, stating that Japan's ability to continue its war against China is entirely due to the interference of the US Neutrality Law. Without US aid, Japan's war of aggression against China would have collapsed months ago. Therefore, in the current Sino-Japanese War, the United States is Japan's largest ally because the US supplies 65.57% of Japan's oil, 90.39% of Japan's scrap iron imports, 99.8% of its copper, and 99% of its iron bars. What is inexplicable is that the United States, in the Nine-Power Treaty, had sworn to guarantee China's rights. (July 6th, Associated Press)

(Washington) Famous isolationist Senator Borah today mocked England and France for their dissatisfaction with the US House of Representatives' passage of the arms embargo bill, saying, "England and France often use the terms democracy and dictatorship to gain sympathy, but in fact, England and France were the ones who jointly murdered democratic Czechoslovakia with the dictators. At Munich, what was the difference between democracy and dictatorship? As former Hitler and Chamberlain walked hand in hand, declaring agreement, friendship and trust, where are they now?"

### England Allocates 60 Million Pounds to Assist Countries in Anti-Aggression Group; Purchase of Arms to Strengthen Defenses; Promote National Export Trade; Bill Passes First Reading in Lower House

(London) A bill was introduced in the House of Commons today to assist countries joining the anti-aggression front in purchasing arms and other military supplies, and it has already passed its first reading. The bill, called the "Overseas Trade Guarantee Act," proposes to increase the amount of export credit guarantees from 10 million pounds to 60 million pounds. The Department of Trade may approve allocations depending on the nature of each transaction, or only grant them to businesses operating in the UK. More than half of this 60 million pounds has already been allocated separately during anti-aggression negotiations with various countries, and the funds will mostly be used to purchase arms and military supplies to strengthen the defenses of the countries concerned. All guarantees can only be made at the direction of the Department of Trade. The government decided to promote this bill because it believes that this move will have an important effect on encouraging British export trade, especially benefiting countries currently facing economic difficulties. The transactions are purely commercial in nature and do not involve any loans or loan proposals, as such matters are handled by the Treasury Department rather than the Department of Trade. The bill also stipulates that governments of related countries may sell bonds on the market after being guaranteed by the Department of Trade. The Department of Trade may then use the funds granted by the Treasury Department under the bill to purchase the guaranteed securities. (July 6th, Reuters)

(London) Trade Minister Stanley recently submitted a bill to Parliament this afternoon to increase the total amount of commercial credit loans previously established to promote Britain's general interests from 10 million pounds to 60 million pounds. The interest rate will depend on the type of transaction. This credit loan can only be granted to countries that order goods from factories in the UK. Because certain countries are willing to purchase British goods, but due to their domestic economic difficulties, their purchasing power in the free exchange market has been greatly affected, they can now be granted credit loans, thereby promoting British foreign trade. It is true that some countries in Europe at this time, such as Poland, Romania, and Greece, are negotiating credit loans with Britain. These discussions have not yet entered the final stage, so the exact amount lent to each country is difficult to determine at present. Generally speaking, it is necessary to assist the countries concerned in strengthening their defenses, but it is not intended to take the form of loans, so loans are given for the purchase of British armaments. As for the term of the loan, it is at least two or four years, and at most ten to fifteen years. In addition, if the governments of the countries concerned issue bonds, subsidies will be used to purchase them and sell them to the market at an appropriate time. The intention of this provision is to distinguish loans related to national interests from ordinary commercial loans. Once this bill is passed by Parliament, all countries that maintain friendly relations with Britain can obtain loans. Among the autonomous regions of the British Empire, such as New Zealand, and in other countries such as China, Turkey, Romania, Poland, and Greece, it is particularly important. Generally, the government intends to grant Poland a loan of 15 million pounds. This loan is revolving in nature. In other words, once part or all of it is repaid, it can still be borrowed again to the same extent. (July 6th, Havas)

### British Foreign Secretary Meets with Soviet Ambassador to Promote Mutual Assistance Agreement; British Sends Five Air Force Squadrons to Participate in the Tenth National Day Commemoration This Month

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax recently met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky this afternoon to discuss the current state of talks between England, France, and the Soviet Union. According to political sources, Foreign Secretary Halifax told Ambassador Maisky that every time Britain makes a proposal, it tries to get closer to the Soviet Union's position, but the Soviet Union takes a further step and makes other demands, making it very inconvenient for negotiations to proceed. However, Britain is still determined to continue its efforts to reach an agreement of a general nature. This in diplomatic circles means that Britain no longer requires the Soviet Union to guarantee the neutrality of Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, but insists that the Soviet Union not interpret the meaning of "aggression" too broadly in future agreements. Regarding this level, the Soviet Union's intention is to regard changes in the political system of the guaranteed countries as aggression. Soviet sources here also said that disguised acts of aggression do not necessarily have to openly attack other countries to be successful. The past of Czechoslovakia can serve as a clear example. By analogy, the Baltic countries are also likely to face the same threat, and it is necessary to prevent it. In short, insidious aggression is more cruel than direct aggression and must be prevented. (July 6th, Havas)

(Paris) According to well-informed sources here, the British and French governments have new instructions to their ambassadors to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds and Naggiar, to make further efforts to reach a final agreement on a tripartite anti-aggression pact. It is said that England and France have drafted several plans to respond to the recent demands made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. (July 7th, Reuters)

(Paris) Regarding the issue of England, France, and the Soviet Union concluding a mutual assistance agreement, after the Soviet government proposed a counter-proposal on the 3rd of this month, the British and French governments have jointly drafted a reply. The general gist is that the French Foreign Minister Bonnet and British Foreign Secretary Halifax will separately notify the Soviet ambassadors in Paris and London. According to diplomatic circles in this regard, the British and French governments, in order to meet the demands made by the Soviet side, have considered several ways to enable the two countries' ambassadors to the Soviet Union to make final efforts to conclude a general agreement. If this is not possible, then England and France will probably conclude a narrower agreement with the Soviet Union, or issue it in the form of a joint declaration. It is also possible. (July 6th, Havas)

(London) The Aviation Department recently announced that July 14th is the French National Day, and Britain will send five air force squadrons to Paris to participate in the celebration. These aircraft include the fastest British Air Force Flame-type destroyers, and the famous Eagle Wind-type destroyers, as well as various twin-engine bombers such as Blenheim, Hampden, and Wellington, totaling 52 aircraft. (July 6th, Havas)

(London) The Aviation Department decided to send five air force squadrons to Paris on the 14th of this month to participate in the country's National Day celebrations. The Daily Telegraph commented, "This is the first time that a large British Air Force unit has flown abroad in peacetime. This may be the beginning of reciprocal visits between aircraft and air force personnel from England and France. The army staffs of both countries have repeatedly held talks, and the mutual interests are already clear. The rapid progress of the British and French Air Forces in the past two months is also well known to the world. There is no need to show off force, but the air force pilots and air force base staff of the two countries have not been able to get to know each other, which is still a deficiency. Therefore, this visit will definitely be very beneficial." (July 7th, Havas)

(London) The Air Force Department announced today that it is currently summoning some British Air Force reservists and will continue to summon them for three or four months as a mobilization exercise for testing. The summoned reservists will be trained at this time of year as usual. The test mobilization will be implemented together with the naval exercise in July, the air force exercise in August, and the army exercise in September. (July 7th, Reuters)

### Anglo-Turkish Negotiations Come to an End; Franco-Turkish Negotiations for a New Trade Agreement

Turkish Capital - The British military delegation that came here to conduct military negotiations with the Turkish military authorities has already been here for three weeks. The negotiations have concluded, and they recently departed via Istanbul for the Tatar Strait, preparing to transfer from there to the Turkish military stronghold of Smyrna, to converse with the Turkish Army Chief of General Staff, General Fevzi Çakmak. According to reliable sources, Britain has two requirements in the current negotiations for a mutual assistance agreement: (1) Britain requests to guarantee the borders of Turkey and Bulgaria; (2) Turkey is required to guarantee the borders of Greece and Romania. The second requirement was proposed by Britain, requiring Turkey to guarantee the security of the borders of Romania with the three countries of the Soviet Union, Poland, and Hungary, as well as the security of the borders of Greece with Albania. The latter is directed toward Italy. (July 7th, Hutung Dispatch)

### British Miners' Union Calls for Peace, Common Struggle, Asks for Understanding from German Miners

(London) The British Miners' Union held a meeting in Swansea and decided to broadcast a message of peace to German miners via a secret underground radio station, requesting the understanding of German miners, in the hope of avoiding the threat of war to the people of Europe. The content briefly stated: "The British Miners' Union now reaffirms its fundamental solidarity with you. We now call on the world to resist any policy of aggression. The aggressive policies of dictators are now forcing countries to engage in war. We ask you to help resist aggression from any direction." The call recalled the cooperation and struggle of British and German miners when they participated in the International Miners' Association, and mentioned the efforts of the miners' unions of the two countries to provide relief to miners in various countries. It also said that British and German miners have struggled together for many years, but since 1933, German miners have been forced to separate from the union with other countries and have been subjected to dictatorship. Today, our situation is as dangerous as it was in 1914. We firmly believe in international interdependence and pledge to assist you in your struggle for freedom within your country."

Bulgaria should follow in Germany's footsteps, strive to abolish injustice and inequality, and create a great cause of peace. The Bulgarian people admire the efforts of your head of state to revive the country. Germany's current national construction policy can serve as a mirror for Bulgaria."

### Eden Says British Public Opinion is United; A Major War of Aggression is Inevitable if it Occurs Again in Europe

(London) Former Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in the Limington constituency today, briefly stating, "The will of our people is now completely clear. In short, in addition to preparing to cooperate with other countries to establish an international order, we are also preparing to negotiate with all countries after the threat of force is lifted. But at the same time, we are also determined not to be intimidated by threats, nor to make any concessions in the face of force." In other words, if aggression is seen again in Europe in the future, war will be inevitable. Unless this is understood by the governments of all countries, there will be no hope for improvement in the international situation. (June 6th, Havas Dispatch)

### U.S. Secretary of the Navy Swanson Passes Away; Throughout His Life He Advocated for a Large Navy Policy

(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson passed away today. Swanson was the only naval expert of the Democratic Party. He was born in Swansonville, Pennsylvania, in 1862. His family was poor in his early years and unable to afford education. He dropped out of school at the age of sixteen and once worked as a clerk in a marine supply store. After accumulating some savings, he entered university for further study. Later, during the re-election of the 53rd Congress, he ran for election and was eventually elected. In 1906, he became the Governor of Virginia. In 1916, when Wilson was President, he served as a member of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee and advocated for a large navy policy. He suggested to the government to build sixteen battleships with a huge sum of $500 million. During the European War, he actively advocated for participation in the war. Until after the Paris Peace Conference, members of Congress advocated not participating in the League of Nations, but Swanson was the only one who spoke in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, strongly supporting the late President Wilson's proposal to join the League of Nations, so as to establish a foundation for a collective security system in the world. When Roosevelt took office as President in March 1933, Swanson took over the position of Secretary of the Navy and actively expanded the navy. Recently, Swanson had considered retiring due to his old age and declining health, but unfortunately passed away today, which is truly regrettable. (July 7th, Havas Dispatch)

### Danzig Issue; Poland's Attitude Gradually Becomes Apparent; Based on Four Principles for Germany; Agreement Possible if Open to Negotiation; Chamberlain Postpones Statement

Warsaw - It is heard that after consultations with Britain and France, the Polish government has made a decision regarding the measures to be taken to deal with Danzig's military preparations. According to officially authorized texts published in various newspapers, the Polish side has not sent a note to the Danzig Senate, but the Polish Commissioner in Danzig, Chodacki, may raise the possibility of drawing the attention of the city's authorities to the various provisions of Danzig's defense. Poland does not want to have disputes with the local authorities regarding the nature of Danzig's preparations. It is heard that the Polish government has informed the British and French ambassadors of its decision. (July 7th, Reuters Dispatch)

Warsaw - Regarding the military measures recently taken by the authorities of the Free City of Danzig, the Polish government will send a note to the City Senate within days. According to diplomatic sources here, this note is not a protest, but merely a reaffirmation of the position taken by Poland, and a statement that Britain and France have also expressed their approval. The reason why the Polish government is avoiding lodging a protest is that various military measures in Danzig only have an indirect impact on the interests vital to Poland's survival in practice. If a protest is lodged now, the Danzig City Senate will certainly refute it, pointing out that this is an internal police measure, aimed only at maintaining the city's security. It can be seen that the act of protesting is not only futile, but also enough to incite a violent reaction, so it is better to avoid it. Political figures here recently commented on the matter, saying that the Polish government's attitude is based on the following four principles: (1) The Free City of Danzig should not be annexed into Germany; (2) The city must continue to belong to the Polish customs system; (3) All the rights that Poland possesses in the city, especially the right to freely exercise its rights to the port, docks, wharves, and railways, as well as the right to manage postal services between Poland and the city, must be respected; (4) The German residents of Danzig have the right to free cultural development, which can be recognized by Poland, but on the condition that Polish residents are not harmed. (June 6th, Havas Dispatch)

Danzig - Several artillery positions are currently being installed along the coast between Steegen and Schwanewede. Wartime artillery bases are currently being repaired. The main battery is located in Quillenberg, at the mouth of the Vistula River, facing the town of Boenitzsack. Ammunition has often landed in Quillenberg at night recently. The second battery is located in Hubde. (July 7th, Reuters Dispatch)

Warsaw - The official Polish newspaper, Polska, commented on the Danzig situation today, saying that Germany has formally notified Poland that its cruiser, the Königsberg, will visit Danzig in the near future. The purpose of this move is obviously to calm world opinion. However, there is no doubt that Germany is currently arranging an internal coup in the Free City of Danzig. Therefore, whether the situation eases or not, Poland should be cautious, because Germany's future intentions are in Danzig. (July 7th, Reuters Dispatch)

Warsaw - According to an authoritative source here who told the Associated Press last night, the Polish government is examining news regarding the strength of Danzig's military. "It will consider the attitude to be taken only when authoritative information is received." Rumors that Poland has sent a note to the Danzig government demanding disarmament are completely untrue. "The government also advised Polish newspapers yesterday to carefully publish inaccurate news, "the sources of which are mostly transmitted here from London and Paris."" (July 7th, Associated Press Dispatch)

Warsaw - It is claimed here that the leader of the German Youth Party in Poland, Wiesner, recently submitted a memorandum to Polish Prime Minister General Składkowski, accusing the Polish authorities of using "intimidating measures" against German residents of Volhynia. Wiesner listed many cases of abuse in the memorandum, briefly stating, "The situation in Volhynia is intolerable. We ask the Prime Minister to quickly take the necessary measures to stop the terrorist incidents and enable the German community there to exercise its legitimate functions." (July 7th, Hutung Dispatch)

(London) According to well-informed sources, Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on the Danzig issue, originally scheduled to be delivered in the House of Commons today, has now been postponed to next Monday. The reason for this is that the Polish Ambassador to Britain, Raczynski, has been summoned to return home to report on his duties, and will not be able to return to his post until the evening of that day. London believes that it is more appropriate to issue a statement after hearing the Ambassador's report on his consultations with Polish leaders. (July 7th, Hutung Dispatch)

(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain was originally scheduled to issue a declaration to the House of Commons yesterday, but due to the delay in negotiations between London and Warsaw, he plans to issue it tonight. He intends to announce that if the Polish government engages in war because Germany changes the status of Danzig without its consent, the Anglo-Polish military alliance will immediately take effect. The original draft of the declaration was approved by the British Cabinet yesterday and has been sent to the Polish government for review. It is said that the Polish government has requested a revision to a section of the declaration, namely Chamberlain's proposal that Poland and Germany negotiate the Danzig issue. However, a British government spokesman denied that Britain was attempting to advise Poland to begin negotiations with Germany on the Danzig issue. The Polish side pointed out last night that the Polish government is in agreement with Britain and France, and has provisionally decided that Poland will not send a note to the Danzig Senate demanding that "the National Socialist Party remove the military installations in the Free City." The reason why Poland has taken this surprising decision is that Poland wishes to avoid overlapping protests, since Poland, Britain, and France have already stated their positions and there is no need to make any further protests. (July 7th, Associated Press Dispatch)

### President Roosevelt Restores Monetary System Privileges; Treasury Continues to Purchase Silver from Abroad; Prices Change According to the Situation

(Washington) The reports of the Senate and House of Representatives on the monetary system conference were delivered to the White House yesterday and personally approved by U.S. President Roosevelt. After the U.S. President signed the document, his power to devalue silver dollars was immediately restored. Also, after the President signed the document, the domestic silver price of 71.11 cents, previously designated by the Treasury Department, immediately came into effect. (July 7th, Associated Press Dispatch)

(Washington) According to Senator Adams today, the Senate Banking and Currency Subcommittee is scheduled to consider the Treasury Department's refusal to purchase foreign silver tomorrow. According to Senator Taft, there is a possibility that the refusal to purchase foreign silver bill will be passed, but there is probably no hope of passing it during the current session of Congress. (June 6th, Associated Press)

(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently made a statement to the newspapers, saying that the Treasury Department is scheduled to resume purchasing silver from abroad starting today, and has consulted with the State Department to notify the Canadian federal government, informing it that the agreement previously signed with the United States (where the United States purchases 1.2 million ounces of silver from Canada each month) continues to be valid. As for other countries, the United States has not signed contracts similar to the U.S.-Canada silver purchase agreement with them. Also, the Exchange Equalization Fund was not used during the period when the President's monetary powers were suspended. (June 6th, Havas Dispatch)

(Washington) The Treasury Department decided today that the purchase price of foreign silver will be 36.75 cents per ounce. This price was originally above 43 cents, but was repeatedly reduced to 38 cents, and is now being lowered again. According to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, the Treasury Department will resume the purchase of foreign silver starting this afternoon (Eastern Standard Time). The State Department has notified Canada that the monthly silver purchase agreement will be restored to its original state. Morgenthau also said that he is extremely satisfied with the legitimacy of expanding the government's monetary powers. Regarding the future policy on purchase prices, the Treasury Department will temporarily base it on a daily basis. The new domestic silver price is 71.11 cents per ounce. (June 6th, Reuters Dispatch)

(Washington) According to U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau today, the Treasury Department's purchase price of foreign silver will inevitably change daily until the world silver situation is obtained. As for now, the Treasury Department is not prepared to support the world's silver market, but only to support normal market activities. The purpose of this measure is to prevent silver remittances to the U.S. from various parts of the world, and at the same time, it may accelerate Mexico's actions. (June 6th, Associated Press Dispatch)

### European Markets Unaffected

### No Profit to Be Made from Mexican Silver Exports

Mexican Capital - After the U.S. Treasury Department reduced the purchase price of foreign silver to 36.75 cents per ounce, a local mining expert recently made a statement to a Havas News Agency interviewer, commenting, "At the U.S. Treasury Department's original purchase price of 38 cents per ounce, small-scale silver mines in Mexico could barely cover production costs. Now that the U.S. has reduced the purchase price to 36.75 cents, at least 20 silver mines in Mexico will be forced to shut down. For now, the only solution is for the Mexican government to exempt silver export taxes, but government revenue will be reduced as a result, making the solution extremely difficult."

### Swatow Puppet Regime Takes the Stage: "Maintenance Society" Performs at Yongping Building; Japanese Use Impoverished Refugees as Tools; British Ship Arrives in Swatow, Passengers and Cargo Cannot Disembark

Swatow Correspondence: After the Japanese army occupied Swatow City, naval landing forces successively disembarked and were stationed from Wai Ma Road to the area in front of the Customs House. West Dike, Tongji Road, Huilan Bridge, and the Railway Station were also guarded by Japanese sentries. The citizens all closed their doors and dared not go out. Those who escaped to Jiaoshi were relatively free, but unfortunately, there was a lack of food and rice, so they could not hold out for long. The Japanese instigated Chen Juemin to act as the head of a bogus security maintenance society, and summoned the hooligans who had not retreated to Yongping Building for a meeting. However, no one with any self-respect participated. A Japanese flag and a five-colored flag were planted at the entrance of Yongping Building. By 4:00 PM, not a single person had entered. In a short while, the Japanese army, seeing that no one was participating, sent military police to capture one or two hundred refugees from the streets and alleys who were ragged and had no money to escape. Yang Jixiang, who claimed to be the "Chief of the Political Affairs Section of the Guangdong Security Maintenance Society," presumptuously acted as chairman and gave a speech in Taiwanese, urging the refugees to quickly resume their businesses and restore public order. Someone asked him how to do it. Yang said that they were given three days to open their shops, and to use Japanese military scrip, with each yuan worth one yuan and three jiao in legal tender. That day, staff members from the Tongmeng News Agency participated and took photographs. Because the refugees participating in the meeting were mostly wearing short clothes and were barefoot, the Tongmeng News Agency photographers ordered them to stand in the second row. The puppet show then came to a close. Also on that day, the British warship, protecting the Jinan, a ship coming from Shanghai to Swatow, entered the harbor and docked at the Swire Wharf on the West Dike. The Japanese army quickly dispatched sentries in the area in front of the Customs House, forbidding idlers to pass the dike to meet the ship, and also prohibited boats from approaching. Japanese soldiers, armed with machine guns, were stationed on both sides of the wharf, not allowing passengers or cargo on the Jinan to disembark. There were 5,200 pieces of cargo and passengers, both men and women, but no one could get onto the wharf. After docking for four hours, the ship returned to Hong Kong. At that time, the sea was very dangerous. There were four British and American warships in Swatow, ordered to protect the property rights of foreigners. The British ship decided to continue sailing as usual, knowing that the mail, passengers, and cargo on board could not disembark, but would not give up their Far East shipping rights because of this. The main force of the Japanese army has now shifted to the Chenghai and Raoping areas, with one hundred Japanese naval vessels gathered in the north and south ports. The Japanese aircraft carrier is anchored off Nanao Island. A giant aircraft takes off from time to time for reconnaissance. In addition, more than thirty Japanese aircraft in batches flew to the upper reaches of the Han River to drop bombs. Liuhuang, Xindu, Tankou in Fengshun, the area near Xingning city, the Meixian highway bus station, Tangkeng in Jieyang, Fengxi and Fuyang in Chao'an were bombed with more than four hundred bombs. Xingning suffered the greatest losses. In Fuyang and Caitang, three to four hundred people were killed or injured. Many houses were destroyed in Meixian. However, two Japanese aircraft were shot down by the Chinese army, one crashed in the wilderness near Luoyita on the Meishe Road, and the other has not been found. The Chinese reinforcements have arrived successively, and a major battle should soon unfold.

### Great Battle in Lianshui County; Chinese Troops Bravely Charge into the City Twice; Japanese Force Fleeing South Gate Surrounded

Taixian Correspondence: The Chinese army launched an attack on the city strongholds of Lianshui and Huai'an. Starting on June 26, the various routes of the army were launched simultaneously, morale was greatly boosted. In addition to the attacking troops proceeding according to the battle plan, the various units blocking Japanese reinforcements also arrived at their designated routes and set up ambushes, preparing to intercept. On the night of June 26 at 12:00 AM, the Chinese army took advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness and rushed into Lianshui County in one fell swoop, engaging the Japanese army in street fighting. Later, the Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, retreated to the Yellow River embankment outside the South Gate to hold their ground and await reinforcements. The main force of the Chinese army was continuing to advance when the Japanese army, utilizing its rapid transportation, arrived in Lianshui as reinforcements on the morning of the 27th before the Chinese army. The small number of Chinese troops who had recovered Lianshui engaged in a fierce battle with the arriving Japanese army. At the same time, the Japanese army dispatched several aircraft to assist in the battle and used intense artillery fire to suppress the Chinese army. The Chinese army, caught in a two-sided attack, fought bitterly for about ten hours. Finally, due to excessive casualties, while the Japanese army had also been killed more than one hundred men, they reluctantly withdrew from Lianshui City at noon on that day and confronted the Japanese army outside the city. The main force of the Chinese army also continued to arrive and launched repeated assaults on the Japanese army, without interruption. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the Chinese officers and soldiers not only did not show any fatigue, but became more courageous as they fought. At 2:00 AM on the morning of the 30th, the Chinese army sent out a brave team of sixty men, who scaled the city wall again and attacked Lianshui City, capturing the city gate and opening it. The large contingent of the Chinese army then surged in, engaging the Japanese army in another intense street battle. However, the Japanese army tenaciously defended the various civilian houses in the city. The Chinese army mostly threw hand grenades into the houses, which resulted in a mixed battle situation. Meanwhile, under the cover of intense fighting, they demolished two large sections of the city wall, leaving the Japanese army with no fortifications to rely on. Until the evening, the battle had not ceased. That night, reinforcements of the Chinese army continued to arrive, and morale increased even more. They drove the Japanese army in the city to the northeast corner of the city, where they defended the various civilian houses and stubbornly resisted. The Chinese army then occupied the southwest gates and occupied and blockaded the various streets and alleys, forming a confrontational situation with the Japanese army. As of the afternoon of the 1st of this month, the Japanese army was still digging gun emplacements in the various civilian houses and firing at the Chinese army. The Chinese army again selected a brave team on the 1st to launch an assault on the civilian houses occupied by the Japanese army, but failed. However, the various reinforcements of the Japanese army have been blocked and intercepted by the Chinese army, and cannot be supplied. Their ammunition and supplies will all be cut off. As for the Japanese force that fled outside the South Gate, it has already been surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army.

### Japanese Army in Yangxian Forcibly Conscripting Men Door-to-Door; Japanese Army in Shaobo Holds Sports Meet; Firecrackers Destroy Japanese Flag

Taixian Correspondence: There are currently about three hundred Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Yangzhou. Among them, the Japanese military police team has been forcibly conscripting men door-to-door, even arresting family members to coerce exchanges. The Japanese army in the Fairy Temple has also recently been divided into six groups, each with eight Japanese soldiers, led by a Japanese officer, who conduct house-to-house searches in the town after 3:00 PM, forcing young people aged fifteen to twenty to join the "Youth Defense Corps," causing the people to panic and flee. Therefore, the situation in Yangxian is extremely chaotic. The Japanese army in Shaobo held a sports meet one morning at the headquarters parade ground. In the center of the parade ground stood a flagpole with a five-colored puppet flag hanging on it. Each of the four corners was hung with a small German, Italian, Japanese, and five-colored puppet flag. At the opening ceremony, the Japanese army set off dozens of firecrackers. Unexpectedly, the first one to rise into the air immediately detonated one of the Japanese flags. The Japanese army, upon seeing this, were all distraught, and all believed it to be an ominous sign for the future of the military.

### Japanese Army in Kunshan Ambushed Outside the West Gate; Heavy Losses Reported

Kunshan Correspondence: The Japanese army stationed in Kunshan, based on a false report from the traitor Wang, that guerrillas were planning to attack Kunshan, the Japanese captain immediately dispatched a large number of Japanese soldiers to search the residences to prevent guerrillas from hiding. That night, security was tight, and a special curfew was imposed for three consecutive days. As no guerrillas came to attack, the Japanese army's defense gradually relaxed. The Japanese captain was furious that Wang had falsely reported military information and severely punished him. Unexpectedly, at this time, the guerrillas suddenly attacked Kunshan City with lightning speed. The Japanese army, in a state of panic, sent troops to meet the attack. However, the guerrillas did not reach the city and retreated to the × village outside the West Gate. The Japanese army pursued the guerrillas to the vicinity of × village, where the guerrillas ambushed there suddenly surrounded the Japanese army on three sides. In a short time, the sound of machine guns was dense, and the Japanese army found it difficult to cope. After an hour of fierce fighting, the Japanese army finally broke through the encirclement and retreated to the outskirts of the city. It is reported that the losses were heavy.

### Cargo Truck on the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway Burned Down; Cash Also Robbed

Taihui Correspondence: Cui Xiangcheng, a Suzhou native, ran the Yan Yuan Transportation Company for over a year, and the business was still acceptable. Recently, he added a new truck for 9,000 yuan, loaded with goods for Shanghai, and carried 20,000 yuan in cash. The day before yesterday, when passing between Taishi and Jiading on the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway, he was suddenly robbed. Goods worth about 50,000 yuan were completely lost. When Cui Xiangcheng heard the report, he sent people to inquire about the matter, but there was no news. Both trucks have been burned down. Yan Yuan has suffered such a loss and has now suspended operations. Other transport companies, hearing this news, dare not rashly travel on the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway, and regard it as a dangerous road.

### Under Special Guard in the Two Concessions; Yesterday Passed Peacefully; Precautions Removed Everywhere This Morning; Police Arrested 500 Suspects Yesterday

Yesterday, the authorities of the two concessions in this city implemented emergency precautions. All entertainment venues and shops along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, facing the French Concession, were temporarily closed. Yesterday was peaceful throughout the day. The precautions have been removed starting today. Details are recorded below:

The precautions between the roads of the Public Concession and the French Concession ended at 10 PM last night. Because no unexpected incidents occurred and order was stable, it was announced that the curfew would be lifted. All obstacles piled up on the main roads, except for the border areas of the concessions and the junctions, were maintained in their original state and have been successively removed, restoring normalcy. However, the volunteer corps, etc., still patrolled within the boundaries, and inspections after the curfew were still strictly enforced.

Strictly Enforcing Curfew Laws

This city has implemented a curfew law since the war, stipulating the time from 12:30 AM to 6:00 AM the next morning. It has not been canceled to date. However, because it is now summertime and dawn comes earlier, the concession authorities have allowed pedestrians to pass through at 4:30 AM the next morning. In practice, the curfew time has been shortened. However, yesterday morning, due to the precautions, even after 4:30 AM, the French Concession still did not allow pedestrians to pass on the roads, and they were all blocked at the entrances of the alleys. Even vegetable vendors were prohibited from entering the market. It was not until 5:45 AM that they were allowed to walk. The French Concession tramcars were also delayed until 5:30 AM before leaving the factory.

Setting Up Barbed Wire, Blocking Traffic

In the areas adjacent to the British and French Concessions, from the Bund to the Western District, except for the Bund, Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Henan Road, Zhengjia Muqiao, Zhejiang Road, Yu Qiaqing Road, Mahou Road, Chongqing Road, Tongfu Road, Seymour Road, and other places, which retained entrances and exits, all other places, such as Zhu Baosan Road, Dagou Bridge, Xixin Bridge, Beile Road, Luzon Road, and other places, were all set up with barbed wire to cut off traffic. As for the entrances and exits, all vehicles and pedestrians were guarded by armed detectives and subjected to searches.

Troops from Various Countries Assisting in Guarding

At the same time, all personnel of the police departments of the two concessions, the defense forces of Britain, America, and Italy, and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were all dispatched, with police cars, armored cars, and patrol teams traveling back and forth on the major roads. English and Scottish troops, either on foot with live ammunition or patrolling in armored vehicles, were stationed east of Yu Qiaqing Road, American troops patrolled west of Yu Qiaqing Road and south of Rue Robert, Italian troops patrolled north of Rue Robert, and French troops and Annamese soldiers patrolled in various districts of the French Concession.

Entertainment Venues All Closed

All entertainment venues in the two concessions, such as the Great World, New World, Yong'an Tianyun Building, Sincere Amusement Park, New New Garden, Great New Amusement Park, Golden Grand Theatre, Gongwutai Theatre, and other theaters and entertainment venues, were closed for one day yesterday. Dance halls, except for a few such as Great New, were also closed. Movie theaters operated as usual, but business was unusually quiet. Because all citizens were unwilling to go out during this special curfew.

Shops Closed on Avenue Edward VII

Shops and residents along the border of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, facing the French Concession, received temporary notices from the police station that all doors were not allowed to be opened, and it was announced that business would be suspended. Such as the Grand Hotel, etc., posted the following notice at the entrance: "By order of the French Police Station, there is a special curfew today. Traffic to our store will temporarily be through the back door. As for those without a back door, please install one on the folding door." Also, the iron gates of Baoyu Lane, Taiyuan Fang, Hongyun Fang, and other places along Avenue Edward VII were all closed by the police station.

Japanese Blockade the Huangpu River Traffic

Japanese troops and puppet police in the four suburban areas of Shanghai also increased their checkpoints and patrols, searching pedestrians. Traffic on the Huangpu River was completely blocked yesterday. Vessels traveling in the areas of the South Huangpu, Tangkou, Wangjiadu, Zhagang, Dujiahang, Yexie, Minhang, and Zhujing were all suspended. Waterway traffic in the upper reaches of the Suzhou River, in the areas of Beixinjing and Yujidun, was also blocked. No ships were allowed to enter or exit. On the one hand, ships were searched. Although the east-west ferries on the Huangpu River were still operating, there were few passengers.

Peaceful Throughout the Day, Precautions Removed

Yesterday, the situation in the city was very calm. People from all walks of life were able to pay attention to their spirit and deal with it calmly. Therefore, the order was peaceful throughout the day. It is reported that the concession authorities have removed this emergency curfew at 0:30 AM this morning. However, ordinary security work will still be carried out as usual.

Chinese, Western, and Indian Police All Dispatched

The Public Concession Police Department, starting at 3:00 AM yesterday morning (July 7), temporarily and urgently imposed a curfew, ordering all Chinese, Western, and Indian mounted and foot detectives of the affiliated police stations to go on duty from the beginning of the curfew and conduct meticulous guard in their respective jurisdictions. All passing pedestrians and vehicles were subject to searches. The reserve team of police officers and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were also ordered to assemble separately, ready to go on duty and assist when necessary. Barbed wire was mostly set up at the intersections of Avenue Edward VII and the French Concession. Security was particularly tight and searches were more thorough on the bridges over the Suzhou River. In addition, traffic was temporarily suspended on several bridges. As for the Northern District, all iron gates near the railway station at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Aierjin Road, and at the intersections of Kaifeng Road and Rehe Road bordering Zhabei, and the eastern side of North Henan Road were all closed. Therefore, the tramcars passing through the Northern District all shortened their routes. Trolleycars on routes 5, 6, and 7 were changed to terminate in front of the courthouse on North Zhejiang Road, and trackless trolleycars on route 18 used the south end of Xizang Road Bridge as a turnaround station. The same was true for the division between the Chinese and concession areas in western Shanghai. The predetermined time for this curfew was until midnight tonight. During the curfew, all public entertainment venues, such as amusement parks and dance halls, were notified by the police authorities to cease business in order to prevent villains from mixing among them and disrupting order. In addition, the gatekeeping of the First Special Court was also more strict than usual. Those entering and leaving the court in the morning were mostly subject to searches. The deployment of British and American defense forces stationed in the court was therefore slightly more frequent due to the tense defense in the Northern District.

Emergency Precautions in the French Concession

The French Concession authorities, in order to maintain the security of the foreign residents, businesses, shops, and residents in the concession and to prevent unscrupulous elements from mixing in and causing trouble, opened the more important Xinqiao Street, Jixiang Street, Mintiniyin Road, Luzon Road, and Shengmuyuan Road at the intersections of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch at midnight the night before, to facilitate vehicles and pedestrians. All other intersections were blocked by barbed wire and piles of obstacles to cut off traffic. Soldiers of the French army stationed in Shanghai were divided into groups to patrol the roads and streets in the concession. At the same time, the police department ordered its affiliated police stations to dispatch Chinese, French, Vietnamese, and Russian detectives armed with weapons to patrol and investigate in sections on the various roads, and armored vehicles were dispatched to travel throughout the concession to maintain law and order.

Volunteer Corps Also Out on Defense Yesterday

The concession authorities, in order to maintain the security of the concession and prevent unexpected events from occurring, took special precautions for one day yesterday. After receiving a secret order from the regimental headquarters the night before, all officers of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were on standby in full uniform, awaiting orders to be dispatched. Multiple vehicle and foot patrol teams were organized yesterday to patrol Fuzhou Road, Henan Road, Jiangxi Road, Tianjin Road, Zhejiang Road, Jiujiang Road, Beijing Road, Guangdong Road, Guangxi Road, Guizhou Road, Avenue Edward VII, the Bund, and other places. The teams were commanded by Battalion Commander Chen Shixia, with officers Li Yushu, Wang Tingkui, Zhou Qing'en, Xu Shaomei, Zhong Yuting, Xia Zaiyu, Zhang Tinggui assisting in all matters. The weather was hot that day, but the members of the team were enthusiastic to serve and eager to participate, and did not consider it a hardship. They began to withdraw from around 4:00 PM until midnight.

Western Newspapers Report Gunfire in Western Shanghai

The English-language China Press stated that military police were out on the streets today (the 7th) in both concessions, especially the French Concession. Aside from traffic inconvenience, there was little for Shanghai to complain about today. A small amount of propaganda leaflets were discovered. The barricading plan and other mobilization measures adopted were little changed from recent ones. However, there was one major exception, namely that since 11:00 PM last night, the doors on the French Concession side of Avenue Edward VII have been

Closed across the board

Around 10:00 PM last night, there were six gunshots on Route de Ghisi, causing some disturbance.

Political Stance

It was irrelevant. Leaflets were also found in the Jing'an Temple area, but in small numbers. Some were anti-Japanese in nature, and others were leaflets promoting the new order and the peace movement. British troops patrolled some parts of the central and Laoza districts.

### Unified Government Bonds Principal and Interest to be Paid at the End of July; Reconstruction Bonds to be Drawn for Principal Repayment the Day After Tomorrow; Payment Date August 31st

The Ministry of Finance has always been consistent in maintaining its creditworthiness. The principal and interest of domestic and foreign debts paid since the war have reached 530 million yuan. However, most domestic and foreign debts are guaranteed by customs and salt taxes, which have long been seized. By the end of last year, the debt payments advanced had reached 175 million yuan. Although declarations were made on January 15th and March 26th of this year that the customs and salt tax guarantees for various debts would be subject to separate repayment methods due to the circumstances, efforts are still being made to maintain domestic and foreign debts. A method has been determined for the repayment of principal and interest of unified government bonds due at the end of July. The relevant methods will be announced by the Ministry. A reporter from the New Life News Agency learned from the Central Bank and the informal securities market that the unified method of repayment of principal and interest is expected to arrive in Shanghai in the middle of this month, and payment can be made on schedule at the end of July.

### Foreign Exchange Applications for Various Industries to be Reviewed and Processed in Chongqing; Shanghai's Situation is Special, Application is Problematic; The Shanghai Branch of the Bank of Communications has not yet Received Orders to Handle Applications; Foreign Banks Restrict Foreign Exchange Swaps

After the Ministry of Finance announced the rules for applying to purchase foreign exchange for imported goods, it established a Foreign Exchange Review Committee in Chongqing. Applications from various industries will be processed in Chongqing, and after approval, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will sell the foreign exchange. Foreign banks are restricting swaps to prevent speculation. Details are as follows:

Review Committee to Process in Chongqing

Regarding imported goods operated by importers that are not on the prohibited import list and are necessary for the country, applications to purchase foreign exchange may be made to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee in accordance with the regulations set by the Ministry. A reporter from the New Life News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Foreign Exchange Review Committee is located in Chongqing and is directly under the Ministry of Finance. If various industries wish to apply, they must apply to the committee in Chongqing or entrust a bank to forward the application. After approval, the committee will issue a special permit to purchase foreign exchange and designate the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to handle it. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will then sell the foreign exchange at the legal rate, but the applicant must pay a balancing fee based on the difference between the legal rate and the exchange rate quoted by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications.

Application Method; Bank of China and Bank of Communications Quotes

Application form: (1) Applicant, (2) Purpose, stating the tariff number, commodity name, country of origin, quantity or weight, value, port of departure and date, import location, sales location and date, (3) Foreign exchange currency and amount requested, specifying the currency type, amount, date required, or listing the purpose and date, place of remittance, (4) Documents, (5) Remarks. The applicant must sign, stamp, date, and state the location. Regulations stipulate that the applicant must submit the original special permit to purchase foreign exchange to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee for cancellation when the foreign exchange purchase is completed. It is reported that the Bank of China and Bank of Communications quote an exchange rate of seven pence for the British pound and 13.625 yuan for the US dollar.

Shanghai's Special Situation; Implementation Problems

Shanghai is a sinking area for Chongqing, and customs revenues have been intercepted, forcing a change of flag. Therefore, the implementation of the prohibition of imported goods has become a problem. The Ministry of Finance is concerned whether it will still provide legal foreign exchange for necessities and non-prohibited goods transported to Shanghai and other areas in the occupied zone. Now, the Central Bank has been ordered to stop foreign exchange applications, and from now on, only legal price quotes will be announced. Applications from various industries will be processed in Chongqing, but whether Shanghai industries can apply is not mentioned in the telegram. Moreover, the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications has not received orders from the head office to handle foreign exchange applications. However, according to observations by foreign banks, if goods are transported to Shanghai, it may not be possible to apply for legal foreign exchange.

Restricting Swaps; Preventing Speculation

A reporter from the New Life News Agency learned from foreign merchant banks yesterday that in foreign exchange transactions, if the buyer cannot complete the transaction on the date specified in the contract, they should request the seller (bank) to roll over all or part of the purchased foreign currency. This rollover is called a "swap". Now, various foreign merchant banks, due to the shortage of cash in the black market and the large-scale manipulation of futures by Chinese and foreign speculators without financial strength, have decided to strictly restrict swaps to prevent speculative manipulation and to stabilize the black market. It is reported that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation continues to maintain foreign exchange in Shanghai's black market, and the exchange rate remains stable, with the British pound at six and a half pence and the US dollar at 12.625 yuan. It is reported that the British side has recently expressed its support for the legal currency and is determined to do so. Therefore, foreign merchant banks are restricting swaps to avoid losses, which also indicates a bullish outlook for the legal currency.

Legal Foreign Exchange Always Maintained

Although the foreign exchange settlement method has changed, all foreign exchange purchases and sales are still based on the legal exchange rate. This will not be shaken by the change in the foreign exchange settlement method. Banks can have large or small quoted prices, which means that import and export merchants can enjoy a difference in the exchange rate and pay a balancing fee of varying amounts. If the exchange rate is lengthened, the balancing fee paid by importers is small; conversely, it is large. If the exchange rate is shortened, the exchange rate difference enjoyed by exporters is large; conversely, it is small. The settling bank uses the legal exchange rate, which means that the balancing fee from importers pays for the exchange rate difference for exporters. Therefore, when importers pay more balancing fees, exporters enjoy more exchange rate differences. This stimulates the increase of native exports, so the legal exchange rate is always maintained.

### Curbing the Activities of Hoodlums in Western Shanghai; No Definite Solution Yet; Hoodlums are the Worst Criminals; Incited by Others to Do Evil

The China Press reports that after armed hoodlums fired on public concession police patrols from the "Great Way" area last Saturday and Sunday, police officers equipped with Thompson submachine guns continued to patrol Yidingpan Road in armored vehicles. It is reported that the British army, police, and Japanese gendarmes responsible for peace and order in the Western District have been meeting almost daily. Although no definite solution has been found yet, it has been learned that the hoodlums have nothing to do with the "Great Way" authorities or Wang Jingwei's bodyguards. The hoodlum gang is a large group of well-armed, the worst criminals, most of whom have been imprisoned in the Ward Road Jail more than once, and are now still being funded and incited by others to do evil.

### US Flagship Returns to Shanghai Early; To Greet the New Commander; Commander Yarnell Arrives by Ship; Turnover Ceremony to be Held in Shanghai

The China Press reports that the US cruiser Augusta suddenly changed its scheduled itinerary. Yesterday (the 6th), US naval authorities in Shanghai announced that the flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet would carry Fleet Commander Admiral Yarnell and arrive in Shanghai from Qingdao on July 18th. Naval circles in Shanghai could not explain this sudden change of itinerary. It is known that the Augusta left Shanghai on June 8th and sailed to the waters off North China, scheduled to return to Shanghai in the fall. However, it is widely believed that

Flagship Returns to Shanghai

it is to greet Admiral Hart, who will arrive in Shanghai around July 27th to replace Admiral Yarnell. Therefore, the US naval ceremony for the change of command of the Asiatic Fleet will likely be held in Shanghai. Admiral Hart originally planned to take the Commander's private yacht, the Isabel, to a port in North China to hold the ceremony after arriving in Shanghai. The Augusta is now docked in Qingdao and will soon set sail for Shanghai. Also, the US Navy transport ship Henderson is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from North China on July 11th

Arriving in Shanghai

and will remain docked until July 21st. When the ship arrives in Shanghai on Sunday next week, it will dock for 24 hours to carry 178 replacement soldiers for the US Fourth Marine Regiment here. This time, it will set sail from Qinhuangdao, carrying two companies of US Marines who have been trained at the Holcomb Barracks there. On July 21st, it will leave Shanghai and return to the United States, carrying US Navy and Marine Corps personnel whose Eastern service has expired.

### Guangdong Wheel Steamer Safely Arrives in Shacheng

In response to the request of fellow Wenzhou natives in Shanghai, the Guangdong Wheel Steamer, carrying fellow Wenzhou natives, sailed to Shacheng on its way to Hong Kong the day before yesterday. According to a New News Agency reporter, the ship has arrived in Shacheng, and the passengers have safely disembarked and transferred to Wenzhou.

### American Women in Tianjin Also Subject to Inspection; American Business Almost Completely Stalled; Strong Negotiations Requested in Washington

The Continental News reports that foreign nationals in this port have received private letters revealing that American women in Tianjin are also subject to the same insults as British nationals in the British Concession there. However, no foreign news agencies have reported this news in the newspapers here. The editorial of the Millard's Review, to be published tomorrow (the 8th), will criticize these letters received in this port. According to the letters,

Two American Women

were inspected in front of roadblocks. One was Mrs. Mitchellson, whose husband works for General Motors in Japan, and the other was the wife of Mr. Riggles, an employee of the Japanese branch of Standard Oil. These two American women took a train to Beiping on June 16th. When they passed in front of the roadblocks, they were ordered to be inspected by Japanese sentries. Two days later, on June 18th, Mrs. Finke, the principal of the American School in Tianjin, and her twelve-year-old daughter also

Country Club

were inspected while passing the roadblocks. The girl was so frightened that she was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Furthermore, Mrs. Sherlfberg was inspected before being allowed to pass the roadblocks. American firms in Tianjin have requested strong negotiations in Washington regarding the Japanese interference with their business. American people living outside the concession have also been detained for a long time and subjected to inspection and humiliation. Chinese servants of American firms, when going to their places of employment,

In Front of Roadblocks

were detained for half a day in many instances. Even Japanese customers of American firms have encountered this experience. The obstruction of American firms' goods in front of roadblocks and the restrictions on remittances have almost completely stalled business. The American Chamber of Commerce in Tianjin has requested its members to prepare detailed reports on the Japanese interference with their business in order to draw the attention of the American authorities to these incidents.

Always Reported

Why do foreign news agencies, which reported on the insults to the British, never mention incidents involving Americans? The reason for this is unknown. According to an official from the American Consulate General in Shanghai, the American authorities in this port are not aware of these incidents, indicating that the American community in Tianjin has naturally reported to the American authorities there.

### French Embassy Military Attaché Arrives in Shanghai for a Short Stay

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that Lieutenant Colonel Yefeng, the military attaché of the French Embassy in China, arrived in Shanghai from Beiping yesterday (the 6th) afternoon and plans to stay here for a month.

### Japan Plans to Develop the Zhoushan Fisheries; Establishes a "Fisheries Company"; Sends Ships to Transport Goods to Shanghai

The Zhoushan Islands, located east of Putuoshan in Hangzhou Bay, are isolated in the sea and are a fishing and salt-producing area. The annual fish production is about 20 million yuan. The fish supply for Shanghai mainly relies on the Zhoushan Islands. The Japanese have long coveted the islands. Since the occupation, the puppet "Central China Government" has been interfering and has organized a "Fisheries Company" to take control. The Japanese will also send fishery personnel from Japan to the Zhoushan Islands in September to plan fishery matters. In order to expand sales in Shanghai, six 80-ton transport ships have been specially prepared to transport fish from Zhoushan. Within 15 hours, they can load 56,250 kilograms of fish to Shanghai.

### Ningbo Defense Department Approves the Moufu Steamer to Sail Directly to Zhenhai; Passengers and Goods are Subject to Additional Handling Fees; Shanghai Merchants Allowed to Travel to Ningbo on Cargo Ships

Since the Ningbo Defense Command ordered the official closure of the Zhenhai port on the 28th of last month, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has been interrupted. The Zhongyi Depingen, Taikoo Xinjing, and other ships have all suspended sailing. However, in order to maintain transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo, the German Lihua Yanghang's Moufu Steamer is now anchoring outside the Zhenhai port, and passengers and goods are transferred by tugboat. The Moufu Steamer has decided to depart from Shanghai at 4:00 AM this morning and sail directly to the Zhenhai port, carrying 200 passengers and goods. It is expected to arrive outside the Zhenhai blockade line at around 3:00 PM today.

Hire Yong'an Steamer to Transfer Passengers and Goods

It has been decided that starting at 5:00 PM that evening, the Yong'an Steamer, previously hired to operate on the Ningbo inland waterway, will tow a barge from the gap at the blockade line to transfer passengers and goods out of port. At the Zhenhai wharf, they will be transferred to the Jingsheng Steamer, which has a deeper draft (previously operating between Ningbo and Zhenhai), and towed to Ningbo.

Deping Sailing to Ningbo Still Under Consideration

Goods and passengers transported from Ningbo to Shanghai will also use the same transfer method. Although loading and unloading is quite inconvenient, Shanghai-Ningbo navigation can be temporarily maintained continuously. The Deping Steamer is still under consideration. Once approved, it will also join the Shanghai-Ningbo run.

Additional Handling Fees for Passengers and Goods

Although Shanghai-Ningbo line steamers are allowed to continue sailing, the ships must anchor outside the port. All passenger and cargo handling must be done at night. During the day, they will sail to the waters off Qiliyu, and at night they will move to the foot of Huduishan. Therefore, coal consumption has increased, and handling costs also account for a significant expense. Therefore, in order to compensate for expenses, it has been decided to uniformly increase the handling fee for all passengers and goods. For fares, the original fare was 3 yuan for steerage, 5 yuan for cabins, and 7 yuan for official cabins, and now half a yuan will be added uniformly. The remaining freight charges will be increased by 30 percent according to the agreed method.

Merchants Allowed to Go to Ningbo to Collect Debts

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Military and Political Standing Committee to request permission for Shanghai merchants to go to Ningbo to collect debts and attach to cargo ships. Commander Liu of the 3rd Group Army has now replied by telegram: "Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce letter acknowledged. We have received a telegram from Commander Gu Hao, stating that Shanghai merchants are allowed to send personnel to Ningbo to collect debts, provided they have a certificate from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and are required to find a shop guarantor in Ningbo and clearly state the date of return to Shanghai. They are allowed to enter the port. Please instruct the patrol to handle the matter accordingly." It is reported that the Chamber has notified various trade associations to inform their respective members.

Zhejiang Eastern Mail Carried and Distributed by Moufu Steamer

The Shanghai Postal Administration had previously suspended navigation between Shanghai and Zhejiang due to the successive closures of the Ningbo and Wenzhou ports, which caused the complete interruption of Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping. Mr. Chen Weiping, the head of the Transportation Section of the Bureau, tried to find a way to deliver mail to various cities and counties in eastern Zhejiang and along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Except for the temporary suspension of the acceptance of large and small postal packages, light mail such as registered express mail, ordinary postcards, etc., will be forwarded from Jinjiang, which belongs to Fujian. Because the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line has been restored, it has been decided to forward light mail for eastern Zhejiang, such as Shaoxing, Yuyao Shangyu, and along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, such as Jinhua Zhuji Xiaoshan, etc., from Ningbo. It is reported that postal packages and heavy items are still temporarily suspended, and all light mail will be carried and distributed by Moufu this morning.

### White Russian Member of the Merchant Corps Commits Suicide by Shooting

A small squad of White Russian members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps is stationed in the Public Concession's Fuzhou Road Public Works Department. One of the members, a Russian named Di Michiquief, 22 years old, committed suicide with a handgun in the coppersmith's room of the Merchant Corps headquarters at 1:30 AM yesterday due to economic pressure. He fired two shots in a row, hitting his brain and chest, and died on the spot. After the discovery, the body was sent to the morgue for examination.

Gao Qipeng, from Hubei, 32 years old, has been working as a servant at the home of a certain Mr. Surname at No. 61 Anhe Temple Road. He and his legal wife, Zhou, lived together at No. 8 Giant Praris Road in the French Concession. A month ago, Zhou suffered abuse from her husband, which led to a quarrel, and Gao took the opportunity to stay outside. Zhou learned that her husband had another affair, but did not know the address. It was not until the morning before that she discovered that her husband was living with a prostitute, Zhou Sanyin from Hangzhou (22 years old), at No. 61 Anhe Temple Road. She went to catch them in the act of adultery, which led to a quarrel. Detective Xia Yeshan went and arrested Gao Qipeng and Zhou Sanyin and detained them in the police station separately. They were sent to the 8th Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning, and the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit according to Article 239 of the Criminal Code and stated the case. According to Zhou's complaint about catching them in the act of adultery, both defendants confessed to adultery, but claimed that Zhou had known about the matter for a long time and had lived together. The court ordered the defendants to be detained and rescheduled the hearing in seven days.

### German Woman Attempts Suicide

### Economic Pressure After the War; Cuts Open Scrotum to Commit Suicide; Pancake Shop Owner Dies Tragically

Zhang Desheng, from Rugao, 53 years old, previously ran a noodle shop on Ping'an Street, Xuejiabang, Nanshi. His father, Zhang Daoqun, is still alive at 75 years old and depends on Zhang for his livelihood. Zhang's wife, Wu, is 50 years old and has two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Rongquan, is 19 years old, and the younger son, Rongsheng, is only 7 years old. Previously, the whole family lived together. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident two years ago, Nanshi was occupied, and Zhang moved his family to No. 474 Labor Shenfu Road in the French Concession to open a pancake shop. On the 25th of last month, Zhang's father asked Zhang for money, but Zhang could not afford it, which led to a quarrel between father and son. Zhang felt deeply distressed by the economic hardship after the war. The next morning, after Zhang finished his early morning business, he went to the attic on the third floor to rest. He felt a combination of emotions and suddenly had suicidal thoughts. He used scissors to castrate himself, cutting open his scrotum to commit suicide. At 11:50 AM, his son went upstairs to call him for lunch and saw blood on his clothes. He told his mother, who discovered that he had castrated himself and used foreign liquor to strike his head. She immediately took him to Guangci Hospital for treatment in a carriage. After four periods, he finally died yesterday morning at 7:00 AM due to the severity of the injury. The hospital reported to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate and placed the body in the Tongren Fuyuan branch autopsy room, notifying the family to wait for the Special Second Court to send personnel to examine the body today.

### Aftermath of the Jiang Guopei Property Dispute; Accused of Repaying Escrow; Litigation Monger Sun Shaoqing Dies in Prison; His Wife Files Another Lawsuit After Being Released From Prison

Jiang Guopei, a descendant of a wealthy Nanjing family currently living at No. 43 Yongnian Lane, Baik Road, was involved in a lawsuit with his family, Jiang Yang, over a property dispute many years ago. At that time, Sun Shaoqing, a famous litigation monger, was directing Jiang Yang behind the scenes. Later, Jiang was repeatedly threatened by Sun, so when he reached a settlement with the other party, Sun's benefits were also quite substantial. Before long, Sun's blackmail and fraud were

Investigated and Reported by the Police Station

So Sun, his wife Zhu Ruizhu, and Sun's accomplice Jiang Zhaozhou were arrested one after another. At that time, Jiang, at the request of Sun's wife, did not want to aggravate Sun's crime and did not report the various blackmail and fraud that Sun had subjected him to. Now, Sun Shaoqing died in prison not long after being sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Jiang Zhaozhou was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, but the third instance verdict was sent back for retrial, and as a result, he was declared innocent and released. Sun's wife was sentenced to one year's imprisonment and has also been

Released from Prison After Serving Her Term

However, Sun Zhu Ruizhen has now produced two loan receipts from Jiang Guopei to Sun Shaoqing from the settlement agreement between Jiang Guopei and Jiang Yang. In the name of her children Sun Runsheng and Runying, who inherited her late husband's estate, and their legal guardian, she has hired a lawyer to sue Jiang for the repayment of an escrow of 6,480 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ni Weiheng opened the court to hear the case. After the plaintiff's attorney stated the purpose of the lawsuit, he submitted the loan receipts and requested a judgment ordering repayment. Jiang Guopei then stated

The Reason for Issuing the Receipt. He said that when he reached a settlement with Jiang Yang, Sun Shaoqing said that the amount given to Yang was not enough and asked to increase it by 4,080 yuan. Because he was afraid of his power, he wrote the receipt. A few days later, Sun asked to increase it by another 2,400 yuan and gave Sun a property deed as collateral for the 6,480 yuan. Later, when Sun's case was discovered and he was arrested, Sun's wife was afraid that he would report to the police station about her husband's blackmail in the past and returned the property deed, begging him not to pursue the past, but said that the two receipts he had written could not be found and would never

Create Further Problems

Moreover, after she was released from prison, she never mentioned it to him. Now, she is suing him based on these two receipts, but in fact, these two receipts were written under duress. Now, he will file a separate criminal self-accusation against the plaintiff for joint extortion and request that the case be suspended pending the outcome of the criminal suit, so that the truth will be revealed. Then, witnesses Zhao Zelin and lawyer Li Gengxiang arrived in court one after another to testify about the circumstances when they each signed the receipts as witnesses on that day, all stating that they did not witness any exchange of money between Sun and Jiang. Judge Ni then changed the date for the retrial because both parties still had the intention of reaching a settlement.

### Country Girl Tricked into Coming to Shanghai; Sold into a Brothel; Sang Wang Placed Under Arrest for Investigation

Wu Guidui (17 years old, married), a woman from Changshu, was tricked into coming to Shanghai on the 20th of last month by a female neighbor in the Suzhou countryside, who claimed she was leading her to Shanghai to work as a maid. She was sold to the brothel opened by Suzhou woman Sang Wang at No. 898 Edward Road for 150 yuan and forced to become a prostitute. Because Wu did not want to engage in this divine woman's life, she took the opportunity to escape a few days ago and reported to the Chengdu Road police station, requesting protection. Based on the report, the police station arrested Sang Wang. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the 2nd Criminal Court of the Special First Court and prosecuted for the crime of disrupting the family. It was also requested that the case be rescheduled pending the arrest of the Yang suspect. Judge Xiao took his seat and questioned her briefly, then ordered her to be detained and rescheduled the hearing. The victim, Wu Guidui, has been temporarily entrusted to the Jiliang Institute for care.

### The Tang Shuqian Fraud Case: Trial Summary, Four Suspects Released

Tang Shuqian, a local real estate businessman residing at a certain number on Xin Zha Road, received an anonymous threatening letter in March of this year, demanding hundreds of yuan. Tang ignored it, and the bandits made no further moves. However, between the 20th and 26th of last month, he suddenly received a letter bearing the name of the "Loyal Righteous National Salvation Corps," seeking a loan of 60,000 yuan. The letter included two bullets, eventually reducing the demand to 850 yuan, or else "drastic measures" would be taken. Tang had no choice but to report the matter to the Gordon Road Police Station. Detective Li, Wang Cheng Ying, and Xu Decheng successively arrested the suspects Zhuang Meichu, Zhang Guoying, Zhang Zhenqiu, Xu Shi, Cai Quansheng, as well as suspects Tang Xinchao, Shen Shixiong, Shen Sheng, and a woman named Wu Guie, and others. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the criminal division of the court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that after investigation, the suspects Tang Xinchao and the other three men and women were found to be innocent and requested their release, which the court approved. The victim, Tang Shuqian, was ill and being treated in the hospital and could not attend the court. He was represented by lawyer Yu Zhewen, who explained the circumstances under which Tang Shuqian received the threatening letter. Judge Jiang questioned each of the defendants and, after clarifying their statements, ordered them remanded in custody, with the verdict scheduled to be announced next Friday morning.

### A Package of Salt Found Contaminated with Arsenic, Several Poisoned After Consumption

Yesterday at 7:00 PM, Sun Wangshi, a 50-year-old resident of Changsha Road, Guling Road, originally from Jiangbei, bought a small package of salt found in a garbage bin from a scavenger, tempted by the cheap price. During dinner yesterday, she used it for seasoning. Unexpectedly, the salt was contaminated with arsenic. Sun Wangshi and others suffered severe poisoning after dinner. Besides Sun Wangshi, the victims included Sun Changhui, 17; Chen Guocai, 51; Zhao Xiaowuzi, 19; Chen Xiaosanzi, 37; Gu Laoju, 18; and Sun Shifu, 60, all from Jiangbei and working as road construction laborers for the electric company, regularly eating at Sun Wangshi's place. After the incident was discovered, they were rushed to the hospital for treatment. Medical examination revealed that all were severely poisoned, requiring urgent treatment. As of last night, they were still in critical condition.

### Accounting Staff in the Second Special District Prison Embezzles Food Supplies for Prisoners, Request Filed to Relevant Authorities for Investigation

Li Jian, an accounting staff member of the Second Special District Prison on Avenue Massenet, was in charge of purchasing food and other supplies for prisoners. In early April of this year, when purchasing red beans and wheat, the supplier delivered the goods to the prison. When Xie Qingbai and other inspectors checked the goods, they found sand, mud, and garbage mixed in. Considering the importance of public funds and prisoner rations, they immediately reported the matter to the warden, but no clear instructions were given for handling the situation. This month, Li Jian again purchased three packages each of broad beans and wheat from the Fuji Nanhua Store. During inspection and acceptance by Xie Qingbai, it was again found that the packages of broad beans and wheat were mixed with the same dirt and garbage, deliberately increasing the weight. It was suspected that the purchaser was colluding in fraudulent activity. As the responsibility of those inspecting and accepting the goods was crucial, Xie Qingbai immediately submitted a written report to Warden Sun Wei, requesting that the supervisory authorities of the prison, the Third Branch Court Procuratorate, investigate the matter to prevent corruption and maintain discipline.

### High Temperatures Persist in Shanghai, No Rain in Sight, Waterlogging in Western Shanghai Remains

The heat in Shanghai shows no signs of abating. Yesterday's weather remained extremely sultry. The temperature reached 93.9 degrees at noon and remained close to 90 degrees for a long time, often until 3 PM. According to the seasonal calendar, it is still the rainy season, or what meteorologists call the "plum rain" season. However, there is no sign of a heavy downpour, as the weather around Shanghai is now trending towards clear skies. Since the heavy rains before the 3rd of this month, waterlogging remains deep in areas such as Avenue Road, Hart Road, and Edinburgh Road in western Shanghai. The slow rate of drainage is unprecedented. The resulting foul odor is pervasive. If a similar heavy rain occurs during the autumn high tide, the damage will be significantly worse.

### Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Postpones Fundraising Broadcast, Rescheduled for the 13th of This Month

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's amateur troupe, which initiated a fundraising broadcast for the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, originally scheduled for today on the Xin Xin Radio Station, has been notified by the Municipal Council to postpone the event.

### In the Past Five Months, Guerrilla Warfare Achievements: About 400 Clashes with Japanese Troops, the Japanese Side's Plight is Evident in Their Words

The China Press reports that Major Yano of the Shanghai Japanese Army General Staff stated at a press conference yesterday (the 6th) that in the five months ending May 31st, Japanese troops fought guerrilla forces no less than 393 times within a 40-kilometer radius of the Shanghai Race Club. Nine Japanese soldiers were killed, and sixteen were wounded. There are 20,000 guerrillas in this area, but the Japanese military believes they do not constitute an effective force against the Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai. Guerrilla leaders obtain funds and enter the French Concession and the International Settlement to

Purchase Arms

and ammunition, especially ammunition. The Japanese military has accurate records of these transactions. At this point, a reporter interrupted and asked why, if the Japanese knew that foreigners were engaged in arms sales, they did not suggest taking action to suppress it. The spokesperson replied that, in his opinion, third-country nationals were not really engaged in smuggling arms; only some of them arranged such transactions. Other than Chinese people, he did not want to mention the

Names and Nationalities

of those involved in this work. Another asked, since the Japanese controlled the borders and customs officials routinely inspect ships, how could arms be smuggled to the guerrillas? The spokesperson replied that most of the arms came from various ports along the Yangtze River and were then smuggled out in small boats. Customs inspections are not "so thorough." When asked about the amount of arms being smuggled in and out of the settlements, the spokesperson could not answer. A Russian reporter asked if it was true that when Chinese troops retreated from Nanjing and other places, they buried

Large Quantities of Ammunition

which the guerrillas then used. The spokesperson replied that most of what was dug up was. When asked if it was untrue that more of the guerrillas' arms came from the Chinese interior than from the settlements, the spokesperson said, "No." The spokesperson added that Japanese policy was to station a small number of troops in various parts of the area to constantly clash with the guerrillas. Japanese troops used Chinese ships to search for irregular Chinese troops. When found, the Japanese troops would remove their long clothes and

Put on Military Uniforms

to launch a surprise attack, which was a major factor in dealing with the guerrillas. Unless the Japanese army could cross the guerrilla outposts about eight kilometers away from the guerrilla headquarters, further advances would be futile, as the enemy would simply retreat.

### The Case of the Lascivious Monk Wan Yuan Who Had Illicit Relationship and Stole The Concubine

Yang Yunwu from Gaoyou, who had served as a magistrate in various provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong, brought his beloved concubine, Sun Lanzhen, to Shanghai for safety after the "August 13th" incident. They resided in the Sanjiao Leshan Temple on Rue Joffre, Pére Robert Road. Unexpectedly, in the autumn of last year, Sun had an affair with Wan Yuan, the abbot of the temple (secular name Tong Changliang). Later, a lawsuit occurred in the temple, and the temple's property was auctioned off by the court. Yang then moved with Sun to No. 3, Lane 44, Rue Foch, while Wan Yuan moved to the Baiyun Nunnery on Rue Amiral Bayle. However, their illicit relationship was difficult to sever, and they often secretly met in hotels. Unexpectedly, on May 28th of this year, Wan Yuan, the monk, incited Sun to take 2,000 yuan in cash, 16 taels of gold jewelry, and furs, valued at about 6,000 yuan, and flee. Yang had no choice but to report the matter to the French police, who sent detectives Jiang Changwen and others, along with personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Police, to arrest Wan Yuan at the Bodhi Charity Association on Pehtang Road. Based on the confession, they also went to his residence and found three pairs of embroidered pillowcases and four pairs of modern women's shoes, which were all items stolen by Yang's concubine Sun. The police then escorted Wan Yuan and the evidence to the Second Special District Court, requesting a postponement of the hearing. The details have already been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiu presided over the criminal division of the court and reviewed the case. The police stated that the investigation procedures were not yet completed and requested an extension of the detention. The court approved the request and announced that the case would be heard again on the 13th of this month.

### Dynamics of Christian Universities in Various Places: Part of St. John's University Students Move Back to Fanwangdu, Soochow University Promotes Agricultural and Forestry Work in Shaowu

Shanghai

President Li of the Soochow University of Literature and Science is on sabbatical leave this year to study at Columbia University in the United States. Originally planned for one year, President Li recently wrote from New York stating that he would conclude his research work in the month, leave the United States, and return to China via Europe. He plans to arrive in Shanghai in late August. The university implements a tutor system with seven measures that can be used for reference: (1) allocation and organization, (2) selection and employment of tutors, (3) tutor meetings, (4) case studies, (5) individual interviews, (6) group guidance, (7) interview records. Since the death of President Liu Zhanen of Shanghai University, the university has been headed by Vice President Fan Zhengkang. The university's board of directors has now appointed Fan Zhengkang as the official president.

Since August 13, St. John's University has relocated entirely to the fourth floor of the Continental Emporium for classes. This summer vacation, some students moved back to the campus at Fanwangdu for classes, while the rest remained at the Cishu Building for classes.

Soochow University is still holding classes at Moore Hall and the Cishu Building. The university implements a tutor system, formulating various regulations and student activity measures, which have been effective.

Hong Kong

Since President Li took office at Sun Yat-sen University, he has made many contributions. Recently, Oberlin College in the United States awarded him an honorary degree, and the award ceremony was held on June 13th of this year. The university also received a grant of US$750 from the American Foundation to renew subscriptions to biology, chemistry, and physics magazines. In addition, students traveling to Annam are preparing to establish an Annam Lingnan branch school, with Situ Wei going to preside over it. There are currently 47 students. Two students from the university, Liu Shaochi (citrus processing) and Huo Baoqiang (fruit marketing), received the Zheng Yuquan Memorial Fruit Tree Horticulture Scholarship for studying in the United States. They first went to Chaoshan for two months of research and left Hong Kong for the United States in mid-May. Furthermore, Huang Shengguang, Zhang Xingqing, Li Pengfei, and Liang Bingsheng were selected as scientific research assistants under the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund and assigned to work at the university.

Shaowu

Since the University of Shaowu relocated to Shaowu, students are far away from their homes and have fewer visits from relatives and friends, as well as fewer social activities. Their energy and time can be focused on their studies and public service, with significant achievements. The public performances of the drama troupe and the promotion and leadership of choral singing are quite popular. Night schools have also been opened to subsidize the education of the public and out-of-school children. Publications such as the University Weekly, Fujian Culture, University Arts and Literature, University Agricultural Report, and Semi-Annual Mathematical Physics are published to enhance local culture, modern national spirit and morality, promote practical science, and promote national consciousness among the people in the interior. Near the school, there are more than 300 acres of land where rice experiments and breeding improvements are actively carried out to increase rice production, with the hope of new varieties appearing in five or six years. Forest work is being expanded, and tens of thousands of seedlings have been planted to afforest barren mountains. At the same time, horticulture, breeding, and improved feeding of poultry and livestock are being promoted. This semester, the number of students has increased sharply, and the library and classrooms of each department are not enough. Construction of a new library and additional classrooms has begun to provide better resources for students. The faculty and staff are enthusiastic about national salvation work and have recently held a national savings campaign.

Nanping

The Hua Nan Women's College of Arts and Sciences is still holding classes at Jianjin High School. Six to seven thousand books have been continuously shipped to the school for the reference of faculty and students. Many scientific instruments and other school supplies have also been shipped, but the school building is narrow and insufficient for use. President Wang Shijing went to Shunchang to look for another school site, but it was inconvenient, so the plan was abandoned. It was also proposed to build temporary school buildings, but after the project was estimated, it would cost about 10,000 yuan. Due to the outbreak of meningitis in the area, the construction plan was delayed. The college has a comprehensive plan for women's training in Nanping, but it has not been possible to hold it due to the epidemic.

### Finance: August Foreign Exchange: Jardine Matheson Still Trading, Major Banks Had No Transactions Yesterday

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's listed prices remained unchanged. In the informal market for British and American exchange, Jardine Matheson was very active, and foreign firms were also settling accounts. Fortunately, foreign banks were willing to supply steadily. However, the American exchange seemed weaker, resulting in a slight softening of the British exchange and a slight rebound of the American exchange. The July futures also showed little change, and the situation stabilized again. Although the British bank Jardine Matheson and a certain broker on behalf of the Tianjin gang and certain brokers on behalf of Japanese banks and Chinese merchants competed to absorb, various Chinese and foreign banks were still keen to sell. Therefore, the supply and demand were balanced, and in the end, no one was superior. However, the August futures suddenly saw trading yesterday, but a few foreign banks with related responsibilities still had no transactions. It is heard that the British bank Jardine Matheson and the Belgian bank held the British gold price at 6 pence and 1875, which is 25 away from July (American exchange was bid at 12 yuan and 125). Trading was still active throughout the day. As for the Hong Kong exchange, it initially weakened, but rebounded later and ended up with no gain or loss.

Supply and Demand Considered Balanced

In the morning, due to the large London terms, the near-term sharply contracted by 5625, and the long-term plummeted by half a penny. The New York silver price also fell by 1.25 points. The London raw gold was down by half a penny. The exchange rates of British vs. American, vs. Shanghai, and vs. French were all flat. American vs. British, vs. Shanghai, and vs. French also showed no change. The central listed prices for various exchanges remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 6 pence and 5625 for British gold and 12 yuan and 78125 for American exchange, a slight softening of 03125 for the British exchange and a slight rebound for the American exchange compared to the previous close. After opening, although Jardine Matheson and foreign firms came to compete to absorb, the supply from the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank and other banks was still strong, so there was no change. It is estimated that Jardine Matheson and foreign firms successively settled with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank and Mackellar British gold at 6 pence and 5625, and at the same time settled with American banks and Japanese foreign firms for spot American exchange at 12 yuan and 78125. When the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's listed prices were announced, they remained unchanged. And the silver equalization tax was announced to be still exempt. After that, Japanese banks and Chinese merchants also came to purchase July British and American exchange, but foreign banks were quite willing to supply, and Chinese banks continued to settle, so the market was still extremely stable. It is estimated that Japanese banks and Chinese merchants absorbed July British gold at 6 pence and 4375 from foreign banks and Chinese banks, and also July American exchange at 12 yuan and 5625. At that time, the foreign bank Jardine Matheson and the Chinese bank traded August British gold at 6 pence and 1875, and there were buyers for August American exchange at 12 yuan and 125. Near noon, the Hong Kong exchange market was still soft. It is heard that the bank's selling price had hardened to 44 yuan and a half. Extended to the midday close, the bank's spot selling prices for British and American exchange were the same as the morning opening.

The Result is British Flat, American Tight

Afternoon trading suddenly thinned. There was no trading heard for spot British and American exchange. As for July futures, the Dutch once sold to Jardine Matheson on behalf of the Tianjin gang at a price of 6 pence and 4375. After that, the Hong Kong exchange returned to flat because the foreign banks' selling intentions weakened. The spot price was 44 yuan and 375. Extended to the evening close, the bank's spot selling prices for British gold were 6 pence and 5625, and American exchange was 12 yuan and 78125, still not much different from the morning opening. The selling prices for July were 6 pence and 4375 for British gold and 12 yuan and 5625 for American exchange. As a result, compared with the previous day, the spot British exchange was flat and the American exchange rebounded slightly by 03125. The futures in July showed no gain or loss. The Hong Kong exchange also showed no change at the final price. The day's trading record is recorded below: (British Exchange)

### Northern Merchants Dumping: Cash Wants to Rise and Falls Again, Morning Opening High is a Flash in the Pan, Trading is Very Light, Only 400 Taels Strong

Yesterday's informal market situation for raw silver cash was initially very firm, with a tendency to rise steadily. Then it gradually declined, and as a result, it continued to rise by 1 yuan and 50 cents. Initially, a certain money exchange business was entrusted by a department store customer to search and purchase on its behalf. In addition, many sellers were watching, so a boatload of speculators took the opportunity to raise prices wildly. The morning opening rose to 2,595 yuan. Later, a certain jewelry store, on behalf of a wealthy businessman, forcefully sold high, and the securities gang also came out with more selling than buying. Although the Hong Kong gang came to absorb slightly at that time, the supply ultimately exceeded the demand, and it gradually retreated to 2,576 yuan. After that, the underlying trend turned flat, with no major changes. The closing price in the evening was 2,577 yuan and 50 cents. Trading was dull, only about 400 taels in the morning and only 20 taels in the afternoon. The price of jewelry gold first rose and then fell, and finally remained unchanged. The customs gold remained flat, and the Chinese and British pure gold, etc., fell slightly.

Raw Silver Still Up One Yuan and a Half

Since the initial morning opening of each bar (ten taels), a certain money exchange business was entrusted by a department store customer to purchase on its behalf. In addition, the underlying trend at the close of the previous day was quite firm, so the retail supply was very light, resulting in the price being shrouded in a buying trend. It was raised sharply by 19 yuan. At 9:30 AM, a certain money exchange business entered 50 taels of cash, priced at 2,595 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange business had no more appetite, and the rising trend was too sharp, which inevitably caused many households to take profits and sell high, so the decline was also strong. It fell by 5 yuan in an instant. A certain jewelry store, on behalf of a wealthy businessman, sold 50 taels to the securities gang, priced at 90 yuan. Although the Hong Kong gang came to absorb slightly at that time, the northern merchants had stopped buying and turned to selling, and the market trend finally turned downward. The securities gang sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange business again, priced at 88 yuan. Soon, a certain jewelry store sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange business again on behalf of a wealthy businessman, priced at 85 yuan. Then it fell another 5 yuan. The securities gang sold 50 taels to a certain jewelry store, priced at 80 yuan. Then, the gold shops traded 10 taels with each other, priced at 78 yuan. Not long after, a certain gold shop sold 20 taels to a certain jewelry store, priced at 76 yuan. Then, a certain jewelry store entered 50 taels with a certain money exchange business, priced at 78 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange business entered 50 taels of cash with a certain cash shop, priced at 79 yuan. Near noon, the jewelry gang entered 20 taels with the money exchange business, and 77 yuan was the midday closing price. In the afternoon, trading suddenly became light, and the trend was extremely flat. Only the money exchange business was seen selling 20 taels to the gold shop, priced at 2,577 yuan and 50 cents, as the evening closing price. As a result, it was up 1 yuan and 50 cents compared to the rolling closing price of the previous day, with a 19-yuan rise and fall throughout the day. The selling price of the cash shop's own-brand gold was 2,585 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,570 yuan. The current premium is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there is little trading.

Jewelry Gold First Rises Sharply, Then Falls Slightly

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael initially remained unchanged. When it reached 9:50 AM, it was also raised by 2 yuan due to the firm opening of raw silver cash. Later, around 10:30 AM, it immediately fell back by 2 yuan due to the setback of raw silver cash. As a result, there was no change. It is estimated that Da Tonghang is still quoting the original price of 261 yuan, and Xin Tonghang is 259 yuan, with the purchase price at 253 yuan.

British Pure Gold Contracts by Half a Penny

A London telegram on the 6th reported that British pure gold suddenly contracted by half a penny, estimated at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence per ounce, causing the Chinese cash buying price of the Central Bank to also be quoted down to 1,212 yuan and 30 cents. The listed customs gold remained unchanged, estimated at 2 yuan, 3 corners, 9 minutes, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard premium price also decreased by 3 corners, estimated at 1,207 yuan and 6 corners.

British and American Banknotes See Mixed Ups and Downs

Yesterday, British pure gold fell by a small amount. The British and American exchange rates did not change. In local foreign exchange counters, foreign firms were still eager to settle accounts, and the demand for American exchange increased relatively. Foreign banks supplied smoothly, and the market situation was British flat and American tight. The British exchange was still 6 pence and 5625, and the American exchange was 12 yuan and 78125, rebounding slightly by 03125 compared to Bu Ri. The opening demand for raw silver cash was very strong, and the supply was scarce, trading to a high of 2,595 yuan. Afterwards, gold shops, money exchange businesses, etc. took advantage of the high price to sell, and the market price gradually declined. The midday closing was 77 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was 77 yuan and a half. The market was stable, and trading was as sparse as the morning stars, and it closed quickly. The market price did not change. As a result, it was up 1 yuan and 50 cents compared to the previous day. Foreign currency British and American gold pounds, trading was sluggish. British gold pounds decreased slightly. British and American gold notes, the supply and demand trended thinly. Due to the stable exchange market, the market price of British gold notes continued to rise, and American gold notes decreased slightly. Hong Kong notes and Annam notes were in strong demand, and the market price continued to rise. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes were equal, and remained at 9 corners, 9 minutes, and 3 li. The demand for Korean notes was sluggish, and the market was weak, at 8 corners, 6 minutes, and 8 li. Trading at the association was sparse. Hengmao sold and Fuhuaixiang bought 200 yuan of American gold notes. In addition, Xiangfeng sold and Hengmao bought 500 yuan of American gold notes. Huikang sold and Yongtai bought 50 pounds of British gold notes. Yesterday's market prices were as follows: British gold pounds down 1 corner, British gold notes up 5 points, American gold notes down 5 li, Hong Kong notes up 3 li, Annam notes up 1 point, and all other currencies remained unchanged.

### Why the Banking Sector is Unwilling to Issue Small Denomination Currency

Two Arguments

The lack of copper coins has reached a point where, in today's market, stamps are the only "currency" available for small change.

Of course, there are timing issues as to why the banking sector has not issued small denomination currency to meet the needs of the citizens. However, "no one does business at a loss," especially not the extremely calculating financial world, which would certainly consider costs and profits.

When the exchange rate was around 1 shilling and 6 pence, the cost of a paper note was about 12 cents for a one-yuan note and 14.5 cents for a five-yuan note. I remember fifteen years ago, when Guangdong silver coins gradually flooded the market and the exchange rate of small foreign coins fell daily, causing great inconvenience in transactions, the Shangbao newspaper advocated the issuance of subsidiary currency notes for silver dollars. However, some people speaking on behalf of the banking sector strongly opposed it, mainly because the cost of printing 10-cent and 20-cent notes seemed too high compared to the printing cost of one-yuan and five-yuan notes in the eyes of the banking sector at the time. They felt that the procedures for small denomination notes were too cumbersome, the cost too high, and the profit too small. However, a few years later, small denomination notes were finally issued, and now the world is dominated by them.

Compared to yuan notes, the cost of small denomination notes is indeed higher. However, the printing cost of small denomination notes is definitely not equal to that of yuan notes, let alone exceeding one dime. Using a few cents' worth of printing for 10-cent or 20-cent notes would certainly not result in a loss, just a lower profit margin.

The situation is different now. Since it is small denomination notes that are being printed, of course, the American Bank Note Company or the British Bradbury, Wilkinson & Co. would not be commissioned. Instead, Chinese printing houses would undertake the job—for example, the Central Bank's 10-cent and 20-cent notes are printed by the Zhonghua Book Company. However, the paper for the banknotes and the printing pigments (if they are to be of good quality) must be "foreign goods." With an exchange rate between 6 pence and 7 pence, which is only about one-third of the 1 shilling and 6 pence rate, the cost of printing a one-yuan note today would probably not be less than 20 or 30 cents. Even though the printing of small denomination notes is not as exquisite as that of one-yuan notes, given the high cost of goods today, it is uncertain whether the face value of a one-cent note can cover its printing cost, even if it is printed in monochrome. Even with five-cent notes to offset the cost with one-cent notes, the banking sector would still hesitate to act without a "guaranteed profit."

Secondly, everyone knows that small denomination currency has high liquidity, is frequently exchanged, and is easily damaged. Therefore, most subsidiary currencies are made of metal because they are durable and not easily damaged. Paper currency does not have this advantage. If the paper is of poor quality, it will become soiled and torn in no time, and the issuing bank cannot refuse to exchange them for new notes. Wouldn't that cause significant losses for the issuer? Moreover, the smaller the denomination, the more cumbersome the issuance procedures. This handling fee is also considerable. Therefore, even banks that have printed small denomination currency notes are unwilling to release them to alleviate the market's urgency, precisely because of this.

Therefore, under the centralized note issuance system, only the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have an inescapable responsibility to step forward and undertake this arduous task to provide convenience to the public. The Ministry of Finance has already instructed the Central Bank to prepare for the issuance. We hope it will be as quick as possible, and that the issuance will be widespread and easy to implement, so that people don't have to stand in long lines and still not be able to exchange their money!

### Cash is King: Clearing Checks Requires a Fee

Cleared checks and cash were originally of equal value. In May, because foreign banks refused to accept cash and required checks to avoid the trouble of counting cash, cleared checks commanded a premium, reaching as high as two yuan per thousand yuan. That is, 1002 yuan in cash could be exchanged for 1000 yuan in cleared checks. Subsequently, the premium gradually decreased to parity. Since the Ministry of Finance announced the restrictions on deposits and withdrawals on the 22nd of last month, it caused misunderstandings among depositors and led to a run on deposits. Everyone hoarded cash, and the demand for cash suddenly increased. Recently, due to the supply and demand relationship in the market, exchanging cleared checks for cash requires a fee of 50 cents to one yuan per thousand yuan. For example, with a fee of one yuan, clearing 1000 yuan in checks only yields 999 yuan in cash.

### Silver Prices Plummet

London, 6th: Silver speculators sold, lacking support. Trading closed quietly. India and speculators bought at listed prices. Some short positions were covered for profit. Sellers showed less inclination to sell. Spot silver fell sharply by 5.625 pence, and forward silver plunged by half a penny. New York silver report: US spot silver fell another 1.25 cents. Bombay silver report: Indian silver was unstable. Spot and July contracts fell another 9 annas. August also fell slightly by 5 annas. Trading volume reached 125 contracts.

### Discount Rates Also Fall Slightly

Yesterday, the discount rate for cleared checks continued to fall. It started at 93 or 94 yuan per thousand yuan and soon dropped to around 90 yuan by noon. In the afternoon, it rebounded slightly to 91 yuan, 1.5 yuan lower than the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Dealers' Association remained unchanged, quoted at 20 cents in both the morning and afternoon.

### Securities: Stock Market Flat and Weak

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Exchange showed signs of improved sentiment. There were buyers for various stocks, but bid prices remained low. There were no sellers. Jardine Matheson shares showed some progress, closing at 18.7 yuan. Tramway shares were still active, priced around 40 yuan. The 5.5% Electricity Bonds had good demand, priced between 81 yuan and 81.5 yuan.

London Far East company shares, June 6th (Wednesday) listed prices: only the Mercantile Bank shares rose 2 shillings and 6 pence. The rest remained flat.

London Chinese foreign debt, June 6th (Wednesday) listed prices: mostly unchanged. However, the Sino-French American dollar 5% bond with stamped debt notes fell another £1, priced at £44. The previous day, £2,000 of German Reorganization Loan were traded, opened at £27 5s, £6 5s below the London listed price. Trading prices: the buying price for the British Reorganization Loan was £32 5s, and the selling price was £33 15s. An English physical goods seller offered £2,000 of Daokou-Qinghua Railway bonds, priced at £13, £1 above market price. Another £2,000 of British Reorganization Loan was offered, priced at £33 5s, £0 5s below market price.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Sales Obstructed Everywhere. Dye Factories Suspending Operations is Heard Daily. Eastern Piece Goods' Outlet Reduced Sharply.

Domestic Cloth

Market trends are soft, mainly because sales are obstructed everywhere, especially white cloth sales, which are particularly weak. Selling prices are unsustainable and continue to fall. Yesterday, prices fell another 5 to 10 cents per piece. Light-colored goods are being sold off urgently due to short sales periods, causing extreme market confusion with price differences of 30 cents to over one yuan per piece. Colored cloth, flannel, and serge are still firm. Sales in the Guangdong Mazhang area are the most active, with transactions including colored cloth and twill from factories such as Huafeng and Daxin, and flannel and serge from factories such as Hongzhang and Qingfeng, totaling over 100 cases. Purchasers bought 40 to 50 bales of fine twill of various brands such as "Running Dog," "Fortune," and "Ingot." Buyers from Sichuan and Yunnan purchased over 3,000 bolts of flannel and serge from factories such as Huayang, Qingfeng, and Hongzhang. Buyers from Xinghua, Jiangsu Province purchased over 500 bolts of patterned cloth. Wholesale shops in this street sold yarn, hemp yarn, and patterned goods, with many scattered small orders, but there was little intention to pre-order autumn and winter goods. Buyers from Singapore and Luoyang in foreign countries showed increased interest, with transactions including colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and patterned cloth from Lun Chang totaling over 2,800 bolts.

Eastern Piece Goods

The white cloth market continued to weaken. "Dragon Head" fine cloth fell to 13.8 yuan per piece. This month's futures contracts are at 14.05 yuan. Yesterday, the market was virtually at a standstill. Transactions among traders were also rare, because actual sales were scarce. Dye factories in this street are suspending operations, which is heard daily. The outlet for grey cloth has been sharply reduced. In addition, the discount is too high, and speculators' interest has gradually waned. Therefore, fine cloth and fine twill, which are usually in high demand, have become oversupplied and entered a weak market.

Exports

Piece goods exports on the 8th: 150 cases to Haiphong, 25 cases to Beihai, 4 cases to Guangzhou Bay, 27 cases to Hong Kong, 360 cases to Tianjin, 120 cases to Yantai.

### Silk and Tea: The Future of Dried Cocoons is Full of Thorns. Silk Merchants Prudently Sell.

Yesterday's silk market: New York spot prices were unchanged, near-term contracts rose by half a cent, and far-term contracts rose slightly by half a cent. Lyon was also unchanged. Yokohama spot prices were sold at the original price, and far-term contracts fell by 5 yuan. Looking at the overseas market situation, both Japan and the United States were uneventful. In the local silk market, white silk factories had some occasional transactions, and prices were firm. Qili silk was priced at 1200 yuan through six dealers, remaining stable. The offerings were all new goods. Silk merchants did not dare to sell futures of either white silk factory silk or Qili silk rashly, because the future of silk is still full of thorns. Shanghai silk merchants have already deeply realized the difficulties in this business.

### Green Tea Sales to Europe Still Strong

Yesterday's tea market: Yingzhuang, Xiehe, Jinlong, and other firms showed renewed interest in core teas and standard teas. In addition, the quantity of new goods arriving at the factories in recent days has been small, and few new samples have been displayed. The market remains stable. The total transaction volume of green tea in the city was over 500 cases, mostly Zhongguan goods. Core tea was sold at 315 to 336 yuan, and standard tea was sold at 254 to 275 yuan. The market remains stable. The re-export of raw white sugar trade is recovering.

### Sugar Market: Re-export of Raw White Sugar Trade is Recovering

Yesterday's sugar market: According to the London report, prices only fluctuated by 2.5. August was 8 shillings and 1.5 pence, December was 6 shillings and 3 pence, and February of next year was 6 shillings and 4 pence. The local Sugar Association's clearing price for raw white sugar was largely unchanged. The price at the local warehouse was 29.7 yuan, and the price at the foreign warehouse was 50 cents higher. The re-export price was 21.15 yuan for 1300 bags, and later slightly tighter at 21.3 yuan for 500 bags. Taikoo sugar prices rose. The western warehouse price for B mark was 30.3 to 30.4 yuan, and the eastern warehouse price was 10 cents higher. The western warehouse price for CW mark was 30.1 yuan, the CX mark was 29.8 yuan, the DY mark was 29.3 yuan, and the HX mark was 29.1 yuan. The H mark for granulated red sugar was 21 yuan, and the spot price for Dutch red sugar was 22 yuan. The rest were largely unchanged. For domestic sugar, Chaozhou merchants offered dozens of bags of premium white sugar, and the price rose to 21.7 to 21.2 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Foreign Firms Urgently Demand Payment. Cotton Merchants Still Find It Difficult to Cope. A Stagnant Market is Likely to Form.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market opened strong due to positive news from Liverpool. Southern spot prices were also strong. Traders and overseas cotton merchants bought in the market, and short positions were also covered. As a result, market prices rose by 3 to 4 points. Later, the government's weekly cotton area weather report was released, which showed that this week's weather was very good. Rainfall in various areas was quite favorable, and the activity of bollworms was also reduced, which led some long positions to take profits. As a result, the New York closing price rose by 3 points and fell by 2 points. Indian cotton forecast to fall by more than one rupee. Egyptian cotton fell by 15 points.

The transaction of Shanghai foreign cotton is gradually quiet, and it is likely to form a dead market. If cotton can be used as collateral to loosen the financial situation, then it may be possible to recover. Many goods have arrived recently, and foreign firms are urging payment. All parties are finding it difficult to cope, and many people are making excuses that the samples do not match to delay payment.

Domestic Cotton

The transaction of domestic cotton has slightly developed, and the thinking of the peers is still dull, but there are slightly offset the position transactions, and the transaction amount is still very small. As for the factory and its peers, although they have the intention to act, it is helpless that the existing cash is strangely dry and difficult to find. As a result, the market presents a state of stagnation. All mutual transactions are based on the remittance price. Xinyu Factory entered 800 pieces of Bairuo, spot warehouse delivery, and the source of northern Jiangsu is slightly smoother. The goods arrived at the wharf, including 657 packages of Tongzhou cotton, 86 packages from Beisha, and it is said that two ships of Huoji cotton arrived in Shanghai from Xiahe, each ship about 3-500 ancestors, totaling 1,000 loads. The current cotton situation is recorded as follows:

Bairuo District (No. 21) 101.00

Hede flower wood frame 104.00

Xiashe flower white bag 83.00

Xinyu Factory entered 800 pieces, remittance warehouse delivery

The peers entered 240 packages, again, again

Another 100 packages, again, again

Large quantities of Indian cotton are being transported to Japan and China. Yesterday morning, the Fortunstella arrived from Karachi, India, with 14,147 pieces of cotton, which docked at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading. It is heard that the ship still has 14,905 pieces of Indian cotton to be delivered to Japan. After the Shanghai cotton is unloaded, it will depart for various parts of Japan around the 11th. Another British ship, the Kauf, arrived in Shanghai from London. It loaded 350 pieces of cotton in Mumbai and entered port this evening. Docked at the No. 11 and 12 pontoons for transshipment. Another freighter of the British Company, the Tailman, arrived from Calcutta, India, with 5,942 pieces of cotton, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Scheduled to dock at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading.

### Large Quantities of Cotton Yarn Exported Today

The cotton yarn spot market is closed. In this weak market, the dark market trading, the news is even more dull. After inquiring everywhere, there is no market to do. From the current environment, the money is not loose, and the market price is still difficult to rise. Today's exports total more than 3,000 pieces, including 980 pieces to Tianjin, 300 pieces to Yantai, 590 pieces to Hong Kong, 40 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 560 pieces to Beihai, and 600 pieces to Haiphong.

### Grains: Hand Goods for Sale. Rice Prices Fall.

Dumi: Yesterday, the sources from various gangs, the Hexia goods were blocked and not released in Minhang by a certain party, and have not arrived yet. Che Lun Baozi continued to come to Fengjing 1,200-1,300 packages. On the sales market side, since the previous dynasty turned lax, yesterday it was even more so because of the strange heat of the weather and the emptiness of people's hearts. Sellers were all thinking of selling quickly, but the shops in this street were all watching, and the inland gangs were not moving. The shouting price dropped, and the market price fell. As a result, the price of thick and thin japonica rice fell by 20-30 cents, but there were still very few transactions. The total market volume was 4,000+ shih. The downward trend of bianyuan has weakened, and the fall has continued to be fierce, with another 30+ cents lost. Hong Kong glutinous rice high tuans only opened at 19.78 yuan.

Kexian: Yesterday, the arrival and sales were both scarce, but the demand in the inland has decreased, and new transactions are less than a thousand packages. A few customers returned. The high-end goods were cut by 1-2 cents, and the medium-to-low-end goods were a little 2-3 cents. High-end goods are still slightly handled in this street, and the medium-to-low-end machine rice and brown rice are all mainly dependent on the inland. As soon as the inland stalls, the market will tend down.

Yangmi: Orders are still being made, and those who ordered early may arrive in port after a few days, so people are very weak. However, the existing inventory is not abundant, and nearly a hundred packages were opened yesterday, still at 23 yuan.

### North and South Goods: The Yield of Yuanhong Branches has Decreased Significantly.

Xinghua News: The new Yuanhong branches in this district could have had a bumper harvest, but they were destroyed by wind and rain, and the discount was greatly reduced, only about 30-40%. Therefore, the production price has suddenly risen, and has reached more than 20 yuan before and after. It is heard that the harvest of Lanzhu branches in Zhangzhou this year is about 50%, and the first city is expected to be well sold.

### Medicinal Materials: The Recent Market for Bitter Almonds has Turned Strong.

Bitter almonds had a very large source in the previous market, so the bottom accumulation was abundant. The lowest price was once dropped to 42 yuan. Now the inventory between the lines is gradually being sold out, and the trend has turned firm. The current market higher price is over 50 yuan cash, and it is heard that this year's new goods harvest is not abundant, and the delineation is about 41-42 yuan, and people's hearts are very fixed.

### Gardenia Seed is Required by the Northern Gang.

Gardenia seed is urgently needed by the Northern Gang recently. Several pieces were packed and shipped at a price of 26 yuan the other day, but there is no large supply in the production area of this product, resulting in a lack of inventory here. It has risen by 4 yuan compared to the previous market. If there are no arrivals in the future, it is still expected to continue to rise.

### Coal: Henan Coal is in High Demand.

Although Henan white coal is difficult to transport and new goods cannot be delivered due to traffic difficulties, there are still 2-3,000 tons of old inventory on the market, which is sold by an agent of a certain foreign company. Sunlai also followed up with high-end goods and continued to rise. And because the peers need a strong demand for door and zhuang, they have to prevent the price from sucking in. More than 200 tons were transacted yesterday, and the price of Henan Tongmei was 45 yuan per ton and 50 yuan per ton for lump coal, which was 6 yuan higher than the previous month. Retail prices for menzhuang and Lingjiao lump per ton were 56 yuan, each 7 yuan.

### Import and Export

Today, there are 235 bags of soybeans, 59 pieces of egg yolk white, 450 pieces of raw oil, 19 pieces of tea oil, and 400 bags of flour, all transported to Hong Kong. Another 2,000 bags of flour were transported to Weihaiwei, and another 10 bags of silk warp were transported to Haiphong.

### Statistics: Shanghai Workers' Living Expenses Index, June 28th (Continued)

This month, the prices of goods have shown a rapid rise due to the direct or indirect impact of foreign exchange contraction. The newspaper articles are full of price increase announcements, which shows the severity of the price increase. In particular, the price of rice has risen the most sharply, with the highest price of japonica rice reaching 22.4 yuan per shih, which has not been seen in Shanghai for 75 years since the Tongzhi and Guangxu eras. The reasons are nothing more than the following: (1) Foreign exchange contraction makes it difficult to import foreign rice; (2) The occupied areas impose heavy taxes and levies, increasing costs; (3) The production areas prohibit exports, raising the price of rice; (4) In the Tianjin lock-up, residents hoard a large amount; (5) Speculation is manipulated. Due to the above reasons, the price of rice has risen sharply and cannot be contained. The authorities of the public concession and the French concession discussed with the representatives of the rice industry and stipulated that from June 23, the market price of the highest grade white japonica rice, whether wholesale or retail, should not exceed 21 yuan per shih, and the highest grade kexian rice should not exceed 17 yuan per shih. The middle grade is reduced accordingly. The soaring price of rice has come to an end, but the consumption of rice accounts for 2.31% of the total consumption of Shanghai workers' families. The soaring price of rice has a profound impact on the lives of workers, and the hardship is self-evident. Among the fuels, the price of coal balls has also risen sharply. Within ten days, the Coal Ball Industry Association announced price increases for three consecutive times, starting from 1.6 yuan per load, rising to 1.8 yuan, then increasing to 1.9 yuan, and reaching 2.1 yuan at the end of the month. The index of this month, the previous month, the same month last year, and the base year (1936) are recorded below for comparison.

### Procedures for Studying in the United States

— Star

Every semester after graduation, many students from various schools plan to go to universities in the United States for further studies. The season has now arrived, and they will definitely feel unfamiliar with the preparations before going abroad, the itinerary, the entry procedures, and everything after arriving in the United States. Therefore, the above points will be published in this journal in succession for the reference of readers who are going to the United States to study or travel.

Preparations Before Going Abroad

(1) Request for Admission: Those who intend to study in the United States should request admission from the selected school at least three months before going abroad. The documents required for the request include school transcripts (listing in detail the courses, credits, and grades selected in the four years of university), a letter of recommendation from the principal or director (stating the applicant's experience, ability, source of funds, and subject of study after arriving in the United States), and a completed application form, photos, etc. The rules of each school are different, so it is best to refer to the school's regulations (if there is no regulation, you can ask the China Travel Service or the World Student Association, etc., to read it). After the American school approves the admission, it will send back a reply letter with two admission certificates, which are necessary for applying for a passport and landing in the United States. The exchange of letters for the above request for admission usually takes about two months. If the time is tight, you can send it by airmail, or if you want to speed it up, you can ask the school to reply by telegram, but the telegram fee must be borne by the applicant.

(2) Applying for a Passport: In this extraordinary period, the procedures for applying for a passport cannot be handled in the same way as in previous years. The original passport issuing authority in Shanghai has long been closed, so it is only possible to apply to the General Affairs Department of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs for a Section Six Certificate) to replace the passport. The procedure for applying for this certificate only requires filling out an application form, along with two recent 4.5-inch half-length photos of the applicant, and a fee of 2 yuan. You can pick it up on the same day after collecting it from the Customs.

(3) Booking a Ship: Every year in August and September in autumn, there are many students studying in the United States, so those who go abroad during this period must book a cabin early to avoid being unable to find a seat at the last minute. The procedure for booking a ship is not complicated. Two or three months before deciding on the date of departure, you can book a cabin at the China Travel Service, and you can also handle other study abroad procedures. When booking a cabin, you should pay a deposit of 25% of the ticket price for each class, which will be used as part of the fare before going abroad. Second class or Tourist Class passengers are treated the same as first class passengers upon landing, and the enjoyment on the ship is also good. Although third-class passengers are not as convenient as first and second class passengers when landing, there are no special difficulties. For the sake of comfort and convenience of landing, it is best to take a second-class cabin. When the ship passes Honolulu, you can go ashore for sightseeing, but it is more difficult in third class. The most famous routes from Shanghai to the United States are the American President Lines (formerly Da Lai and American Mail Company merged) and the Changxing Company. American ships land in San Francisco or Los Angeles, and the Queen ships of Changxing Company end in Vancouver, Canada. Those who are going to the United States can be sent to Seattle for landing by a special small boat sent by the company when they arrive at Victoria Island. Upon landing, the Immigration Bureau and Customs do not deliberately embarrass Chinese students or tourists going to the United States. Train tickets after arriving in the United States can also be pre-ordered from the China Travel Service, which will issue a ticket exchange coupon, so that when you arrive in the United States, a representative of the railway company will take care of everything for you, which can save a lot of trouble.

(4) Physical Examination: Before applying for a signature from the American consul, you must have a certificate of good health. All American consulates have approved doctors who can do this kind of examination. The list of approved doctors and the blank physical examination forms of the various shipping companies can be obtained from the China Travel Service. Passengers traveling in third class must undergo a physical examination by a doctor approved by the US consulate, and then, when boarding the ship temporarily, they must go to the chief physician of the ship they are traveling on at the agreed time for a physical examination. If it is considered qualified, they can get a ticket and board the ship to go abroad, otherwise they will not be able to leave.

(5) Please have the U.S. Consul sign the sixth certificate issued by the Customs and the health certificate before going to the U.S. Consulate to request an endorsement. The consulate is convenient for the passport holder to reside in the most recent place in the past year. For example, if the home is in Shanghai and the most recent year is in Peiping, it should be handled in Tianjin. If it is handled in Shanghai, there must be a certificate from the Consulate in Tianjin that the applicant has not been rejected in Tianjin, and the Consulate in Tianjin shall entrust the Consulate in Shanghai to handle it before it can be signed. When applying, submit: passport or sixth certificate, letter of introduction from the school or institution, a letter from the sending institution guaranteeing sufficient public funds (publicly funded students) or a letter of economic guarantee from the banking community (self-funded students), a letter of admission or telegram from an American school, a letter of guarantee from parents, along with three recent 4-inch photos, and go to the nearest U.S. Consulate to request an endorsement of the entry passport. Only after the consul has reviewed and approved it, can the sixth certificate be filled out. After filling it out, the traveler will send the certificate to the Jianghai Customs, which will be signed and stamped by the person in charge, and then take it to the U.S. Consulate. When the departure date is approaching, the doctor's certificate, the booking voucher, and a fee of US$10 for the signature shall be paid, and the consular office will issue a stateless immigrant entry certificate, and then the ticket can be purchased to the United States. If you are traveling or doing business, the procedures are largely the same, you can ask the China Travel Service and other places about everything.

(6) Purchase of tickets After all the procedures have been completed, a few days before going abroad, you can submit the sixth certificate, health certificate, and the stateless immigrant entry certificate issued by the U.S. Consul to the pre-booked cabin agency, and fill out the cabin list (Manifestform) of the shipping company. Two papers, and then make up the fare and pay the U.S. government's poll tax of US$8, you can get the required ticket. However, third-class passengers need to have the ship's doctor examine their health before issuing tickets. After all the procedures are completed, you can wait to board the ship. As for sending luggage when boarding the ship, it is best to entrust it to the travel agency, which is not only safe, but also takes care of everything before the ship sails. (To be continued)

### Chongqing Transportation News

— Ti Chang

I recently received several messages regarding passenger and freight transportation in Chongqing, and I am reporting them separately as follows:

(1) Aviation: 1. The China National Aviation Corporation's Chongqing-Hejiang line has resumed flights, scheduled to fly once a week. However, the flight schedule and dates are not fixed. 2. The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's various routes remain as before. 3. The China National Aviation Corporation's Chongqing-Jialing line, originally flying round-trip on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, has now changed to flying round-trip on Wednesdays and Fridays. The flight time has not changed.

(2) Shipping: 1. The Minsheng Company's Chongqing-Jialing-Qianwei (Chongqing via Xufu to Jiading) route is now divided into two sections. There are many ships traveling between Chongqing and Xufu. Between Xufu and Jiading, only the "Minjue" and "Minxuan" steamers operate. The remaining vessels will only be able to resume sailing one after the water level rises. 2. Since Chongqing Municipality issued an order to evacuate the population, many short-haul shipping services on the upper reaches have been established. The traffic is quite busy. In order to dominate the Sichuan River shipping industry, the Minsheng Company is using steam launches, setting up docks in various places to attract passengers.

(3) Highways: 1. Due to the recent requisitioning of vehicles by the Military Affairs Commission and the scarcity of export goods, many commercial vehicles that used to travel the Southwest Highway have switched to the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway. Therefore, freight transport from Chongqing to Chengdu is extremely smooth. I heard that the freight cost from Chongqing to Chengdu is 500 yuan per ton, but the return freight is not much, only 220 yuan per ton. 2. I heard that the Military Affairs Commission will organize a Transportation Headquarters to control various transportation agencies in the Southwest and Northwest. Even the Southwest and Northwest Highway Bureau and the Water and Land Transportation Coordination Committee will be merged. 3. At the end of last month, the Southwest Highway was ordered to prepare vehicles for population evacuation, planning to evacuate over 10,000 people within a month. Registration procedures have been entrusted to the China Travel Service. The ticket price from Haitangxi to Qijiang and other places is reduced by one-third, but the return fare is still charged at the full price. Sichuan Highway has also started short-distance services to Xiaolongkan, Shanding, Beibei, and other places to help with the evacuation.

(4) General Import and Export Goods: 1. In the week of mid-June, Chongqing's imports included 30 tons of dyes, 54 tons of gasoline, 8 tons of hardware, 36 tons of electrical materials, 30 tons of piece goods, 12 tons of cotton yarn, 6 tons of cigarettes, 4 tons of machinery, 2 tons of kerosene, 24 tons of general merchandise, and 4 tons of books. 2. Exports included 188 tons of tung oil, 4 tons of wool, 26 tons of gunny sacks, 43 tons of bristles, 49 tons of medicinal materials, 26 tons of raw lacquer, 6 tons of tree fungus, 1 ton of rabbit skins, 22 tons of salt, and 1 ton of white silk.

### Shanghai Shipping Dynamics (Continued)

— Jing

The Africa Sector

For ships departing from Shanghai to various parts of Africa, there is only the Royal Netherlands Mail Steamer Company (Koninklijke Paketvaart Maatschappij, abbreviated as K.P.M.), managed by the Java Shipping Company. Its route goes from Shanghai via Hong Kong, Luzon, Saigon, Bangkok, Singapore, Batavia, Madagascar (near Africa), then along the African coast to the important African port of Cape Town (also known as Cape City, the commercial city of the Cape of Good Hope). The company's ships include the "Shi Shu Yun," "De Qi Bao," "Luo Si," and other giant ships, each over 15,000 tons and newly built. They have first, second, and steerage class cabins and are the only route from Shanghai to Africa.

The Australia Sector

For ships departing from Shanghai to Australia, there is only the Eastern and Australian S.S. Co., managed by the British company here. The route goes from Shanghai via Kobe, Osaka, Yokohama, Kobe, Hong Kong, Luzon to Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne (i.e., New Gold Mountain) in Australia. The ships include the "Nanjing," "Nairo," "Dan Da," and others, each around 7,000 tons, with first and second-class cabins. Those traveling from Shanghai to Australia mostly go to Hong Kong first and transfer to the above-mentioned company's ships to go to Australia. If one takes the company's ship directly from Shanghai to Australia, it would have to go through various Japanese ports, which would take a long time. It is faster to transfer ships in Hong Kong.

The Nanyang Sector

For ships from Shanghai to various ports in Nanyang, besides a few European and African liners that occasionally stop, only the Java Shipping Company has dedicated routes. The company's routes are divided into "First" and "Second" classes. The first route goes from Shanghai via Xiamen, Hong Kong, Luzon, Cebu, Manado, Makassar, Bali to Surabaya. The ships include the "Zhini Jianada" and "Zhisha Danni," with tonnage of about 10,000 tons and classes divided into first, second, third, and fourth. The second route goes from Shanghai via Xiamen, Hong Kong, Wendao, Batavia, Cirebon, Semarang to Surabaya. On the return trip, it also stops at Tanjung Priok. The ships include the "Zhisha Luya," "Zhibade," "Zhisha Li," and other ships, which are smaller in tonnage, and the cabin classes are the same as before. This is the only route from Shanghai to various places in Nanyang, Java.

The Japan Sector

Besides American and European liners that occasionally stop, there are also the "Gonghai Maru" and "Nagasaki Maru" of the Japan Mail Steamship Company, which directly sail between Shanghai and Nagasaki/Kobe. The schedules are very frequent, and the tonnage and facilities of the ships are excellent. Passengers traveling to Japan like to take them. (The situation of routes to various ports in Japan and Annam will be continued).

### Yunnan Highway

Automobile Passenger Ticket Prices

The Yunnan Province highway automobile service is named Yunnan Automobile Company and is divided into the Kunming-Dali, Kunming-Yangjie, Kunming-Panxian, Kunming-Wangxi, and Kunming-Xuanwei sections.

If we were to publish all the letters one after another, it would be outdated. Therefore, readers who have urgent problems that need to be solved should come to the branches of the China Travel Service in this city to inquire in person. The agency will provide detailed answers to everything. Also, according to the regulations, we regret that we cannot answer letters that do not have postage stamps affixed.

### The Condition of Steam Boilers in Shanghai (Continued and Concluded)

— Jin Zhixuan

Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau and the Public Works Departments of the First and Second Special Districts both believe that for the sake of public safety, technical issues regarding the construction and installation of boilers must be properly regulated. The Social Bureau, because it needs to be consistent with the implementation of the factory regulations of the Ministry of Industry, is formulating detailed rules for boiler manufacturing on the one hand and carrying out registration procedures on the other hand, but is now suspended due to the war. The Public Works Department of the Second Special District (French Concession) conducts registration and inspection procedures on its own. In September of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), the French Municipal Council also promulgated the Steam Engine Management Regulations. The Industrial Section of the Public Works Department of the First Special District (International Settlement) conducted surveys and inspections of boilers within the boundary in the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic of China (1934 and 1935). Since January of the 25th year (1936), it has also promulgated and implemented the Rules for the Installation of Steam Engines and Other Steam Pressure Machines (Notice No. 4677) and has also handled the registration of engineers. According to statistics from various countries in the world, 75% of industrial accidents, such as boiler explosions, are due to mismanagement. On the other hand, when studying China's current social organization, the responsibility for mismanagement is often placed on illiterate and incapable stokers. Ms. Xing De, the head of the Industrial Section, accommodating suggestions from all parties, deeply believes that "punishing without teaching" is inappropriate. Therefore, she started training classes in the summer of the 26th year (1937), with each class lasting six weeks. The first class graduated on June 17th, with a total of 21 students. The second class graduated on January 18th of the 27th year (1938), with a total of 25 students. The third class had 36 students and graduated on August 2nd. The fourth class had 32 students and graduated on October 4th. The fifth class started on December 2nd of this year (1938), with the number of listeners increasing to as many as 96 people. Li Yuncheng, Hu Song, Yan Liping, and the author joined as volunteer lecturers. The topics covered focused on boiler safety, divided into two major parts: boiler structure and operation. It is estimated that by December of the 29th year (1940), there will be 500 stokers and managers (approximately 40%) within the First Special District who have been trained. On the one hand, the Industrial Section, from a third-party perspective, investigates the trained stokers and managers in various factories. There have been very obvious improvements in their work measures. Therefore, it is often known that their safety in operation has invisibly increased a lot. At the same time, it can also be shown that mechanical education by engineers can enable even illiterate stokers to understand with the simplest and most accurate rules, and at the same time test whether they have benefited from listening, in order to achieve the purpose of "no one in the world is unteachable." The lecture schedule for the six weeks is briefly listed below:

First Week: Focus on the shortcomings in the structure of various boilers in Shanghai based on practical experience.

Shortcomings in the installation, operation, and maintenance of various boilers in Shanghai related to safety.

Second Week: Various materials for manufacturing boilers

Boiler Management

Third Week: Various styles and principles of boilers

Boiler Protection

Fourth Week: Same as above

Legal Repairs of Boilers

Fifth Week: The construction and installation of various boiler parts

Management and Protection of Various Boiler Parts

Sixth Week: Various materials and structures connected to the boiler, such as steam and water pipes

Installation and Protection of Various Steam and Water Pipes

The above twelve items are completed in 24 hours, twice a week, two hours each time.

Since the outbreak of the war, most of the factories in the eastern part of the First Special District have been largely suspended or destroyed. The situation is similar in Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong. Therefore, new factories in western Shanghai and on roads beyond the boundary have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Although the Public Works Departments of the First and Second Special Districts still pay close attention to boilers, after all, it is a matter of public safety. It seems that residents living within the boundary should also pay attention to it within the possible scope.

### Isolation Hospitals

Infectious diseases are related to public health. Therefore, infectious disease hospitals should be run by the government and should be isolated from ordinary hospitals. Given the large population and the high incidence of diseases in this city, the treatment of infectious diseases is very necessary. The isolation hospital run by the Municipal Health Bureau was formerly in Zhabei, specializing in the treatment of seasonal infectious diseases, and was quite large in scale. It was closed after the August 13th Incident. The only existing ones are the isolation hospitals in the First and Second Special Districts. The hospital in the Second Special District is attached to the Guangci Hospital. The one set up in the First Special District was formerly in Shenjiawan and has now been moved, with three temporary hospitals set up separately. One is on Xinzha Road, exclusively for Chinese people, with three doctors. One is on Beihai Road, with three doctors. One is on Bailinan Road, exclusively for foreigners, with two doctors. The above three places each have 20 beds. Since the outbreak of the war, the number of patients has increased daily, but the majority are poor and refugees. The expenses are paid by the Public Works Department. The director of the hospital is Dr. W.R. Johnston.

A Brief Overview of Medical Treatment for Wounded Soldiers in Shanghai Hospitals During the August 13th War: When the August 13th Incident occurred in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the city established a Relief Committee, setting up wounded soldier distribution stations and 24 relief hospitals, as well as 14 relief hospitals run by other relief organizations or private individuals to respond to emergencies. However, when the war first broke out, the relief hospitals were not fully established. In fact, all major hospitals admitted wounded soldiers and civilians. Later, in order to seek rapid medical treatment, the Relief Committee negotiated with several hospitals to also admit wounded soldiers and subsidized the hospitals that accepted wounded soldiers at 50 cents per day per person for medicine and food. There were 16 such special hospitals, with a total of 900 beds, which greatly helped in the diagnosis and treatment of wounded soldiers. Later, the relief hospitals were gradually established, and the number of beds increased daily. In order to manage and facilitate things, the Relief Committee closed all the special hospitals and moved all the wounded soldiers into the relief hospitals. A list of these special hospitals is shown below: (To be continued)

### A Dragon Passes Over Nanhui City

In summer, when you see clouds hanging horizontally in the sky with dragon tails hanging down, large and small, it is commonly called the "dragon taking water." Flat clouds are called "dragon racks." It is common and not surprising to see this in coastal areas. However, in front of Nanhui City the other day, at noon, the fire was scorching the sky, and it was extremely hot! Looking up at the sky, only a few clouds were visible in the northern and southeastern corners, with white tops and black feet, and otherwise, it was endless blue. Unexpectedly, at the height of the red sun, a huge sound like wind and waves suddenly came from the northwest, mixed with crackling and rumbling sounds, and the cries for help from men, women, old, and young. I suspected there was a fire nearby. I was shocked and went out to see that there was a red light coming from outside the northwest city, rushing into the sky. In the red light, there was dust and sand blocking the sky, and roofs, beams, pillars, boxes, cabinets, tables, and chairs were flying in mid-air. Upon closer inspection, the red light gradually disappeared, and a dragon tail was hanging near the northwest city, reaching down to the battlements. Only then did I realize that the houses were sucked up by the dragon's breath, hence the huge sound. Before long, the dragon entered the city gracefully, its head pointing southeast, passing through the city, about four or five zhang above the ground. The streets and alleys were filled with astonishment! Some stood watching, some ran to avoid it, some lit incense, some splashed dung, some used iron tools and rice beans to throw at the roof. Women cried, children wept, and the whole city was in turmoil, but the dragon lay across the city as before. Leisurely and calmly, it slowly came out. It took about an hour from the time it entered the city to the time it left, so the residents were able to examine its form and substance. At that time, there was a gunboat in the moat of the north gate, which flew into the air and then fell horizontally into the river. Its awnings and belongings were all gone. A Taoist priest felt his feet leave the ground and quickly grabbed a tree branch and held on tight. As soon as he held on, his feet were suspended in the air, and his face was injured by the tree branches. Fortunately, he came down soon; otherwise, it would have been like ascending to heaven in broad daylight. A foolish woman tried to splash dung on the roof, but before the dung could be splashed out, her body had been lifted over the city river, her body covered in dung, and her face was swollen and blue. Those who saw it laughed at her! After the incident, it was estimated that a total of about twenty or thirty tile and thatched houses were uncovered inside and outside the city, and none of the belongings inside the houses remained.

### Orphanage Flooded

— Floating Cloud

Over Fifty Orphans First Moved to the Philanthropic United Association Residence, with Teachers and Matrons Hired to Pay Attention to Diet and Education.

At Fifteen or Sixteen Years Old, They Are Sent to the Refugee Vocational Training Center to Learn Skills.

Due to continuous heavy rains, the orphanage on Jules Speegher Road was flooded, and the water could not recede, making it uninhabitable. They were temporarily housed in the Philanthropic United Association. To understand the lives of the orphans, I visited the association the next day. I am now publishing my observations, hoping to inform those who care about the orphans and fulfill their desire to know.

As I walked through the gates of the Philanthropic United Association, I saw several wide and long benches placed in the glass-roofed courtyard of Renji Hall, surrounded by dozens of innocent and lively little angels. On the benches were many blue enamel bowls and bamboo chopsticks, and next to them was a wooden bucket filled with white rice, as well as two lead buckets, one containing braised cabbage and the other containing broad bean winter melon soup. An older orphan, about seventeen or eighteen years old, (note: the orphanage does not call them older or younger orphans, but refers to them all as elementary and college students) was using an iron spoon to serve the vegetables into large bowls. Each class received two bowls of vegetables, and then the class leader of each class divided the vegetables into eight small vegetable bowls (note: each class has a total of eight people, including two class leaders; one class leader serves the vegetables, and the other serves the rice). Another college student stood in front of the large wooden bucket, receiving the rice bowls from the class leaders and placing them on the long benches one by one, with one dish and one bowl of rice for each person. Once everything was set, the children stood silently in front of the benches, and Director Zhang, who was in charge of the orphanage and whose hair was almost completely white, stood in the middle and respectfully offered a prayer, roughly thanking heaven for providing food and blessing the country and philanthropists. Only then did everyone begin to eat. After finishing one bowl, they went to refill it one by one. Although not as solemn as a monk's dining hall, it was orderly. These children, who were only four or five to twelve or thirteen years old, could have such discipline. Without regular training and education, there would not be such good results.

The current orphanage is the former Shanghai Orphanage in Longhua. In addition to the director, there are two teachers and four matrons, who are responsible for paying attention to the children's warmth, cleanliness, and order. A "mama" (i.e., nanny) is in charge of washing clothes and mending torn clothes. Teachers teach every day.

There are currently about one hundred people in the orphanage. About half of them are temporarily staying at the Philanthropic United Association, while the other half remain at the orphanage. The Philanthropic United Association provides rice, which is cooked by themselves. The daily vegetable money is two yuan and fifty cents. They eat porridge in the morning and rice for lunch and dinner. Except for the older children who are responsible for service, those who reach the age of fifteen or sixteen are sent to the refugee vocational training center to learn skills. Most of those currently housed are orphans who lost their parents at a young age, with a few sent by their families. However, their families have all been affected by the war and are now living in refugee camps. I saw this group of energetic little angels, and in their eating, listening, and other actions, there was no hint of sorrow. Each of them showed a happy expression. I talked to an older orphan about having two kinds of vegetables with each meal, and a child of nearly ten years old interrupted and said, "Hey, we didn't have that in the refugee camp!" Hearing this, I smiled and nodded at him, indicating my agreement. He smiled and jumped up onto the main hall (the main hall is where Renji Hall enshrines Guan Sheng Di Jun). I loved their innocence, and I saw their lively attitude, which seemed to give me a lot of comfort. At the same time, I am also grateful to the enthusiastic philanthropists in society for their merits in protecting them.

### Echoes of "An Urgent Appeal"

— Several Members of the Shanghai Refugee Production and Consumption Limited Liability Cooperative

Editor:

We were so excited and moved when we read the "Letter from Nineteen Teachers" published in your column the day before yesterday, and we express our utmost sympathy to them. Undoubtedly, we are in the same dire situation, so we should join hands and use collective strength to solve our essential living problems towards the same goal.

We hope that you will send a message to these nineteen teachers: the consumer cooperative they need has already been established by us. We will also expand it to the production cooperation aspect, because all the refugees in Shanghai not only feel the difficulty of high prices in consumption, but also suffer from the pain of reduced wages in production. We earnestly hope that the nineteen teachers will join this cooperative and work together to break through the thorns ahead, turning it into the only self-sufficient place for the refugees in Shanghai. Our cooperative's address is 185 Luban Road, French Concession. Telephone number 80074.

### Female Workers in Tea Warehouses Also Have "Contract Labor"

— Jin Ding

Wages are Split in Half with Older Female Workers; Like Apprentices, They Must Complete Three Years to Graduate.

New tea is on the market, and when we drink new tea, we should pay attention to the lives of these female tea workers.

Speaking of these female tea workers who pick tea, their lives are truly miserable. I often go to tea warehouses to observe and see them picking tea from six o'clock in the morning until five thirty in the afternoon. Except for the necessary meals and bathroom breaks, they spend the entire eleven hours hunched over, heads buried, hands constantly picking out dirt and short stems from the coarse tea. However, how much money can they earn each day for such hard work? It's truly "God knows."

Originally, their wages are calculated based on the number of baskets. For each basket of tea picked, they earn seventy copper coins. In a day, the most skilled can only pick thirteen baskets of tea leaves, while ordinary workers can only pick seven, eight, or nine baskets. Therefore, their highest wage is nine hundred copper coins, which amounts to only thirty cents in silver. The lowest is only four hundred and ninety copper coins, up to seven hundred and twenty copper coins. May I ask: with such high living costs, even if each person is given thirty cents in silver, who knows what good things they can buy? Moreover, some only earn ten-odd cents in wages.

Among these many female tea workers, if you investigate carefully, you will unexpectedly find even more tragic and pitiful situations. According to a tea shop employee, young female tea workers are brought in by older female workers. The shop stipulates that each older female worker can bring three young female workers. After they bring in young female workers, half of the young female workers' daily wages must be given to the older female workers as a tribute. This continues for three years, after which they have the right to receive the full wage. At this time, they can also start bringing in young female workers. Who would have thought that within the miserable working class, there are also such exploiters and exploited classes? This is truly regrettable.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

Chapter 13: Encouraging Agricultural Education to Accumulate Talent for the Country; Retaining the Strong and Eliminating the Weak, Selecting Seeds with a Field.

Village Chief Zhu asked, "What is it?" Field Manager Ge said, "First, starting next spring, we plan to add a class of students. Traditionally, this field has not had students. Besides our fixed staff, we hire people temporarily to help during the silkworm season. From next year, we want to train a class of students, not many, only sixty. Among these sixty people, half are male and half are female. They must have graduated from junior high school and be over sixteen years old. There are two types of graduation: one-year and three-year. The focus is on practical training. From planting mulberry trees to raising silkworms, picking cocoons, and selecting seeds, everything must be practiced. However, seed selection is more detailed, so in-depth study requires three years of graduation. We cultivate talent for two purposes: one for our own use and one for others to use. China's silk exports are growing year by year. Since Japan's sericulture industry has declined, we have dominated the market. This is because the world's silk is used more and more widely, not only in clothing but also in many new devices that require silk. Artificial silk cannot replace it. For example, parachutes on airplanes. The texture must be light, smooth, and strong. Many aviators have tested and determined that they must be made of silk, and they must be made of Chinese silk. This concerns people's lives, so artificial silk cannot be used. This export alone is significant. We haven't investigated the others in detail, but in general, the world's use of silk is increasing. For this reason, China's sericulture industry is booming. As the sericulture industry develops, seed production fields naturally increase. We must not only encourage silkworm farming but also train personnel for seed production fields. This is for our own use. Also, recently, silkworm farming is not only limited to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces but has also spread to Sichuan, Guangdong, and Yunnan provinces. Shandong, Henan, and other provinces are also gradually becoming silkworm farming provinces. Wherever a place is developed, the most important thing is people. The emerging China feels the lack of talent everywhere. They believe that Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are the birthplaces of silkworm farming, so they come to Jiangsu to seek talent. In reality, the talent in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has also been exhausted. Therefore, we must urgently cultivate them. So we cultivate them, half for our own use and half to send to other provinces. Now, other provinces also have seed production fields, but they suffer from a lack of talent." Village Chief Zhu said, "Ah! Now, many inland provinces want to develop, and they always feel the lack of talent. The other day, a friend of mine who served in the military came to the village and mentioned that Nanjing University has graduated more than six thousand agricultural students this year, all of whom have been hired by inland provinces, and not a single one is left. There are also many who have not yet graduated, and it's like ordering goods in a factory, they have already been booked by others." (155)

### "Dragon and Tiger Storm"

— Bai Hua

"Stand up and fight"

Produced by MGM, Shown at the Nanjing Grand Theater

"Dragon and Tiger Storm" has a very complicated story, which can be roughly divided into the following three main lines: Lake loses his fortune due to poor management, leading to the auction of his property, becoming a station coachman, and then working hard to become the Western manager of a railway company; Black's aunt Amanda and cousin Susan start a freight transport company; The relationship between Starkey and the slave trader Morgan. In this complex story, the playwright fails to connect them in a fused way, but allows them to develop in parallel, especially after Starkey appears, the play is completely separated from the previous ones. If the playwright could focus on Black's struggle, "Dragon and Tiger Storm" would certainly be more successful than it is now.

Therefore, even a great director like Vandyke can only deal with each scene locally, and cannot connect the whole play, and there are even many fragmented transition scenes.

In outlining the character of Starkey (Wales Beale), Vandyke shows his dignified power. From the moment Starkey appears, he firmly grasps his character. What is particularly successful is the scene where Starkey and Black (Robert Taylor) fight for the second time in the snow, which is not only delicate and exquisite (for example, after Starkey is knocked down, he wakes up, drinks water, and sees Black also collapsing powerlessly by the tree roots, so he doesn't even look at him straight and hands over the water bottle. When Black is about to get on his horse, Starkey looks at the pistol in his hand and also looks at the pistol in Black's saddlebag, and hides his pistol. Later, the two men trudge forward in the snow and finally fall in the snow. And the two men are written from opposition to challenge, which is very touching. Wales Beale and Black shouted Stand up and fight after knocking each other down, implying that the success of any career requires this spirit of perseverance, and Black is an example of working hard and jumping up repeatedly.

Other examples include the success of the railway, which finally surprised stubborn opponents: the first time the train competed with the horse-drawn carriage, the train retreated when it reached the highlands, and the passengers jumped down and pushed it, and the horse-drawn carriage chased it past. The second time the train was successful, he used a cow lying on the rails and refusing to get up. This contrast is very clever.

Wales Beale is a rare actor, and his Starkey is the best. Robert Taylor has made significant progress since "Healthy Boy." Black here can't be said to be weak, but when he confronts Wales Beale, he inevitably pales in comparison.

Therefore, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw in "Dragon and Tiger Storm" is that it does not focus on Black's play as the main line, but stands side by side with Starkey. This makes the whole play loose on the one hand, and also weakens the power of the theme.

Germany Issues Arrest Warrant for Mickey Mouse

Cartoons Also Banned

The Arrest Warrant Has Not Been Revoked to This Day

Walt Disney's cartoons are banned in Germany; the reason for the ban is said to be that the strange-looking characters "offend public decency." Among them, the German authorities particularly dislike Mickey Mouse. For more than ten years, Mickey Mouse films have been absolutely forbidden to appear on German screens.

Germany's ban on Mickey Mouse films dates back to 1926, when the National Socialist Party already had considerable influence in Germany. They believed that Mickey Mouse was a "villainous character who does all kinds of evil," which could easily have a bad influence on the people, so they prompted the government to issue a ban. Who knew that this ban would cause an unprecedented joke, so that "Mr. Mickey Mouse" is still wanted by the German government to this day—believe it or not, but this is absolutely true!

The thing is this: just as the government issued an order to ban Mickey Mouse films, the newspapers all used large characters to publish Mickey Mouse's (Mickey) name, saying that he was a "typical hooligan." But coincidentally, on this day, Germany discovered an unprecedented theft: a small railway one hundred miles long, built by Germany in Romania during the Great War, had all its tracks stolen. After the discovery of this remarkable theft, the authorities immediately summoned the stationmaster in charge of the entire line for questioning. The stationmaster knew that he was at fault and could not shirk responsibility. Just as he was hesitating, he suddenly remembered the name of that "typical hooligan," Mickey Mouse, which he had seen in the newspaper that day. He didn't know what "Mickey Mouse" was at all, he only thought that he was a famous bad guy, so he had a stroke of genius and completely shifted the blame for the track theft onto him. The stationmaster's confession was:

"The perpetrator of the track theft has been identified as a famous fugitive rogue named Mickey Mouse..."

Therefore, the German government authorities, based on his confession, immediately ordered the arrest of the "fugitive" Mickey Mouse.

This arrest warrant has not been canceled to this day.

Random Notes from Performing Artists

### Thoughts on Acting (Part 2)

— Qiu Xia

No wonder Paul Muni once played a great historical figure, and he shut himself up at home to study the deeds, personality, habits... etc. of this great historical figure for more than a month. Later, his friend came to visit him and said, "You have studied this person for so long, so the performance will definitely be successful!" But Paul Muni replied, "I don't think I have studied enough, because although I know a lot about him (i.e., a certain great historical figure) personally, I don't quite understand everything about his ancestors!" When we hear Paul Muni's words, it further proves the difficulty of filming and the hard work and effort of foreign artists.

Therefore, an actor should not only perform the "body" of the character in the play but also the "soul" of the character in the play.

So I said: "Filming is difficult, it is difficult to film."

There is also "the play is difficult to film, it is difficult to film the play." For example, an actor is only suitable for playing certain roles due to the limitations of his personality, and not suitable for playing other roles, but this actor has never been able to play a play that fits his personality due to the relationship of opportunity, and always plays a play that is contrary to his personality. Or, a certain person's appearance is not suitable for playing ancient costumes, but only suitable for playing modern costumes, then this person is really bitter enough. Of course, a successful actor should be multifaceted, but relatively speaking, a certain role is more likely to develop his strengths when played by a certain person, otherwise, it will definitely be thankless. And on the contrary, it will bury this talent.

So I said: This is "the play is difficult to film, it is difficult to film the play."

However, it must be said again, if an actor is constantly cultivating and training, then not only the above many difficulties, but even any difficulties can be overcome. Therefore, cultivation and training are not only compulsory courses for every actor, but can simply be said to be necessary for life.

Just like a person who wants to sing, but does not practice "vocal music", a person who wants to dance, but does not learn "footwork", then success is not for him.

I have spent four years in the film industry in vain, and I often feel that my experience and knowledge are not enough, and my cultivation and training are even more lacking. Therefore, I have to sigh: "Filming is difficult, it is difficult to film, the play is difficult to film, it is difficult to film the play." At the same time, I feel very urgently that I need cultivation and training, and I often talk to my friends in the film industry, and we all have the same feeling.

The above can be said to be a part of my thoughts on acting in the past four years. It is written in a disorganized way and cannot form an article. It can only be said that it is a way to satisfy the editor.

### Bird's-Eye View of Shanghai Cinemas (Part 2)

— Shu Xiaochun

The selection of films by theaters is very important for nutrition. The four major theaters that show first-run foreign films have been mentioned earlier, but they are affiliated with Asia Film Company, so there is no need to compete. They are only distributed according to the environmental needs of the locations of each theater and the preferences of the customers. Although these four theaters specialize in showing first-run foreign films, there are exceptions, such as the screening of the Chinese film "Diao Chan" at the Grand Theater, and the screening of the foreign film "Marie Antoinette" at the Grand Shanghai after it was screened at the Nanjing Theater. Most of the theaters that show first-run Chinese films have signed contracts with certain film companies to obtain the first screening rights. The theaters that show second-run foreign films, such as Lido, Jinmen, Paris, and Guanglu, have a joint contract and specialize in showing films from six film companies, such as MGM, Paramount, and Fox. Except for the first-run premium films, which must be screened after a period of six months, the others can be screened after two or three months. Heguang and Pingan mostly show MGM and RKO films. The films shown in the third-run theaters are mostly old, but the business is quite developed. It is by no means comparable to the past when they only used "grass skirt dances" to attract audiences. Once a famous film is shown, it is crowded, and even the side doors are broken down, such as Warner's "Submarine No. 1" being shown at the West Sea Theater.

Film companies and cinemas have now mostly changed from "guaranteed accounts" to "revenue sharing." The size of the "discount" depends on the quality of the film and the date of screening. In the past year, the films with the highest box office were "Robin Hood" for foreign films and "Mulan Joins the Army" for Chinese films.

The customers of cinemas have different components. Generally speaking, the audience for first-run foreign films is mostly wealthy businessmen and famous ladies. The audience for first-run Chinese films is mostly female. The audience for second-run films is mostly young students. The cartoon on Sundays is almost entirely young brothers and sisters. The third-run theaters have the most complex audience because the prices are low, and disputes often arise. This may also be one reason. In terms of location, the Cathay Theater has more foreign guests, the Paris Theater has more "Romanians," the Guanglu Theater has more "foreign company employees," the Lido and Jinmen Theaters have more "high school and middle school students," and the New Light and Jincheng Theaters have more "female students" and "dancers." Each theater also has a group of "old customers" who must watch every film and are even familiar with the theater staff. These can be called "movie fans."

There are many miracles in the cinema. In the lobby, young men and women wait for each other. If they wait, they are happy. If they wait in vain, they are disappointed. This is not surprising. In the theater, a couple occupies a corner, and their sweet words of love are even better than the great lovers on the screen. This is also not surprising. Here are three things that you may not have heard before, as anecdotes to end this article.

Last year, in a certain large theater, there was a young and beautiful male customer who came every day and every show, rain or shine, and always sat in seat No. XX in the flower hall. It cost five yuan for the tickets every day, and he spent it for several months. The theater staff found it strange and spoke to him occasionally, and he spoke fluent English and German. After several inquiries, they learned from his chauffeur that he was the son of a famous doctor Ding, and he was using the theater to relieve his sorrows because of a broken love.

There was also a large theater where a waiter saw a beautiful woman dressed in gorgeous clothes coming out of the women's restroom with sleepy eyes when he was cleaning before the iron gate was opened in the morning. Everyone was shocked and asked her because she didn't look like a human. They learned that she had entered the theater last night when the show ended. The servant woman who managed the women's restroom had already left, so she was allowed to stay here and take a nap until dawn. Those who knew her knew that she was a woman with the surname of XX, who had been to various theaters. She was also a person who had been disappointed in love, and her nerves were not healthy, so she made this big joke.

### Anecdotes from Liyuan

— Xu Muyun

The Reason Why Jin Shaoshan Became So Popular After Going to Beijing

There was a time when he was the leading actor in a certain theater, which made Mr. Wang (Yao Qing) so angry that he would say to everyone he met: "A strange thing has appeared in our Liyuan line. I have never heard of any senior Jing role actors being the leading actor. Can his skills compare to Mr. He Jiu, Jin Xiushan, or Mu Fengshan? Even his role model, the living Cao Cao Huang Runpu, he can't catch up with them. But these old gentlemen never thought of being the leading actor. I don't know how capable he is to dare to be so pretentious!" Indeed, Shoushen was a bit too presumptuous. Moreover, his whole family are Christians, and his son is a college student. Therefore, although he makes a living from opera, he always scolds his colleagues in private. As things went on like this, of course, he offended many people. In secret, many people wrote letters to Shaoshan, inviting him to visit the north, so as to vent their anger on his behalf. Shao had left Beijing for more than ten years and had long wanted to leave Shanghai and return to his hometown. He often said, "I love the novels in Beijing the most. I can eat some snacks and fruits at will. I can go to small restaurants with a few friends, or go to Sanhai and Longevity Mountain. That's really fun." Therefore, he decided to go north the year before last. When he arrived in Beijing, the popularity of his performances in various theaters was simply more popular than anyone else. Even when he performed in Tianjin and various places outside the Guan, it was also unprecedentedly popular. Therefore, Mr. Hao, who was invincible, was so ashamed that he wanted to refuse to sing on stage from now on, saying that as long as Jin was in Beijing, he would never appear on stage. Later, I don't know how, he and Wan Chun collaborated on "Linked Rings," and on the same day, they set up a stage with Shao Shan and Shao Chun to perform a rival drama, turning the martial arts competition between Huang Tianba and Yierdun into a gambling match between Jin, Hao, and the two Lis. Both sides had people to support them. Of course, it was impossible to tell who was stronger in this short day of the play. However, if it lasted for a long time, I am afraid that Shoushen would still be defeated. Because Shao Shan is stronger than him in terms of voice, figure, and posture. What's more, Shao Shan has better connections with people inside and outside the industry. In addition, his father's golden brand, in Beijing, a place that worships idols, how could Shoushen be Shao Shan's enemy? —(55)—

Dance World Sketches (30)
— Xiao Tian

### Gold, Moon, and Flower - Third Star Chronicle

"The moon is there, the moon is there," isn't that the most popular song in dance halls nowadays? Currently, the price of gold has surpassed all previous highs, making it extremely expensive. This one can be considered extremely expensive. This Miss (30) has the character "gold" in her surname and the character "moon" in her given name, so it's no wonder she's so popular right now. I'm not a character diviner, but I'm just thinking about what the name implies and writing about it.

Moon Flower! A petite figure, a round face, sparkling eyes, a clear voice, luxurious attire, and graceful manners – she can be considered a top talent in the dance world. When she was sixteen, she was already famous in Wuhan and was soon betrothed as a concubine to a certain division commander. She has been to places like Chongqing and Hong Kong, flown in airplanes thirteen times, and spent tens of thousands of dollars. Naturally, the wives and concubines of military men are not comparable to those in ordinary merchant families. As for the wives of poor, scholarly men, they probably wouldn't spend as much in their entire lives as she spends in a year and a half.

The first time I met her, she was cooling off with Fang Lili in the Metropolitan Garden. I nodded to her, but she ignored me. Later, I saw her a few more times, but we didn't greet each other. A few days ago, I was at the Great China Tea Dance, and she came in from outside. Suddenly, she graced my table, surprisingly chatting and laughing with me, and even danced two dances with me. In the end, I drove her home. She told me a lot about her experiences, some of which can be written about and some of which cannot. The ones that cannot be written about, I will naturally keep secret as she instructed. The ones that can be written about, I can only write half of them with my clumsy pen, so there is really very little left that can be satisfying for everyone.

She started joining the Celestial Music Palace as a dance partner on the evening of June 28th. According to her, there is no other relationship, just to earn some money to solve her living problems. She said that since she came to Shanghai, all the major dance halls have been vying to hire her. As a result, she finally entered the Celestial Music Palace, and all kinds of rumors have sprung up outside. I didn't know the content of these rumors, but she told me very frankly, but I cannot write it out very frankly as instructed. But she said that the rumors are completely unfounded. Chen Manli of the Paramount only gets 40% of the dance ticket revenue, while she can get a 70/30 split at the Celestial Music Palace. Boss Xie can be considered to value her especially. This is the only reason she entered the Celestial Music Palace.

After she entered the Celestial Music Palace, it is said that she always sits at four or five tables every day, but she still feels that business is not very good. She wants to tell all the guests not to think that she is a red star and looks down on five- or ten-yuan tickets. Although she has seen the world, she has a lot of tolerance and treats all customers equally. She also wants to tell all familiar customers that it's not that she's arrogant and doesn't greet people first, but that she's afraid people will say she's soliciting business. If you go to greet her, she will definitely not ignore you. She also has a skill that others can hardly hope to match, but I am sorry that I cannot write it out with this clumsy pen.

Opening Methods - Game Fifty-one

Black to Move First

Screen Horse vs. Central Cannon - Moves Following the Previous Game

Cannon 8 to 5 	Horse 3 advances 5 	Elephant 7 advances 5 	Cannon 8 retreats 1 	Chariot 9 to 8

Cannon 8 to 7 	Chariot 3 to 7 	Cannon 2 retreats 1 	Horse 3 advances 5 	Chariot 8 advances 4

Chariot 7 retreats 1 	Chariot 8 retreats 1 	Explanation

Cannon 2 to 5 to Horse 3 advances 4 is based on the changes in the previous game. In this game, after Horse 3 advances 4, the Cannon side still uses Cannon 8 to 5 to capture the central pawn. At this time, the Red side can only exchange Cannons with Horse 3 advances 5 to eliminate the opponent's momentum. Therefore, when the Cannon is removed, the Cannon side can only capture with the Elephant. If it is delayed a step further, then if the opponent advances Horse 3 to 5, they will definitely attack with the Cannon. Capturing with the Elephant is better than attacking with the Cannon. Cannon 8 retreats 1 to attack the Chariot, so as not to let the opponent pressure the Horse, is the Screen Horse method. Chariot 9 to 8 to Horse 3 advances 5 is the move for both sides (the move is to advance and defend). Chariot 8 advances 4 attacks the Cannon, waiting for the other side's Chariot to retreat to protect the Cannon and then retreat one to guard the important path.
