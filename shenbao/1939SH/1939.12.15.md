Editorial

### China and the Current League of Nations Assembly

The Finnish government submitted a case to the League of Nations regarding the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland. Yesterday, the League of Nations General Assembly passed a resolution: examining the facts and implementing the covenant; in addition to censuring the Soviet Union, urging member states to assist Finland; and allowing for the application of the League of Nations' resolution of October 4, 1937, regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, following the precedent; and judging that the Soviet Union has not only violated the covenant but has also isolated itself from the League of Nations. Yesterday, the representatives of forty member states attended the Assembly. At the time of the vote, nine countries abstained, including China; the remaining thirty-one countries unanimously approved the resolution. The detailed proceedings are published in today's newspaper. The League of Nations has expelled a member state, which is a first. Finland may take solace in this. Moreover, the Soviet Union began its invasion of Finland on the 30th of last month. As of yesterday, only half a month had passed, and the League of Nations had suddenly made such a resolution; while the Sino-Japanese issue resolution, which was invoked as a precedent, was reached by the League of Nations only after six years and half a month had passed since Japan launched its invasion of China on September 18, 1931. Comparing the two cases, the difference in treatment is obvious. Is this a sign of progress and sophistication in the League of Nations? How can we not sigh?

World opinion regarding the resolution of the current League of Nations Assembly is largely one of praise. However, from China's point of view, there are many things that cannot be readily agreed upon. China is one of the founding members of the League of Nations and one of the most loyal and supportive members. Chief Representative Gu Weijun was one of the key figures who helped create the League of Nations from the beginning. However, in this current Assembly, China did not want to simply follow the crowd. Therefore, it reversed its usual posture of attending gatherings, starting with silence and ending with abstention. "To speak to someone who can be spoken to is to gain a person; to speak to someone who cannot be spoken to is to waste words." China's passive stance toward the current League of Nations Assembly certainly does not run the risk of losing a person and definitely does not waste words. To say that it was out of fear or that it was only calculating its own interests and condoning wrongdoings is not true.

We deeply love the League of Nations, but we are extremely dissatisfied with its attitude. Taking the handling of the Soviet-Finnish issue as an example, the impression it gives us is nothing other than unfair and misguided. Those who respect the League of Nations are only bound by the constraints of the covenant and bear the obligations of the charter, but do not receive the effective guarantees that the covenant explicitly provides. What could be more unfair than this? Those who know that they are violating the covenant, know that they are disregarding public opinion, and voluntarily request to withdraw from the organization are able to roam freely outside the organization; while those who violate the covenant but have not expressed a desire to withdraw cannot escape the punishment of expulsion. What could be more unfair than this? In dealing with ongoing disputes, for one party, even if seemingly exhaustive measures are shown, they are actually empty and superficial; for the other party, even if so-called condemnation and so-called punishment are added, the reality is that the matter ends with withdrawal from the organization. What could be more misguided in handling disputes than this? Repeatedly inviting attendance is not because it is believed that there is a real hope of attendance, and there is a lack of sincerity in the invitation. However, the completeness of the procedure is quite visible. Asking for a cessation of aggression, asking for direct peace talks with the victim of aggression, is not because it is believed that this will lead to a ceasefire and negotiations. It is merely an action to fulfill one's duties as a human being, so as to demonstrate the perfectness of the maneuvering. As for how to resolve the difficulties and dispel the chaos, there is absolutely no responsibility to bear, and moreover, there is no assumption of a practical responsibility to try to resolve it. To only seek the completeness of procedures and the perfection of maneuvering in words and deeds, and to have absolutely no spirit of bearing responsibility, is the secret of corrupt bureaucrats. Using the secrets of bureaucrats as the basis for convening meetings, deliberating, and making decisions, what could be more misguided in handling disputes than this? The power of the League of Nations is insufficient to resolve international disputes, which is something we deeply know. However, an active spirit of seeking to resolve disputes should be the normal attitude of the League of Nations. To put it plainly, seeking to resolve must involve exerting effort to the very end. Expulsion should not be lightly resorted to now. Let us ask, has this current League of Nations Assembly exhausted all methods to seek to resolve the Finnish-Soviet dispute? Did all the measures taken during the session truly have the meaning of seeking to resolve the Finnish-Soviet dispute? Is the Assembly's resolution truly a measure after all attempts have failed, or is the resolution seen as the solution to the dispute? If someone were to make a judgment before things have happened, we would be dissatisfied with their attitude! To say that power is insufficient is a fact, and it is understandable. But if the spirit is insufficient, if the initiative is insufficient, if one is merely following the sequence of events, hastily gathering and dispersing, that is unacceptable! Argentina's righteousness is vigorous, and it is using its national membership status to fight for the removal of the Soviet Union. Upon hearing Argentina's proposal, the nations unanimously praised it as the ultimate in uprightness, justice, and strength. This atmosphere did not allow the League of Nations Assembly to refresh its spirit, to seek and plan as much as possible, to persevere without abandoning until it achieved a success. Therefore, the accomplishment of the League of Nations Assembly was decided before it was even discussed. "To speak to someone who cannot be spoken to is to waste words." China began with silence and ended with abstention. It was appropriate.

### League of Nations General Assembly Resolution: Declaring the Soviet Union's Departure and Condemning the Soviet Union's Breach of Covenant; Nine Countries Including China Abstain from Voting

The League of Nations General Assembly in Geneva continued its meeting this morning at 10:30 AM. First, the 1940 League of Nations budget was voted on and passed, with a total reduction of 33% compared to 1939. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Special Committee on the Finnish Question, Mr. Dama Tae, the representative of Portugal, announced the report and draft resolution submitted by the committee and delivered a speech on behalf of the Portuguese government, stating that the Portuguese government agreed with the proposal of the Argentine representative to declare the Soviet Union's departure from the League of Nations. "Since the Soviet Union has excluded itself from the League's covenant, it should be placed outside the League of Nations." At this point, the General Assembly submitted the Special Committee's report and draft resolution for a vote, which was passed with 31 votes in favor and 9 abstentions. Mr. Holtti, the representative of Finland, immediately expressed his gratitude to the representatives of various countries on behalf of the Finnish government. It is reported that a total of 40 national representatives attended this General Assembly. Among them, the representatives of nine countries, including the three Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden), the three Baltic states (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia), China, Switzerland, and Mexico, abstained from voting. The remaining 31 national representatives all voted in favor of declaring the Soviet Union's departure. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Geneva: After the League of Nations General Assembly passed the draft resolution submitted by the Special Committee, the Executive Council held a meeting at 4 PM today and passed a resolution declaring the Soviet Union's departure (in accordance with Article 16, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant, any member state that violates the Covenant shall be declared to be in violation by a unanimous resolution of all members of the Executive Council). (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Condemnation of the Soviet Union's Draft Resolution

Geneva: The Secretariat of the League of Nations issued a bulletin at 7:30 PM today, stating that "The Special Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly, which examined Argentina's proposal (i.e., the proposal to declare the Soviet Union's departure from the League of Nations), has drafted a report and decided to submit it to the General Assembly for discussion together with the draft resolution tomorrow. The draft resolution was unanimously adopted by all members of the Special Committee. Although the representatives of Sweden and Norway expressed their approval, they stated that they needed to consult their respective governments. The content is as follows: "The General Assembly of the League of Nations, in view of the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, has violated various agreements signed between the country and Finland, as well as Article 12 of the League of Nations Covenant and the Paris Peace Pact. Furthermore, in view of the fact that before the invasion, the country declared the abolition of the 1932 Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty without waiting for the expiration in 1945, it is hereby solemnly condemned, and the member states of the League of Nations are urgently requested to provide Finland with as much material assistance and humanitarian relief as possible. In addition, all actions that may weaken the country's resistance must be avoided as much as possible, and the General Assembly is authorized to instruct the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, together with the technical organs of the League of Nations, to organize assistance to Finland and to apply to non-member states for cooperation in accordance with the resolution passed on October 4, 1937 (i.e., the resolution on the Sino-Japanese dispute). This resolution was twice invited by the League of Nations to send representatives to attend the Executive Council and the General Assembly, but both were rejected, which shows that the country has despised the mission of the Executive Council to implement Article 15 of the Covenant, that is, to violate the extremely important goal of the League of Nations to ensure peace and the security of all countries, and that the Soviet Union has refused to attend the League of Nations on the pretext of having a relationship with the so-called People's Government of Finland. In fact, this pretext is unfounded, because this government, whether in law or in fact, is not recognized by the people of Finland. It can be seen that the Soviet Union not only violates the constraints of the League of Nations Covenant, but also excludes itself from the League's covenant." (Havas dispatch, 13th)

The Aid-Finland Movement Becomes More Concrete

Paris: The draft resolution submitted by the Special Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly has been commented on by political figures here, saying that when the Executive Council of the League of Nations discusses this draft resolution, since China and Latvia will both be outside the Executive Council, it will inevitably be unanimously passed, and the League of Nations' declaration of the Soviet Union's departure will probably be put into practice. As far as China and Latvia are concerned, both are quasi-permanent members of the Executive Council, and their terms have expired. Yesterday, the General Assembly of the League of Nations should have elected them for re-election, but in order to avoid causing difficulties for these countries regarding the Soviet Union (Latvia has a mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union, and China has received assistance from the Soviet Union), the General Assembly voted to elect three non-permanent members, and postponed the entry and exit of the two quasi-permanent members. Therefore, when the Executive Council meets tomorrow, China and Latvia will not participate in the meeting because they have not yet gone through the re-election procedures. In addition, the movement of various countries to aid Finland is becoming more concrete. The British government's approval of the transfer of aircraft to Finland is not accidental. The new cabinet of Sweden declared that it would provide Finland with material assistance, which can also be regarded as clear evidence. According to news from Geneva, if the League of Nations declares the Soviet Union's departure, the Soviet Union may sever diplomatic relations with the countries that voted in favor. Although this news has not been confirmed, it can be asserted that this session of the League of Nations will open an important era in the international situation. (13th, Havas)

### China and Turkey Elected as Quasi-Permanent Members of the League of Nations

Geneva: The terms of office of the current quasi-permanent and non-permanent members of the Executive Council of the League of Nations have expired in five countries. The General Assembly of the League of Nations re-elected three seats yesterday. There is still one quasi-permanent member seat left by China and one non-permanent member seat left by Latvia that have not been filled. When the General Assembly continued its meeting at 3:30 PM this afternoon, it elected China to continue as a quasi-permanent member with 34 votes against 3 votes, and elected Turkey as a non-permanent member with 37 votes against 0 votes, replacing Latvia. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Geneva: The League of Nations established two temporary council seats in the Executive Council three years ago, which were held by China and Latvia. The General Assembly of the League of Nations decided this morning to pass the recommendation of the General Committee to continue to maintain these two council seats, and the General Committee (organized by one chairman and eight vice-chairmen of the General Assembly) decided that China and Latvia should still maintain the temporary council seats, and for the sake of simplicity, it is not necessary to go through the voting process. It is expected that China and Latvia can be elected this afternoon. (13th, dispatch)

Geneva: Regarding the League of Nations' condemnation of the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland, China has now avoided a difficult responsibility. The election of China as a member of the Executive Council of the League of Nations has been postponed to the next meeting, so China has been spared the need to explain its position. However, China will feel embarrassed in view of its relations with the Soviet Union. (14th, Reuters dispatch)

Geneva: Mr. Butler, the chief British representative attending the League of Nations meeting, told the League of Nations General Assembly that the British delegation fully supported the report and resolution condemning the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland and requesting League of Nations members to do their best to assist Finland. He also said that although Britain and its allies are now engaged in a great struggle for justice and law, and are undertaking a great responsibility, the British government will not shirk its responsibility and will do its best to help Finland. The British government has taken several steps to enable Finland to obtain the war materials it needs for its national defense in Britain. (14th, Reuters dispatch)

Geneva: The Thirteen-Nation Committee is currently studying Bolivia's proposal, which includes three motions: (1) condemning the Soviet Union as an aggressor; (2) providing Finland with material assistance; (3) expelling the Soviet Union from membership. (14th, dispatch)

League of Nations Documents Delivered to the United States

Geneva: The Secretariat of the League of Nations yesterday sent all the notes and drafts regarding the discussion of the Soviet-Finnish conflict to the United States government, hoping that the United States would strive to find a peaceful solution. (14th, Haitong dispatch)

Soviet Union Criticizes League of Nations' Attitude

Moscow: The Soviet Union's radio station broadcasted last night, criticizing the League of Nations' attitude in handling the Finnish issue, stating that the real leaders of the League of Nations are Britain and France, who are trying to hide behind the scenes and appoint a special committee to handle the Finnish issue. Most of the representatives of the countries attending the committee also follow the claims of Britain and France, and nine of the thirteen representatives of the committee represent countries that do not have normal relations with the Soviet Union, and the policies they usually promote are also hostile to the Soviet Union. (14th, Haitong dispatch)

### British Prime Minister's Speech in the House of Commons: Decided to Assist Finland with All Efforts; Stated that the Soviet Union's Actions Insulted Justice; Highly Praised Finland's Resistance

London: When the House of Commons met this morning, Prime Minister Chamberlain attended and delivered a speech on the Finnish issue, stating, "The Finnish people's heroic resistance to defend their homeland is truly admirable. The country's army's combat capability should not be underestimated. The Soviet government's act of aggression is nothing less than an insult to justice in the world. Therefore, although the military strength of the Soviet Union and Finland is disparate, it is still difficult to predict the future of the war. As far as Germany is concerned, it openly supports the aggressor and fiercely criticizes the Scandinavian countries, blaming them for not helping Finland. It is not surprising that they are in cahoots with each other. As for the League of Nations General Assembly and the Executive Council's decision to deal with the Finnish issue, in my opinion, we should review the past facts. I still remember that when the League of Nations discussed the amendment to the Covenant last September, regarding the nature of the sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant, most of the representatives of various countries believed that each member state should decide according to its own position and mission. The British government has always believed that when an act of aggression occurs in a member state of the League of Nations, no country should turn a blind eye. Therefore, when Finland was invaded, Britain has transported many aircraft to the country and plans to provide other materials in the future. Now, German propaganda agencies are trying to use the Finnish issue to divert the efforts of Britain and France. They do not know that our first goal is to defeat Nazi Germany. We will not abandon this goal, nor will we forget that the Soviet Union's attack on Poland and Finland was the beginning of Germany's aggressive actions. From now on, we will do our best to help Finland, and at the same time, we will concentrate our efforts to resist Germany's aggression, as a fundamental solution. Only in this way can European countries hope to avoid catastrophe." (14th, Havas dispatch)

### Finnish Army Launches Counterattack in the Central Route; Intense Fighting in the Area of Haulvajarvi; Soviet Army Occupies Massali Island in Lake Ladoga

Finnish Capital: The Finnish army today launched its first major counterattack since the outbreak of the war, having crossed the border on the southern central front and advanced towards the Murmansk railway line. This railway line is the most important transportation line for the invading Red Army. (14th, United Press dispatch)

Swedish Capital: According to reports received here, Soviet and Finnish troops have been engaged in fierce fighting north of Lake Ladoga since yesterday afternoon. Both sides used heavy artillery to bombard each other, causing heavy casualties. The battle is taking place near Tolvajärvi, which is the decisive battle in the area. (14th, Haitong dispatch)

Finnish Capital: According to war reports from here, Soviet planes bombed Hango and Temisaari in the Gulf of Finland yesterday, with unknown losses. At the same time, Finnish reinforcements have rushed to the eastern and central fronts, as Soviet troops plan to attack there. According to Finnish military authorities, they have decided to prevent the Soviet army from advancing in the Gulf of Finland. They also stated that the reason for the Finnish army's withdrawal from the central front was to lure the Red Army away from its original position in order to facilitate the Finnish army's counterattack. The Finnish side said that the Soviet Union suffered heavy losses, but failed to announce the detailed loss figures. (14th, United Press dispatch)

Moscow: The Leningrad Military District issued the following report yesterday: "On December 13, the Soviet army continued to advance in the Ukhta area, reaching a line 105 kilometers away from the national border. In the Petrozavodsk area, they advanced along the railway from Pika-Ranta to Selsdao, occupying the town and station of Kitela. The air force was inactive due to bad weather." (14th, TASS dispatch)

Finnish Capital: Commander-in-Chief Du announced a war report stating that the Soviet Red Army launched a large-scale attack on the area of Haulvajarvi, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with our army. Our side has captured five tanks, four field guns, five anti-tank guns, and many automatic machine guns. The Red Army suffered heavy losses. There were also battles between the two sides near the Taipale River on the eastern front. The Red Army launched repeated attacks, but was repelled. As for the coastal area, the Kojesdu port battery has fired artillery to cover our army units in combat with the enemy, which has been quite successful. In addition, the Red Army has repeatedly attempted to land on the Lake Ladoga, but was repelled by our artillery. The few troops that have landed have also collapsed. Soviet planes have flown to Hango Island and other islands, dropping bombs. According to military observers, the Soviet Union's reckless attack, sacrificing soldiers and munitions, has resulted in more harm than good. For example, the country's cruisers "Marat" and "October Revolution" fired artillery at the Finnish Kojesdu port battery in dense fog on the 8th of this month, but all missed, killing only one Finnish soldier. Finland has also laid mines in various places to prevent the Red Army from advancing. When the Red Army advanced to the Vosky Bridge, it triggered landmines, causing heavy casualties. (14th, Havas dispatch)

Rome: According to a dispatch from the Finnish capital published here, the Soviet army has occupied Massali Island in Lake Ladoga, but the Soviet army has not made significant progress on the Karelia Line. The Finnish army is still guarding the Sumisaami area, 17 miles from the "wasp waist" border of Finland. The Soviet army has launched repeated attacks, but has been ineffective. The Soviet army is now trying desperately to advance to cut Finland in two and to block its transportation line to Sweden. (14th, Reuters dispatch)

London: British Air Force Minister Wood stated in the House of Commons last night that the government has decided to issue licenses to allow aircraft to be exported and transported to Finland. The audience applauded. However, Labor Party Member of Parliament Strauss said that aircraft are urgently needed by Britain in the current war, and it is unwise to supply them to others now. However, Wood did not agree with this view. Strauss also asked whether this move by Britain would drag Britain into another war. Wood did not answer this question. (14th, Reuters dispatch)

### British Cruiser Pursues German Pocket Battleship in the South Atlantic; Intense Fighting Between the Two Warships; German Warship Takes Refuge in Uruguayan Port

London: Three British cruisers and the German pocket battleship "Admiral Scheer" engaged in a naval battle in the South Atlantic yesterday. The Admiralty issued a bulletin stating that "Three British cruisers, namely the "Exeter," 8,300 tons (equipped with six 8-inch caliber guns), the "Ajax" (6,800 tons), and the "Achilles" (7,000 tons), under the command of Commander Harward, engaged the German pocket battleship "Admiral Scheer" (equipped with two 11-inch caliber guns) in a naval battle in the South Atlantic yesterday afternoon. The two sides opened fire and bombarded each other fiercely. The "Exeter" was damaged and immediately sailed elsewhere. The "Ajax" and "Achilles" continued to follow the enemy warship, opened fire, pursued and inflicted heavy damage. The enemy warship immediately took refuge in the Puerta River in Uruguay. The Plata River is located between Argentina and Uruguay, and the capitals of the two countries face each other across the river. The mouth of the river is 175 miles wide. (14th, Havas dispatch)

Berlin: The German High Command issued a statement on the encounter between the German warship "Admiral Spee" and the British warships "Exeter," "Ajax," and "Achilles," stating, "The "Admiral Spee" has been very active in the South Atlantic since the outbreak of the European war. Yesterday afternoon, the warship attacked the British ships "Tairoa" (7,983 tons) and "Streonshiel" (3,895 tons), which were sailing from Argentina to Europe, and sank them. The "Admiral Spee" then encountered the British heavy cruiser "Exeter" and the light cruisers "Ajax" and "Achilles." The "Exeter" was hit by several shells and immediately withdrew from the battle zone. One of the light cruisers was also severely damaged. The "Admiral Spee" was also hit by several shells and is now berthed in the harbor of the Uruguayan capital. According to news from the Uruguayan capital, the "Admiral Spee" is carrying 36 corpses and 60 wounded soldiers, but the damage is not serious and its combat power has not been lost. It is reported that the "Admiral Spee" is a 10,000-ton armored cruiser, launched in 1934. (14th, Haitong dispatch)

London: After three British cruisers and one German pocket battleship engaged in a naval battle in the South Atlantic yesterday, the Uruguayan authorities and the German Embassy in Uruguay confirmed that this pocket battleship was actually the "Admiral Graf Spee," not the "Admiral Scheer." People in the British Admiralty also stated that Germany has a total of three pocket battleships, namely the "Deutschland," the "Admiral Scheer," and the "Admiral Graf Spee." These warships are sister ships and have the same design. Even if they are very close to the ships, it is still difficult to distinguish them. It has been found that the "Admiral Graf Spee" has taken refuge within the territorial waters of Uruguay after being damaged. According to international law, the warship may anchor in the port of a neutral country, but once repairs are completed, it must leave within 24 hours. During the repair period, it may not add weapons to increase its combat power. British warships also have the right to monitor outside the territorial waters of neutral countries so that they can intercept the warship when it sails out. (14th, Havas dispatch)

Uruguayan Capital: When the German pocket battleship "Admiral Spee" arrived here, it had captured six British merchant ship captains and treated them as prisoners of war. (14th, Haitong dispatch)

Uruguayan Capital: According to claims here, the German warship that encountered the British cruiser fleet at the mouth of the La Plata River was the battleship "Admiral Spee," not the "Admiral Scheer." (14th, Haitong dispatch)

London: After Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons this morning on the Finnish issue, he submitted a report on the situation of the naval battle between British and German warships in the South Atlantic, stating that at about 6:00 a.m. yesterday, the British cruiser "Ajax" encountered a German pocket battleship in the South Atlantic and immediately joined forces with the British cruisers "Exeter" and "Achilles" to fight the enemy warship. As a result, the enemy warship has fled to the port of Montevideo, Uruguay. (The parliamentarians applauded.) The battle at that time was very intense. Our cruiser "Exeter" reduced its speed and withdrew from the battle circle after being damaged, but the other two smaller cruisers continued to bravely chase after it. (The parliamentarians applauded.) By midnight yesterday, we had identified the enemy warship as the "Admiral Graf Spee," equipped with six 11-inch light guns. Unable to withstand our pressure, it finally fled into the territorial waters of a neutral country. According to the report from the German Ambassador to Uruguay, 36 officers and soldiers of the enemy warship have died and 60 have been injured, and falsely claimed that this was due to the British warships using mustard gas shells. (The parliamentarians laughed.) However, the British Navy has never manufactured or used mustard gas shells or bombs. This kind of report is arbitrarily fabricated and not worth refuting. As of now, although the government has not received a detailed report on this naval battle, I believe that the three smaller British warships were able to fight an enemy warship with far greater firepower, which is a very heroic act. From now on, the South Atlantic may be free from the threat of this pirate ship. It can be seen that the British warships' efforts in this battle were of great merit." (14th, Havas)

London: The Admiralty announced that a British submarine, which sighted the German mail ship "Bremen" on December 12, has sunk one German submarine and one cruiser in the North Sea. The British ship "Di Pu Te Fu Te" (4,083 tons) was hit by a torpedo fired by a German submarine in Norwegian territorial waters yesterday. This is the third German violation of Norwegian territorial waters in recent days. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### The Escape of the Bremen

Bremen: After the German mail ship "Bremen" returned to a German port, crew members released a report on the failed attack by a British submarine, stating, more or less, that the sea was calm at the time. Lookouts were watching around the ship, and aircraft were providing aerial protection. Suddenly, the aircraft signaled that a submarine had been spotted. The entire ship was immediately put on alert, and the order was given to "Increase speed and proceed in a zigzag course." The aircraft also flew to the location of the submarine. The atmosphere was extremely tense, but just as the aircraft was about to attack, the submarine had already submerged and escaped. The entire ship remained on alert, and the aircraft continued to scout around for the submarine. Finally, the aircraft signaled that the submarine had already fled far away, and the ship returned to its normal state. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

### British Light Destroyer Sunk in Collision

London: The British light destroyer "Duchess," of 1,375 tons, sank after colliding with another British ship. Only one officer and twenty-two ordinary soldiers were rescued.

Swiss Capital: The German semi-official news agency, the German News Agency, issued a war bulletin from the German General Headquarters stating that patrol and artillery units from both sides were quite active in various locations on the front line last night. A German patrol unit, consisting of one officer and ten soldiers, engaged in a battle with French troops southwest of Saarbrücken, occupying a French outpost, killing five sentries, and capturing sixteen. In addition, several British aircraft flew to Heligoland to drop bombs. They were immediately fired upon by anti-aircraft artillery on the island and warships, and the enemy aircraft were driven away before they reached the North Sea coast. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### British Air Force Intercepts Mining Aircraft

London: The British Air Ministry issued a statement last night disclosing the British Air Force's interception of German mining aircraft, stating that the British Air Force has implemented aerial patrols over German maritime aircraft bases, such as the islands of Pigen and Norderney, to intercept the activities of mining aircraft emerging from these bases. Despite fierce anti-aircraft fire, the British aircraft's patrol operations have been effectively implemented. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

London: It is reported that the security patrols against German mining aircraft are all conducted by British bombers with long endurance and strong armaments. If German aircraft are encountered over Heligoland, it will not be difficult to repel them. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Germany Denies Seeking Peace

Berlin: Regarding foreign news agencies' reports that Germany is currently striving for peace, willing to restore the independence of certain parts of Poland and Czechoslovakia, and hold a plebiscite in Austria, the Nazi Party's organ, the "Financial Newspaper," commented in an article titled "Product of Fear." The newspaper questioned what the recent news was: Wasn't it the loss of British ships, the reduction of British exports, the insufficiency of British imports, the increase in British unemployment to 1.4 million, and the reiteration of the Axis policy by Italy, and two protests to England from Soviet Russia? These are all facts preventing Germany from seeking peace. If people in London hope that Germany will make peace proposals, then they will likely wait in vain, as the last of these proposals has already been made. Now, only weapons can speak. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

### Two British Parliamentarians Advocate Peace with Germany, Refuted by Our Prime Minister

London: Two members of the House of Lords requested the British government last night to immediately accept peace talks and denounced the idea of fighting to the end. British Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately refuted the two, pointing out that such arguments would hinder the implementation of British national policy. Halifax also said, "The British government is deeply aware of the difficulties of negotiating peace after a prolonged war, but if peace is hastily made with Germany, it will be misunderstood by Germany. If that happens, the difficulties caused will inevitably be even greater than negotiating peace after a prolonged war." (United Press dispatch, 14th)

### Soviet "Pravda" Comments on Economic Warfare: Balkan Countries Severely Affected

Moscow: "Pravda" recently published an article titled "Economic Warfare and the Balkan Countries," stating, "The foreign trade, foreign raw material imports, and commodities of the Balkan countries have recently experienced serious difficulties. Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Greece have recently implemented strict controls on foreign trade. The prices of various necessities in Romania have skyrocketed, and speculation and hoarding have become very common. Yugoslavia is experiencing a severe shortage of raw materials, especially the textile industry, which needs foreign cotton, and many textile factories are about to be forced to shut down. Prices are also rising sharply. Bulgaria is also severely affected by the naval blockade. Only a few neutral ships are currently visiting the country's seaports, and its railway traffic has been reduced due to a lack of fuel. The Bulgarian government has taken various emergency economic measures due to the war and counter-sales. The above facts consistently demonstrate that the war and Britain's violation of international law have severely damaged the economic life of the Balkan countries." (TASS dispatch, 14th)

### Swedish New Cabinet Issues Declaration

Swedish Capital: The Swedish new cabinet, formed by Hansson, issued a declaration last night outlining its policies, stating that Sweden will maintain its independence and neutrality and cooperate with other countries not bound by alliances to maintain the common interests of neutral countries, expand cooperation among Nordic countries, and that the Swedish government sympathizes with the general desire to provide humanitarian material assistance to Finland.

### Riots in Central India

Rome: According to the "Fascist System Report," riots in the Yu Bo Er Bo Er area of Central India, caused by the killing of sacred cows, resulted in 150 deaths and injuries. According to the British, the sacred cows were killed by Muslims, but local natives accused the British authorities, believing that the British killed the sacred cows to prevent Muslims and Hindus from reaching an agreement. Muslims and Hindus protested against the British authorities, leading to British police firing, according to Italian newspapers. Yu Bo Er Bo Er has now declared martial law, and the British have dispatched troops to reinforce the area. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

### China Made Great Progress During the War: Observations by British Writer Tawney

London: Writer and economic expert Tawney, speaking at a meeting of the China Aid Committee, said that although China has suffered losses in terms of life and economy, this war has helped solve the difficulties encountered by the Chinese government. In the past two years, the war has promoted China's unification more effectively than in the previous twenty years, and the government's forced relocation to the west has made the Chinese people more aware of the rich mineral and agricultural resources of the interior. China's permanent problem is not the industrial worker problem, but the peasant problem. In the past twenty years, the plight of the peasants has worsened day by day. If this is not changed, China will continue to degenerate fundamentally, as the peasants have suffered from floods, and farming methods have not been improved, and vendors, usurers, and petty tax officials have exploited them. In his opinion, China's development should not adopt the industrial system of the United States or Germany, but should follow France's focus on the happiness of the peasants. Therefore, the main task of China after the war is to organize its economic and political systems, while maintaining its original and admirable virtues. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Three Factors in Resolving the Sino-Japanese War: Yarnall's Opinion

New York: Former Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Yarnall, recently gave a speech at the Student Union here, saying that "If a solution to the Sino-Japanese war is to be found in the future, it must include the following three important factors: (1) a strong and independent China; (2) the Japanese army and navy should be subject to the control of the Japanese cabinet; (3) Guarantee that Japanese goods will not be subject to discriminatory treatment in peacetime, and guarantee that the country can freely obtain various raw materials." (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### German-Japanese Negotiations: Cargo Losses

Tokyo: The Osaka office of the Japanese Trade Bureau received a telegram from Rome yesterday stating that German ships carrying cargo to Japan, which are currently sheltering in Italian ports, are requesting cargo owners to bear part of the cost of sheltering during the sheltering period, up to 20% of the cargo price. The German shipowners' justification is that the cost of sheltering ships is gradually increasing, and this cost should be included in the common loss item. However, Japanese merchants feel that the 20% of the cargo price demanded by the Germans is too high and unreasonable. They now hope that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will begin negotiations with Germany to reach a more reasonable solution. According to some sources, a subsidy of 5% would be appropriate. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Soviet Ship Sinks After Hitting Reef, Many Rescued in Snowstorm, Half of Crew Missing

Tokyo: As a result of the Soviet ship "Indigirka" (2,336 tons) running aground off the coast of Japan, it is known that 87 people have died. The ship had about 1,000 passengers and crew members. 399 people have been rescued, and the rest are missing. However, it is believed that 200 people are still alive. Several Japanese ships are currently docking near the accident site, but turbulent seas are hindering rescue efforts. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Tokyo: According to news from Hokkaido, the Soviet ship "Indigirka," weighing 2,336 tons, carrying 1,139 people from the Kamchatka fishing grounds to Vladivostok, encountered a storm on Tuesday morning and hit a reef in the Soya Strait. The port side was shattered, and seawater flooded in. The first mate and nine crew members escaped to shore in a lifeboat, but due to dangerous waves, it immediately capsized. Another lifeboat was launched, but four of the crew members were swept away by huge waves, and four others were also washed into the sea. The remaining two finally reached the coast and were rescued by the Japanese authorities. Several Japanese small boats sailed to the accident site, but due to the heavy winds and waves, they could not approach. Two-thirds of the Soviet ship had sunk into the water. Hundreds of people could be seen standing on the deck in the snowstorm, begging for rescue. However, rescuers were ultimately blocked by the turbulent waves. Later, several ships arrived and bravely went forward despite the wind and snow, rescuing 395 people and recovering seven people from the sea. Within four miles of the coast near the site of the Soviet ship accident, 180 corpses of men, women, and children were found. 557 people are still missing, presumably all buried at the bottom of the sea. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### U.S.-Japan Trade Relations: Future Still Uncertain, Hull Unwilling to State Position

Washington: The Secretary of State refused to comment yesterday on reports that the U.S.-Japan talks currently being held in Tokyo are related to the conclusion of a new U.S.-Japan trade treaty. However, Hull indicated that the talks may discuss the trade relations between the U.S. and Japan after the U.S.-Japan trade treaty expires on January 26 of next year. Hull's remarks were made in response to reporters' questions. Hull did not offer his opinion voluntarily. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

Washington: Although the European situation is very serious, U.S. political circles are still paying close attention to the Far Eastern problem. All sectors are paying close attention to the actions the government will take after the U.S.-Japan trade treaty expires on January 26 of next year. It is believed that the government will use economic weapons to sanction Japan and stop trade with Japan. Since U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew's speech mentioned the increasing anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States, all sectors have paid more attention to the Far Eastern problem. Assistant Secretary of State Messersmith followed up with a speech in Boston, stating that Japan's actions in the Far East have damaged the U.S. position in the Nine-Power Treaty, but this does not mean that the United States will stay out of the matter. The United States still hopes to work with all countries related to the Far East to find a solution that is in accordance with international law. Members of Congress no longer value trade with Japan. According to experts, the explanation for this may be found in the situation of Japanese goods in the United States. Although there are restrictions such as tariffs on Japanese goods imported into the United States, the prices are still lower than American goods, causing complaints from American manufacturers. However, this matter may be slightly obstructed in Congress, because isolationist stalwart Bora still supports the conclusion of a new U.S.-Japan trade treaty and wants to downsize the China incident. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Beijing: Special Envoy Kato stated here today that the Japan-Soviet trade treaty cannot actually replace the Japan-U.S. trade treaty, "because Japan cannot buy cotton from the Soviet Union, and Soviet women do not want to buy silk stockings from Japan." Regarding his meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Johnson, Kato stated that he was not prepared to meet with him, and even if he did, he would not discuss the relationship between the United States and Japan. When asked about the various restrictions and controls imposed by Japan in China and the lifting of the Tianjin blockade, Kato stated, "I cannot say when the various control measures implemented in China for military reasons can be lifted." Finally, Kato stated that although Japan hopes to establish a new trade treaty with the United States, it is also prepared for the U.S.-Japan trade treaty not to continue. As for Japan's attitude towards the Soviet Union, it is also extremely cautious. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

### French Chamber of Deputies Discusses Budget, Finance Minister Reynaud Speaks

Paris: The Chamber of Deputies yesterday submitted the budget for the next year for discussion. Finance Minister Reynaud made a speech to explain it. He said, "Although military action has only just begun, the currency war has already reached its most serious stage. As far as France is concerned, all our economic and financial arrangements are very sound, but there are still things that must be understood, namely, raising wages, wasting labor, and refusing to increase taxes can all fatally damage our currency. We must increase production and reduce consumption in this extraordinary period. The goal of the government's current policy is to prevent prices from rising and to increase the value of the franc. Therefore, the steps the government plans to take are nothing more than (1) direct control of prices, (2) cracking down on speculation, (3) universal austerity, (4) stabilizing wage levels, (5) controlling exchange rates, and (6) encouraging exports to earn more foreign currency. All of this will inevitably require some sacrifice from the people, but it is not comparable to the harsh methods adopted by Germany, such as issuing fines to all necessary industrial centers and forcing the Germanic minorities residing in various countries to return home to seize all their foreign currency. As for the French Exchange Equalization Fund, since the beginning of the war, although the government has purchased a large number of goods abroad, the operation of this fund is still very smooth. This is all due to the large amount of funds stored abroad flowing back to our country. In the ten months before the outbreak of the war, no less than 26,000,000,000 francs of gold flowed back to our country from abroad. By this time, the gold reserves of the Bank of France have increased by 60,000,000,000 francs compared to before. As for the recent financial cooperation agreement signed between Britain and France, it is beneficial to both parties, and the determination of both countries to fight to the end can also be clearly demonstrated. In short, our responsibility lies in preparing for a long-term war. German leader Hitler is currently hoping that internal turmoil will occur in our country, but this is a dream that will not be realized. In fact, we are in control of everything, and our country's parliament can freely accept all measures that are necessary to promote policies. This is the difference between us and Germany. I am confident that we will prevail, but in order to achieve this goal, we must first restrain ourselves." (Havas, 14th)

### Joint Meeting of British and French Trade Unions Held in Paris

Paris: Seven representatives from the British Trades Union Congress, led by the chairman of the Congress, Sir Walter Citrine, have arrived here and held a joint meeting with seven representatives from the French General Confederation of Labour at 10:30 a.m. The French delegation was led by General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour, Stonehouse.

### France Continues to Supply Automobiles to China

Chongqing: The 500 trucks and buses ordered by the Chinese Ministry of Communications from the French Renault Company last year, although France urgently needs them itself due to the outbreak of the European war, will be delivered without problems, according to the French here today. Part of them has already been delivered to China, and the undelivered part will not be difficult to deliver soon. It is said that of these 500 vehicles, 400 are ordinary cargo trucks, and the remaining 100 are buses that can carry both passengers and cargo. However, whether they are used for cargo or passengers, each vehicle is three tons and can use crude oil, tung oil, and vegetable oil as fuel. As for the area where these vehicles will operate, it will be on the newly completed Sichuan-Yunnan Highway. The road starts from Luzhou in Sichuan and ends in Kunming in Yunnan, with a total length of 650 miles, making it the shortest route between Sichuan and Yunnan. The construction cost of the entire line reached 500,000 US dollars, and those who built the road were mostly volunteer work teams. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

### Construction of the Maginot Line: A Masterpiece of French Engineering, Total Length Exceeds 300 Kilometers

(Paris Airmail Correspondence) After the end of the last European war, although Germany had been disarmed according to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, French intellectuals, looking to the future, all believed that apart from the Rhine River separating a quarter of the French-German border, the rest had no natural barriers. Therefore, Prime Minister Aristide Briand and then Minister of War André Maginot decided to design and build the "Shield of France" in this vast border area and in the area bordering Belgium. This is the world's longest and greatest "Maginot Line."

This defense line can also be called a masterpiece of French engineering. Examining its design, it completely abandoned the construction methods of previous fortifications and adopted a revolutionary principle. Closely following the terrain of the border, countless bunkers were carefully built, intermittent but continuous, extending for more than 300 kilometers, and mostly hidden underground, making them unbreakable. This defense line is also similar to a naval fleet, with its outposts being destroyers, its gun emplacements being cruisers, and its reinforced concrete heavy gun emplacements being battleships. In short, various weapons and military knowledge of the 20th century have been integrated into one, making it difficult for any strong enemy to cross.

The initial construction cost of the Maginot Line was first designated as a special fund in the 1925 budget proposal. When the parliament discussed this proposal at that time, there was a heated debate before it was passed. However, the project was huge and costly. In 1927, an additional 375,000,000 francs was approved. In early 1929, another 375,000,000 francs was allocated. In December of the same year, another 3,750,000,000 francs were added. In 1934, another 3,000,000,000 francs were added. It was not until last year that it was fully completed. The person in charge of the project was the Director-General of Engineering, Mr. Belhague, whose contribution is truly unforgettable. As for the structure of the Maginot Line, all the outer walls are made of reinforced concrete, up to three meters thick, which cannot be broken by any heavy artillery. The interior has seven floors. The top floor is an observation post, followed by a guard room, then a light ammunition depot, then barracks, then a transportation floor with light railways, then a machine room equipped with electric generators and air conditioners to ensure hygiene and prevent the spread of poison gas when necessary. The bottom floor is a vehicle ammunition depot. Telephones are installed between the gun emplacements to communicate information. All equipment used is made of steel to prevent combustion. The outposts are equipped with direct-fire artillery positions, machine gun positions, and wide trenches to prevent enemy tanks. There are also light artillery positions. Behind the sentries are water storage tanks, food warehouses, hospitals, and special communication trenches to allow frontline soldiers to retreat in an orderly manner when necessary. As for air defense equipment, it is also readily available. According to French engineers, a 110-pound bomb dropped from a height of 1,000 meters can penetrate reinforced concrete structures up to 20 inches thick. An 1,100-pound bomb can penetrate only 21 inches, while a 2,200-pound bomb can penetrate 43 inches. As for the defending soldiers, they are all well-trained elite troops. Once the mobilization order is issued, they can quickly arrive at the designated defense area and achieve maximum effectiveness in defense in an instant. (Havas)

### Purpose of Japanese Army's Invasion of Zhao'an: Lin Zhiyuan as Guide for Japanese-Puppet Army, Chinese Army Clears Fields on Fujian-Guangdong Border

Shantou Correspondence: The invasion of Zhao'an by the puppet army Huang Dawei is the initial plan of the Japanese army to launch disturbances in Fujian. Lin Zhiyuan, former Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Fujian Province, serves as the "Senior Advisor to the Commander-in-Chief of the Peace and Pacification Army" of the puppet regime, acting as a guide for the puppet army. Zhao'an is a first-class county in Fujian Province, rich in agricultural products, especially peanut oil and sugar cane. In the mountain villages in the four suburbs, there are still poppy flowers. Near the sea, there are also benefits from fishing and salt. Tens of thousands of people go to Nanyang every year via Shantou, taking ships to go abroad. There are many wealthy people in the countryside, and education is developed. The villages are organized with baojia system, and the order is good. Compared with the neighboring Raoping County, there is a world of difference. The purpose of the Japanese army's invasion of Zhao'an is, politically, to break the stable environment, making the hometown of overseas Chinese in southern Fujian suffer first, shaking the hearts of overseas Chinese; economically, to absorb agricultural products to alleviate the food shortage in the occupied areas of Chaozhou and Shantou, and to exchange military tickets for huge amounts of foreign exchange every year, implementing the vicious plan of supporting the war with war; and militarily, to break through the outer anti-blockade of Chaozhou and Shantou, attempting to use a small number of troops to attract the main force of the Chinese army to the Guangdong-Fujian border, and then launch a major battle towards the northwest of Guangdong Province and the Yongning area.

It is found that the loss of Huanggang, Zhelin, Jingzhou, and three other places on the Guangdong border on November 30 was entirely due to the flanking attacks from the sea by Japanese warships. On December 1, the Chinese army Wu Qiwel's troops arrived and recovered Huanggang and Xiaodong, and increased troops to garrison Fenshuiling. The ridge is the only passage for automobiles on the Huang-Zhao Road, 25 li east of Zhao'an City and 18 li west of Huanggang City. The mountain range extends from north to south, reaching the sea at Zhelindacheng. On the 2nd, the Japanese and puppet troops firmly defended the small islands of Zhelin Bay, Haishan, and Hongmen. However, after their vanguard was defeated under Fenshuiling on the 30th, another route crossed the ridge into Gongkou and Songbaishan in Zhao'an, engaging in fierce battles with the local militia. Japanese warships also sent boats to the vicinity of Tongshan Island to launch a sneak attack by landing on Yunxiao. Zhao'an City fell into a three-sided encirclement. On the night of the 1st, the defending troops began to withdraw into the mountains to the north. On the 2nd, 700 troops of the puppet army Wang Tiancal's unit entered the city and defended the Dongxi Bridge. The Japanese army defended the airfield eight li away from the city. All the important passes in the suburbs have been occupied by the Japanese artillery. Lin Zhiyuan's announcement appeared in Zhao'an City on the 3rd. Fenshuiguan and the mountains on the Fujian-Guangdong border are still defended by the Chinese army. On the 4th, the highway line from Zhao'an to Chenghai was suddenly recovered, shattering the Japanese army's plan to open up Fujian and Guangdong. On the 5th, battles continued to occur in Zhao'an City, Jianshan, Fuxi, Songbaishan, Fenshuiguan, Huanggang, Qian'dong, Huaizhai, Jiuxiqiao, Zhanglin, and Sunan. The Chinese army temporarily took a defensive posture, while the Japanese and puppet troops took an offensive posture with the assistance of Japanese warships and aircraft. However, the coastal area is narrow, and the Japanese army is confined to Tuolin, Haishan Island, Xunmian Island, Hongmen, Jingzhou, and Yanzao, and has been unable to develop. The Chinese army is now implementing a policy of clearing the fields. All the people in the villages within ten li of Zhangdong Road, Zhangqian Road, Qianhuang Road, Huangzhao Road, and Qianrao Road are retreating to Raoping, Shangrao, Dapu, and Pinghe. Transportation tools, such as rickshaws, bicycles, and small boats, that cannot be taken away are burned. Cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, and livestock must be taken along. Those who remain behind are allowed to be slaughtered and eaten. Grains are stored in designated guerrilla bases, and receipts are issued. Villagers can borrow rice from charity granaries with the receipts. Stoves, bowls, dishes, and tables must be destroyed and not left behind. Houses must be burned down when necessary. The field-clearing movement is now very strict, ensuring that all supplies used by the Japanese and puppet troops must be transported from the rear and cannot be requisitioned locally.

### Southeast Township of Jiangyin Once Bombed, Rice Transport Out of Villages Prohibited

Changyinsha Correspondence: Yangku, Zhouzhuang, Huashi, Houcheng, and other towns in the southeast township were heavily harassed by the Japanese army on the 16th and 17th of last month. Small bombs were dropped from seaplanes to intimidate the villagers. Dozens of villagers were injured at that time, mostly children and women. After the Chang army withdrew, the order in the southeast township gradually recovered. The transportation of rice in the villages is strictly prohibited. Even a few dan of rice transported from Town A to Town B must have proof documents. Furthermore, the ×× Battlefield Service Corps is most active in inspection. The price of rice in the villages is 16 yuan per dan, using old measures; soybean oil is 1 yuan per jin; pork is 1 yuan per jin; firewood is 1 yuan per hundred jin. Daily necessities have soared in price. The export of local products is subject to tax according to regulations, but rice stones are absolutely prohibited. If private narratives are discovered, they will be executed immediately. Public money is scarce in the villages. The Chamber of Commerce of the Third District of Jiangyin County (including Houcheng towns) has issued substitute coupons, divided into 1 fen, 2 fen, and 5 fen denominations, which are commonly used in various villages. The purpose of its issuance is to manage comprehensively and avoid problems caused by the lack of copper coins and the indiscriminate issuance of local chips and substitute coupons in various places. Once the National Bank has a solution for copper coins and small change, it will issue a notice to recall and abolish them. Auxiliary currency coupons of one or two jiao and one-yuan coupons are also very scarce.

### Financial Revenue Plan of Fujian Province: Expanding Provincial Enterprises, Reorganizing Various Taxes, Implementing Public Treasury System

Fuzhou Correspondence: The finances of Fujian Province were already in deficit in peacetime. Since May of this year, after the seaports were blockaded, foreign trade stagnated, tax revenue fell short, and the deficit deepened. The monthly average shortfall is more than 500,000 yuan. Therefore, the authorities have been striving to reorganize finances for several months. However, the reorganization policy is nothing more than two aspects: increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. In terms of reducing expenditure, Fujian Province has successively abolished all redundant institutions since the start of the war. Now, there is nothing left to abolish. The salaries of civil servants have also been discounted twice. Currently, except for salaries below 40 yuan, senior-level salaries are only 50%, mid-level salaries are only 60%, and lower-level salaries are only 70%. At a time when prices are soaring, the salaries currently paid to civil servants can only maintain a minimum standard of living and really cannot be reduced any further. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on increasing revenue. There are currently three methods planned by the authorities to increase revenue. The first is to expand provincial enterprises, that is, to expand the scope of business of trading companies, transportation companies, provincial banks, provincial factories (five have already been established), and provincial agricultural fields to seek profits and increase compensation for the provincial treasury shortfall. In recent months, it has gradually become effective, and it is expected that there will be even better results in the coming year. The second is to reorganize various taxes, which can be handled in two parts. A. Regarding the ordinary business tax, because the tax amount is still based on the 25th year, it is not suitable for the current business situation. Therefore, a general survey of the ordinary business tax throughout the province has been held since November, presided over by personnel dispatched by the Department of Finance or handled by the county government itself. All are limited to be completed by the end of January of the 29th year in order to redetermine the tax amount to achieve an average burden. B. Regarding the special business tax, because the prices of goods in Fujian Province have been rising with each passing day since the War of Resistance, with some increasing by two or three times and others increasing by five or six times, the original commodity prices of special business taxes should be re-surveyed to modify the tax rate to make it reasonable. This modification will be based on the principle of importing goods first, then exporting goods, and non-essential goods first, then essential goods, so as not to affect the sales of local products and the people's livelihood while increasing tax revenue. The third is to implement a public treasury system. Public treasuries will be established in each county, and procedures for the receipt and expenditure of provincial and county public funds will be established so that all public property will be concentrated in the public treasury, separating the administrative system from the cashier system to avoid confusion. Implement unified receipt and expenditure. The competent financial authorities can examine the urgency of expenditures, coordinate and allocate them, and enable the receipt of public funds to be quickly deposited in the treasury and the payment of funds to be protected against false expenditures. As for the budget of Fujian Province for the 29th year, it has generally been drafted. The funding for each part is saved as much as possible according to actual needs. The security funding is maintained at the original amount. The administrative funding is slightly tightened. The education funding, construction funding, and health funding have all been increased.

Education News

### Ministry of Education Unifies University Textbooks, Begins Writing and Plans to Divide into Three Categories

(Chongqing, 14th dispatch) The university curriculum in our country has never had unified regulations. The courses offered by each school inevitably differ, and the level of teaching materials is even more uneven. The Ministry of Education, in view of this, in addition to having successively promulgated the common compulsory course schedule for each academy and the compulsory and elective course schedule for each department, has recently begun to write university textbooks. The content is planned to be divided into three categories: Category A is the textbook for common compulsory courses in the academy, Category B is the textbook or reference book for compulsory courses in each department, and Category C is general reading material for university students. The method of collecting manuscripts is planned to be divided into three types: special writing, soliciting manuscripts, and evaluating excellent books that have been published. The Ministry of Education has recently ordered the National Compilation and Translation Hall to prepare a plan and candidates for writers and submit them for approval. All types of manuscripts must be approved by the Academic Advisory Committee of the Ministry before they can be published. The standard for manuscript fees is approximately 10 yuan per thousand words.

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the ministry has intensified mass training to meet the needs and shortened the teaching period of People's Schools to two months. At the same time, it compiled two volumes of People's School textbooks, Type B, for teaching purposes. Since its implementation, it has been quite suitable for the curriculum standards of People's Schools promulgated by the ministry. Now, in order to implement continuing education for graduates of People's Schools, the ministry has compiled four volumes of Advanced People's School textbooks, which have been published and distributed to the education departments of various provinces, totaling more than 10,000 copies, for reprinting and distribution.

### Japanese Nationals Assault British Sergeant - Three Japanese Arrested, Handed Over to Japanese Consulate Yesterday - Sergeant Recovering from Abdominal Injuries

Three Japanese import and export merchants were arrested at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road at 7:30 PM the night before last for assaulting British Sergeant King. The Japanese Consulate General was notified around 8:00 PM, but the Japanese authorities did not claim them that night. A Dazhong News reporter learned yesterday that the three Japanese nationals were handed over to the police of the Japanese Consulate yesterday morning and charged with assaulting a public official. King's injuries from the assault are said to be recovering. According to reports, King, dressed in plain clothes and accompanied by a Chinese constable, was driving away prostitutes from the street corner and arresting several at the aforementioned location. Five Japanese nationals happened to pass by and strongly demanded that King release the arrested prostitutes. When King refused, an argument ensued. After 15 minutes, four of the Japanese nationals began to punch and kick King, injuring his abdomen. Another attempted to dissuade his companions from doing so, but to no avail.

The four Japanese nationals who committed the assault then attempted to drag Western Sergeant King into a car they had hired from Hongkou parked by the side of the road, intending to take him to Hongkou. Fortunately, Stevens, a soldier from the West Fords Highlands regiment, and Macneill, an inspector from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Works Department, happened to pass by and intervened, rescuing King from the four angry Japanese nationals. At this time, detectives arrived from all directions, but one of the Japanese nationals who committed the assault escaped. The remaining four were arrested, but one of them did not participate in the assault and even tried to stop it. After King explained this, he was released.

Report in the North-China Daily News on the Incident

The North-China Daily News reported that King, a Canadian constable from the Shanghai Municipal Police's Laoza Police Station, was seriously beaten by six or seven Japanese nationals while on duty on Nanjing Road last night (the 13th), suffering concussions and severe bruising. His thumb may be fractured, and he is currently in the Hong'en Hospital for treatment.

Obstructing Prostitutes While on Duty

At the time of the incident, King was in plain clothes, holding the prostitutes at the street corner to await the arrival of the police vehicle dispatched from the police station. This was one of King's routine duties, as he was ordered to suppress the large number of prostitutes gathered in the area.

Six or Seven Japanese Nationals Suddenly Assaulted Him

While King was waiting for the vehicle, six or seven Japanese nationals suddenly arrived at the scene. These individuals, possibly having arrived nearby in a car and then disembarked, pushed King aside without asking questions. When King tried to disperse these Japanese nationals, he was surrounded and beaten by several of them. After knocking King to the ground, the Japanese nationals attempted to drag him into a car, claiming they would take him to Hongkou.

The Assailants Were Arrested and Handed Over to the Japanese Consulate

Fortunately, several foreigners arrived at the scene and intervened. After a while, the police vehicle arrived and arrested four Japanese nationals. The remaining Japanese nationals escaped. After arriving at the police station, King identified the three Japanese nationals who had committed the assault. The police then handed over the Japanese nationals to the police department of the Japanese Consulate. According to King, one of the four Japanese nationals had tried to stop the others and helped him protect himself from being beaten.

### Decision Reached Through Consultation Between Two Settlements - Warning Issued to Six Rice Merchants - More Rice Stores Will Be Summoned - People Seen Initiating Food Seizures

Since the authorities of the two settlements resolutely implemented measures to crack down on unscrupulous merchants hoarding rice, significant results have been achieved. Xu, the owner of a rice store on Avenue Joffre, was summoned the day before yesterday and remains detained in the police station, not yet released. In general, hoarders have begun to restrain themselves slightly. It is reported that representatives of the two settlements authorities met yesterday afternoon to discuss specific measures to deal with hoarders. In addition, they decided to send letters severely warning six rice merchants, including a Mr. So-and-so. If they do not reform, they will be severely punished. It is also reported that several other rice stores are suspected of hoarding and will be summoned by the police.

Do Not Hoard Grain to Avoid Accidents

The night before last, the San Tai Flour Company at 239 Rue Massenet in the French Concession was robbed by more than 100 people, resulting in the theft of 32 bags of flour, with losses reaching over 200 yuan. The Rice Merchants Association has scheduled a committee meeting to urge its members to abide by price controls and avoid hoarding large quantities to prevent accidents.

Sincerely Urging Hoarders to Repent and Renew Themselves

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' United Association, in order to suppress rice prices and maintain the food supply for the people, has issued a public notice to the citizens, stating: "Our citizens, the soaring rice prices in Shanghai have created an unprecedented record. The entire Shanghai society has fallen into a state of panic. Food is the paramount necessity of the people. If this abnormal situation is not corrected by the public's collective strength, the future is unimaginable. We believe that the biggest reason for the rising rice prices in Shanghai is the hoarding and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. The authorities of the two settlements have jointly issued a notice declaring that they will not protect merchants who manipulate rice and will even expel them from the country. It can be seen that the time for unscrupulous merchants to repent and renew themselves is imminent. We sincerely hope that they will immediately ignite their conscience, quickly release the hoarded rice, and return rice prices to normal. Otherwise, if they remain obstinate, the law is in place, and public opinion will not tolerate it. There will be no good outcome. At the same time, we hope that those with relatively ample household finances will not purchase large quantities of rice for household use, leaving some for the ordinary people to buy, so as not to stimulate rice prices to rise. In order to suppress rice prices in Shanghai, in addition to urging the settlement authorities to find ways to dredge sources of supply and revise lower price limits, we will also unite with various public organizations to strive for the implementation of necessary measures such as group purchases of rice. We hope that our citizens, if they know of any unscrupulous merchants hoarding, speculating, or monopolizing rice, will report them as much as possible in accordance with the notices of the two settlement authorities, so that unscrupulous merchants have no way to use their tricks, and the rice problem is resolved early, without reverting to exhaustion. We hope you will take note of this."

Authorities' Measures Show Initial Results

Since the two settlements issued notices to crack down on speculators, manipulators, and merchants who monopolize rice, and various important public organizations issued earnest exhortations not to engage in speculative transactions, the entire rice market has turned to ease, and rice prices have gradually fallen back. The current price of high-quality japonica rice has opened at around 40 yuan. The rice shops and tea markets opened at 9:00 AM yesterday, and people's hearts became more stable. Large households released large quantities of rice, flooding the market. Buyers, however, are watching and unwilling to buy. As a result, the prices of japonica and indica rice both fell by one or two yuan.

Business Printing Committee Decides on Low-Priced Rice Sales

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Office's Low-Priced Committee of the Commercial Press has spared no effort in the matter of selling low-priced rice to all employees. Because the rice in Shanghai has been monopolized and manipulated by city merchants, causing market prices to skyrocket, it was resolved at the eleventh committee meeting that this month's rice price will be 40 yuan and 48 cents per shih, calculated at 40 yuan according to regulations. The names of colleagues and their families in Shanghai who will enjoy the benefits of low-priced rice sales have been announced. Those earning a monthly salary of 50 yuan or less will receive an additional 30% subsidy for low-priced rice sales. It is reported that each person can receive a maximum of 80 catties per month.

### Labor Strikes at Various Factories and Businesses - Settlement Authorities Pay Attention - Labor and Management Negotiations Are Harmonious - Expected to Be Resolved Within Days - High Rice Prices Are the Main Reason

Since Shanghai's rice prices have soared in recent days, workers in various factories and employees in various shops have initiated labor strikes due to limited income and the inability to support their families. However, both labor and management, recognizing the extraordinary times, have unavoidable difficulties and are still able to understand and negotiate solutions with each other. The labor side has agreed to strictly maintain order. The settlement authorities, in order to maintain commercial security within the settlement, attach great importance to this matter and are mediating at any time, while strictly enforcing rice price controls to prevent other incidents. The situation of the various factories and businesses currently on strike is as follows:

China National Goods Company

More than 800 employees of the China National Goods Company's general branch have put forward four demands to the company to improve their treatment: (1) No unjustified dismissals, (2) Public funds should be distributed equally, (3) A universal subsidy of 5 yuan per month should be given to each employee, (4) Bonus distribution should be calculated at 30%. On the day before yesterday (the 13th), the employees elected five representatives, Tao Zhikang, Dong Qigeng, Zou Zuoan, and Wu Zhensheng, to present these demands to Manager Li Kangnian. The company agreed to the first item but did not agree to the second, third, and fourth items, resulting in unsuccessful negotiations.

Temporary Work Stoppage: The Nanjing Road branch of the German Company and the first branch on Xinzha Road and the second branch on Taiping Bridge have been temporarily closed since yesterday due to a work stoppage by employees. Slogans from the employee side have been posted on the doors, such as "Implementing a Work Stoppage Due to Failure to Improve Treatment" and "Temporarily Implementing a Work Stoppage Due to Failure to Obtain Approval from the Authorities for Reasonable Demands." However, the employees are strictly maintaining order and remaining inside the various general branches, awaiting a solution. The police authorities have dispatched detectives to monitor the situation.

Yesterday's Negotiations: Yesterday, the company's 800-plus employees again elected the above five representatives to continue negotiations with the company. The company was represented by Director Gui Yanfang and Manager Li Kangnian. Gu Bingyuan, director of the Industry Section of the Municipal Council, also attended to mediate. The company instructed that business should be fully restored tomorrow (the day), and all demands should be submitted to the manager through the price leader for resolution by the board of directors. As the representatives did not receive the key points, the negotiations did not reach a satisfactory resolution. The representatives then convened all employees to report on the negotiations and urged them to maintain order. Last night, more than 800 employees stayed overnight at the general company on Nanjing Road.

Condolences from All Walks of Life: The Xin Sheng News reporter waited all day yesterday to inquire about news from the company. Since the company's employees went on strike, the company's business has completely stopped. In addition to the families of the employees visiting to inquire about the situation, Yong'an, Sincere, Great New, Commercial Press, China Underwear Company, Family Industry Society, Xiao Luzon Shoe and Hat Shop, World Bookstore, Guanshengyuan, Lao Jiuhe Silk and Satin Bureau partners, and others sent bread, biscuits, candy, and other items to express their condolences.

Wing On Textile Factory Three

Since prices of all goods in Shanghai have skyrocketed, Wing On Textile Factory Three on Maigen Road in this city has stipulated that workers can purchase low-priced rice worth 5 yuan per month. However, this was determined when rice prices were over 30 yuan (employees could purchase one dan). Since rice prices have risen to 48 yuan, workers feel that this 5-yuan rice subsidy is insufficient and elected representatives to meet with General Manager Guo on the morning of the 12th, requesting that a bonus of five months' salary be issued at the end of the year and hoping that the monthly rice subsidy could be slightly increased. As a result of the negotiations, the factory agreed to issue each person a reward of 5 yuan until the end of the year, which the workers could not accept, resulting in a stalemate. However, the workshops continued to operate as usual. At 6:00 PM, the night shift workers entered the factory to work, and the representatives who had been negotiating for a day also withdrew from the general manager's office. Reporting to the public that their request had not been satisfactorily answered, they unanimously decided to implement a work stoppage that night, while a large number of workers were assigned to guard the machinery in each workshop and maintain public order. The situation was very peaceful.

Water Source Cut Off: More than 3,500 workers stood all night. On the morning of the 13th, the workers again sent representatives to contact the factory. At this time, the entrances and exits inside and outside the factory had been sealed off, and two police cars and more than 60 Chinese and Western detectives had been dispatched by the police to distribute around the factory. The situation was very serious. The workers could only go out but not in, and the hot and cold water pipes were locked. Family members who went to deliver food could only use ropes to hoist it into the factory around the perimeter wall. The workers were hungry and cold for two days, and many female workers could not bear it.

Mediation in Progress: At 9:00 AM yesterday, the workers' representatives made a special appeal to the society, requesting assistance and relief and requesting Mr. Yu Qiaqing to serve as a mediator. Mr. Yu immediately agreed to mediate and sent a representative, together with Gu Bingyuan, a representative of the Industry Section of the Municipal Council, to the factory to summon both labor and management to negotiate. After several hours of negotiations, the management agreed to issue a bonus of one and a half months' salary at the end of the year, but refused to sign it. At 6:00 PM, it was still a stalemate.

Good Order: A female worker representative who could not re-enter the factory after leaving said, "Wing On Factory Three is a model factory in Shanghai's textile industry, so all the male and female workers in the factory will be able to maintain order without much maintenance in order to maintain this dignity. The machinery in each workshop is the source of life for both labor and management, and protection is even more strict. The workers' request to issue a bonus this year is not excessive, and we deeply hope that the factory can understand the workers' plight and accept it."

Factories in Pudong: Since the strike of employees at Shang Yih and Cold Storage Stack at 1500 Yangshupu Road began on the 12th, it has not yet been resolved. In addition, the Yih He Beer Company's brewing factory at 350 Dinghai Road, Pudong, has also gone on strike. Also, the labor unrest at Xiangmao Soap Factory, a British merchant at 2310 Yangshupu Road, and Hua Aluminum Steel Essence Factory, a Swiss merchant at 610 Meizhou Road, is still ongoing. The members of the "China Workers Welfare Society" at 127 Bazi Road are taking the opportunity to be active.

### The Truth About the Attempted Assassination of Mao Liying is Gradually Being Revealed - Had Received Threats for Organizing a Charity Exhibition - The Shooting May Be Related to the Previous Incident

The North-China Daily News reported that Miss Mao Liying, a British teacher who is usually enthusiastic about social work and supports the government, was suddenly shot by two Chinese men at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road on Sunday. She was hit in the abdomen and thigh and was hospitalized for treatment and guarded by the police. In order to save her life, the doctors performed a major operation yesterday (the 13th). Ms. Mao's condition is still serious, and there have been no other complications to date. After the shooting occurred, reporters immediately began investigating and yesterday had found out a new important event, as noted below.

Suspicious Car Speeds Away: It is said that at 7:00 PM on Sunday, after the shooting occurred, the two thugs sped around the corner, entered Sichuan Road, and reached Ningbo Road. An accomplice was waiting there in a black car. The two thugs then got into the car and fled together. About ten minutes later, a black car sped to a patrol team of the Avenue Edward VII near Hart Road, including police officers. Because the car was suspicious, they tried to stop it, but the four or five Chinese men in the car drew their guns and fired. The patrol team also returned fire.

Japanese Detective Hit By Bullet, Narrowly Escapes Death: It has now been revealed that during the exchange of fire, in addition to a Chinese passerby who was shot in the leg, a Japanese detective was also hit by a bullet that passed through his coat and entered his right armpit and chest, narrowly escaping death. The car continued to speed towards "Badlands." According to information obtained last night, one of the tires of the mysterious car has been deflated, possibly due to being hit by police fire. The car eventually drove into a house on Avenue Foch, which was originally heavily guarded by armed men. After the thugs' car drove in, guards were immediately dispatched to guard the front of the house.

Police Department Requests Assistance from the Japanese Side: It is said that on the night of the incident, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department requested the assistance of the Western District Headquarters of the Japanese Gendarmerie at 94 Avenue Foch in handling the case, but to no avail. No arrests were made. There have been some key points discovered regarding one of the pistols used in this assassination attempt. According to the examination of the empty cartridges, the weapon that fired the cartridges was once issued to a Chinese man. No cartridges were found at the Avenue Edward VII shooting location, as the thugs fired from inside the black car.

Ms. Mao Had Been Threatened Before: The incident in July when two Chinese men attempted to threaten Ms. Mao is now also considered to have new connections. The two Chinese men, who were trying to prevent Ms. Mao from hosting a charity exhibition, were arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Police Department. During the trial at the First Special District Court, the address given by the two Chinese men was also a house on Avenue Foch. They were sentenced to seven months' imprisonment but were then given a suspended sentence and released in early September.

### Opinions on Legal Sanctions Against Manipulation, Monopolization, and Speculation in Daily Necessities - Letter from Judge Jiang Fengquan

The standard for evaluation should be based on the principle of considering both production and consumption. The specific method is to use the average price of the three years or one year before the war as the standard for goods whose production and transportation costs have not been affected by the war or have been affected very little. For those affected by the war, the standard should be the cost after the war plus a reasonable profit (excerpt). (Article 6 of the Measures) Food grains are affected by transportation, so a reasonable profit can only be added to the cost after the war for evaluation. The so-called "cost" should be determined according to the actual number, and the "reasonable profit" should be determined according to general objective standards, rather than according to the subjective standards of each buyer or seller. It is now heard that the price limit is 45 yuan, which is indeed based on subjective factors and violates Article 6 of the Measures, so it cannot be used as an appropriate or effective standard. Article 12 of the Regulations stipulates that producers or operators of daily necessities must not engage in speculative, monopolistic, or other manipulative acts. If there is a violation, according to Article 31 of the Regulations, they shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than five years and fined one to three times the amount of profit obtained. Furthermore, if there is a violation of fair prices, according to Article 32 of the Regulations, they shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year, detention, or a fine of not more than 1,000 yuan. And according to Articles 11, 57, and 58 of the Criminal Law, the motive and purpose of the crime, the danger caused by the crime, and the profit obtained from the crime may be considered and judged at the highest degree within the legal range. The administrative authorities may force merchants or individuals who hoard large amounts to sell at the assessed price (Article 11 of the Measures).

All transactions between merchants or factories of daily necessities where the quantity bought and sold exceeds the actual existing quantity of goods, or where daily necessities are bought and sold according to standard goods and profits and losses are calculated based on differences, or where daily necessities are bought and sold on the market by parties who are not in the same trade and operate a futures market similar to an exchange, all belong to manipulative and speculative acts and shall be punished according to Article 31 of the Regulations (Article 13 of the Measures). Furthermore, if a merchant or factory fails to report to the Fair Price Committee, or provides false reports, or fails to sell at fair prices, or hoards large quantities in violation of the order for forced sale (this order is not limited to cases where a certain merchant is found to be hoarding before the order is issued; that is, if a general order is issued first and then a merchant is found not to be selling, this constitutes a violation of the order for forced sale and can be punished directly), all belong to violations of fair prices and shall be punished according to Article 31 of the Regulations (Article 14 of the Measures).

However, the prosecutor of the Special District Court has no right to prosecute the above-mentioned criminal acts, because it is stipulated in the agreement that the prosecutor of the Special District Court can only prosecute cases that infringe upon national legal interests. Therefore, this crime can only be prosecuted by the settlement authorities in their capacity as public prosecutors, or the victimized people can file a private prosecution against a specific merchant for purchasing goods at a price that violates fair prices, or for being unable to purchase from that merchant due to manipulation. Therefore, if the settlement authorities or the victimized people vigorously pursue the prosecution, and if the court's judges can act according to their conscience and impose severe punishment, I do not believe that the effect of suppression and stabilization cannot be achieved.

As for civil matters, transactions or contracts that violate fair prices or are for the purpose of manipulation and speculation are, of course, invalid and not protected because they violate mandatory and prohibitive provisions. In this era where democracy is valued, the public has the responsibility to assist when the administrative authorities' strength is insufficient, and the public has the right to supervise when political affairs are not implemented. Although the settlements are slightly different, it is difficult to make exceptions. Your association holds the reins of the public organizations in Shanghai and is the general collection of public opinions. You should take the lead and lead the various groups to urge the settlement authorities to vigorously pursue prosecutions based on relevant laws and regulations. I believe that the settlement authorities will be able to uphold the same determination as the national government in dealing with price controls for goods during the current European war, and to embody the spirit of humanity and justice advocated by democratic countries, adopt public opinion, and perform their duties. With this, I wish you good health. Sincerely, Jiang Quan, October 12 (End)

### American Woman Gets Drunk, Gets Pulled Into Brothel - Woman Living in Apartment Discovers Missing American Dollar Bills - Brothel Owner and Four Accomplices Arrested

Noble, an American who works as a fire department engineer, recently came to Shanghai from the United States and is residing in Room 416 of the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund. On the evening of the 10th of this month, Noble went out with friends to various dance halls and, due to excessive drinking, became slightly drunk. Around 4:00 AM, he hired a rickshaw, intending to return to his residence. Unexpectedly, the rickshaw puller was also

a prostitute pimp, who took Noble to the prostitute's brothel at 25 Lane 7 Guangxi Road. He then introduced Noble to Wang Xiaomei, a prostitute from Yangzhou (29 years old), for intimacy. At that time, Noble took off his coat and spent a good time with the prostitute Wang. After it was over, he returned to the Huizhong Hotel. Unexpectedly, he discovered that of the 290 American dollar bills stored in his pocket, only 40 remained. The remaining 250 had been stolen (equivalent to 3,375 Chinese yuan). He then reported it to the General Patrol Room. After investigation by Chinese detectives Wang Jinsheng and Qian Xianting, it was learned that it was stolen by someone from that

brothel. The brothel owner, Wang Changgui from Jiangbei, Xu Tianmin, the woman Wang Yang, and the prostitute Wang Xiaomei were all arrested on the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, prosecuted them for theft under Article 321 of the Criminal Law, stating that the defendants had admitted to the theft in the police station, but the amount was claimed to be 105 American dollars, which had been divided among the remaining individuals.

They are now planning to investigate the stolen money and arrest the accomplices, so they requested that the hearing be adjourned. After questioning by Judge Qian Hong, the defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang for defense. The court then ordered that they be detained pending an adjourned hearing.

### Death from Poison After Gambling Losses

Ding Shikui from Xiashi, aged twenty-nine this year, was a businessman in Shanghai. Recently, due to losses in various gambling dens in western Shanghai, he was unable to make amends, leading him to suicidal thoughts. The previous day, he went to the Sanpeng Hotel at 77 Balizhao Street in the French Concession, rented room number 61 under the pretext of lodging, and that night, he swallowed poisonous liquid and committed suicide. The following morning at 8 o'clock, the tea boy Shi Chunsheng discovered that Ding had already breathed his last.

### Fake Regime Forcibly Levies "Business Tax" in Extra-Settlement Areas
##### Sending Fake Officials to Extort Through All Means of Enticement and Intimidation
##### Shops, Understanding the Greater Good, Refuse to Pay

Since the fake "Municipal Government" had the fake Reformed Government cease subsidizing 400,000 yuan, its expenses have been dwindling daily. It is now actively encroaching on the road-building and police authority of the extra-settlement areas, attempting to levy various harsh taxes and duties in the area, in order to prolong its existence. The fake "Shanghai West Finance Bureau" had notified various businesses that it originally intended to,

Begin collecting

"Business Tax" starting October 1st, and stipulated that the tax rate would be 10, 20, or 30 per thousand. However, the businesses, citing declining business and inability to pay such heavy taxes, collectively opposed it. The fake regime, seeing widespread public anger, reduced the tax rates again, changing them to 1 per thousand for daily necessities, 2 per thousand for subsidized goods, and

3 per thousand

for luxury goods. Although most merchants and civilians, intimidated by brute force, temporarily tolerate it, very few actually pay. Recently, as the New Year is approaching, in order to make up for financial difficulties, the fake regime has been dispatching "micro-collection officers" to collect the so-called "winter business tax" from various businesses for days. When the "collection officers" come to collect, the merchants and civilians invariably tell them that

Thugs are rampant

and business is slow, requesting a grace period. But the "collection officers use all kinds of enticement and intimidation, claiming that those who pay before the New Year will have their taxes halved, and those who fail to meet the deadline will be ordered to close down." Upon hearing this, the merchants and civilians behind their backs cannot help but complain and curse. Because of this, the fake regime's budget for business tax revenue is feared to ultimately become a dream.

### Confirmation of the Tragic News of the Former Polish Consul-General in Shanghai

Dr. Klemens Sinki, former Counselor of the Polish Legation in China and Polish Consul-General in Shanghai, was killed by shrapnel during the siege of Warsaw. This was reported in the previous newspaper. According to further inquiries, Mr. Sinki passed away on September 25th. His students and old friends, upon hearing the news, deeply mourn. A memorial service for Dr. Sinki is scheduled to be held at the Christ the King Catholic Church on Route Ghisi this month. Dr. Sinki was a renowned international law scholar and served concurrently as a professor at Aurora University in Shanghai, producing many outstanding students. He had received the highest award from Pope Pius XI. Dr. Sinki had a profound understanding of Chinese literature. His research papers on Chinese culture have been published in Poland and the United States respectively. Therefore, the Western academic community is well aware that Klemens Sinki is one of the leading Sinologists.

### Approval by the Shanghai Municipal Council for Further Tram Fare Increase
##### Based on Mileage Calculation, Both First and Third Class Fares Appropriately Increased

The Shanghai Tram Company, citing declining exchange rates and increased expenses, had previously submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Council to increase fares in June of this year, which was approved. Now, the company, due to further changes in the city's economic situation, which have led to more substantial operating costs, has resubmitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Council to approve an increase in the average fare, from 3.11 national currency cents per mile for first class to 3.71 cents, and from 2.15 national currency cents per mile for third class to 2.54 cents. It is claimed that when the company last submitted a request for a fare increase in April, the prevailing national currency exchange rate was 8 pence and 7/32. By the time the Council approved it in June, it had fallen to 6 and a half pence. The Shanghai Municipal Council Public Utilities Committee held a meeting on the 5th of this month, where the case was brought up for discussion. The committee members unanimously agreed that the company's request did not exceed the maximum limit set in the amended operating concession of the company in 1930 and was still reasonable. It was decided to recommend to the Board of Directors that the increase should be approved. The above recommendation has been passed by the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors at its regular meeting on the 13th of this month.

### Damage Situation from the Bombing of Fenghua Xikou Clarified

He then served as a military aide to President Wilson, and in 1919, when the late Belgian King Albert and the Prince of Wales visited the United States, he served as a military aide. Soon after, he served as an adjutant to a general, the commander of the US Marine Corps Pacific Command in the old Yushan. From October 14, 1921 to June 30, 1924,

### Import and Export Firm Runner Turns Out to Be a Swindler
##### Colluding with Accomplices to Defraud the Owner
##### Arrested After a Street Brawl
##### Truth Uncovered, More Accomplices Apprehended

At around 11 o'clock the night before last, a brawl occurred between Ma Jinbiao from Ningbo and Ge Yiren from Jiading at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Hubei Road. After investigation by Chinese police, both were taken to the Lao Zha police station. The investigation was handled by the Chinese Detective Department. It was then revealed that Ge was a swindler, and two accomplices, Shao Jinkui and Chen Bingxiang from Ningbo, were apprehended at the Dongwu Hotel on Rue Wagner in the French Concession and taken back to the police station. Ge, Shao, and Chen were ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court, requesting personal escort in order to apprehend more accomplices. Qian Xunjiu,

the lawyer of the police station, stated the case, saying that the victim, Ma Jinbiao, is the manager of the Huaxing Import and Export Firm at 190 Beijing Road. The defendant, Shao Jinkui, was formerly a runner for the firm. On the 11th of last month, Shao told Ma that there was a customer who needed to purchase twenty-two boxes of pencils, worth eight thousand yuan, and invited Ma to the Mingyuan Relaxation Hall at 39 Zhejiang Road. At that time, there were three other people in the room, Yan Quansheng, Zhu Aqing, and Lu Yinsheng. Shao introduced them one by one, referring to Lu as the young owner of the Wen-Zou Yanxingyong Company, Zhu as the general manager, and Yan as the business director. After some small talk, they agreed to

talk again at the same place the next day. When Ma Jinbiao went again, Lu Yinsheng suddenly told Zhu that he had bad luck last night and lost four thousand yuan, and asked Zhu to pay another thousand yuan to make a final gamble. Zhu, acting on the orders of the young owner, naturally accepted and took out one thousand yuan in legal tender, handed it to Lu, and left. After a while, Zhu turned to Ma Jinbiao and said that the one thousand yuan was originally intended to pay you as a deposit for the purchase of pencils, but it was taken away by the young owner, and he will pay it later. At this point, Yan Quansheng suddenly joined in, saying that the money the young owner lost last night must have been from meeting a swindler, but I am also good at this, but I lack capital, otherwise I could make a fortune. He then persuaded Ma Jinbiao to provide capital. Ma, being

deceived by their sweet words, agreed to lend two thousand five hundred yuan. Because his status was too low, he rented room 501 at the China Hotel on Guizhou Road. At the time, Yan and others unanimously advocated that Ma should be the dealer, and Yan and Zhu pretended to be gamblers, inviting people to join the game so they could cheat from it. Unexpectedly, after a few rounds, Ma's two thousand five hundred yuan also came to an end. Yan and others blamed Ma for being careless and said they had to wait until tomorrow to try to win back the money. Afterwards, Ma explained the situation to a friend and realized that he had encountered a swindler (commonly known as a "field"). The defendant, Ge Yiren, was the ringleader and, knowing Ma Jinbiao well, pretended to help Ma investigate repeatedly

playing tricks from the sidelines. It wasn't until the day before yesterday that, due to a verbal conflict, he was arrested en route. After the police detained him, they went to the Dongwu Hotel and apprehended Shao Jinkui and Chen Bingxiang. There are still several accomplices at large, and the police are urgently investigating. They requested permission to detain them, etc. Subsequently, Ma Jinbiao confessed the circumstances of the fraud. After Judge Meng Tingke briefly questioned Ge, Shao, and Chen, he ordered them to be detained for seven days for further investigation.

### Two Concession Police Stations
##### Arrest Drug Dealers

Morphine dealer Wang Xiancai, also known as Mao, has been selling morphine and other drugs in the concessions for many years. Because he has multiple hiding places, he has managed to evade the law despite strict efforts to apprehend him. Recently, the Public Concession Police Station, because he was involved in a major drug case, dispatched detectives yesterday at around 11:00 am to the home of the drug dealer's uncle, Xue, at 15 Yushun Lane, Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession. However, Wang Xiancai and Xue had already fled upon hearing the news. It is now heard that the police department has issued an arrest warrant, vowing to bring him to justice.

### Sudden Increase in Shanghai's Mortality Rate
##### Coffin Supply Fails to Meet Demand
##### Alarming Number of Deaths, Approximately Six Thousand in Summer Months
##### Shanghai's Stockpile Only Sufficient for Four to Five Months

After the outbreak of the "August 13th" War in Shanghai, the Chinese army retreated westward, and the people in the occupied areas turned to Shanghai for refuge, viewing Shanghai as a safe haven. As a result, the population has increased year after year, reaching a maximum of about five million people. Consequently, the mortality rate has also gradually increased, and the supply of coffins has become increasingly busy. According to a recent survey, the number of deaths per month in the summer of this year reached about six thousand. Although it is now winter, the number of deaths is still around three thousand. With such a huge mortality rate, the demand for coffins requires the coffin industry to supply them. According to people in the industry, there is a growing trend of supply failing to meet demand. The coffin material, according to recent estimates, is only enough for a maximum of four to five months. If this is the case, Shanghai may soon experience a coffin shortage for the deceased.

### After Release, the Man Lee Mahler Ship
##### Has Not Yet Paid the Fine

The British Man Lee Mahler ship, which was trial-navigating to Wenzhou, was detained by the Wenzhou-Taizhou Garrison Command because it had not been registered with the authorities. It was released at 5 pm on the 9th. The goods carried to Wenzhou were valued at one million five hundred thousand yuan. According to the regulations of the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, a fine of one-third of the value of the goods must be paid. However, the company leasing the ship has not yet submitted the payment. Therefore, after the ship was released, it still cannot set sail for Shanghai. The Wenzhou merchants in this port who are selling the goods, including the paint and cotton yarn industries, believe that the merchants have suffered heavy losses because the goods have been detained for a long time. Therefore, they have sent a letter to the Wenzhou Association of Shanghai, requesting them to ask the authorities to inspect and release the detained goods. The association sent a telegram yesterday saying, "To the Yongjia County Chamber of Commerce: According to a letter from the Shanghai representatives of the Wenzhou paint and cotton yarn industries, the Man Lee ship illegally entered the port, causing it to be detained by the garrison troops, and an order to confiscate 30% of passengers and cargo. As the ship was not registered and entered the port without authorization, disregarding national laws and violating regulations, the lessee should be fully responsible. The merchants paid high freight charges and were deceived beforehand, so they should not bear any joint liability. Please telegraph the War Zone Commander to withdraw the order, and ask the Yongjia County Chamber of Commerce to uphold justice and appeal to the competent authorities to grant the return of the detained goods. The association is a fellow native organization and cannot remain silent. Please ask your association to uphold justice and provide assistance to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Greetings from the Wenzhou Association of Shanghai."

### Unresolved Case of Old Woman Poisoned to Death
##### Adopted Daughter Acquitted
##### Witness Girl Also Taken Back by Her Parents
##### Reaching an Agreement in Court, Ordered Not to Mistreat

Zhuang Xu, an old woman from Ningbo who lived at 146, Lane 572, Rue Bourret in the Public Concession, died suddenly of a cough on the night of January 16th of last year. Guo Cai, the old woman's niece, reported to the police that the old woman's death was suspicious, accusing Qian Zhuang, the adopted daughter of Zhuang Xu, of secretly adding poison to the medicine when it was being prepared, causing her death. Qian Zhuang's daughter, Qian Yuzhen (12 years old this year), witnessed the act. The police arrested Qian Zhuang, the adopted daughter of Zhuang Xu, and brought her to the First Special Court, where she was prosecuted for murder. The body of Zhuang Xu was then prepared for burial by Guo Cai, together with Qian Wenbiao (i.e., Qian Zhuang's husband). After the First Special Court

initial trial ruling, Qian Zhuang was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and deprived of her civil rights for life. Qian Zhuang's biological daughter, Qian Yuzhen, was sent to the Jiliang Institute because she had no one to support her. Qian Zhuang refused to accept the judgment and commissioned lawyers Ma Shouhua and Zhu Zhizhong to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. As a result of the trial, the original judgment was overturned, and Qian Zhuang was declared innocent. Qian Yuzhen was temporarily handed over to Guo Cai for adoption after being summoned by the Second Branch of the High Court. This case, from its inception to its conclusion, caused a sensation throughout Shanghai. After the case was closed, Qian Wenbiao asked Guo Cai to return his daughter Qian Yuzhen, but was refused.

He was refused permission to return and Qian requested the Civil Execution Division of the First Special Court to execute the return. Because Guo Cai lived at 2 and 14, House D, Lujia Lane, Lujiawan, French Concession, he was instructed to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court according to the law. Qian Wenbiao then filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court against Guo Cai, requesting mediation for the return of his biological daughter. Because mediation failed, Qian Wenbiao commissioned lawyer Zhu Zhizhong to formally file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against Guo Cai, demanding the return of his biological daughter Qian Yuzhen. The court, based on the complaint, ordered Judge Chen Can to open the Civil Seventh Court for trial yesterday afternoon. Both parties, accompanied by their lawyers, appeared in court. First, the plaintiff Qian Wenbiao

stated the previous situation and said that he had asked the defendant to return his daughter several times, but had been refused. He requested that the court order the return of his daughter to be supported by him. In response, Guo Cai said that she was willing to return the girl to the plaintiff, but the girl was afraid of being scolded by her parents and refused to go back, hiding at my place. I couldn't refuse. The girl had been sent to the Jiliang Institute, and the Second Branch of the High Court called me to temporarily adopt her. This summer, the girl fell ill and I treated her, borrowing and spending more than one hundred yuan. Today, the girl is in court, please question her. At this time, the girl Yuzhen walked from the audience to the front of the case, knelt down on both knees, and said, "Please help me, I would rather go to the Jiliang Institute again and not go home."

The court persuaded her that she should go home with her parents and not be stubborn. She was also informed that the plaintiff should not abuse the girl. After the discussion, both parties were persuaded to reconcile, ordering the plaintiff to repay the defendant twenty yuan for medical expenses previously incurred, which was paid in court. Both parties expressed their agreement, and the clerk prepared a reconciliation record, which was signed by both parties and their lawyers. The defendant returned the girl to the plaintiff, and they left the court. A sensational murder case that had shaken Shanghai had now come to a complete end.

### Family of Five
##### Dies by Poisoning
##### A Tragic Outcome Under High Pressure of Life

Li Axin, who lives in a pavilion room at 39 Changan Lane, across from the former Lao Gongmao Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road (now the Shanghai Yarn Factory, used by the Japanese to store military supplies), and works as a tailor in the Red Gang, has two sons and one daughter, and lives with his wife. Recently, Li has been ill and has been out of work for a long time. The family of five has no income and has been without food for three days. The day before yesterday, his wife borrowed three silver dollars from relatives and brought them back, instructing Li Zhu to buy firewood and rice. Li thought that with such expensive rice and firewood, three dollars would only maintain life for two or three days, and the future looked bleak. He became disillusioned with the world and told his wife that he would use the three dollars to buy six opium bubbles, bring them back, first dissolve the opium bubbles in water, instruct his two sons and one daughter to swallow them, and then the couple would swallow them together. After a while, the poison took effect, and the family of five died one after another. It is indeed tragic.

### Sick Man Abandoned
##### Died at the Entrance of the Lane
##### Cousin and Others Accused of Abandonment

Wang Yushi from Yancheng (32 years old) lived at 122, Lane 16, Changping Road. He had a cousin, Wang Youshan, who was an unemployed vagrant and consumed morphine. He had a leg disease, making it difficult to walk. He often visited Wang Yushi's house to chat. Recently, because of the cold weather and thin clothing, coupled with his opium addiction, he suddenly became seriously ill. At 5 pm on the 12th, he went to Wang Yushi's place in poor health. After a while, he collapsed and could not stand up, and his condition was very dangerous. The landlord, Guo Dechang, who was also from his hometown, said that the house was narrow and cramped, and it would be inconvenient if Wang Youshan died. He negotiated with the patient's brother, Wang Yushi. As a result, Yushi decided to have the landlord, Guo Dechang, and fellow tenants Guo Hailong and Sun Guangfu, help carry the patient to the entrance of the lane and lay him on the ground, so as to avoid the cost of a coffin. Wang Youshan died at 4 am the next morning. Li Zhaoguo, a Chinese detective from the Gordon Road Police Station, learned about the incident and telegraphed the police station to send Western Detective Smith to come.

### Grain Prices: Common Japonica Rice Already Fallen Below the Limit Price; Stocked at Warehouses 300,000+ Bags of Native & Foreign Rice; Large Shipments of Foreign Rice Ordered, Arriving Continuously; Transportation of Shanghai Rice Via Overland Route Often Detained, Yet Hope Remains for Control with No One to Regulate.

The Shanghai rice price issue has been addressed with thorough measures by the authorities of the two concessions. The public has been encouraged to report hoarding and price gouging. For offenders, goods are confiscated and protection is not granted, leading to eviction from the concessions, or punishment with hard labor. There are also rumors that certain rice merchants will receive severe warnings. Furthermore, to ensure the stability of order within the concessions, the concession authorities will not hesitate to adopt any severe measures to crack down on hoarding and manipulation. As a result, rice merchants and hoarders have become somewhat wary, disappearing and temporarily adopting a wait-and-see approach. Thus, the rice market has shown a declining trend. Yesterday, the market felt even weaker. Although inland supplies can be said to have disappeared due to various reasons, foreign rice and Jiangbei rice are arriving at the port in a continuous stream, crowded and plentiful enough to meet demand. Consequently, common japonica rice has fallen below the limit price, which is a welcome phenomenon.

Moreover, the Shanghai warehouses are found to be stocked with a considerable quantity. Regarding Saigon rice, according to insiders, the Taikoo, Roosevelt, and Kung Ho Hsiang warehouses alone contain no less than 70,000 to 80,000 bags. Orders amount to 150,000 to 160,000 bags, and arrivals occur daily. Other varieties such as Japonica Yuan and native sharp rice stored in the banks of the China Communications Bank and Xingye Bank and other native warehouses are also in substantial quantities, estimated at 230,000 to 240,000 bags. Given such enormous warehouse stocks, even if inland supplies are difficult to clear for the time being, there should be no concern for the food supply of Shanghai residents. Furthermore, a large amount of foreign rice is being loaded and shipped continuously, and it will not be fully delivered until February or March of the coming spring. In addition, there are two reasons for the potential decline in the population of the concessions: firstly, the North-South Iron Gates are expected to open soon, facilitating transportation and enabling people to consider relocating; and secondly, the exorbitant prices in Shanghai make it impossible for ordinary wage earners to sustain themselves, potentially forcing them to return to their hometowns. Therefore, the population of the Shanghai concessions may decrease significantly after the end of this lunar year, which is certainly related to the prosperity of the concessions.

Unexpectedly, this year's rice harvest in Japan and Korea has been poor. According to estimates, there is a shortage of 25 million stones. As a result, rice shortages in various parts of Japan are becoming increasingly serious. Although the Japanese Ministry of the Army has launched a "No Rice Day" campaign, it is practically useless. The Japanese government's relief measures include: (1) ordering large quantities of foreign rice, in addition to the 1.2 million bags already ordered, with plans to order another large amount of rice from foreign countries at the beginning of next year; (2) forcibly purchasing rice from farmers in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan to prevent hoarding and speculation; and (3) implementing rice rationing in areas under Japanese military influence. In China, it seeks to expand its military sphere of influence in various regions, forcing those who have fled to other places to return to their hometowns due to heavy burdens. This is why more than a hundred rice transport ships traveling to Shanghai via inland rivers have often been intercepted in the Pudong and Minhang areas, a major reason for the recent scarcity of goods arriving by river. Moreover, goods transported by rail are also often blocked in the North Station and Hongkou area, preventing inland goods from being transported into the two concessions. Furthermore, goods originally intended for Shanghai are being detained at inland stations. It is reported that Jiangyin alone has 160 to 170 train cars, and the Sujia Road area, such as Suzhou Station, has 50 to 60 train cars, and Jiashan Fengjing has 30 to 40 train cars. Considering each car carries 125 bags, there are approximately 260 cars, totaling 32,500 bags. Calculating each bag at 1.5 dan, this equals 48,750 stones. Such a large amount of goods being obstructed undoubtedly strikes a blow to the food supply of the residents within the concessions. What is even more ridiculous is that the detained rice is all accompanied by purchase certificates, but they are not recognized once they arrive in Shanghai. One merchant transported ten cars of rice to Shanghai, totaling over a thousand bags, which were immediately detained and subject to confiscation. After various negotiations, the rice was nominally purchased at a price of 15 yuan per bag to resolve the matter. Although foreign newspapers recently reported that a certain party is willing to cooperate with the two concessions to alleviate the Shanghai rice shortage and will provide a large supply, not to mention anything else, as long as the rice transported into the concessions is not hindered, the rice price can be reduced to a flat rate, which is to act according to what is said.

Although the people of Shanghai have suffered such pain, as long as no one manipulates the market, there is still hope for rice supply regulation. Just like yesterday's rice market, affected by the influx of foreign rice, japonica sharp rice and other varieties also followed the price of foreign rice downward. Merchants had to sell at a loss. The most satisfying thing is that the general hoarders and speculators, who used to live high off the hog, are now scraping the barrel and can no longer act slyly. Therefore, regardless of retail or wholesale merchants, seeing that there is no hope for a market turnaround, except for stores that have to replenish their stock as needed, they do not dare to purchase too much rashly. The citywide transactions can be described as quiet. Statistics show that transactions mostly do not exceed two or three thousand bags. The closing market prices show that thick japonica rice is in wider use and sells in larger quantities, while the price declines of other goods are slightly slower, but still depreciating by one to one and a half yuan compared to the previous day. Common japonica rice is 43 yuan, Kunsu japonica rice is 41-42 yuan, and thin japonica rice has been cut by about 2 yuan. Qingsi Extra Thin rice has little to no transaction and only opens at 39.5 yuan, 39 yuan. Fengjia and other spot goods are only 37-38 yuan. As for varieties like Lu Yang sharp rice, the previous prices were close to japonica rice, but they were hit even harder by foreign rice, with the most severe price drops of two or three yuan. Top-quality Changbang Yang Sharp rice only sells for 39 yuan, and Southbang goods only sell for 36-37 yuan. Lu Sharp Extra goods are also only 39.5 yuan, followed by 38 yuan. As for guest sharp rice, the price drop was already more thorough in the previous market. Yesterday, Jiangbei and Jingwu sharp rice opened at 35 yuan, only a drop of more than 1 yuan. Yinbian Yuan followed and dropped by 1 to 2 yuan. Regarding the price drop of various spot goods, on the surface, it seems that only 4 to 5 yuan has been dropped in these few days, but in fact, considering the quality differences between the goods, the difference has already plummeted by more than 8 yuan. It will be difficult for the future trend to stabilize, which can slightly comfort people's hearts, and the general public can also benefit greatly.

Guest indica rice continuously arrives, and merchants are again seeking late purchases. Coupled with the influx of foreign rice crowding the market, the market gradually softens. Yesterday morning, newly arrived and returned goods were sold at lower prices, and the market plummeted all the way down. High-quality guest indica rice only opened at 34-35 yuan, and medium spot machine indica rice and broken rice followed the decline, about 1.3 to 1.5 yuan lower than the previous day. However, goods on the way arrive in Shanghai continuously, and the future trend continues to show weakness.

The spot price of foreign rice saw a sharp decline, and goods on the way showed weakness. This is because existing stocks are abundant, and arrivals are surging. In addition to the goods being unloaded, the firms are eager to sell due to financial constraints. Currently, Saigon rice is 36.45 yuan in the early market, 35.5 yuan in the noon market, and lacked buyers in the afternoon, closing at 35 yuan, about 2 yuan lower than the previous day. Goods on the way were originally priced at 43 yuan per package in the early market, but only 42 yuan in the afternoon, nearly 2 yuan lower per picul.

Yesterday, another large batch of foreign rice was imported. Taikoo Company's Hubei ship brought 7,645 bags from Hong Kong, and the Haikou ship brought 13,222 bags from Hong Kong, totaling 20,867 bags, which are being unloaded.

### Flour Mill Gains Again: Another 20 Cents

Flour: Yesterday, the current flour mill market rose again by 20 cents. The price of Zheng brand No. 2 flour has been changed to 8.7 yuan, and its rising trend can be said to be not small. This is because the recent sales of local goods have been not weak, and although rice prices have fallen slightly, the extent is not significant. The price of flour is still higher than the price of rice, and the high cost of wheat at 15 yuan or more is the reason for the mills' firm intention to sell. In addition to supplying the local retail market, they still restrict large-scale purchases from merchants. Therefore, the asking price for returned Green Cannon Car goods has reached 9.23 yuan, but there is no formal market. The transaction of Japanese flour is still normal. The initial asking price for Phoenix Wind brand in December was 8.3 yuan, but the entry was not smooth, and there were many sellers, so the price returned to 8.23-8.24 yuan. The subsequent market was only at 8.17-8.18 yuan. The quoted price for January continues to be 8.68-8.69 yuan. Also, 1,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tanggu today.

Wheat: Yesterday continued to be firm and popular, and the mills were eager to purchase. The Fufeng Mill bought more than 10,000 bags at a price of 15 yuan, while the Fuxin Mill did not purchase for the time being. There were also five or six cars of transactions in the market, with prices at 15 yuan and 14.78 yuan. The market is ultimately easier to rise than to fall.

### Oil Market: Raw Oil Rises Again by 3 Yuan; Soybean Oil Price Slightly Decreases

Raw Oil: Although there are no inquiries from the Hong Kong merchants, merchants claim that transportation is difficult and their intention to sell remains firm. Therefore, the market rose again by 3 yuan yesterday. 300 cans of Jiangbei tin-packed oil were traded at a price of 101-102 yuan, and 40 barrels of barrel-packed oil were traded at a price of 100 yuan. 200 cans of Yantai tin-packed oil were traded at a price of 100 yuan, and 250 pieces of Jiao oil for delivery in two weeks were ordered at a price of 78 yuan. Also, 500 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong today.

Soybean Oil: Under the rising price of peanut oil, it has suffered less humiliation. The price of basket-packed oil has fallen by 6 yuan from the highest price, while the price of barrel-packed oil has decreased by only 1 yuan due to the shortage of arrivals and stocks. A total of 300 pieces of Qingqi oil were traded at a price of 88 yuan, 300 groups of local factory oil were traded at a price of 95 yuan, and 10 barrels of Qingdao oil were traded at a price of 120 yuan.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Forward Settlement Flourishes

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listing and announcement remained unchanged. In the black market for British and American exchange rates, due to rumors of a large amount of cotton and wheat settlement in February next year (one said that a special telegram was sent from Hong Kong to Shanghai to purchase settlement), the market suddenly turned from loose to extremely tight. The process of the day: the morning opening was due to the rise in the exchange rates of the US and British currencies, so it re-presented the situation of British balance and American looseness. Later, because the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu suddenly came to express, so it once still brought hardness, with British gold to 4 pence 6875, the US exchange rate reached 7 yuan 6875, during which HSBC and Sassoon absorbed the most. Unexpectedly, the buy intention of Chinese banks also rose, resulting in the market phenomenon back to tight softness. Then, due to the consistent outpouring of Hong Kong electricity, it suddenly came to grab fiercely, so the foreign companies saw the situation and bought a large amount of far-month US dollars, and HSBC's acceptance was still strong, and the buying trend gradually expanded, tightening step by step. Until about 2 pm, British gold fell to 4 pence 53125, the US exchange rate fell to 7 yuan 375, and finally, Qiao Zhifu came again to sell, and at the same time, Chinese banks and foreign countries had congestion, and the situation began to slightly return to looseness, with British gold to 4 pence 5625, the US exchange rate to 7 yuan 46875, but the closing US exchange rate still reported 7 yuan 46875, British gold was 4 pence 546875, the result was tighter than the previous day by 0.078125, the US was softer by 0.125, the futures transaction was still flourishing, the trend was the same as the spot.

The French are both flat, against Shanghai long 0.0625, US against British rises by 1 point 125, against French rises by 10 cents 5 points, against French big 625.

The morning opening spot selling price of the bank, British gold is 4 pence 625, the US exchange rate is 7 yuan 625, compared to the previous closing, British is flat and the US is looser by 0.03125, which is why the exchange rate has risen seven times. After opening, the Jewish merchant first came to jam to HSBC, the spot British gold 4 pence 6875, and at the same time resold to HSBC a certain bank spot US exchange rate 7 yuan 6875, and sold to Sassoon the January US exchange rate 7 yuan 5625, at that time the foreign bank was also willing to supply the spot US exchange rate 7 yuan 65625, so the process brought hardness, HSBC listing announcement did not move, the silver balance tax announcement was big 0.25, suddenly heard that there was a shocking huge amount of cotton and foreign wheat settlement from Hong Kong electricity, the foreign bank's supply intention suddenly faded, Chinese banks and British merchants Sassoon and others also grabbed settlement from all sides, and then started a fierce tight wind, counted Sassoon grabbed foreign banks spot British gold 4 pence 625, Chinese banks grabbed foreign banks spot British gold 4 pence 59375, Hong Kong electricity and foreign banks such as the Great Eastern Bank purchased the January US exchange rate 7 yuan 4375 and 375, and at the same time HSBC also absorbed the January British gold 4 pence 5625 of the same bank, until noon, the situation turned stable, the afternoon bank spot selling price of British gold 4 pence 5625, the US exchange rate 7 yuan 46875, than the morning opening British tightened by 0.0625, the US was softer by 0.15625.

Jewish Merchant's Jam Slightly Returns to Stability

It is estimated that the spot US exchange rate of 7 yuan 4375 and the January US exchange rate of 7 yuan 3125 were grabbed in the foreign bank. Later, the Chinese merchants grabbed again the current month US exchange rate of 7 yuan 375 in a certain bank. At that time, the tightest spot price would have shouted more than 4 pence 53125 and 7 yuan 375. After entering, the Chinese banks and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu were selling at a profit, and at the same time, it was said that foreign countries also had selling positions, so it became slightly more stable.

### Hong Kong Merchants Advance Fiercely: Gold Market Goes Straight Up

Yesterday's cash "cooked red" black market situation, with the return of softness in the exchange market, began to show a glimmer of dawn. Further, with the sudden return of absorption from Hong Kong merchants, it rose fiercely by 93 yuan. However, the opening was still in a weak situation. At the beginning, it plummeted by 33 yuan, and then fell again by 15 yuan to a low of 4,035 yuan. This was because the foreign exchange market was still showing looseness at that time, and the gold shops and retail investors were giving up generously. After that, the exchange market turned sharply tight and soft again, and the Hong Kong merchants repeatedly commissioned a certain money exchange shop to advance tirelessly, which made the buyers' spirits greatly boosted. Many outsiders also dragged in a lot, and the price soared straight up, reaching a high point of 4,205 yuan at 2:00 pm. After entering, the foreign exchange market was slightly harder, and at that time, a certain money exchange shop and securities firms sold out for profit, and it once returned by 55 yuan. Finally, with the upward trend of the people's hearts and the re-entry of Hong Kong merchants, it closed at 4,175 yuan. The whole day's transaction was very prosperous, about four or five thousand taels. The gold ornaments in jewelry stores rose and fell suddenly, and finally rose by 5 yuan. The customs gold and other prices remained flat.

"Cooked Red" Returns and Rises by 93 Yuan: Since the initial opening of each bar (ten taels) in the morning, due to the foreign exchange market tightening, the people's spirit was still sluggish, and there was a sound of shouting to sell. The market opened and pressed down by 32 yuan. The gold shops sold 20 taels to the jewelry shops for 4,050 yuan. After a short time, under the selling wind of retail investors and cash gold shops, it fell again by 15 yuan. The gold shops sold 10 taels to the money exchange shops for 4,035 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop suddenly came to pick up, and the money exchange shops also dragged in, and the price immediately rose by 25 yuan. The gold shops entered 30 taels for the securities firms for 4,060 yuan. After the securities firms sold out, it would fall again by 10 yuan. But at that time, the exchange market suddenly turned tight and soft, and the people's hearts were greatly boosted. A certain securities firm stopped selling and re-entered, and the price rose again by 40 yuan. The securities firms entered 20 taels for the money exchange shops for 4,090 yuan. Later, because the jewelry shops frequently jammed, it fell again to 4,075 yuan. After that, a certain money exchange shop suddenly took the place of Hong Kong merchants to grab fiercely. The exchange market continued to report softening, and the people's hearts were greatly boosted. Soon after, it passed the 4,100 yuan mark. Then, the securities firms and retail investors also followed up to buy, and it soared again by dozens of yuan. The money exchange shops did 50 taels for each other for 4,170 yuan. Then, with the exchange market slightly settled, a certain gold shop made a profit and returned to the market, and a certain money exchange shop still had sales, and it returned by 40 yuan. The money exchange shops sold 20 taels to the securities firms for 4,130 yuan. At noon, the Hong Kong merchants resumed their buying trend, and a certain silver shop also followed up slightly, and it rose again by 40 yuan. The gold shops entered 20 taels for a certain silver shop for 4,170 yuan. Then, the gold shops sold 10 taels to the money exchange shops for 4,167 yuan as the noon closing price. After the closing, the retail investors continued to come to grab, and then it was raised to 4,185 yuan. At the initial opening in the afternoon, the gold shops first sold 10 taels to the securities firms for 4,180 yuan. Later, because the foreign exchange market reported tightness, and a certain money exchange shop took the place of the Hong Kong merchants to grab again, it rose again by 25 yuan. The securities firms entered 20 taels for the gold shops for 4,205 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange shop's intention to sell turned stronger, and the securities firms also followed to sell, and the exchange market was slightly balanced, so it returned by 55 yuan. The securities firms sold 30 taels to the money exchange shops for 4,150 yuan. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong merchants came to move again, and raised it again by 45 yuan. The money exchange shops entered 20 taels for the securities firms for 4,195 yuan. After entering, a certain gold shop made a profit and sold out, and the retail investors also concluded, and it fell back by 23 yuan. The money exchange shops sold a few taels to the cash gold shop for 4,172 yuan. Then, the gold shops did 20 taels for each other for 4,175 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it returned and rose by 93 yuan compared to the previous day. The whole day fluctuated by 170 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand of gold was several yuan higher than that of "cooked red", and the purchase was reduced by 10 yuan. The current marked gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Ornamental Gold Results in a 5 Yuan Increase

After a while, it hung high by 5 yuan. At 2:40 pm, it was another big 5 yuan. At 3:00, it returned by 5 yuan. The result was that it hung high by 5 yuan. The Datong Bank changed to hang 420 yuan. The new banks had the same price as the upper price, and the purchases were all reduced by 15 yuan.

### Securities: Bond Market Lingers

### Cotton Yarn: Factory Costs Increased; Cotton Yarn Returned for Traction; Double Horse Soared by 17 Yuan

The yarn market trend is rising, and the rising trend is gradually intensifying. This is because the overseas European and American cotton markets are only rising, resulting in the daily increase in raw cotton, and the factory's cost must be increased, so there is a part of the slightly more income in the market, but there are other arguments that the inventory of 20-count cotton yarn is too thick, the idea is still normal, not to be driven by the actual needs. However, the price of 32-count and 42-count single yarn thread is particularly strong. Because the raw materials are mostly imported cotton, the foundation of the yarn market can be consolidated by measuring the general trend.

The trading of local cotton is becoming increasingly frequent, mostly dominated by transactions among peers. Factories such as Shenxin, Anda, and Xinyu have slightly increased their demand, leading to exceptional market enthusiasm. This is due to the relentless rise in overseas Indian and American cotton markets, showing a clear upward trend. Consequently, domestic cotton is also thriving. However, general hand-picked cotton has already yielded substantial profits, leading to gradual selling, thus moderating the upward trend.

Chronicles

### Returning from "Children's World"

— Yangyi

The Sincere Company's annual "Children's World" is once again set up in a corner of the company's fourth floor, nearing the Gregorian New Year. Although I am a young man in my twenties, I still possess a childlike innocence, so when I walked past the company's entrance and saw the four innocent and beautiful characters of "Children's World" under Santa Claus's large bag, my heart couldn't help but flutter slightly, and I headed into the Sincere Company's entrance. As I climbed the stairs, a "large cartoon" mouse attracted me, and I immediately felt as interested as I had in my childhood.

"Children's World" has a facade made of green colored paper, and the door is so low. A middle-aged man in a suit stands at the entrance. There is a large round hole where tickets are sold. The ticket price is one dime, which can be used to purchase anything in "Children's World."

I walked forward, and the entrance was crowded with a dozen or so children in less-than-clean clothes. Some of them were carrying schoolbags under their arms, and they timidly looked into the doorway past the tall ticket collector in the evergreen woolen uniform—it was "Children's World"! But they were excluded from it!

The ticket-selling area was filled with adults, some of whom were leading children. I bought a ticket and entered "Children's World." It was colorful and decorated with a truly "fairy-tale" feel. I regretted forgetting to bring my child with me.

The first thing I saw was a three-dimensional scene of "large cartoons." In the past, it was the "Wizard of Oz" that was about to be shown at the Dahua Theater, and further back, it was the world-famous fairy tale "The Adventures of Pinocchio." I had read this fairy tale, and now seeing the three-dimensional scene, I saw Pinocchio, his father the old carpenter, and some of Pinocchio's friends from the zoo. As I stood in front of the scene, this strange meeting reminded me of the entire story of New York Pinocchio, and it flashed through my mind in an instant.

Although it's called "Children's World," there weren't many "children" playing in this "world," but rather more adults. Those adults came to "Children's World" just to buy things related to children for their children.

There were also adults who came with their children. I saw a middle-aged man supporting a four- or five-year-old child, pointing to the "fairies" in the three-dimensional scene of "The Wizard of Oz," and asking the child, "Who is this?" But I was sure that the child knew nothing except that it was colorful.

I also saw a mother who wasn't very wealthy. Her child wanted to buy a doll, but the price of the doll was too expensive! The child's eyes welled up with tears, and I felt the sadness of children in this "Children's World."

"Children's World" was broadcasting Hollywood songs, and the English words were all year round. I believe the children couldn't understand or read them.

When I exchanged my ticket for two bags of candy, I deeply hoped that the Sincere Company could best arrange the "Children's World" to be more "Chinese" and, at the same time, contain a bit of educational meaning. It would be best to set aside a separate room for things like dolls, dedicated to purchases, and the ticket price of two dimes could be reduced to one dime, so that more children could enter.

### A Voice from the Rice Pile

This is a letter written by a rice shop clerk. Except for slight revisions to a few words that were not fluent, all of it is a cry from the depths of this clerk's heart. With the price of rice so high, the rice shop owners still have to "cheat," and the suffering of this clerk, who is responsible for "execution," is truly moving—we hope that clerks from all industries can often write to us, reporting everything you see and the pain you suffer.

Editor: I am a clerk in a rice shop. All day long, I work on adding stone powder to the rice, adding lower-quality rice, carrying rice bags, sewing burlap sacks, and dealing with customers who buy rice. I don't have any free time all day. But this year our shop's business is particularly good, and the boss has already made tens of thousands of dollars. He treats us much more politely, and our wages have been increased, and the vegetables are better. I am quite comfortable living alone in Shanghai, but my friends and relatives are all crying poor, saying that they cannot live. One very poor relative has six children, and they only eat one meal of rice a day, and two meals of rice soup, which is extremely pitiful! I think every day that our landlady wants to play mahjong, and earlier it was small mahjong, but now it's ten yuan bottom. The eldest daughter used to be very down to earth, but now she's becoming fashionable, and she's often invited to see movies. Why is our boss comfortable, but my relatives are poor? And I am subjected to a special insult. No matter what relative or friend, they always call me a "rice weevil" and many other unspeakable words, as if I am inferior to others. I also think that my boss has made tens of thousands of dollars in more than half a year. We are getting rich, but we are starving people to death. No wonder people hate us. Now I am determined to leave the rice industry and not do this unconscionable and immoral business, to avoid people saying I am inferior. I ask your newspaper to publish this letter. I want to write a little about the inside story of the rice industry, and I ask the passionate youths of all industries to expose the inside stories of all industries, to avoid everyone being harmed. Please correct this incoherent letter, sir, I am very grateful. Below is the inside story of the rice industry: first-class rice is mixed with second-class rice; stone powder is mixed in the rice; the weight is insufficient; the more burlap sacks are patched, the happier the boss is. The high price of rice is jointly decided by the industry, and it is planned. The工部局limited price of 45 yuan is what our boss is most happy about. From a Little Rice Shop Clerk

### Suggestions for Implementing Winter Home Protection (Part 2)

— Xing

Suggestions for Preventing Thieves

Affected by the war, it is not uncommon for five or six households to live in one house on the isolated island. Although they live in the same house, neighbors are not easy to get acquainted with each other due to the complicated population. If a sudden "uninvited guest" comes and goes straight upstairs, no one will interfere. Each family has the attitude of "sweeping the snow in front of their own door and not caring about the frost on other people's roofs," until they find that something has been stolen or a robbery has occurred, then it is too late! Therefore, the doors and gates must be closed at hand, and if there are strangers visiting, they must be questioned clearly, especially in the early morning or evening, it is easiest to mix in thieves. When pouring water or taking out the garbage, it is often thought that it is only a brief moment and is ignored. In fact, most thefts occur at this time, so don't take it lightly.

Before going to bed at night, every house should have a detailed inspection to see if the doors and windows are completely closed and secure, and whether there are any small thieves hiding in the house. If possible, each building should be used as a unit, and all the residents in this unit should have the obligation to take turns on duty. Each person should take turns on duty every day, and the person on duty must monitor whether each household has closed its doors and windows properly, and whether the embers in each person's own stove have been completely extinguished. If servants are hired, because they have limited knowledge, the masters must explain in detail the dangers of fire and theft and how to prevent them. In short, whether it is the landlord or the tenant, the master or the servant, all should share the work of safety prevention, and there must be no interruption for one day to be effective. If we can cooperate and urge each other to implement the work of winter home protection, we can not only get the best guarantee for preserving life and property, but also develop good habits of discipline at the same time!

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 18 Discussing Economic Prosperity and Reviving the Old City, Narrating Marriage Plunder and Tracing the Legacy

The location is relatively biased towards the western district, but the roads are newly built; the air is also very fresh. Even if it is a little far away, fortunately they all have their own cars, so there is no inconvenience. Moreover, there are now many newly opened roads there, and there are also few new buildings, and there are several universities. The current Shanghai has expanded a lot more than before the war. In the pre-war municipal government, they often shouted about the Greater Shanghai! Greater Shanghai! But that was just talk. At this moment, it can be said to be a truly Greater Shanghai. Huang Peijiang has built a large bridge, directly from Puxi to Pudong, which is especially convenient, so Pudong has also prospered. Therefore, several Chinese construction engineers are very busy, and many European and American construction engineers have also come, all registered with the municipal government and joined the Chinese Architects Association. Now that we have talked about the new houses of Lin Jiancheng and Jin Danyu, we must also talk about their honeymoon trip. According to Jin Danyu's idea, traveling during the honeymoon between the new husband and wife has a kind of sweetness. But should we travel domestically or abroad? If we travel domestically, she has served as a guide for foreign guests, and has often accompanied foreigners to many famous scenic spots in Southeast China. Even Lin Jiancheng, for the sake of construction projects, often runs to other provinces and counties. Even if traveling between husband and wife has a different kind of flavor, why rush to do it during the honeymoon? She also said: This honeymoon trip has never been done by Chinese people, it was passed down from Europe. Chinese people often think that everything from Europeans and Americans is right, fashionable, and modern. Europeans and Americans have one thing, and Chinese people want to learn one thing. In fact, this honeymoon trip is probably a kind of barbaric legacy from Europe. She said: In the era before Europe entered civilization, a kind of marriage plunder was popular. What is marriage plunder? It is taking other people's daughters and robbing them to be your own wives. In the barbaric era, it all depended on physical strength to do the act of taking by force. A man's physical strength is of course stronger than a woman's, so he could rob her by force. Do you remember that ten years ago, the custom of "robbing the bride" was still popular in the Chinese countryside? It can be seen that the custom of marriage plunder also existed in China. But a girl is taken away by force, and the girl has no power to resist. Her family has parents, uncles, and brothers, all of whom are men, and maybe they are strong. For example, if the men in this village rob the women in this village, wouldn't they want to take them back? Therefore, the men who robbed the women quickly avoided this place and ran elsewhere to avoid being taken back by the woman's family. In the age of civilization, it is beautifully called: "Honeymoon Trip." (215)

Entertainment Circle

### A Small Suggestion — About "Confucius" on the Silver Screen

— Zefu

I have been reading the news published in the "Entertainment Circle" that Confucius is also going to be on the screen, which is indeed something that can make people excited. Because the so-called ancient costume or historical films in China have always been either about gods and martial arts in the early stage, or about talented scholars and beautiful women in the later stage. Although there are also so-called national consciousness films, the backbone of the story is still inseparable from romance; the story that was originally a romance is just wrapped in a layer of national consciousness. Therefore, it often looks very unnatural, at least making people feel that the story was not originally like this.

Now there is a historical film about Confucius (I think this can indeed be called a purely historical film, or an art film). It is neither about gods and martial arts, nor about romance scenes. Although Mr. Lin Yutang once wrote "Zi Jian Nan Zi," this is ultimately some meddling. Moreover, there are many stories about Confucius, and he did not stay in the State of Wei for long. Even if it is to be performed, it will only be a part of the film. Confucius was busy traveling around the states and compiling the Six Classics. I think the directors will certainly focus on these two aspects, and there will be nothing else.

I am saying these few words not because I dislike romance films. I believe that since ancient costume films are so popular now, it would be a good idea to shoot some purely historical films. There are quite a few historical events in our country that can be made into movies, so why only focus on romance? Therefore, these few words can be said to be in favor of bringing Confucius to the screen, and not to criticize other romance films, so please readers do not misunderstand.

But shooting Confucius is very difficult. For example, the lack of romance scenes (or very few) will make the audience who are used to watching romance films feel bored. Moreover, Confucius ran around in many places. When we read the historical records of the Confucius family, we sometimes can't figure it out (perhaps this is because my personal brainpower is insufficient). It is very difficult to understand which country he was in in which year without listing a table. I think that since this film is being shot, the entire experience of Confucius's life should be fully included, and nothing should be neglected. If only a few exciting segments are extracted, I always feel that something is missing. Because this film should achieve two goals: one is to still be considered a movie, so that the audience can watch and entertain; the other is to treat it as a historical record of the Confucius family, to be read as a historical textbook. I think the latter meaning is very important; China has not yet had such a film, and now that there is such a good subject matter, then why not try it and use it for both purposes?

Or someone will ask: If you say so, I am afraid that the film cannot be shown completely in two hours. And there are many things that do not have a story, such as before Confucius met Nan Zi, there is this sentence in the family history: "Going to Ji Guo, for more than a month, returning to Wei." This Guo Pu does not have any facts to say, and I also don't know what happened within more than a month. May I ask how to perform it on film? I say that there are methods, but it is not to act but to use a map. First, draw a map of the countries that Confucius has traveled through. This method is often seen in foreign news films, and I think we may also borrow it. If there is no story to be performed, then show this map, indicating that Confucius is now crossing the Pu (use an active arrow to move on the screen), and it is best to note the year on the map. In this way, I think it will not be boring to watch, but it will give the audience a good knowledge.

As long as this map is drawn well, of course it can be shot larger or smaller, and there is no need to keep it as the same shot, like a historical map hanging on the blackboard. When crossing Guo, you may as well shoot in the area of Pu, and you can ignore the rest.

This will not make people feel tired of looking at this large map all the time.

These are really just some suggestions that may or may not be useful. Perhaps the directors had already expected this, then consider what I said as nonsense.

### Hollywood Changes Its Style with a Combination of Soft and Hard Approaches

— Huicun

After the outbreak of the European War, American film companies were greatly affected, forcing filmmakers to change their film production policies. It is reported that the new style of film production in Hollywood is to use a combination of soft and hard approaches. On the one hand, they are shooting a lot of hard films about war and slaughter, and on the other hand, they are shooting erotic and light-hearted sensual films. The former is represented by films such as "The Roaring Twenties," "The Fighting 69th," and "Thunder Ablont," while the latter is represented by films such as "On Your Toes" and "Etranlly Youis," all of which are extreme works.

### The Cast of Empress Dowager Cixi

— Fuyun

News about the Empress Dowager Cixi by the Xifeng Society was published in various newspapers half a month ago. Here, I will supplement what I know to fill in what has not been mentioned in the articles:

The play was written by Mr. Zhou Jianchen. Mr. Zhou is usually good at drama, and his articles are often found in various publications. The script of the Empress Dowager Cixi has been ordered to be published by the China Book and Magazine Company and will be sold before the public performance of the Empress Dowager Cixi.

The society is now actively preparing costumes and arranging scenery. The costumes are budgeted for one thousand yuan, and Hu Xuguang, a costume expert from the former Lianhua Company, is designing and supervising the production. It is said that the four robes worn by the Empress Dowager Cixi alone cost more than three hundred yuan.

Since suffering from typhoid fever, Xu Xingzhi has been resting for nearly half a year. Recently, he has fully recovered and has gained weight compared to last year's "Christmas time", so he has accepted the responsibility of directing "Chen Yuanyuan". The Drama Art Society originally had two rehearsed plays, "Setting an Example" and "A Family of Liars", but the performance dates of these two plays may have to be postponed. "Chen Yuanyuan" is intended to follow "Motherland" and started rehearsing yesterday. As for the role of Chen Yuanyuan, it was originally decided to be played by Lan Lan, but in order to follow "Motherland", it has now been changed to Xia Yi. Yang Qi, who recently joined the Drama Art Society, is playing Wu Sangui.

Recently, many drama practitioners have jumped from the stage to the screen. For example, Jiang Ming and Tong Yi from the former Zhonglu have joined Xinhua, and Tan Guangyou and Ge Xin, who once appeared on the stage of the Lafayette Theatre, have now officially joined Yihua. Tu Guangqi and Chen Qi from the Drama Art Society have also joined Hezong.

Soon, Shanghai will have an amateur drama society focusing on research. It is said that the first play to be performed will be Tolstoy's original work "Resurrection".

### First-Run National Film Theaters New Films for New Year's Day

It is heard that the new films that Shanghai Guang, Jincheng, and Xinguang, three movie theaters specializing in first-run domestic films, have decided to present on New Year's Day are "Ge Nenniang's Martyrdom", "Fei Zhen'e Assassinating the Tiger", and "The Legend of the White Snake".

"Ge Nenniang's Martyrdom" is directed by Zhang Shankun himself, with Gu Lanjun playing Nenniang and Mei Xi playing Ke Xian. Most of the other roles are played by the original stage actors. About seven or eight of the scenes have already been shot, and they are working hard day and night in the past few days to finish shooting before the end of the year. "Fei Zhen'e Assassinating the Tiger" is directed by Li Pingqian and is the fourth famous work by Chen Yunshang after coming to Shanghai. It has almost all been shot. "The Legend of the White Snake" is directed by Yang Xiaozhong, with Chen Yanyan playing Bai Niangniang, Tong Yuejuan playing Xiao Qingqing, and Sun Min playing Xu Xian. They are now reshooting a few remaining shots and will be finished completely within a few days.

Several Patrons of Actors from the Banking World

But I now particularly want to bring up two bigwigs from a certain major bank. While they certainly support actors with great power, the actors being supported by these two often give them the cold shoulder. Sometimes they are even given marching orders by the actors and kicked out the door (this is from the opera, whether it's accurate or not is up for debate). But, surprisingly, they don't care at all. If they're turned away today, they'll come back tomorrow. One is obsessed with art, the other is infatuated with beauty. No wonder people often say, "Gold has a price, but art is priceless," and also, "Beauty can topple cities and nations." Judging from the various anecdotes involving these banking bigwigs and certain famous actors, we can understand that the value of art cannot be estimated with numbers. As for the issue of beauty, that's another matter entirely, because art and beauty fundamentally cannot be compared.

Speaking of the surnames of these two bankers, they share surnames with two of the four guards of Bao Qingtian, the magistrate of Kaifeng Prefecture. These two gentlemen are not only in the same bank but also of nearly equal status. Let's talk first about the one obsessed with art. With his lofty status and control over economic power, he certainly cannot be subdued by ordinary actors. This artist, needless to say, is none other than Yu Shuyan, the foremost actor in the Pear Garden today. I have talked a lot about Shuyan before, and I have also briefly described his financial and family situation. The reason why he is unwilling to take on the role again is, of course, due to his frequent illnesses, but in reality, it is also because he has become accustomed to living a life of luxury and comfort. Furthermore, the banker's condescending teaching, his meticulous flattery, and his almost celestial praise have inevitably increased his arrogance considerably. (161)
