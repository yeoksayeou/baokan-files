### Although Japan Publicly Declares Intent to Invade Southwest and Northwest China, A Major War is Unlikely in the Short Term; Japanese Troops are Exhausted Dealing with Chinese Guerrillas; China is Working Hard to Recover Lost Territory; Hope for Increased Chinese Troops in Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces

(Hong Kong) Military experts judge that although the Japanese army has publicly declared its intent to invade southwest and northwest China, a major war is unlikely to occur in the short term. The Japanese army is currently focusing on dealing with Chinese guerrilla warfare on the north bank of the Yellow River. The Japanese army has two divisions in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, two divisions between the Pinghan Railway and the Tongpu Railway, a regiment from a division and a garrison brigade in Shandong, and a total of two divisions in Chahar and Suiyuan. The "21st" Division is deployed in Kaifeng to deal with nearby guerrillas. The Japanese army in Hainan totals one division, including one regiment from the 5th Division, the Taiwan Army's Hata Regiment, and three marine corps units. (28th dispatch)

(Hong Kong) The authorities are working hard to strengthen the work of counter-attacking lost territory. In addition to Shi Yousan's troops joining the effort in North China, another capable force has been sent to reinforce them, all under the command of Lu Zhonglin. Chinese troops in Jiangsu and Shandong have also increased, all under the command of Yu Xuezhong. The Eighth Route Army has advanced to Rehe and is heading straight for Northeast China. It is absolutely impossible for the Japanese to make further progress. (28th, 9 PM dispatch)

(Hong Kong) There have been no changes in the fighting in northwestern Guangdong's Beijiang River area this week.

Additional large units will be dispatched to try to occupy the Chaozhou highway and cut off Chinese military transportation lines. Another 3,000 have been transferred to Zengcheng, becoming part of a large force that will head towards Heyuan. (28th, 9 PM dispatch)

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army in the Dongjiang River area is currently launching a fierce eastward attack in two directions.

Conservative Member of Parliament Graham then asked whether the Prime Minister would instruct Ambassador Craigie in Japan to urge the Japanese government to provide a more detailed explanation of its excuse for occupying Hainan Island due to military necessity, and to clarify the conditions under which it considered such military necessity to have ended.

### The War in Central Hubei Turns Tense; Japanese Troops Intensify Westward Advance from Wuhan; Attempt to Occupy Jingmen and Anlu; Yichang and Shashi are also Targets; Chinese Troops Achieve Favorable Results in Counterattack at Sanyangdian

(Chongqing) According to Chinese reports, during this week, the Japanese army intensified its westward advance from Wuhan, attempting to occupy Jingmen and Anlu in Hubei. According to rumors last night, the Japanese army had already occupied Jingmen last night. However, according to the Chinese military, the Japanese army has only advanced to Jiukou and Jingshan on the Hanshui River. The purpose of this Japanese offensive is clearly to cut off the transportation line between Xiangyang and Shashi. The ultimate goal of the Japanese army is to occupy Yichang and Shashi. Shashi is an important transportation hub. After the Japanese army occupies Yichang, it can be used as an air base, making it easier to bomb Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and other cities in western China. However, the Yichang airport is quite small, and it would need to be rebuilt if Japanese bombers were to land there. (28th, Associated Press dispatch)

Jingmen, Yingcheng, and Zao City are currently areas where Japanese forces are concentrated. The main direction of the Japanese army is still undecided, as the advanced units of the Japanese army have all run into obstacles. Yesterday, fierce fighting occurred on the Sanyangdian, Jingshan, Yonglong River, and Yuekou lines, especially in the Luohanling area. The Chinese army launched a fierce counterattack in the Sanyangdian area and achieved considerable success. A certain Chinese army launched an attack on the area where the Japanese army was most vulnerable, and the Japanese army has been seriously threatened. On the main front, the Chinese and Japanese armies are facing each other more than 30 miles east of Shayang. Yesterday, the Chinese army rapidly deployed its forces and occupied all the advantageous positions. It is expected that significant gains will be made in the battle results within a day or two.

### The Rumored Japanese "Kita Peace Plan"

What is most likely to give people an extremely strong stimulus is: In days of peace, nothing is more shocking than bloody swords and flashing lights; in times of war, nothing is more shocking than rumors of peace. This is inevitable in human nature, cannot be concealed, and is a matter of course, so there is no need to avoid it. China's war of resistance against Japan will soon reach its twentieth month. Although the government and the people are working hard, and morale is high, mindful of the survival of the nation, they are striving for final victory. With a stubborn enemy in front of them, they are bound by duty and will not turn back, enduring all kinds of difficulties and not seeking temporary ease. However, whenever they hear talk of peace negotiations, they always want to investigate their origins, distinguish their true nature, discern their content, and examine their truth. This is also a constant human emotion and matter of course, which one cannot help but do. As reported the day before yesterday, a dispatch from the American Associated Press in Chongqing, and yesterday, a dispatch from the German Haitong News Agency in London, both concerned talk of peace. Regardless of how those discussing it react psychologically, it is certain that readers will not casually let it pass. This can be asserted.

The two dispatches differ in their origins and main points, but both take the so-called peace plan of Japanese Major General Kita as the sole source of information. However, the Chongqing dispatch refuted it, while the British dispatch focused on its interpretation. The reporter is ignorant and has no opportunity to see the actual appearance of the Kita Plan. However, based on the Chongqing and British dispatches, one can glean the plan's content, which has six points: First, Japan expresses respect for the Three Principles of the People as the basis for Sino-Japanese peace; second, the peace process will no longer rely on the puppet organization or puppet regime in Beiping, but China and Japan will hold direct negotiations; third, the Chinese government after peace will still be called the "Kuomintang Government," and Wang Jingwei will be allowed to be its chairman; fourth, the "downfall" and "overthrow" of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will no longer be pursued, and he will be invited to participate in the so-called "Kuomintang Government" and hold prominent positions; fifth, if the National Government agrees to these conditions, Japan will withdraw its Japanese troops from Central and Southern China, but will still station troops in North China; sixth, Japan will cooperate with foreign countries mediating the peace negotiations to jointly develop the economy of North China. According to the Chongqing dispatch, an official in Chongqing refuted this Kita Plan, stating that the invitation to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was an absolute insult. He also exposed the Japanese so-called Kuomintang and Three Principles of the People as nothing more than borrowed names, used to deceive and swindle, and another trick to make the party and the country exist only in name. Furthermore, he revealed that this was the same as the rumors that have been circulating for months about Japan plotting to organize a so-called "New Kuomintang." The official's views and refutations are shared by everyone.

After analyzing the two dispatches, the reporter learned that what Kita and his group hoped for were the six points mentioned above, and also felt that Kita and his group were actually one step ahead of Konoe and those he represented. Konoe and those he represented are anesthetizing themselves by deceiving their own people, believing that the military invasion has been quite successful, that China is about to surrender, and that they can use the power of their supposed victory to cover up their impending failure. They expect China to stop resisting and accept the terms of national subjugation, pretending to be a victor. Kita's attitude is slightly different. He knows that the war cannot be won and that the Three Principles of the People and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek are factors in stabilizing China. Therefore, he is attempting to steal the sky and replace the sun, believing that by slightly modifying his hideous face, his ambitions may be realized, his conspiracies may be sold, and China may be caught. However, he is wrong. The reporter deeply laments that Japanese authorities on China, such as Kita, are so backward in their thinking, so disconnected from the Chinese situation, and so ignorant of the general concepts of the Chinese people in recent years. Therefore, the reporter is even more convinced that unless Japan is completely defeated, plunging itself into an irretrievable state, it will never repent, nor will there be any hope of reaching a compromise to resolve the war and stabilize the Far East. Thus, the reporter can boldly assert that China achieving final victory through a protracted war of resistance is the most convenient way to resolve the war and stabilize the Far East. There is no shortcut.

The Kita Plan either harbors malicious intentions, hoping to trick China, or Kita's understanding is insufficient. Judging from his intentions, he probably believes that the Chinese people only pay lip service to the Three Principles of the People, the Central Government, and national sovereignty, and can be manipulated by others, stealing and replacing their substance. He probably believes that the Chinese people only respect Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's position, rather than being loyal, enthusiastic, and supporting him as their only leader. He probably believes that the people once admired, no matter how foolish they are now, or how absurd their behavior, there is still room to find ways to get the Chinese people to blindly admire them again. He probably believes that the leader whom the Chinese people support and love is interested in profit, and can be lured by the fame and position of "Eastern goods." If he does not have such insufficient understanding, how can he have such a plan for the desired peace!

Of course, the Japanese side's ideas may not be the same as China's. Therefore, conditions that China deems unacceptable may be the ones Japan is putting forward sincerely, believing it cannot continue the war and cannot win. As for Kita's plans, although his understanding may be insufficient, how can we know that he is not being very sincere? This is also an acceptable assumption, but it is not enough to provide evidence. If it is true, they should first withdraw their troops from Central and Southern China, and then talk about principles and conditions!

### Local News: Latest Developments

Although the demands made by the Japanese authorities in this port to the Shanghai Municipal Council last Wednesday have not yet been announced, the Council's response to the Japanese side on Saturday evening was published in Tokyo yesterday, containing the following five points:

(1) The Shanghai Municipal Police will continue to carefully prevent anti-Japanese terrorism in accordance with the emergency orders issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council in July 1938.

(2) The Shanghai Municipal Council welcomes the cooperation of the Japanese Consular Police and the Japanese military police in protecting the International Settlement to prevent terrorism. However, the methods of such cooperation will be decided by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese police through detailed discussions.

(3) These efforts will continue as before. Chinese people entering and leaving the Settlement, especially those passing through the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek, will continue to be searched.

(4) As in the past, the search of Chinese people at key points in the International Settlement will be intensified.

(5) Vacancies for Japanese personnel in the Shanghai Municipal Police will be filled as soon as suitable candidates are found.

It is reported that the new note sent by the Japanese authorities to the Shanghai Municipal Council at 4:05 p.m. yesterday in response to the above-mentioned proposals of the Council will not be published before the Shanghai Municipal Council's Board of Directors meets to discuss it. At that time, Japanese Consul General Miura and the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, held talks in Mr. Fessenden's office in the Council for 15 minutes. When the meeting broke up, both sides seemed quite optimistic. Afterwards, someone asked a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council about the situation of the meeting. The official was unwilling to make any statement and could not predict when the Shanghai Municipal Council's Board of Directors would meet to discuss the new note from the Japanese side.

According to news received yesterday by foreigners in this port from Tokyo, the Japanese side's demands on the Shanghai Municipal Council in the new note are more moderate than expected. The Japanese government is quite inclined to accept the Council's proposals. It is generally expected that the situation will not escalate and the turmoil will gradually subside. However, everything depends on the Council's implementation of the proposals. The Japanese Foreign Ministry consulted with other ministries yesterday and then sent a new instruction to Miura, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, ordering him to send the new note to the Shanghai Municipal Council. The document contains three key points (the same as those listed in the local news column) and states that the Council should clarify certain points in its proposals.

(Geneva) According to official announcements, President Azana of the Spanish Republican Government has formally resigned. Azana's letter to Parliament Speaker Baliver explained the reasons for his resignation, stating that since the General Staff believes that failure is inevitable, he supports a quick ceasefire. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

Golonge Town, Savoy Province, France: President Azana of the Spanish Republican Government recently submitted his resignation to Mr. Baliver, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and his brother-in-law, Mr. Livas, read the full text to reporters, stating, "After the military authorities informed me that there was no hope of victory in the war, I suggested to Prime Minister Negrin that peace talks be held with the Nationalists to avoid further bloodshed and casualties. Unfortunately, this was not possible. Until now, most countries, especially Britain and France, have recognized the Nationalist government as the legitimate government. From now on, I will be unable to entrust our diplomats to attempt peace talks. Moreover, since the domestic political institutions have been almost completely destroyed, even if I try to maintain the title of President and continue to serve, it is impossible in reality. Therefore, I submit my resignation to you." After reading the full text, Mr. Livas also said that if the constitution stipulates, Mr. Baliver should act as President in his capacity as Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Madrid: The leaders of the Republican government in Madrid and Valencia are now consulting on their future course of action. Prime Minister Negrin and Foreign Minister Alvarez are now in Valencia and will soon issue a statement on the government's views in Madrid. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

(Paris) Foreign affairs circles here recently stated that the Spanish Nationalist government has been formally recognized by Britain and France. From now on, although the country will not abandon its allies, Germany and Italy, it will not join the Anti-Comintern Pact, and its general foreign policy will not be manipulated by the Berlin-Rome axis. As the situation evolves, the country will likely promote friendly relations with Western European democracies. As far as the near future is concerned, if the Spanish Civil War cannot be ended immediately, Germany and Italy will continue to assist the Nationalists, but the Spanish people have no good feelings towards Italy, which is also a real situation. As for the future political system of Spain, the Nationalist government has its own unique features, which are very different from the fascist and national socialist systems, and may not be willing to imitate the omnipotent Germany and Italy in everything and be relegated to a "glorious third place." Moreover, once the civil war ends, Spain will be in commercial competition with Italy. From this point of view, it will also seek to promote economic relations with Britain and France. At that time, Italy will only be able to complain. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)

### A Heated Debate in the British House of Commons: Labor Party Members Impeach the Government; Prime Minister Chamberlain Announces Reasons for Recognition; Opposition Members Shout "Shameful" in Unison

(London) At the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a speech announcing that Britain and France had recognized the Spanish Nationalist government as the legitimate government and explaining that there were two reasons for this move: firstly, the strategic needs of Britain and France, and secondly, the remnants of the Spanish government forces no longer had the ability to resist. Moreover, General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist forces, had provided assurances that he would maintain Spanish independence and sovereignty and that only those who had committed criminal offenses would be punished among the members of the Republican government.

When the Prime Minister spoke, members of the government party applauded and praised him, while members of the opposition party shouted "shameful" in unison. Communist member Gallacher even shouted, "This is another crime of betraying the democratic system." The opposition Labor Party also proposed a motion of no confidence in the government, which is scheduled for debate tomorrow. However, the British government's decision to recognize the Nationalist government has been notified by the Foreign Office to the Duke of Alba, the representative of the Nationalist government in Britain, and Sir Maurice Peterson, the representative stationed in Burgos, has been instructed to notify the Nationalist government that it will not be subject to any influence.

The following is a summary of the Prime Minister's speech and the questions raised by members of the opposition parties: The Prime Minister said, "The government has made a thorough study of the situation in Spain and the actions we should take in light of various circumstances. We know that after the Nationalist government occupied Barcelona and captured Catalonia, it has already controlled most of the country's territory, and the industrial centers and the largest sources of wealth are also in the hands of the Nationalists. Even if the Republican government continues to resist in the south, it will only lead to more bloodshed and casualties and may not be of any benefit. In addition, the various organs of the Republican government are scattered in various places and cannot exercise their functions in the name of the central government. The British government has therefore decided to recognize the Nationalist government as the legitimate government of Spain and issued a formal notice today. At the same time, the French government should also take the same action today. In addition, General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist forces, has publicly announced that he himself and the Nationalist government have decided to maintain Spain's traditional independence and that he will only punish those who have committed criminal offenses among the members of the Republican government. The British government is very satisfied to hear this." At this point, Major Attlee, leader of the opposition Labor Party, asked when the government had decided to recognize the Nationalist government. Prime Minister Chamberlain refused to answer on the grounds that this question had not been notified in advance. However, Major Attlee still said that the Prime Minister had made a promise on the 14th of this month, stating that the government would notify the House of Commons as soon as possible before recognizing the Nationalist government. "Now the French people and the French House of Representatives have been notified, but the Prime Minister refuses to answer questions from members of this House. What is the reason? It is difficult to understand." The Prime Minister replied, "The situation is very simple. The Cabinet has decided to authorize me and the Foreign Secretary to recognize the Nationalist government when the time is right. The Foreign Secretary and I made the final decision at the end of last week. That's all." Major Attlee also said that it was reported that the British and French governments had consulted each other and that the British government had first decided to recognize the Nationalist government in order to facilitate Prime Minister Daladier's speech to the French House of Representatives on Friday without being criticized. Is this true? Prime Minister Chamberlain replied again, "I cannot be questioned on every minute detail." Before he could finish speaking, members of the opposition shouted, "You should be accused of being a traitor to Britain." Major Attlee also said that the Prime Minister had stated on February 23 that the government had not yet made a decision on the recognition of the Nationalist government. This was suspected of misleading the House of Commons. Prime Minister Chamberlain also replied that the situation was indeed like that at that time. Labor member Henderson asked again, "Is the recognition of the Nationalist government unconditional? Has the Nationalist government provided any guarantees that it will withdraw foreign volunteers?" The Prime Minister replied, "The government has indeed obtained such guarantees, but the recognition is unconditional." At this point, Major Attlee interjected, "The Spanish Republican government is a member of the League of Nations. Does the recognition of the Nationalist government mean that the Republican government is not recognized?" The Prime Minister replied, "This is inevitable." The Labor Party then proposed a motion of no confidence, stating, "The Spanish rebels are fighting with foreign aid, and the British government is now recognizing them, which is intentionally disregarding the legitimate government of a friendly country and violating international practice. The confidence and goodwill of democratic countries towards Britain will also be affected by this." The Prime Minister agreed to debate this motion tomorrow. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)

### After French Government Recognition, Maintaining Amicable Relations with Spain, Preparing to Return Spanish National Assets; Candidate for First Ambassador Undecided

(Paris) The Foreign Ministry recently issued a statement saying, "Mr. Peyrouton, the French special envoy, held talks with General Jordana, the Foreign Minister of the Spanish Nationalist government, in Burgos some time ago, which were very harmonious. An agreement has been reached on various issues. The French government is now preparing to assist the Nationalist government in recovering the Spanish national assets held in France. In addition, both sides have expressed their determination to maintain amicable and good-neighborly relations." The Spanish Nationalist government has issued the same statement in Burgos. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)

(Paris) The cabinet held a cabinet meeting at 4 p.m. today, and unanimously decided to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government as the legitimate government. Prime Minister Daladier then reported on the negotiations between Senator Peyrouton of the right wing and General Jordana, the Foreign Minister of the Spanish Nationalist government, and the contents of the agreements reached between the two sides. The cabinet decided to commend Mr. Peyrouton because his mission had been completed. After Mr. Bonnet, the Foreign Minister, reported on the general situation of diplomacy, the meeting was adjourned. It was decided to hold a meeting on March 2 to decide on the candidate for the first ambassador to the Spanish Nationalist government. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)

(Paris) Regarding the candidate for the first ambassador, the government originally preferred Senator Peyrouton of the right wing, but he has declined. Other highly regarded candidates include General Giraud, General Catroux, and General Doumenc (all members of the Supreme Defense Committee) among the generals, and Ambassador Berthelot to Argentina and Ambassador Noël to Poland among the diplomats. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)

Burgos: The agreement signed between France and Burgos before the official recognition of the Franco government has been announced. In order to establish good relations with Spain, France promises (1) to return all Spanish property stored in France, (2) to suppress all activities opposing Nationalist Spain. The first item includes the reserves stored in the Central Bank of France, as well as military supplies, ships, vehicles, pearls, gems, valuable works of art, and banknotes, bonds, and stocks stored in France. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)

(Paris) After the French cabinet announced its decision to recognize the Nationalist government as the legitimate government of Spain yesterday, political figures and public opinion did not express surprise. However, government officials pointed out that France's change of policy towards Spain has encountered very significant difficulties. Two weeks ago, the French government sent a letter to Franco regarding four conditions for formal recognition: (1) amnesty for domestic enemies in Spain, (2) withdrawal of Italian volunteers in Spain, (3) guarantee that Spain will adopt a completely independent foreign policy, and (4) resignation or dissolution of the Republican government. Now that France has suddenly formally recognized, it is not yet known whether the above conditions have been agreed upon. If it causes a debate in the House of Representatives in the future, the opposition party, which accounts for 45% of the seats, will definitely use this to attack Daladier. Left-wing figures strongly stated that France's recognition of the Nationalist government has caused France's loyalty to its treaty obligations to be greatly doubted. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)

### Berlin Welcomes: German-Italian Policy Achieves Victory

(Berlin) A German spokesman today described the news of Britain's recognition of General Franco as, "Recognition, though late, is better than no recognition. We sincerely welcome this news without any criticism. Spain is a part of Europe, and any event that helps to solve the Spanish problem will be welcomed by those who care about European peace." (Reuters dispatch from the 27th)

(Berlin) Political figures in Berlin believe that the recognition of the Nationalist government by Britain and France is not only a victory for General Franco and his troops, but also a diplomatic victory for Germany and Italy. They firmly believe that the new Spain will pursue its traditional military and foreign policies and become a new important country in the Mediterranean. Political figures also believe that the attempts by Western democratic countries to win over Spain will inevitably fail in the future. The "Berlin Evening News" stated that Britain and France have always believed that Spain has been weakened by this long civil war, and at the appropriate time, the Non-Intervention Committee can mediate, and Britain and France can use political, economic, and social means to deepen British and French influence in Spain. However, the fact is that this civil war in Spain has completely changed the country's social life and established the Falange political system. As for developing economic undertakings, experts and consultants can be provided by true friendly countries to achieve success. There is no need for democratic countries to provide money. The newspaper added that the Non-Intervention Committee can stop its work, because General Franco can now handle the country's problems single-handedly. The "German General Newspaper" also stated in a sarcastic tone that President Roosevelt can now send his recognition telegram to Burgos. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)

Lithuanian Capital: The Lithuanian Cabinet decided to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government in the shortest possible time. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)

### United States Watching Spanish Situation: Policy Unclear, Recognition Still Pending

(Washington) Today, US Secretary of State Hull stated that the United States, after British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced Britain's recognition of General Franco, is considering various possibilities regarding the recognition issue, but has not yet reached a state where it can be announced. According to the general impression of various well-informed sources here, the United States will eventually follow Britain and France in recognizing the Nationalist regime, but will try to avoid giving the impression of being too hasty. It is said that there are two reasons why the United States wants to hesitate slightly before recognizing the Nationalist regime: (1) Washington is now paying attention to observing what policies General Franco will adopt towards South American countries that are culturally linked to Spain. If he starts any fascist propaganda attempts in South America, it will arouse the hostility of the United States. (2) The US government now urgently wants to know how General Franco will treat his compatriots whose power has been eliminated. If Mr. Franco takes cruel revenge on the leaders and sympathizers of the Republican government, the American people will have strong emotions and advocate not recognizing General Franco.

### Autocratic Countries' Arrogance Soaring: United States Should Strengthen Defense; Senate Heatedly Debates Air Force Expansion Plan; Chairman of Military Committee Supports President's Plan

(Washington) Today, when the Senate began debating the government's proposed $358 million Air Force and Army rearmament fund, Senator Sheppard, Chairman of the Senate Military Committee, mentioned the hostile attitude of certain dictatorships and imperialist countries. It is said that his opinion is based on President Roosevelt's recent message to Congress, believing that the United States' military power must be expanded immediately so that the Air Force will reach a total of 6,000 aircraft by 1941. We cannot draw a defense line on the maritime and land borders of the United States and say that we will only defend this. It must be known that the Panama Canal, Puerto Rico, and Alaska are all important links in our national defense chain. If these military areas are occupied by the enemy, the security of the United States will be in danger. If the Panama Canal becomes permanently or for a long time useless, the US Navy, under the current organization, will lose its position as the protector of its two oceans. Our current defense system will collapse as a result. We hope that there will never be a need for war to maintain the Monroe Doctrine and the freedom of the Western Hemisphere, but if we must go to war, swift action will be essential. Republican Senator Vandenberg demanded that Congress clearly explain the foreign policy of the United States before passing this bill, and said that the United States is bound to join an arms race, and in the future, the civilization of the country, even if it does not break down with war, will collapse due to bankruptcy. It is expected that the final vote on this bill will be taken tomorrow at the earliest. (Reuters dispatch from the 27th)

(Washington) According to information revealed tonight by Pennsylvania Democratic Representative Sider, the House Appropriations Committee has decided to recommend an appropriation of $500 million for the War Department next year. He said that in addition to appropriating $50 million for the purchase of 200 new fighter aircraft, another appropriation will be made to quickly build 565 aircraft as part of the effort to increase the Air Force strength in the Army. The most important item in the military appropriations bill is the plan to equip the regular army with semi-automatic rifles. It is expected that this move will double the strength of the US infantry. At the same time, Democratic Representative Shepphard of Texas opened a Senate debate on President Roosevelt's proposed $365,000,000 emergency national defense bill. He said that if the advantages of the President's proposal are not recognized, the results will be extremely dangerous. (Associated Press dispatch from the 27th)

### American Fir Wood Supplied to Totalitarian Countries: Lumber Merchants Protest to Government

Tacoma, USA: Foresters and lumber merchants here today unanimously protested to the US Congress regarding the US transporting fir wood to Germany, Italy, and Japan for the construction of aircraft. This protest has been sent to Washington, and its text also states that these three totalitarian countries consume as many as 100 million board feet of American fir wood each year.

### Soviet Expansion of Naval Power: Many Ships Completed

(Moscow) According to Nei Dixing, Director of the Political Department of the Soviet Red Army, the Soviet Union's heavy industry is now fully developed, so the construction of the navy can be completed in a short period. The number of battleships, submarines, and other warships completed last year was considerable. Two battleships have already sailed to Vladivostok, which is certainly related to the current tense situation between Russia and Japan due to fishing issues. (U.S. Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

### Soviet Attention to Agricultural Economy

Encouraging Farmers to Use Machinery

National Exhibition to be Held This Autumn

(Moscow) Snow has not yet melted in northern and central Soviet Union, but the south has already begun sowing grains according to the second-year program of the Third Five-Year Plan. The Soviet Union has become an industrial nation, accounting for 77% of the national economic structure, but the Party and government authorities still pay close attention to agricultural economic problems. The main approaches are twofold: (1) to promote the development of agricultural economy with the most advanced machinery, and (2) to encourage farmers to use machinery. The All-Soviet Agricultural Exhibition is scheduled to begin in August this year. At that time, the harvest situation of agricultural products in 1938 will be fully understood. All agricultural organizations can participate in this exhibition according to the established regulations. Those who pass the qualification will be awarded prizes or gold and silver medals to encourage them. The exhibition authorities have made 21,000 medals. (Dispatch of the 28th)

### Leningrad Built into a Strong Fortress, Covering 40,000 Square Miles, Defending Against Enemy Invasion from the North

Helsinki. According to news received here, Leningrad has become the world's strongest fortress after a recent large-scale fortification. According to the official announcement, the defense line included in the "Leningrad Fortress" covers an area of 40,000 square miles. Its goal is to protect against invasion from the north. A total of 15 cities have been fortified, and the total population within the defense zone is 4 million. It is reported that the Presidium of Leningrad and various Soviet districts has ordered the strict change of residence of these 4 million people, and construction of new houses within the area is prohibited without the permission of the military authorities. The large power stations on the Volkhov and Svir Rivers are all within this defense system. Two army corps soldiers and a special division of secret police are responsible for security in the area. It is said that the fortified area includes (1) the entire area between Lake Ladoga and the Svir River, to the Vitebsk district, (2) the Luga River around Lake Ladoga, (3) the coast of the Gulf of Finland, (4) Lake Peipus on the Estonian border.

### British Naval New Budget: 150 Million Pounds. Speeding Up Shipbuilding Program. Adding 10,000 Soldiers

(London) The naval portion of the next budget (i.e., 1939-40) has just been announced, totaling £153,666,000, an increase of £23,281,000 compared to this year (1938-39). The shipbuilding portion includes two battleships, one aircraft carrier, four cruisers, two flotillas of destroyers totaling sixteen ships, four submarines, twenty-two merchant escort ships, ten minesweepers, one minelayer, one supply ship, four gunboats, one shallow-draft gunboat, and five torpedo boats. In addition, King George VI's royal yacht "Victoria and Albert" is too old and should be rebuilt. Regarding the number of naval soldiers, the original quota of 119,000 has been increased by 14,000, totaling 133,000. Among them, 2,000 were recruited in September last year during the Czech crisis and should remain in service. The remaining 12,000 need to be recruited. The most interesting part of shipbuilding is the twenty-two merchant escort ships. These warships are inexpensive and are specifically used to escort merchant ships and defend against submarines. This is in response to Germany's increase in submarine tonnage to be on par with the UK, a clear tit-for-tat. The intention to build two flotillas of destroyers is also the same.

### British Government Raises National Defense Debt, House Passes Bill

(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon recently proposed a bill to increase the amount of national defense bonds, requesting permission for the government to increase the number of issued bonds from 400 million pounds to 800 million pounds. The opposition Labor Party also proposed an amendment, requesting that the number of issued bonds be reduced from 800 million pounds to 799.9 million pounds to express its opposition. The House of Commons continued its discussion today and immediately rejected the amendment proposed by the Labor Party and passed the second reading of Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon's original bill with 232 votes against 117. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Morrison (Minister for Coordination of Defence, Admiral Lord Chatfield) stated on behalf of the government that representatives of the general staffs of the UK and France are continuing talks.

### Belgian New Cabinet Stillborn: Austerity Policies Hit a Wall

Brussels. The cabinet of Belgian Catholic Party member Heymans failed just six days after its formation due to differences of opinion with the Social Democratic Party, and yesterday announced its resignation. Mr. Heymans has submitted his resignation to King Leopold III. It is not yet known whom the King will appoint to form a new cabinet. The immediate cause of this cabinet collapse was that the socialist ministers refused to support the proposal put forward by the Catholic cabinet members to reduce the salaries and pensions of civil servants by 5%, which led to Mr. Heymans' resignation.

### Germany Worried Poland Will Embrace Britain and France. Italian-Polish Talks Promote Political Understanding. Polish Government Presents Ciano with Medal

(Paris) Following days of anti-German demonstrations in Poland, the Daily News recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating, "Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, will travel to London or even Paris in the near future, which is causing anxiety in Berlin. Recently, the German and Polish governments have been working to promote closer relations. The reason why German newspapers have remained silent about the anti-German demonstrations in Poland is that they do not want to see this effort fail. Political figures in Berlin are well aware that Polish public opinion is largely opposed to Germany. Therefore, the German government wants to avoid any actions that could make the situation of the Polish government, especially Foreign Minister Beck, more difficult. This painstaking effort is not generally understood. If Foreign Minister Beck turns to Britain and France, Germany will truly have cause for both laughter and tears." (Havas dispatch of the 28th)

Warsaw. The Polish government has recently awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the White Eagle to Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. (Havas dispatch of the 28th)

(Rome) Guido, the editor-in-chief of "Italian News," recently published an article in the newspaper commenting on Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Warsaw. He said that from a political point of view, Foreign Minister Ciano's trip did not involve discussing or concluding any agreements with Poland, but only clarifying each other's positions. Guido said that the Polish government's friendly understanding of the objectives of the German-Italian axis is noteworthy, as this attitude has an important factor: the Polish government, while adhering to its alliance with France, will not allow itself to become a political tool against Germany and Italy. This shows that the Polish government is determined to maintain the independence of its foreign policy and does not want to be used politically by other countries. The French "Le Temps" previously stated that the Polish government does not need to rely on Germany and Italy in the Danube region and can occupy its leading position. Guido said that this statement cannot represent the views of Polish officials. In practice, Poland's policy in the Danube region is only possible with the cooperation of the Axis countries or other Danube countries. Guido concluded his article by saying that Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Poland assured the diplomatic relations between the two countries and clarified their views. This result can be proved by future developments. (Haitong dispatch of the 28th)

(Berlin) The German News Agency Warsaw dispatch stated that about 100 Polish students in Krakow marched towards the German consulate tonight to protest but were stopped by police equipped with tear gas, fire hoses, and rubber batons, and they dispersed. (Reuters dispatch of the 27th)

Warsaw. German and Polish students at the Danzig Free City Arts School had another serious conflict today. After several German students insulted Polish students, they were sent to the police station for detention until the Polish High Commissioner to the Free City of Danzig, Chodacki, intervened and they were released. The Polish government has requested that the Danzig City Council close the Arts School and stated that if these disturbances are ignored, it will easily lead to serious consequences, and the responsibility should be borne by the Danzig authorities. (Havas dispatch of the 27th)

Warsaw. Today, an official statement was issued here stating that if the Danzig Art School does not restore order, Poland will have to take appropriate action. The statement did not indicate what action would be taken if a satisfactory answer was not received, but it is generally believed that it will take the form of retaliation against German students in Poland or expelling them from Polish universities. Poland has also requested that the art school be closed. This statement is related to the recent riots between Polish and German students in Danzig. (Reuters dispatch of the 27th)

Danzig. The Vice-President of the Senate of the Free City of Danzig, Hoser, yesterday met with the Polish diplomatic representative in Danzig and made an oral statement that in order to maintain good relations between Poland and Danzig, the Polish government should express its disapproval of the resolutions issued by Polish students in Danzig.

### Hitler Allegedly to Propose Peace Suggestions, Establish Disarmament and Non-Aggression Pacts, Conditional on Satisfying Colonial Demands

(London) The "Daily Express" correspondent in Berlin stated that according to news from a senior official in the German government, Hitler's policy now has a surprising new change. It is said that Germany is now preparing to propose an agreement to limit armaments and a non-aggression pact that guarantees European peace for 25 or 50 years. The above will be part of the overall solution to the situation, and the colonial issue will also be an integral part of it. According to the correspondent, Mr. Hitler's new policy will require Britain and France to unconditionally abandon "all colonies built on lies" and recognize Germany's right to occupy these colonies. Assuming that all of the above can be fulfilled, Mr. Hitler will be prepared to accept other colonies in place of Germany's former colonies, subject to the consent of the mandated powers. The correspondent concluded that Germany is even prepared to enter into a general treaty on the abolition of submarines and bombers. (Reuters dispatch of the 28th)

### Italian Territorial Demands on France to Proceed Through Diplomatic Channels, Negotiations with France to Begin

(London) According to the Berlin correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph," Mussolini is now likely to pursue his demands to France through diplomatic channels rather than through public speeches. The newspaper reported that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had an hour-long conversation with the Italian ambassador to Germany yesterday, probably to discuss Italy's demands on France. According to reliable sources, the official announcement of the demands has been postponed again, and it is unlikely to be published in the next two weeks. (Reuters dispatch of the 28th)

### Franco Boasts of Military Achievements

Burgos. After the formal recognition of Franco by Britain and France was announced last night, General Franco delivered a speech to the masses from the balcony of his official residence, declaring, "Spaniards can be proud of Spaniards again today." Mr. Franco continued to say that the Spanish army is stronger today than ever before and that he is honored to be the leader of this army. "Some Spanish embassies abroad, which a few days ago still called us rebels, have now hoisted the flag of the National Army. Countries that previously had a hesitant wait-and-see attitude, now see the defeat of the Red Army and are rushing to recognize us. Yesterday Argentina, today Britain and France, these recognitions are the natural result of our heroic battles. In this situation, we are all the more reminded of the three friendly powers, Portugal, Germany, and Italy, who have unconditionally supported us since the beginning of the war."

### Construction of Yunnan-Burma and Xuyong-Kunming Railways: Kunming-Xuanwei Section Scheduled to Open This Year, Alignment Work on Both Lines is in Progress, 30 Mountain Excavators Will Arrive Soon

Yunnan Correspondence. Yunnan is located on the extreme frontier, bordering French Indochina and British Burma to the south and west respectively. Its importance is self-evident.

Accelerating Railway Construction, Opening in Sections

In order to form a southwest transportation network and connect international relations, the central government has successively established the Yunnan-Burma and Xuyong-Kunming Railway Engineering Bureaus, appointing Shen Chang and Sa Fu as the directors of the two bureaus. The groundbreaking ceremony was formally held in Wangqiying, Kunming County, last month. As the reporter believes that the two railways are of great importance to national construction, I will specially report on the recent situation of the two railways. The calls for the two railways date back to the Qing Dynasty, starting with the Yunnan-Burma Road, as seen in Xue Fucheng's memorial. As for the Yunnan-Sichuan Railway, a company was organized to raise shares as early as the late Qing Dynasty Guangxu period, and engineers had also been hired, but it was delayed for a long time and never materialized. Now, after a year and a half of the Anti-Japanese War, construction has officially started. The Yunnan-Burma Railway was ordered to be organized in June last year, the survey team set off in early July, and the office was officially established in Kunming on August 22. The Xuyong-Kunming Railway was ordered slightly later, and the office was established in Kunming on September 20, and the survey team also set off at the same time. At present, the reconnaissance work has been completed for both routes, the preliminary survey work has been completed 45% for Yunnan-Burma and 20% for Xuyong-Kunming, and the alignment work has been completed 25% for Yunnan-Burma and 15% for Xuyong-Kunming. It is expected that by the end of March next year, the alignment work of both routes can be completed. According to the survey, the length of the main line is 773 kilometers for Yunnan-Burma and 774 kilometers for Xuyong-Kunming. The places through which they pass are: the Yunnan-Burma route passes through Anning, Lufeng, Guangtong, Chuxiong, Zhennan, Yao'an, Yunnanyi, Midu, Nanjian, Yunxian, Menglai, Mengding, to reach Nanda. The Xuyong-Kunming Railway passes through Malong, Qujing, Yiwei, Weining, Yiliang, and Yanjin to reach Xufu, Sichuan. Although there are as many as 151 tunnels on both routes, the study found that the length of each tunnel does not exceed 500 meters. Currently, 30 mountain excavators have been ordered for both routes and will arrive in China within a few months. Explosives and detonating cords have been ordered, and the Yunnan provincial authorities are also providing as much locally-made gunpowder as possible for mountain excavation. In this way, it should be able to proceed smoothly. As for bridges, only the Lancang River Bridge is the longest, with a bridge span of about 120 meters in total length. The bridge span of other bridges will be about 50 meters. Because there are many dry bridges crossing mountains, the estimated cost of materials for both routes is about 200 million yuan, of which about 2 million pounds are foreign materials. The government's existing materials and the funds raised have exceeded 1 million pounds. This 1 million pounds does not include any national loans. In terms of construction funds, the Yunnan and Sichuan provincial governments are responsible for investing 5 million yuan each, and the central government has a special construction fund with a budget that is issued monthly as scheduled. Chairman Chiang and President Kong pay special attention to the two routes and provide the strongest maintenance. As for the construction funds required, there is no need to worry about shortage. The price for people's land, stone, and wood materials will also be fairly given. Based on the above, since there are no technical problems and there are solutions for construction materials and funds, it can be completed successfully in a matter of days. The two routes will be completed within two and a half years after construction starts. It is expected that the section from Kunming to Xuanwei will be open to traffic in August 1939, the section to Weining will be open to traffic in 1940, and Kunming will be directly connected to Xufu in April 1941.

All Highways in Yunnan Province Will Be Completed

The most important highways in Yunnan Province are the east, west, and south routes. The east route runs from Kunming to Pingyi and reaches Guizhou, the west route runs from Kunming to Longling and exits to Burma, and the south route runs from Kunming via Mengzi to Boyi and exits to Guangxi. During the reign of Governor Yuan Pinzhen in Yunnan in 1921, the Third Brigade was ordered to build roads using military labor. The section from Kunming to Anning had already started construction, but was suspended due to the dispatch of troops to the Northern Expedition. After 1927, when Long Yun took charge of Yunnan, he ordered Director Zhang of the Construction Department to establish the Highway Administration, with Long Yun as the Director and Zhang as the Associate Director. After several years of work, many roads were built. In the past two or three years, Chairman Long believed that the east and west routes were of great importance and had to be completed as soon as possible. He then established the Highway Administration independently, appointing Lu Jieqing as the Director and Yang Jinghan as the Associate Director, and strictly ordered them to actively build the roads and set a deadline for completion. Last year, the 970-kilometer-long Yunnan-Burma Highway was completed and opened to traffic. Since the outbreak of the war, Yunnan Province has become an important rear base, completing the rear transportation network. The highways planned to be built in Yunnan Province this year are listed below. A. Provincial highways that urgently need to be completed include (1) the Yizhao Section (from Xuanwei via Weining in Guizhou to Sichuan and then to Zhaotong via Yiwei to Zhaotong, with a total length of 295 kilometers). This section is of great importance to southwest transportation, so the Supreme Leader recently telegraphed to quickly complete it. Associate Director Yang Shisheng is still in Yiwei supervising the construction. This road should have been completed last year, but due to the unrest in Weining, the civilians could not carry out the work. The paving project from Xuanwei to the border of Yunnan and Guizhou has been completed, and only scattered projects remain unfinished in Guizhou Province, which are expected to be completed soon. Secondly, the Zhaotong section is also under construction. (2) The Lukai Section (from Lunan to Kaiyuan). This section will be completed this month. (3) The Kaibo Section (from Kaiyuan via Yanshan to Boai, with a total length of 490 kilometers and 100 meters). The section from Kaiyuan to Yanshan will be completed by the end of the month, and the section directly to Boai will be actively completed in the future. Most of this section of dirt road has been completed in order to connect with the highway of Baise in Guangxi. (4) The Kaige Section (from Kaiyuan to Gejiu, 78 kilometers long). This section will be open to traffic this month, and the project from Kaiyuan to Mengzi is also being actively promoted. B. Provincial highways that are currently being actively built include (1) the Exin Section (from Eshan to Xinzhen), 184 kilometers long. (2) The Xinnin Section (from Xinping to Ninger, 359 kilometers and 240 meters long). (3) The Dali Section (from Dali to Lijiang), 180 kilometers and 16 meters long. The above three sections of highways are of great importance to the development of culture and industry in western and southern Yunnan. The Highway Administration had planned to open them up long ago, but due to various reasons, construction has only just begun. (4) The Wuyuan Section (from Wuding to Yuanmou) is also under construction. C. In order to develop transportation between Sichuan and Yunnan and between Yunnan and Burma, the Highway Administration is now planning to survey the highway line from Yuanmou to the south bank of the Jinsha River and from Baoshan (or Longling) via Tengchong to Bhamo in Burma, and has submitted it to the provincial government for approval. Among the county roads that will be completed soon are (1) Kunming to Fumin, (2) Xiangyun to Binchuan, and (3) Binchuan to Yongsheng. The county roads planned to be surveyed include (1) Guangnan to Funing and (2) Guangnan to Boai. As for the county roads of Yuxi, Hexi, Tonghai, Jiangchuan, Huaning, etc., the bureau has ordered them to be constructed separately. Other county roads will be surveyed and constructed as needed based on the actual situation.

### After Japanese Troops Occupy Hainan Island, Chinese Troops Strengthen Southern Defense. Bai Chongxi Visits Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing, Returns to Guilin

Guilin Correspondence. The defense of the southern coastal areas is entrusted to the Fifth Route Army. Haikou on Hainan Island and Xuwen on the southern route are separated only by a strait. They face each other across the sea, and the smoke from cooking fires can be seen. It takes about two hours to cross the sea by sailboat, and it is a matter of moments by boat. Haikou is about 130 nautical miles from Beihai, which is under Hepu jurisdiction, about 75 nautical miles from Guangzhou Bay, and about 150 kilometers from Anpu Port. The distances are not far. After the news of the Japanese troops landing on Hainan Island reached Guilin, Commander Bai Chongxi of the Southwest Military Council happened to return to Guilin from Kunming. On that day, Bai summoned senior generals of the Military Council to secretly discuss countermeasures. Subsequently, there was an urgent telegram from Chongqing to Bai, urging him to go to Chongqing. The next day, Bai flew to Chongqing again by plane, having been summoned to Chongqing by order of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for important military discussions. Afterwards, Director Bai returned to Guilin. According to sources, the Southwest Military Council's response to the Hainan incident included (1) launching a large-scale guerrilla war on the entire island of Hainan, giving full authority to Garrison Commander Wang Yih and Wu Daonan, the Ninth District Commissioner, to command military affairs on the entire island; (2) strengthening the strength of the southern regions, actively organizing people's self-defense teams, distributing guerrilla areas, equipping defense works, increasing regular troops, and organizing transportation; (3) implementing a scorched earth policy, evacuating coastal residents and coastal fishing boats, prohibiting their exports, and restricting the amount of food storage in the war zone. All of the above matters were decided by the Military Council and communicated to the generals of the two routes for implementation. Since February 15, Mo Shujie, Garrison Commander of Qinlian and Commander of a certain division of the Fifth Route Army, has declared special martial law on the key points along the coast, and the inspection of ships entering and leaving the port is extremely strict. The headquarters of the Fifth Route Army has also transported some mechanized troops and some new heavy artillery to Nanning and stationed them in key locations. After the Southwest Military Council strengthened the entire deployment of the southern regions, it would not be easy for the Japanese army to use Hainan as a base. Moreover, if the Japanese army wanted to occupy Guangxi, it would have to take the southern route as an entry point. However, although the southern route borders Guangxi, it is mountainous and forested. If the Japanese army takes the southern route, they will have to turn to mountain warfare, which is their most unfavorable situation. For this reason, the Japanese fleet lingered and looked around on the southern coast and never dared to land, but turned to seize Hainan to wait for an opportunity to spy on the southwest. Based on this judgment, although the Japanese army now occupies Hainan, it is unlikely to invade the southern route in the short term.

### Recovering the Great Bridge by the Northern Jiangsu Chinese Army

Japanese Troops Demand Cash Before Leaving

Taixian Correspondence: The Japanese troops entrenched at Daqiao, originally numbering over 200, were reinforced by over 100 more from Yangzhou on the night of the 20th. On the morning of the 21st, after a brave counter-attack by a unit of the Northern Jiangsu Chinese Army, the Japanese troops, unable to withstand the assault, retreated towards Yangzhou. A portion of the retreating troops passing through Sima were also ambushed by Chinese guerilla forces, suffering significant casualties. By approximately 1:00 PM, the Japanese troops had retreated in disarray back to their warships and forcibly extorted seven or eight thousand yuan in cash from the Daqiao area before departing. Currently, Daqiao has been recovered by the Northern Jiangsu Chinese Army and is garrisoned by units under First Route Staff Officer Yin and Fang Jun. Additionally, the First Battalion of the Chinese Army Special Operations Regiment attacked Xiannu Temple on the morning of the 21st, engaging the Japanese troops for approximately two hours before ceasing hostilities. The Japanese troops expended a great deal of ammunition, while the Chinese Army sustained no losses and safely returned to their positions.

### Alleged Assassination of the Puppet Hangzhou County Magistrate Wang Lian

Bomb Thrown at Hangzhou Great World

Hangzhou Correspondence: The Hangzhou Japanese Tamura Unit, amidst the tense situation in Jiaxing and the suburbs of Shanghai, abruptly dispatched 4,000 troops to Jiaxing a week ago, allocating over 1,000 to Shanghai, leaving the Japanese stronghold in Hangzhou exceptionally vulnerable. In recent days, plainclothes guerilla units known as the "Barehanded Traitor Extermination Corps" have infiltrated Hangzhou City. The other day, at the Great World entertainment venue in the New Market, while a play was being enthusiastically performed and Japanese troops were also in attendance, suddenly at 3:00 PM, someone threw multiple hand grenades, causing an explosion on the spot, severely injuring several Japanese soldiers and causing widespread chaos. Simultaneously, over 100 members of a Women's Special Operations Team have already crossed the river and secretly entered Hangzhou City, with traces of these individuals frequently being discovered in teahouses and hotels, where they are training in unconventional warfare tactics with the aim of disrupting the Japanese rear. Furthermore, Wang Lian, the puppet Hangzhou County Magistrate, was reportedly fatally shot by a youth from the aforementioned corps in Guanxiang Kou. Since then, terrorist incidents have occurred continuously, prompting a full-scale mobilization of the Hangzhou Military Police, conducting house-to-house searches and issuing a decree prohibiting all merchants and residents of the city from relocating or moving, effective from February 25th.

### New Japanese Note Delivered to the Shanghai Municipal Council Yesterday; Reportedly More Moderate in Tone; Rumors of a Compromise Plan

Regarding the terrorist incidents in the International Settlement, the Shanghai Municipal Council's reply to the Japanese protest was sent out on Saturday afternoon last week. However, due to its resolute wording, the Japanese side deemed it unsatisfactory and convened a meeting on the Izumo flagship to discuss their response and telegraphed Tokyo for instructions, hoping to escalate the situation. Subsequently, the Japanese Consul-General Miura received instructions from Tokyo and decided to present a new note to the Shanghai Municipal Council. Initially scheduled for a personal visit to Council Chairman Fessenden on the afternoon before yesterday, it was postponed due to the need for revisions to the wording and content. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the Modern News Agency to relevant parties yesterday, the so-called new Japanese note was personally presented by Japanese Consul-General Miura to Council Chairman Fessenden at the Shanghai Municipal Council at 5:00 PM yesterday. Its wording and content are reported to be more moderate, not as severe as reported in the newspapers, and generally contain three key points: (1) The Japanese side is willing to cooperate sincerely with the Shanghai Municipal Council; (2) To continue search operations to prevent the recurrence of terrorist incidents; (3) To expand the number of Japanese police officers, filling existing vacancies first. At the same time, they expressed satisfaction with the point in the Shanghai Municipal Council's reply stating, "The Shanghai Municipal Council is willing to cooperate with the Japanese side to effectively maintain law and order." It is reported that after presenting the new note and briefly discussing the matter, the Japanese Consul-General departed. It is further understood that the Shanghai Municipal Council will submit the new note to the Consular Body for consideration.

Compromise Plan Possible

The Continental Daily News reports that, regarding the recent activities of terrorists, since the initial suggestions were made to the Shanghai Municipal Council by the Japanese military, naval, and diplomatic authorities, there have been no fewer than four exchanges of notes containing demands and countermeasures in the past two weeks. Yesterday, it was generally anticipated that the Japanese authorities would present a compromise plan to the Council. Both the Japanese and the Council authorities refused to disclose the nature of the four exchanges of notes. Yesterday, it was learned that the Council, at the request of the Japanese side, is maintaining secrecy regarding the negotiations. A Japanese spokesperson told reporters last night that negotiations are underway and that no official statement will be issued.

Sir Robert Clive's Visit to the Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs

Reuters, Tokyo, February 28th: Sir Robert Clive, the British Ambassador to Japan, visited Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Sawada today, expressing hope for a peaceful resolution of the Shanghai situation. Sawada informed him that negotiations with the Shanghai Municipal Council are currently proceeding smoothly. According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, the new Japanese note submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council is based on instructions from the Japanese government and contains three key points: (1) Acknowledgment of the Shanghai Municipal Council's expression of readiness to cooperate with the Japanese authorities to protect Japanese residents and prevent terrorist acts in the International Settlement; (2) Japan recognizes this preparation as the Shanghai Municipal Council's agreement to cooperate with Japan in the future; (3) Based on this understanding, Japanese police agencies may exercise their cooperation with the Shanghai Municipal Council.

London Watches Shanghai Situation

Reuters, London, February 27th: During the House of Commons session today, Conservative MP Graham raised a question asking the Prime Minister whether he would make strong representations to the Japanese government regarding the unlawful situation in the areas occupied by Japanese troops around the Shanghai International Settlement, and the danger posed to British residents due to the presence of certain undesirable elements. Conservative MP Haslam also raised a similar question regarding the increase in gambling dens in certain Japanese-occupied areas. Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax was aware of the unsatisfactory situation in the western district of Shanghai and had urged the local Japanese authorities and the Japanese government to address the matter.

Havas Agency, London, February 27th: Regarding the various demands made by the Japanese authorities to the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council, Sir Milner, a Conservative MP, recently asked Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons whether the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary were aware that some sections of roads in the Shanghai International Settlement's extraterritorial road area, although purchased and built by the Shanghai Municipal Council, were patrolled by police from the "Chinese Administrative Authority" established by the Japanese authorities, and that the areas where recent incidents occurred were completely controlled by this "Chinese Administrative Authority" and were not under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council; and whether the Prime Minister had received information that various incidents referred to by the Japanese authorities had also occurred within the areas directly administered by the Shanghai Municipal Council; and whether the government supported the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council in resisting the various demands of the Japanese side and preventing changes to the existing organization of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied immediately, "Yes, the Japanese authorities have made certain suggestions to the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council under the pretext of maintaining law and order, which Foreign Secretary Halifax is aware of. These suggestions are being considered by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the British government is closely monitoring the situation and is prepared to provide advice and support to the Shanghai Municipal Council within possible limits. As for extraterritorial roads, the police authority over those within the defense zones of various countries' troops is still exercised by the Shanghai Municipal Council, but certain roads are within the jurisdiction of the Chinese Municipality surrounding Shanghai, where Chen Lu, the Foreign Minister of the Nanjing 'Reformed Government,' was assassinated. Another assassination (referring to the Li Guojie case) occurred within the Shanghai International Settlement."

Puppet Troops' Garrison Not Worth a Laugh

The Continental Daily News reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council and naval authorities yesterday mocked the Japanese message from Tokyo that there was a "silent declaration of war on the International Settlement and British and French ships." They received information that the "Reformed Government" would send puppet troops to the borders of the two settlements and secretly laughed. It is generally believed that this message is absurd and not worth a laugh. Some pointed out that after the Japanese dispatched armed puppet troops to any area where Chinese guerrillas were active, they remained silent, as countless puppet troops defected after being sent out. Apart from a small number of puppet police allowed to be armed, there are currently no armed Chinese hired by the Japanese here, nor has it been heard that any puppet troops have been deployed for combat in any area of Jiangsu Province. Others believe it is doubtful whether the spokesperson of the Nanjing puppet government ever made such a statement, or whether it was the imagination of an overly enthusiastic reporter.

Japanese Newspaper Criticizes the French Concession Again

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports:

There have been continuous developments in the western district in recent days. For example, British military patrols are conducting more thorough patrols in their defense zone with French Town and other extraterritorial locations. Outside the defense lines, Japanese marines are seen marching along Hongqiao Road in groups, possibly engaged in anti-guerrilla work. It is heard that the Japanese sentries at the bridges in Hongkou have been removed today, perhaps indicating a shortage of Japanese troops. A Japanese-language newspaper yesterday criticized the French Concession police, claiming that the French Concession had captured 80 guerrillas attempting to infiltrate the settlement and then released them, returning their weapons to their leader. The Japanese authorities are paying close attention to this matter and are currently investigating it. According to personnel of the French Concession police this morning (February 28th), the rumor is completely unfounded.

Increase in Troops in Japanese Defense Zone

After terrorist incidents were continuously discovered in the Japanese defense zone in the Shanghai western road district, the Japanese and puppet authorities were greatly alarmed and fearful. After several attacks by Chinese guerrilla forces, their predicament became even more apparent, and they felt it was difficult to justify their position. Therefore, in recent days, they have greatly increased the deployment of troops to garrison in the Shanghai western district. As of yesterday, it is reported that in the area west of Great Western Road and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, such as Avenue du President Doumer, Jessfield Park, Yu Yuen Road, etc., Japanese army troops are now stationed. The Caojiadu area, as well as Singapore Road, Yichang Road, Gordon Road, Macau Road, and other locations where Japanese-owned yarn factories are located, are generally garrisoned by Japanese naval marines. All major intersections are guarded by four or five sentries. Therefore, the number of Japanese troops stationed in the Shanghai western district has greatly increased. In addition, the Japanese elementary school at the intersection of Pinlang Road and Rue Robert is now being used by the Japanese army as a garrison command headquarters in the area. A watchtower has been built at the entrance, and troops are stationed there day and night. However, these actions are purely within the Japanese defense zone and are not related to the border areas of the settlement at all.

### Japanese Warships Bomb Zhenhai; No Losses on Our Side; Ningbo Situation Peaceful; Foreign Ships Sail as Usual; German Ship Hanna Repairs Completed, Joins Service to Ningbo Tomorrow

Outside Zhenhai port in Ningbo, a Japanese warship suddenly appeared the morning before yesterday and fired over 30 rounds towards the shore. According to shipping industry sources yesterday, the Japanese warship left after firing, and there were no losses on our side. The situation in Ningbo remains peaceful, and shipping is still smooth. Details of each situation are recorded below:

Japanese Warships Bomb, We Suffer No Losses

Recently, the Japanese military has been unable to make progress in its invasion of China on various fronts, and the Chinese army in western Zhejiang's Qiantang River area has a strong momentum and the potential to directly attack Hangzhou. Therefore, in order to contain the Chinese army's forces, it has been conducting harassment in the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang. However, because our side is heavily guarded, it has ultimately not succeeded. Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 AM the morning before yesterday, a Japanese warship suddenly sailed to the outside of Zhenhai port in Ningbo and immediately began shelling the fortress, firing as many as 38 rounds in succession. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the Modern News Agency to the shipping industry yesterday, the Japanese warship fired from a relatively long distance, and many shells landed along the riverbank. The Chinese defenders suffered no damage, so they ignored the shelling. The Japanese warship also did not dare to go deeper and immediately turned around and sailed away.

Ningbo Peaceful, Shipping Unobstructed

According to a foreign shipping company, a telegram was received from Ningbo yesterday reporting that although Zhenhai was harassed by Japanese warships shelling the area the morning before yesterday, Ningbo's people are very stable because the fortress's defenses are solid. They are calmly dealing with this action by the Japanese side. The local situation is as peaceful as ever. Foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, such as the Moufu, Deping, Tangsai, Xin Anna, Xin Beijing, etc., are all sailing as usual without any obstruction. In addition, after the Japanese side implemented harassment and prevented foreign ships from sailing to Haimen, foreign companies believe that the situation there is now stable. Therefore, in order to safeguard navigation rights and maintain business, they are planning to resume shipping on that route.

Hanna Repairs Completed, Joins Service to Ningbo

The German Far East Shipping Company's Hanna, which entered the Shanghai dock for annual repairs last month, has been under repair for nearly a month. The work has now been completed, and it is scheduled to leave the dock today. The ship originally sailed the Shanghai-Taizhou route, but as transportation to Taizhou has not yet resumed, it has been temporarily decided to sail to Ningbo first. It is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai at 4:00 PM on February 2nd. In the future, the ship may sail to a fixed location and load fish.

### Tight Security in the Concession

The North-China Daily News reports that, in order to prevent terrorists from continuing to enter the concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council Works Department began a procedure on Saturday and Sunday to erect barbed wire fences to seal off all alleys and roads that connect the concession to areas outside its borders. Laborers from the Works Department followed this procedure and spent the entire day yesterday (February 27th) working diligently in the Jing'an Temple district and on roads outside the borders. It is reported that the barbed wire fences on Columbia Road and Dunsint Road have been completed, and all alleys in the Jing'an Temple and Chengdu Road districts have indeed been sealed off. It is expected that the work of erecting fences will begin today (February 28th) in the Gordon Road and Bubbling Well Road districts. However, it is estimated that this

Security Procedure

will take some time to complete. At the same time, police search teams are also active throughout the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession, paying particular attention to the Western District, Yu Yuen Road, Great Western Road, and Edinburgh Road. However, there were no large-scale searches yesterday. Police activity regarding searches was almost exclusively limited to

Stopping Cars

and pedestrians in the Western District for searches by the search teams. Uniformed patrols boarded buses at various stops and checked passengers while the buses were in transit in order to avoid traffic congestion and delays and to prevent unnecessary inconvenience to the public. A reserve patrol team, including several officers armed with handguns and machine guns, conducted frequent searches yesterday morning at the corner of Great Western Road and Edinburgh Road. As far as can be ascertained, no one was arrested yesterday,

Nor Were Weapons

confiscated. However, the strict security measures currently in place seem to have slightly deterred criminals and terrorists, as there have been no major crimes in recent days. Since the police have tightened security, there has been no assassination case for a week as of today, and armed robberies in the Shanghai International Settlement have also greatly decreased. The decrease in armed robberies may be due to the fact that most armed bandits are hiding in areas outside the settlement. Only the most daring bandits attempt to ply their "trade" these days, as bandits are

Easily Arrested

in the Shanghai International Settlement. White Russian merchant groups continue to patrol outside the settlement and assist police search teams at various wharves, conducting thorough searches of those coming from Pudong. From morning to night, the British West Kent Regiment continues to patrol Nanjing Road, spending the night in the Racecourse Barracks, so that they can be dispatched in case of unexpected events. They wore steel helmets

on Their Bodies

yesterday, which is the first time they have done so since they began patrolling Nanjing Road following security procedures. Trucks carrying US Marine Corps soldiers continue to patrol the main thoroughfares in their defense zone. Two Marine Corps soldiers are stationed at the corner of Yu Qiaqing Road and Jing'an Temple Road, equipped with a military telephone to report any possible disturbances, whatever their nature, to headquarters. Italian troops are also patrolling their defense zone day and night. The current security measures show no signs of being relaxed.

### Japanese and Puppet Authorities Purchase 1.5 Million Piculs of Rice; Difficulty in Re-exporting Rice; Ministry of Finance Approves Duty-Free Import of Foreign Rice to Guangdong

After the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association made every effort to regulate the food supply, the rice supply in Shanghai is sufficient and the price is stable, strictly enforcing the limit of 14 yuan per picul. Affected by the Japanese and puppet authorities' purchases, the stockpiles in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui production areas have gradually decreased, and prices have risen. The total amount of exports has exceeded 1.5 million piculs. The Japanese side does not allow rice to be transported south. Details are as follows:

Japanese and Puppet Authorities Purchase Chinese Rice

The amount of rice purchased by the Japanese and puppet authorities from the production areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, up to the end of the overall accounting, has exceeded 1.5 million piculs. All of it is loaded onto Japanese ships from ports such as Zhapu in Zhejiang, Hupu in Jiangsu, and Wuhu in Anhui for export to Tianjin and Qingdao in North China, as well as to Japan. Moreover, the military food needed by the Japanese army in its war of aggression against China is also supplied with Chinese rice. The export of this rice does not go through customs procedures and conflicts with the Chinese government's order prohibiting the export of rice.

Prohibition of Rice Transport to the South, Rice Merchants Stop Procurement

Since the Japanese side announced that third-country ships are not allowed to transport rice to the south, the Jianghai Customs has also been forced by circumstances to prohibit the re-export of rice to eastern Zhejiang and Fujian and Guangdong. Various Shanghai-based merchant guilds from Shantou, Quanzhou, Ningbo, and other places have stopped procuring rice for transport to the south. It is reported that the chambers of commerce in Shantou, Chaozhou, and other places sent telegrams to the government, requesting permission for the duty-free import of foreign rice in order to maintain the food supply, as the rice shortage in those areas is becoming increasingly serious and rice prices are soaring. The Ministry of Finance has now approved the duty-free transport of foreign rice to Guangdong.

Shanghai Makes Every Effort to Stabilize Rice Prices

Fortunately, after the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association and others dredged the source of supply, the rice supply in the concessions is about 700,000 bags, enough to sustain for several months. However, affected by the Japanese and puppet authorities' purchases from the production areas, prices in the production areas have risen. Due to cost limitations, rice merchants in Shanghai are unable to lower rice prices after the market opens. The current price of number one white rice has reached 13.5 yuan, only 5 jiao (0.5 yuan) below the association's price limit of 14 yuan. Therefore, the Rice Industry Association has ordered the Market Management Committee to strictly enforce the price limit and not to exceed 14 yuan.

### Post Office Resumes Small Package Mail to Kunming Today

Limited to One Kilogram, Postage Fee Three Yuan

The Small Package Mail Joint Dispatch Group of the Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice yesterday stating, "From March 1st, all large small packages of mail sent to Kunming and various places along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway in Yunnan Province can be resumed for collection and delivery. This is hereby announced. The weight is limited to one kilogram, and the fee is three yuan per kilogram.

### Increasing Circulation of Japanese Banknotes; Japanese Newspaper Expresses Distress; This Month's Lowest Circulation Quantity Far Exceeds Last Month's Minimum Circulation Amount

The Daguobao reports that an editorial in the financial section of the Yomiuri Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper in Tokyo, lamented that the progress in reducing the circulation of Japanese banknotes this month is not as smooth as in previous years at this time. This month's lowest quantity of Japanese banknotes in circulation far exceeds last month's minimum circulation amount. In February of last year, the lowest circulation amount was 1,670,000,000 yen, but this February's lowest circulation amount is about 500,000,000 yen higher than the previous figure. Since February 10th, the circulation of Japanese banknotes has shown a renewed upward trend, and it is expected to continue to increase. The low circulation amount in January will be the lowest record for banknote issuance this year.

### Former "Huangdao Hui" Leader Chang Yuqing Secretly Returns to Shanghai to Make Trouble; Reportedly to Engage in Eliminating "Terrorists"; Initial Plan to Manipulate Leadership of Shanghai Western Gambling Dens

(Exclusive Report from Our Newspaper) Our reporter recently learned from extremely reliable sources that the continuous occurrence of traitor-elimination incidents in this city has caused extreme anxiety among the Japanese and puppet personnel. It is learned that in addition to wantonly threatening and unreasonably blaming the Shanghai Municipal Council in order to achieve its exorbitant demands, the Japanese and puppet authorities have also taken

Retaliatory Measures

by secretly ordering Chang Yuqing, the former leader of the "Huangdao Hui," to come to Shanghai to lead the puppet Shanghai Special Service Team and actively carry out the specialized task of investigating so-called "anti-Japanese" "terrorists." It is now heard that after receiving the above-mentioned puppet order, Chang secretly came to Shanghai from Beijing on February 27th and is hiding on Old Baziz Road in Hongkou. According to Chang's boast

to a Certain Party

he will use the recently established "China Anqing League" and the old members of the former "Huangdao Hui" as the foundation to engage in the task of eliminating "terrorists," claiming that he will be able to demonstrate his authority within a week. It is vaguely heard that Chang's initial investigation work will be to rectify the gambling dens in the Shanghai Western area,

in order to prevent

the infiltration of "terrorists." According to his opinion, he plans to request the Japanese military authorities to move all the gambling dens in the Shanghai Western area to Nanshi for business. However, according to those familiar with the situation, Chang has long coveted the leadership of the gambling dens in the Shanghai Western area, but has never succeeded. Now that the Japanese side has given him the above-mentioned puppet order, Chang can

Take This Opportunity

to seize it under a false pretense. However, since most gambling den owners have invested heavily in the Shanghai Western area, it may not be easy to move all the gambling dens to Nanshi based on Chang's personal opinion. (Note: Chang Yuqing led his gang to create many pro-Japanese terrorist incidents in the Shanghai International Settlement in July and August of last year. The First Special District Court has long issued an arrest warrant for this 315-pound bathhouse owner.)

### City Party Headquarters Sends Telegram of Congratulations to Vice Minister Pan

The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters and its affiliated district party headquarters sent a telegram of congratulations on this occasion of Mr. Pan Gongzhan's appointment as Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department. The original text is as follows:

(2) We are delighted to hear of your honorable appointment to the Ministry of Propaganda. Great plans await to be unfurled, the Party's righteousness is proclaimed, and morale is boosted. Achieving victory over the enemy is within reach. We send this telegram of congratulations and hope for your kind consideration. Respectfully, All District Party Headquarters of Shanghai City.

### Lingnan Foreigners in Shanghai Praise Chinese Soldiers' Bravery, Strict Discipline, and Courtesy; Skilled at Laying False Trails, Losses Are Minimal

The Mainland Daily reports that thirty-four foreigners who evacuated from Kuling arrived at the Osaka Shosen Kaisha pier at around 11:00 AM yesterday (the 27th). Many friends and relatives were waiting at the pier. However, they were not aboard a Japanese military transport ship as previously reported, but rather a cargo ship belonging to the Osaka Shosen Kaisha. They all stated that they were able to descend the mountain and come to Shanghai thanks to the

full assistance of the Chinese army

and the Japanese authorities. According to one of the foreigners, the Japanese army had shelled the vicinity of Kuling, and the houses where the foreigners resided were hit by three shells, fortunately without causing any injuries. The foreigners first experienced the terror of an air raid on February 16. That morning, they heard the drone of airplanes, initially thinking it was just the usual reconnaissance by Japanese planes. However, they then saw nine Japanese planes circling the mountain, dropping at least forty bombs. They were certain that on that day, no Chinese or foreigners in Kuling

were injured or killed,

but three empty houses belonging to foreigners were destroyed and could not be repaired. The Yangtze River from Jiujiang downwards is as safe as before. The ship they were on was not escorted along the way, and it was only when approaching Songhu that a Japanese warship guided the ship into port. Another British resident said that if the Japanese army launches a large-scale offensive, the Chinese army will not defend Mount Lu to the death. The

Chinese military officer

in charge of the area told me that the mountain was completely surrounded, and that any resistance would result in the meaningless sacrifice of soldiers who had fought bravely. It is estimated that there are about four to five thousand Chinese soldiers in the Mount Lu area, with excellent weapons and ample supplies of ammunition, but a shortage of food. They are still wearing summer uniforms. Their bravery and skill in battle under such circumstances is truly admirable. Moreover, they are

courteous

and strictly disciplined, whether as individuals or in groups. They all seemed to be well aware of their own position and the position of the foreigners in Kuling. As far as I know, they may attempt a breakout in foggy or dark conditions. The British resident firmly denied the claim that the Chinese army was using foreign-owned properties as barracks, stating that he inspected several houses vacated by foreigners almost every day until he left the mountain and never saw any signs of the Chinese army occupying them. When asked what kind of resistance the Chinese army was putting up, the British resident replied,

"What kind of resistance

can those with rifles offer against long-range cannons and powerful bombs? They can only make the most of the terrain to avoid shells and bombs. As far as I know, the Chinese army is skilled at laying false trails, so losses during battle are minimal, and they have been able to contain the Japanese army for quite some time." A Japanese spokesman confirmed last night that they had shelled the outskirts of Kuling on Saturday and Sunday, but he had no

definite information

as to whether the outskirts of Kuling had been shelled. Another foreigner who evacuated to Shanghai said that when they left Kuling, about fifty foreigners remained on the mountain, some of whom were disabled and had difficulty moving around, but most of them were unwilling to leave because they owned properties and other things in Kuling. They had enough food to last for two to three months. There was a battery-powered radio on the mountain that received news from the outside world. They had previously been able to receive broadcasts from Shanghai.

Sending telegrams

from Kuling was done by the Chinese military authorities. Letters were also occasionally delivered by the Chinese army, but it is not known by what route. Major Jeff of the American warship "Wake" and Major Stanford of the British warship "Petrel" had visited Kuling three times to discuss evacuation matters. It was also learned that although the Japanese side did not restrict the amount of luggage carried by the evacuated foreigners, the circumstances did not allow them to carry many items. After boarding the Japanese ship, they all signed a document issued by the Japanese side,

which stipulated that

evacuated foreigners must: (1) strictly obey the orders of the captain and officers; (2) not leave the ship mid-voyage; (3) endure all difficulties on board without complaint; (4) not depict scenery or take photographs or films while sailing down the Yangtze River; (5) voluntarily take risks on this trip, and not seek compensation for any losses incurred under any circumstances; (6) never verbally or in writing disclose to others what they have seen and heard about the Japanese army and navy in China, otherwise they will not be allowed to return to Kuling.

### The Ministry of Finance Allocates Huge Sums to Repay the Principal and Interest on the Reconstruction Public Bonds, totaling 11,645,000 Yuan; Allocates 4,800,000 Yuan to the Railway Construction Fund

In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has decided to advance funds to pay the principal and interest on the Reconstruction Public Bonds, even though funds are scarce. It will also allocate 4.8 million yuan for the redemption and interest payments on the Railway Construction Bonds. Bondholders are reassured by the government's determination to maintain creditworthiness, and the Shanghai bond market is stable with steady prices. Details are as follows:

Advance Payment of Principal and Interest on Reconstruction Public Bonds

The National Debt Fund Management Committee issued a notice stating: "The sixth installment of principal and interest payment on the Reconstruction Public Bonds of the 25th year of the Republic of China will be made from February 28th of this year by the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance. This is hereby announced." The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has received a telegram from the head office stating that the method of principal and interest payment for the Reconstruction Public Bonds is exactly the same as that for the Unified Public Bonds. Full payment will be made in Chongqing, and "exchange permits" will be issued in Shanghai, to be paid in six installments over six months.

Allocating Funds to the Railway Construction Bond Fund

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Ministry of Finance has allocated a subsidy of 4.8 million yuan from the national treasury to the account of the National Debt Fund Management Committee at the Central Bank for the third redemption and interest payment of the first series of Railway Construction Bonds and the second redemption and interest payment of the second series. This fund is to be used for the redemption and interest payment of the said bonds, which have not entered the market. A total of 80 million yuan for the first and second series of bonds were mortgaged by the former Ministry of Railways to various banks.

Periodic Draws for Three Types of Public Bonds

The seventh redemption of the Category B Bonds of the Unified Public Bonds of the 25th year of the Republic of China, the eleventh redemption of the Long-Term Financial Public Bonds of the 17th year of the Republic of China, and the fourth redemption of the Telecommunications Public Bonds of the 24th year of the Republic of China will be drawn at 10:00 AM on March 10th, according to the National Debt Fund Management Committee. Relevant agencies have been requested to send personnel to supervise. The redemption dates are July 31st for the Unified Bonds and March 31st for the Long-Term Financial Bonds and the Telecommunications Bonds. The paying banks are the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications.

No Orders Received for Discounting Public Bonds

Regarding the various bonds of the Unified Public Bonds, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank had agreed with the three banks before the war that bondholders could apply to the three banks for discounting of drawn bonds and upcoming interest coupons. After the war, this discounting was suspended. It was rumored that the Ministry of Finance had ordered the three banks to resume it, but according to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank yesterday, the bank had not received any orders from the Ministry of Finance, nor had it convened a meeting to discuss this issue. The rumor of resumption is clearly untrue.

The Securities Market Has Stabilized

Since the Ministry of Finance announced that the Central Bank would no longer advance funds for the customs-guaranteed bonds, there had been a period of intense volatility in the unofficial securities trading market in Shanghai regarding the various bonds of the Unified Public Bonds. However, because the Ministry of Finance continued to advance funds for the principal and interest payments of the Unified Public Bonds due on January 31st, the bond market gradually stabilized. Now, because the Reconstruction Public Bonds due on February 28th will also be redeemed and have their interest paid as usual, the market situation for the Unified Bonds has risen sharply, and people's minds are at ease.

### Jianghai Customs Resumes Branch Offices

Local Goods Loaded, Unloaded, or Passing Through Must Be Subject to Transit Duty

The temporary transit duty collection points under the jurisdiction of the Jianghai Customs at the North Railway Station, Avenue de Billy, Hongqiao Road, Daxilu, and Suzhou Creek Road had previously suspended operations due to being located in war zones. Now that the situation in these areas has stabilized somewhat, operations have resumed starting today. The offices and personnel of the various departments have been arranged and a notice was issued yesterday stating, "The temporary transit duty collection points under this Customs at the North Railway Station, Avenue de Billy, Hongqiao Road, Daxilu, and Suzhou Creek Road were temporarily suspended due to the unrest of the times. It is now decided that all operations will resume as usual from today (March 1st). All local goods transported by ships, junks, railways, highways, or air, regardless of where they originate or where they are destined, must be subject to transit duty according to regulations when loaded, unloaded, or passing through the above-mentioned collection points. All merchants are hereby informed."

### Collapse Vehicle Association Prepares to Modify Wheels

Organizes Registration of All Members of the Trade - Cooperative Operation to Lighten the Burden

The Shanghai Market Collapse Vehicle Industry Mutual Aid Association and the tiger car operators' plan to convert to two-inch wide iron wheels was originally scheduled to be implemented by the Public Works Department this spring. However, because many tiger car operators are struggling to make a living, and business has declined sharply after the war, they are unable to complete the conversion according to the regulations of the Public Works Department. After repeated negotiations with the Mutual Aid Association and with the sympathy of Chinese directors such as Xi Yushu for the hardships of the workers, the Public Works Department agreed to allow the conversion to be completed according to the regulations of the Public Works Department by July 1st of this year. It is now learned that the Mutual Aid Association, in order to fulfill its promise and reduce the burden on the trade, has decided to plan and operate cooperatively on the conversion of military wheels. The association has scheduled to begin registering all members of the trade today to prepare everything in order to complete the conversion by July of this year under economic principles.

### Japanese and Puppet Control of the Silk Industry; Factories in the Concessions Reduce Work and Shut Down; Cocoon Raw Materials Are Banned from Being Transported to Shanghai, Resulting in Exhaustion; Mitsui & Co. Forcibly Purchases and Monopolizes the Rong Industry

Since the Japanese and puppets took control of the silk industry in the occupied areas, they have taken over the operation of various factories for silk reeling, issued silkworm eggs, handled cocoon collection, and monopolized the overseas raw silk market, resulting in extreme lack of raw materials and panic in the silk factories in the Shanghai concession area. Large quantities of high-quality dry cocoons are being shipped overseas. Details are as follows:

Forcible Purchase and Monopoly Operation

The Japanese are extremely jealous of the silk yarn industry in China. Since occupying the silk-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, they have tried their best to suppress it and have organized the so-called "Central China Silk Company" to implement control. Any factory in the occupied area that wants to start operations must cooperate with the company. In addition to the factories in Wuxi that have been taken over and are operating silk reeling without permission, silk factories in Tangxi, Xinshi, Jiaxing, and other places in Zhejiang are also under the management of the company. The quantity of output and the raw materials taken in must be reported to it, and a certain amount of management fee is collected. The silk reeled is all controlled by the Japanese firm Mitsui & Co., which forcibly purchases and monopolizes the operation.

Unauthorized Issuance of Silkworm Eggs and Ban on Cocoon Transport to Shanghai

The improved silkworm eggs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were issued by the management agencies of the two provinces before the war, but after the war, they are issued by the Japanese-controlled agencies. A certain fee is charged for each sheet, and farmers are forced to buy them. The cocoons produced are purchased by Japanese merchants, and the transport of dry cocoons to the Shanghai concession area is prohibited. The puppet organization has stipulated a method for establishing cocoon shops in the silk-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang when cocoons are on the market. Any merchant who wants to set up a shop in the silk-producing area to collect cocoons must obtain approval from the Japanese and puppets and pay a donation. All cocoons in the factories and bank warehouses in the occupied area have been seized by the Japanese and puppets, and the losses of the manufacturers are immeasurable.

Silk Factories in the Concessions Run Out of Raw Materials

After the factories in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang refused to cooperate with the Japanese and built new silk factories in Shanghai, there were a total of 45 factories with about 6,500 machines by the time the accounts were closed, including those of Lian Wu, Fu Long, Lian Cheng, Jian Ye, Yue Xing, Hua Lun, Fu Lun, Hong Feng, Yu Feng, Heng Shen, Le Chang, etc. These newly established silk factories made huge profits last year, but since this year, due to the Japanese ban on the transport of dry cocoons to Shanghai, there has been an extreme panic over raw materials. The 10,000 piculs of dry cocoons that used to be shipped from eastern Zhejiang to Shanghai have been exhausted, resulting in a small number of silk factories being forced to reduce machines or shut down.

Reducing Machines, Shutting Down, and Exporting Dry Cocoons

The cocoons in the Shanghai concessions have been exhausted, and factories are reducing machines and shutting down one after another. Whether they can resume operations after the spring cocoons come on the market depends on whether the cocoons can be transported to Shanghai at that time. Currently, the price of cocoons in Shanghai has risen to 400 yuan per picul, which is more than two-thirds higher than at the beginning of the war. However, there are still some merchants who are only interested in profit and are still shipping dry cocoons overseas. According to customs reports, the export of mulberry silkworm cocoons in the 27th year was 710,617 kilograms, valued at 1,894,315 yuan, all exported by Jianghai Customs.

Japanese Silk Dumped in Overseas Markets

After Japanese silk was dumped in overseas silk markets in New York and London, the quantity of Chinese silk exported sharply decreased. At the end of the 27th year, the stock of Japanese silk in New York warehouses was 47,844 bales, and the stock in London warehouses was 3,886 bales. The consumption of Chinese silk in December was 1,534 bales in New York, while the consumption of Japanese silk was 32,776 bales. In London, it was 98 bales for Chinese silk and 1,155 bales for Japanese silk, which is sufficient evidence that the overseas sales of Chinese silk have been seized by Japanese silk. The purpose of Japanese silk is to dump and monopolize everything, so it arbitrarily reduces prices. Moreover, the quantity of Chinese silk shipped to European and American markets by Mitsui & Co. is increasing daily.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Haiyan

And Threaten to Attack the County Seat - Chinese Army on High Alert

According to people from Haiyan, since the Chinese army recovered Haiyan in July of last year, local order has long been restored. The county government first moved back to the county seat, and the various agencies have been reorganized. The party headquarters has also recently begun work, so the people who were scattered in the countryside in the past have moved back one after another, and the market is quite lively. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the Lunar New Year's Eve, several Japanese planes suddenly flew over the county seat, dropping bombs and strafing with machine guns for a quarter of an hour, killing and wounding dozens of civilians and destroying more than ten houses. Fortunately, the local police and various legal groups maintained calmness and handled the aftermath, and order was quickly restored. However, it is learned that the Japanese army is still not satisfied and has threatened to attack the county seat from eight directions in the near future. It is heard that the Chinese army is on high alert and will put up a strong resistance if the enemy attacks.

### Robbed Chinese Police Pistol, Attacked Police Car - Gangster Recovered from Injuries and Interrogated - Two Gang Repeat Offenders' Major Cases Concluded and Awaiting Judgment - Remaining Offenders Handed Over to the Japanese Side, Two Escaped

The Public Concession Police Department, because of the tight defenses in the Hongqiao area of ​​Shanghai, murder and robbery were often heard, and weapons worn by public officials were even dared to be robbed. Patrol teams were organized, with four people as a group, fully armed, patrolling day and night, and police cars also dispatched at any time. On the 4th of last month, West Patrolman Soprat of the Public Concession Police Department, Chinese Patrolman Zhu Shouling, Wang Runhe, Detective Pang Ruiqing, Wang Jiachu and others learned that someone at a certain hospital on MacNaughten Road had requested a doctor to

treat gunshot wounds

They immediately went to the hospital and arrested the criminal Shao Yuren Chen Maotang (28 years old) and a person surnamed Xie on the spot and brought them to the police station. It was found that Xie was not involved and released, while Chen had an important relationship. According to Chen, he had an accomplice, Xu Xiaosizi (aka Zhang Xiaosanzi, 26 years old) from Jiangbei, who was shot and injured on Dunxin Road on the night of January 2nd and was now recuperating in a bungalow at 420 Fa Hua Zhen, and so on. Chinese and Western detectives, together with personnel from the Japanese Command, went to the address and

arrested seven men and three women

including Xu Xiaosizi, Shen Yuanfang and Ge Asan. At that time, someone threw a pistol with the number "1239" outside the door into a small river, but it was still recovered, taken to the Japanese Command, and transferred to the police station. However, the police station agreed to the request of the Japanese Command and, after the investigation was completed, allowed the return of all the arrested persons, and then began a careful investigation. Because Xu Xiaosizi had four bullets in his head and his injuries were serious, he was sent to the Public Works Bureau Hospital. It was also found that Chen Maotang, Xu Xiaosizi, Shen Yuanfang, Ge Asan, and Xiao Kai, who was at large, had committed the following crimes in the Concession:

Firing and Attacking

Police patrol cars, robbing Chinese police of their pistols, and theft, including (1) at 8:30 pm on December 2nd of last year, armed invasion of Ni Gengsheng's clothing store at 1211 Rue Cardinal Mercier, robbing 300 yuan of property, (2) at 12:10 pm on December 17th of last year, gathering people at the entrance of Lane 174, Route Gustare, to rob Chinese Police No. 2725 of his "916" pistol and Chinese Police No. 2743 of his "1239" pistol

One pistol each

(3) at 7:10 pm on January 1st of this year, breaking into the Minsheng and Guan Village candy stores at 1034 and 1036 Yu Yuan Road and robbing 160 yuan of property, (4) at 10:10 pm on January 2nd of this year, when a Public Works Bureau police car was passing through Dunxin Road, Xu Xiaosizi used his robbed "916" pistol to shoot at the police car. The patrolman returned fire, hitting Xu in the head four times, but Xu

escaped with injuries

All the "1239" pistols have been recovered in the river, and the other "916" pistol was found by Ge Asan in a straw shed on Route Gustare on January 5th. After the police station completed the investigation, Chen Maotang was detained, Xu Xiaosizi was injured in the hospital, and the remaining seven men and three women, including Ge Asan, were returned to the Japanese Command on January 13th. On January 25th, the police station suddenly received a notice from the Japanese side that Ge Asan and Shen Yuanfang had

escaped.

The police station had already recorded the confessions of the two men, and now Xu's injuries have healed. Yesterday morning, he was taken out of the hospital along with Chen Maotang and sent to the First Special Court. The police station lawyer Li Zhishan stated the above situation and prosecuted them for attempted murder and robbery under Articles 271 and 330 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, the two defendants admitted most of the charges. The presiding judge ordered the two defendants to be detained and the official verdict to be announced on February 7th.

### Detective Posing as a Dancer Secretly Discovers Dancer's Secrets - Dancer Unable to Bear the Burden, Commits Theft and Is Arrested - Admits to the Crime Under Interrogation, Sentenced to 20 Days of Detention

Zhang Qing, also known as Xue Mengna, a 22-year-old woman from Wuxi, came to Shanghai due to the impact of the war and became a dancer at the Xuan Gong Ballroom. She lived upstairs at No. 11, Lane 176, Chongqing Road, but her family of several people relied entirely on Zhang's income from embracing to make a living, so Zhang's burden was extremely heavy. Her monthly income was always insufficient to cover her expenses, and she was often in a state of financial distress. On the 24th of the month, Zhang was again forced by economic necessity to take advantage of her roommate Bao Zhenfa's carelessness at around 4:00 pm and stole Bao's fox-lined fur coat, pawning it at Yonglong Pawnshop on Avenue Foch for twelve yuan to meet her immediate needs. When Bao discovered this, he reported it to the Chengdu Road police station. After investigation by Chinese Detective No. 35, it was found that Zhang had committed the crime. However, Zhang firmly denied it. The detective ordered a colleague to pose as a dancer and inquire about Zhang's tone of voice, and finally learned all her secrets. Then, the detective arrested Zhang and recovered the stolen goods. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the 8th Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted her for theft. When questioned, Zhang confessed that she was forced by economic pressure to resort to this measure. After Judge Meng verified the confession, he sentenced Zhang Qing to 20 days of detention for theft as a warning.

### The Case of the Assassination of Hua Runquan - Heard Yesterday - Ordered to Reschedule and Verify Again

Hua Runquan, the manager of the Longhua Shanghai Cement Company, had an office at No. 518, Enterprise Bank Building, No. 33 Sichuan Road. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the cement company has been in the war zone and cannot work. After the national army withdrew from Shanghai, the company was unable to operate because it was in

### The "Unified Tax Bureau" Section Chief Tao Yuqi Nearly Assassinated by Strong Men: He Himself Alert, Immediately Shuts Off Main Light Switch; Strong Men Unable to Act, Tao Escapes

Tao Yuying, a Suzhou native residing at No. 17, Ruihua Fang, at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route Pellerin in the French Concession, previously held the position of private goods inspector in the Investigation Section of the Unified Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. Since the withdrawal of the National Revolutionary Army from Shanghai to the west during the winter before last, the Unified Tax Bureau also moved accordingly. The Shanghai office of the Unified Tax Bureau was forcibly occupied by the Japanese puppet army, and the traitor Shao Shijun organized a false Unified Tax Bureau. At that time, Tao also changed his allegiance and soared to become a

New Elite

Entering the puppet tax bureau as section chief, for a year he has been engaged in extortion, accumulating a considerable amount of ill-gotten wealth. Recently, he purchased a new-style automobile for transportation, going out every night with his wife to dance halls and gambling tables, squandering money like dirt. Neighbors residing in the same neighborhood all regard him as a traitor, even children living in the same alley can say it. At about six o'clock the night before last, Tao was at home when suddenly

Strong Men

Three men, each carrying a handgun, entered through the back door of Tao's house. Just as dinner was being prepared, Tao's servants were all crowded in the kitchen. The three strong men entered the room and immediately took out their guns, preventing the servants from making a sound, claiming that they were there to kill a traitor and that it was none of their business. One of the three strong men, holding a gun, entered the parlor, found the telephone, and immediately cut the telephone line with a knife to prevent communication with the

Outside

At this tense moment, Tao himself discovered it, and in a moment of alertness, immediately shut off the main light switch. In an instant, the house was plunged into darkness. The three strong men, realizing that the plan had failed, did not linger and left through the back door. Tao, taking advantage of the darkness when the lights went out, went out through the front door, hurried to the back door of the Zhu family at No. 24 across the street, using the excuse of borrowing a phone to

Temporarily Hide

However, the Zhu family initially refused, as they did not know him. After Tao mentioned someone who knew the Zhu family and asked for their help, they agreed to let him in to borrow the phone. Tao then entered the house and dialed the phone randomly for a while, then went out and headed south, exiting through the barber shop at the southern entrance of Ruihua Fang, and took Route du Père Huc to escape to a

Hotel

For lodging. Later, Tao's family reported to the Louza Police Station of the French Concession. After the chief detective sent officers to investigate, Tao's wife was summoned to the police station for questioning yesterday. It is said that Tao himself dares not return home and has sought a suitable safe residence elsewhere.

### Shanghai Cement Company's Alleged Sale to "Certain Parties" Clarified

Due to the war, the Shanghai Cement Company in Longhua was in a

Special Circumstance

Under which it was difficult to recover, so it had no choice but to transfer its operations to the German firm禪臣洋行 for management. However, after 禪臣洋行 took over, it was ultimately unable to resume operations due to control by certain parties, and the factory site was also seized by certain parties. Therefore, rumors spread that the Shanghai Cement Company had been sold to certain parties, causing misunderstandings among the general public. At 10:15 AM on December 24th last year, Hua, while taking the

Elevator Downstairs

Just stepped out of the elevator when several men lying in wait each took out a handgun and fired at Hua continuously. Five bullets hit Hua's robe, but none penetrated his skin, allowing him to escape unharmed. At that time, patrol officers No. 2236, No. 2792, and No. 3105 heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, surrounding and capturing one of the assassins, Tang Yuqing, a Shanghai native. A

Mauser Handgun

Containing three bullets was seized, and another abandoned handgun with nine bullets was found at the scene. He was taken back to the General Police Station for investigation. The investigation procedures have now been completed, and yesterday morning, Tang was escorted to the Special No. 1 Court. The agent of the Public Works Department Police, charged him with attempted murder under Article 271, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, briefly stating the facts and requesting an adjournment for further questioning. After a brief interrogation of the defendant by the court, the judge ordered him to be detained for further review at a later date.

### Nervous Breakdown or Possession by a Wronged Soul? Continued Trial of Adopted Daughter's Poisoning of Adoptive Mother: Niece Cries Out for a Wise Judge to Save Her

Zhuang, the wife of Qian Wenbiao, a Ningbo native residing at No. 146, Dexing Lane, Peng Road, coveted the wealth of Zhuang Xu, the mother of Qian Qimai, and secretly put ten "Adilin" pills into the pot of cough medicine being decocted by Zhuang Xu on the evening of January 16. This caused Zhuang Xu to die after taking the medicine. After someone reported the incident, the relevant Police Station detained Zhuang and brought her to the First Special District Local Court for

Initial Interrogation

At that time, she confessed to secretly placing Adilin pills in the pot. However, during the continued trial, she suddenly recanted her previous confession. The court ordered that Zhuang be detained, and the residue from the pot was sent to the Public Works Department Chemical Laboratory for analysis. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued investigation of the case. Judge Huang Risheng opened the Third Criminal Court and ordered that Zhuang be brought to the court for further questioning. However, according to the statement of Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, the evidence in the case was still

Undergoing Chemical Analysis

And not yet completed, so he requested an adjournment of the trial. Judge Huang granted the request and ordered that the trial be adjourned until Saturday, and the defendant Zhuang was ordered to remain in custody. At this moment, in the third row of seats in the courtroom's gallery, a woman of about thirty years old, of medium height and well-dressed, suddenly changed her normal state. At first, her eyes were fixed and her mouth was agape, as if in a stupor, and she fell onto the seat. Then, her fingers twitched, her skin was ice-cold, and she opened her mouth to shout

"Wise Judge, Save Me!"

Repeatedly. She also kept saying "Medicine pot, medicine pot," and made gestures with her hands to show the size of the medicine pot, as well as other postures. Someone who recognized the woman said that she was Gu Cai, the niece of the poisoned Zhuang Xu. Listening to the sound she was making and watching her movements, they resembled the tone and posture of the deceased. It must be possession by a wronged soul. In an instant

Nearby Seats Were in Uproar

The entire courtroom's gaze was focused on Gu Cai alone. Judge Huang believed that courtroom order should not be disrupted and ordered the bailiffs to carry this distraught woman out of the courtroom. Unexpectedly, the woman's weight suddenly increased, and one or two bailiffs could not move her. They had to join three or four to support her. Those who witnessed the scene warned the woman, saying that if it was indeed

Possession by a Wronged Soul

Then she should possess the body of the murderer when the court session was opened on another day to reveal the truth. As soon as they finished speaking, the woman's weight seemed to decrease greatly, and those who were supporting her were able to carry her out of the courtroom calmly and accompanied her home. However, it remains to be seen whether this bizarre performance by the woman was truly a case of so-called possession by a wronged soul, or a psychological abnormality of someone suffering from a nervous breakdown.

### Selling Abortifacient Pills, Police Prosecute

Wanjintang Pharmacy at No. 215 Guangxi Road was found to be selling麝香子宮丸 (Musk Uterus Pills), advertised as abortifacients, and abortifacient plasters. Chen Yonggui and Huang Cifu, detectives from the Laozha Police Station, purchased one serving of each for six yuan. After analysis by the Public Works Department, it was determined that the drugs contained unusually strong stimulants. Those who took them might not have an abortion, but their health would be harmed. Therefore, this type of business was not permitted by law. The police then filed a lawsuit against Zhang Wannian, the Tianjin native owner of the store, in the First Special District Local Court, requesting punishment under Articles 292 and 191 of the Criminal Law. Judge Zhong Qing opened the court yesterday morning to summon the defendant Zhang Wannian, but he failed to appear. After the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the case, the court ordered that he be summoned again.

### Japanese National Causes Accident While Driving Without a License

Chinese Pedestrian's Head Run Over

At 1:40 PM on the 27th, a certain Japanese national was driving a car on Jing'an Temple Road, opposite the Grand Theater, when he knocked down a Chinese pedestrian. The car wheel ran over him, and the driver tried to speed away. However, a Western chief detective saw it, stood in the road, and stopped the car. He then sent the injured person to Renji Hospital for treatment and took the Japanese driver and three passengers to the Xinzha Police Station for questioning. They were allowed to return temporarily, but the car, license plate number 9256, was detained at the police station. It is said that the car is owned by a Japanese national. As for the Japanese driver, he did not have a license and tried to flee the scene after causing the accident. A lawsuit will be filed with the Japanese Consulate. The injured Chinese pedestrian has a fractured skull, but although the injuries are serious, his life is not in danger.

### Young Man Arrested for Swindling Escort Girl of Jewelry

Chen Meimei, a local woman, 23 years old, living at No. 97, Lloyd Road, worked as an escort girl at顯風嚮導社 (Xianfeng Escort Agency) at No. 8 Leyu Lane, Yunfu Road. On August 17th last year, she was hired by a Feng surname to accompany him to a room at the China Hotel at No. 722 Guizhou Road. After spending the night, the next morning, the Feng surname and the escort girl went to the Xinxin Restaurant Tea Room on Nanjing Road for breakfast. Unexpectedly, the guest forced Chen to drink several cups of wine. Chen, who was not good at drinking, could not withstand the alcohol and immediately fell asleep at the table, unconscious. At this time, the guest took off Chen's two gold rings, worth more than fifty yuan, and fled. After Chen woke up, the Feng surname was nowhere to be found, so she reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station and asked them to investigate, but there was no trace of him. It was not until the day before yesterday that Chen ran into the guest on the road and called for Chinese detective Wang Shanqing, who arrested him and took him to the police station. Under questioning, he revealed his name to be Lin Genbao (29 years old, from Changzhou). The two rings had been exchanged for 47 yuan at the Xinfengxiang Silver Shop on Nanjing Road. Yesterday, he was taken to the First Criminal Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the case and charged him with fraud under Article 328 of the Criminal Law, stating that it had been found that the defendant had committed many similar cases and was currently under investigation, so he requested an adjournment for further questioning. Lin only admitted to borrowing from Chen and denied fraud. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and ordered Lin to be detained for further questioning. During yesterday's hearing, Zhao Huifang, an escort girl from the Yang Guifei Escort Agency, was also in court and claimed that she had also been cheated out of gold rings, a watch, and other items by Lin.

### Gambling Den Robbed

One Porter Killed

Two Gamblers Injured

At a certain gambling den near the Texaco Oil Depot in Gaoqiao Cao Town, Pudong, suddenly more than twenty thugs, carrying eight Mauser pistols and three rifles, broke in at around 9:00 PM the night before last. They immediately took out their guns to scare and prevent anyone from making a sound, locking all the gamblers in a room, where several thugs guarded them with guns. They then ransacked the gambling den, taking all the legal tender on the gambling tables and the legal tender stored in the accounting room. Later, they also took all the legal tender in the pockets of each gambler. At that time, Yu Shiyuan (42 years old), a Texaco Oil Depot porter from Ningbo, resisted slightly and was shot several times by the thugs, killing him on the spot. Stray bullets injured two people. Feng Liangcai (40 years old), from Jiangbei, was injured in the left hand. Gan Fuqing (41 years old), from Jiangbei, was injured in the lower back, bleeding profusely.

### Rumor That Shi Xiaozan is Afraid of Death: Fortifications Built Around Puppet Government, Plans to Build 40 Small Forts, Planned by Puppet Land Bureau and Japanese Army

(Special Report from This Newspaper) Shi Xiaozan, the puppet mayor of Shanghai, is the most timid of a group of puppets. Last winter, he was assassinated once in the puppet government. Although he was not hit at the time, he has been frightened ever since. After the recent series of anti-traitor incidents, Shi is even more terrified. In order to seek preventive measures, he specially suggested to the Japanese side to build fortifications in the area near the puppet government to ensure safety. It is heard that the Japanese side has agreed to this. It is planned to build 40 small forts around the puppet government. The puppet Land Bureau and the Japanese army engineering team are currently planning it.

### Murderer Appeals, Recants Confession, Sentence Increased, Original Sentence of 20 Years Imprisonment Did Not Show Remorse, Changed to Life Imprisonment to Show Deterrence

The bandit Shi Xiaodi, 28 years old, from Chongming, on the morning of November 4th last year, at around 1:00 AM, led a gang with sharp knives to the Yu Xing Pier outside Xiaodongdou in the French Concession to rob a pier boat parked there, claiming to be searching for opium. The boat's crewman, Xiao Gui (43 years old) from Ningbo, resisted, and Shi stabbed him in a vital area, causing his death without medical treatment. Shi was caught on the spot by the patrol police and sent to the Second Special Court, which filed a public prosecution against him for robbery and murder. The first instance sentenced Shi Xiaodi to 20 years of imprisonment. However, Shi did not accept the sentence and appealed to the High Third Branch Court, completely recanting his previous confession in hopes of exonerating himself. The joint collegiate panel of the High Third Branch Court concluded that Shi's crime was heinous, and that the original sentence of only 20 years of imprisonment did not show any remorse. He still hoped to exonerate himself by recanting his confession, which was even more hateful. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, Court President Wu Tingqi, together with Judges Wang Tie and He Jingcen, opened the court and overturned the original sentence, changing Shi Xiaodi's sentence to life imprisonment and depriving him of his civil rights for life. During the appeal period to the Third Instance Court, he will remain in custody in the detention center.

### Young Man and Woman Commit Suicide by Poisoning in Hotel

At around 11:40 PM last night, the tea server at the Yong'an Hotel on Route Macgregor and Chengde Road discovered groaning sounds coming from Room 14. He went to knock on the door, but there was no response for a long time. He then found a way to open the door and investigate, and saw a male and female traveler lying in bed, both pale and unconscious. Empty bottles of poison were left on the pillow. Knowing that they had committed suicide by poisoning, he reported it to the police station, which sent a car to send the man to Tongren Hospital and the woman to Guangren Hospital for separate treatment. However, because they were deeply poisoned, it was impossible to inquire about the details. Their situation is very critical. A subsequent investigation revealed only that the man's name was Wang Wenbing, 25 years old, and the woman's last name was Jiang. The rest is unknown and is still under investigation.

### Morphine Seized in Baifu Lane, Huanlong Road, Five Suspects Arrested

After receiving the information, the police immediately ordered detectives to go to the address to secretly seize the suspects. They arrested a Korean woman, two White Russians, and two Chinese men on the spot. They also found a large amount of morphine in the room, estimated to be worth ten thousand dollars. They took the people and items to the police station for temporary detention, pending interrogation by the court. They are also tracking down the principal offender to bring him to justice.

Mr. Wen Lanting, a respected elder in this city, is well-known in the business community and is enthusiastic about public welfare and charity. He is a respected senior with high moral character, admired by Chinese and foreigners. March 5th of this year is Mr. Wen's 70th birthday. Celebrities from all walks of life, including Xu Jingren, Yan Junren, Yu Qiaqing, Qu Wenliu, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Xu Jiying, Huang Hanzhi, and Guan Jiongzhi, jointly launched a public celebration.

All amounts exceeding the limit will be returned. The public announcement issued by Mr. Xu and others is copied below: "It is said that great years can be achieved, but only by maintaining harmony. Slight blessings can be obtained, but only by accumulating good deeds. May your life be like the sands of the Ganges, Buddha Sakyamuni. May your years be like the character亥, people call the worthy. Respect for age is respect for virtue, and longevity is for the benefit of the people. This is why we are launching this public celebration for Mr. Wen Lanting's 70th birthday.

He has reached the age of using a cane and is celebrating his birthday. We should add years to his life and extend his life to honor the old and pay our respects. However, Mr. Wen is concerned about national affairs and the suffering of the people. He has always had a heart to help the world and declined the offer of celebration.

### Undercover Operations of De Facto Stock Exchanges

Disregarding Laws and Regulations, Selling Short and Buying Long

Mr. Wang of this city previously attempted to organize an illegal stock exchange but failed. He then planned to change to a trust company to buy and sell British and American gold notes in name but to actually operate a de facto stock exchange. This has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Mr. Wang and others have raised capital and rented the upstairs of the Guangdong Bank building as a business place, named it the Data Communications Trust Company, with Mr. Wang as the manager. He is actively carrying out his plan and has requested government registration. Formal major merchants in Shanghai believe that the government controls foreign exchange, and the buying and selling of British and American gold notes is the business of the currency exchange industry and is illegal. The company has expanded its scope and is becoming increasingly reckless, selling short and buying long, further disregarding laws and regulations. An e-mail has been sent to the Ministry of Finance instructing the Shanghai Accountants Association not to forward the request to avoid the proliferation of de facto stock exchanges disrupting the entire foreign exchange market.

Special Edition for Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Education Group's Fundraising for Refugee Production Education Funds

### Review and Outlook of the Association's Preparations

— Xi Yushu

For the purpose of raising funds for refugee production and education, this association has planned a fundraising campaign for refugee production and education. With the enthusiastic initiation of leaders in education and culture, several preparatory meetings have been held, and presidents of universities, middle and primary schools have been invited to meetings. It has been unanimously agreed that instilling education in refugees and training them in productive skills is a matter of utmost urgency. Colleagues in the education and culture sectors have a responsibility to take on this task. Therefore, office personnel were mutually elected to actively proceed with preparations. Originally, it was intended to complete preparations in the shortest possible time and start fundraising on February 18th, with a target of 100,000 yuan. During the Lunar New Year, students would be encouraged to donate their savings from candies and New Year's money to support refugee production and education, transforming unproductive consumption into effective use, thereby inspiring social figures to generously donate and fostering students' sympathy for refugees. The association would produce a "The Greatest Joy is Doing Good" commemorative badge, given to anyone who donates one yuan, along with an established reward system to promote benevolence. However, due to the delayed start of the school year in some schools, the fundraising campaign was postponed to begin on March 1st, lasting for ten days. Thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of colleagues in the education and culture sectors and the active response from all walks of life, the number of "Doing Good" badges already claimed has exceeded 80,000. From small beginnings to significant achievements, the collective will creates a fortress. The numbers will undoubtedly be even more impressive. It is not unrealistic to expect that the original target will be surpassed. Based on my limited knowledge, I humbly offer four points, hoping to encourage colleagues in education and culture, as well as people from all walks of life, and also to encourage myself.

(1) Since this fundraising campaign was initiated voluntarily by the education and culture sectors, it is hoped that all education and culture professionals will participate to ensure its success. In the past, criticism has been directed at some colleagues who disregarded social welfare efforts. Regrettably, a small number did not participate in this campaign. During meetings, there were suggestions to publish a notice urging them to participate. However, it was generally believed that the education sector comprises knowledgeable intellectuals who are aware of social issues. In promoting all social undertakings, the education sector itself must clearly recognize its responsibilities. It was feared that the association's preparations were too hasty and that notification may not have been thorough. Therefore, it was decided to send staff to liaise individually to help ensure success. This is a message to schools that have not yet participated. Schools that have already participated in fundraising are also encouraged to uphold the spirit of universal fraternity, maximize fundraising efforts so that every school can be rewarded, and avoid perfunctory or superficial efforts.

(2) Since schools at all levels are encouraging students to donate, it is earnestly hoped that principals and faculty members will also take the lead and donate according to their ability, thereby setting an example. Otherwise, if only students or their parents and relatives are solicited, without the active participation and leadership of the faculty, the name of this group, the Education Group Fundraising Committee, will not match reality. This is a message to the faculty of all schools.

(3) This group believes that university students have higher levels of knowledge and ability than middle school students. Therefore, university students should raise more funds than middle school students. Middle school students have higher levels of knowledge and ability than primary school students. Therefore, middle school students should raise more funds than primary school students. In the past, people in society believed that primary school students were the most enthusiastic about patriotism, followed by middle school students, and then university students. This kind of assessment was originally abstract. This campaign is a concrete test of this abstract assessment. Hopefully, this assessment will be proven wrong, to avoid the criticism that "the higher the knowledge and ability, the lower the compassion." This is a message to students at all levels.

(4) This group initiated fundraising for refugee production and education, promoting student fundraising in the city. The main aim is to enable refugees to have the ability to live like us, and for refugee children to have the opportunity to receive education like our children. It is hoped that parents of all students will embrace the spirit of "The Greatest Joy is Doing Good" and jointly witness the success of this charitable endeavor. The association will separately establish a reward system. Students who donate or raise 10 yuan or more will be awarded a certificate by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. Those who donate over 100 yuan will receive a certificate plus a souvenir from Mr. Yu Qiaqing, the chairman of the board. It is hoped that parents of students can all understand the profound significance of this and serve as role models for young people in doing good, jointly contributing to its success, which would be most fortunate.

### Why is Doing Good the Greatest Joy?

— Chen Jicheng

What is good? Initially, it is a matter of personal advantage and disadvantage. What benefits oneself is considered good, and what harms oneself is considered bad. Later, considerations of praise and blame arise. What is praised by the majority is considered good, and what is condemned by the majority is considered bad. Ultimately, the boundaries between self and others are eliminated. What is sympathetic to the interests of others is considered good, and the opposite is considered bad.

People cannot avoid taking action in life. If benefiting oneself is considered good, then what one person considers good may not be considered good by another. When personal interests clash in the mind, good and evil become unclear. If good and evil are judged based on the praise and blame of the majority, opinions will differ across time, place, and culture. Praise and blame cannot be forcibly unified, so how can there be a definitive conclusion on good and evil? Only when the boundaries between self and others are eliminated can the distinction between good and evil become clear. As the sages said, "Extend oneself to others; share goodness with others." This is true goodness.

What is joy? Initially, it is thought that indulging the desires of the eyes and ears is joy. Since joy cannot last long, one then aims for the happiness of a lifetime. However, this is close to selfishness. When considering public opinion, one's heart is uneasy. Therefore, only by disregarding personal gain, not worrying about praise or blame, and having a clear conscience can one achieve true joy.

When people do good deeds, their hearts often have a sense of satisfaction. Satisfaction leads to happiness. If one does bad deeds, one feels regret and shame, and one's heart becomes uneasy. When one sees others doing good deeds, one admires them and thinks about emulating them. When one sees others doing bad deeds, one hates them and thinks about self-admonishment. This is the norm of human nature. Therefore, only by doing good can one find joy, only doing good is true joy, and only doing good is the greatest joy.

Now, governance in the suburbs of Shanghai has been absent for over a year. Over 100,000 refugees remain, suffering from hunger and cold, a truly pitiable sight. Even foreigners express sympathy. How can we, as fellow countrymen, not feel sorrow? Historically, Chinese charitable undertakings have mostly focused on providing sustenance but not education. Social welfare organizations have provided care for orphans and the elderly, and family clans have established charitable estates to aid the poor. Beyond providing for basic needs, little else has been offered. Providing food and clothing is already commendable, and it is difficult to expect both sustenance and education to be provided. Maintaining the current situation while also considering the future is challenging. If we save one person today and feel great joy, but tomorrow that person cannot sustain themselves, and we look back and see that we lack the power to help and sit idly by, then our virtue is incomplete, and our hearts cannot be at peace. Where is the joy? Therefore, those who save people must also provide them with life skills and knowledge. In times of national crisis, engaging in production is enough for self-sufficiency. When the national crisis is over, they can return to their hometowns with the ability to support themselves. Such good deeds are endlessly joyful.

When the Education Group of this association started raising funds for refugee production and education and promoting the "Doing Good" badges, these thoughts were expressed.

### Refugee Production and Education

— Wu Zhiqian

Since the outbreak of war in Shanghai, refugees have gathered in the concessions. Aside from those who have been relocated inland by various parties, no less than 100,000 refugees remain housed in various shelters. Surviving the flames of war, they seek refuge on this isolated island. Their faces are gaunt, and their necks are thin, a sight that evokes compassion. Although benevolent philanthropists have raised funds to provide sustenance, temporary relief from hunger and cold seems assured. However, the days ahead are long. What will happen in the future? To seek a fundamental solution, it is not enough to merely clothe and feed them. These refugees are not all frail and elderly or ignorant children who need to be taken care of. There are many who are in their prime and strong enough to support themselves. If we do not distinguish between them and merely offer warmth and kindness, clothing them when they are cold and feeding them when they are hungry, will we not be fostering their dependence and creating countless idle vagrants? In this regard, what is the value of such passive relief? Therefore, refugee relief should be approached actively, focusing not only on their safety in terms of clothing and food but also on providing education tailored to their abilities, enabling them to develop their productive capacity. Every person has inherent abilities, and each can earn a living through their labor. Refugees are also people. Those who are old and weak can hardly be expected to work, and young children need to be nurtured and educated, and they are unable to engage in production. However, those who are in their prime, strong and healthy, whether male or female, should not be allowed to sit idly by, consuming resources without contributing. They should be taught skills and guided towards productive endeavors, so that their clothing and food needs are met through their own labor. The refugees themselves will have a skill that allows them to be self-sufficient, and the country will have more productive members. Even if a great disaster is quelled in the future and the refugees return to their hometowns, they can use their skills to earn a living, without relying on others, and the country will avoid endless hidden dangers. Therefore, promoting refugee production and education is a matter that cannot be delayed. Now, the Shanghai Relief Association, recognizing this, is working with the education and cultural sectors of this city to implement refugee production and education. This is truly a great undertaking of active relief. Although the environment in Shanghai is unique, those engaged in refugee relief work are doing their best, contributing their heart, effort, and resources. They dare not lag behind others in their love for the country. We, the people of the education and culture sectors, also often follow in the footsteps of others, fulfilling our responsibilities as citizens. We believe that inspiring refugee production and education is even more important. Since the Relief Association has taken the initiative, our education and cultural sectors should support them, so that the plan can be realized as soon as possible. Duty cannot be shirked, and responsibility cannot be evaded. However, when everyone works together, even heavy burdens become light. Shanghai has no shortage of benevolent people who will surely rise up in response and strongly support its success. We will wait and see.

### Several Opinions on Refugee Education

— Ya Bao

Shanghai's refugee education has been able to achieve great results with minimal funding because of the capable leadership, which is a well-known fact and worthy of our praise. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, an education group has been set up specifically to handle refugee education matters, carefully planning and actively promoting it. In the near future, Shanghai's refugee education will surely have greater development. Based on my limited knowledge, I would like to offer a few opinions for the reference of colleagues engaged in refugee education.

Regarding the content of refugee education, the main content of refugee education is nothing more than civic education, literacy education, and vocational education. While these three aspects of education should be conducted simultaneously without neglecting any of them, we believe that civic education and vocational education seem particularly important, and they are also more difficult to implement. The importance of civic education and vocational education seems to need no further explanation. Civic training cannot have assigned homework like teaching national language and arithmetic, but must be effective through subtle influence. The environment in which the students are placed, the attitudes of the managers and teachers are all major factors in transforming character, and the latter is particularly important. Managers and teachers should lead by example, be serious, fair, and enthusiastic in their work, be able to work together in harmony, live a disciplined life, and be able to self-criticize. These are the minimum requirements. Vocational education is even more difficult to manage. The sales of products and the future prospects of students all become serious problems. However, since we recognize the importance of vocational education, we cannot fail to do it simply because it is difficult. I think that the purpose of running vocational education is not to make money in the present, but to enable refugees to learn a skill for life in order to find a way out in the future.

Regarding refugee education facilities, there are several important principles regarding refugee education facilities. The first is the unity of management and education. That is to say, management and education should be integrated, or at least cooperate with each other, and proceed towards the same goal. Education should extend to the entire life of the educated, not just in class. This is the ideal of life education. It is more difficult to implement the ideal of life education in ordinary schools, because the entire life of students is not under the guidance of the school. However, refugees in shelters are under the guidance of the organizers in their daily life, diet, and all activities. It is truly the most ideal place to implement life education. We should not divide management and education into two separate things and carry them out independently, but should integrate them and make all management facilities contain educational implications.

Second, pay attention to the practice of behavior. We must not repeat the mistakes of general school education, focusing on book education and neglecting the practice of behavior. Civic training is not about being able to recite items and give answers, but about having an impact on the behavior of the educated to be considered successful. Understanding the structure of the human body and the function of each part does not mean that the goal of hygiene education has been achieved. It is necessary to practice a healthy life to be considered successful.

Third, pay attention to the autonomy of the educated. All learning is automatic, not passive. The purpose of education is to teach people to educate themselves. Managers and technicians should be in a guiding position and should not replace the refugees in handling all matters and making all decisions.

Regarding refugee education administration, it seems that the education work in the shelters run by various charities is not yet unified. This is a very regrettable thing. If the administration is not unified, the efficiency of work will be affected. For example, it is best to centralize the recruitment and dismissal of teachers, and it is best to standardize the treatment of teachers. This is to improve the effectiveness of refugee education. We hope that this can be done.

The chairman of the committee, Xi Yushu, and others, gave a broadcast speech at the New New Radio Station last night, urging the cultural and student communities of the city to unite and work hard to save the refugees. The details are recorded below:

Universal Promotion in All Schools in the City

Since the association advocated the "Doing Good" badge fundraising to raise funds for refugee production and education, the city's major primary and secondary schools have successively applied to participate. Those who went to the Shanghai Bank to collect the "Doing Good" badges have been coming one after another in recent days. A unified and universal promotion will be carried out from today onwards. It is expected that the target of 100,000 yuan will be quickly completed. However, the association only hopes that students from all schools will use their spare time after class to make voluntary donations to their relatives and friends with the kindness of fellow countrymen. It is absolutely forbidden to publicly solicit donations on the road or in public places to avoid disturbing order. The association also hopes that all schools will deposit the donated funds into the Shanghai Bank at any time. If there are still many "Doing Good" badges left after one week, they should be returned to the association immediately for redistribution to other schools in need.

Generous Support from Chinese and Foreign Individuals

In addition to the nearly 80,000 "Doing Good" badges that have been claimed by various schools in recent days, Chinese and foreign individuals have also generously donated. When broadcasting at the New New Radio Station last night, donations from all walks of life were very enthusiastic. There were Guo Shun with 500 yuan, Zhou Bangjun, Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, Jiang Yiping and others with 100 yuan each, Shen Changgeng with 200 yuan, and no less than dozens of other donations. Xi Yushu also donated 100 yuan on the spot. In addition, foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson and Swire have also expressed their support for the association's refugee production and education fundraising campaign and have been conducting fundraising among their colleagues.

Shanghai Bank Collects Donations on Behalf

According to the association's estimates, a donation of one yuan can provide one refugee with one semester of schooling, or enable a refugee to learn a useful skill. It is expected that benevolent people will sympathize and participate. Anyone who donates one yuan to a nearby school or the following banks will receive a "Doing Good" badge. More donations will result in more badges, which are most welcome to be given to relatives and friends. The addresses of the Shanghai Bank's head office and branches that collect donations on behalf are listed below: (1) Ningbo Road Jiangxi Road Head Office Trust Department, (2) Eight Immortals Bridge Branch (YMCA), (3) Jing'an Temple Road Branch (Tongfu Road Corner), (4) Avenue Joffre Branch (Opposite West of Paris Theater), (5) Yuyuan Road Branch (Paramount Building)

Enthusiastic Donation from Daoming Girls' Middle School

Daoming Girls' Middle School, Primary School, Kindergarten, and Women's Supplementary School on Avenue Haig are usually very enthusiastic about social justice. This time, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Education Group is fundraising for refugee production education. The school authorities took 1,000 "Doing Good" badges from the Shanghai Bank back to the school yesterday. As soon as the report was made at the time, students donated one after another, and they immediately donated 417 yuan in national currency. Among them, Shen Meiting, a graduate of the second year of junior high school, Shen Yongqiang, a student of the third grade of primary school, and Zhang Qiaoyun, a student of the second year of primary school, each donated 10 yuan, and Huang Aizhen, a student of the fourth year of primary school, donated 5 yuan, which were the most enthusiastic. Extrapolating from this, it will not be difficult for the school's 1,000 "Doing Good" badges to be fully donated within a few days, and there is no need to worry about the 200,000 badges in the entire city being shelved. This is truly the only gospel for the refugees since the New Year.

### Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center, Relief for Out-of-School Children

Registration for Poor Children Begins Next Semester

And prepare for poor children's recuperation and other matters

The Shanghai Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center was initiated and organized by people with enthusiasm for social welfare in the city, such as Xu Xiaochu and Chen Kecheng. Zhang Guoquan was elected as the director. Since its establishment, 100 children have been relieved and admitted to school. In order to expand the relief for out-of-school children, children who request to be admitted to school next semester will be able to register soon. They will also contact the Refugee Relief Association to transfer the children from each shelter to various schools. The details are recorded below:

Relief Steps The relief steps of the center are divided into three phases. The first phase is to register out-of-school children, and the center will bear the education costs and send them to various primary schools to study. The second phase is to run its own school to concentrate and train out-of-school poor children, implement vocational education, and introduce them to employment after graduation. The third phase is to set up a special training class to train holistic education. The current implementation is still a preliminary measure.

Strict Examination The center conducts strict supervision on the children who are relieved and admitted to school. Each semester, parents are convened for training and encouraged to teach their children. Staff members are also sent to various schools every day to inspect the relief students. Concentrated training is held every Sunday, concentrated guidance is held every second week, and concentrated examinations and various competitions are held every month. Various homework tests are held every semester.

Future Plans The center also plans to set up out-of-school children's remedial night schools, children's libraries, poor children's sanatoriums, poor children's skills training centers, production guidance centers, and other undertakings. The various shelters in the city, in view of the fact that they provide primary education to the sheltered children, but they are not school institutions and cannot issue certificates, so they cooperate with the center. The refugees in the fifth grade requested the center to relieve them and send them to primary school to complete their primary school graduation qualifications. The refugees in Dunxin Shelter have been relieved by the center this semester.

### School Overview: Shanghai Women's Tutoring School

The Shanghai Women's Tutoring School is specially designed for adult women who have dropped out of school, women preparing for employment, and girls preparing for further education. It was founded in August 1932 by Zhou Zhenshao, based on his many years of research in social education. Recognizing that it is difficult for adult women who have dropped out of school to be with children in elementary school, and difficult to keep up with the level of secondary school, and that elementary and secondary schools have full-day classes and many subjects, which are not suitable for the environment and needs of adult women, he established the school. Over the past seven years, he has worked hard to operate and constantly improve the school. The school buildings have gradually expanded, the equipment has become more perfect, and the number of students has increased year by year. There are now more than 1,500 students. The first school is located at 54 Hualong Road, and the second school is located at 630 Baik Road. The transportation is convenient and the environment is beautiful. The school emphasizes the importance of being careful in appointing teachers, and confirms them only after extensive trials. All teaching materials are compiled by the school itself as much as possible to ensure their applicability. It is the only women's education institution in Shanghai, and one of the few women's schools in the country. It offers elective courses, including Chinese, Mandarin conversation, English, English conversation, Japanese, Arithmetic, Bookkeeping, Piano, Typing, Sewing, and Embroidery. Each subject is graded according to proficiency. Students can choose classes in the morning or afternoon. The general courses are divided into elementary, junior high, and senior high school. The vocational courses are divided into elementary, advanced, and domestic affairs. There are also special courses, including Women's Law, Medicine and Hygiene, Family Education, Family Bookkeeping, Family Electricity, Nursing, Family Application, Current Affairs Research, Calligraphy Research, Weaving, Flower Making, Harmonica, Singing, Peking Opera, and Spoken Drama, all of which are practical subjects suitable for women's needs. Dormitories are also available for students who live far away. The school is very serious about civic training, vocational training, domestic affairs training, and various organizations. The school seeks only practical effort and rarely advertises, contributing greatly to society and benefiting women significantly.

Zhou Shoushen's Letter: Mr. Guiyong of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, I received your telegram. I recently received a letter from Mr. Li Huitang, stating that he was unable to attend due to objections from the media. I have attached the original letter and a letter from the Hong Kong Press Association to Mr. Huitang. It is a pity that he was unable to participate due to the constraints of the environment. I will definitely be able to serve if there is an opportunity in the future. I am returning this letter to you, and I wish you all the best. Zhou Shoushen, February 28th.

Li Huitang's Letter: In reply, I have received two letters, and I have listened to your kind words. I am deeply moved by your enthusiasm for relief. I was asked to take time to go north to participate in the charity football match. If my small skill can benefit the victims, I would be more than happy to do so. However, the Hong Kong media has strongly criticized my trip to the north, and I have had to reluctantly cancel it. I think Mr. Zhou Jueshen and Mr. Hengzhi have explained the situation. I am deeply sorry that I have wasted so much of your time because of me. However, the circumstances are such that I have to go against my wishes. I hope you will forgive my difficulties. If there is still an opportunity to serve in the future, I will do my best to help. I am writing to inform you of this and wish you all the best. To the Shanghai International Relief Committee, Your humble servant, Li Huitang, February 14th.

In the last Games, the Chinese Race Walking Association of this city was in charge of selecting Cai Zhengyi, Zhou Yuyu, Zhang Zaojiu, and Zheng Chengshan to participate in the competition in Germany. Cai Zhengyi won the 19th place among more than 80 athletes from more than 20 countries. According to Lyu Wenxia, a member of the Chinese Race Walking Association, the reporter said yesterday that we have decided to send people to participate in this World Games. Therefore, last year, the association continued to hold the fifth Chinese Open Race Walking Competition in preparation for joining. In addition to notifying members to intensify their hard training, he also sent letters to Zhang Zaojiu and Cai Zhengyi, who are currently in Hong Kong, to prepare as soon as possible. At present, there are more and more people practicing race walking in this city, and there is a phenomenon of restoring the past vigor. Zhou Yuyu's 10,000-meter result has reached within 50 minutes. With more than a year of practice, the results will be even better. Mr. Lyu also said that this World Games will participate in the 50,000-meter and the newly added 10,000-meter events.

### Current Situation of the Western League Football: Lido Stands Out in Group C: Donghua Reigns Supreme in Reserves: No Major Developments in Group A

Since the start of the Western League football season, the cup matches have reached the final stages, and the league matches have also entered the second round. Currently, in Group A, the Seaforth Highlanders still occupy the top spot, closely followed by the Donghua Association. There have been no major changes. In the reserve group, although Donghua is currently in second place, they have not suffered any defeats and are still virgins, so they will definitely reign supreme in this group sooner or later. The championship also seems to belong to them. In Group B, although North Tong is in first place, the British Navy has played one less game and only has one point less. Therefore, if the British Navy wins one more game, it can surpass North Tong and jump to the top spot. The Chinese team Qinghua is in eighth place. In Group C, Lido stands out from the crowd, with seven wins in seven games, scoring 14 goals, averaging more than a dozen goals per game, and conceding only three goals, which is a great record. The championship has already been claimed. The last-place Shengguang team has four losses in four games and only one goal, which is similar to Lido in a different way.

Guoguang is only slightly behind Hualian in the league. However, Hualian's strength is still superior to Guoguang's, so it is predicted that Hualian will defeat Guoguang.

### Finance: Northern Banks Sell Heavily, Cash Fluctuations are Drastic: Lowest at 2250 Yuan, Later Bought Back by Hong Kong Banks

Yesterday, the market situation for cash speculation fluctuated wildly again, and the whole day was in an extremely chaotic situation. Generally, it showed a trend of a sharp decline followed by a sudden surge. It all depended on buying and selling. Initially, the price of gold had risen unprecedentedly for seven consecutive days, with a total surge of 104 yuan. Therefore, when the decline started, there were quite a few people taking profits. In addition, securities firms and a certain broker flooded the market on behalf of Tianjin banks, and buyers were absent for a while, causing the price to plummet. It once fell to a minimum of 2115 yuan. After 10:10 AM, news of a slight tightening of the overseas market boosted morale, and buying became more active. At the same time, Hong Kong banks entrusted a certain silver shop and a certain money exchange to search for purchases, and continued to push forward at a certain money exchange shop, causing the price to rebound sharply. However, it eventually fell by 26 yuan. People's hearts were tired and then firm, and transactions were very active. Silver shop jewelry also fluctuated, first falling and then rising, changing five times in one day. In the end, it fell by 3 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to decline slightly.

### Cash Falls 26 Yuan

In the morning, the securities firms initially shouted a selling price of 2160 yuan per tael (ten taels), but most buyers were waiting and watching, so no transactions were made for a long time. Until 9:45 AM, 50 taels were sold by the securities firms to the silver shops at an opening price of 2158 yuan. After the opening, the securities firms still had a strong desire to sell, but there was a shortage of buyers, causing the price to fall sharply. Securities firms sold 50 taels to money exchanges for 45 yuan, and money exchanges sold 50 taels to silver shops at the same price. Later, securities firms sold another 50 taels to silver shops for 36 yuan. After that, there was a greater shortage of buyers, and a certain money exchange had a strong desire to sell, so the price could not be supported and fell by more than 20 yuan. A certain money exchange sold 50 taels each to silver shops and gold shops, with 15 yuan being the lowest price. At that time, news of a slight tightening of foreign exchange boosted morale, and buying became active. A certain money exchange stopped selling and turned to buying, rebounding and rising. A certain money exchange bought 50 taels from the securities firms, jumping to 35 yuan. After that, the securities firms continued to have a desire to sell, repeatedly weakening the price. However, at that time, a certain silver shop suddenly absorbed a large amount on behalf of Hong Kong banks, and the market became firm. A certain silver shop bought 50 taels from the securities firms for 27 yuan, and then bought 50 taels from the money exchanges for 29 yuan, and then bought another 50 taels from the money exchanges for 30 yuan. Not long after, a certain broker also sold on behalf of Tianjin banks, selling 100 taels to the silver shops for 29 yuan. A certain silver shop bought another 50 taels from the money exchanges for 28 yuan, and a certain broker sold another 50 taels to the silver shops at the same price. Later, the gold shops traded 50 taels with each other for 26 yuan. Near noon, the money exchanges traded 50 taels with each other for 30 yuan as the closing price for the morning. In the afternoon, the situation was firm and stable. First, the silver shops bought 50 taels from the money exchanges for 32 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange searched for more than 100 taels on behalf of Hong Kong banks, at prices of 32 yuan and 34 yuan, which were supplied by the silver shops and other firms. Finally, the money exchanges traded 50 taels with each other for 2134 yuan as the closing price for the evening, a drop of 26 yuan compared to the previous day (a difference of 43 yuan for the whole day). It was heard that a certain money exchange still wanted to search for purchases after closing. Although the price was raised to 36 yuan, it was still difficult to find a counterparty, so no transactions were made. The selling price of the cash shop's own-brand gold was 2140 yuan, and the buying price was 2125 yuan. The current standard gold is quoted 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and no transactions have been made.

### Jewelry Gold Changes Five Times

The selling price of silver shop jewelry per tael initially remained unchanged. Until 9:50 AM, due to the downward trend of speculation, it was also lowered by 1 yuan. Not long after, it was lowered by another 2 yuan. At 10:05 AM, it was lowered by another 2 yuan. Later, at 10:10 AM, due to the rebound of speculation, it also rebounded by 1 yuan. Finally, at 2:50 PM, it rebounded by another 1 yuan. Datonghang and Laoqingyun changed to 216 yuan, and Xinhanghang was 214 yuan, with a buying price of 208 yuan.

### Pure Gold Drops Another Halfpenny

A London telegram on the 27th stated that English pure gold continued to fall by half a penny per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 2 pence, causing the central bank's Chinese cash purchase price to also decrease to 1209 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed Customs gold was also lowered by 2 li, or 2 yuan and 3 jiao and 9 fen. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 3 jiao, or 1204 yuan and 9 jiao.

### Foreign Exchange Tightens Then Returns to Normal: Foreign Firms Settle Accounts at the End of the Month: HSBC Still Has a Supply

The foreign exchange market yesterday was affected by the end of the month, so the settlement of accounts by major foreign firms such as Texaco increased, and there was no supply from Hong Kong telegraphs. In addition, foreign banks had a limited desire to sell, resulting in a tight undercurrent. The British gold once fell to 8 pence and 0.09375, and the US exchange also softened to 15 yuan and 8.125. However, the trend returned to normal due to HSBC's surge. Although there was some fluctuation that day, there were no excessive waves. The trading volume was high in the morning and turned clear in the afternoon. Although foreign firms had some involvement in Hong Kong exchange, the supply from foreign banks was still strong, so the situation remained unchanged.

In the morning, the London telegraph showed that the near-term and far-term spreads were reduced by 0.0625, the New York silver price remained stagnant, the London raw gold continued to fall by half a penny, the exchange rate of English against the US dollar fell by 9 hao, the exchange rate against the French franc fell by a small 7 centimes, and the exchange rate against Shanghai remained flat. The exchange rate of the US dollar against the English dollar fell by 25, the exchange rate against the French franc fell by 0.0625, the exchange rate against Shanghai rose by 8 fen, and the central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening selling price in the morning was 8 pence and 35 for English exchange, and 15 yuan and 875 for US exchange, which were both flat compared to the 7th. After the opening, the situation was quiet and stagnant, with little change. When the HSBC listing was announced, it did not move. When the silver balance tax was announced, it continued to fall by 5 li, accounting for 7.00%. After that, oil companies such as Texaco and other foreign firms settled their accounts one after another. The English gold settled by Maccalli, Huabi, and other banks was only 8 pence and 0.09375, and the US exchange was only 15 yuan and 8.4375 and 8.125. Therefore, the process was slightly tight. Later, the foreign bank Huayi sold 54 yuan and 375 yuan of Hong Kong exchange to a certain foreign firm, and the situation was also flat. The closing selling price of HSBC at noon was 8 pence and 125 for English exchange, and 15 yuan and 875 for US exchange. However, other foreign banks had a weak desire to supply at the closing price at noon.

The afternoon market was quiet and stagnant, and the price was stable. First, foreign firms settled 8 pence and 125 of English exchange with HSBC, and also settled 15 yuan and 8.4375 of US exchange with Huabi. Finally, foreign firms absorbed 54 yuan and 375 of Hong Kong exchange from Huayi, so the situation was quite flat. By the time the bank's closing selling price was 8 pence and 125 for English exchange and 15 yuan and 875 for US exchange, the result was no better or worse than the previous day. Hong Kong exchange also remained stagnant.

### Speculation Changes Drastically: US Gold and Pounds Fall Back by 9 Jiao

Yesterday, the English pure gold continued to fall by half a penny, the English-US exchange rate fell by 25, the settlement of accounts by foreign exchange foreign firms was very heavy, the supply from banks was smooth, the head position was loose, and the market price was stable. The speculation market showed a declining trend as soon as it opened. Later, wealthy people came out of the cage one after another, the chips were loosened, and the silver shops, money exchanges, and Hong Kong gangs all followed suit in throwing and selling, and people's hearts were very weak, reversing the excitement of the previous few days. The market price went straight down. Later, there were fewer people closing out profits, and the Tianjin gang and the Hong Kong gang took the opportunity to absorb them at low prices, and the market price slowly rebounded. Speculators tried their best to manipulate, and the transaction was very active throughout the day. Foreign currency, English and US gold pounds, followed the gold price and fell sharply. Wealthy people made profits and threw and sold them one after another, the supply turned strong, and English and US gold notes also came out of the cage, and the market price followed suit and fell slightly. However, the foreign exchange rate was stable, so most of them still stood still. Transactions were very active throughout the day. The association's turnover increased, Hengmao sold and Yongtai bought US gold notes for 500 yuan, Yitai sold and Hengmao bought US gold notes for 500 yuan, and sold and Baoxiang bought US gold notes for 200 yuan, Yikang sold and Litong bought US gold notes for 1000 yuan, and Tiancheng sold and Baoxiang bought US gold notes for 300 yuan. Yesterday's market price: the English gold pound fell by 6 jiao, the English gold note fell by 9 fen, the US gold pound fell by 9 jiao, the US gold note fell by 8 li, the Hong Kong note fell by 3 li, the French franc note fell by 3 hao, and the Singapore note and the Dutch note each fell by 1 fen. Other currencies did not change.

### Discount Continues to Rise by Half a Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for drafts continued to be high, once rising to 38 yuan per thousand yuan. At noon, it slightly returned to 37 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, and remained unchanged in the afternoon, which was half a yuan higher than the previous day.

### Large Silver Bars Narrow and Indian Silver is Flat

A London telegram on the 27th stated that speculators sold and there were limited buyers, and the market was still flat. It remained flat after closing. A few bought in at the listed price. The near-term and far-term spreads for large silver bars narrowed by 0.0625. A New York silver telegraph stated that the US silver price remained stagnant. A Mumbai silver telegram stated that Indian silver was half quiet, and the spot price and the near-term and far-term prices did not change.

### Food: Factory Flour Sales are Weak: Wheat is Also Quiet

Flour: Yesterday's trading was not active. After the market opened in the morning, the factories supplied spot goods, and suddenly felt a lack. It was proposed to add 5 fen to the guest price, and the previous disk of 4 yuan and 8 jiao was still sold. However, the goods previously ordered by the guest side were still difficult to load, so new transactions were not very strong. The total turnover of the market was about 34,500 bags for various brands of No. 2 flour, and the selling price was stable. The delivery of by-product flour was rare, and it was almost entirely absorbed by local customers. The wholesale price of No. 2 flour on this street still needs 4 yuan and 8 jiao.

Today, 3,000 bags of flour were exported to Yantai, 1,500 bags were exported to Tianjin, and 7,500 bags were exported to Shantou.

Wheat: The market transaction was as light as usual. There were few sources from various places, and the inventory in the market was thin. The factories all have foreign wheat as raw materials, so they are unwilling to release the price to absorb local wheat, resulting in an increasingly quiet market. The total turnover of the city was only 100 bags of Jiangbei wheat, with a price of 6 yuan and 8 jiao, which was handled by Fuxin Factory. Fufeng Factory has also stopped handling. It is heard that about 1,000 to 2,000 bags of goods are sent directly to the factory. The market is stable.

### Arriving Inventory is Rare: Bian Yuan Soars

Yesterday, there were more sources of Guomi rice, with more ships arriving at Hexia, totaling 10 ships, and more than 3,000 bags were transported by car. The market situation turned flat on the day before yesterday, and the opening hand yesterday morning was still not smooth. Later, large group customers took action, and this street followed suit, and people's hearts rose. The sellers counterattacked, the situation was tight, and the market was excellent. As a result, the price of thick japonica rice was flat except for the Suzhou-Tonggang gang, and the rest were all good for each. Thin indica rice in Hexia was also flat, but special steamed buns were very popular, rising by 1 jiao. Doyangjian and Bujian followed suit and did well by a few minutes to 1 jiao. Bian Yuan's inventory is rarer than other goods, and it is also rare to arrive and sell well, so it is regarded as a rare commodity, and the market sees a surge, with the price increasing by more than 3 jiao. The special ones have already opened at 16 yuan.

### Guest Indica Rice is Enquired for Export

Yesterday, the digestion of guest indica rice was particularly strong. In addition to the retail households in the street shops, the guest warehouses and the export gangs also enquired about it. 2,300 bags were traded in the morning, and nearly 3,000 bags continued to be traded in the afternoon. The market was immediately raised by 5-6 fen to nearly 1 jiao. Wuhu indica rice opened at 11 yuan and 1 jiao and 11 yuan and 1 jiao and a half, while Nanjing indica rice rose to 11 yuan and 6 jiao. The special Chongbu Jian reached 11 yuan and 8 jiao. The market atmosphere is still continuing to look good. If the export gangs continue to eat, the market may have to step up again.

### North and South Goods: Flat Branch Opening Price Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the North City store opened more than 200 boxes of Jinshan branches. The opening price of Shangzhuang flat branches was 64 yuan and 2 jiao to 63 yuan and 6 jiao. Yuanzhi goods were opened at 60 yuan and 6 jiao, which was more common. The middle-grade flat branches were returned according to the situation. Yesterday, the mixed-road red dates opened with a long red peach, and the price was 19 yuan. After the red gorgon row called up the market, more than a dozen pieces were opened yesterday, and the price was 33 yuan.

### Securities Trading
### Hesitation Remains on Public Bonds; Several Companies Issuing Dividends

Securities in the after-hours market showed a slight recovery yesterday. This was a minor correction after several days of consecutive gains. Considering the current environment, rumors of peace are circulating daily, and there are reports that new, substantial loans from the US and UK to China are likely to be established. Eventually, the market will experience a significant upturn. Yesterday's trend showed an initial rise followed by a decline, entirely influenced by the emergence of general bullish sentiment. Some believe that the government intends to issue a new ¥500 million Reconstruction Bond, hence the caution among many investors, which does not reflect the overall market sentiment. Therefore, after a slight pullback, the prospects for public bonds still appear bullish. Yesterday's trading was limited to the morning session. Initially, firms like Lemaohao and Kanghao, along with various retail investors, absorbed a significant amount of bonds. However, the inability of Series Wu and Bing to break through the ¥7 and ¥8 barriers, respectively, led to selling. Both the 7th and 46th numbers were sold off, and many bulls emerged. Number 38 took advantage of the low prices to absorb Series Bing, achieving their desired result and stabilizing the market slightly. Xie Da Hao, which had been selling previously, took the opportunity to exert further pressure, selling tens of thousands of bonds, causing the price to soften again. This caused the initial rise of three to four cents to turn into a decline of three to five cents. This situation is a market manipulation tactic, only effective for a short period. The total transaction volume was estimated at around ¥700,000. A concise table is provided below.

There was not much activity in stock trading. Dasheng Third Factory was offered at ¥37.50, but no stock was available, as the factory was rumored to be issuing a dividend of one cent, leading to high demand.

The Zhejiang Industrial Bank of this city is scheduled to distribute dividends for 1927, at an annual rate of 5%, starting on the 6th of this month.

The Jianye Real Estate Company of this city is scheduled to distribute the final dividend on the 3rd of this month. The dividend is ¥10 per share, including the interim dividend of ¥5, for a total dividend of ¥15 for 1938, equivalent to an interest rate of approximately 1.07% per week.

The Shanghai Water & Electricity Company of this city has resolved at a board meeting to distribute a dividend of 6% for 1938, which will be paid out once approved by the general meeting of shareholders.

On the 27th of last month (Monday), London's Chinese foreign currency bonds showed slight weakness. The Customs Guaranteed Sino-French US 5% bonds, printed bonds, and the British issue of the Gold Rehabilitation Public Debt each fell by half a pound, with the former priced at £66.50 and the latter at £49. The rest remained unchanged. Supply and demand were both quiet today.

On the 27th of last month (Monday), London-listed British Far East company stocks saw only the price of Mercantile Bank fall by 2 shillings and 6 pence to £9 7s 6d, with all others remaining unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton
### Floating Profits Lead to Yarn Price Decline

The yarn market has once again entered a phase of calm consolidation. However, in the afternoon of the previous day, due to high spot prices, there was a temporary surge of excitement, and the market became heated, with prices showing an upward trend and a potential for continued gains. However, at the opening of today's market, while the bullish side tried hard to maintain prices, buyers were unwilling to accept the high prices. In addition, the backlog of yarn at the port prevented the further transportation and distribution. This causes floating profits to be booked. This created a relaxed market, and prices trended downwards. 20-count Double Horse yarn traded at a low price of ¥394, while warehouse receipts traded at ¥391, and "Celestial Maiden" yarn traded at ¥30. Certain bullish interests, however, took advantage of the low prices to buy in and maintain the market, and prices saw a recovery. Few people came to the market in the afternoon, and market conditions were listless, but those holding goods demanded high prices, with few buyers willing to pay, causing prices to rise slightly. In general, yarn inventories have increased compared to the past. The situation in eastern Zhejiang has eased, with Ningbo and Wenzhou ports handling some goods and shipments. Demand in Nanhua is gradually developing.

Regarding the current situation of yarn, the market was quiet at the opening this morning. Due to the high prices, there was a general desire to sell. The buyers saw the market was flooded with spot supply so there was no rush to buy. They would only buy a few packages if the price was low, and would not buy if the price was high. Therefore, the initial price quoted by traders for 20-count Double Horse yarn was ¥397, the same as the afternoon price on the previous day, but actual transactions were stagnant. Current market has some manufactured buying to help it rise. The spot market retreated step by step, and the lowest price for Double Horse yarn was ¥394. Business was good in the afternoon, so prices rebounded by one dollar. A total of 1,780 packages were traded throughout the day. The market price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was down ¥1 from the previous day, as were Celestial Maiden, Te Jin Cheng, and Double Globe yarn. 10-count coarse yarn remained firm, with no action taken by the factories. Today, 520 bales of cotton yarn were exported to Shantou, 135 bales to Hong Kong, and 240 bales to Guangzhou Bay. The amount purchased by each region is listed below.

### Foreign Cotton Trading Halted; Domestic Cotton Also Stalling

The domestic cotton market has once again entered a sluggish phase. Factories were unwilling to purchase due to the stagnant yarn market. Because of low inventory and the scarcity of goods arriving from various regions, those who wanted to buy had no spot cotton to purchase, resulting in a hesitant state. As a result, market prices remained firm. Yesterday's market transactions were extremely scattered. The route from northern Jiangsu remains closed, and it is unlikely that goods will arrive in Shanghai before the 20th day of the first lunar month. Yesterday, over 8,000 bales of Yaohua cotton arrived. The current situation of spot cotton transactions is listed below.

Foreign cotton prices: The New York cotton market was relatively active. It opened firm due to a positive Liverpool telegraphic report, and continued to rise due to purchases from domestic and overseas buyers. Spot trading remained slow, but because other commodities were rising in price, there was optimism about cotton prices, which improved sentiment. Yesterday, New York rose another four to five points, India surged by over two rupees, and Egypt also rose by over thirty points. Exchange rates were also tightening due to high demand, causing legal tender cotton prices to rise. US and Brazilian cotton rose by 40 cents per picul, Indian cotton surged by 80 cents, and Egyptian cotton rose by over one dollar. Due to the high overseas cotton prices, factories in Shanghai were taking a wait-and-see approach, and there were no transactions by domestic or foreign factories. The calculated factory prices for yesterday's cotton are listed below.

### Silk and Tea
### Foreign Silk Rises Again; Shanghai Silk Trading Remains Stagnant

Yesterday, the overseas silk market saw Yokohama spot open at ¥1,010 and close in the afternoon at ¥1,020. Deferred contracts were priced at ¥986, closing at ¥1,010, a surge of ¥25 from the previous day's close. New York silk prices also rose sharply, with 83-point Japanese silk priced at $2.23, up seven cents; 75-point Japanese silk rose three cents; and Shanghai silk rose seven cents, while Guangdong silk rose 15 cents, reaching the highest point. In Lyon, prices rose steadily, with Chinese and Japanese raw silk rising by one to two francs.

The local market: The pre-sale electric cables were bought by foreign firms. Transactions remained stagnant. The price for Qian'ou silk rose from ¥420 to ¥470 yesterday. Silk cocoon prices are soaring. User transactions are firm. Demand for Yinzhuang white silk remained strong. Yesterday, Samsung and other firms purchased a total of 40 bales of thrown silk, with prices gradually rising.

### Piece Goods
### Floating Account Holders Eager to Sell; Actual Sales Still Active; Dyeing Factories Buying Eastern Cloth

Due to the undeveloped sales from various regions, the situation for domestic cloth remained weak. Floating account holders were eager to sell, and the market was disorganized. However, factory prices remained firm, with daily shipments, which strengthened confidence among traders. In the morning, various prices were still trending downward, but Eastern cloth rebounded after falling in the afternoon, and prices stabilized again. Actual sales were more active in the Shantou and Quanzhou regions, with over 200 pieces of colored striped pongee, broadcloth, dyed cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill being purchased. The Sichuan region purchased a smaller amount of bleached cloth, colored twill, standard cloth, and printed cloth, totaling about one thousand pieces of white cloth. Shipments from the Zhejiang eastern region of Wenzhou and Ningbo were also increasing daily. Wholesale shops in the market were gradually becoming more active, and small-scale wholesale business in areas such as northern Jiangsu and along the railway lines of Changzhou and Wuxi were becoming more apparent. Local wholesale clothing merchants traded over two thousand pieces of plain silk pongee and new striped shirt pongee.

Eastern white cloth fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon, improving market sentiment. In the morning, the market situation was due to the month-end loan payments of fellow traders, and continued to cut down on price. Fine cloth fell by another five to one cents per piece, which then was taken up by local dyeing factories and Tianjin traders. When Dongmian Yanghang of Japanese was interested to buy three to four hundreds bales, the market was even more energetic and current supply was limited. The selling price of the fine cloth compared to the previous day rose one to one and a half cents for each piece. The trading amount for fine twill rose five cents for each piece. The market trading of our local dyeing factories and companies were around 1000 pieces, where traders from Tianjin bought around 300 bales of fine cloth.

Piece goods exports: Today, 200 pieces were shipped to Tianjin, 110 pieces to Yantai, 240 pieces to Shantou, 40 pieces to Hong Kong, 220 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 6 pieces to Siam.

### Miscellaneous Grains
### Bran Shipped to the East in Two Months; Over 120,000 Bags; Market Still Being Monopolized; No Individual Bags Opened Yesterday

Since the bran market was monopolized by a certain party, the market supply has been exhausted. No individual bags were opened yesterday. The entire market is now controlled, and no transactions can be made. According to general predictions, there will likely be significant changes in the near future. It is heard that over the past two months, over 120,000 bags of bran have been shipped to a certain region. This does not include goods that have been contracted for.

Today's bean exports include 190 bags to Shantou, 2,250 bags to Hong Kong, and 300 bags of raw peanuts also to Hong Kong.

### Hardware
### Limited Actual Sales of Lead and Tin; Market Shows Little Progress

The lead and tin market has been relatively firm recently, but actual sales have been stagnant, with only a small amount of activity from factories in the area. The situation is described in detail below.

Pig Lead: The types of pig lead currently circulating in the market are divided into three categories: foreign lead, domestic lead, and mixed lead. Foreign lead is mainly sold to tea traders, paint companies, printing houses, and lead oxide factories. However, since the outbreak of the war, most of the tea-producing areas have been occupied, resulting in a significant decrease in actual sales. Since other sales have not developed, the market has been sluggish. Consequently, only a little more than one hundred piculs have been traded daily. The price for old piculs is around forty yuan. Domestic lead is a specialty product of Hunan. Due to its low cost, sales are quite extensive. However, due to recent transportation difficulties, the cost has increased, and the market price for old piculs is thirty-eight yuan. Transactions are more common with lead oxide factories and paint companies, and there is also considerable demand from shipyards and type foundries. It is estimated that over two hundred piculs were sold yesterday, mostly from hardware stores in the French Concession. The price for mixed lead is around twenty-six yuan per picul, but the quality is poor, resulting in limited sales. The primary buyers are type foundries, with occasional purchases from shipyards. There are few other sales.

Block Tin: Block tin has been traded mostly from Shaoxing. This is due to the local production and sales of foil in China. Traffic interruptions from the war have depressed the block tin market. Therefore, little Yaoxi tin is being bought at high prices. The local market price in Shanghai is firm at ¥370 per picul. The actual trades were around fifty to sixty piculs, with most coming from individual buyers. However, the business volume in the market for tin is small and in poor shape. The trades are between shipyards and machine shops. Tianjin has the sales volume with other companies. The sales from river tin from Jianghua, Hengdi, Dou and Fuzu tin show no trades at all and the tin markets remain quiet. The quoted prices remain very stable.

### Sugar Market
### Diaoqing Expected to Arrive Today

Yesterday's sugar market was assessed by the association. Second and Fourth Grade Dutch coarse white sugar was still priced at the original level. Transshipment goods were transacted at ¥16.25. Dutch red sugar also remained unchanged. Taikoo brand refined white sugar from the western godown was ¥24.5, and from the eastern godown was ¥24.33. According to industry insiders, foreign exchange will likely tighten in the future, causing foreign sugar prices to rise, which is highly probable. It is heard that Shantou prices for domestic sugar have eased slightly, resulting in fewer transactions between firms. Only dozens of bags of ordinary Huanggang green sugar were traded by Shantou traders at ¥15.4. Hong Kong traders traded 314 pieces of Shimen sliced green sugar at prices ranging from ¥12.55 to ¥12.5. Jian traders traded 95 bags of Tongan green sugar at ¥14.8. Diaoqing sugar is expected to arrive today on the Jinan ship, and more is expected to arrive, resulting in a looser price quote. Yesterday, 290 bags of sugar arrived from Shantou.

### Seafood
### Shark Fins and Dried Squid Recently Offered for Sale

Various grades of shark fins, such as Ersan Sha and Pi Dao, were out of stock last winter. The latest shipments were offered for sale yesterday, and the market is stable. Tongbai is priced at ¥600, Ersha at ¥500, Sansha at ¥400, Sisha at ¥300, Pi Dao at ¥280, Shangqing at ¥400, Dui Chi at ¥580, and Jiwei at ¥60. Dried squid was also sold at prices ranging from ¥160 to ¥165, and Ti Pian was sold at prices ranging from ¥180 to ¥190.

### Small Inventions, Big Fortunes

— Lu Yi

We don't expect everyone to become an Edison, but we do hope that more people will engage in small inventions for daily necessities, which are equally beneficial to society and the economy. If readers don't believe me, let me tell you a few stories.

An American named Elias Howe came up with a clever sewing method. He put the eye of the sewing needle at the tip instead of the back, which led to the success of the so-called Singer sewing machine invented by another American, Mr. Singer. Mr. Howe himself earned over a million US dollars, and Mr. Singer's annual income reached three million dollars. A slight modification can have such a significant impact!

It is inconvenient to write with a pencil without an eraser at hand. In 1858, a person named Lipman invented the rubber-tipped pencil, which became popular everywhere. He obtained patent rights worth tens of thousands of dollars, and pencil manufacturers profited even more.

There are countless other small inventions such as safety pins, clothing snaps, soda bottle caps, and letter fasteners. Inventors and manufacturers alike have made great fortunes.

Anyone with inventive talent, as long as they target items that the public needs and everyone can afford, will surely become wealthy by engaging in the invention business.

### Refining Tungsten

— Xin Jun

China ranks first in the world in the production of tungsten. There are many mines in provinces such as Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Guizhou. The country's output accounts for 37% of the world's total, which is a major resource for our country. Tungsten is very similar to tin, so it is not easy to distinguish. It was not until 1781 that Scheele was able to identify it as a metal. Two years later, someone separated the tungsten. Since then, it has been used as a hard alloy, but it has never been used alone. In 1905, tungsten was mixed with paste and extruded from molds to make the best filaments for light bulbs. However, tungsten filaments are very brittle, so they are difficult to manufacture and inconvenient to use. Dr. Coolidge of the American General Electric Company spent many years developing a method to make tungsten ductile (flexible). Initially, general metallurgy experts thought this was impossible. Because the usual way to make metals ductile is to heat the metal above the recrystallization point and then cool it to normal temperature, but applying this method to tungsten has virtually no effect. Finally, the only method to refine tungsten and make it flexible was found. This method is to crush the fine grains of tungsten metal and beat them into striated strips. It softens when cold. Then, it is heated, but not to the recrystallization point, and then carefully hammered. After cooling, it is heated and hammered again, each time at a lower temperature than the previous one. This process of reheating and cooling, and continued hammering, is continued until normal temperature. If the same method were used on other metals, it would not only not become ductile, but would become brittle instead.

There is only one way to do it, and you have to follow each step exactly. By pulling out the fine grains of metal, the tungsten becomes ductile. If you are slightly careless, you will fail completely, and the tungsten will shatter into powder when it gets cold.

After years of hard work and research, a satisfactory result was achieved. The resulting tungsten filament has incredible tensile strength: a thickness of one-thousandth of an inch can withstand a force of 600,000 pounds per square inch. This tungsten filament is so flexible that it can be wound into various shapes without breaking. As the saying goes: "A hundred times refined steel turns to gentle fingers," now it can be said that "a hundred times refined tungsten turns to gentle fingers."

The method of extracting tungsten from tungsten ore is relatively simple. It involves extracting tungsten trioxide, also known as tungstic acid, from the ore and then reducing the tungsten trioxide with carbon to obtain impure powdered tungsten. This powder must be pressed into strips using large hydraulic power, as it cannot be melted by heat. This is because tungsten has a melting point of 3370 degrees, which is higher than any other metal, while platinum is only 1755 degrees. Turning the strips into filaments involves many steps and is very complex.

With tungsten filaments, the efficiency of light bulbs has doubled, and the light emitted is brighter and whiter than any previously used bulb. After making the phonograph needle out of tungsten steel, the efficiency has increased more than fifty times compared to previously used needles. Various other items, such as targets in X-ray tubes and ignition contacts in automobiles, have been improved with tungsten.

Tungsten has two names in Western languages: Wolfram and Tungsten.

### Saccharin

— Yu Shang

Saccharin was discovered by chance. Originally, a chemist was experimenting with a certain preservative and did not wash his hands before eating something. He found that what he was eating was very sweet, and thus discovered saccharin. Saccharin is not the essence extracted from sugar, so it would be more appropriate to call it sweet essence.

Although saccharin is much sweeter than sugar, it has no nutritional value.

It is estimated that saccharin is five hundred times sweeter than sugar, but it is not the sweetest thing in the world. A certain compound (Oxime) made from a certain oil in Asia is two thousand times sweeter than sugar, making it four times sweeter than saccharin.

In addition to being extremely sweet, saccharin has a significant disinfecting effect.

Strangely, saccharin does not attract sugar-loving insects such as ants and flies, but these small insects will not easily miss an opportunity if they encounter a small amount of sugar.

### Planetarium

— Ye Ren

European and American countries have spared no effort in promoting scientific knowledge. The planetarium is a facility for spreading astronomical knowledge. The two planetariums in the Munich Museum in Germany and the New York Museum of Natural History in the United States are the most famous in the world. There is also a planetarium in the New York World's Fair this April. The exterior is spherical, as shown in the picture, and is supported by three buttresses. The interior is also a spherical space, one hundred feet in diameter, representing the universe. A twenty-foot diameter sphere is suspended in the center, representing the Earth moving in the starlight. There are two spiral staircases between the inner and outer walls of the spherical room, allowing visitors to observe the different positions of the Earth in the air at various parts.

The planetarium is equipped with an extremely complex and wonderful celestial projector. It looks like a giant dumbbell. The two ends of the sphere are equipped with many projection lenses. When projected onto the hemispherical roof, the starry sky at night appears, with fixed stars, planets, the moon, and the sun. At the bottom of the dome-shaped star roof, lights are used to render the horizon line.

The projector rotates freely, so it can project all celestial phenomena, such as sunrise and sunset in different seasons, the sun's orbit in the sky, and how it moves north in summer and south in winter. In addition, phenomena such as the phases of the moon and the entire movement of the planets can be performed on the roof. The speed of the performance is proportional to the speed of the planets' movement, but the entire movement can be completed in a few minutes. The planetarium can not only perform the daily movements of the planets, but also display the position of the planets and moon at any time in the past or future.

The planetarium at the New York World's Fair has its hemispherical roof cut open to show the contents.

### Water Mist Fire Extinguisher

— Xi Wu

Fire is a terrible danger in aircraft hangars. Each aircraft's fuel tank often contains a large amount of gasoline, so a fire in one aircraft can often cause other aircraft to explode one by one, resulting in huge losses of material and lives.

Fires in aircraft hangars cannot be extinguished with water, and chemical fire extinguishers are not always effective. G. Griswold, the fire chief of Los Angeles, the center of the US aircraft industry, invented a method of extinguishing fires with "water mist" to cope with this serious situation. Numerous tests have proven it to be very effective.

The principle of this fire extinguishing method is very simple. Readers probably know that dispersing grains of wheat on a fire will cause them to burn faster than a pile of wheat. If flour is sprayed into a fire from a pipe, an explosion can occur, which is rapid combustion.

Similarly, shooting a stream of water into a fire only has a small extinguishing effect. Although this water can cool the surface of the burning material and reduce the production of flammable vapor, the speed is too slow.

Griswold's basic principle is to appropriately shoot two streams of water from the pipe so that they collide with each other, creating a very fine water mist. The heat absorption area of this mist is much larger than that of a solid stream of water, so it immediately turns into water vapor. The latent heat of vaporization of water—the amount of heat absorbed to turn water into steam—is very large, so when water vapor is produced, it can quickly absorb heat. On the other hand, the density of flammable vapor increases due to rapid heat loss, and the oxygen that helps combustion is displaced by the downward water mist, so the mixture of air and flammable vapor becomes too thin, and combustion stops.

Of course, it is very effective to shoot water on burning wood to extinguish the fire, but if you shoot it on burning gasoline, it will stir up the gasoline, resulting in the fire spreading even faster. However, when water is made into a mist or steam and impinged on gasoline, the combustion stops very quickly, even though gasoline has a very low flash point. Because this fire extinguishing method uses very little water and the extinguishing speed is very fast, the resulting material loss is of course reduced.

Shooting water on burning gasoline has little or no fire extinguishing effect.

Shooting water made into a mist on burning gasoline with a special nozzle immediately stops the combustion.

### World Science News

Sex Can Be Determined by Humans

Dr. William O. Puckett of the United States recently demonstrated his artificial sex determination method at the American Society of Zoologists. By injecting various endocrine secretions into tadpoles of a certain frog species, he can arbitrarily make them female or male.

According to Dr. Puckett, his method has been repeatedly proven effective for this frog species. He provided microscopic specimens of the gonads of very young tadpoles for examination, indicating that the sex of tadpoles is not yet determined at this stage. Their sex differentiation usually occurs at the end of the tadpole stage. The ordinary ratio of female to male is fifty to fifty.

Near the brain of these frogs is a small organ, a mucous gland. If mucus from tadpoles is extracted and injected into early-stage tadpoles, their gonads mature faster, but the female-to-male ratio remains one to one. However, if female endocrine or male endocrine is injected together with the mucus, the tadpoles receiving female endocrine become female, and those receiving male endocrine become male.

If his method can be extended and applied to humans, then having sons or daughters could be according to the wishes of the parents, and some social problems could be invisibly reduced. Although this goal has not yet been achieved, its path has indeed shown a glimmer of hope.

Automatic Distress Signal

The California Institute of Technology in the United States has invented an automatic radio distress signal that, when an aircraft is forced to land, can continuously send out short-wave SOS signals for four days, even if the aircraft is destroyed. This signal machine is a battery-powered radio transmitter protected by fireproof material, suspended from the tail of the aircraft by a helical spring because the tail suffers the least damage during a violent landing. When the signal machine receives continuous shocks, it emits a distress call, allowing any search aircraft to fly directly to the accident site for rescue.

Automatic Parachute

Two Soviet engineers, the Doronin brothers, recently announced in Moscow their invention of an automatic parachute opener. This mechanism is like a table alarm clock, which can automatically open the parachute from five to one hundred and eighty seconds after the parachutist leaves the aircraft, but it does not prevent the parachutist from opening the parachute manually. This invention is of great benefit to training aviation scientists and sending injured personnel from aircraft.

Sunspots and Wireless Radio

Australia is currently cooperating with the British Post Office to conduct experiments to study the effect of sunspots on radio waves. According to astronomical predictions, the activity of sunspots will be extremely strong next year. British and Australian experts are building special radio receiving stations, placing several antennas directly facing the direction of incoming radio waves. The purpose is to accurately measure the angle formed by radio waves and the ground.

### Introducing Two Major Science Publications

— A Reader

Long-Standing Scientific Monthly

Popular Scientific Pictorial

In recent years, the government and people of our country have exerted considerable effort in promoting and paying attention to science. In this era of intense competition in the 20th century, only by following the path of science can we build the country and enrich the lives of the people. If science cannot develop, not only will we be unable to conquer nature and utilize abundant resources, but we will also become captives of nature and be subjected to the domination of others. Each of us should deeply believe that only by revitalizing science and enhancing scientific research and interest can we catch up with this era of tumultuous tides.

After the outbreak of the war, publications disseminating scientific knowledge have greatly decreased. However, school teachers and students, working men and women, and families, if they have even a slight interest in science, easily feel difficulties, especially young people in the process of learning, who should make beneficial books and newspapers their good friends during their spare time. Scientific knowledge is constantly changing and is indispensable to everyone's daily life. Now, I would like to introduce two scientific publications that have not been affected by the war but have become more brilliant to the public, which may provide considerable supplementation and satisfaction in the reader's spiritual food.

Science

Published by the Science Society of China, one issue per month, annual subscription price is three yuan, halved during the national crisis. This monthly magazine has been published for more than twenty years and is of a semi-professional nature. The editors and writers are all domestic scientific authorities, focusing on discussing novel scientific topics, introducing domestic and foreign scientific trends, and describing the progress and news of various disciplines. It is a must-read periodical for science teachers and high school students and above. After the war, the magazine became more innovative, still adhering to its past spirit and moving forward on the front lines of the domestic scientific community. It will represent our country's scientific publications, keeping pace with the two major scientific publications, Nature in the UK and Science in the US, to promote the light of science in our country.

The publication recently reduced the economic burden on readers, and it is said that there are preferential measures, which is truly a rare opportunity.

Scientific Pictorial

Edited by the Science Society of China, published by the China Science Company, one issue per month, two corners per issue.

This publication is a sister publication to the above-mentioned Science, but its purpose is to disseminate popular scientific knowledge and make the lives of the masses more scientific. The materials used are all based on the tastes and needs of the general public, and for the sake of easy understanding by readers, it adopts a style that emphasizes both pictures and text, with fluent and simple text and exquisite and novel illustrations, so it has been deeply welcomed by the public for several years. After the war, it did not change its old appearance, and once published a wartime special edition, which was praised by the majority of people.

This kind of pictorial with high value should be invested in every family and school garden.

The reader is interested and dares to introduce it.

### Changed

Bridge Guest

This is not an old-fashioned village schoolteacher saying that people's hearts have changed greatly—but people's hearts are indeed changing, not only people's hearts, but everything in the world is changing, whether it is the slow change lectured by some scholars or the "sudden change" that some politicians deeply hate. In short, without change, it cannot be called the world, or, without change, it cannot be called a living world. However, what we usually observe often only sees the two ends, the beginning when it has not changed, and the end when it has already changed. As for the intermediate process, either we cannot observe it because it comes and goes too quickly, or we cannot observe it due to some circumstances. So, when we encounter the appearance of the end, we exclaim "It's changed!" and it's over.

In this short conversation, no great magic can be changed. Let's take one of the pressing problems, the problem of eating, to chat about, and you can see one aspect of the changing nature of the living world. Suppose you go to a restaurant every day, what do you eat? Beef, mutton, chicken, and duck. What kind of meat grows on you? Human meat. Strange, it's changed! If it doesn't change, sin, sin, then it hasn't entered reincarnation and has already fallen into the animal realm. But why does it change, how does it change, the beginning is beef and mutton, etc., the end is human meat, what is the intermediate process? Please use an analogy: a big tree is the beginning, a desk is the end, we can observe the intermediate process, we can observe it. Saws, axes, chisels, and ropes are tools, and the limbs of craftsmen are abilities. The use of abilities and tools turns a big tree into several wooden blocks of different sizes. This change from big to small is the first part of the process, called destruction. Then, several wooden blocks are combined to form the entire desk. This change from small to big is the second part of the process, called construction. Leaving some broken wood scraps is the economic loss that should be there from changing back and forth. May I ask, is the intermediate process of beef and mutton turning into human meat similar to this situation? Very similar. Our axes and saws are called enzymes, our craftsmen are called glands, and the wooden blocks of different sizes each have their names, such as amino acids, glucose, soap, or glycerin. Of course, some broken wood scraps are inevitable. Because of this change back and forth—destruction and construction—we don't suddenly change into beef, mutton, chicken, and duck.

Extending our vision a little bit, we can't help but exclaim "The use of change is great!" May I ask, can you eat straw as rice? Can you eat grass as vegetables? No, no. You wronged me, you have eaten it. Of course, not directly. Cattle and sheep eat grass and grow beef and mutton (according to the above-mentioned method of change), and you eat beef and mutton again, which is actually indirectly eating grass. We use indirect methods to increase countless food supplies out of thin air. This is an important issue in food economics, and it is not convenient to discuss it in depth here. Try to extend your vision a little bit further, then it will be bad enough, and it is difficult to guarantee that you will not suddenly change into cattle and sheep. Don't get angry, this is something you have not seen yourself; perhaps, as the jade seller said, after the corpse turns into flying dust, use some people's tears to flush it into the wilderness, and then cultivate wild grass, and then cattle and sheep will come to eat it, and then you have to change again. Changing back and forth like this can be called reincarnation. It is said that among the ten halls of Yama, there is one called the Wheel-Turning King, is it true? At this point, we should not extend our vision further, lest the ox-headed horse-faced men all run out to embellish science. Then, the magic show is over.

### Answering Facts with Facts

— Mao Lie

Since Chamberlain's international policy advocated accommodating facts, for a time, justice and humanity were almost unable to raise their heads. Due to the poisonous saliva of this policy, in Europe, Austria was sacrificed, Czechoslovakia was destroyed, and now it has affected Spain. The recognition of the Nationalist government by Britain and France as legitimate is the first step to plunging Spain into the abyss.

The recognition of the Nationalist government by Britain and France is, of course, reasonable. However, in summary, it is nothing more than the Nationalist army has won the victory, believing that it is inevitable in fact. Democracy advocates around the world want to run around and shout to stop this move, of course, it is ineffective, and the appeals and protests of the Spanish Republican government are, of course, even more ineffective. Fortunately, human hearts are not dead, and in various countries around the world and the Republican government, they have not succumbed to this, but answered the facts with facts.

Although the Spanish president resigned, the prime minister and commander-in-chief still continue their resistance. This is a fact. Democracy advocates in various countries are still the backing of the Spanish Republican government and continue to provide assistance with strength. This is also a fact. Therefore, the British and French government authorities do not have any love for Franco, let alone any love for Fascist ideas. As long as the Republican government and democracy advocates in various countries work harder to expand the scope of these two facts and increase their effectiveness, then Chamberlain and Daladier's so-called facts will shrink or disappear invisibly, making them unable to recognize these later facts and suddenly change their plans.

Therefore, I believe that the only way to deal with any fierce, barbaric, and unjust and inhumane facts is to show serious, unyielding facts that are based on justice and humanity in every way. This is better than thousands of words of negotiation—which is simply begging—and negotiations, and the three-repeated and four-reversed ultimatums and official articles, I don't know how many times.

We still remember: At first, didn't Germany and Italy, as well as a certain democratic country that was willing to help us, persuade us to succumb to the facts created by force, which made us unbearable? Even now, doesn't it try to persuade us to be such a submissive country? But we have answered them with our facts, that is, to resist to the end before victory. This fact, in the past, eliminated their persuasion; now, it has also greatly increased their trust in us: That is, needless to say, in the future, they will certainly fully recognize the facts we have created.

Let's work hard to create our facts!

### Interrogation

— Wall Grass

We were押解d to the police station.

This is an old-fashioned but unusually clean house with two large courtyards in the front and back. The living room in the middle is very large, at least capable of accommodating about two hundred people. In the past, the town's gentry used to hold meetings here. Since the National Army withdrew to the west, it has fallen into the hands of the enemy's demons, and is occupied by pseudo-police who are our compatriots but willingly sell their conscience, as an office.

Taken into a厢房 on the left.

The room was lit early. A scribe-like pseudo-police officer was dozing off listlessly. Peanuts and wine glasses were scattered on the table. Hearing these many chaotic footsteps, he woke up in surprise. Seeing the eight-character mustache Inspector Jia standing in front of him, he couldn't help but make a salute in a flustered manner, constantly flattering:

"Inspector Jia, you've worked hard, you've worked hard!" He looked at us again, "Just these three?"

The officer nodded and gave him a few more instructions, then went to his bedroom to rest alone. The remaining pseudo-police officers also left one after another to change their wet uniforms.

The three of us were really exhausted, very cold, and our teeth were chattering. I摸 from my underwear pocket the cigarette case, fortunately it wasn't too wet and I could smoke it; I gave each of my two partners one, and they accepted it without hesitation. However, the box of matches next to me was lost on the way, so I had to ask the scribe-like pseudo-police officer:

"Can I have a light?"

"Hmm," he showed a hesitant look.

I immediately cleverly handed him one, which made him happy, and he quickly lit our cigarettes. After a while, he smoked his own cigarette.

We felt a little warmer.

At this time, the scribe-like pseudo-police officer was very attentive. He poured three cups of tea and kept comforting us:

"I think it won't be a big deal. If you're lucky, you can go out tonight. We are all Chinese, aren't we?"

My two partners started talking to him again, and the rice shop apprentice was the one who said the most. He tried his best to please him.

I didn't say much, and I was very anxious to urinate. Just then, another pseudo-police officer ran in in a hurry. He said that the bureau chief wanted to提 us for interrogation. I was the first to be called. I couldn't bear it any longer, so I said what I meant. He told me to follow him silently, led me to the toilet, and I排洩d with satisfaction. Afterwards, I was immediately taken to interrogation.

The pseudo-bureau chief was still young, with a very white complexion, and no evil spirit at all. He politely told me to sit down. Inspector Jia, who had just arrested me, was also there, still with a solemn attitude, but with a slightly tired expression.

The bureau chief and I started answering questions:

"What's your surname?"

"Zheng."

"What's your name?"

"Jiasheng." I gave him some more information, "The 'jia' of country, the 'sheng' of sound."

"Where do you live?"

"No. 2 Zhengjiazhai."

"Hmm, what do you do?"

"I don't do anything."

"What about before?"

"A teacher." I hesitated slightly.

"Where?"

"Hangzhou." I told a lie.

"Have you ever committed a crime before?"

"Never!"

"But someone reported that you are a Communist?"

"I don't understand what you're saying."

"Said you disrupted public order!"

"Where's the evidence?"

He stopped talking, paused, and leaned closer to me and said:

"I hope what you say is true."

"As you hope."

The eight-character mustache traitor插话d:

"You probably don't understand, do you? The bureau chief means, if you are really a good person, then of course everything can be understood, but since someone is framing you, living in this area may not be safe, so it's better to leave as soon as possible." After speaking, he explored my expression.

I顺口湊 added a sentence:

"I originally wanted to go to Weixin College to study."

"Do you really want to go?"

"Yes."

I was no longer a criminal, but seemed to have a very deep friendship with them.

Then, my two partners were also brought in to应应应故事.

It was still raining outside. The three of us were accompanied by two pseudo-police officers and escorted out. We couldn't find a car for a while, so we had to walk in the rain.

All the way, I secretly smiled, I played a comedy myself.

### Only Questions, Only Admiration

### Hu Quan's Pro-War Argument

— Jie

——Reading History Notes——

History is often an excellent lesson for reality. The mistakes made by the ancients are clearly shown in history to future generations, enabling them to avoid repeating the same mistakes. This is like a ship that hits a reef and sinks. This reef should have a sign to warn later ships.

During the Song Dynasty, the Jin people invaded, and Emperors Huizong and Qinzong were taken away; north and south of the Yellow River were successively occupied. Then Emperor Gaozong of Song crossed south to Lin'an and established a small court in a corner. At this time, the national crisis had indeed reached its extreme. But at that time, there were virtuous prime ministers such as Li Gang and Zhao Ding internally, and famous generals such as Zhang Jun, Zong Ze, Yue Fei, and Han Shizhong externally: and the righteous soldiers and heroes of both rivers, under the control of Zong Ze, resisted the Jin, with a crowd of millions. At this time, as long as Emperor Gaozong of Song made a pro-war decision, it would not be difficult to recover the lost land! But unfortunately, Gaozong was昏庸懦弱, and listened to the妄言 of a group of pro-peace factions such as Wang Boyan, Huang Qianshan, and Qin Gui, and actually accepted the humiliating conditions and negotiated peace with the Jin people. Then the virtuous prime minister was driven away, the good general was murdered, and the millions of heroes of the two rivers were discouraged when they heard it, and they also dispersed.

While Qin Gui was in charge of the peace talks, Hu Quan, the editor of the Privy Council, strongly advocated resistance. In his memorial, he was激昂沉痛. Not only did he explain the advantages and disadvantages of war and peace, but he also boldly advocated beheading the pro-peace faction to show his determination never to humiliate and negotiate peace. The chief culprits of the pro-peace faction in his eyes were Qin Gui, Sun Jin, and Wang Lun. He said in his memorial: "I am willing to cut off the heads of the three people, put them on poles in the streets, and then detain the envoy of the captive, and blame him for rudeness. Then I will raise the teacher of questioning the crime, and the teacher of the three armies will double his spirit without fighting. Otherwise, I will go to the East Sea and die! How can I live in a small court?" After the memorial was presented, Qin Gui still suspected that he was mentally ill. How could I have such bold and狂言? Qin Gui demoted him to Guangzhou. Wu Shigu of Yixing刻d Hu Quan's "Pro-War Argument" on wood. The Jin people offered thousands of gold to recruit him. It can be seen that the enemy also worships the upright and loyal officials of the Song Dynasty.

Later, when Emperor Xiaozong of Song succeeded to the throne, Hu Quan again presented a second memorial, which again rejected peace talks and requested troops to resist the war. He analyzed the psychology of the pro-peace faction at that time in great detail. He believed that there were three types of people who advocated peace: one was "偷懦", who had no spirit of national rejuvenation, and only knew how to eat and fear death. The second was "苟安", who only knew how to temporarily seek a moment of ease and did not plan for the long-term interests of the country. The third was "附會", who followed the ministers' agreement that peace talks should be held in order to win the ministers' favor. The country was ruined by these three types of people! Unfortunately, Hu Quan's second memorial was not adopted. Emperor Gaozong of Song erred once before, and Emperor Xiaozong made another mistake later. As a result, the lost land could not be recovered, and the Song Dynasty was also in danger!

Learn from past mistakes. The lessons of history should be firmly remembered by everyone. We hope that everyone now will be Hu Quan who advocates war, and thoroughly eliminate all pro-peace concepts of stealing, cowardice, and conformity. Whoever dares to openly advocate peace talks should "cut off his head and stick it in the streets."

### Remote Blessing

— Liu You

In a深夜, I woke up from a good dream and suddenly remembered my close friend, a passionate young man.

He was not afraid of difficulties, overcame all kinds of obstacles, and abandoned everything without hesitation,奔向异地 alone to serve the motherland.

I admire him, I envy him, I regard him as a warrior who can overcome everything. So young, with perseverance and wisdom, undoubtedly, he has a promising future.

He is going to fulfill his responsibilities, not afraid of thousands of miles, separated from his dearest family, and even less afraid of辛劳艰苦. He must reach his goal. This is his noble and greatness.

I suddenly remembered that he was doing immortal things in a corner of the world. He probably wouldn't think of me because he didn't have time to think, and I was so small.

Me! I can't forget him. I remember him all the time. There are countless young people around me who are like him, but they can't reach him. He is an outstanding person.

I want to praise him, praise him, but this is not what he needs. I can only hide in a corner and遥祝 him to move forward smoothly and fight for the motherland. I also wish him more comrades, and everyone will work together to achieve "success"!

I遥祝 him, day and night,无输 at any time!

### What About Our Criticism?

By 品品 (Pin Pin)

A few days ago, I met an old friend who reviews films. Knowing his efforts in this area, I said, "You have the potential to be a film critic." He immediately retorted, "No, no, it's for a living." Indeed, nowadays, everyone is caught up in the pursuit of breadcrumbs, and in this scramble, good things are hardly seen: criticism is the same.

In newspapers or magazines, I rarely find good critical articles. What I see are just monotonous "cheerleading" or "applause": this is not Criticism but Reviewing. Of course, we don't want introductions; they're deceptive. What about our criticism?

Criticism—literary criticism, film criticism, book reviews, theater reviews, art reviews, etc.—is a branch of art. Strictly speaking, there was no such thing as criticism before Sainte-Beuve. Thus, criticism only emerged in the 19th century. Although its history is short, it has emerged as an independent field of study; therefore, to write a critique, one must have a certain level of competence. We all understand that good criticism, like good creation, has a positive force. But what constitutes good criticism?

Here, based on M. Murry's view, I will write down the criteria for good criticism:

First, express the effect and characteristics of the thing being criticized.

Second, trace the effect and characteristics, and describe their necessary expressions.

Third, establish the determinants of this emotional power (the author's background can be mentioned).

Fourth, examination of the work's formal techniques.

Fifth, a more detailed examination of a specific feature.

Finally, the most important point is that the critic should elevate themselves. Let's hear what Murry says: "The critic should realize that he is an artist. He should pay attention to the responsibility placed on his art; he should respect the technique of his work. He should not devalue himself, he should not be gullible, he should not be disloyal, whether praising or blaming, especially in modern times, he should not be disloyal in praise."

Murry's last point is extremely thorough. For the sake of living, a large number of critics become cheap, disregarding their own art or technique, and making disloyal praises and condemnations—which we call "cheerleading" and "booing." Such people are far from being critics. We need to rebuild criticism.

I also feel that one reason why China doesn't have good criticism is because there isn't enough space given to criticism. Literary supplements rarely have a criticism column, other supplements have limitations, and magazines are out of the question now. In such an environment, good criticism is naturally difficult to create. Criticism itself is an art, and it requires a certain amount of completeness.

If the above two conditions are met—not being cheap and not being constrained by space—how can the five standards set by Murry be achieved? I dare to offer a method: if the critic is an artist, then like an artist, he must have cultivation and foundation. Being a critic is not easy. Fleury said to A. France, "Sir, oratory, pure literature, philosophy, history, everything is in here, criticism is not included, it includes all of them. Yes, the critic takes turns being an orator, a philosopher, a historian." I hope critics don't neglect their silver chain for the sake of living.

Critics, you are powerful, but you must not devalue yourselves or resort to trickery.

Spring and Autumn

### Laughter

—佛 (Fo)

I recently saw an article in a certain newspaper titled "The Value of Laughter," which said that laughter is a precious gift that can improve personal health and happiness. This is naturally true, but there are different kinds of laughter, good laughter, bad laughter, bitter laughter, cold laughter, sinister laughter, flattering laughter, and many other varieties of laughter.

When I was young, I studied at a private school with a teacher. When I started learning to write essays, I would be at a loss for what to say, how to start writing, how to form an idea, how to choose words. My writing was incoherent, my sentences were incomplete, and the essay was rambling and difficult to understand. When I presented it to the teacher, he would pick up his brush, make a vertical mark, and then throw down the brush, laughing loudly and saying, "This is nonsense, not an essay." Then I understood that laughter is not always good; sometimes the taste of laughter is more unpleasant than scolding or beating.

During the Tang Dynasty, Yang Zaisi became a prime minister by specializing in flattery and ingratiation. Zhang Tongxiu, the Vice Minister of Rituals and the elder brother of Yi Zhi, once made a joke during a banquet, saying that Yang Zaisi's face resembled that of a Goryeo person. Such a sarcastic remark! Not only was Yang Zaisi not angry, but he was happy and cut paper to make a hat, wore his purple robe backwards, and performed a Goryeo dance. Thereupon, Zhang Tongxiu laughed heartily, Yang Zaisi laughed heartily, and everyone present laughed heartily. These "three laughs" clearly have three different meanings.

During the Song Dynasty, Han Tuozhou once toured the South Garden with many guests, passed a mountain villa, and looking at the bamboo fence and thatched cottage, said, "This is truly the atmosphere of the countryside, but it lacks the crowing of chickens and the barking of dogs." Suddenly, they heard a dog howling in the thickets. Looking closer, they found it was Shi Duo. Looking at the bamboo fence and thatched cottage, what does it have to do with Shi Duo, since there were no crowing chickens and barking dogs? But Shi Duo insisted on catering to Tuozhou's intentions, acting like a chicken and a dog, doing whatever it took. Tuozhou laughed heartily, Shi Duo also laughed heartily, and all the followers also laughed heartily. These two types of laughter are the same, but the meanings of the laughter are very different.

According to a report from the United Press Tokyo, the "Manchukuo" Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Zhang Jinghui signed the protocol for joining the Anti-Comintern Pact in Changchun. Representatives from Germany, Italy, and Japan also signed the agreement. In reality, the so-called "Manchukuo" Prime Minister and Foreign Minister was completely a puppet, yet he was present and signed the document. After the signing, the German and Italian representatives laughed heartily, the Japanese representatives must have also laughed heartily, and Mr. Zhang Jinghui also laughed heartily. Therefore, although laughter is the same, the meaning of laughter can be multiple.

Among the several types of laughter, flattering laughter is the most useful, bringing both good health and good fortune. "Those who are good at being humorous should do it themselves, for laughter is the magic formula for getting promoted and making a fortune."

### Saving Others Is Saving Yourself

—谷風 (Gu Feng)

"Saving others is saving yourself, rescuing those in disaster is saving the nation."

A few days ago, I saw this slogan on the stage of a charity performance for refugee relief organized by the Guangdong Association in Shanghai. Although the image of the play performed that day has gradually faded and blurred, this slogan is still vividly emerging before my eyes.

Speaking of which, this slogan is not particularly new. In the past, whenever there were natural disasters or man-made calamities, it was always used, and as a result, these words have long become clichés. But within them lies an undeniable truth.

For example, taking Tao Qian, who evaded reality and looked for his so-called "Shangri-La" the idyllic paradise, and uttered cool words such as "not knowing the Han, let alone the Wei and Jin dynasties," but in the end, this only left a big joke for himself in the legends. In fact, the Wei and Jin dynasties were still the Wei and Jin dynasties, and even Tao Qian himself did not dare to believe whether the "Shangri-La" existed.

The current era of great turmoil is certainly different from Tao Qian's era, but one thing is the same: some people still want to find a "Shangri-La" that is detached from reality, where there are no air raids, no airplanes and cannons, no cruel reality, and where there is always joy, comfort, wine, meat, and all other tools of enjoyment... Thus, the isolated Shanghai has become the "Shangri-La" in their minds. People flock to Shanghai in large numbers. How happy Shanghai is! There are no air raids, and no terrible bombs. There is fine wine, prostitutes...

As a result, Shanghai's population has exceeded five million, and the consumption in hotels, dance halls, bars, cinemas, foreign guide companies, Jai Alai courts, dog racing tracks, and other decadent places of amusement has increased tenfold.

But also in here, there are more than one hundred thousand starving refugees, who are panicked even with a life like pigs and dogs!

Wake up, individual hedonists, know that selfishly seeking enjoyment only pushes you into a deeper trap of pain. "Shangri-La" is just a vain fantasy. People can only survive by the close connection, mutual assistance, cooperation, and real struggle between people. Especially in today's critical moment for the survival of the Chinese nation, the connection, mutual assistance, cooperation, and struggle between people is even more necessary and should be strengthened.

What's more, those who are being rescued are compatriots who are suffering for their motherland!

"Saving others is saving yourself, rescuing those in disaster is saving the nation."

### Lantern Market

—思敬 (Si Jing)

Since the Lunar New Year, the bustle and prosperity of the ten-mile foreign concessions have been indescribable. Even before the tenth day of the Lunar New Year, the lantern market, which adorns the Lantern Festival, has stirred people's interest. Everywhere, old and young alike, there is a chorus of songs. Since Shanghai has been called an "isolated island," people seem to cherish festivals even more, perhaps with the intention of "enjoying the moment"?

I am a farmer's son, but now my hometown is occupied by the enemy. My hometown's elders, brothers, and childhood companions may now be refugees in foreign lands, wandering in unfamiliar places, or even become ghosts in the ditches. In the deserted fields, who will be carrying the lion lantern and playing with the embroidered ball all night long? The magnificent scene described as "around the fifteenth day of the Lunar New Year, women make straw figures with paper faces, wearing complete headscarves, shirts, and skirts, called 'maidens,' supported by two girls, worshiped with horse manure, drumming, singing the 'Horse Manure Xiang Song,' and everyone prays for good or bad luck" can only be found in dreams!

Farmers work hard all year round, from spring plowing to summer weeding, autumn harvest to winter storage, without leisure. Only in the first month of the new year can everyone catch their breath, sit in small tea houses, or visit relatives and friends. If last year was a bumper year, then the new year is even more meaningful, because every family's back room is piled high with mountains of rice, and there is extra money in their pockets to make a new robe, enjoy a feast of wine and meat, or even push a small domino game. But in their simple minds, they never forget the "gods" who bestowed the bumper harvest. Therefore, the Lantern Festival has been passed down through the generations. On the one hand, it is to celebrate good fortune, to revel and make merry before the start of another year of farming, to compensate for the hard work and physical exertion of the whole year. On the other hand, it is naturally to repay the "gods" for their bestowal, hoping for continued bumper harvests this year. Relying on the crops they have earned through their own labor, they put it in the "gods'" account, which is perhaps not so much the farmers' stupidity as it is the lack of universal Chinese education. But their simplicity and hard work should allow them an opportunity to enjoy themselves as much as possible, which is not to be blamed. According to my memory, after the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, several village elders would plan the Lantern Festival. They would go to each household to solicit donations, no matter how much, and any expenses beyond what was collected would be borne by the organizers. But those who solicited donations were very enthusiastic and willing to contribute as much as they could. On the morning of the fifteenth day, everything was prepared, and the whole village ate meat and drank wine in the square, and so did the women. The lanterns were all made by themselves, and the most elaborate was naturally a dragon lantern, up to several tens of feet long. Those who danced the lantern were trained. When night fell, the whole village was brightly lit, and when the sound of gongs and drums rose, the long dragon would emerge from the Earth God Temple, baring its teeth and brandishing its claws, flying up and down in the square, performing various amazing dance poses.

Once the Lantern Festival was over, the village would return to its usual tranquility. Men would plow and women would weave, and everyone would work hard.

As for the lantern market in the city, I have never seen it. How the customs vary from place to place, I naturally do not know. Ah Ying's "Novel Idle Talk" has this passage: "The lantern market in the northern capital starts on the eighth day of the Lunar New Year, peaks on the thirteenth, and ends on the seventeenth. During this time, from morning to night it is a 'market,' and from dusk to dawn it is a 'lantern.' The market area is in Donghuamen, two miles east. In the market, there are merchants from all over, rare and exotic treasures from China and abroad, antiques from the Three Dynasties and Eight Dynasties, and objects used by people from all walks of life. There are three rows of streets and four columns of markets, called opening the market with nine markets. The market is crowded with people, and even cars cannot turn around. The market buildings mostly face north and south, and at night, every house is crowded with people watching the lanterns. Among them, especially those with banners hanging in front of the door, must be the relatives of powerful families, aristocratic families, official families, and wealthy families." One can imagine the magnificent scene of "ten thousand coins for half a day and night," "each family's relatives and each family's sons, mutually hiding and looking at each other through the sparse curtains."

How is the lantern market in the southern city, and to what extent has it changed later, is still unknown. However, we can know that the lantern market in the city is purely for joy and boasting, that is without doubt.

Feng Qi's "Watching Lanterns" says: "Brocade gauze pipes are as embroidered as spring, but poor eaves and huts are as cold as before. Whose household is quiet and smokeless in the morning, and whose night is as bright as possible? Every night the capital looks new at the moon, and every year the states and countries report disasters frequently." It is still very accurate to use it to present the Lantern Festival in the ten-mile foreign concessions today. In paper drunk and money obsessed Shanghai, aren't there families with lanterns, families with no smoke, and families suffering from disasters?

Looking towards my hometown, my family is broken and scattered, and the fields are barren. The ten thousand refugees in the city are also starving. Do we have the leisure and the mood to hang up lanterns and set up markets, and make them see the lantern market without knowing where to find tears?

There will be such a year, there will be such a day, when we will return to our joyous days, and also days of boasting!

### More on Cigarette Cards

—李効鏞 (Li Xiaoyong)

Seeing Mr. Li Yukong's "Talking about Cigarette Cards over the Past Ten Years" in Spring and Autumn, I couldn't help but recall that I also spent a lot of energy, time, and money on this little thing when I was a child. Childhood passes quickly and cannot be recovered, and later there are very few opportunities to do such leisurely things. The reason why I also come to talk about cigarette cards today is not to claim to be an expert, but to reminisce about the joy of childhood.

Early cigarettes were mostly imported, so early cigarette cards were naturally attached to imported cigarette packs. Because of this, cigarettes were also called foreign cigarettes, and cigarette cards were also called "foreign cards."

Investigating its origin, because the initial cigarette paper packs were all made of soft paper, and a white card paper was added inside to make the paper pack stiffer, later a company accidentally thought of using this glossy card paper to print beautiful and pleasing pictures and advertisements, which actually aroused the interest of smokers and greatly increased sales. Therefore, various tobacco merchants competed to imitate, innovate, and spared no expense to hire specialized talents to design this picture, thus evolving into today's colorful cigarette cards.

The first imported cigarette cards were mostly Western beauties, with various photographic and color versions. One company specialized in producing various poses of beauties in front of mirrors, which people who liked to collect cards specially called "Beauty in the Mirror." Another company specialized in producing various poses of beauties under flowers and plants, and it was specially called "Beauty in the Grass." These two types of cards are now very valuable. Later, there were cards of famous city landscapes, cards of animals and plants, among which there were many very beautiful, and several flower cards were taken as patterns for fabrics by Chinese and foreign textile factories.

When Old Knife and Pin Hai cigarettes were sold in China, the appearance of foreign cigarette cards changed. The pictures and texts in the cards were all based on Chinese things and words, such as Three Hundred and Sixty Professions, which depicted the situations of small-scale businesses in our country (such as pot patching, blacksmithing, candy sellers, scissors sharpeners, all of which were available). There was also a Chinese idiom, with a picture of the idiom on the front (such as asking a blind man for directions, not being afraid of big eaters if you have money to open a restaurant, running away from the monk but not the temple), and one or two sentences written on the back (such as "those who are near to vermilion get stained red, those who are near to ink get stained black; the sound of wind, the sound of rain, the sound of reading, every sound enters the ear, family affairs, national affairs, world affairs, every affair is concerned," etc.). Others also featured famous generals of past dynasties (such as Guan Zhuangmu, Yue Wumu, etc., but not as good as the one later produced by Nanyang Tobacco Company, which had explanations on the back).

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

—包天笑 (Bao Tianxiao)

Chapter 5: Spring Comes to Bilo, Fragrance Floats on the Snow Sea, Flowers Fly from Tiger Hill, Moon Full in Li Lake

Let's say the female doctor, Zhu Airen, was driving her car at lightning speed towards Shi Lake. Because Shi Lake was not very prosperous in the past, except for the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month, which the Suzhou people call watching the "string of moons," filled with boats and songs, and a lot of noise, on ordinary days, you can only see the waves rippling, the distant trees lush, and the smoke and water all over the lake vast. Even watching the "string of moons" on the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month is an unconscious act. Originally, there is a long bridge across the lake called Baodai Bridge, with a total of fifty-three archways. On the night of the seventeenth day of the eighth lunar month, the moonlight shines in the middle of the sky, illuminating the center of the lake. As the lake water flows, the moonlight strings back and forth under the solid bridge. This night scene is said to be somewhat poetic. There is no reason for the whole country to go crazy and have people come to watch it. It is true that there are too many leisure classes in Suzhou. Even when traveling in the mountains and waters, they are in a state of being busy with nothing. There is another thing that is very related to Shi Lake: there is a mountain on Shi Lake called Lengjia Mountain, which the Suzhou people call Shangfang Mountain. On this mountain, the Five Tong Gods are enshrined. The Five Tong Gods are said to be five brothers; there is also a goddess, said to be the mother of the Five Tong Gods. It is not known in what year or month these Five Tong Gods were enshrined, but they are worshiped by a group of female witches. Therefore, the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month, although said to be watching the "string of moons," is actually a temple fair day for these female witches. There is also spirit dancing and rope walking on the mountain, and juggling guns and knives in the lake, partly to entertain the gods and partly to join in the fun. These Five Tong Gods were formerly called licentious gods. During the former Qing Dynasty, they were destroyed by Tang Bin, the governor of Jiangsu; in the Republic of China, they were destroyed by Wang Yincai, the county magistrate of Wu County. However, unexpectedly, the power of folk superstition at that time was still very great, and soon the statues of the Five Tong Gods were erected again. The female witches in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, including Shanghai, all use the Five Tong Gods as a call. Especially those ignorant and low-level people believe in them most deeply. Moreover, Tang Bin, Wang Yincai, etc., failed to thoroughly ban them. This is to eradicate the roots. It has always been said that superstition is not eliminated, science does not participate. Therefore, the emerging China is sparing no effort to eliminate superstition. Like the Five Tong Temple on Shangfang Mountain, the statues have long been destroyed and the temple demolished. It is never allowed to establish such licentious sacrifices elsewhere. If there is such superstition again, the people are allowed to report it and it will be destroyed immediately. Female witches have also disappeared after the war. On the one hand, the people have gradually become enlightened and no longer believe in your nonsense; on the other hand, local autonomy has developed and can strictly prohibit such things as extorting money and deceiving the public. If there are cases of possession by ghosts and gods, they will be sent to mental hospitals immediately. (49)

### Xin Yanqiu is Safe and Sound

—禹公 (Yu Gong)

A famous actor who arrived in Shanghai from Peiping personally confirmed that she will soon go south to exhale the foul air of the former capital.

Regarding the Xin Yanqiu incident, this newspaper was the first to reveal it, and the process from arrest to release was fully published. Yesterday, I happened to talk to an actor who recently arrived in Shanghai from Peiping and is currently performing at a certain theater. He confirmed that Xin Yanqiu is safe and sound, and has been discharged from the hospital, and is still living in Jiang Chaozong's house. According to him, Xin has never officially married Feng Zhi'an, but she was quite friendly with General Song Zheyuan. General Song left Peiping before Feng, and instructed Feng to take Yanqiu with him. Feng had a concubine named Shen Liying. In 1934, she once went south with Shang Xiaoyun to perform at the Samsung Stage (now the Gengxin Stage). After Xiaoyun finished performing, Shen Liying sang for three nights. On the first night, I went with Zhang Xiaochuang and Jiang Junjia to watch her sing "San Niang Teaches Her Son." She was also a rising star and a famous actress. When Feng left Peiping, he entrusted Xin Yanqiu to Jiang Chaozong's care again, while he took Shen Liying and others south. However, there were frequent letters and money exchanges, which was also in accordance with Song Zheyuan's instructions. When Song and Xin Yanqiu met, he strongly advised Xin to stop performing on stage. Yanqiu agreed, which is the origin of the rumor that Xin Yanqiu abandoned the singing stage.

As for Miao Bin's acquaintance with Yanqiu, it was also at this time. However, because Song Zheyuan was there, he did not dare to think improperly. After Song, Feng, and other generals went south, Miao held an important position in the puppet "Provisional Government," and his old habits resurfaced. He used the evil forces of others to oppress this weak woman, and often visited. Although Xin was as beautiful as peach and plum, she was as cold as ice. Miao's scheme failed, but he did not show it on his face, which led to the bloodshed at the Jixiang Theater. Moreover, the box seat on that day was reserved by Miao, and those who invited relatives and friends, there is no trace of clues to be found. Fortunately, Yanqiu has now been discharged from the hospital. This news came from the Liyuan people who recently came to Shanghai, which should be reliable, and can be reassuring for those who care about Xin Yanqiu's life and death.

Also, the Golden Grand Theater in this city, knowing that Yanqiu is safe and sound, has the intention of inviting her to go south. First, because Xin has been away from Shanghai for a long time, her arrival should bring new contributions to entertain the audience; second, the atmosphere in the former capital is foul, and it is appropriate to take a temporary break to breathe some fresh air. It is currently being planned. If so, then the one after Zhang Eyun has been determined to be Meng Xiaodong, and after Meng Xiaodong, it must be Xin Yanqiu. Her sensation in Shanghai is a sure thing.

### Xin Yanqiu's Male Attire

### Jin Suqin to Go to Hong Kong Tomorrow

—海 (Hai)

—A talk before departure

The evening before last, I ran into the famous female performer Jin Suqin in the dressing room of the Carlton Theatre. She is going to Hong Kong tomorrow (2nd) on the President Cleveland, so I took the opportunity to have a long conversation with her. She was wearing a blue cloth cheongsam and lightly powdered, looking very elegant, which reminded me of the saying "a fairy transformed into a human." I smiled and asked her, "Are you really leaving for Hong Kong the day after tomorrow?"

"Yes, they have sent telegrams to urge me, so I can't delay any longer."

"Are you still performing improved Peking Opera in Hong Kong?" I asked again.

She nodded and said, "Of course. Mr. Ouyang Yuqian is there, otherwise I wouldn't go."

"Who is the male lead you are working with, is it Lin Shusen?" I asked.

"Probably, but it hasn't been fully decided yet," she replied.

"I hope the China Opera Troupe will have greater success in Hong Kong than in Shanghai, and that it will always be well organized and consolidated," I said with a blessing.

She smiled and said, "Thank you for your kindness. I hope that like-minded friends will gather together in the future to do the work we should do. But it is difficult without a permanent team. Who would bring 30,000 or 40,000 yuan of family property to perform?"

"I used to have a bad impression of Mr. Ouyang, but recently I have come to appreciate his works and miss him even more. I used to perform vaguely and confusedly, but after his guidance, I understood a little bit about what drama is."

I was familiar with this sentence, so I continued, "After you arrive in Hong Kong, I hope to communicate with you."

"Okay, I will write to you at any time to report on the news about the China Theatre."

Our conversation ended here. That night, after the evening show, the famous amateur Bao Xiaodie and a Miss Lu hosted a banquet for her and Suwen at Xueyuan, accompanied by Wang Xichun, which was also a small farewell banquet.

### Shanghai Amusement Parks

— Fang Lin

The earliest amusement park in Shanghai was found twenty years ago next to the Mud City Bridge racecourse, which is now the advertising space on the west side of the New World. The setup was extremely simple, with a blue reed canopy for a roof and bamboo fences all around. There were Peking operas, local operas, magic shows, ventriloquism, and stand-up comedy. Admission tickets were only ten copper coins. Business was very prosperous during race days. Later, there was "Lou Wai Lou" (Restaurant Outside the Restaurant), located at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, above the Tianchan Stage. Because it was a pioneering effort, it attracted hordes of tourists, and its business was not bad. The amusements were very simple, and the space was small. In less than a few years, "New World" emerged, and "Great World" followed. Inside the city, next to the City God Temple, "Quanye Chang" (Industrial Promotion Center) was also opened, later renamed "Small World." On Simalu (Fourth Avenue) and Daxin Street, the current location of the Times newspaper, "Xiu Yun Tian" (Embroidered Cloud Heaven) was opened, later renamed "Hua Hua Shi Jie" (Flowery World). Among the four major department stores on Nanjing Road, Sincere Company's "Sincere Amusement Park" was the earliest, followed by Wing On Company's "Tian Yun Lou" (Heavenly Melody Building), and then New Sincere Company's "New Sincere Garden" and The Sun Company's "The Sun Amusement Park." The Fu An Company in Xiaodongmen (Small East Gate) also had a "Fu An Amusement Park." Some of them were reorganized, some were renamed, and some were closed. The changes of time evoke a sense of past and present. The "Small World" and "Fu An Amusement Park" in the South City were ravaged by enemy soldiers, making people sigh with regret!

### Lao She in Chongqing

— Xin Guan

Composing Patriotic Ballads

Performed by Dong Lianzhi and Others

Well-known ballad singers Dong Lianzhi, Shanyaodan, and others are currently performing at the Shengping Bookstore in Huixian Bridge, Chongqing. The literary giant Lao She recently composed several popular patriotic ballads, which Dong Lianzhi and others rehearsed thoroughly. They were recently test-performed at the Shengping Bookstore. In addition to Lao She, who wrote the ballads, Zhang Daofan, Wang Pingling, Lao Xiang, He Rong, and other literary figures also attended to listen quietly. The plan is for Lian Xiao to sing "Nanjing Holocaust," Shanyaodan to sing "Illiterate's Joy," Fuguihua to sing "Wuhan Autumn," and Xiaodili to sing "Thrifty Living." The content is all sharp and substantial, and the performers have superb artistry and clear voices, so the audience was moved. These popular patriotic ballads have been praised by the Propaganda Department of the National Government, which considers them to be good social education and will actively promote them.

### Chang Liheng's Borrowing the East Wind

### Prospects for Traditional Opera (III)

— Yu Tang

Now let's talk about Ouyang Yuqian. He devotes himself to traditional opera, film, and drama. He sees that China is progressing, the cultural level is improving, and the audience for drama needs a new kind of nourishment. He is also unwilling to lag behind, aspiring to be a playwright who follows the progress of the great era. On the one hand, because he has been immersed in traditional opera for a long time, he cannot give up his signature skills, all the techniques of Peking Opera, and he knows that wearing a Zhongshan suit and sporting a mustache while singing on stage is not the same as wearing a python robe, jade belt, water sleeves, and beard. Also, cars and airplanes cannot be brought onto the stage, so he wants to adopt the method of putting new wine in old bottles, incorporating some ideas that are in line with the times into traditional opera, letting traditional opera actors sing them, so that the audience can have a fresh experience. His works such as "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" and "Liang Hongyu" have all won praise. I also greatly admire Mr. Ouyang's efforts. His several improved traditional operas are quite successful in terms of ideology, and their novelty of thought is beyond what predecessors could have imagined. Unfortunately, in terms of technique, there is no improvement to speak of. What he plagiarizes from traditional opera is only the dregs, not the essence, which makes the audience feel that they are not watching an improved traditional opera, but a civilization drama in ancient costume. Other performers with new ideas, such as Wang Xiaonong, Feng Zihe, and Zhou Xinfang, have all made similar attempts, but the results have obviously not been as satisfactory as expected. Fortunately, they still retain their status and reputation in traditional opera, so they are not as ungrateful as the Xia brothers, turning traditional opera into jokes like "New Camellia" and "That's Me," which are neither fish nor fowl. Leaving aside "Journey to the West" and "Red Lotus Temple," which rely on mechanical illusions, sensuality, and dancing, if you open the newspaper and look, the "Wen Sucheng," "Good Sisters," and so on, that are being performed in major theaters now, are nominally Peking Opera, but in reality, they are merely civilization dramas in ancient costume that plagiarize a portion of traditional opera techniques.

I dare to boldly say that so-called traditional opera has a supreme position in art, but it has long lost its connection with real life. Now we need another kind of drama to replace the position of traditional opera. Except for a very small number of researchers who are absolutely loyal to traditional opera and a portion of the petit bourgeoisie who miss the golden age of traditional opera and are reluctant to part with it, wanting to find some typical predecessors from the younger generation of actors to comfort their hunger and thirst, traditional opera will not have its large audience.

### Entertainment News

The Tianchan Stage originally invited the clown Li Changshan, who was invited by Huang Guiqiu, but he is still in Hong Kong and has not yet arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, the theater invited the clown Lu Qingyuan the night before last to join the performance of the play "Lantern Riddles."

The newly opened Minle Grand Theater in the French Concession features actors Jiang Yanqin, Rong Qiao Jing, Tao Meijun, Jiao Pengyun, Chen Yunsheng, and Huang Yunsheng. The daytime performance is the complete "The Case of the Swapped Prince," and the nighttime performance is "Zhang Jiuguan." After ten days, they will perform the new play "Hong Jiang, the Female Knight-Errant."

### "Marriage" Four-Day Performance

— Location: Lyceum Theatre

The Shanghai Drama Society's performance of Gogol's famous play "Marriage" to raise funds for the China Children's Welfare Association to support beggar children has been decided to be held at the Lyceum Theatre on Avenue Mailly, Rue Petain in the French Concession on Saturday, March 4, with two performances, daytime and nighttime. Ticket prices are set at five yuan, two yuan, one yuan, and fifty cents for honorary seats. Because the purpose of this performance is to benefit beggar children and the play performed is a satirical comedy that is even more brilliant than "The Government Inspector," and the performers, the Shanghai Drama Society, have a large number of experienced and excellent actors, the results can be predicted to be satisfactory. Reservations can be made at the Lyceum Theatre from now on. The cast of the play is as follows:

Agafya Tikhonovna (played by Xiao Feng), Arina Pantaleimonovna (played by Wu Ming), Fekla Ivanovna (played by Bai Li), Podkolyosin (played by Tie Ma), Kochkarev (played by Xu Li), Fried Egg (played by Zhou Qi), Anuchkin (played by He Bin), Riva Gin (played by Ji Ping), Dunashka (played by Jin Ge), Stepan (played by Shen Ling). It is also learned that a one-act play "Endurance" will be performed at the same time, directed by Fan Fang, with Wang Jixu, Zhang Weisheng, and others as actors.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and the Pear Garden in the Old Capital (116)

Old Tan's Special Skill in "Wulong Courtyard"

Speaking of which, this is not a difficult thing, let alone some kind of hard work. However, this is a secret. If it is not revealed, outsiders will never be able to do it well. When the performer makes the "Sleeping Fish" posture, as long as he clenches his teeth, the skull will swell up, especially the two bones on the left and right temples, which will be higher. The helmet is originally tightly fastened, and at this time, the skull swells, naturally making it even more tight, so how can it fall to the ground?"

From Hou Junshan's words, we can also infer the issue of Old Tan's "Tall Square Scarf." This person never tells the truth very much. Although he exaggerates himself, saying that this is a hard work he has practiced for many years, how do we know if he has any secrets in addition to the effort? Perhaps he is judging from the situation of performing magic tricks, which looks very surprising, making people suspicious and unable to figure it out, but once it is revealed, it is very ordinary. Therefore, he is unwilling to tell people the truth. Later, I heard that there was also a fool inside who wanted to copy this trick, and he practiced hard at home day and night, practicing for more than a year, and broke three or four tall square scarves, but the result was still no effect. Not to mention being able to stand up automatically, I am afraid it will not even move. Unfortunately, Old Tan is dead, so this permanent mystery can only wait for a clever and hardworking opera fan to study it.
