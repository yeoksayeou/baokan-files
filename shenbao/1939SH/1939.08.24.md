### Europe's Crisis Looms: Britain and France Determined to Fulfill Pledge to Poland; Rumors Abound of Germany Intending to Reclaim Pre-War Territories; Chamberlain Sends Letter to Hitler with Grave Warning

London: Following a cabinet meeting this afternoon, the cabinet immediately resolved: (1) to maintain its existing policy toward Poland; (2) to reconvene Parliament on the 24th of this month; (3) to mobilize all reserve forces of the army, navy, and air force. (Havas, 22nd)

London: Following yesterday's cabinet meeting, Sir Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, was instructed to call on Chancellor Hitler and personally deliver a private letter from Prime Minister Chamberlain, the contents of which were also communicated to the French and Polish governments. (Havas, 23rd)

London: British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, has already carried Prime Minister Chamberlain's private letter to Berchtesgaden to call on Chancellor Hitler. Political circles here believe that the content of the letter is a firm warning, stating that if Germany takes action against Poland, it will have a significant impact. The "war of nerves" is irrelevant to Britain. In addition, the British cabinet has reportedly decided to prohibit the export of certain raw materials. Therefore, rubber, cotton, and copper purchased by Germany in London recently may be difficult to transport to Germany. (Havas, 23rd)

Berlin: The rumors circulating that German troops have been ordered to occupy Danzig and the Polish Corridor at dawn tomorrow are denied here today. Responsible parties have heard nothing of such plans. (Reuters, 23rd)

Berlin: German sources now anticipate new developments following German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's arrival in Moscow. They believe that the conclusion and signing of a German-Soviet non-aggression pact are only a matter of hours. After the signing, Germany will quickly implement its subsequent steps. In their opinion, Thursday will be an important date in European history, as German troops are now actively prepared and can mobilize at any time. German officials decline to predict future events, but well-informed German political figures believe that Germany intends to reoccupy all territories it held before World War I. While there is talk of partitioning Poland, the best-informed sources anticipate that an independent Polish state will still exist and will be guaranteed passage through Danzig and Gdynia to the sea to benefit its commerce. (Reuters, 23rd)

Paris: According to reports received here, German troops are concentrating in various locations and will complete this process within three or four days. At that time, if Chancellor Hitler orders an attack, German troops will immediately attack Poland. (Associated Press, 23rd)

Berlin: A member of the National Socialist Party who correctly predicted the fate of Austria and Czechoslovakia stated last night that Poland is now "finished." Poland's future depends entirely on Hitler's will. If Poland accepts German conditions, Germany will only reclaim pre-war German territories. If Poland refuses, German troops will march directly on Warsaw. The mobilization of German reserves demonstrates Hitler's determination to recover lost territories. The tense situation in Europe will reach its peak when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop signs the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. The Germans still hope that this crisis can be resolved in the same way as the Czech crisis last year. The neutrality of the Soviet Union and Germany's strategic advantage will deter Poland from resisting and entice Britain and France to use peaceful means to resolve the Danzig and Corridor issues. All parties here hope that the Soviet-German non-aggression pact can be further advanced to form a military alliance. This Soviet-German non-aggression pact has undoubtedly dealt a major blow to Britain and France, and the Anglo-Franco-Soviet military agreement will be impossible to conclude. (Associated Press, 23rd)

Danzig: National Socialist Party sources today predict that Danzig will be returned to Germany before the end of this week. The first public announcement by a local National Socialist Party leader regarding the date of Danzig's reunification with Germany is noteworthy. One National Socialist Party leader stated, "I believe there will be action within five days." Most National Socialist Party members believe that Germany will reoccupy Danzig after the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty is signed in Moscow. (Associated Press, 23rd)

Warsaw: According to official sources, although Germany and the Soviet Union intend to sign a non-aggression treaty, Poland will still resist aggression with all its might. Polish officials believe that the actions of Germany and the Soviet Union are "unexpected firecrackers in an international card game." According to Polish sources, Poland absolutely does not want to receive military assistance from the Soviet Union, as the threat posed by Soviet troops entering Poland is equivalent to that of the German troops occupying the territory. As for Poland's demands on the Soviet Union, they are limited to economic assistance only. (Associated Press, 23rd)

Warsaw: Military preparations have been actively underway on the Polish border recently. In the Upper Silesia and Voivodeship of Stratov districts, Polish troops are actively building fortifications. All roads approaching the German border have been trenched, and all bridges have been destroyed. (Haitong Telegraph, 23rd)

### British Cabinet Decides to Take Emergency Measures: Extraordinary Parliament to Convene Today; Will Request Full Powers to Cope with Difficult Times

London: The British Cabinet held a full meeting yesterday, lasting for quite some time. In the evening, an official announcement was issued stating that any German-Soviet non-aggression treaty would not affect its obligations to Poland. The British Parliament is scheduled to reconvene tomorrow, at which time both houses will pass the Emergency Powers (Defense) Act, allowing the Central Government to immediately implement any necessary plans when the situation requires. Currently, Britain is arranging precautionary measures, such as the mobilization of certain personnel from the army, navy, and air force, as well as dealing with the export of important raw materials and goods from Britain. Official sources announce that there is no reason to allow the dispute between Germany and Poland to escalate into a European war through the use of force, and there is no problem in Europe that cannot be resolved peacefully when confidence is restored. The British government is constantly preparing to create such a situation, but if Britain strives for this and other countries still insist on using force, then Britain is prepared and determined to resist to the end. The British Cabinet meeting concluded at 5:20 PM, lasting three hours and twenty minutes. Cabinet members appeared cheerful as they left 10 Downing Street. The crowd outside cheered loudly for all cabinet members, and the cheers for the Secretary of State for War, First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air were particularly enthusiastic. It is reported that the Foreign Office was engaged in diplomatic activity throughout the day before the cabinet meeting. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Alexander Cadogan visited Prime Minister Chamberlain at 11:30 AM. Shortly thereafter, the Foreign Office's Chief Diplomatic Advisor Sir Robert Vansittart also went to the Prime Minister's residence. Halifax and Cadogan only left at 1:10 PM. German Chargé d'Affaires Kordt arrived at the British Foreign Office at 1:00 PM for consultations, and the Japanese Ambassador also arrived at the Foreign Office at 5:00 PM. (Reuters, 23rd)

London: All preparations for the convening of Parliament tomorrow have been completed. Last night, the radio station broadcast a notice in the news of its national program, summoning Members of Parliament to London for a meeting. Parliament is scheduled to convene at 1:45 PM tomorrow and will continue to meet during this tense situation. It is reported that the government will ask Parliament to fully pass the Emergency Powers (Defense) Act within one day, giving the government the power to take any steps to cope with difficult times and, if necessary, to act at any time without consulting Parliament. After the passage of this act, the British government will be in the same position as the French government, which now has almost dictatorial power. In other words, the various defense bills passed by Parliament during the Great War will be reimplemented. According to this act, military courts can try and punish those who violate the regulations for maintaining public order and national defense during wartime, and the naval and military administrative councils can take over the production of munitions or

### German Foreign Minister Leads Entourage to Moscow Yesterday Afternoon: Negotiating Non-Aggression Treaty; Building a Foundation for Peace

Moscow: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and his entourage arrived here at 1:00 PM today. Soviet Foreign Vice-Commissar Potemkin, Deputy Commissar of International Trade Khavanov, the Moscow Garrison Commander, representatives of the Moscow Municipal Government, and others welcomed them at the airfield. All personnel of the German Embassy and the Italian Ambassador to the Soviet Union also went to greet them. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)

Berlin: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, accompanied by many important officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including Director of Protocol Doernberg and Director of the Eastern European Department Schalul, who recently represented Germany in signing the German-Soviet commercial agreement, flew to Königsberg (East Prussia) by special plane at 9:00 PM last night. He then transferred to Moscow at 7:00 AM this morning to prepare to sign a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet authorities. (Haitong Telegraph, 23rd)

Berlin: According to well-informed sources, German Foreign Minister's decision to go to Moscow is not only to sign a German-Soviet non-aggression treaty but also to agree with the Soviet Union on the scope of their respective interests. It is also said that during the negotiations, the German side will exchange views with the Soviet side in a frank and sincere manner. Germany's purpose is extremely upright and peaceful. What Germany hopes for is nothing more than building a foundation for peaceful and friendly relations. (Haitong Telegraph, 20th)

Berlin: Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop for half an hour last night before his departure for Moscow. It is reported that he inquired about the proposed German-Soviet agreement and the future of the Anti-Comintern Pact.

Paris: The cabinet held a meeting this afternoon and made no decisions, only approving instructions to be sent to various ambassadors abroad. Afterwards, Premier Daladier met with Chief of the General Staff of National Defense General Gamelin and had a lengthy conversation with him. According to responsible sources, the attitudes of Britain and France have not changed. In other words, if violence occurs in Europe again in the future, they will definitely resist it. (Havas, 23rd)

### Speculation on the Contents of the German-Soviet Pact

Paris: The contents of the non-aggression treaty negotiated between Germany and the Soviet Union are still unknown. Diplomatic circles here are unwilling to express their opinions, only stating that from a legal point of view, the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union may not undergo significant changes due to the non-aggression treaty. The reason is that the two countries signed the Treaty of Rapallo on April 14, 1922, resolving their economic relations. Later, on April 22, 1926, they signed the Treaty of Berlin, which was also a treaty of friendship and neutrality. Article 2 stipulates that if one signatory country, even if it is peaceful, is attacked by a third country, the other party should maintain neutrality. Article 3 stipulates that if a third country organizes an economic group that is detrimental to one signatory country, the other party will not participate. Therefore, it seems that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty cannot add much to this. (Havas, 22nd)

Berlin: The fact that Chancellor Hitler received Turkish Ambassador Papen in Berchtesgaden yesterday was announced at the same time as the news of the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, leading to general suspicion that Mr. Papen also participated in the German-Soviet negotiations. Haitong News Agency has learned from authoritative sources that this speculation is not consistent with the facts. Mr. Papen will not go to Moscow and has returned home due to his mother's death. His talks with the Chancellor and Foreign Minister in Salzburg were all about Turkish affairs. (Haitong Telegraph, 23rd)

Rome: Japanese Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori visited Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday afternoon and discussed the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. It is said that the Japanese government was dismayed upon hearing this. The general public here is commenting on this statement, saying that Japan can at least no longer provide assistance to its German and Italian allies. (Havas, 23rd)

### Britain and France Decide to Suspend Trilateral Staff Talks: But Not to be Considered a Rupture

Paris: According to the "Courage" newspaper, Paris and London have decided to act in complete unison and suspend the Moscow staff talks, but not to break them off. (Reuters, 23rd)

Moscow: According to news from here today, the Anglo-French military delegation held a meeting, which was not attended by the Soviet side. (Reuters, 23rd)

Moscow: Well-informed Soviet sources here today expressed the belief that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty would not conflict with the defensive alliance planned by the Soviet Union, Britain, and France. This statement is considered by qualified observers to be of great significance, as it indicates that the Soviet government still intends to continue the trilateral anti-aggression talks. (Reuters, 23rd)

London: According to a dispatch from the "Daily Mail's" Paris correspondent, the British and French governments last night instructed their ambassadors to the Soviet Union to inform Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov that Poland is now prepared to accept Soviet assistance. The reason for the stagnation of the Moscow trilateral talks was that Poland, in addition to accepting Soviet arms supplies, must also accept Soviet military assistance. The dispatch also stated that the British and French ambassadors will ask Molotov to reply as soon as possible. A Reuters dispatch from Moscow stated that British Ambassador Seeds met with Molotov last night for an hour, the content of which is unknown. (Reuters, 23rd)

London: The British and French ambassadors in Moscow have asked Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to show them the general contents of the proposed German-Soviet non-aggression treaty so that Britain and France can decide on their opinions regarding the staff talks. (Reuters, 23rd)

Paris: According to well-informed sources here, the military talks held by representatives of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow will continue to be held. According to Moscow, the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact does not mean that the trilateral talks cannot continue. However, these talks have been temporarily suspended yesterday. It is believed here that if they can be resumed, the representatives of Britain and France will not readily disclose military secrets. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)

### Italy's Policy: Adhering to Original Course; Decides to Adapt to New Situation with "Realistic Spirit"

Rome: Italy has quickly adapted to the new situation created by the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty with a "realistic spirit." Government authorities have not provided the public with any explanation as to why the policies of the Axis powers have suddenly shifted towards the Soviet Union. Newspapers emphasize that the Italian government's policy is still based on selectivity and adherence to its original course. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said, "If military action or a crusade-style war had been imposed on the Soviet Union in the past, Italy would certainly not have participated." Foreigners who hear all this are surprised. Observers say that the Soviet Union was ignored by Britain and France at last year's Munich Conference, and the Soviet Union's decision to negotiate a non-aggression treaty with Germany is to avenge this humiliation. (Havas, 23rd)

### British Shipbuilding Program Reaches Peak: Three Ships Launched in Two Days

London: The British shipbuilding program is accelerating, with three cruisers launched in two days, setting a new world record. Among the three cruisers, the "Nigeria" and "Mauritius" are 8,000-ton class, equipped with many 6-inch guns. The "Dido" is slightly lighter than the previous two but is also equipped with 6-inch guns. In the next few months, two 35,000-ton battleships equipped with 10-inch guns and two 23,000-ton aircraft carriers will be launched. Soon, four more cruisers and many destroyers will be launched. The British shipbuilding program has reached its peak. In a few months, a large fleet will actually be launched. There are 24 warships under construction on the Tyne River, with all shipyards working at full capacity. The cost of shipbuilding is estimated at US$350 million. (Associated Press, 23rd)

Malta: The barbed wire defense of the Malta coast has now been electrified, one of the military preparedness plans adopted by the authorities. All garrisoned soldiers are prepared to cope with any eventuality. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Many Shortcomings in British Food Management

London: Sir William Beveridge, a key figure in the Food Ministry during the last Great War, said in a speech to the Norwich Industrial Transport Association that Britain's current food supply situation is worse than during the last Great War. "The government's 'Food Defence' Committee actually has no food to supply for it to manage. If there is food to be supplied, then there is no need for 'defence' at all. The committee's food control and distribution work is no different from that during the last Great War." Sir William Beveridge continued, "The government should quickly purchase wheat produced in Canada. Today, the British population has greatly increased compared to the past, but there are fewer merchant ships and the number of farmers has also greatly decreased. Increasing domestic food production is the most important thing for national defense today." (Associated Press, 23rd)

### Hong Kong's Trade with Japan Increases Sharply

Hong Kong: According to a report from the Hong Kong Imports and Exports Statistics Department, Hong Kong's imports and exports totaled 96.5 million yuan, with imports at 50.8 million yuan and exports at 45.7 million yuan, both of which increased compared to the same period last year.

Editorial

### How to Eliminate Rice Panic

The Shanghai rice problem, which has remained unresolved for a long time, has recently worsened. Not only has the price of rice far exceeded the limit set by the Public Works Department, but it is even becoming difficult to buy rice with money, gradually creating a sense of panic. This has caused great social unrest. Shanghai is currently home to over four million Chinese and foreign residents, and allowing this state of unrest to continue spreading would create a very serious social crisis.

The main reason why the Shanghai rice problem has not been resolved is the so-called manipulation of the special environment, which has disrupted the normal functioning of the supply side and allowed unscrupulous merchants to manipulate the sales side. In terms of supply, Shanghai's rice used to come from Wuxi and Changshu in the near vicinity, and from the Yangtze River region in the distance. Now, along the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, either farming cannot be carried out as usual, or the rice is bought up at the place of production, or exorbitant taxes are levied during transportation, or it is forcibly seized when it arrives near Shanghai. This makes it difficult for the rice to reach the Shanghai concessions. In terms of sales, since Shanghai became a special environment, the Chinese government has been unable to enforce its laws. As a result, unscrupulous merchants have been speculating and hoarding, deliberately raising rice prices in order to make huge profits. Although the Public Works Department has set price limits and rice industry groups have tried to curb price increases, these efforts have not been effective in practice. Recently, a very serious rice shortage has developed. Is it really the case that there is no rice left in the warehouses of Shanghai, and that the streets are truly bare? This cannot but make people suspicious!

To find a fundamental solution to the above-mentioned problems, unless the Chinese government can break this special environment in the future and enforce the law, this is currently not possible. However, in order to maintain social tranquility in Shanghai, we cannot but earnestly hope that the concession authorities and the people within the concessions will cooperate closely to prevent the development of panic through appropriate means. Yesterday, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession submitted a letter to the Public Works Department, suggesting three measures to solve the rice panic: (1) actively dredge the sources of supply; (2) gradually purchase and store rice, implementing price stabilization measures, with any losses temporarily covered by loans, and then seek to make up for them; and (3) investigate the rice stocks of all banks, money houses, warehouses, rice merchants, and individuals, ordering them to sell at the set price or half price within a set time limit. The third measure is actually the only emergency countermeasure at present; the first and second measures are longer-term policies to stabilize rice prices. However, in terms of the capabilities of the concession authorities, apart from the first measure, which requires consultation with relevant parties, the concession authorities have the possibility of immediately implementing the other two measures. Given the status of the concession authorities, it is expected that they will be able to lead the leaders of Shanghai's financial community to jointly raise funds for price stabilization measures, in order to benefit all residents within the concessions. The emergency measures taken by the concession authorities regarding rice after the "August 13th" incident two years ago are very commendable. It is perfectly acceptable to use the same method again to deal with the current situation. As for investigating rice stocks and forcing price stabilization sales, this is even easier to do. For the sake of the tranquility of all Shanghai residents, restricting the hoarding and monopolization of a small number of people has the same social significance as prohibiting opium and gambling. Moreover, the concession administrative authorities have the primary task of maintaining law and order within the concessions, and the rice problem is closely related to law and order. Therefore, the concession authorities have a major responsibility for solving the rice problem. Furthermore, it must be understood that if the concession authorities cannot show their strength on this issue, the concession will face other difficulties. In order to avoid these difficulties, the concession authorities should promptly implement these effective solutions to the rice problem, which is related to law and order.

We also want to solemnly tell the hoarders: at this time and in this place, everyone should be able to replace the laws of the Chinese government with compassion. The current Shanghai is like a lone boat in the ocean, and everyone should help each other in the spirit of sharing the same boat and waiting for the final victory in a difficult environment. Do not imitate the behavior of pirates, taking this opportunity to rob others. It must be understood that human survival is collective, and the chaos of the entire society does not allow for the existence of individual safety. We should immediately awaken, sacrifice the small self, and give up the attempt to speculate and profit. Even if we seek profit, we should not target rice as a means of monopolization. We also hope that the Shanghai rice industry and people from all walks of life can use collective power to thoroughly investigate the rice speculation situation in the Shanghai market, and impose social sanctions on a small number of unscrupulous merchants based on humanitarian justice. Use the police force of the concession to sell the hoarded rice in various warehouses at fair prices to eliminate the current panic. In addition, the banking and money industries, which are closely related to the rice industry, should, on the one hand, report the bad apples in the industry and not sit idly by as they use public deposits to engage in hoarding activities that are detrimental to society. It must be known that they are pests in society and black sheep in the banking and money industries, which will adversely affect the entire banking and money industries! At the same time, loans must be issued carefully and not be used by speculators. Not only that, but the banking and money industries should also gather their peers, invite public organizations, and cooperate with the concession authorities and the residents of the concession in the procurement and distribution of rice on as large a scale as possible, in order to solve the current food problem, which is also the way to eliminate the social crisis. As for the residents: first, they should not store excessive amounts of rice, so as not to help the schemes of unscrupulous merchants and increase the severity of the problem; second, they should not act rashly, so as not to promote social unrest; third, they should either take the household as a unit, or organize consumer cooperatives, and first find ways to solve the rice problem individually, and try to change to eating various coarse grains. We will target the seriousness of the rice problem and everyone will be responsible. Whether it is eating noodles, wheat, or even sweet potatoes and taro, deciding every few days is good, and doing so every day is even better. In wealthy families, they are not worried about the high price of rice, but it is a reasonable approach to change to eating bread and biscuits, which are more expensive than rice, for the sake of the public who lack rice.

### Japanese Troops Massing on Hong Kong Border; British Troops Demolishing Several Bridges; Authorities Order British Residents in Kowloon to Relocate; Japanese Troops Landing at Nantou Repelled

Hong Kong: Reuters has learned that some of the bridges connecting the Chinese territory to the British territory have been ordered to be demolished. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Hong Kong: Japanese troops are massing outside the Hong Kong border. Today, four Japanese patrol ships arrived at Nantou, and many armed small boats continued to arrive at Taishan Bay outside Nantou. British and Indian military police are still patrolling within the border line. The border is currently peaceful. Reuters learned from non-official sources that foreign women and children residing in the New Territories have been instructed by the authorities to move to the city to prevent unforeseen events. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Hong Kong: Today's English-language newspapers here reported that the British military authorities have cut off the bridges leading to the Shenzhen River. British people living near the border have been advised to either move to Kowloon or to the mainland to avoid unforeseen events. It is said that Japanese troops continue to land at Nantou, carrying heavy artillery and machine guns. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

Hong Kong: Shaoguan reports that Japanese troops on Hainan Island have been mobilized and increased, and it is rumored that they will harass Beihai and Yangjiang. The Japanese landing at Nantou was repelled. The fighting in Sanjiang is still fierce. Japanese troops in Muzhou have returned to Japanese boats. Transportation between Macau and Siyi has been interrupted. (Special dispatch, 23rd)

Hong Kong: This afternoon, the British military authorities here ordered the demolition of two bridges on the Kowloon border facing the Japanese troops. At the same time, British residents now in Kowloon were advised to move to Hong Kong as early as possible. Hong Kong government officials believe that this is purely a precautionary measure. According to sources close to the government, the Hong Kong government's actions are due to two reasons: first, heavy troops have been gathered on the Japanese side of the Kowloon border; second, four Japanese cruisers arrived in Taishan Bay across from Nantou this morning. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

Hong Kong: The Japanese have built two artillery forts in Shenzhen and fortifications on the hilltop near the railway station, confronting the New Territories. The situation on the Sino-British border is becoming increasingly tense. The Hong Kong authorities have notified British women and children living in Fanling to evacuate the area, saying that this is a defensive measure. The bridges at key points on the border have also begun to be removed. (Special dispatch, 23rd)

Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman reported on the actions of Japanese troops near Hong Kong at yesterday's weekly intelligence conference, and said that the activities of Japanese warships near Hainan Island prove that the Japanese army intends to invade Beihai. Regarding the battle situation in Shanxi, the spokesman declared that the Japanese army's plan to break through the Shanxi guerrilla units with infantry had failed, and that they have now switched to bombing. However, due to the undulating mountains, this tactic is also difficult to be effective. The war situation on the central China front is very quiet, with only minor skirmishes by guerrilla units. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

Luoyang: The Central News Agency reporter recently interviewed a commander who previously served under the former Qian Supervisor. According to him, five divisions of Japanese troops, totaling about 100,000 men, were mobilized in southeast Shanxi and harassed the entire highway. After fierce interception by the Chinese army, the strongholds have been recovered one after another. Recently, Jincheng, the last city, was also surrounded by the Chinese army from all sides and captured in one fell swoop in ten days. In total, the Japanese army suffered 15,000 to 20,000 casualties. After this major blow, not only was the dream of "sweeping away" the guerrilla base area of ​​the Taihang Mountains shattered, but it will also be unable to commit any more crimes in the short term.

### Anti-British Movement Intensifying

Beiping: Leng Jiaji, chairman of the Anti-British Association of Beiping, told Japanese and Chinese journalists yesterday that British residents in Beiping must immediately give up their rented residences, or they will face more inconveniences. Unless Britain accepts the demands of the Anti-British Association, the association will take "indirect action" against British residents, such as stopping the supply of telephones, water, and garbage collection. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

Beiping: The film "The Little Princess," starring Shirley Temple, was suspended from screening at the Pingan Cinema here yesterday because the cinema manager received a notice from the Japanese military police and the Chinese police that "this kind of pro-British film is a crime of treason." (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

Beiping: The anti-British movement here has undergone a new transformation. Now, famous buildings are being used for propaganda purposes. Countless anti-British posters have been pasted all over the famous Temple of Heaven. The Sino-British Theatre has been closed due to the activities of the vigilantes. These vigilantes threatened Chinese people and advised them not to enter the theatre. Other vigilantes went upstairs to attack the theatre manager's office because the theatre is now showing "The Little Princess," starring Shirley Temple, which they oppose because they believe the film has a pro-British stance. The Reuters office was surrounded by vigilantes yesterday. After the Chinese staff of Reuters left the office, the vigilantes attempted to obtain news of Reuters' activities.

Tianjin: Although the British consulate here admitted today that there is an anti-British movement in the Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe areas, the situation is not serious, so British residents there do not need to evacuate. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

### Severe Flooding in Tianjin; Japanese Residents Flee to Beiping

Beiping: The Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin has become a waterborne event as a result of the flooding. According to visitors, Japanese soldiers are doing their best to maintain the blockade, with sentries stationed in front of all obstacles on boats or motorboats. Although the operation of the Pingjin Railway is now greatly delayed, it is still being maintained. Two trains arrived yesterday, delayed by several hours, fully loaded with evacuees, including 600 Japanese people from the Japanese concession in Tianjin. It is said that the flooding in the Japanese concession is more severe than elsewhere. It continued to rise last night, and the streets are deeply flooded. There is still water supply in the British concession in Tianjin, but there is no electricity. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Beiping: Six hundred Japanese residents of Tianjin, in view of the fact that the flooding of the foreign concessions in Tianjin will continue to rise by the end of this week, came here last night to seek refuge. People from third countries will also arrive here in the next few days. Food prices have risen sharply due to the continuous arrival of refugees, but the food shortage here has been slightly alleviated due to the arrival of 500,000 bags of Australian flour from Tianjin. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

Tianjin: The commander of the Japanese army in Tianjin issued a statement yesterday afternoon, asking the people to cooperate with the local Japanese officials to prevent floods, and said that the authorities will do their best to maintain law and order, traffic, and provide disaster relief. Anyone living in Tianjin, whether Chinese, Japanese, or from a third country, will be able to receive assistance. This statement also announced that the following persons will be punished: (1) those who rebel against Japan and those who instigate rebellion against Japan; (2) those who break into other people's houses, or rob or set fires; (3) those who spread rumors; (4) those who hoard food or deliberately raise prices; and (5) those who do not obey the orders of the commander of the Japanese garrison. The statement also advised the victims to move to safe locations outside Tianjin. Special trains are available at Tianjin North Station to transport the victims out of the country. The seven checkpoints around the British concession are still maintained as usual by small boats. The Italian concession was not flooded, while the Japanese, French, and British concessions were all flooded. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Tianjin: Today, due to the continued heavy rain, the water in the low-lying areas is already ten feet deep. The situation of the thousands of refugees who have taken refuge in the British and French concessions is extremely pitiful. The terrain of the Italian concession in Tianjin is the highest in Tianjin, so it has become an "island" in Tianjin, but the Italian concession is already full of refugees, so it can no longer accommodate the relocation of refugees. Most Japanese are now trying to leave here to go to Beiping. It is reported that 600 people have arrived in Beiping. However, it is widely rumored here that the tracks have been washed away by the water in several places, so British residents who want to go to Beiping can only postpone their departure for the time being. It is also reported that 500,000 bags of foreign flour from Tianjin have been transported to Beiping, so the food supply here will become a major problem. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

### Roosevelt Plans to Make Another World Peace Appeal; US Government Discussing Neutrality; American Residents in Europe Preparing to Evacuate

Washington: After the sudden worsening of the European situation, President Roosevelt, who was originally cruising in the Pacific Ocean, has returned here and will arrive on the 25th, and may make a final effort for peace. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

Washington: According to news from here today, President Roosevelt will again make a call for saving peace, similar to the one made last September. Because in addition to instructing the competent authorities to make detailed reports on the European situation, President Roosevelt will also suspend his summer vacation and return to Washington on Friday. However, Secretary of State Hull returned here today, and Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison, Undersecretary of the Army Johnson, Chief of Staff Marshall, Secretary of the Air Force Arnold, and Deputy Chief of Protocol Bailey of the State Department all met with Undersecretary of State Welles to discuss the issue of US neutrality and how to protect the safety of American residents overseas. According to Polish Ambassador to the United States Puyotoki's visit to Welles, Poland is determined to fight to defend its territory. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)

Washington: The European situation suddenly became tense. Under Secretary of State Welles convened senior officials from various government departments this afternoon to study the two issues of maintaining the neutrality of the United States in wartime and protecting the lives and property of American expatriates in Europe. Representatives of the Federal Shipping Board immediately declared that the plan to evacuate American expatriates in Europe has already been drafted. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

Washington: When officials here first heard the news that Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed to conclude a non-aggression treaty, they were shocked. Now that the shock has subsided, they are reconsidering and feel that the disaster is not as serious as they initially thought. Because the State Department has not yet learned its contents, it does not want to make any criticism of this. However, well-informed sources enumerated the following points as slightly reassuring: (1) Since the Soviet Union has asked Britain for a high price, it may not give Germany a free hand in Eastern Europe and abandon its right to demand a considerable price; (2) Is it in the interest of the Soviet Union for Germany to continue its aggression in Eastern Europe? The Soviet Union has not failed to know this; (3) Hitler has weakened the anti-communist front and put Japan in the Far East in a dangerous situation that can withstand stronger resistance from China and the Soviet Union. The price he paid is indeed not small. The above third section often makes American people satisfied, but there is a regret that can offset it, that is, although the aggression in the Far East has been frustrated, the European peace front, allowing it is British diplomacy, has suffered a serious blow. President Roosevelt has repeatedly wanted to strengthen British diplomacy in recent months. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Washington: Government officials here believe that if the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty is established, the Soviet Union may take a leap and dominate the situation in the Far East. At the same time, the prosperity of the Soviet Union's power in the Far East is also enough to increase the position of the United States in the East. Furthermore, after the Soviet Union gets rid of the constraints in Europe, it will be easier to help China from now on. However, in order to obtain compensation from China, the big ones will require China to continue to make concessions to communism. In short, it is very clear that the Soviet Union's action is to avoid fighting a major war in Europe and is willing to fight a smaller war in the Far East. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

Washington: The US government is preparing to evacuate expatriates from European countries. It is said that there are more than 100,000 American expatriates in European countries. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

### Germany and the Soviet Union Join Hands; Japan is Perplexed and Distraught; Oshima Ordered to Inquire About Germany's True Intentions; Prime Minister and Army Minister Discuss Countermeasures

Tokyo: After Berlin announced the news that Germany and the Soviet Union were about to sign a non-aggression treaty, the Japanese government instructed Ambassador to Germany Oshima to inquire about Germany's views. As soon as news is received, a cabinet meeting will be held to study the new situation and may take decisions with significant meaning. (Haitong dispatch)

Tokyo: Regarding the conclusion of the non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany, the Japanese government authorities are quite embarrassed and distressed. Therefore, they will immediately ask Germany to explain the meaning of its surprising move. According to Japanese reports, Foreign Minister Arita will first inquire about Germany's "true intentions," and then the Japanese cabinet will reconsider its European policy. Most Japanese newspapers are instructed by the government to write articles saying, "The diplomatic relations between Germany and Japan have always been cordial. Now we are surprised to hear the news that Germany has taken new actions, and everyone feels extremely regret." Although Japanese newspapers admit that diplomatic policy may need to be revised, most newspapers insist that the new treaty "may not contradict" the anti-communist agreement. It is said that Prime Minister Hiranuma will meet with Army Minister Itagaki this afternoon in order to reach a preliminary decision on future European policy. However, according to well-informed sources, Hiranuma and Itagaki will definitely discuss the inevitability of changing the entire diplomatic policy. Prince Konoe Fumimaro, President of the Privy Council, rushed back to Tokyo last night in order to discuss countermeasures with government leaders. He will probably discuss solutions with Prime Minister Hiranuma this afternoon. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

### Japanese Side Denies Brewing Cabinet Reshuffle

Tokyo: Semi-official Japanese sources here claim that the rumors that a cabinet reshuffle is about to occur are completely untrue. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Tokyo: Prime Minister Hiranuma and Army Minister Sakamoto had a secret meeting for several hours this afternoon. Afterwards, the Prime Minister also met with the President of the Privy Council, so there were widespread rumors that the cabinet might be reorganized. However, government officials have denied this rumor. At the same time, diplomatic envoys from France, Poland, and the United States visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs one after another to inquire about the Japanese government's countermeasures to the new situation in Europe. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "Although the situation in Europe has changed, it does not affect Japan's established policy. We are not very concerned about the changes in the European situation." The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs admitted that the Japanese government had no prior knowledge of the new changes in Europe. The news that the Japanese government received was the report from Ambassador Oshima in Germany yesterday. As for the details of Germany's willingness to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a report, so it cannot express its opinion. "However, we hope that the non-aggression treaty signed by Germany and the Soviet Union will not conflict with the tripartite anti-communist agreement." (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)

### Abnormal Activities in Tokyo Diplomacy

Tokyo - Today, both the Japanese diplomatic and political circles are extremely active. The Polish Ambassador to Japan visited Foreign Minister Arita this morning. Shortly after, French Ambassador Henry visited Foreign Vice-Minister Sawada. The Polish Embassy's Counselor, Michalowski, also visited the Director-General of the European Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Simultaneously, government leaders held important meetings to discuss the new situation in Europe. Prime Minister Hiranuma had a closed-door meeting with Army Minister Itagaki this afternoon. It is reported that Itagaki presented the Army's frank opinions to Hiranuma. (Reuters, 23rd)

### How to Dissipate Isolation

Tokyo - When the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with reporters this morning, he acknowledged the possibility of a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Japan. It is claimed that Japan's policy is to oppose communism to defend the Japanese Empire, and this policy is unchangeable. Japan is currently awaiting more detailed information from Berlin regarding the proposed non-aggression terms between Germany and the Soviet Union. Therefore, when reporters questioned this matter, the spokesperson cautiously replied that it is currently impossible to accurately interpret the overall situation. However, we hope that Germany will not take measures that contradict the anti-communist pact. It is still unclear whether the new German-Soviet treaty is a new direction for us or a revival of the previous Soviet-German non-aggression treaty. Someone asked, "If the anti-communist pact is not against the Soviet Union, then who is it against?" The spokesperson gave an evasive answer, only saying that the anti-communist pact "is still a living tool." However, the spokesperson believes that the possibility of a breakdown in German-Soviet negotiations is quite low. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Eastern Reports Acknowledge Facing Difficulties

Tokyo - Today, newspapers here published editorials on the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, believing that it will not only affect Europe but also the Far East. Japan's Hirochi Newspaper stated that the Soviet Union will act freely in the Far East because it is rumored that this treaty will effectively sweep away the anti-communist pact. The only glimmer of hope that Germany provides regarding this matter is that Germany had foreseen all possibilities and considered its relationship. The meaning of this message may vary, but policy changes in history are most surprising. Aside from that, nothing else is different. If the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression treaty proposed by Moscow is realized, then the required transformation will not be considered significant. With the guarantee of no attacks from both the East and West, the Soviet Union can sit back and watch the world kill each other while building up its production capacity, selling goods to belligerent countries to become rich, and waiting for the time to spread its communism amid world turmoil. The Daily News stated that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty is bound to affect the Far East, and the government should carefully inspect the new situation, not be driven by emotions, firmly adhere to the strategy of independent action, and focus on the satisfactory resolution of the China Incident. The Asahi Shimbun stated that Germany wants to obtain a bloodless solution to the Danzig problem and wants to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, which must also pay attention to the Far East. Regardless of the consequences, Japan must carry out its work of creating a new order in East Asia and does not need to pay much attention to the new changes in the European situation. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Chamberlain's realistic policy is not as advanced as Stalin's more advanced realistic policy. "Kokumin Shimbun," which advocated joining the Axis military alliance, did not comment on the German-Soviet treaty, but said that Japan, two years into the war in China, is now gradually encountering real difficulties. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Chongqing Newspaper Observes Benefit to China

Chongqing - This morning, newspapers here published the news that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty is about to be signed in a particularly prominent position and expressed unanimous opinions, saying that the rapprochement between the two countries will be beneficial to China's resistance against Japan. The Central Daily News, a Chinese government agency, stated that the new changes in the international situation may shock Britain and France, but it can be safely predicted that the Soviet Union will continue to exert pressure for world peace and will continue to support the collective security plan. Japan is now isolated and helpless, and it will be at a loss as to what kind of foreign policy it should adopt in the future. The "Wipe Out" newspaper, an organ of the Chinese Army, expressed optimism about the news of the Soviet-German rapprochement, as did Chinese people in Shanghai and other places. The newspaper attached great importance to the news of the Soviet Union's troops stationed on the "Manchuria" border. The Xinmin Daily News stated that the Soviet Union decided to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Germany in the hope of peace. This treaty does not conflict with the anti-aggression alliance of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, even though Germany and the Soviet Union have come closer again, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are still expected to conclude an agreement in the near future. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Major Failure of British Diplomacy

London - Evening newspapers here commented on the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, all saying that the effectiveness of this resolution cannot restrict the Soviet Union's actions when Germany invades a third country. This point is particularly emphasized by the newspapers. "The Standard" stated that this treaty is bound to make the European situation worse. The German side believes that the treaty has been concluded, but the Soviet Union believes that Ribbentrop's visit to Moscow is only the beginning of negotiations. The establishment of a treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany is the culmination of the Soviet Union's isolation policy after Litvinov's departure. "The News Evening Post" commented that it was a major failure of British diplomacy, but the determination of Britain and France to fulfill their obligations is not weakened by this. All newspapers unanimously believe that this treaty is a major blow to Japan. (22nd dispatch)

London - "The Manchester Guardian" published an article today criticizing the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, stating that if this news is surprising to Europe, it must be shocking to Japan. This treaty may not be of much value, and if it is not beneficial to Germany, it will not harm Japan. However, even if this situation is true, the Japanese government will find it difficult to trust Germany's future assistance. If Germany is willing to sacrifice Japan's interests in the Far East for its own benefit, then Germany is obviously willing to do so. Japan, understanding this situation, will definitely think twice before taking on supporting Germany's ambitions in Europe. Currently, Japan views Germany as Britain views the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 23rd)

### German Newspapers Comment with Complacency

Berlin - Regarding the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, newspapers here began to write detailed commentaries last night. The general tone is that the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact is a manifestation of Germany's realistic diplomatic policy, and it is also the direct result of Britain's rejection of reaching an understanding with Germany and pursuing a policy of encirclement. Newspapers traced the historical events of the 19th century when Prussia, Austria, and Tsar Alexander I cooperated to deal with Napoleon, and Bismarck provided a guarantee treaty to Russia, the friendship between Germany and the Soviet Union. The "Hamburg Local Daily" stated that "Britain's hesitation ultimately led to the failure of the long-running Moscow talks, which further demonstrated Germany's ability to seize opportunities and take appropriate actions. Germany will never allow its traditional rights to be deprived. The conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact is the inevitable result of the encirclement policy. Countries advocating the encirclement policy have always believed that Germany and the Soviet Union are incompatible and that conflicts will inevitably occur sooner or later. They did not expect that Germany and the Soviet Union would restore the traditional friendly relationship before Bismarck stepped down, and this relationship continued for several years after the World War." The "Berlin Evening Post" commented that "Germany and the Soviet Union have no territorial disputes. From now on, democratic countries should recognize that the fate of Europe is in the hands of the Axis powers." "The German General Report" commented that European politics and the world situation have now been changed. Germany has repeatedly declared to the world that Germany will never allow the history of the European War to repeat itself today and in the future. It has now been seen in fact. The German people express their extreme welcome to the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, which is transforming the world situation." The newspaper then quoted British Lloyd George as saying, "If the peace front does not include the Soviet Union, it will become an empty organization without political and military value." Indeed, Britain has now lost this opportunity to oppose Germany's continental policy. (Haitong Dispatch, 23rd)

### Italian Newspapers Write Articles to Vigorously Praise

Rome - "Italian News" editor Gaida recently published an article in the newspaper commenting on the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact. The article stated, "Poland is now isolated. If Britain and France still want to fulfill their guarantee obligations to Poland, they cannot obtain Soviet assistance. The news of the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact came suddenly and was truly surprising. However, Italy had previously warned Poland of the crisis in its geographical location and that the millions of Ukrainians and Belarusians within its borders were a source of unrest. Britain and France have been negotiating to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union for four months, and nothing has been achieved. But German leader Hitler made a move that determined the overall situation. The world situation changed in an instant." (Haitong Dispatch, 23rd)

### French Newspapers Suspect and Uneasy about the Soviet Union

Paris - The commentaries in today's French newspapers are largely similar to yesterday's. The Times has always taken a pro-Soviet stance, but today it also published a lengthy editorial, believing that the Soviet Union's conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with Germany is like stabbing a friendly country with seven heads, which is chilling. Most French newspapers believe that it is difficult to speculate on the background of the Soviet Union's adoption of a new policy, and perhaps there will be further surprising changes. (Haitong Dispatch, 23rd)

Paris - French newspapers now say that Moscow is indecisive and has recently established trade ties with Germany. Therefore, the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty was expected. This treaty may not produce the results that Germany expects. "The Paris Times" referred to this as a major change in policy and doctrine in European history, saying that the German government is in a desperate situation and has to open up new paths. Although the non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union contradicts the essence of all things, it is the safest way to prevent the establishment of a military alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. This move is indeed bold, but it is unlikely that the desired results will be achieved. This treaty has clearly eliminated the anti-communist pact, and any plans that Germany intends to extend its influence to the Balkan countries, Ukraine, or the Black Sea will be shelved as a result. People cannot help but have a view that Hitler, after realizing that he is in a difficult position, wants to use lightning-fast means to resolve the crisis he has created and make a strategic withdrawal. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Soviet Air Force Bombing on the Manchurian Border Intensifies

Changchun - Japanese troops here announced today that since the news of the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty was announced, the bombing attacks by the Soviet Air Force in "Manchukuo" have intensified compared to before. On Monday, the day the news was announced, there were four Soviet aircraft raids. Japanese aircraft immediately took off to meet the enemy and engaged in large-scale air combat. The conflict on the Soviet-"Manchuria" border has been continuous every day since May 21. It is determined that the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty will allow the Soviet Union to have no worries in the West, and in the Far East, it can act freely. The Japanese side admits that the hidden worries for the future will inevitably grow. Five Japanese aircraft failed to return after the air combat on Monday. The Japanese report did not specify the air combat zone, but the conflict zone on Sunday morning was known to be in the Harlun-Erel Mountain area, an important railway point on the Outer Mongolian border. The Japanese side claimed that a total of forty-six Soviet aircraft were shot down in the air combat on Sunday. (Associated Press, 23rd)

### Vladivostok Shipyard's Newly Built Warships Will Soon Join the Pacific Fleet

Moscow - The first new Soviet warship built by the Vladivostok Shipyard will soon join the Pacific Fleet. The contents of the ship are unknown to outsiders, but it is said that there are thousands of shipyard workers, which shows that it must be a giant warship. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Japanese Secretly Investigate Philippine Minerals

Manila - According to the Philippine News, Japanese disguised as fishermen are very active along the coast of Surigao Province. In fact, these fishermen are mostly geologists, intending to investigate the minerals in the Tinaga area. In the past month, a 40-ton yacht was often seen off the coast of Tinaga, pretending to be fishing. At the same time, several local Filipinos acted as guides for the Japanese on the ship, venturing deep inland. When local police inquired about what was going on, they would avoid the yacht and sail to the location of the large ship outside the harbor. (Associated Press, 23rd)

### Netherlands Calls Up Reservists

The Hague - In view of the recent changes in the international situation, the Dutch government yesterday issued a decree to call up reservists, including the Coast Guard, Border Guard, and Air Force (Every Day Telegraph, 23rd)

### London High Court Rejects Habeas Corpus Case, British Foreign Secretary's Representative Presents Views in Court

London - High Court Judge Cassels today rejected the application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of the four Tianjin suspects. (Reuters, 23rd)

London - Regarding the writ of habeas corpus case for the four Tianjin suspects, High Court Judge Cassels opened the trial again this morning. The lawyers for the application were Sir Monckton and two civilians, while Walker represented Foreign Secretary Halifax. When Walker continued his argument today, he submitted a book obtained from the Foreign Office to the judge, which contained various treaties related to British-Chinese relations. Walker stated that Britain has no other rights in China except those based on various treaties. The plan to extend habeas corpus to non-British Empire people is unheard of. In fact, this power only belongs to the British King over his own people, but not over non-British people. Sir Monckton, the lawyer for the application, responded to Walker's mention of the position of the Aid China Movement Committee, saying that Lord Listowel personally cares about the safety of the four Tianjin suspects and has obtained the entrustment of these four people to apply for a writ of habeas corpus on their behalf. He has received a telegram from Attorney Issembert in Tianjin, stating, "The four suspects have commissioned you as their representative." (Reuters, 23rd)

London - When High Court Judge Cassels handled the petition for a writ of habeas corpus today, Foreign Secretary Halifax's representative, Walker, insisted that the detention of the four suspects in the British Concession in Tianjin was based on a treaty, so this was a national action. As for whether it was based on the treaty, the court could not investigate. The Foreign Office has received notification from the Chinese local court in the last 48 hours that it is prepared to welcome the extradition of the prisoners. No one wants to see the prisoners extradited until the court makes a ruling on the current case. The case is scheduled to continue tomorrow (Reuters, 22nd)

### European Chronicle for the Past Two Weeks: August 10-22

Paris - After Germany and the Soviet Union decided to sign a non-aggression treaty, there was talk that German troops would occupy the Polish Corridor starting at noon on the 24th of this month, and the situation in Eastern Europe became even more tense. The following is a supplement to the European events from August 10 to August 22 for reference:

August 10: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano went to Salzburg, Germany, to hold important talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Danzig National Socialist Party leader Forster gave a speech, once again stating that the city's residents support leader Hitler. British Foreign Secretary Halifax also reiterated his determination to fulfill his obligations to Poland.

August 11: Italy called up two levels of reservists. The British Air Force held exercises on a scale unprecedented since the end of the European War. The Italian semi-official newspaper issued a statement saying that if the democratic countries assist Poland when Germany and Poland go to war, Italy should assist Germany.

August 12: The foreign ministers of Italy and Germany went to Berchtesgaden to meet with leader Hitler. German newspapers stepped up their anti-Polish propaganda campaign and expanded the scope of their demands, wanting to recover the Polish Corridor. Danzig National Socialist Party leader Forster gave a speech reiterating his determination to incorporate Danzig into Germany.

August 13: After leader Hitler received Italian Foreign Minister Ciano again, Ciano rushed back to Rome. The German official also stated that the results of the talks were sufficient to prove the united relationship of the Axis powers.

August 14: League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, Burckhardt, went to Berchtesgaden to meet with German leader Hitler.

August 15: The Italian authorities issued a statement saying that the talks between the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy were actually the last warning from the Axis powers to the democratic countries.

August 16: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop held talks with Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky again.

August 17: Germany is scheduled to hold a memorial conference on the 27th of this month to celebrate the victory of Tannenberg. All countries are expecting the speech that leader Hitler will deliver.

According to reliable sources, German troops have received orders to occupy the Polish Corridor starting at noon on the 24th of this month (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)

### Signs of Economic Panic in Japan: Gold Reserves and Raw Material Stockpiles Both Decreasing

Moscow - The Red Star newspaper recently published an article entitled "Signs of Economic Panic in Japan," which reads:

"The Japanese warlords have used inflation and increased taxes to exploit the working masses and actively promote dumping policies in the world market, resulting in the extreme prosperity of their war industry and its affiliated sectors. However, this has resulted in an abnormally unbalanced nature of its entire economic development. On the one hand, industrial production has increased, while on the other hand, agriculture has been extremely backward, and the purchasing power of the people has become weaker. At the same time, although the production of means of production has also made some progress, the production of consumer goods has sharply declined during wartime. Judging from the Japanese statistics, an economic recession in Japan did indeed begin in 1938, and by the end of the same year, the extreme recession had affected the production of means of production.

The reduction of Japan's gold reserves and raw material stockpiles is also one of the important signs of future panic. To date, Japan has used almost two-thirds of its gold reserves, and the remaining gold available to pay foreign countries is only enough for the next year.

The sharp increase in Japan's war spending has gradually exhausted its finances and economy. According to the clearly exaggerated estimates of the Japanese "Oriental Economist" magazine, Japan's total national income in 1939 was only 20 billion yen, while this year's national budget expenditure reached a huge 10 billion yen, of which direct war spending accounted for 7 billion yen. Taxes and other items have increased by 150% this year, reaching 2.5 billion yen in this year's budget. The total amount of domestic public debt was only 4 billion yen a few years ago, but this year it will exceed the total amount of total national income. Furthermore, the total amount of war spending to date has reached 12 billion yen, and thereafter, 500 million yen will be required each month.

The expansion of agricultural panic occupies an extremely important position in the general severity of the economic situation. Currently, 50% of the young men of conscription age have been sent to the front lines, and a large number of farmers have left the countryside to work in arms factories. One-third of the country's horses have been commandeered for war. Agricultural production has sharply declined, so the signs of industrial panic complement those of agriculture.

Japanese imperialists are now striving to further implement the total mobilization of the entire national economy to meet wartime needs. This measure may delay the outbreak of panic, but when the Japanese economy is completely exhausted by the war and panic cannot but break out, its impact will be even more serious." (Moscow Dispatch, 22nd)

### Nehru Arrives in Chongqing; Zhu Jiahua and Others Welcome Him at the Airport with Speeches

Chongqing - Nehru, leader of the Indian National Congress, arrived in Chongqing at 1:24 PM on the 23rd, flying from Yunnan aboard the large Eurasia aircraft "Hami." Those who welcomed him at the airport included Zhu Jiahua, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters; Liu Zhi, Commander of the Chongqing Garrison; Hong Lanyou, Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Party Headquarters; He Guoguang, Mayor; Duan Maolan, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Peng Ge-Chen, representative of the Central Propaganda Department; Chen Mingshu, representative of 123 organizations; and over 500 people, including members of the Sanminzhuyi Youth League and students from the Liangjiang Physical Education College. The scene was unprecedentedly grand and enthusiastic. After the aircraft landed, Jiahua and others immediately stepped forward to exchange greetings. Then, two student representatives from Liangjiang Physical Education College presented ×××. Mr. Nehru, with a smiling face, repeatedly nodded to the welcomers to express his thanks. Subsequently, Chen Mingshu personally presented letters of welcome from various organizations and delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Today, we welcome the leader of the Indian National Congress and Mr. Nehru, who has consistently expressed sympathy and support for our war of resistance and national reconstruction. We feel very excited and happy and hope Mr. Nehru will give us guidance." Mr. Nehru then replied, "Gentlemen, I am overwhelmed by your warm welcome today. The Indian people have always expressed sincere sympathy for your country's war of resistance. Both your country and India are the birthplaces of ancient Eastern culture, having blossomed brilliantly and made significant contributions to human history. Therefore, the connection between our two great nations is not only a current need but also a necessity for future cooperation to jointly promote the spirit of our two nations and bring forth the glory of the past." At this point, applause erupted at the airport, and welcome slogans were shouted. Mr. Nehru then accompanied Zhu Jiahua and others on a tour around the airport to thank the welcoming representatives before taking a small ferry across the river to the shore. (23rd dispatch)

Chongqing - Tonight's event was originally intended as a reception for Nehru, leader of the All-India Congress, who arrived here today from Kunming. However, due to a Japanese air raid, it has been postponed temporarily. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is extremely concerned about Nehru's safety. After the Japanese bombing, he inquired by telephone with those hosting Nehru and learned that Mr. Nehru and other government leaders had taken shelter in Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui's bomb shelter during the Japanese bombing. The Generalissimo is scheduled to host a banquet to welcome Mr. Nehru tomorrow. (23rd Associated Press dispatch)

### Japanese Planes Bomb Chongqing Suburbs; 27 Aircraft Drop Dozens of Bombs; Chinese Planes Ascend to Engage, Japanese Planes Escape

Chongqing - Tonight, 27 Japanese planes dropped dozens of bombs on the refugee reception area in the southwestern suburbs of Chongqing and the residences of residents recently evacuated from the city. The Japanese planes came in two batches, one appearing at 7:30 and the other at 7:45. The number of casualties is expected to be very large because there is a lack of air-raid shelters and bomb shelters here. After the Japanese bombing, three fires broke out, but they were extinguished by the fire brigade within half an hour. The air raid warning was issued at 6:30. Two squadrons of the Chinese Air Force ascended to patrol, but the sky was clear and moonlit, so the Japanese planes were able to find their targets and drop bombs suddenly. After dropping the bombs, the Japanese planes fled northeast. Chinese planes followed closely behind, but there are no reports of any being shot down. Five minutes after the warning was lifted, the shops reopened and business continued as usual. (23rd Associated Press dispatch)

### Zi Lin West Daily Commentary: German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact Should Not Lead to Pessimistic Outlook on Overall Situation; Japan Will Be Completely Abandoned by Its Allies

Germany and the Soviet Union are about to conclude a non-aggression pact. Yesterday, this newspaper's editorial discussed its impact. Now, we translate the comments of the Zi Lin West Daily in this city on this issue for your consideration. Reading it may provide insight into British public opinion. The British are quite calm about this matter, as are the French, as if it were deliberate pretense. However, this is not to be faulted, as when an unexpected blow comes suddenly and a crisis is at hand, the only proper course is to unite, endure pain, and strive to overcome difficulties and turn danger into safety. If, in shock, one creates disturbances or weeps and implores the masses to surrender, it will only dissipate morale, show weakness to the enemy, and provide no benefit to the overall situation. This is what a resolute and courageous nation is unwilling and disdains to do. – Translator

Hitler's obtaining Soviet consent to conclude a non-aggression pact is a significant diplomatic victory, which may have far-reaching implications for the current European situation. However, neither any panic revealed by this, nor the acceptance of a more pessimistic view than before this new development was announced, is justified. The benefits gained by both sides from the agreement are quite clear. At first glance, this move seems to hinder Britain and France, but its final result will certainly not be as harmful to the two countries as initially felt. Because Germany has this agreement, in the event of a European war, the Soviet Union will not be threatened by Germany's activities in the Baltic countries and can maintain its neutrality for a long time. This neutrality can enable Germany to obtain supplies of food and raw materials from neutral countries and give Germany the opportunity to wage a protracted war. From a military point of view, Germany has relieved its concerns about the Soviet Union deploying troops on its eastern front and can deal with the democratic countries of Western Europe with all its strength. From the Soviet Union's point of view, the benefits are equally important. Since Germany is no longer a threat to its western border, it no longer needs to worry about the Far East problem posed by Japan. This invalidates the idea of Japan joining the Rome-Berlin military alliance. This constitutes a severe rejection of Italy's efforts to draw Japan into the alliance. This significantly weakens the strength of the anti-communist bloc. Since one of the most important members of the anti-communist bloc has reconciled with the Soviet Union and signed a non-aggression pact, the position of the remaining two participants is obviously becoming weaker. It is also conceivable that the group of strong nations that Hitler has single-mindedly created may now have sown seeds of division among them in order to meet his own special needs.

In the past, the German military leaders openly insisted on forming an alliance with the Soviet Union, but it did not materialize due to Hitler's own opposition. Now that Hitler has signed this non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, he has made a slight concession to the German military. Although one cannot say that there is any real chance of merging the ideologies of the two countries, a half loaf of non-aggression is better than a military alliance with no bread at all. As for the impact of this significant development on Poland, it is not yet possible to say for sure. However, it should be known that this decision made everything that was always possible before the signing of the military alliance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. In the event of a war over the Polish issue, Britain and France will inevitably fight the Axis powers alone. This is always a possibility. Although this non-aggression pact certainly eliminates the possibility of the Soviet Union forming a military alliance with Britain and France, it has not created a military situation that was not previously anticipated. However, Poland's determination to reject Germany's demands may be seen as weaker than before, but this is not necessarily the case. Because the annexation of Danzig into German territory and the occupation of the Polish Corridor by Germany will obviously economically control Poland's fate. If so, then Poland will no longer be an independent country. Judging from the current mood of the Polish people, they may not be willing to accept this change. If they accept it, it is tantamount to national suicide. Therefore, it would not be surprising if we learned in the coming days that Poland's will to resist has not changed. If Poland decides to take this path, Britain and France will certainly come to its aid. If the Axis powers are concerned, although Germany's position may seem better than before in the initial contact, the war situation will eventually improve. This is undoubtedly beyond doubt. If the general result of the German-Soviet agreement is to strengthen Hitler's hand in the present, then the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis must be weakened and destroy any opportunity for Japan to gain benefits by joining the German-Italian military alliance, and it constitutes a severe rejection of Italy's eagerness to form this union. If Japan cannot hope to receive the assistance of Germany, which is bound by a non-aggression pact, in the event of a Soviet-Japanese war, then Japan will never join this alliance. Therefore, the relations between the three countries that formed the anti-communist bloc can be summarized as follows today: Germany has signed a pact with Italy in its military alliance, clearly stating that if a dispute arises between the Soviet Union and Italy, Italy cannot expect the military assistance of the main member of the German-Italian military alliance. Italy initially wanted Japan to join the military alliance, but now it will see that Germany has no intention of inviting Japan to join this alliance to assist its aggression. Japan may have realized that the situation created by the German-Soviet non-aggression pact has placed it in a decidedly disadvantageous position and recognized that the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis has no value in allowing it to join the German-Italian military alliance. Therefore, the general situation today has caused a perplexed change in the minor members of the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis. If Germany is indeed using its schemes, disregarding its allies, and even disregarding the impact of this development on them, then everything mentioned above seems very correct in light of the recent events. Germany may turn to persuade Italy to also conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. This sounds strange at first hearing, but in the past few years, Italy has followed Germany closely. It is certainly conceivable that Italy will follow Germany's example. If so, what will Japan do? It will be completely abandoned by its allies today, just as it was abandoned by the democratic countries. It is in great danger of becoming isolated. Therefore, in this situation, one should not have a pessimistic outlook on the overall situation, because this does not create a new position, and this is not always possible. If Germany is indeed discarding its two allies, as they say, then its final result may prove to further strengthen the power of the democratic countries.

### Japanese Troops in Chao-Shan Invade Jieyang and Suffer a Defeat; Zhou Zhizhen Offers a Plan to Seize Jieyang and Protect Shantou; Japanese Planes Tragically Bomb Xingning and Fengshun

Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese troops in Chao-Shan are only able to hold the key points along the Chao-Shan Railway. Villages and townships more than three Chinese miles away from the railway are beyond the reach of Japanese forces. Therefore, even though the Japanese troops have occupied Chaoan for two months, they are showing signs of exhaustion. In Shantou City, a puppet organization initially appeared, called the "Local Maintenance Association," with Chen Juemin as the puppet chairman. However, because Chen could not recruit local people to participate, he simply left the puppet Maintenance Association and called himself the Supervisor of Huichaojia, handing the puppet Maintenance Association over to Yang Jixiang to run, receiving a monthly military ticket allowance from the Japanese army to maintain appearances. In July, the Japanese army again pulled out Wu Sujuan, a nurse from the Boai Hospital, to organize the puppet Chao-Shan Women's Great Alliance. Apart from three or so concubines of the rogues who came to the scene, no women participated. Recently, a person named Zhou Zhizhen arrived in Shantou on a mission to form a puppet Peace and National Salvation Revival Army. The Japanese army greatly appreciated him and immediately instigated Zhou to organize a puppet Shantou City United Committee, and also pulled out Zhang Weichen, Zhong Rongguang, and Yue Junan from Chaoan to be puppet committee members, limiting them to prepare for establishment by the 18th of this month, with Zhang Weichen as the puppet Finance Bureau Chief, Zhong Rongguang as the puppet Police Bureau Chief, and Yue Junan as the puppet General Affairs Bureau Chief. Zhou Zhizhen also offered a plan to the Japanese side, saying that if they wanted to protect Chao-Shan, they must first seize Jieyang, and only by consolidating the outer line strongholds could Chao-Shan be stabilized. The Japanese army believed him, so on the 9th, they transferred 500 puppet vanguard team members from Guangzhou, half of whom were from the Northeast, Taiwan, and Korea. The leader of the team, a certain Li, was from Jiaoling, Guangdong, who had been doing business in Taiwan for many years, forgetting his ancestors and not knowing where his blood came from. Starting on the 10th, the Japanese troops in Chaoan City moved out towards Fengxi, invading Anjie Road, with several squadrons of aircraft as the vanguard, bombing and firing at Meigang, Quxi, Xichang, Guanbu, and Fengshan in Jieyang, causing heavy losses to the people. More than 300 Japanese troops marched to the foothills of Fengling Mountain and were intercepted by the Chinese security team. After four hours of bloody fighting, the Japanese troops were defeated and left. The next day, the Japanese troops again transferred 600 Japanese troops from Fuyang and Guanchao to invade Qingmaoshan and Yuntishan on Anjie Road, with cavalry and tank teams as the vanguard. They were also invited to attack by the Chinese army in the mountains. The tanks fell into traps, blocking the way. The fighting continued until sunset, and the Japanese troops collapsed and retreated, returning to Fuyang and Guanchao. They were also cut off by the Chinese guerrillas from Sangpu Mountain at Wuyang Mountain. The Japanese artillery fired hundreds of shells to cover their retreat. On the 12th, the Japanese troops, in view of the threat to the flanks of the siege of Jieyang from the Chinese army on Sangpu Mountain, again transferred 300 troops from Chaoan, together with Japanese troops from Caitang, Guanchao, and Fuyang, with five cannons and more than ten mortars, to enter the mountains along three routes: Jinshishi, Hongan Township, and Shaxi. The foot of Sangpu Mountain, only thirty Chinese miles from the railway line, its mountains parallel to the railway and straddling Anjie Highway, its mountain range is quite majestic. Although the Japanese troops invaded along three routes, they were still defeated by the Chinese guerrillas on the mountain. In the afternoon, the Japanese troops fled to Yunbu City, where they were exhausted and their formations were already disorganized. In summary, in three days of fighting, the Chinese army was able to use the terrain to fight the few against the many, and the Japanese army suffered more than 500 casualties. At this time, the Chinese regular army was still in the rear of Xingning, Fengshun, and Jieyang, waiting for an opportunity for a general counterattack. Therefore, those who clashed with the Japanese army in the past few days were security regiments, guerrillas, and strong men from various villages who ran up the mountains. Their fighting spirit was strong, so they were able to achieve such results. After suffering this disastrous defeat, the Japanese army sent out four planes on the 13th to bomb Xingning, Fengshun, Liuhuang, Tangkeng, and other places. Xingning was hit by fourteen bombs, eight of which fell within the city, destroying seven of the county middle school dormitories, collapsing the local court, and destroying many nearby civilian houses. Two bombs fell on Shanghua Street outside the city, collapsing six shops. Two bombs fell on Xingxui Station, flattening it. Two bombs fell on the civilian hospital, destroying three civilian houses. At 7:00 AM on the 14th, seven Japanese planes flew again to Xingning and Fengshun to drop bombs, flying low over the suburbs of Xingning for 45 minutes, dropping up to 80 bombs, including 12 incendiary bombs. A large fire broke out throughout the city. The civilian houses in the city were reduced to rubble. The Japanese planes then turned to Fengshun and Liuhuang, dropping 15 bombs. Many local people did not have time to escape and suffered hundreds of casualties. When the Japanese planes passed Tangkeng, they also dropped five bombs and then flew overseas. The Japanese army's failure to attack Jieyang actually used planes to take revenge on the people in the rear, which can be described as extremely cruel.

### Finance: European War Clouds Loom, Gold Prices Rise and Fall Wildly; Gold Holders Rush to Liquidate, Low Point Sees 3,965 Yuan

Yesterday, the after-hours trading of spot gold suddenly plummeted, falling by a significant 570 yuan. The opening this morning was driven by electronic transmissions that the situation in Europe was serious, with a possibility of imminent outbreak. Apart from the Hong Kong merchants who absorbed some, many parties panicked and came out in droves, causing prices to plummet. It fell to as low as 4,100 yuan, and remained listless until noon, closing at 4,150 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was weak, followed by the agitation of gold hoarders outside the industry caused by the publication of newspaper extra news. Fearing that gold would be reduced to cheap goods in the event of World War I, they immediately rushed to the market to dump their holdings, causing the price to break through the 4,000 yuan mark and once retreated to a low of 3,790 yuan. Although a certain gold shop took advantage of the low price to pull up the price, the volume of transactions was sparse, and the closing price was only 3,965 yuan. However, it was reported that the potential was suddenly good after the closing, and it returned to 4,050 yuan. The volume of transactions throughout the day was extremely strong, about two to three thousand taels. Silver shop jewelry gold also fell sharply by 60 yuan. Customs gold remained flat, while Sino-British pure gold and others fell slightly.

Spot Gold Plummets 570 Yuan

Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened weak. Coupled with the strong foreign exchange, the buyers were cautious. The market opened 35 yuan lower. Silver shops sold twenty taels to money changers, with the price at 4,500 yuan. Suddenly, news came that the German army had been ordered to prepare to advance into Danzig, and it was also rumored that Britain had begun preliminary mobilization. As a result, foreign exchange became looser and people became more anxious. Many sellers competed to close their positions. Although at that time a certain silver shop (on behalf of Hong Kong merchants) came to absorb, the selling positions were several times higher, causing the price to tend to fall. Soon it plummeted by 150 yuan. Gold shops mutually traded 30 taels at a price of 4,350 yuan. Later, foreign exchange slightly recovered, and Hong Kong merchants continued to absorb, so the market once recovered to 4,410 yuan. Later, it was heard that foreign exchange had loosened again, and the selling wind rose again. Money changers and securities firms became more interested in buying. It fell another 100 yuan. Silver shops sold 30 taels to money changers at 4,310 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop came to recover some, and once again recovered to 4,365 yuan. After 11 o'clock, foreign exchange continued to weaken, so sellers on the front became more eager. Money changers and a certain silver shop rushed to sell. Before long, it fell again by 265 yuan. Silver shops sold ten taels to money changers at a price of 4,100 yuan. Near noon, Yuhao mutually traded 30 taels, recovering to 4,150 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, people became more nervous, buyers were lacking, and money changers and cash shops came to sell, making the market more chaotic. The opening was 30 yuan lower. Money changers sold 30 taels to Linghao at 4,120 yuan. After the opening, retail investors also came out to sell heavily, and securities firms also sold. Before long, it plummeted by 150 yuan. Securities firms sold 20 taels to cash shops at 3,970 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop strongly absorbed more than a hundred taels, once pulling the price up to 4,050 yuan. Afterwards, because non-industry sellers came one after another, and all sold at market price, buyers, in view of such panic, generally watched with their hands tied. Therefore, there was even less maintenance, and it fell again by 260 yuan. Money changers mutually traded ten taels, with a price of 3,790 yuan, which was the low point of the day. After entering, a certain gold shop took advantage of the low price to aggressively enter, and for a time, the sellers looked on indifferently. Although the price rose to the 3,900 yuan mark, buyers did not buy at all. Later, because a certain gold shop continued to buy at the market price, it raised the price by another 95 yuan. A certain gold shop paid the money changers 30 taels at 3,995 yuan. Later, silver shops resumed the selling wind, and the price fell again by 30 yuan. Silver shops sold 30 taels to money changers at 3,965 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell sharply by 570 yuan compared to the previous day. It was reported that a certain money changer outside the market entered 20 taels for the silver shop, with a price of 4,050 yuan. The range throughout the day was 720 yuan. The selling price of cash shops' own brand gold was ten yuan higher than spot gold. The current bid gold was about fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, with few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Also Falls by 60 Yuan

The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael at silver shops was initially 460 yuan at Dahangtong. At 9:35, it was reduced by five yuan. After a moment, it was reduced by another ten yuan. At 10:10, it was reduced by another five yuan. At 11:30, it fell another five yuan. At 11:58, it fell another five yuan. At 12:00, it fell another ten yuan. At 12:10, it returned to five yuan. At 2:15 in the afternoon, it fell another fifteen yuan. At 2:30, it fell another fifteen yuan. At that time, Dahangtong suspended 390 yuan. Later, at 2:45, it returned to five yuan. At 3:15, it returned to another five yuan. As a result, it was reduced by 60 yuan. Dahangtong changed the suspension to 400 yuan, and Xinhangtong was 398 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by about 20 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Reacts Simultaneously: Bulls Rush to Close Positions, Market Continues to Weaken Sharply

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed rates unchanged. In the unofficial Sterling-Dollar market, the initial situation was relatively calm. However, after 9:30 AM, news suddenly arrived via telegram that German troops were about to occupy Poland and were preparing to advance on Danzig. Furthermore, it was reported that Britain had also initiated preliminary mobilization, bringing the European situation to a critical juncture. Consequently, general operators were panicked. Entities like China Bank and East Asia Bank, along with speculators, rushed to unload their positions. Hong Kong telegrams frequently offered to sell, and foreign banks like HSBC had poor absorption capacity, leading to a severe oversupply of funds. The market weakened significantly. At one point, the strongest Sterling rate reached 3 shillings 7.1875 pence, and the lowest Dollar rate saw foreign banks absorbing at 7.25 yuan. Ultimately, Sterling closed at 3 shillings 6.875 pence and the Dollar at 7.1875 yuan. However, the market briefly improved due to foreign firms settling accounts and foreign banks absorbing positions, causing the exchange rate to soften slightly. Ultimately, the abundance of sellers made it unsustainable. The near-term market weakened similarly to the spot market. For September contracts, the market was firmer than the spot market due to an even greater influx of sellers and foreign banks' willingness to absorb being weak. In the end, Sterling weakened by 25 pence, and the Dollar depreciated by half a yuan. Trading volume was still brisk for half the day.

Dollar Rate Reached 7 Yuan

Early morning rates showed London at 875 points higher for near-term large bars and 9375 points higher for forward contracts. New York silver prices also surged by 1.25 points.

Banks opened the spot market with a selling price of 3 and a half shillings for Sterling and 6.8125 yuan for the Dollar, both unchanged from the previous close. After opening, the first Hong Kong telegram offered spot Sterling at 3 shillings 5.3125 pence to foreign banks, showing a slightly firmer trend. After HSBC's listed rates were announced as unchanged and the Silver Equalization Tax was revealed to remain waived, news suddenly arrived via telegram that German troops had been ordered to prepare to occupy Poland and would advance on Danzig. Further reports indicated that Britain had also initiated preliminary mobilization. Additionally, China Bank's Hong Kong branch sent in offers to sell, further hardening the market. China Bank, East Asia Bank, and others sold spot Sterling at 3 shillings 6.25 pence and spot Dollars at 6.9375 and 7.0625 yuan to foreign banks like HSBC. At 10:00 AM, the market briefly rallied due to some foreign firms settling accounts and foreign banks' willingness to absorb improving. Foreign firms bought spot Sterling at 3 shillings 5.9375 pence and spot Dollars at 7 yuan from foreign banks. Subsequently, a flood of sell orders came from Hong Kong via telegram, and Chinese merchants rushed to close their positions, causing the situation to weaken again. Hong Kong telegrams sold spot Sterling at 3 shillings 6.25 pence to foreign banks. Following this, Chinese merchants sold September Sterling at 3 shillings 4.0625 pence to a certain bank and offered September Dollars at 6.625 yuan to E Lee Bank. At the time, foreign banks showed no appetite for current month Dollars at 7.125 yuan. Later in the day, banks bought spot Sterling at 3 shillings 6.5625 pence and spot Dollars at 7.125 yuan from foreign banks. Near noon, China Bank sold spot Sterling at 3 shillings 6.875 pence and spot Dollars at 7.1875 yuan to foreign banks. Following this, Chinese merchants sold spot Dollars to a certain bank, hardening the rate to 7.25 yuan. Simultaneously, foreign banks bid for Sterling at 3 shillings 7.1875 pence. At noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 3 shillings 6.875 pence for Sterling and 7.1875 yuan for the Dollar. Current month rates were 3 shillings 6.71875 pence for Sterling and 7.15625 yuan for the Dollar. September rates were 3 shillings 4.375 pence for Sterling and 6.6875 yuan for the Dollar. The results showed a weakening of 1875 pence for spot and current month Sterling and a hardening of 375 for the Dollar compared to the previous day. September Sterling weakened by 25 pence, and the Dollar hardened by half a yuan. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

### Securities: Stimulated by Domestic Bonds, Category A Rushes Past 50 Yuan, Far East Stocks Continue to Fall

The securities gray market saw trading yesterday stimulated by the increasingly close relations between Germany and the Soviet Union, which visibly altered the global landscape. Public bonds were strongly stimulated by this positive news and rose sharply. Because of the large number of short positions, covering was very active. Rumors started circulating after closing, causing a further rise of about half a yuan, followed by a retreat. Amidst such dramatic changes, the market price will inevitably experience more substantial fluctuations, swinging high and low. Yesterday, the market opened with a sharp rise of about one yuan. Ding Kang, Da Tong, De Fu, Heng Fu, Run Li, and No. 5, No. 42 were all bought, but in limited quantities. Song Mao, Lian Yi, Hong Da, Yong Kang, and others were mostly sold.

Foreign Currencies Plunge Directly: English and American Gold Pounds Fall by 100 Yuan; The First Sharp Drop After a High Rise

Hong Kong drafts and French Francs also saw significant declines. Singapore drafts and Dutch drafts saw little demand, and the market was very weak. The Japanese gold draft was 1.15 yuan in the evening market, and the Korean draft was 99 cents in the evening market, both declining. Yesterday's market prices saw the English gold pound fall by 14.5 yuan, the English gold draft fall by 5 yuan, the American gold pound fall by 15.5 yuan, the American gold draft fall by 1.35 yuan, the Hong Kong draft fall by 45 cents, the French Franc fall by 2.5 cents, the Singapore draft fall by 50 cents, the Dutch draft fall by 70 cents, Annam drafts and Roby drafts all fall by 30 cents, the Canadian draft fall by 1.3 yuan, the Philippine draft fall by 70 cents, the Australian gold draft fall by 4 yuan, and the Siamese draft fall by 60 cents. Only the German gold draft and Italian draft remained unchanged.

### Yarn Bulls Flee in Large Numbers: Double Horse Yarn Plummets 70 Yuan, Others Fall 40-50 Yuan

The yarn market opened fairly stable, with a slight weakness. Then, with the official announcement of the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany, opinions in the market diverged, and no consensus was reached. It was said to be beneficial to China. As a result, the market fluctuated, and sentiment turned optimistic. Bulls, seeing the changing international situation, became bearish on all commodities. Consequently, large quantities were offered for sale en masse. The supply of chips became abundant. Buyers, seeing the overwhelming trend, had the intention of maintaining support, but the environment was such that they lacked the courage to do so. In fact, successive days of price hikes had been excessive. Although demand from Hong Kong continued, market sources said that transactions involving gains and losses for Guangbang merchants accounted for more than 50%. Therefore, once the reaction suddenly appeared, it was unrecoverable, like a dam breaking. The 20s Double Horse yarn ticket suffered the most drastic drop, falling 70 yuan compared to the previous day. The spot price also fell. The opening price was 750 yuan, but it fell to a closing price of 700 yuan, driven by negative news, a sharp drop of 64 yuan compared to the previous day. Other yarns also fell by 40-50 yuan. This situation made everyone pale in fear. Half-day transaction statistics totaled 855 bales. A breakdown of the quantities purchased by each trade group is listed below:

Afternoon news reported a conflict between Germany and Poland. Gold prices plummeted, and sentiment became even more fearful. Sellers were eager to sell, while buyers shrank back in fear and dared not try.

### Yarn Prices Plummet, Cotton Mills Turn Quiet; However, Raw Cotton is a Wartime Necessity: All Parties Firmly Believe Prices Will Only Rise, Not Fall

Transactions in raw cotton were scarce. Chinese cotton completely entered a standstill. Only Indian cotton saw some transactions, but in very small quantities, and all transactions were agreed upon in the morning. The international situation changed, and yarn prices plummeted by a massive 60-70 yuan. As a result, raw cotton, which is interdependent with yarn, was inevitably drawn into the vortex. According to market sources, cotton prices rose by more than 10 yuan per picul compared to the previous day. Mills, seeing the severity of the situation, had no intention of procuring. Deliveries of Subu cotton bales had not arrived. A record of sales conditions is listed below:

Another dispatch reported that trade in foreign cotton in Shanghai was very beneficial to China's war of resistance because of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, which caused extraordinary excitement. However, speculators closed positions to take profits on the belief that the future European situation would not allow pure gold to be reported, resulting in a longer exchange rate for US dollars that once reached 7.25 yuan. Everyone believed that this was only a temporary result of market fluctuations, and that a conversion of raw cotton prices could reduce 45 yuan per dan. Colleagues are convinced that the long exchange rate is a temporary floating settlement. In the future, if the European war becomes the development phase, then China's overseas transport, all countries have no time to take into account, then Sino-foreign transport will be interrupted. Moreover, raw cotton is a wartime necessity, so all parties are confident that the price of cotton will only rise, not fall. The market has been spreading the news that the Customs Gold conversion rate will change, which is beneficial to the rise in cotton prices.

The foreign cotton market has been quiet for many days in New York, but yesterday, due to the news of the tense European situation, the cotton market was very active. Colleagues are strongly buying in the market. Raw cotton is a military raw material, and due to the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, the European political situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, and all countries are making extraordinary preparations, so overseas cotton merchants are purchasing American cotton very enthusiastically, so the closing price rose by more than ten pounds compared to the previous day. India, because of its slightly different situation, is expected to rise by another 2 rupees and a half, and Egypt is expected to rise by more than ten pounds.

### Grains: Rice Unchanged, Shops Actively Transact, Afternoon Improves, Over 2,000 More Bales of New Hsien Arrive

Du Geng: Over 2,000 bales of cartwheel-wrapped rice arrived. After the overall market rebounded briefly yesterday, the opening hand was weaker yesterday, and the market declined. However, by noon, with sparse arrivals, shops on the street suddenly became active, and the market rose again in an instant, resulting in a fixed situation. Gao Xi Geng opened at 39 yuan, fresh Changzhou Geng at 39 yuan, Kunshan Su and Tong trades at 37.6 to 38 yuan, Hexia early and late rice at 34 to 35 yuan, original wrapped rice at 37 to 38 yuan, Gao Chen Tip at 35 to 36 yuan, new Tip at 33 to 34 yuan, Bian Yuan at 30 to 31 yuan. The total transaction volume was just over 7,000 bales.

Ke Hsien: Yesterday morning, due to the arrival of new Hsien from all routes, the market seemed to be leveling off. Then, shops and storage facilities took advantage of small-scale absorption, and the market tightened again. As a result, it was still larger than the previous market by about half a yuan. Chen Hsien from Wuhu still required 35 or 6 yuan, new Hsien at 32.5 yuan, newly arrived Taizhou new Hsien opened at 34 yuan, and Jiangbei new Hsien at 35 yuan. Over 2,000 bales of new Hsien from all routes arrived.

Foreign Rice: No bulk deals were finalized. Sellers remained opportunistic. New Saigon initially opened at 43 yuan, then increased by 2 yuan to 45 yuan.

### Flour Sales Broaden Daily, Wheat Prices Loosen

Flour: Sales of existing flour have been increasing daily since rice prices soared. Yesterday, rice shops that also retailed flour were asking factories to supply as much as possible. In order to maintain the food supply, factories did not limit supply, but required direct delivery to prevent hoarding and profiteering. Total market transactions increased sharply to over 40,000 bales. The No. 2 flour factory traded at 6.4 yuan in cash. Returns of goods became increasingly chaotic, and selling prices rose to 6.67 yuan.

Wheat: The wheat market had slightly rebounded yesterday, as the sudden financial upheaval caused general hoarders to become stagnant, dulling the market. Prices gradually loosened. In total, the Fu and Fu factories handled over 10,000 bales. Prices showed little change. Hoarders only took in one cartload of Taicang wheat, at a price of 9.95 yuan.

### Oil Market, Gold Prices Fall: Soybean Oil Plummets Sharply, Down 5-6 Yuan From Highest Price

Yesterday, the oil market saw a value for the value of the legal tender with an international situation, coupled with the tension in Europe, and prices plummeting, the people's hearts standing still. Speculators were dealt a blow, and hoarders tried to flee, resulting in a sharp drop in the afternoon, plunging 5 or 6 yuan from the highest price of the day. A total of 100 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were traded, with prices opening at 58 yuan, then falling frequently to 54 yuan. Also, 300 barrels of Kobe-Dalian oil arrived, with prices plunging straight from 59 yuan to 55 yuan, along with 50 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil at prices ranging from 56.5 yuan to 54 yuan.

### Piece Goods Hoarders Desperately Unload: Cloth Market Cannot Withstand the Pressure

Domestic Cloth

The European situation is turbulent, and the hearts of the people in this city are uneasy. A portion of the hoarders are eager to sell, and the market suddenly loosens. Da Peng Fugui paper cloth falls 25 cents per piece. The remaining fine cloth and fine twill also fall 30 cents. Light and heavy coarse cloth falls 10 to 20 cents. Bleached and dyed cloth and woolen fabrics fall 30 to 50 cents per piece. Market prices vary. However, factories and colleagues mostly maintain their original positions. Sales on the street drop sharply, and customer sales also decrease. Singapore, Siam, and Bengal, among other foreign locations, handle 3,000 pieces of bleached cloth, printed poplin, and dyed drill. The Sichuan and Yunnan trades handle over 3,000 pieces of dyed cloth, printed satin, pongee, and mousseline. The Ningbo trade handles 60 packages of Yihe and Dasheng coarse cloth. The Shandong trade handles over 40 packages of New Yu 16-pound Earth brand coarse cloth.

East Piece

The market atmosphere is weak, and white and colored goods alike are falling. White fine cloth plummets 30 to 75 cents per piece. 12-pound Five Blessings fine cloth falls from 16.75 yuan to 16 yuan. The decline in fine twill is slower, falling 10 to 20 cents per piece. Dong cotton stores take in over one hundred packages of Longtou fine cloth spot goods, with a settlement price of 18 yuan per piece. However, there are only a few customer transactions. The street market is also only sparsely decorated, and the trend is particularly stagnant.

Exports

23rd of this month: 30 pieces shipped to Xiamen, 20 pieces to Hong Kong, 42 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 2 pieces to Haikou.

### Sugar Market: Slab Blue Soars

With market stocks dwindling, domestic sugar is frequently rising. Yesterday's listed prices continued to rise. Shantou cotton white and above ice opened at 54 yuan, numbering dozens of packages. Huanggang green 96 packages reached 40 yuan. Over one hundred pieces of Jizhuang slab blue opened at 32 yuan, an unprecedented high price. Newly arrived white package Hainan red lined goods cleared 31 yuan, and oil package goods opened at 26 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Drops Sharply

Yesterday's silk market saw a sharp drop due to the extended exchange rate. White factory grade 7/8 sold for 3925 yuan, a drop of about 80 yuan. Foreign firms' buying prices had already fallen within the 3800 yuan range, so the silk market in recent days may encounter setbacks.

Yesterday, foreign silk markets saw a slight rebound. New York spot prices rose by 2.5 cents, and forward contracts rose by 2.5 cents. Yokohama spot prices rose by 5 yuan, and forward contracts rose by 8 yuan. However, these gains did not provide any support to the Shanghai silk market due to foreign exchange fluctuations.

### Seafood: Kylin Vegetables Stock Will Soon be Depleted

The stock of kylin vegetables here is thin. Having been sold off successively, it is about to be depleted. And new supply cannot keep up. The market has risen by more than ten yuan. Lion's mane vegetables sell for 40 yuan, while Ceylon and dragon teeth sell for 38 yuan.

### Metals: Selling Prices Chaotic

Yesterday afternoon, reliable sources reported that German troops would invade the Polish Corridor before noon today, causing the European situation to suddenly become tense. The Shanghai market also changed accordingly. The market was chaotic for a time, and the five metal products were greatly affected. Opening prices fluctuated sharply, with no standard price to speak of. An excerpt of the public meeting price and colleagues' selling plates are reproduced below for reference as needed.

New steel plate 5 cents 40, American white iron 37 feet 600
Also 2 and a half cents 500, Another 37 feet 500

### After International Situation Changes, Chinese Finance Becomes More Advantageous; Japanese Finance Suffers Considerable Impact; The Future of Eurasian Commerce Will Change

Since foreign dispatches reported the signing of a business credit agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany, followed by news that the German Foreign Minister would fly to the Soviet Union to negotiate the conclusion of a Soviet-German non-aggression pact, the international situation suddenly changed. Domestic and foreign financial, economic, and market conditions were stimulated by this news, and sentiment was shaken. Chinese financial circles generally predict that the Soviet Union's future policy towards the Far East will become more active, so the basis of legal tender will inevitably become more solid, and foreign exchange will become more stable. Japanese currency, due to the extent of the impact on the anti-communist agreement within the country, is viewed with suspicion and its labor will be weaker. The impact on the future of commercial finance in the Far East is significant. Here is a record of public sentiment:

Beneficial to China: Early Signs

According to the observations of financial figures familiar with the international situation, given the current state of the European situation, Britain and France are deeply concerned about the Danzig problem. To contain the issue, they hesitate. At this time, Soviet-German relations suddenly undergo a change. Apart from observing developments, Britain and France, due to their still relatively good relationship with the Soviet Union, though suffering an unexpected setback, are unlikely to see any weakening in their position and national power. However, the general Shanghai market believes that Germany, after signing an agreement, will attempt to seize Danzig, and the future of Europe is unpredictable. Therefore, they believe that the source of German goods may not be as smooth as before, and they generally hold a view of calm observation, in order to sell at a good price. However, this observation is not shared by those in the know. Observers believe that Germany may still use the momentum of signing an agreement as a method of seeking to seize Danzig. As for the Soviet Union, it can at least obtain the opportunity to freely deal with the Far East. Therefore, their view is that the impact on Europe is not as close and immediate as the impact on the Far East. In general, the news of this being beneficial to the Chinese economy and finance can be said to be a direct and good result.

Japanese Finance: Considerable Impact

On the Japanese side, regarding the recent changes in Soviet-German relations, there is outward calm, but market sentiment is becoming troubled. Yesterday, financial figures received news that the prices of various Japanese stocks are weakening. The exchange rate between the Japanese yen and legal tender in China continued to decline yesterday (at 1.18 yuan). Japan's trade with the Soviet Union, which was already minuscule, will be further impacted by the signing of this Soviet-German business agreement. Japan's trade with Germany will also be affected by the impact of Soviet goods entering Germany. In addition, the US-Japan trade agreement and the US announcement of the termination date means that Japan's commercial and economic situation will enter an even more difficult situation. It is generally predicted that Japan's finance will be subject to considerable impact.

Shanghai Finance: Generally Improved

Due to the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, the Shanghai financial market has generally improved, resulting in the black market foreign exchange continuing to weaken, the black market gold price plummeting, and the securities gray market and unified bonds soaring. However, China's legal tender is now becoming more stable. Although the amount of legal tender issued has increased compared to before the war, cash reserves are above 40%, ranking first among cash reserves in European and American countries. After foreign exchange has been stabilized by the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, the central bank's official exchange rate has always been stable, and legitimate needs for all industries are still being supplied as much as possible.

Gold Plummets: Public Bonds Soar

Yesterday, a New Voice News Agency reporter learned the following from the financial market: (1) The black market foreign exchange, as listed by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, remained unchanged. However, the actual market rates weakened, with English exchange at 3 shillings 65/100 points and the US exchange at 7 yuan. (2) The black market for gold plummeted yesterday morning, with the morning market at 4,150 yuan and the afternoon closing at 3,965 yuan. (3) The securities gray market soared yesterday morning, with Category A unified closing at 50 yuan and 30 cents, up 1.5 yuan; Category B closing at 44 yuan and 20 cents, up 1.05 yuan; Category C closing at 41 yuan and 90 cents, up 1.35 yuan; Category D closing at 40 yuan and 8 cents, up 1.3 yuan; and Category E closing at 41 yuan and 45 cents, up 1.4 yuan. (4) Discount on remittances yesterday morning was 185 yuan, down 10 yuan from the previous day.

### The False "City Government" Attempts to Take Over the Court; The Municipal Council Has Refused; The Court is Based on an Agreement Signed by Various Countries; Any Issues Should Be Discussed with the Respective Countries

Chuan Xiao'an, the "Mayor of Shanghai," has long desired to interfere with the First and Second District Courts of the International Settlement and has repeatedly decided to request the Public Concession authorities and the French Consul General in Shanghai to "take over." It is now learned that Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has responded based on the provisions of the First Special District Court Agreement, stating that any issues related to the First Special District Court should be discussed with the signatory countries. The general meaning of the Municipal Council's reply is approximately as follows: "Your Municipal Government's letter of August 12, 1939, has been received by this Council. Upon investigation, the First Special District Court is established by an agreement signed by representatives of the Chinese government and the governments of Brazil, the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, the Netherlands, and France. This Council is not a signatory to this agreement. Therefore, any issues related to the First Special District Court should be addressed to the respective signatory countries."

### Guerrilla Forces in the Suburbs of Shanghai; The Japanese Claim There are 5,000; A Train of Japanese Soldiers Derailed in the Changzhou Incident; Jinshanwei Wanmen Was Once Recaptured

The French-language Shanghai Daily reported on the 23rd that a pedestrian had encountered more than 50 guerrillas in the Hongqiao area the previous week. On the previous Sunday, the Japanese garrison in Shanghai dispatched more than a dozen tanks to the Qingpu area. According to a declaration by the Japanese authorities yesterday, there are currently over 5,000 guerrillas in the vicinity of Shanghai. The Japanese army is about to begin "suppression." Yesterday, it was heard that some villagers transporting rice to Shanghai for self-sufficiency had been intercepted by guerrillas. Due to the difficulty of inland transportation, villagers mostly transported it in batches of two dan by bicycle to Shanghai. Since yesterday morning, the long lines of rice-carrying bicycles that were commonly seen on Hongqiao Road have suddenly disappeared. For this reason, it is becoming increasingly impossible for inland rice to come to Shanghai. Regarding the interruption of the Shanghai-Nanjing railway, it is said that it was also caused by the activities of guerrillas. According to a passenger who came to Shanghai, the incident occurred in Changzhou. After the tracks were destroyed, a train of soldiers derailed, with as many as eight carriages destroyed. Therefore, those who left Nanjing on Sunday (the 21st) had to wait until noon yesterday (the 22nd) to reach Shanghai. Furthermore, according to people from Jiaxing, Chinese guerrilla forces have been extremely active along the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway in the past week. Every night, Japanese military trains constantly travel along the road, extremely busy.

Only about 300 Japanese soldiers are stationed in Jiaxing city. Therefore, the city gates are tightly closed at night, and they dare not step beyond the boundaries. It is reported that the regular Chinese troops who have been crossing the Qiantang River from the south bank in recent days are now advancing towards the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway area. Fierce battles broke out in the Jinshanwei area on the night of the 20th. A part of the Chinese army besieged the west gate of Jinshanwei, while the main force fiercely attacked the east gate and recaptured Wanmen. The Japanese army was unable to resist and retreated to the west gate. The Chinese side achieved great results in this battle.

### Promoting National Construction Savings; Banks and Post Offices Begin Accepting Deposits; Various Regions Ordered to Actively Promote the Program

A telegram from the Central Social Department states: "The promotion of thrifty National Construction Savings is one of the social movements promoted by party departments in various regions. This Department has repeatedly sent documents to party departments in various regions to report on the progress of the program. Many have already submitted special reports, but many have not reported the actual progress of the program to this Department. This Department has repeatedly written to the Ministry of Finance requesting that it instruct banks in various regions to accept savings, and has also requested that the Ministry of Communications instruct postal savings bureaus in various regions to do the same. We have now received a reply dated June 10 stating that various banks and bureaus can begin accepting deposits in the near future, etc. Therefore, there should be no obstacles to this program. We hope that you will make every effort to promote it actively. The more savings accounts and the larger the amount of savings, the more it will demonstrate the virtues of thrift and patriotism of our people, which is of great importance. You must report the latest progress to this Department for record as soon as possible."

### The Wusong to Qiujiang Wharf Section Was Closed This Morning; It is Said to Be Due to the Handling of Explosives; Japanese Warships Are Now Gathering at the Mouth of the Song River

According to a notice from the Japanese side, the navigation of ships from Wusong to the Qiujiang Wharf was suspended for one hour from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM yesterday. According to reports, this was due to the handling of explosives in that area. It is also reported that a large number of Japanese warships and three cruisers are currently gathering in the Huangpu River.

### Hurricanes Continue in Guam; There is Also a High Tide

The weather in this port has been extremely sultry recently, and the situation of sleeping outdoors in the alleys has not changed. Furthermore, it has been found that there will be another high tide in the Huangpu River from the 29th of this month, with levels between ten and twelve feet. At that time, low-lying roads will still be flooded. A hurricane has also arisen near Guam in the Pacific Ocean and is now moving northwest-west. The area around Luzon Island has already been affected by the wind and is experiencing low pressure. It is difficult to predict whether this port will be threatened, as it is still far from Shanghai.

### The Post Office Finds it Difficult to Redeem Token Postage Stamps at Face Value; The Post Office Did Not Initially Approve or Disapprove of Token Postage Stamps; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits a Petition to the Executive Yuan to Discuss Redemption Methods

Regarding the handling of the problem of postage stamps temporarily used as small change in this city, after the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Postal Administration, it has now received a reply from the Administration stating that it is difficult to redeem these postage stamps for cash. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications to seek solutions to avoid burdening the toiling masses. Various sectors are eagerly awaiting the issuance of small denomination banknotes. The details are recorded as follows:

Redemption at Face Value is Difficult

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday, stating: "Your letter regarding the handling of the two methods for dealing with the postage stamps temporarily used as small change in this city has been received. After careful consideration by this Administration, we hereby reply in separate articles as follows: (1) Because various places in the interior often pay for goods with postage stamps to various bookstores and small shops in this port, the majority of these postage stamps used as tokens are not purchased from this Administration, but are purchased cheaply from these bookstores and small shops. (2) As far as this Administration knows, many of these postage stamps have been used and washed. This Administration, in accordance with postal regulations, may sue those who engage in the crime of washing postage stamps and prosecute them according to criminal law. Most of these washed postage stamps are in the hands of vendors. (3) According to Article 135 of the Postal Regulations, except for holding postage stamps that have been officially abolished, which may be exchanged for new stamps at postal offices within a prescribed period, all kinds of postage stamps, once sold, will not be redeemed by the post office at face value, nor may they be exchanged for other kinds of items. (4) The Post Office neither approves nor disapproves of postage stamps being used as subsidiary currency. However, what should be noted is that postage stamps are not used as subsidiary currency. (5) According to the current situation, if these small-value postage stamps are not too dirty and have not been washed after use, the Post Office can accept them for payment of postage. (6) It is difficult to redeem these postage stamps for cash. In short, this Administration is happy to carefully review all conditions and provide as much assistance as possible within its capabilities. In addition to instructing the staff of this Administration to comply, this letter is sent in response for your information."

Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits a Petition to the Executive Yuan for Remediation

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Communications in Chongqing yesterday, stating: "Since the disappearance of copper subsidiary currency and old copper cash in Shanghai, there has been a lack of small change in the market, causing disturbances. At that time, opinions were divided, with some advocating that stores issue small change coupons or token coupons themselves. Given the complex situation in this city, with numerous stores, if each store issued its own coupons, there would inevitably be thousands of varieties of disguised subsidiary currency coupons in the market, the obstruction of the national currency system of which goes without saying. Fortunately, some in various sectors advocated the use of postage stamps as substitutes. This theory was unanimously agreed upon, both respecting the national system and resolving the disturbances. At a time when government orders could not reach everywhere, such reasonable actions by the people should be praised by the state. However, postage stamps used as small change pass through many hands and are inevitably soiled. If stored in large quantities, they cannot be exchanged for one or five yuan legal tender like subsidiary currency coupons. The uses are narrow, and the stores and vendors engaged in small transactions, as well as the rickshaw pullers and workers with small incomes, receive more and find it difficult to dispose of them. For stores and vendors, they cannot be used as funds for purchasing goods. Therefore, after the stock is sold out, the accumulation of a large number of postage stamps will cause the funds to be stranded and unable to continue operations. For rickshaw pullers and workers, whose income is calculated on a daily basis, the postage stamps they earn in a day often cannot be disposed of for several days, remaining idle at home, which is tantamount to reducing their income. At a time when prices in this city have reached the highest record since the opening of the port, they directly feel double the pressure. The tragic situation is beyond ordinary imagination. Recently, the Central Bank's one-cent and five-cent subsidiary banknotes are about to be issued. How to deal with these accumulated postage stamps has become an urgent problem to be solved. In addition to 'small-value postage stamps that are not too soiled' being allowed to be used to pay postage according to the Shanghai Postal Administration's reply No. 2617, which was approved by the affiliated association, which can eliminate a part of them, those in the hands of small vendors or rickshaw pullers and workers, given the living conditions of these people, would definitely not have many letters to send in a year to offset postage. Long-term stagnation will turn them into waste. When the toiling masses cannot plan for the next day, how can they bear this loss? The central government has compassion for the people's suffering and does not neglect those in distant places. For the toiling masses who have been burdened to maintain the national currency system, we should plan a solution to remedy the situation. We propose that a redemption method be negotiated, a responsible institution be designated, and orders be telegraphed for implementation, without any expectation of waiting for orders. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows, yàng."

Various Sectors Eagerly Await the Prompt Issuance of Small Denomination Banknotes

Since the Central Bank's small denomination banknotes were temporarily postponed for issuance, there is no definite date for their official issuance. However, there are still cases of refusing to use postage stamps in the market, resulting in repeated disputes and increased difficulties. Although some cigarette shops have recently suddenly taken out the copper coins that were previously hidden, the number is limited after all, and there are many difficulties in finding change. The token coupons prepared by various stores for redemption are still being used in the market because the issuance of small denomination banknotes has been postponed, and they are welcomed by the citizens. Small stores and vendors see token coupons as being less prone to soiling and rejection than postage stamps. In recent days, disputes over refusing to use postage stamps in vegetable markets and on public transportation have been almost constant. All sectors are eagerly hoping that small denomination banknotes can be issued as soon as possible to facilitate turnover and alleviate commercial difficulties.

### The False Police Publicly Patrol in Teams on Roads Outside the Settlement; A Japanese Military Spokesman Made This Report; But the Police Deny It

The North China Daily News reported that a Japanese military spokesman claimed at a press conference yesterday (the 22nd) that another incident occurred yesterday between a patrol team of the Public Concession Police and a team of "Great Way Police," involving three British and three Chinese officers from the Police Department, as well as seventeen "Great Way" policemen. The incident occurred when "the Municipal Government police team was proceeding along Route Dufour, near the location of the incident involving Probationary Western Detective Sergeant Kinlock on Saturday, and was stopped by Armored Car No. 1 manned by three Britons and three Chinese. One of the Britons told 'Municipal Government' police Captain Yao that the police force belonged to a part of the Public Concession and that the 'Municipal Government' team had no right to use it. Yao replied that the road did not belong to the Municipal Council and that they were acting on orders from their superiors. If the Public Concession police had any objections, they could negotiate the matter with their superiors." The spokesman continued, "Although the Public Concession police took a threatening attitude and even prepared machine guns, the 'Municipal Government' police did not encounter further disputes and passed through." The spokesman replied to inquiries that if the incident on Saturday could not be blamed on the "Municipal Government" police, they would continue to perform their routine duties. According to the "Municipal Government's" view, its police have the right to patrol on roads outside the settlement. Last night, the Jing'an Temple Police claimed that they were aware of this incident, which was fabricated at the Japanese press conference, but they denied that it had occurred.

### The Glass Manufacturing Industry is in Poor Condition; Maintaining the Livelihood of Workers; Continuing to Work with Painful Endurance

The Shanghai Glass Manufacturing Industry Association held its 17th joint meeting of directors and supervisors the day before yesterday (the 22nd). In addition to discussing the proposals, the speeches of the attendees revealed the increasing prices of raw materials used in the industry and the difficulties of maintaining the livelihood of workers, and the extremely distressed situation of the industry. A summary is described as follows: (1) The consumption of fuel is extremely high in the glass manufacturing process. The price of fuel, which used to be 15 or 16 yuan per ton, is now about 90 yuan. The price of diesel, which used to be 45 yuan per ton, is now 220 yuan. The price of raw materials, such as pure alkali, which used to be more than one yuan per bag, is now 28 yuan. The price of white sand, which used to be 15 yuan per ton, is now also 28 yuan. The price of sodium nitrate, which used to be 23 yuan per bag, is now 70 yuan. The prices of other miscellaneous raw materials have increased by several percent to one or two times. Among them, fluorite, the main raw material for manufacturing milky white glassware, has increased from more than 20 yuan per ton to about 300 yuan due to the ban on exports from the place of origin, and there is a market without goods. (2) Furthermore, it was said that if the stock of raw materials in the factories of the same industry is sufficient, it is still difficult to maintain costs even if the price of their products increases. It would be better to stop work and sell the raw materials, which can still guarantee a stable profit. However, there are no fewer than 3,000 workers in all the glass factories in this city. If they lose their jobs and their families lose their livelihood, how can they bear it? Therefore, they continue to work with painful endurance. Most of the workers in the glass factory are provided with food and lodging by the factory. Amidst the continuous rise in rice prices, the factory is feeling increasingly overwhelmed. In conclusion, the industry believes that because of years of interaction with customers, it strives to maintain the principle of low prices and high quality for its products and hopes that customers can understand this.

### Japanese Warships Leaving Shanghai

The Japanese naval cruisers Yakumo and Iwate arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 20th of this month. The Iwate was moored at buoys No. 1 and 2 on the Lujiazui waterfront (formerly Italian naval buoys), and the Yakumo was moored at the Mitsubishi Wharf north of the Garden Bridge (the former location of the Izumo). The style of the two ships is the same as that of the Izumo. It is reported that the two ships left Shanghai in the morning and afternoon of yesterday, and their destination is unknown.

### Discussing the Western Shanghai Incident; The Japanese Continue to Hold Special Meetings; Scheduled to Discuss Tomorrow on the Izumo; The Japanese Army and Navy肆意Arbitrarily Criticize the Settlement

Regarding the case of the "Great Way Police" shooting the Western Detective Sergeant Kinlock of the Municipal Council Police Department on Route Dufour on the afternoon of the 19th, the Japanese Consul General and the Army and Navy authorities held a meeting on the "Izumo" at 1:00 PM the day after the incident (the 20th) to discuss countermeasures. It is now learned that the commander of the Japanese Central China Army has scheduled to continue discussions with the Shanghai garrison authorities at 5:00 PM on the 25th of this month based on the conclusions of the discussions on the "Izumo" on the 20th. It is said that those attending at that time will be Major General Suzuki, Colonel Kōhei, and Colonel Tanihagi from the Central China Army side, and Major General Sakurai, Major General Takeshita, and Colonel Mabuchi, the garrison commander in Shanghai, from the Japanese garrison side. It is also stipulated that a special meeting will continue to be held at 8:00 PM that afternoon. According to foreign reports, the commander of the Japanese Central China Army arrived in Shanghai yesterday.

Joint Proclamation by the Japanese Army and Navy

The North China Daily News reported that the Japanese Army and Navy authorities issued a joint proclamation last night (the 22nd), stating that the Japanese army had issued a joint proclamation some time ago, which was distributed both domestically and abroad, announcing support for the "Reformed Government" and allowing it to be the "Shanghai Special City Government" and to cooperate with it. However, incidents against the "Shanghai City Government" police have occurred on public roads. This is evidence that the British, who control the Municipal Council, do not recognize the reality. Today, the Japanese army has occupied the areas around Shanghai, and the Public Concession authorities should eliminate those who disturb peace and order in the Public Concession and cooperate with the Japanese army in all aspects. Therefore, the existing Chinese government agencies in the Public Concession should be managed by the Japanese army and the government led by the Japanese army. Regarding the above-mentioned unfortunate incident, from the Japanese army's point of view, it is very serious. The Japanese army is determined to take effective and appropriate measures to eliminate the root cause of this incident.

The Settlement Strengthens Western Shanghai's Defense

Since the incident in which the false police shot the Western patrol officer across the border in Caojiadu, Western Shanghai, the Public Concession Police Department and the Gordon Road, Pruth Road, and Jing'an Temple police stations have strengthened their defenses in Western Shanghai and are working hard to conduct searches along the way. Italian and American defense forces are dispatched to assist at any time. Yesterday, there were rumors outside that the Zhaofeng Park had been prevented by the Public Concession authorities from allowing tourists to enter, etc. The reporter of Daguan News Agency inquired about this matter at the park and learned that it was purely untrue. Because there had been a murder case in the park a few days ago, and the situation in the cross-border section has become serious recently, the police authorities have dispatched more detectives to strengthen their defenses in the nearby area and increased the number of gatekeepers, but the number of tourists has not decreased as a result.

### Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Suggestion: Group Order of Foreign Rice to Oversupply the Market and Lower Rice Prices, Then Keep the Cheap Rice for the Poor to Eat; Negotiations for Transporting Rice May Be Resolved Soon

Important responsible personnel of various Shanghai groups, at 2 PM yesterday, met to discuss ways to maintain the food supply in Shanghai. They decided to order a large quantity of foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai for relief. Companies, factories, shops, and firms, if they need to order rice, should first register with the group. Detailed measures will be announced after a decision is made. Mr. Yu Qiaqing is working hard to raise funds for the advance payment for the foreign rice order, and is in contact with various banks to provide advance payment. It is said that an agreement in principle has been reached with the banking community, and specific details are under negotiation.

Mr. Yu's Suggestion: Order Foreign Rice

Mr. Yu's suggestion to various important groups stated: "The recent surge in rice prices is unprecedented in history. People in the city are running around warning that rice prices have reached 40 yuan. People are panicked and cannot live in peace. Is it because of a poor harvest and crop failure? No. Is it because someone is hoarding and speculating? It seems so, but it is not. Where is the reason? Simply put, it is due to the time between harvests, insufficient reserves, obstructed transportation, and scarce sources. Judging from the current situation and anticipating the future, rice prices of 50 or 60 yuan are also expected. If we do not quickly develop good strategies, the consequences will be unimaginable. The weak will starve to death, the strong will resort to desperate measures, and bandits will rise up like swarms of bees, covering the land. How can the wealthy protect themselves? What is the solution? Temporarily order foreign rice and sell it at cost for relief. What else can we do? However, in this time of drastic foreign exchange contraction, ordering foreign rice is like drinking poison to quench thirst. Is this not unwise? No, the surge in rice prices is entirely caused by blocked sources and insufficient supply. Recent reports indicate signs of rice-grabbing riots. If we do not quickly develop solutions, how can the security of this city be maintained? Because the matter concerns the people's food supply, there is no time to delay. We should not dwell on these minor details. Some may say, 'Once foreign rice floods in, domestic rice will also come in from various sources. How will we compensate for the losses from setting rice prices?' This is a valid concern. However, when sources flood in, rice prices will inevitably fall. People will be relieved and grateful beyond words. Why talk about compensation? Moreover, there is a good plan to save both others and ourselves, but it requires the unified cooperation of all sectors. Sacrifice the small self to protect the larger self. People from all walks of life should be willing to help. What is the plan? We propose that all sectors (taking each family as a unit) entrust the organization to order a certain number of bags of foreign rice in the shortest possible time, paying a deposit of a certain amount per bag in foreign currency. Once a certain number is reached, a telegram will be sent to order the rice (at market price). We plan to start with various trade associations. Each factory or store should order several months' worth of rice as soon as possible. (The method is to first register with the respective trade associations, and then report the total number to the organization to order.) This will ensure their own supply for the time being, and with sufficient reserves, they will not have to rely on others. Even if rice comes in, few will be interested. According to economic principles, with supply exceeding demand, market prices will inevitably fall. This low-priced rice can be reserved for the poor to eat, providing relief in practice, even if not in name. The factories and stores will not suffer any losses, and the common people will benefit greatly. Here are a few draft articles for reference."

Organize a People's Food Maintenance Association

The draft articles of association for the Shanghai People's Food Maintenance Association are as follows: 1. The sole purpose of this association is to maintain the food supply of Shanghai citizens, not to make a profit. Therefore, it is named the Shanghai People's Food Maintenance Association. 2. This association is initiated by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the banking and money industry, and the rice industry associations, and is organized by gathering various groups, industry associations, and local gentry. A certain number of committee members will be appointed to be responsible for managing the association's affairs. 3. The association will first raise funds to cover all losses from subsidizing the purchase of rice, and will contact the banking and money industry to negotiate loans to purchase rice, so as to order the rice as soon as possible. 4. The association will order foreign rice from abroad in an open manner to demonstrate fairness and credibility. 5. The association will order rice from foreign firms or producing areas at any time, depending on the supply and demand of rice in the Shanghai market and the amount needed. 6. Regarding the transportation of foreign rice, we will request foreign shipping companies to give preferential treatment. 7. The payment for the rice purchased by the association will be temporarily paid by the banking and money industry. After the goods arrive, they will be stored in warehouses designated by the banking and money industry as security. We will negotiate for lower interest rates on the loans. 8. Rice merchants who entrust the association to purchase rice on their behalf will be charged a certain amount per bag for rescue fees to make up for the lack of rescue funds. No fees will be charged to non-rice merchants. Those who directly order from foreign firms can do so at their convenience. 9. Various industries, guilds, factories, etc. may entrust the association to order rice on their behalf, regardless of the quantity. The association will accept all orders and charge a deposit of a certain amount of silver per bag in advance, without any interest. The goods must be cleared upon arrival without delay. 10. For rice entrusted to the association for purchase, if the market price falls and the goods are delayed in being shipped, the deposit will be confiscated. If there is a shortfall, it should be compensated, and the guarantor will be jointly and severally liable for repayment. 11. Various industries that need rice may entrust their respective industry associations to entrust the association to purchase rice on their behalf. The industry association will be responsible. Those who do not belong to an association should find their own reliable guarantor. 12. The rice purchased by the association on behalf of others must be ordered in batches according to the quantity entrusted. Upon arrival of the goods, the entrusting parties will be notified to pay for and ship the goods. 13. Separate detailed rules will be formulated for various administrative matters of the association. 14. These articles of association will be implemented after being approved by various groups.

The Market Panic Has Subsided Slightly Yesterday

After the opening of the Shanghai bean and rice market yesterday morning, because various groups have raised funds to continue ordering foreign rice, and the Municipal Council has negotiated with the Japanese authorities on the free transportation of rice to Shanghai, and at the same time, the transportation of reserves from various places to Shanghai has not been completely cut off, the market panic has subsided slightly. It is also reported that the rice industry group has ordered the market management committee to stop the soaring of rice prices, so as not to affect the livelihood of the common people, and has advised vendors to find ways to transport rice from the producing areas to Shanghai for sale, so as to maintain the food supply of Shanghai. The actual market price of rice yesterday was 36 to 37 yuan per stone for high-quality粳rice.

Resorting to Desperate Measures, Public Security is Worrying

At about 1 PM yesterday, six or seven people suddenly came to a rice shop on Gan Shidong Road, dressed in rags and resembling rickshaw pullers. They grabbed rice from the rice boxes. Fortunately, the nearby police arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested them. They then scattered. The police immediately dispatched more police to guard the area. Rice shops along the road were tightly closed with iron gates, but retail sales continued as usual. The rice shops did not have much rice in stock, but the rice stored in the concessions is now piled up in private residences or hidden locations. The exact amount cannot be determined. Rice delivery trucks were also robbed along the way the night before.

Foreign Newspaper Reports Japanese Purchasing

According to a continental newspaper, the general impression is that Shanghai is currently experiencing a rice shortage due to a rice shortage in Japan. This impression was confirmed yesterday (the 20th). The Japanese agents within China are currently purchasing all available rice, and have entrusted a certain Shanghai shipping company in Saigon to order at least 7,000 tons of rice for immediate delivery. It was heard yesterday that 300,000 bags of various types of rice could be obtained in the suburbs of Shanghai. Farmers only 10 miles outside of Shanghai are currently selling rice for 20 yuan per dan. According to the most responsible sources, people were making large purchases in the suburbs of Shanghai before the end of the week, but by Sunday, only 11,000 bags had arrived in Shanghai. It was heard that another 10,000 bags arrived in Shanghai yesterday, but according to rice merchants, only a small portion of this amount was sold in the local market. It was also heard that the rice to be transported to the Public and French Concessions is now stored in warehouses in Hongkou. Japanese merchants have been hoarding rice there for some time, intending to make huge speculative profits in the Public Concession in the near future, which is without assistance. Merchants in the Public Concession are also hoarding rice, causing prices to continue to rise despite the large amounts of rice being transported in recent days. Rice is still sold for 15 yuan per dan in nearby rice-producing areas, but it is quickly purchased by Japanese merchants. Even rice sold to Shanghai merchants is greatly reduced when it is about to reach its destination, because large quantities have been confiscated.

Free Transportation to Shanghai, Negotiations Going Smoothly

Japan may have a rice shortage this year because large amounts of rice must be transported to the Japanese army in North China. If so, some of the rice stored in Hongkou may be transported to Japan. The Municipal Council acknowledged yesterday that the rice situation has not changed. The Council's negotiations with the Japanese authorities to lift the embargo on Wuhu have not yet received a reply. Also, the English-language "North China Daily News" reported that according to a Municipal Council official, the Municipal Council's discussions with the Japanese authorities to allow more free transportation of rice to Shanghai are progressing smoothly. This issue is expected to be resolved soon.

Songjiang Rice, Large Quantities Coming to Shanghai

According to shipping industry sources, Songjiang rice is being transported to Shanghai in a steady stream. Yesterday, the Minli Company's tugboat towed twelve rice boats, each carrying 115 to 200 dan, for a total of more than 2,000 dan. Today (the 24th), He Li Shipping Company will tow more than 30 boats to Shanghai. If due to the tide, they will arrive tomorrow morning. This second batch of rice totals more than 5,000 dan. It is also understood that the county government in the guerrilla area outside Songjiang is still working as usual. Starting today (the 24th), it will strictly order all rice shops to sell rice at a flat price of 18 yuan per dan. Rice exceeding this price will be confiscated. It is heard that the seriousness of the food problem in the hometown has been completely eliminated. According to reports, the Japanese army in Songjiang only guards one city wall. The four suburbs outside the city are all under the control of the guerrillas. Therefore, the power to manage the food supply is still in the hands of the Chinese army. Also, according to shipping industry sources, the rice price in Wu Ku Zhen above Songjiang has risen to more than 20 yuan per dan, arousing public anger. The rice in all rice shops in the town was moved out and distributed to each household.

### Tongfu Trading Company Employee Falsely Reports Robbery Case; Stolen Goods Recovered, Further Investigation Needed

Weng Yulin, a Ningbo native (21 years old, resident of 26 Taiwan Road), an employee of Tongfu Inland Trading Company at 260 Tianjin Road, suddenly reported to the French Concession Gaoen Road Police Station at about 10 AM yesterday that he had been ordered by manager Yang Jiqing to collect accounts from various customers. When he was collecting accounts from Yongheng Bank at 266 Ningbo Road, he saw

Three Men

One wearing a Western suit, one wearing a Xiangyun gauze short shirt and pants, and one wearing a long gown, waiting outside the door. When he came out, they immediately grabbed him onto a pre-arranged car. They drove through Henan Road, then Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, Avenue Messimy, and finally arrived at Zhao Zhujiao Road. At that time, the people in the car not only robbed him of the 2,800 yuan he had collected, but also tightly tied his eyes with a white cloth and pushed him out of the car. One of the three men, the one wearing a Western suit, was holding a pistol, etc. The French Police Station believed that the incident occurred in the jurisdiction of the Public Concession Central Police Station, so they transferred the case to that

Police Station for Investigation

After detailed investigation by Chinese Detective Jiang Shangpei, Detective Zhu Wanjun, and Western Detective Gashi Li, it was discovered that Weng's statement was suspicious. The gold ring that Weng was wearing was not robbed. Given the high price of gold, how could the robbers not have robbed the gold ring? Based on the route described by Weng, many detectives sent by the British and French Concession police to search for the car could not have missed it. Therefore, they questioned him in detail. After 12 hours of investigation and interrogation,

The Truth Was Revealed

The reason was that Weng had recently been addicted to gambling, going to gambling dens such as Hollywood Rongsheng, resulting in huge debts that he could not repay. Therefore, he came up with this false report. After receiving 2,800 yuan in gambling debts, he went to Zhonghua Book Company to buy a small leather suitcase, stored the money in it, and deposited it on the third floor of 22 Sijing Road at his cousin Weng Ahai's place. Then he bought a white cloth and hired a car to report to the police station. The detectives later recovered the original 2,800 yuan from 22 Sijing Road. At the same time, they also seized an Yong'an Company passbook with a deposit of more than 100 yuan. The Tongfu Company had recently been stolen 500 yuan worth of

Ninety Pieces of Silk

Whether this was also done by Weng is still under investigation. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for embezzlement under Article 336 of the Criminal Code. Because further investigation was necessary, he requested a postponement of the hearing. After questioning by Judge Qian Hongye, he was ordered to be detained for a rescheduled hearing.

### Car Collision, One Passenger Seriously Injured

At around 3:15 AM yesterday morning, a black-plated taxi, number 205, was traveling south on Yunnan Road at high speed. While crossing Fuzhou Road, it collided with a silver taxi company car carrying four passengers traveling west on Fuzhou Road. Both cars were damaged, but the silver car was severely damaged and suffered huge losses. One of the four passengers in the car, Liu Minghuai (27 years old, from Ningbo, resident of 52 Xiahui Lane, Xiahui Road, French Concession), had his left shoulder bone broken. The police who arrived at the scene sent the injured to Baojiang Hospital for treatment.

### Beating to Death for a One-Yuan Loan

Xu Asan from Yancheng quarreled and fought with his fellow townsman Liu Zhichang on Changping Road at 1:50 PM on the 12th of this month because the latter had not repaid a one-yuan loan. Liu was beaten in the waist by Xu and fell to the ground. He was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment but died. Xu was detained by the Gordon Road Police Station and sent to the First Special Court. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the trial yesterday morning and sentenced Xu Asan to five years in prison as a warning.

### Bloodshed Occurred on Xinzha Road Yesterday; Yan Jiulin Was Shot Dead; A Letter Was Left Beside the Body; Police Are Investigating

Yan Jiulin from Shaoxing, 49 years old, resident of Room 12, Hongqing Lane, 140 Xinwen Road, was fast asleep at 6:30 AM yesterday morning when two men suddenly broke in. One wore a black Xiangyun gauze shirt and pants, and the other wore a white cloth shirt and pants. They knocked on the door of Yan's room. Yan woke up and opened the door. The man in black immediately shot Yan twice with a gun. Yan was hit in the head and right breast, and fell into a pool of blood. The shooter took the opportunity to escape without a trace. The injured was sent to Baolong Hospital, but he died shortly after arriving at the hospital due to his serious injuries. After the incident, the police recovered two cartridges of Browning bullets in Yan's room and took them back for research. It is heard that Yan was once the head of the teahouse in a certain theater. Another story is that Yan had been a detective under the late Lu Liankui for many years and has now resigned. Although the reason for the killing is unknown, in addition to the cartridges, the police also found a letter left next to the deceased, which contained the reason for the killing. However, according to general observation, the case appears to be a vendetta. Yan's wife, Wang (30 years old), and a son named Ayuan, 16 years old, also live in the same house.

### Yizhong Tobacco Company Cigarette Robbery Case; Instigating False Accusation Sentenced; Little Hubei Tries to Harm Enemy But Harms Himself; Other Criminals Also Sentenced to Imprisonment

The Yizhong Tobacco Company, a British company in Lujiazui, Pudong, entrusted Yang Daosheng to transport its cigarettes by barge to various wharves for export. On the night of April 14 of this year, five large boxes of cigarettes, totaling 25,000 cigarettes, worth a considerable amount, were stolen from the barge in the Huangpu River. The company reported to the Water Police Station to request investigation. After the incident, Yao Shengshan, a gangster from Hubei in Pudong, nicknamed Little Xiangbei, intended to gain merit and also intended to

Frame His Enemy

Lin Daoyuan, (Lin is from Anhui and is a cargo foreman at Taikoo Wharf,) and also intended to seize Lin's position. Therefore, he conspired with Lao Qiang Wei Honglin, Lin Maotang, etc. to frame Lin. He asked Wei to come forward and admit that he had stolen the cigarettes under the instructions of Lin Daoyuan, causing Lin to be imprisoned. Yao would be responsible for Wei's family living expenses every month, and Yao would seize Lin Daoyuan's cargo foreman position and pay Wei an additional 15 yuan per month as a reward.

After Agreement

On April 18, Yao reported to the Water Police Station, and Wei Honglin was first arrested. Then Lin Daoyuan and Hu Guiqing (also known as Little Pockmark) were successively arrested, transferred to the French Police Station, and sent to the Second Special Court for investigation. As a result, because Lin Daoyuan's criminal suspicion was insufficient, the French Police Station did not prosecute him and requested that he be released first. Only Wei Honglin and Hu Guiqing were prosecuted for theft, and they were interrogated and detained. Lin Daoyuan learned the details of Yao Shengshan's false accusation and also reported to the French Police Station, requesting an investigation of Yao's false accusation. The French Police Station

Arrested Yao

And the Water Police Station continued to arrest the accomplices of the theft, Shen Jinguo, Yang Hengshun, Zhang Yunshan, etc., and sent them to the Second Special Court. Judge Zhu Chuzhe combined the cases for trial. The police lawyer prosecuted Yao Shengshan for false accusation, Wei Honglin for both false accusation and theft, and the other defendants for theft. During the interrogation, Yao Shengshan admitted that he conspired with Wei Honglin to falsely accuse Lin Daoyuan in order to harm Lin and seize his business. Wei Honglin confessed, "On the 16th, Little Hubei, that is, Yao Shengshan, told Lin Maotang to call me to the Ping'an Hotel,

Called Me to Help

Bite Lin Daoyuan to start a lawsuit, accusing Lin of instructing the theft of Yizhong Tobacco Company cigarettes, promising to subsidize my family expenses, and then give me an additional 15 yuan per month on the wharf. I was confused for a while and followed his false accusation." The other defendants admitted to conspiring to steal cigarettes without denial. The case has been interrogated and concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhu presided over the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court and sentenced Yao Shengshan to

Inciting False Accusation

Three months in prison. Wei Honglin was sentenced to six months in prison for theft and three months in prison for false accusation, serving a total of eight months in prison. Shen Jinguo was sentenced to eight months in prison for theft. Hu Guiqing, Yang Hengshun, and Zhang Yunshan were each sentenced to six months in prison for theft. During the appeal period, the defendants were all detained in the detention center.

### Indecent Behavior in Massage Parlor; Police Strictly Investigate and Handle

Fang Te'er, the Western head of the vice squad of the Old Kai Police Station, and Hua Sandao Tou, number 1013, in view of the recent situation in various massage parlors, in addition to engaging in prostitution, there are often incidents that harm public morals, so they went to various massage parlors for investigation. At 2:15 PM yesterday, Head Fang and others went to Die Lai Massage Parlor at 601 Ningbo Road for investigation and found Pu Qiting, a worker in the Qian industry, in Massage Room No. 7, completely naked. Wang Xiaomei (21 years old), a prostitute from Wuxi, was also naked beside him, performing manual masturbation for Pu. The heads believed that this action was related to social morals. If they were not severely punished, it would be difficult to warn others. Therefore, they took both the man and woman to the police station. Pu was allowed to be released on bail of 15 yuan, while Wang was detained. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Ninth Criminal Court of the First Court and requested to be severely punished according to law. Judge Shen Shanzeng questioned her and ordered the hearing to be closed to the public because the case concerned morals. As a result, they were given severe punishment to reverse the declining morality.

### Forcing a Young Girl into Prostitution; Three Criminals Severely Punished Separately

Wang Lindi (25 years old), a woman from Yancheng, and Li Laoer (28 years old), a woman from Changzhou, have recently been living the life of prostitutes in the Hongkou area. Last month, Wang Lindi took her 14-year-old adopted daughter, Zeng Cuihong, to Room 3 of the Huishan Hotel at 10 Dongbaihui Road and had her defiled by Yu Hengshun (28 years old), a traveler from Yangzhou, while Li Laoer helped in the middle. Afterwards, Zeng felt pain in her lower body and walked unsteadily, but forced by Wang Lindi's coercion, she could not escape. Until about 4 PM on the 15th of this month, she took the opportunity to escape and was wandering near Xiaoshadu Road when she was discovered by Chinese police number 3305 of the Xinzha Police Station. She was taken to the police station, and the police found out the details. The head ordered her to be transferred to the Huishan Police Station. At the same time, Wang Lindi, Li Laoer, and Yu Hengshun, three men and women, were detained by the First Court and interrogated in the case. Zeng was sent to Jiliang Institute for care. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi continued to hear the case in court. The case concerned morals and was closed to the public. As a result, Wang Lindi was sentenced to nine years and six months in prison, Li Laoer was sentenced to three years, and Yu Hengshun was sentenced to seven years, separately as a warning.

### Deformed Fetus, Surgical Procedure

Huang Zhixian, the wife of Yu Datong, a teacher at the Municipal Council Primary School, was about to give birth and was admitted to the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society on Haige Road on the 15th of this month. At noon on the 16th, she gave birth to a boy with an abnormally protruding navel. The obstetrics hospital summoned surgeons and pediatricians for consultation. Upon examination, it was found that the umbilical cord was severely swollen near the abdomen. The protruding part was only covered by a membrane, and a small hole was visible on the upper right of the membrane with a small amount of yellow gelatinous seepage flowing out. After discussion, the doctors determined that it was an umbilical hernia. (A hernia is when an organ protrudes. If the intestines are squeezed and not surgically returned to the abdomen, the child will die.) The current condition shows that the internal organs are squeezed into the umbilical cord. Surgery should be performed to seek a glimmer of hope. They informed the child's father, Yu Datong, that the infant's condition was serious. Since the membrane had begun to rupture, the internal organs would inevitably leak out completely, leading to death. Therefore, without surgery, there would be no cure. Performing surgery may offer a glimmer of hope, but because newborns are physically weak, there is a possibility of death before and after surgery. The child's father expressed understanding of this point and signed a surgical consent form. A photo was taken before the surgery (see photo). After the surgeon cut open the hernia sac, the entire swollen liver, gallbladder, and part of the large and small intestines were visible. The doctor tried to return the intestines to the abdominal cavity, but because the abdominal cavity was too small and the abdominal wall was underdeveloped, it was unusually narrow and could not accommodate the swollen liver and gallbladder. With the consent of the child's parents, and after the two jointly signed the surgical consent form, the fascia was cut from the mother's leg and sewn to the infant's abdominal wound to prevent the intestines from leaking out and to isolate the abdominal cavity from the outside. The child died one hour after the surgery. According to an investigation by the reporter, and after finding a photo of the infant, it is attached below for research by all sectors.

### Robbery Case in Xujiahui Town

The home of Zhou Fengting, a local resident who works as a tea servant at the Renji Hall at the Tie Lu Kou, Shizi Wan No. 18 on the west side of Xujiahui Town, was suddenly invaded by six robbers at 8:30 PM the night before. They were wearing Xiangyun gauze short shirts and pants and spoke with a Hakka accent. Three of them were each carrying a pistol, and two robbers were guarding the door. They robbed 80 yuan in legal tender and severely injured Zhou Fengting. After obtaining the stolen goods, they broke into the room of Zhou's newly married son-in-law, Ai Likang, and robbed him of 400 yuan in legal tender, a gold ring, a gold bracelet, two large and small leather suitcases, and more than 50 pieces of silk clothing. Ai's mother, Shen, argued slightly and was hit on the head with the butt of a gun by the robbers, and her face was covered with blood. After 20 minutes, they fled towards Hongqiao Road. Yesterday, the victims filed a report with the French police in charge and requested an investigation.

### Epidemic in the Two Concessions Is Becoming Increasingly Rampant; True Cholera Cases Continue to Be Discovered

Recently, the epidemic situation in various parts of the city has become increasingly rampant. Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yuqiaqing Road has continuously discovered five patients with true cholera in recent weeks. One, Chen Cai, is a peddler living at 72 Xiaodongmen Road. One, Xu Lu, is a female worker at British American Tobacco Company living at 8 Laobaian Lane, Min Tini Yin Road. One, Qian Weisheng, is a coppersmith living at 412 Jiaozhou Road. One, Wu Jin, lives at 147 Da Tong Road. One, Zhang Xiaoyou, is a coppersmith living at 1254 Jiangxi Road. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, several suspected cases of true cholera were discovered in the city, and their feces have been sent to the Municipal Council Health Department for testing. This shows that the spread of the epidemic is alarming. We urge residents to regulate their diet and not indulge in gluttony, so as to maintain their health.

### Robbers Open Fire and Wound a Person

Cao Hongkai, a 41-year-old man from Nantong, who has been farming vegetables in the Hongzhen countryside in eastern Shanghai, was suddenly confronted by more than ten robbers at 11 o'clock the night before. They swarmed into the residence of a Mr. Someone next door to rob it. Cao, upon hearing the alarm, immediately opened his door and went out to investigate. He was shot in the left chest by one of the robbers acting as a lookout at the gate. Bleeding profusely, he was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment in a rickshaw.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor,

I am writing to you because my client, Dong Yongjun, has informed me that the report in today's Shen Bao local news section regarding the instigation of a violent act does not align with the facts. My client has a contract with Chen Yunhua for the lease of the Katte Grand Theatre, which stipulates that he has the right of first refusal for continued lease after six months, provided that he formally notifies the other party one month in advance. In other words, the lessee can only terminate the lease if they express their intention to do so. Once the lessee has indicated their intention to continue the lease, the lessor cannot object. Unexpectedly, on the 6th of this month, at 7:00 AM, some unknown ruffians, posing as police officers, arrived at the theatre with over a dozen White Russians and forcibly occupied it. My client reported this to the Avenue Edward VII Police Station, who sent officers to investigate and ordered both parties not to operate the theatre, with the police temporarily guarding it pending a court resolution. Because the other party had already applied to the court for mediation which was unsuccessful, a lawsuit has been filed in accordance with the law. There was no battery, assault, or vandalism. Most of the equipment was added by my client, so there is no reason for him to destroy it himself. If such events had occurred, the police would have already initiated a public prosecution, so why would it be necessary to file a private prosecution now? Clearly, the report is completely inconsistent with the facts. I am deeply concerned that the public may be misled by the lack of accurate information and have therefore commissioned a representative to write to your chief editor requesting that this letter of correction be published in the "Letter to the Editor" section to avoid misunderstandings.

### Declaration of the Summer Health Exhibition

The summer season has arrived, afflicting people. We live in noisy metropolitan cities, the environment is confined, the air is polluted, and the food is unsanitary. During this summer season, diseases and epidemics are particularly active, causing disturbances such as typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery, killing countless people every year and harming society. A single act of carelessness can lead to infection and endanger lives. Thinking about this makes one shudder.

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, it has sheltered tens of thousands of refugees who still languish along the Shanghai Bund, leading unsettled lives. During this summer season, these people are confined to various shelters, where crowded conditions make the heat unbearable and exacerbate their suffering. The risk of disease and epidemics is particularly high, and if infections spread, not only will the lives of one or a few individuals be at stake, but the entire refugee population will be at risk. Therefore, the public officials responsible for the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association and leaders from all sectors of society have launched a campaign to raise funds for refugee health, advocating for the refugees. Their actions are admirable and worthy of respect.

We also deeply feel the importance of this responsibility. Relieving the refugees and eradicating epidemics is an urgent task for us. Although we recognize our limited strength, we dare not shirk our duty. Therefore, we have scheduled a three-day Summer Health Exhibition from August 24th to August 26th at the Ningbo Association Hall, showcasing various health models and charts related to summer health to promote awareness. In addition, we will also conduct preventive vaccinations, charitable sales of medicine, and promote the sale of philanthropy badges, to raise public awareness of summer health and to solicit the sympathy and assistance of all sectors of society for the fundraising efforts for refugee relief. We hope that all citizens and members of society will actively support us, ensuring that the funds raised are entirely used to provide for the refugees, fulfilling our moral responsibility, and expanding the impact to promote the success of the overall summer health movement, reduce epidemics, and maintain public health. If we can achieve this, we will be fortunate, the refugees will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate!

### Announcement Regarding the Postponement of the Exhibition

Initial preparations were complete, but the concession's state of alert required a delay.

As we approach the end of summer and the beginning of autumn, promoting health awareness is even more urgent.

We recognized that Shanghai's population is dense, and the risk of illness is high, especially during the summer months when epidemics are rampant and contagious. Furthermore, we observed that on this isolated island, there are still tens of thousands of refugees living in cramped conditions, suffering from the scorching heat and lacking the necessary health funds, making the need for funds even more pressing. Therefore, we initiated the Summer Health Exhibition to raise public awareness of health, eliminate disease, and generate funds through the sale of medicine to provide relief to the refugees, fulfilling our moral duty.

Since the launch of this initiative, we have received the agreement and support of the officials of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, as well as the love and support of manufacturers, pharmacies, organizations, and individuals from all sectors of society. Some have generously contributed articles, others have donated medicine, and still others have promoted the sale of vouchers, providing both spiritual and material assistance, which has made us feel even more encouraged and motivated to work harder!

However, regarding the date of the exhibition, the event was originally scheduled to open at the Ningbo Association Hall from August 7th to 9th, and all preparations were complete. However, an unexpected incident occurred. Due to the second anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai, the concession authorities, in order to ensure the safety of citizens, implemented a state of alert from August 7th to 15th, suspending all gatherings and instructing us to postpone the event. We had no choice but to comply and reschedule the event to today (the 24th). Although the delay was not our fault, we feel deeply apologetic for not being able to anticipate and prevent this situation beforehand.

Nevertheless, now that we are at the end of summer and the beginning of autumn, based on past experience, various epidemics and infectious diseases tend to be most active and rampant at this time (early autumn), and the population mortality rate also peaks at this time. This is because the nature of the climate changes from summer to autumn, but people often fail to pay attention to this. A moment of carelessness can lead to illness. Therefore, although we have delayed the event until now, we feel that promoting health awareness is even more important and urgent. We dare not only encourage ourselves, but also hope that everyone will understand, support, and correct us!

### Honorary Committee of the Exhibition

### The Significance of the Summer Health Exhibition Organized by the Yiyou Society

— Xi Yushu

The Yiyou Society is composed of shop employees from various stores in Shanghai and is a pure organization that enhances the physical and mental well-being of young working people. It has always been eager to take the lead in public welfare undertakings, so the Yiyou Society has established a reputation in Shanghai society. The Yiyou Society regrets that it was unable to participate in advance in the "Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Fundraising Health Expenses Committee" organized by ten groups including pharmaceutical and medical professions. However, its spirit of courage and righteousness has never wavered. The "Summer Health Exhibition" it is organizing has been approved and supported by the Fundraising Health Expenses Committee. The considerations of this exhibition are very far-reaching. The Yiyou Society bears the responsibility of publicity and makes up for the shortcomings of the Fundraising Committee. In the future, it will reap great benefits. Exhibition publicity is one of the important factors, and this exhibition can be said to be appropriate for the occasion. The word "health" has become the most popular term on the streets today, but the understanding of the meaning and importance of health has not yet penetrated deeply and universally. The Yiyou Society can take advantage of this opportunity to collect health information, hold an exhibition, enlighten citizens about health knowledge, and guide them in strategies for preventing epidemics, which is really appropriate for the time. Therefore, the Summer Health Exhibition organized by the Yiyou Society is timely and appropriate and is truly a win-win situation.

### Why Hold a Summer Health Exhibition?

— Jiang Junyi

The Yiyou Society is scheduled to hold a Summer Health Exhibition at the Ningbo Association Hall from August 24th to 26th. Its motivation is not only to raise public awareness of summer health in Shanghai but also for the public good. This is a highly commendable act of justice in the consistent spirit of the Yiyou Society serving the community.

Although in the past year or two, the Shanghai Concession authorities have made great efforts in summer health, universally administering preventive measures and carrying out various health promotion activities to prevent problems before they arise, which has achieved great results, this kind of summer health promotion is not a matter of a single period or direction. It must be promoted and worked on by all social groups and organizations together, and then greater results can be achieved. Therefore, the Yiyou Society's Summer Health Exhibition can also be said to be a contribution to the Concession authorities in promoting summer health awareness among citizens.

The Refugee Relief Association in this city has recently confirmed that this is a public welfare act that is urgently needed at present, and it is indeed of great importance to the safety of all citizens in Shanghai. The Yiyou Society's exhibition can also be said to be a response to the Refugee Relief Association's act of seeking welfare for the refugees and jointly fulfilling its responsibility to serve society. I congratulate the Yiyou Society on the great success of this Summer Health Exhibition!

### For What?

— Zhao Puchu

These days, the Summer Health Exhibition is once again intensifying the atmosphere in the Yiyou Society. Some people say, "For what? They are always so unafraid of being busy, and they are not afraid of the heat and passion, and they really like them very much. Being busy and sweating is our own summer health movement."

But really, for what?

We have stated repeatedly that the Yiyou Society was created because of the needs of society. Specifically, there are many people in the real world who need help: economically, intellectually, morally, health-wise, and in all aspects of life, they all need help. However, what they can get is so small and pitiful! Therefore, the Yiyou Society was created under this kind of need, and the Yiyou Society has grown up in this kind of "helping" work.

Speaking of this Summer Health Exhibition, of course, it is not a very remarkable thing. For us, it is just a hope to follow the service spirit of the advanced people from all walks of life in Shanghai and to do our best in the movement to raise funds for summer health for the refugees after joining the Refugee Relief Association. However, the encouragement and support we have received from the advanced people from all walks of life has exceeded what we should have received—it is particularly large and particularly enthusiastic. This not only makes us more energetic in this work, and we are not afraid of sweating, but also makes us have a clearer confidence in the work we have done in the past.

We will use this health exhibition as the starting point for making a greater contribution to society, and continue to do our best to engage in things that benefit people, so that more people can be helped. If we can achieve even one ten-thousandth of the result, what is the "busyness" and "heat"?

I remember that Sakyamuni Buddha once said this sentence: "I am bearing a body of blood and flesh for the benefit of the world." This should be able to answer the question "For what?"!

### Besides "I" and "Gold"

— Fan

Perhaps because of the saying that "Shanghai is full of gold," people's consideration of all problems, in addition to how to connect "I" and "gold," seems to be unable to think of other things, and even feels that there are no other problems in the world!

We have stated repeatedly that the Yiyou Society was created because of the needs of society; specifically, it is because there are actually many important problems in the world besides how to connect "I" and "gold," and they need to be solved; and the focus of the problem is on how to expand the scope of "I" so that people can also do some "big I" things outside of the "small I." The Yiyou Society was created under this kind of need, and it has grown up in this kind of work; naturally, it should continue and expand in this way in the future.

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the area of residence has shrunk, but the population has increased greatly. There are naturally many reasons for this, which do not need to be studied here, but the result of the population increase has made the already serious housing problem even more serious. More than a dozen families live in one house, which used to be a topic for cartoonists, but now it has long lost its capital. It is common for three families to live in one pavilion. We can imagine that when the protagonists who live in this house return to this "home" to rest with their tired bodies after the usual twelve or thirteen hours of work, the chances of disease and death are not difficult to imagine. But, after all, they are still living in houses. As for the refugees who survived the shelling, and the poorest people who live in reed sheds like the refugees, it goes without saying.

As mentioned above, the Yiyou Society has grown up in the work of "serving the big I." This means that we have already had many services in the past, but we are not satisfied, and we will never be satisfied in the future. This Summer Health Exhibition is to respond to the call of the Refugee Relief Association, which is combined with the "big I" spirit of the leaders of all walks of life in Shanghai. We hope to do our best in the great work of raising funds for summer health for the refugees; at the same time, we want to use this exhibition as the starting point for making a greater contribution to society. We will inherit and carry forward the spirit of this exhibition.

### Talk About Summer Health Movement

— Yan Fan

Summer is coming, this terrible season, the scorching sun, the oppressive heat, the invasion of epidemics, the difficulty of the heat wave!, indeed, summer is a serious threat and a terrible shadow to people!

According to the annual report of the Public Works Bureau last year, the death rate of the public concession alone in 1938 was 55,609 people. We can predict that this alarming number must account for the largest number in the summer, and the epidemics and typhoid fever in the diseases. Stomach problems, etc., are most likely to occur in late summer and early autumn, and most of those who suffer from the disease are our colleagues and working people. This can be proven in every college and pharmacy, because we are the worst-living people in society, living in narrow residences and eating unclean food. In addition, we work all day long, which of course has a great relationship with maintaining our health!

Therefore, "Yiyou Society" has long felt the importance and urgency of the summer health problems of our vast community members. We have been working hard and actively to fight for the relief of the suffering and national crisis of this problem. Over the past half month, we have launched and prepared the "Summer Health Epidemic Prevention Movement" and implemented free epidemic prevention injections in the community from June 27 to July 15. Today, the community is holding a Summer Health Exhibition to respond to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's solicitation of refugee health funds. We hope that all members will pay extra attention, which is closely related to our interests, and must not miss this opportunity. At the same time, everyone must participate in and complete this movement so that we can become more literate and more universal, so that all members can extend to all refugees and all citizens can enjoy this benefit.

The devil of disease is a robber, and the epidemic is as vicious as the invaders. We hope that everyone will make every effort to launch and complete this summer health movement with the greatest enthusiasm and the same spirit of preventing invasion and disaster!

### Summer Health and Well-being

— Shi Zhifu

The level of climate temperature has a great impact on the human body, just like what Fahrenheit said: Being quietly in a hot environment is the same as working hard in cold weather, so the body is most easily consumed, fatigued, and even weakened in resistance in the summer. Furthermore, highly contagious germs such as cholera and typhoid fever are most suitable for the intense environment, so their rampant period is also in this season. The spread of disease is entirely due to mosquitoes, and they are also the most common thing in summer and autumn. In short, the health of the human body is most threatened in summer, especially in the two concessions where the population is crowded. It is difficult to popularize pharmaceutical equipment, and the general health knowledge of each family cannot be known to every resident. Often, the neglect of a patient causes a family, a neighborhood, or even spreads out, making it uncontrollable. What is different in recent years is that tens of thousands of refugees have been added. Because they have been affected by the war, they have become homeless, living in dark and dilapidated houses, dozens or hundreds of them squeezed together, with no tables, no chairs, and no beds. They lie on the ground, including excretion, all together. How can such a life guarantee no danger! If an infectious disease occurs, it will soon spread throughout the entire place, naturally expanding to a wider range, adding a threat to the residents of the concession. The so-called fire in the city gate affects the fish in the moat, but it is probably too late to climax relief by that time. Therefore, the purpose of the association is to make the public understand health knowledge, and at the same time collect donations, promote the sale of goods, assist refugees, improve their health facilities, reduce the threat of disease, seek safety for refugees, and also seek safety for the millions of compatriots living in the concession. I hope that all sectors will provide more help!

### Exploitation

— Yang Jinhao

Hitler, exploiting Chamberlain's anti-communist wishes, signed the "Anti-Comintern Pact" with Japan and Italy, using the guise of an anti-communist vanguard to deceive Britain into tacit agreement, annexing Austria and Czechoslovakia in Central Europe, and then attempting to invade Poland in Eastern Europe.

Chamberlain, exploiting Hitler's "anti-communist" stance, willingly allowed the little dictator to advance into Central Europe, hoping that he would quickly seize Ukraine and fight Stalin, so that he could sit back and wait for the removal of the thorn in his side, the Soviet Union, and reap the benefits in the event of a mutually destructive conflict.

Who knew that the result of "anti-communism" was the exclusive occupation of weak countries, and the seizure of colonies from Britain and France. To avoid being fooled again, Chamberlain used Stalin, putting on an "anti-aggression" facade, pretending to establish an "Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance" to force Hitler to comply and quickly cash the "anti-communist" check, letting the Soviet Union take the brunt of the fighting.

Stalin, however, exploited Chamberlain's insincerity, cleverly maneuvering in front of Hitler, signing a "Commercial Agreement" with Germany and negotiating a "Non-Aggression Pact" while discussing the "Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance". In this way, he also exploited Hitler to implement his "peace" policy, letting those imperialists quarrel and fight each other.

In international relations, there is only a struggle for interests, and no war of ideologies. However, there are differences in the scope of vision and the ingenuity of methods.

It seems that the most cunning one is Chamberlain, but his vision is the most short-sighted and his methods the most clumsy. The "appeasement policy" and the "Munich Conference," in the fantasy of instigating a "anti-Soviet" war, have repeatedly harmed his own interests and weakened his own hegemony. If he continues to be generous at the expense of others, trying to trick others into being "fooled," then he can only continue to be "generous" himself and continue to be fooled.

Hitler's exploitation of Chamberlain has reached its limit, so there is no need to shout about "anti-communism" anymore; now he is going to provoke the timid and cowardly, raising the banner of "anti-British". However, if he continues to take risks, he will indeed make Britain and France suffer, but he himself will also change from a nouveau riche back into a bankrupt.

Stalin's methods are still the most ingenious, turning the Soviet Union from being "isolated" by encirclement on all sides into being "isolated" with flattery from all sides. The future world war is no longer a war against aggression, but a war of imperialists. The Soviet Union will never fall into the trap of provoking war by old foxes, but will make the imperialists fight each other to the death. This is Stalin's high opinion now.

However, what kind of situation will ultimately result from this international mutual exploitation cannot yet be predicted. Let's listen to the next episode!

Four minor celebrities were leisurely sitting in room number two of the ×× Restaurant. The central figure was Li, the comprador of the ×× Trading Company. But he felt very uncomfortable because Zhou ××, who was only an assistant manager in the ×× Bank, was fat, and Shao, the administrative director in the ×× Foreign Company, was also fat. As for the other one, also fat, named Jin ×, who was a deputy bank manager, but Li the comprador was skinny, absolutely lacking the demeanor that gentlemen should have. So, facing these three characters, Li the comprador himself couldn't believe that he was a gentleman with hundreds of thousands of fortunes.

After the serious matters were settled, they simply couldn't find a way to pass the time, which was also quite painful.

Suddenly, that Director Shao put down his wine glass and said with emotion:

"Zhao ×× is simply outrageous. He's full of rice and only minds other people's business, meddling and making it all unclear..."

Then he sighed.

Comprador Li, with a "weird" expression, quickly asked:

"Old Shao, what's the matter? What did Zhao ×× come to bother you about?"

"Humph, humph."

He snorted through his nose and slowly said, "He said that the refugees housed in the refugee shelters are having difficulties with supplies..."

"Yes, yes..."

Deputy Manager Jin ×× interrupted as if a martial artist had jumped out from backstage: "He came to me too, going on and on, saying a lot about refugee this and refugee that. Sigh, I simply didn't want to listen..."

"That's right, who wants to listen," Comprador Li exhaled the cigar smoke he had inhaled violently. He seemed to see a letter from Zhao ×× in the smoke, and he said resentfully: "He's really like a (blank) trickster," especially giving me a letter. At first, I thought he was recommending some business, who knew..."

"What? " the director quickly asked.

"What else can it be," the comprador said quickly, "it's still about refugees, it's really annoying, and he even wants me to reply!" He took another puff of his cigar.

Jin × blinked, he said angrily:

"Li, he's being quite polite to you."

"Polite? Humph." The other party said coldly.

"To me, he's frankly and rudely demanding," the deputy bank manager slammed his cup on the table, "he's asking me to sponsor ten refugees every month..."

Comprador Li frowned and thought: "He's sponsoring ten, doesn't that mean I have to sponsor twenty."

"Do you think, isn't he hateful?" The deputy bank manager just shook his head, "He's so happy for the refugees, what are refugees anyway?"

At this time, Assistant Manager Zhou spoke, shaking his head slightly:

"Zhao is a distant relative of mine. He was very polite at first, but who knew he came yesterday, and it was all refugees this and that, such a long speech, I simply couldn't stand it, but he shamelessly came to demand from me too."

"Um, um."

Comprador Li stretched lazily.

"He said that gasoline is now selling for two yuan and four jiao per gallon, and told me to drive less often, so that there would be a considerable surplus to help the refugees. Do you think, am I supposed to take the tram and the public bus?"

"Yes, yes!"

Comprador Li touched his thin chin.

Administrative Director Shao said coldly:

"Little Zhou, he was at least discussing with you. But me, he was lecturing me like an old guy. I often go to dance halls and movie theaters, but that's just to relieve the dryness of work. Later, he even said this to me, 'Cutting down on a few dances and one or two movies is enough to pay for one refugee's monthly expenses.' How unreasonable!" He sighed repeatedly, followed by a burst of cold laughter.

"He really has mental problems."

Comprador Li closed his eyes, then suddenly opened them, thought for a moment, and called out loudly, "Oh, boy! Oh!"

The boy scurried in like a mouse, standing stiffly in front of them.

"Bring beer; also, call the ×× Company and tell them to hurry up."

The boy retreated again stiffly.

Jin ×'s spirits seemed to be flagging, and he yawned blankly, falling onto the sofa with a thud and waving his hand.

The spittoon sighed, "Psh!"

### Two Bandits

— Written by John Aikin, Translated by Zhu Yusun

Characters: Alexander—the famous Greek leader

Leader of the Balkan Peninsula—a bandit chief

Alexander (hereinafter referred to as A): Ha! Are you the bandit of the Balkan Peninsula? I already know much about your deeds.

Bandit Chief of the Balkan Peninsula (hereinafter referred to as B): I am an islander of the Balkan Peninsula, a soldier.

A: Hmph! Soldier? More like a thief, a robber, a rogue, a scourge of society. I admire your audacity, but I hate you and must punish you.

B: What have I done that you should control me?

A: Haven't you defied my authority and disrupted public peace? Isn't your life entirely spent harming the lives and property of your compatriots?

B: Alexander! Although I am your prisoner, I must listen to what you are pleased to say and endure the punishments you bestow. But my heart cannot be subdued. Would I be freed if I refuted the various crimes you accuse me of?

A: Speak! Although I have the power to stop you from speaking, I do not deign to do so.

B: Then, before answering your questions, I must ask you, how have you lived your life?

A: The life of a hero! If you ask about my reputation, it will fully tell you that among the brave, I am the bravest, among the emperors, I am the noblest, and among the conquerors, I am the greatest.

B: Isn't my reputation the same? Where is there a leader as brave as I am? Where? But I don't deign to boast. You must know that I am not easily subdued!

A: But what are you? You are nothing but a bandit, a vulgar person, a dishonest thief.

B: What is a conqueror? In this world, you are nothing but a malicious trickster. You destroy peace, the brilliant fruits of industry, you (blank space) rob, (blank space), slaughter, abandon laws, have no justice, and only know how to fill your endless desire for territory. Aren't you like this? In total, I only help about a hundred companions to operate in small areas, while what you and your tens of millions of colleagues do affects the fate of the entire nation. If I am robbing single travelers, then you are killing the masses. If I am burning down some villages, then you are destroying and trampling the most prosperous countries and cities in the world. The only difference between you and me is that I am only a selfish me, while you are an emperor, a bandit more powerful than me!

A: But while I enjoy the rights of an emperor, I also grant the treatment of an emperor to others. While I destroy capitals, I can build even bigger ones. Moreover, I am promoting art, commerce, and philosophy!

B: Am I not doing the same? I take the property of the rich, but I also naturally provide for the poor. Among the wicked, I also establish order and teach lessons. I also extend my hand to protect oppressed compatriots. Indeed, I am not very clear about the philosophy you speak of, but I know that even you or I must redeem half of the infamy that you and I have left in this world.

A: Get out! Are we the same? Alexander is a bandit? Let me think about it!

It is the verdant childhood,

Summer stars luring longings;

I, too, once had absurd, beautiful dreams.

But now, faintly in my ears, I hear the roar of the seabed.

In a daze, amidst countless desolate graves in the wilderness,

Lies countless round eyes bursting with anger.

Consciousness urges me to look at the world squarely,

I dare to swear to the heavens,

Never to dream those light, fleeting dreams again.

The blood and sweat of laborers,

The eruption of volcanoes,

The rushing of roof tiles,

Struggles, cries,

I will weave these into powerful poems,

Silently to show people!

### From "Nine Whirlwinds" to Saying Song Dezhu (Part 1)

— Only Me

—Also Introducing Four Students of the Opera School

News has arrived that the master of a generation, the renowned martial actress Nine Whirlwinds (Yan Lanqiu), passed away from illness in the old capital some days ago. This is not only a great loss to the opera world, but there will never be another martial actress talent like him. The role of martial actress is "difficult," so not many people study it. Because not many study it, for the past twenty years, there has been no one like Nine Whirlwinds. A martial actress who is only skilled in martial arts cannot be considered a complete talent. She must be beautiful, have a refined spirit, sing sweetly, and have skillful techniques to be considered perfect. Nine Whirlwinds not only had superior martial arts skills, but also a voice and beautiful appearance. He could still perform "The Little Buffalo Boy," "Hongni Pass," and "Battle of Wancheng." Eight years before retiring with a beard to teach and enjoy his later years, Zhu Shengfu and Yan Shishan, who quickly graduated, were taught by him. Now that Nine Whirlwinds has passed away, some say his nephew Yan Shishan has considerable talent and will surely inherit his uncle's mantle. While this may be true, Shishan is unlikely to be comparable to Lanqiu. The one who can become the second Nine Whirlwinds and be considered a perfect talent should be Song Dezhu.

Song Dezhu is a top student at the Beiping Opera School. While at school, he, Zhao Jinrong, Wang Helin, and Wang Jinlu were leading figures. Dezhu originally studied martial actress, so he has a solid foundation in martial arts. Later, he also performed roles of the young female characters. Because of his talent, he has achieved considerable success. Dezhu has a beautiful appearance, a good voice, and excellent stage presence. His techniques and acrobatic skills are unique. His tumbling in "Two Wolf Pass" is unprecedented. Other plays, such as "Hongqiao Presents Pearls," "Loyal Martyrs," and "Yang Jiaofeng," were all popular at the time. He also excels in warrior roles, such as "Sister Thirteen," "Muke Village," and "The Women's Army." Since graduating, he formed the Yingguang Troupe and performed in Ping. It is said that he sings all kinds of operas, including "Farewell My Concubine" and "Fourth Son Visits His Mother." While this shows Dezhu's versatility, these roles are not suitable for him and may be counterproductive. When Xu Biyun was studying at Binqing Troupe, she originally studied martial actress, but her martial actress skills were not very good. After graduating, she relied on her voice and switched to Qingyi and Huashan roles. However, her abandonment of her original specialty was due to environmental factors. Dezhu's martial actress roles are already excellent, and his warrior roles are already an extra. Now he wants to perform Qingyi and Huashan roles. Not only is it illogical, but it also hinders his future. The reason why Li Wanchun could not inherit Yang Xiaolou's legacy is that he liked to show off his skills and even sang "Arrest and Release" and "Empty City Stratagem." This is a good example to learn from, and Dezhu should think twice. It is said that the Golden Grand Theater has invited Dezhu and will perform with Yang Baosen in Shanghai. I sincerely hope he accepts my advice and does not perform outside his scope. Dezhu has many private operas, with at least fifty martial actress and warrior roles. Since Dezhu's martial arts are excellent, he should offer them to the audience. Since Yu Yuqin and Nine Whirlwinds have passed away, Song Dezhu is the ideal figure for the audience. I hope Dezhu can become a modern Yu Yuqin and Nine Whirlwinds, and I do not want Dezhu to be compared to the Four Great Dan, this is my meaning.

Random Notes on Artists

### One Aspect of Acting Experience (Part 2)

— Sun Min

Discussing the Difficulty of Playing Villains Versus Heroes

Playing a villain is an actor playing a role; playing a hero is the role playing the actor. Because in every film, whether it's the script, visuals, or supporting roles, the focus is mostly on the hero, and everyone else is used to highlight him. Therefore, playing this kind of role is effortless and easily wins the audience's sympathy. The performance of a villain, on the other hand, goes against everything, often arousing great aversion from the audience. At the same time, this aversion is a great help to the hero. In other words, it's almost like acting for the hero. For example, the more the audience hates the villain, the more sympathy they give the hero. Therefore, the actual gain still belongs to the hero. The villain is often in a supporting role and easily overlooked and unrewarded.

Looking at the current international stage, German leader Hitler is a famous villain. Under his consistent policy of aggression, he acts perversely and does everything. He is so fierce. Such acting with sound and color is very difficult, but his harvest from the audience is only resentment and curses. There are almost no people applauding him. On the other hand, American President Roosevelt is a hero. He only needs to lightly send a few telegrams upholding justice against Hitler's reckless and unreasonable fallacies, without much effort, and he has already won worldwide praise and applause. It is clear that Hitler is acting for him on the negative side. If there were no hateful villain, the hero would not be so respectable and lovable.

In short, playing a hero is the normal situation, while playing a villain is an abnormal performance. The difficulty between them is clear. After playing heroes for a long time, I switched to playing villains for many years and have had a deeper experience of this. My opinion has always been that an actor should be able to play many kinds of roles. In recent years, I have only played villains, which is entirely due to the environment and not my own wish. To put it more deeply, it is a regret in my heart.

### A Short Preface to the Ankang Gathering (Part 1)

— Tianxu Wosheng

What does the word Ankang mean? There is no definite conclusion, but it is commonly known as Tanhuang, which is undeniable. However, I believe that Southern and Northern dramas originally took place names. Yue Opera, Qin Opera, and Kun Opera are the most obvious examples, and Pihuang is the same. The word Ankang is actually the names of Lin'an and Jiankang. The Southern Song Dynasty moved its capital to Lin'an, which was inherited from Jiankang. By the time of Emperor Gongzong, Yuan Boyan occupied Lin'an, and Zhao Min, who was left to guard the Nanjing palace, had already abandoned Jiankang and fled. When Wen Tianxiang came out of the northern camp, the seven-character quatrains he composed, connected one after another, each preceded by a paragraph of prose, describing the situation at the time in great detail, were exactly the same in format as the storytelling and ballad singing of today, where every time a section is sung, the strings are stopped and dialogue or expression is inserted. This is then, Ankang, is the Southern opera legacy of Wen Tianxiang, I believe. As for the word Tanhuang, it is actually the error of Taihuang. In the Complete Works of Wenshan, there is proof of this. The sea ship he took from Tongzhou was the Sanjiang ship from Taizhou, and when he landed from the sea ship to the shore of Taiwan, he first stayed at Zhang Zhezai's house, falsely claiming to be surnamed Liu. When he passed Huangyan into the territory of Tiantai, he restored his original name. Then the poems of records must be announced in Tiantai and Huangyan, then spread at once, and become eternal. The survivors of the Southern Song Dynasty used it to praise the loyalty and righteousness of Xinguo, just like the string music of Wucheng. Extended to other similar past history, it can not be mentioned in the same breath with the blind words of three strings alone. Since it is the legacy of Southern Song music, not Yuan music, it is called Zhongyuan rhyme after the fall of the country. Some say that Ankang is the legacy of the Tang Dynasty. If so, then it is better to trace back to the Jin Dynasty, with Xie An of Dongshan silk and bamboo and Ji Kang of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove as its distant ancestors, wouldn't it be wonderful? There are originally seven people in the Ankang Gathering of our Hangzhou, and the one who plays the three-stringed instrument is usually in the first seat, which is the great Ruan of the Seven Sages. Therefore, I think the three-stringed instrument is actually a Ruan. The Japanese Shamisen is also a Ruan, but its circulation in the world. (To be continued)
