(Chongqing) The Chinese side today received victorious military reports from various quarters. According to a telephone message from Shanxi Province, the main force of the Japanese 20th Division launched a westward attack on the Zhongtiao Mountains (transliteration) in an attempt to eliminate the Chinese army in the mountains of western Shanxi.

Nanyang: After suffering setbacks in various places in western Shanxi and at Yumengkou, the Japanese army in Shanxi has recently shifted its target to the Zhongtiao Mountains and southeastern Shanxi. A part of the Japanese army from Hejin moved south. Approximately 4,500 Japanese troops were added to Jiangxian, 2,3000 to Yuncheng, and over 1,000 to Jiexian. The Japanese army from Daoqingqian increased by 2,000 troops from Jiaozuo to Boai. Two hundred Japanese engineers and over a dozen laborers were seized by the Japanese army in Jiexian, escorted by armed forces, and have been building roads southward towards Ershililing for days, reaching Qilipo.

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the Chinese guerrillas are now taking advantage of the weakness of the Japanese army and continuing to operate on the border between Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan. As a result, Japanese transportation depots are greatly threatened. It is said that passenger and freight transport on the Ping-Sui Railway has not yet been restored. Trains from Ping to Sui can only reach Zhangjiakou because the war has not stopped in the areas of Fengzhen, Datong, Yanggao, and Tianzhen. (Quick News Agency dispatch on the 27th)

Wuyuan: A person from the Zhonggong Banner of the Ulanqab League reported that over 100 puppet troops recently arrived at the banner's Wangfu, including several Japanese officers.

(Quick News Agency dispatch on the 27th)

Wuyuan: After being defeated, the remnants of the puppet army led by Yu Zhiqian were surrounded by the Chinese army in the Guyang Hejiaotang area for a week. They only broke through the encirclement the day before yesterday and fled in a panic to Guyang. The Chinese army captured a large number of military horses, weapons, and ammunition. (Dispatch on the 26th)

Tongguan: (1) At dawn on the 25th, a battalion of a certain Chinese unit attacked the Japanese army in Congshan Village and engaged in battle with the Japanese army. As of 9:00 AM, fierce fighting was still underway. (2) On the evening of the 24th, the Zhang Regiment of the Kong Brigade of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army in Zhang Village. Before dawn, a part of the force rushed into the village and began street fighting. By about 7:00 AM, over 70 Japanese soldiers had been killed. Because the Chinese side's goal had been achieved, they safely withdrew. (3) On the 24th, the Japanese army advanced on the positions near Huataopo, Lijiangxiang Village in three routes, each with 500-600 men, 7-8 cannons, and covered by several aircraft, and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese side. The Zhang Regiment of the Wang Brigade of the Chinese army calmly responded to the attack. After a day of fierce fighting, countless Japanese soldiers were killed. The Chinese side also suffered slight casualties. Finally, due to the disparity in numbers, they transferred to Qiankoukou and advanced at an opportune moment. (4) Over 1,000 Japanese soldiers, with several cannons, attacked west along the south side of the mountain from Ershiling at 12:00 on the 24th and engaged in battle with the Wang Brigade on the line in Zhuyang Village. After five hours, the Japanese and Chinese sides suffered heavy casualties. (5) The Japanese army from Liuguan advanced east to Zhaijiazhuang and engaged in battle with the Wang Guerrilla Detachment.

Most of the Japanese army retreated to Jiexian, and a part fled west. The Chinese side completely recaptured the positions around Majialing and Moao and is currently pursuing them. (Dispatch on the 27th)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, fierce fighting is still ongoing near the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi. Highland 150, one of the Chinese army's positions, was once broken through by the Japanese army. The Chinese army launched a counterattack with reinforcements and repelled the Japanese army. However, the Japanese army is still constantly sending reinforcements, and the Chinese army is resolutely resisting. According to Chinese military sources, the Japanese army's purpose in invading the Zhongtiao Mountains is twofold: (1) to eliminate the threat to Jiexian and Fenglingdu; (2) to attempt to occupy the mountains in order to control Pinglu and Shanzhou on the south bank of the Yellow River.

### The Japanese Army Invades Xiangyang Without Progress

(Yichang) In the past few days, there have been many rumors about the situation east of Yichang. According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army is attacking Xiangyang and Fancheng by dividing its forces from Zaoshi in the Jingshan area, and another route is advancing towards Mianyang, probably aiming at Shashi. The two sides have already engaged in battle. According to reliable Chinese sources, the Japanese army has not made any major progress on any route. Two hundred people, including the supervisors and staff of the Wesley School in Anlu Town, 95 miles east of Yichang, took refuge in Yichang on Sunday. Refugees coming west will inevitably come in an endless stream in the future. If that is the case, it would be most unfortunate, because Yichang is now full and transportation to the upper reaches has been reduced to a minimum. Since Chongqing was attacked by Japanese aircraft on January 15, many people have returned here from there. January 24 was the first anniversary of the Japanese air raid on Yichang. The most recent bombing was on January 21. Air raid alarms have been issued frequently in recent weeks, but bombs were not dropped until that day, but most of them were Japanese aircraft and reconnaissance planes passing through here on their way to Chongqing. Yichang is still peaceful. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)

Changde: According to a phone call from Shashi, a certain Chinese army unit in Hubei captured Jingshan and approached Zaoshi. The Japanese army in Yingcheng sent reinforcements, so the war on that route is still fierce. (Dispatch on the 27th)

Editorial

### How to Commemorate "January 28th"

Seven years ago today, the Chinese nation launched its first determined resistance against Japan in Shanghai. In this war, China, with a small number of troops such as the 19th Route Army, resisted the joint attack of the Japanese navy, army, and air force. Japan mobilized 100,000 troops, changed commanders three times, and fought hard for three weeks, but was still confined to a corner of Shanghai. At that time, if China had not been politically disunited and the civil war had not ended, it would not have been possible for a small number of troops to engage in a local war, resulting in failure and the signing of the humiliating Shanghai Truce Agreement. On the contrary, it would have inevitably expanded into a full-scale war, serving as the prelude to the Chinese nation's war of independence and liberation.

Although the result of this war was a failure, it yielded many valuable lessons. First, it proved the fallacy of determinist theories. Before "January 28th," all pessimists and defeatists believed that China's weapons were inferior to Japan's, and that if it resisted Japan, it would inevitably be defeated and would perish. It is true that China's weapons were far inferior to Japan's, but weapons can be enhanced through human effort, so the important element that determines the outcome of a war is people, not weapons. In the "January 28th" War, although the weapons of the 19th Route Army and others were far inferior to Japan's, they were still able to resist the Japanese invasion in the Shanghai area for a month. This fact, in addition to proving the fallacy of weapon determinism, also made the people of the whole country realize that China not only has the power to resist Japanese aggression, but can also achieve victory. Second, it proved that China must unite all parties and factions with the sole and highest goal of resisting Japan in order to win victory. At the time of the "January 28th" War, although China was superficially unified, in reality there was friction between the central government and local governments, and there was opposition between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The latter adopted the method of civil war, making the war of resistance against Japan a local war fought only by a small number of troops, and giving Japan the opportunity to defeat them individually. Therefore, this resistance war ultimately failed. Third, it proved the accuracy of Chairman Chiang's theory that "once the war begins, we can only risk the life of the entire nation and sacrifice to the end, and there is no reason to stop and compromise midway." The compromise in the "January 28th" War gave Japan time to recuperate and prepare for further aggression. In the five years after the signing of the Shanghai Truce Agreement, Japan was actively preparing for war and spared no effort, constantly seeking opportunities to engage in further aggression against China. Thus, the Lugouqiao Incident was launched two years ago on "July 7th," and the Shanghai Truce Agreement signed by itself was torn up on "August 23rd" in order to achieve its long-planned goal of annexing China.

China learned many lessons from the "January 28th" War and deeply understood that it was not enough to eliminate Japanese aggression and seek the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation without the unity of all parties and factions working together to resist Japan. Therefore, since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the whole of China, under the unified leadership of Chairman Chiang, launched a full-scale war of resistance, and the whole of China formed an unprecedentedly great anti-Japanese national united front.

Now, the War of Resistance has been going on for eighteen months, and the Japanese army has been trapped in a dilemma. It also knows deeply that today's China is not comparable to the China of seven years ago. Seven years ago, it could use the internal friction in China to carry out the strategy of defeating them individually in order to fulfill its dream of destroying China. Now, China has formed an unprecedentedly great anti-Japanese national united front, mobilizing the manpower, financial resources, and material resources of the whole country to contend with the Japanese aggression. Japan mobilized millions of troops, fought for a year and a half, and spent 900 million yen, but still could not find a solution, and was getting deeper and deeper like stepping into a quagmire. Chairman Chiang has elaborated on this point in his address to the Fifth Plenary Session. Therefore, now China only needs to be able to firmly believe in the war of resistance, not compromise midway, and fight more and more bravely, and the final victory will be only a matter of time. Because military aggression has no hope of success, Japan, with its sun setting, has to use its political conspiracies in an attempt to divide China's anti-Japanese united front by means of instigation and discord in order to find a slight way out of its desperate situation. But the Chinese nation had already learned lessons and gained experience in the "January 28th" War. Who does not know that in order to achieve the ultimate goal of victory, we must resolutely resist the war to the end, unanimously support the National Government, support Chairman Chiang, and support the anti-Japanese united front; and shatter any conspiracies by Japan that are detrimental to the National Government, Chairman Chiang, and the anti-Japanese united front? Therefore, although the result of the "January 28th" War was a failure, it laid the foundation for the future final victory of China's War of Resistance against Japan.

The people of Shanghai have always been eager to participate in the patriotic salvation movement. In the past, during the "January 28th" and "August 13th" incidents, they participated in the War of Resistance very enthusiastically, both directly and indirectly. After the Chinese army withdrew to the west, although many patriots were limited by the environment of the isolated island and could not freely express their patriotism as in the past, they still engaged in patriotic salvation movements within the possible scope, which benefited the country to some extent. Now, on the seventh anniversary of "January 28th," we hope that the Chinese people on the isolated island will, in the spirit of patriotism in the past, engage more actively in the patriotic salvation movement in addition to charity sales and donations, so that they will be worthy of the martyrs who died in the "January 28th" War and the War of Resistance since "August 13th"!

### Roger, a Specialist from the Bank of England, Returns Home to Negotiate Loans to China with the Authorities

He Will Also Submit a Report on China's Financial Situation; London Circles Concerned About the Issue of Foreign Debt Repayment

(London) Roger, a specialist from the Bank of England who previously accompanied Sir Leith-Ross, an economic advisor to the British government, to China, returned here from China today. Roger told people that he could not make any comments. However, it is reported that Roger is now working on preparing a detailed report on China's finances and will discuss everything with Leith-Ross, Norman, the president of the Bank of England, and the Export Credits Guarantee Department. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)

(London) Here, all circles are still closely studying the issue of China's continued repayment of customs debt. Although they are confident that China will agree to find a way to repay it, they feel that there is a need to repay it as soon as possible in order to clarify the atmosphere and pave the way for foreigners to assist China in lending and borrowing. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)

(Washington) According to Democratic Congressman Suffin today, Japan's actions to abandon the Nine-Power Treaty have opened the door for the United States to strengthen the first line of defense in the Pacific. The Nine-Power Treaty was a condition for the United States to limit its naval armaments. Now that Japan has abandoned the Nine-Power Treaty and violated the agreement by setting up defense industries under trusteeship, the United States is no longer restricted and can freely set up any defense facilities. The government's proposal to build key naval bases is the most important of the cases that the Maritime Affairs Committee wants to discuss in this session. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)

(Tokyo) According to today's "Kokumin Shimbun," Japan has decided to risk everything and engage in a "head-on collision" with Britain in the Far East in retaliation for Britain's interference in Japan's East Asian policy. The newspaper said that Japan's recent protests to London and Singapore over the arrest of eight Japanese businessmen in Singapore on suspicion of espionage are the first step in Japan's determination to risk a head-on conflict with Britain. Britain has finally revealed its interference in Japan's China policy and its intention to act against Japan. Therefore, Japan should immediately abolish the Nine-Power Treaty, protect the demands of the "New Chinese Government," abolish consular jurisdiction, and return Hong Kong to China.

### 于斌主教在歐談　中國民氣發皇

Bishop Yu Bin Speaks in Europe: Chinese National Spirit Flourishes

財政基礎亦穩固　各國應見義勇為

Financial Foundation is Also Solid; All Nations Should Act Righteously and Courageously

(Paris) Bishop Yu Bin of the Nanjing Region of China recently gave a speech to various newspapers, explaining the progress of China's resistance and national construction. He stated, "The Chinese people's sense of awakening is advancing more rapidly than before. The people support their leader even more enthusiastically. The army's combat experience is becoming richer, and the financial foundation is also becoming more stable. At the same time, foreign countries have a clearer understanding of Japan's intentions and a more thorough understanding of the Far East issue. As for the flourishing of the Chinese national spirit, it can be seen from the unanimous counterattack of the entire nation when Wang Jingwei defected. Wang Jingwei was originally an important figure in the Kuomintang, second only to General Chiang Kai-shek in status. He believed that after his proposal for peace, he would have considerable power to rally the majority of the people. Unexpectedly, the opposite happened. And General Chiang Kai-shek, in his speech on December 26th of last year, refuted the declaration of the former Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe item by item, refusing to accept various threats. People across the country followed suit, and the national spirit became even more vibrant. Furthermore, regarding the Chinese army, although it has undergone a year and a half of bitter fighting, its morale remains as strong as ever. In the early stages of the war, the ratio of casualties between China and Japan was three to one. Recently, it has changed to eight to ten, so the war situation is more favorable to China. The Chinese army originally had 140 divisions, each with 10,000 men, but now it has increased to 200 divisions, and there are 4 million guerrillas, whose supplies are not entirely borne by the national treasury." As for the battle lines of the two armies, they have now advanced to the mountainous areas, where the terrain is rugged and Japanese tanks can no longer be used. As for air bombing, only the cities are easily poisoned. "In the past, the battle lines were long, and our country had to set up defenses against the enemy in many places. Now, the war situation has changed greatly. The isolated enemy is deeply entrenched, uneasy. Our country can launch attacks at any time, encircle and suppress them, and force them to exhaustion. The famous French general Marshal Foch said, "War is merely a struggle between two wills." At this moment, the Japanese army's will has been severely tested. Every place they gain only increases their difficulties and pain. Therefore, there are frequent reports of Japanese soldiers committing suicide due to war fatigue. We cannot help but feel pity for these people." The extremely solid financial foundation of China goes without saying. On the other hand, looking at the situation in Japan, not only has the false reputation of the Japanese army's constant victories been proven incorrect by the facts and witnessed and heard by all countries, but also the country's financial difficulties are known to everyone. For example, the amount of national debt has increased by 120,000,000,000 francs in the last 18 months alone. This one example is indicative of the rest. The country's steps to invade China were based on the Tanaka Memorial as the blueprint. The method was to first establish the so-called new order in China and then expand it outside of China. Konoe Fumimaro and Hachiro Arita, based on the Tanaka Memorial, proclaimed the new order while conquering all of China and completely excluding the interests protected by foreign countries. The United Kingdom, France, and the United States have all realized this. Recalling that a year ago, the world still laughed at this legend. Today, everyone is enlightened and knows that it is not false. In Japan, more than half of the residents of each city and the villagers who were destroyed hate war. Most intellectuals are labeled as communists and thrown into prison. In short, the Japanese warlords bear a heavy responsibility to the people and will eventually collapse under the burden. The entire country of Japan may perish together." Looking around the world, each country has its own history of hardship and pain, but none is as severe as our country's. Hundreds of millions of lives have been lost. Although the refugee relief committee is responsible for relief, the situation is difficult and their strength is insufficient. We must expect foreign aid. Fortunately, the general situation in the Far East, the significance of the Sino-Japanese War, and how to resolve it are known to the world. Our country is in the position of an invaded country and will eventually win. This is also foreseen by insightful people. What must be paid attention to is that empty words are of no help. Only practical actions can be effective. Conversely, any action, whether direct or indirect, that is sufficient to economically and financially assist China's executioners should be avoided as if it were mud. The responsibility that China is now fulfilling is both national and international. After understanding the crux of the matter, how long will it take for each country to take action?" Bishop Yu Bin's eloquence was flowing. His conclusion was, "The Christian church cannot remain silent in the face of this unprecedented catastrophe. Its meaning is no different from the fact that all countries and individuals cannot stand idly by. Originally, under certain circumstances, maintaining neutrality may be possible or necessary, but the morality of Christianity and the natural morality of the universe are also actively acting. Our preparation to fulfill our responsibilities is that if we cannot act righteously and courageously, we cannot repent in the world. This is also intolerable to the principles of nature. Can we say that we will be exempt from God's judgment in the future? As for countries that evade their responsibilities, they will eventually suffer disadvantages. The material and spiritual assets that they are concerned about will eventually be attacked. The way of God is consistent throughout the ages. It can be asserted that the justice and kindness presided over by God will win. (Havas Telegram, 27th)

### 西南行營發表　西戰局

Southwestern Theater Headquarters Announces Situation in the Western Theater

桂林 The Southwestern Theater Headquarters today announced the situation in the southwestern theater as follows:

(1) The Japanese army in the southern Anhui area is weak in strength. The Chinese guerrillas are increasingly active and expanding their influence. They use the tactics of resilience to avoid the real and attack the weak, making the Japanese army unable to defend against them. The troops of the Chinese army who captured Qingyang launched attacks in three directions again on the morning of the 20th. Two routes searched and advanced to the northwest of Qingyang, and one route attacked from the north side of Qingyang. The Japanese troops were dispersed and unable to respond to each other, making it easy to break them down one by one.

(2) In the Jiangsu-Zhejiang area, the Chinese guerrillas lurking in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have also recently responded to the guerrillas in various war zones and are active in all directions. A strong unit has advanced to Hangzhou to attack. The Japanese army is stubbornly resisting in the city. The Chinese army is now launching a general attack together with the regular army and local defense forces. A unit has advanced to the vicinity of □□□□.

(3) In the Zengcheng area, on the morning of the 15th, 500 to 600 Japanese infantrymen, with several artillery pieces, fiercely attacked China. The Chinese army resisted with all its strength. After four hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army suffered more than half of its casualties and finally retreated to Zengcheng.

(4) In the Conghua area, at dawn on the 13th, a certain unit of the Chinese army counterattacked Jindong and Shuangfeng Mountain. At the same time, a unit was sent to quickly attack Shengang. The Japanese army was attacked on its flanks and stubbornly resisted. After fierce fighting until noon, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed. The remaining Japanese soldiers could not hold out and fled to Taipingchang. China immediately pursued them. At present, the vanguard unit has advanced to the vicinity of □□□. On the same day, another unit of more than 400 Japanese soldiers came into contact with the Chinese army at Gao'ao Peak. The battle was extremely fierce. Soon, the Japanese army successively increased its infantry by more than 700, with an artillery platoon attached. The Chinese army, due to the disparity in numbers, retreated to the advantageous terrain in the □□□ area. That night, the Chinese army launched a night attack on the Japanese army. The Japanese army initially resisted stubbornly, but by dawn, they could not hold out and retreated. In total, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed. The Chinese side also suffered some losses.

(5) In the Huaxian area, on the morning of the 14th, more than 500 Japanese soldiers suddenly launched a fierce attack on the Ping Shan and Liang Longluo positions. The Chinese defenders bravely fought back and held out for half a day. The Japanese army's offensive was frustrated. Soon, they increased their reinforcements by more than 800 and used aircraft to assist in the battle. At that time, the Chinese army retreated to the established positions on the first line because the artillery fire was fierce and the positions were almost completely destroyed. At noon on the 18th, the Japanese army increased its troops by another thousand, with more than ten tanks attached, and advanced northward. The Chinese army temporarily retreated to hold the key points. The Japanese army went deep into the area and waited for an opportunity to attack. The Japanese army in Juntian once attacked westward, but was intercepted by the Chinese Self-Defense Corps and routed. They all fled to Chini Market.

(6) In the Yueyang area, the Chinese guerrillas near Yueyang and along the railway line are extremely active. The Japanese army is having difficulty coping and is trying to shorten the battle line and hold on to the strongholds. On the 19th, a certain unit of the Chinese guerrillas attacked the Japanese army in Yueyang and once rushed into the East Gate and engaged in close combat with the Japanese army. However, due to the Japanese army's superior firepower and the completion of the mission, the Chinese army retreated to the suburbs to guard. The Japanese army did not dare to rashly leave the city. On the 20th, three Japanese motorboats were discovered near Huarong, attempting to cross Dongting Lake to create disturbances. They were discovered by the Chinese defenders and were severely attacked, but they did not succeed.

(7) In the Yongxiu area, the main force of the Japanese army in western Jiangxi, except for a small number of troops stationed in Baicha, Zhuxi, and Qiujin, is stationed between De'an and Yangxin. The Japanese army on the north bank of the Xiu River are constantly firing artillery shells at the south bank, with the intention of bluffing and intimidating. A certain unit of the Chinese guerrillas is destroying the Japanese army's transportation near the Nanxun Line. The Japanese army is intensifying the construction of fortifications and barbed wire along the railway line in an attempt to block the actions of the Chinese guerrillas. (Telegram, 26th)

### 緬甸港滇問　直達航空

Direct Aviation Between Burma, Hong Kong, and Yunnan

國府與帝航公司訂定業務上協定

The National Government and Imperial Airways Company Sign a Business Agreement

(Chongqing) The National Government and the British Imperial Airways Company have signed an agreement on direct passenger and mail aviation services between Burma, Hong Kong, and Yunnan, which is welcomed by all sectors of the Chinese community here. Ta Kung Pao published an editorial today, saying, "We welcome this news. We hope it will be realized soon, as this new measure will enhance friendship between China and European countries and contribute to the development of the Chinese interior. We are prepared to cooperate with any international peaceful undertaking. What we oppose is only ambition and aggression." (Reuters Telegram, 27th)

(Chongqing) According to sources in the aviation industry, in the near future, Chongqing to London can be reached in five days. Kong Xiangxi said a few days ago that the Chinese government and British Royal Airways have signed a contract, and all procedures will be completed soon, and shipping will begin. Regarding the preliminary negotiations between the Chinese and Soviet authorities on an air route over northwestern China to facilitate transportation between Moscow and Chongqing, officials have not yet confirmed it. However, according to aviation personnel, flying between Chongqing and Moscow, with the assistance of night flight equipment, can be reached in 40 hours. However, this kind of flight is probably impossible in reality. Recalling that five years ago, the Eurasia Aviation Company planned to open a route between Shanghai and Tacheng, Xinjiang. Although the test flights were successful, they ultimately failed to be realized. The Eurasia Company is still planning to open a route from Chongqing to Tacheng via Dihua. If this plan can be realized, the company plans to use all Chinese pilots, because their driving skills are now very proficient. At present, the German Junkers aircraft traveling between Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Suzhou are all driven by Chinese pilots, which proves the reliability of Chinese pilots. These Chinese pilots were previously co-pilots, helping foreign pilots to drive. After the Eurasia Company's plan is realized, it can connect with the Sino-Soviet air route, but it is not yet known when this matter will be realized. (Associated Press Telegram, 27th)

### 蘇省村　疏導黃河

Dredging the Yellow River in Jiangsu Province

(Huaiyin) In order to drain the Yellow River water, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has now started dredging the sea channels in the Lixia River area and has requested the central government to subsidize the construction costs. It recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the 22nd, stating that the dredging project is crucial and allocated 100,000 yuan. Wu Zhihui, Chen Guofu, Niu Yongjian, Huang Yanpei, and others also telegraphed the provincial government, saying that since there is no way to block the Yellow River, they should rush to do the dredging project. The provincial government has now requisitioned 10,000 civilians for the 800-zhang diversion canal project in Maochi River and has begun digging. (Telegram, 27th)

All residents in the disaster areas are exempt from unpaid land taxes. (Telegram, 27th)

### 華準備開發西北　農田水利

China Prepares to Develop Northwest Agriculture and Water Conservancy

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, in addition to fully developing the economic construction in the Southwest, the central government has also allocated huge sums of money to handle the economic construction in the Northwest. A few days ago, Wang Yujun, chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee, and Chen Ruling, director of the River Defense Office, came to Chongqing to visit the central authorities and make a statement. The central government has become more active in the economic construction of the Northwest. Recently, Shaanxi and Gansu will be developed first for farmland and water conservancy. However, this project is extremely huge and cannot be done without a complete plan. Therefore, Wang Yujun was ordered to be responsible for the investigation and prepare a plan, and then develop farmland and water conservancy in Shaanxi and Gansu.

(Washington) President Roosevelt and State Department officials have recently consulted with the principal ambassadors from four countries many times, and it can be predicted that the US government is preparing to take action on the new world crisis in the spring or summer of this year. Ambassador to the UK Kennedy, Ambassador to Germany Wilson, Ambassador to Italy Phillips, Ambassador to France Bullitt, when talking with anyone here, all expressed that there will be a new crisis in Europe this year. Their words are conclusive, leaving no doubt. No matter in what way the new disputes of the future arise, the president will resolutely maintain peace, as he did last year. This is predictable and without doubt. However, there are two things that the president cannot do: one is not to use force, and the other is not to put himself in the position of assisting aggressors to seize through negotiation what they threaten to seize by force. The US government also cannot engage in mediation to allow threats of war to allow the lands of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Belgium to be ceded to Germany and Italy. What the US government can do, and what Congress is willing to do if it amends the Neutrality Act in a timely manner, is to provide spiritual and economic assistance to the invaded countries. The president's position is, of course, not to endorse a situation created by force anywhere outside the Western Hemisphere. Most people think the president is now considering whether the country will be dragged into the vortex of war in a few years. If so, the military buildup program he recently submitted to Congress is fundamentally too small. However, judging from the president's speech to the new Congress, it is clear that the president hopes that the aggressors will understand that the United States intends to provide economic assistance to any aggressor and that war can be averted this year. Even if the United States were to fall into war, most people believe, even believe, that the United States need not, as in 1918, send a large army overseas to participate in the war. Modern warfare is completely unsuitable for war and can be based entirely on a "volunteer" basis, as Germany and Italy did in Spain. Therefore, most people believe that the United States can provide all assistance to help its allied countries, such as supplying bullets, airplanes, gasoline, etc. If the American people wish to go overseas to participate in the war, they can be allowed to go and join the war. If the form of the war is fascism versus democracy, then the number of American people willing to join the side of democracy will undoubtedly be large. In the Spanish Civil War, although the US authorities prevented the people from going to join the war, thousands still joined the government army. If permitted by the government, the number would undoubtedly be far greater. (Reuters Telegram, 27th)

(Washington) After the news of the fall of Barcelona, Spain, reached here, American political figures said that the Nationalists' troops and equipment were far superior to those of the government army, and the fall of Barcelona was inevitable. Now that the prestige of the totalitarian countries has been greatly enhanced by the Nationalists' victory, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will inevitably take an offensive approach to France in diplomacy. According to reports obtained here, Germany is likely to support Italy's various demands on France. American newspapers generally expect Italy to exert pressure on France again in the near future. As for the United States, the proposal to rescind the order prohibiting the shipment of munitions to the Spanish Republic has been shelved. The State Department believes that this move would only add complications to the governments of Britain and France under the current circumstances. In addition, well-informed observers declare that American public opinion is still opposed to the outward expansion of the power of the dictatorships, and it is closely watching the attitude of Britain and France. It is generally believed that appeasement policies at this time will only aggravate the tense situation, and only the implementation of resolute policies will do. As for French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet, when they delivered speeches in the Chamber of Deputies today, they strongly stated that the country would not make any concessions under the threat of force. The American side praised them with sympathy. (Havas Telegram, 26th)

(Washington) It is rumored that senior legal advisors have told President Roosevelt not to lift the ban on shipping munitions to Spain unless specifically instructed by Congress. It is rumored that President Roosevelt himself believes that the chances of the Spanish government army winning are extremely slim. (Associated Press Telegram, 26th)

Foreign Minister Bonnet's meeting with Ambassador Surits today is actually related to this matter. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, the German government does not intend to send a formal business delegation to Moscow at this time, but Schnurre, a senior official in the Commercial Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will soon go to the Soviet capital for observation and exploration, which is the actual situation.

(London) Well-informed sources here recently declared that Germany is now located between the two countries and the Soviet Union, forming a group of neutral countries. It is said that the country's position in Eastern Europe has become very stable, and it has immediately gained an advantage in Western Europe. At the same time, it also wants to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union to exchange its industrial products for Soviet raw materials and food. It is reported that a German economic delegation will go to Moscow next week to discuss this matter. (According to reports, Poland and the Soviet Union are also conducting negotiations, intending to establish a similar agreement to promote trade between the two sides.) In short, Germany's intention is to hope that Poland will maintain neutrality on the one hand, and to promote business with the Soviet Union on the other hand, so that there will be no more worries in Eastern Europe. The country's Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's trip to Warsaw is intended to persuade Poland that it is only beneficial to maintain friendship with Germany, and to strive to declare that Germany has no intention of supporting the Ukrainian people's demand for independence in the coming years, in order to appease the Polish people. (Havas Telegram, 26th)

### German Foreign Minister's Visit to Poland: Joint Communiqué Issued

(Berlin) Regarding Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Poland, an official communiqué has been released stating that prior to the visit, the Foreign Minister and Polish Colonel Beck discussed various issues of concern to both nations, as well as the international situation, and affirmed the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact as the foundation for friendly discussions. Both sides agreed to seek solutions to all current and future issues within the framework of the agreement, and recognized that mutual cooperation would not only promote bilateral relations but also greatly benefit European peace. The significance of this can be confirmed by these talks. (Havas, 27th)

Warsaw: The official statement regarding German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Warsaw was released this afternoon. It first reviewed the visit of Polish Foreign Minister Beck to Germany in 1935 and the reciprocal visit by the German Foreign Minister. It then stated that yesterday afternoon, Ribbentrop and Beck held lengthy discussions, covering a wide range of topics. They also exchanged views on the broader international political landscape. Based on the German-Polish agreement of January 26, 1934, both sides frankly and openly expressed their opinions regarding their respective foreign policies. They also agreed that future solutions to issues of common interest would be based on safeguarding each other's legitimate interests. The smooth and friendly nature of the meeting between the two Foreign Ministers demonstrated that five years of cultivating cooperation had yielded positive results. (Reuter, 27th)

Warsaw: Regarding the talks between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Foreign Minister Beck, the official statement released today outlined the main achievements of these talks, namely, the reaffirmation of the overall value of the 1934 Non-Aggression Pact. Therefore, bilateral relations should continue to be based on this agreement. Local political figures viewed this as a satisfactory conclusion. Currently, Germany has no grievances against Poland, and Poland has no fears of Germany. However, unresolved issues remain. While Germany and Poland have a Non-Aggression Pact, Germany does not consider the current border to be stabilized by this agreement. Furthermore, the legal status of the Free City of Danzig remains a point of contention between the two sides. Finally, the issue of Polish minorities in Germany and German minorities in Poland often causes friction. However, it is reassuring that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit has demonstrated that Germany has no intention of exacerbating the current situation. Although no special agreement was reached after the talks between the two ministers, it has been confirmed that economic experts from both countries will continue discussions to develop bilateral trade relations. In addition, the talks touched on the Ukrainian issue, but it was not of primary importance. The Polish side emphasized that the Ukrainian population within the country is not dense enough to constitute a so-called minority. The difficulties related to the Ukrainian ethnic group are purely internal Polish matters and should be handled solely by Poland, without any reason for Germany to interfere. Aside from this, two other points are worth noting: (1) Previous rumors that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop carried a private letter from Hitler, ready to present it to President Mościcki, have been proven false. (2) The German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact is due to expire in 1944, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop did not propose extending the term of this agreement during his visit. (Havas, 27th)

Outlook on the European Situation

### Italy Mobilizes Troops: Britain Raises Questions; Italian Authorities Claim No Political Significance; France Opposes Convening Four-Power Conference; Hitler and Chamberlain to Deliver Speeches

(Rome) After the Italian government called up a batch of 60,000 reservists from the 1901 class, it is rumored that the government intends to call up the remaining members of that class, as well as the 1902 class, for military service. At the same time, all young people in the country belonging to special army units will also be conscripted. (Havas, 26th)

(London) The Times diplomatic correspondent reports that the British Embassy in Rome has inquired about the meaning of the Italian government's recent mobilization of 60,000 reservists from the 1901 class. London considers it unusual that the Italian government has concentrated Fascist militias around Rome and is also mobilizing reservists. The Italian government replied that the move was purely for training purposes. (Reuters, 27th)

(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that while the British government has not made any specific inquiries regarding Italy's mobilization of 1901 class reservists, the Italian government has informed the British government that the move is for administrative reasons, not political ones. (Reuters, 27th)

(Paris) How to resolve Italy's various demands is a major question at present. According to well-informed sources here, the French government is unwilling to convene a four-power conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, as was done in Munich, to seek a solution. While Foreign Minister Bonnet and Prime Minister Daladier expressed the intention to convene an international conference when delivering speeches in the National Assembly yesterday, their intention was to resolve all issues involving relevant countries, which should not be confused with a four-power conference. However, German newspapers are taking the opportunity to attach their own interpretations, claiming that French officials have agreed to the idea of a four-power conference, which is not true. According to news from Rome, the Italian government will propose convening such a conference in the short term. France, on the other hand, refuses to recognize Italy's unilateral abrogation of the 1935 agreement. The only acceptable approach for France is to engage in direct talks with Italy, rather than submitting this dispute to any conference for discussion. (Havas, 27th)

(Berlin) The National Assembly is scheduled to convene on Monday. Members have received notification today. The number of members attending will reach 855, including 73 Austrians and 41 Sudeten Germans, a scale unprecedented. 600 seats have been reserved for spectators. According to reports, after January 30, the world will better understand the gratitude owed to Germany and Italy. (Reuters, 27th)

(London) German leader Hitler is scheduled to deliver a speech to the National Assembly on the 30th of this month. There is much speculation about its content. According to the Financial Times, it is rumored that Hitler will demand the restoration of former colonies and the return of reparations paid by Germany to the Allied nations after the European War. (Havas, 27th)

(London) The Cabinet held a small meeting today to discuss the international situation. Political figures attach great importance to this. It is reported that when the House of Commons convenes on the 31st of this month, Prime Minister Chamberlain will first put the current foreign policy up for discussion and deliver a speech explaining his recent trip to Rome. Opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee will also express his views on the Spanish issue. (Havas, 26th)

### French Foreign Minister Announces Determination to Maintain Territorial Integrity, Abide by Non-Intervention Policy in Spain, but Will Not Allow Other Countries to Harm Interests; National Assembly Immediately Passes Vote of Confidence

(Paris) The National Assembly continued its discussion of foreign policy today. Foreign Minister Bonnet and Prime Minister Daladier successively delivered important speeches. The government party, the Radical Socialist Party, immediately proposed a motion endorsing the government's statement and expressing confidence that the government will take appropriate precautions to maintain the integrity of the French Empire and the security of transportation between France and its territories. Opposition parties sought to amend the wording of the motion, but the government immediately rejected the amendments and proposed a vote of confidence. The National Assembly ultimately expressed its confidence with a large majority of 360 votes to 234, and subsequently passed the motion by a show of hands. (Havas, 26th)

(Paris) After an important debate last night, the National Assembly passed a vote of confidence in the government by a vote of 364 to 232. During the debate, Foreign Minister Bonnet spoke, declaring that France is determined to continue its policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, but will not tolerate foreign interference with French interests in Spain or with French communications with North Africa. Britain and France have recently held talks to harmonize their policies on various aspects. In the event of war, the two countries will assist each other. During Bonnet's speech, Communist members attempted to disrupt the assembly once or twice. Outside the assembly, hundreds of women and children held demonstrations against war and Fascism. Nine female demonstrators were arrested. Prominent British politician Winston Churchill was in the audience of the assembly, listening to the debate. After the debate, Churchill entered the members' lounge and spoke with cabinet members and other members. (Reuters, 27th)

(Paris) When explaining foreign policy to the National Assembly this afternoon, Foreign Minister Bonnet touched on the situation in the Far East, saying, "General Chiang Kai-shek of China is leading his troops in a heroic resistance to maintain national independence and territorial integrity. The French government is closely monitoring this. Our representatives and nationals in China are sparing no effort to alleviate the suffering of the ordinary Chinese people. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have been rescued as a result. Our ambassador to Japan, Henri, has recently been instructed to present a note to the Japanese government, reserving all French rights, as the governments of Britain and the United States have done. In short, the position of Britain, the United States, and France in the Far East is based on the 1922 Washington Nine-Power Treaty. This has been the case in the past and will continue to be the case in the future. This is what the governments of the three countries have always believed." (Havas, 26th)

### French National Assembly Discusses Foreign Policy: Authorities Announce Policy; Close Relations with Britain, the United States, Russia, and Poland; Can be Guiltless Regarding Italy

(Paris) Foreign Minister Bonnet delivered an important speech to the National Assembly this afternoon, first explaining the seriousness of the current situation and reviewing the situation prior to the Munich Agreement in September of last year. The French government had repeatedly informed the Czechoslovak government that if the German minority in the Sudeten region were to demand a referendum, France would not use military force to prevent it. This concerns the value of friendship between Britain and France. "France's current policy is based on this friendship, and the relationship of mutual consultation has never been as close as it is today." If Britain is attacked, France will provide assistance with all its forces, just as Britain would assist France with all its forces if France were attacked. Regarding the declaration of peace issued by France and Germany on December 6 of last year, "I believe that anyone with a sense of responsibility, if placed in the same position, would find it difficult to refuse to sign." (Members of the right-wing parties applauded.) This declaration is the first step towards peaceful cooperation, and it can be asserted that if the people of this country were to hold a referendum, they would definitely fully support the policy we are pursuing. As for the relationship between France and Italy, we have made many efforts in the past to improve bilateral relations, but after Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered an anti-French speech in Genoa on May 15 of last year, these efforts came to a halt. Later, after the Munich Agreement was concluded, the French government appointed [blank] as ambassador to Italy and recognized the Italian Empire. According to the ambassador, the issue of Spain is the only obstacle to improving relations between France and Italy. Towards the end of November of last year, certain members of the Italian parliament suddenly made anti-French statements, expressing views on certain regions of France. After the French government made representations, the Italian government immediately replied that these were the actions of individual members and that they could not be held responsible. The French government did not accept this statement. Furthermore, the note presented by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to French Ambassador Ponsot (declaring the abrogation of the Franco-Italian agreement of January 7, 1935) listed various arguments, which France also refused to accept. Britain fully supports France's position. "In short, based on all the facts, France can truly be guiltless. The position of France, as Prime Minister Daladier and I have stated again and again, is clear and unambiguous and must be maintained. What is that position? The French colonial empire was created through the blood and toil of France and must be maintained in its entirety. It will not allow other countries to harm it." Regarding France's relations with the Soviet Union and Poland, France has repeatedly consulted with the governments of those countries. "Our country still maintains traditional friendship with Poland, and the Polish government has recently reaffirmed that friendship with France is one of the main bases of current policy." "In short, the obligations our country has accepted towards the Soviet Union and Poland still exist and will naturally be implemented in accordance with the spirit on which these obligations were based." Regarding the relations between France and the United States, we have already felt that American public opinion is drawing closer to us, and the friendship between our two countries is very harmonious, which is gratifying. We admire President Roosevelt's high prestige. Foreign Minister Bonnet then expressed his sympathy for the refugees from various countries and said, "Although we have made great efforts to maintain peace, there are still two centers of conflict in the world, namely the Far East and Spain." Then, after touching on the situation in the Far East, Foreign Minister Bonnet generally discussed the Spanish problem, stating briefly that former Prime Minister Blum had said that if France wanted to help the Spanish Republican government, abolishing the non-intervention agreement would not be enough; it would be necessary to send troops and supplies of arms to achieve results. "This is something no one wants." British Labour Party leader Major Attlee has requested an early convening of parliament to discuss the issue of assisting the Spanish government forces, but Prime Minister Chamberlain has refused and decided to continue pursuing a policy of non-intervention. The attitudes of the British and French governments are identical. France, based on humanitarian principles, has provided Spain with wheat worth 40 million francs and has taken in more than 11,000 Spanish refugees. At that time, a certain Communist member was insulting Foreign Minister Bonnet, and the National Assembly was adjourned for a moment. After the meeting resumed, Bonnet continued his speech, saying, "The current government is determined to continue pursuing a policy of non-intervention," but "it is also true that humanitarianism has new responsibilities that must be fulfilled. I have told Spanish Republican Foreign Minister Alvarez del Vayo that we are willing to accept a large number of Spanish women, children, and elderly refugees who seek refuge in France. Regarding this issue, we might as well establish a neutral zone to settle them." "In short, our country also has various interests that must be maintained, and we will not allow foreign countries to threaten the territorial integrity of Spain, thereby threatening our security. The British government also seeks to maintain the territorial integrity of Spain, and the Italian government has stated that it is determined to fulfill the Anglo-Italian agreement and withdraw volunteers from Spain. France attaches great importance to this statement, because we cannot allow foreigners to occupy mainland Spain or Spanish Morocco, thereby threatening our communications with North Africa." In conclusion, the idea of convening an international conference to discuss the issue of peaceful organization can be accepted by France in principle, but at the same time, it is prepared for any eventuality and can handle any situation with ease. (Havas, 26th)

(Paris) When announcing France's policy on Spain, Bonnet said, "We believe that the solution to the Spanish issue is a matter for the Spanish people themselves and should not be interfered with by others. Anyone who values good faith would not openly criticize the policy of non-intervention, and no country dares to take responsibility for criticizing this policy. British Foreign Secretary Halifax said in Geneva that the British government considers the maintenance of the Anglo-Italian agreement to be extremely important, and we have also informed him of France's point of view. British politicians fully understand us. Britain's attitude is extremely loyal. If France's communications with North Africa are threatened by foreign troops in Spain or on Spanish islands, we cannot tolerate it. France has various interests in Spain, and we cannot allow any country to interfere in Spanish affairs in a way that endangers the integrity of France. The Nationalist government must declare that it will not allow any foreign country to occupy its territory. The British possessions of Malta and Gibraltar are also threatened by the situation in Spain. Therefore, it can be said with certainty that the British and French positions are completely consistent on this issue. The arms race will bankrupt Europe or lead to war. If the proposal to convene a disarmament conference receives the necessary support, the French government is prepared to convene an international conference. In short, France has regained its strength and will not abandon its responsibilities. Those abroad who expect France to decline will only be disappointed." After Bonnet finished speaking, members from the right and left wings and from the central parties all stood up and cheered for him. (Reuters, 27th)

(Paris) The National Assembly discussed foreign policy this afternoon. Prime Minister Daladier spoke after Socialist Party leader and former Prime Minister Blum, to conclude the debate, saying, "The evolution of the situation is extremely rapid. For the sake of the national interest, the people of France must unite under the guidance of the government." "War is the greatest madness. All members of our National Assembly have declared that France is committed to peace. Mr. Blum has also proposed convening an international conference to condemn war, which I fully support." "If France takes the lead in this matter, it would truly be France's glory." Then, the Prime Minister touched on Italy's various demands on France, stating, "Anywhere that involves French interests, if anyone tries to covet it, France will directly and unequivocally reject it. There have been endless insults from the Italian side against France. We have always responded calmly. France, because of its strength, can ignore these insults. Moreover, I personally have a deep impression of the value of the Italian people during the European War, and I still cherish friendship with the Italian nation. In short, the integrity of French territory, the French North African Empire, the French overseas colonial empire, and even the freedom of French transportation, if anyone tries to hinder them, we cannot tolerate it." Amid the cheers of the members, Prime Minister Daladier declared, "The tasks ahead are extremely arduous. France, in order to protect the security of the Empire and all its ideals, must work together with one heart. Today's world is under the shadow of force. France is expanding its military in order to defend itself." (Havas, 26th)

When the National Assembly discussed foreign policy this afternoon, Socialist Party leader and former Prime Minister Blum delivered a speech, stating briefly, "I wish to convene an international conference. Conversely, bilateral talks are enough to lead to a crisis. Since the existence of the political axis between Germany and Italy, the distribution of power in Europe has been reorganized, and only Germany has benefited from it. Italy, in its anxiety, has also made demands. Germany cannot turn a blind eye to this." Regarding the Spanish issue, the non-intervention agreement seemed effective when it was established in 1936, but at this time, it has completely failed. "However, the government believes that it is beneficial to the interests of our country to continue to be bound by it. In fact, according to the current agreement between Britain and France, France can choose the best path for the common policy of Britain and France. British public opinion is now eagerly awaiting France to initiate something, so that it can follow suit." In short, the reason why Italy has not yet made demands on France is due to the resistance of the Spanish government forces. (Havas, 26th)

### Japan Plans to Appoint Tani Masayuki as Ambassador to France; French Government Disagrees

A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry announced today that the Japanese government had previously sought French approval for the appointment of Tani Masayuki as ambassador to France, but the French government pointed out that Tani had made a statement to reporters last summer about France's assistance to China, and the French government did not want to agree because what he said was not in accordance with the facts. The Asahi Shimbun discussed the matter in detail today, saying that it was regrettable that Franco-Japanese relations had been clouded by France's unfriendly attitude. It believes that the Japanese government will also follow France's lead and not agree to the appointment of a successor to the current French ambassador Henri after he returns home. Japan has been seeking French approval for Tani's appointment for seven weeks now, and despite repeated urging from the Japanese government, the French side has not changed its strategy of delay. The reason the French government disagrees with Tani is said to be that Tani's concepts and actions are not very friendly to France. In fact, the real reason for this is France's policy toward Japan, and it has nothing to do with Tani personally. The newspaper also mentioned France's attitude at the recent League of Nations meeting, saying that France has always adopted an anti-Japanese policy. (Reuters, 27th)

### Japanese Military Dissatisfied with Hiranuma

(Tokyo) Well-informed sources here are saying that since the Hiranuma cabinet was established, it has coincided with the period of parliamentary sessions, and members of various political parties have been raising questions one after another. The military believes that it is inappropriate for the parties to fail to remain serious and calm during this time of war. However, the Hiranuma cabinet's tolerance of the parties' questions is also a sign of weakness, and therefore they are quite dissatisfied. (26th dispatch)

### The Spanish Nationalist Army Endeavors to Win Hearts, Distributes Food to Relieve the Starving, and Dispatches Troops to Pursue Government Forces

Barcelona: After the Nationalist army entered the city, trucks loaded with food arrived continuously to relieve the starving populace. Banners hung on the trucks boldly proclaimed "General Franco is selfless" and "The people shall be fed."

The new mayor, Mr. Madu, the general manager of a Spanish automobile company, immediately assigned civil defense forces and police to be stationed in various places to prevent looting after taking office. All cities controlled by the Nationalist army, upon hearing the news of the fall of Barcelona, rang bells to celebrate their victory, and the masses rejoiced. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

Burgos: The Nationalist army is currently advancing rapidly on all fronts in Catalonia. The government forces launched an offensive in Estremadura in an attempt to relieve the pressure on Barcelona, but according to Nationalist army claims, they are advancing in the area and have broken through multiple key points. In Valls and Esparraguera, where the government forces launched their last offensive, the Nationalist army has recaptured all lost ground in a counteroffensive and buried hundreds of abandoned government soldiers' corpses. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

Bébi: Today, Nationalist aircraft extensively bombed Barcelona and towns along the French border and dropped 400,000 leaflets in central Madrid, informing the residents there of the Nationalist army's capture of the Catalan capital.

(Reuter's dispatch, 26th)

Barcelona: According to a Havas reporter, starting at 4:00 PM yesterday, several squads of Nationalist army light tanks were the first to enter the city, speeding through the main streets. The vanguard unit, the "Balon Brigade," then entered the city. Residents along the way hung bed sheets and cloaks from their homes, using them as makeshift flags to show their welcome. Residents gathered in the streets, standing and watching, all cheering for the Nationalist army soldiers. Children even jumped onto the soldiers' shoulders or climbed onto the tanks. Within an hour and a half, the entire city was completely occupied by the Nationalist army. By dusk, soldiers were setting up camp on the streets, and civilians brought newspapers from the Republican government to burn for warmth. The firelight shone on the walls, creating flickering shadows, as if in a dance. In a certain square, some civilians burned newsstands, and nearby children threw various items into the fire, making the flames even more intense. Civilians sang patriotic songs by the fire, and children cheered in unison, their voices resounding far and wide. When officers issued orders, they had to first blow a trumpet to silence the crowd. The clamor at the time was quite a sight. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

### Government Forces Declare Continued Warfare, Most Important Figures Flee to France

According to news from Girona received by the Spanish news agency here, the government forces have secured a new line of defense north of Barcelona. Their withdrawal from Barcelona was because street fighting in the city, combined with close bombing by a large number of aircraft, would inevitably lead to an inhumane massacre of the residents. With very few exceptions, all able-bodied men in the city have been evacuated to the new line of defense. Only elderly men and women and children remain in the city. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

Girona: The Republican government issued an official announcement here, stating that the government forces withdrew from Barcelona without fighting to "the last man" due to strategic and humanitarian considerations. From a military standpoint, continuing to fight in Barcelona would isolate a portion of the elite troops from the main force and would also result in the loss of many important materials. Currently, the highest authorities of the government forces have constructed a new line of defense north of Catalonia, preparing to accumulate resources for continued resistance. The announcement also stated that all able-bodied men have retreated to the pre-built new line of defense, and only the elderly, women, and children remain in Barcelona. The announcement continued that if the government forces fought in the streets of Barcelona, bombing by Nationalist army aircraft would be unavoidable, and innocent civilians would suffer even more devastation. It was reported that when civilians evacuated from Barcelona, they were strafed by German and Italian aircraft, resulting in hundreds of deaths. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

Bébi: Figueres, where the Spanish Republican government is currently located, was bombed this morning. According to those who have taken refuge there, the town of Granollers, where refugees are gathered, was bombed by Nationalist army aircraft this morning, resulting in hundreds of deaths and causing great panic in the town. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

Bébi: Former Spanish Prime Minister Caballer and many important members of the Republican Party have entered the French border. France will allow two thousand refugees to enter France today. Spanish Foreign Minister Val will arrive in Perdus and then go to Figueres. Catalan President Companys and several government officials are currently near Figueres, in the Voló district. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

Barcelona: In the moments before the fall of the city and the change of flags, the circumstances were worth mentioning. According to French Consul-General Trémoulet, speaking to a Havas reporter, the main force of the government forces completely withdrew on the night of the 25th of this month, leaving only a small number of machine gun teams and several tanks to guard key points in the suburbs for cover. At that time, residents were aware that the main force had retreated and felt uneasy. Many people gathered in groups, calling for government relief. Some people, due to food shortages, forcibly entered several cooperatives to seize food to fill their hunger. However, the general population remained calm and composed. By noon on the 26th, residents were already preparing to welcome the Nationalist army into the city, and the last few government tanks passed through the city at 4:00 PM, heading northeast towards the city of Badalona. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Barcelona: A Havas reporter recently learned from personnel at the Ministry of Transportation that when the government forces withdrew from the city, they used 20,000 trucks to transport food, ammunition, clothing, and furniture. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

### The Italian People Celebrate the Spanish Nationalist Army's Victory with Enthusiasm

(Rome) Mussolini said that he has created a new page in European history. The masses echoed, shouting "Straight to Paris."

Prime Minister Mussolini spoke yesterday on the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia to thousands of people gathered in front of the palace in the rain, saying that General Franco's victory is welcomed not only by all cities in Spain that are far from the scourge of communism but also by anti-communists around the world. This glorious victory is a new page in the European history we have created. General Franco's troops and Italian expatriate troops have not only defeated the Negrin government of Spain but also defeated our other enemies. The crowd roared with applause upon hearing these words. When Mussolini said the words "we are creating European history," some in the crowd shouted "Straight to Paris," and many of the military officers attending Mussolini shouted "Tunis" and "Paris." All over Italy, people welcomed the fall of Barcelona and celebrated Italy's victory. The general atmosphere in Rome reminded people of the situation when the Italian army was victorious in Abyssinia. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini has received a telegram from General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, stating, "The Italian volunteer soldiers are brave and good at fighting. They made a great contribution to the capture of the city of Barcelona. I hereby express my gratitude by telegram." (Havas dispatch, 26th)

(London) Spanish nationals here recently gave a speech on the situation in their country, saying that after the fall of Barcelona, the situation in the civil war has changed. In the future, the situation can be reversed quickly. In other words, the monarchy will be restored, and a formal government will be formed according to regulations. The Nationalist government will send a secret envoy to notify the governments of Britain and France that General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army, will withdraw all foreign volunteers after the final victory. As for the restoration of the monarchy, it will not be by the return of the deposed King Alfonso XIII of Spain, but by the ascension of the throne by the deposed king's son, Prince Juan. Prince Juan has served in the British Navy. After he ascends the throne in the future, he can guarantee the territorial integrity of Spain to Britain and France. In addition, sources familiar with the news stated that Spanish Republican Ambassador to the United Kingdom Azcárate has been ordered to notify the British government that after the fall of Barcelona, the government forces will continue to fight in Catalonia. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Almost all of the money will be used to assist refugees. The interest rate has not yet been determined. Experts from Britain, France, and Czechoslovakia are scheduled to hold a meeting today to sign the agreement. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

Chongqing Newspaper Comments on the European Situation

(Chongqing) Today, all Chinese newspapers are writing extensively about the Nationalist army's capture of Barcelona, saying that this is the result of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy of non-intervention and the subsequent conclusion of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. Chinese circles generally have doubts about Mussolini's lack of territorial ambitions in Spain or his unwillingness to force France to accept demands for Italian colonies. The Chinese newspapers also stated that the future of Europe will largely be determined by General Franco's victory and the events that occur after the Meiji Restoration. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

### Bai Chongxi Inspects the Defense of Guangxi

Passing Through Liuzhou and Guixian, Increasing the Anti-Japanese War Strength

Guangxi Communication: The Japanese army invading Guangdong has recently dispatched a fleet to occupy Weizhou Island, threatening the areas of Qinlian and Beihai, and claiming to attack Wuzhou and Nanning in Guangxi. As a result, the defense of Guangxi Province has become more severe. In order to consolidate the national defense of Guangxi Province, Bai Chongxi returned to Guilin from Hunan on the fourth of last month and convened a meeting of the commanders and deputy commanders of the civil defense corps and the commanders of the divisions and brigades in the area, directly instructing them on all matters. After staying in Guilin for a week, he traveled to Liuzhou on December 14. Precise arrangements were also made regarding the military affairs of Liuzhou. Liuzhou is a natural fortress with overlapping mountains, roads extending in all directions, abundant food, sufficient military reserves, and the ability to coordinate and connect with Guiyang and Kunming. It is a key hub for military affairs, so military equipment is given special attention. After staying in Liuzhou for ten days, Bai went to Yongzhou, staying for five days. At that time, the commanders of the civil defense corps of Longzhou and Bose, the commanders of the defense forces in the various districts, the magistrates of the various counties, and a certain division commander stationed in Qinlian in Guangdong Province all went to Yongzhou to pay their respects. Comprehensive plans were also made for national defense matters in the Qinlian area and military transportation and transportation in Longzhou and Bose. On December 30, Bai returned to Guilin from Yongzhou and then traveled to Guixian. He also telegraphed Liang Chaoqi, Huang Jiji, and Long Zhenyi, the commanders of the civil defense corps of Yulin and Wuzhou, to Guixian to instruct them on the key points of defense in the Yuwu districts. At the same time, the magistrates of Guiping, Xingye, Pingnan, Rongxian, and Beiliu also went to Guixian to pay their respects to Bai and asked for instructions on the organization of local guerrilla forces. After staying in Guixian for three days, he returned to the Guilin headquarters on the 3rd of this month. This was Bai's first tour after taking office as Director of the Southwest Headquarters. According to news from the headquarters, Bai's tour of the various places was for: (1) to strengthen the anti-Japanese war strength of the civil defense corps in various districts of Guangxi Province, and the personnel issues of the commanders of the various districts will be readjusted; (2) the county magistrates of the counties adjacent to the various war zones on the Guangdong border will be replaced and capable people from the various counties will be appointed to call on the local civil defense corps to strengthen the local self-defense forces; (3) to strengthen the organization of the guerrilla forces in the various counties and expand the area of guerrilla warfare to punish the Japanese army invading the inland; (4) to thoroughly investigate the traffic conditions in the various districts and completely destroy the roads connecting Guangdong and Guangxi to eliminate the use of Japanese mechanized troops. The above four matters are all being actively carried out.

### Japanese Warships Head to Guangzhou Bay in Droves

Thirty-Six Ships, Large and Small, Pass Shantou, Nanao Invaded, Landed, and Burned Again

Shantou Communication: The Japanese army is launching a large-scale invasion of South China, and the rumors have become increasingly tense recently. At noon on the 16th, thirty-six Japanese warships, large and small, sailed past the Chao-Shan sea in groups, heading towards Guangzhou Bay. Among them were the main battleships Izumo, Myoko, and Kuma, and the aircraft carriers Ryujo and Hosho. It is rumored that the Japanese army is launching a general offensive against Beihai or Qiongya. At about 2:00 AM on the 17th, more small vessels (under 1,000 tons) sailed from Taiwan past the Mayu Port of Shantou, using searchlights to illuminate the rocky coast of Qilu Point. As soon as it was dawn, three Japanese planes flew low to reconnoiter the Fujian-Guangdong border. Two more destroyers docked at the Nan'gang Port of Chenghai County, blocking maritime traffic between Donglong and Nanao and driving fishing boats and bamboo rafts away from fishing at sea. At 10:00 AM on the 19th, two Japanese warships from Nan'gang Port sent out seven or eight armed motorboats to pursue sailboats carrying rice from the Fujian border to Shantou, and dispatched 200 marines in two teams to forcibly go to Nanao County, landing in the Houzhai Longao area and setting fire to newly restored police stations, Lianbao offices, and civilian primary schools. The residence of Wu, a special commissioner of the Nanao County government, was burned and looted. By 1:00 PM, the marines had withdrawn to the ships, and the only food available to the people had been completely taken away. The Shantou Puyi Society had twice sent people to Nanao to provide relief. On the 9th, 82.5 shi of rice were transported to Houzhai and distributed by Police Chief Huang Shaozong. On the 12th, rice tickets were distributed to each household, with each person receiving one jin of rice. A total of 3,061 households (certified by the Ba長) and 14,535 refugees received relief. One-third of the relief rice was distributed with tickets on the 16th. On the 19th, as soon as the Japanese army arrived, the Houzhai District Office was burned, and the undistributed rice was all taken down to the ships.

### Suzhou Farmers Resist the Puppet Regime

Over Three Hundred People Refuse to Pay Land Tax, Farmers Arrested and Falsely Accused of Being Communists

Suzhou Communication: The Suzhou puppet organization is holding a land tax collection, but since Li Chaoyuan, the puppet district chief of Nanbeiqiao, was shot and killed by guerrillas, the farmers in the surrounding countryside have been hesitant and unwilling to pay the rent. Later, Peng Gusun requested the puppet Huaijing Department and the Japanese military department to send Japanese and puppet troops to the countryside to protect the tax collectors. The Xietang Township Rent and Tax Joint Collection Bureau near the Kuatang Railway Station also requested the assistance of the puppet provincial police team to collect taxes as usual. The Bao長 Zhang Boquan gathered two to three hundred farmers to surround the puppet police team and carry out resistance. The puppet provincial police team, relying on its superior weapons, fired shots, killing six farmers on the spot. Zhang Boquan, Jin Xiuwen, Shen Jinshi, and others were arrested, escorted to the puppet Pacification Second District Headquarters, interrogated, falsely accused of being communist agents, and then brutally murdered. The puppet police team arrested more than 30 farmers from Hushu Pass, Loumenwai, and Fengmenwai and detained them in the puppet police station, where they were subjected to torture. The farmers in the four townships of Suzhou will have no way out under this brutal and cruel government.

### The Japanese Army Fantasizes About the Prosperity of Guangzhou

Intending to Collect Taxes to Provide Sustenance, A Large Number of Japanese Goods are Transported to Guangdong to Monopolize the Market

Hong Kong Communication: Since the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, three months have passed. The Japanese army authorities are eager to prosper the area and collect taxes to provide sustenance. When the Japanese army first entered the city, they sent planes to fly around every day, distributing surrender-style leaflets to entice citizens to return to Guangzhou. However, since Guangzhou has fallen and become a living hell, after the fires in Xiguan and Hanmin Road, the scene is desolate, thieves are rampant, and every household has been looted. The essence of the whole city has been exhausted. Even the poor people who were unable to flee are unsure of their survival. Therefore, the citizens who escaped the tiger's mouth are all willing to live in exile in other places and do not want to return to Guangzhou. The Japanese army obtained this empty city as if they had obtained a stone field. As a last resort, they used the policy of using Chinese to control Chinese and established a Guangzhou puppet organization.

After the establishment of the puppet organization, the Japanese army, in addition to strictly checking pedestrians in the city, continued to harass the people. Recently, the puppet Women's Maintenance Association sent a female inspection team to accompany the Japanese army to inspect female travelers on various roads. Inspection stations have been set up at the major intersections of the city, such as Hanmin Road, Haizhu South Road, Yifu West Road, Huifu East Road, Baohua Road, Sansheng Society, Cangbian Road, Dongdi Bridge, Haizhu Bridge, and Henan Xiaogang Road. Each station has a wooden table and pens and paper. A Japanese military policeman sits arrogantly at the top, specializing in interrogating suspicious incidents. If citizens are suspected and detained, they will be interrogated by the Japanese military police. If the detained person cannot communicate or is illiterate, they will be tied up without asking questions and made to kneel on the roadside, subject to slaps or whippings from the Japanese soldiers at any time. Their skin is broken and bleeding, and no one hears their cries. The situation is extremely cruel.

The Japanese army recently instigated the puppet organization to establish a puppet self-defense corps. The puppet self-defense corps in each street must be under the jurisdiction of the puppet self-defense corps branch in each district. Each member of the puppet self-defense corps receives four jiao for food each day, and the funds are raised by the local area or neighborhood. The original Japanese police district offices serve as the offices of the puppet self-defense corps branch. Each office is stationed with 20 puppet police officers. The branches are directly under the jurisdiction of the general office of the self-defense corps. The director of the general office is concurrently held by Ike, the commander of the Japanese military police. As for the waterway inspection, it has also been tightened recently. The Japanese Navy has established a puppet river channel inspection office at the provincial paper mill near Nantoutou in Henan, Guangzhou, and sends Japanese soldiers to guard the original Japanese wharf of the paper mill all the time. When a small boat passes through the river, it is ordered to approach for inspection. If it is slightly unsatisfactory, the people and goods will be detained. Occasionally, when foreign merchant ships pass through and sail to the Nantoutou river, they must also stop for inspection. Japanese personnel are sent on board the customs patrol boat to search, causing a disturbance for an hour before the foreign ships are allowed to pass.

When the Japanese army first entered the city, they originally intended to allow the soldiers to enjoy themselves for a few days. However, after entering the city, most of the citizens and women dispersed. As a result, the Japanese soldiers were greatly disappointed. A few days later, they tried to find out that the prostitute boats operating on the Pearl River in the past had all fled to a certain place in the South China Sea. They sent people to threaten and lure them back to the provincial river, where they were made to entertain the Japanese soldiers. Recently, at the Huahan Building Juxia on Taikang Road, they organized the so-called "Sino-Japanese Friendship Entertainment Center," inviting dancing girls, female socialites, and opera singers to entice pleasure-seekers and indulge in sensual pleasures. It is called friendship entertainment, but in reality, it is used to rope in traitors and detect internal affairs. Also, the former site of Yong'an Hall, a certain pharmacy on the embankment, was occupied by the Japanese and used to publish a newspaper, which is published once a day under the name "Guangdong Xunbao." However, its circulation is not wide. The Japanese put the newspaper on the walls and turn it into propaganda materials.

On the one hand, the Japanese are hypocritically attracting Cantonese people to return to Guangzhou. A merchant ship was once used to transport passengers and goods from Guangzhou to Macau, but it was not scheduled to sail. Travelers were afraid of being tricked and mostly hesitated. Seeing this situation, the Japanese changed their plans. They wanted to take advantage of Guangzhou's emptiness to recapture the South China market and monopolize the business in South China. Therefore, they are eager to encourage Japanese merchants to bring their families to Guangzhou and promote their business on a large scale, designating Dongshan as a residential area for Japanese merchants. At present, they have occupied the department store promotion site on the embankment, which was originally run by the Japanese, and converted it into a Japanese goods promotion site. Japanese goods stores are spread all over the western part of the city, and special ships are used to travel regularly between Guangzhou, Taiwan, and Japan, transporting Japanese goods south in an endless stream.

### Recent News on Chinese Army Encircling and Suppressing Japanese Troops in Qiaosu Two Counties

Japanese and puppet troops have repeatedly attempted to break through, but all attempts have failed. They are now holed up inside the city, firmly defending their lines.

A dispatch from Huaiyin: The counties of Suining and Suqian in northern Jiangsu have been occupied by Japanese and puppet troops for many days. The Chinese regular army, in conjunction with guerrillas and the armed populace, has actively resisted and attacked the Japanese and puppet forces, posing a great threat to them. The Japanese and puppet troops have suffered extremely heavy losses as a result. They are now increasingly besieged, and the day of their annihilation is probably not far off. The reports of the battles in these two counties are specially reported as follows:

Suining

According to recent news from Suining, after the county fell, some unconscionable Chinese traitors willingly accepted Japanese instigation and established a puppet organization, with the rogue Zhou Tongyi serving as the puppet county magistrate. At that time, there was a certain Shang Tigan, who was known for his extortion and skill in writing, and had the nickname "Shang the Pen." He was hired as the secretary of the puppet county government. Since taking office, he has been involved in smoking, gambling, exploitation, and extortion, doing anything and everything. Recently, when preparing the budget, he increased the monthly salary of the puppet secretary to an actual expenditure of 200 yuan. Unexpectedly, the puppet county magistrate did not agree and severely rebuked him. Thereupon, Shang Tigan displayed his beastly anger towards Zhou Tongyi, intending to resign, and moved out of the county government residence. Just at that moment, the Chinese army guerrillas rushed into the county town, went straight to the county government, and engaged the Japanese and puppet troops in a fierce battle. It is estimated that they killed a dozen Japanese and puppet troops and returned to their defense positions safely. The Japanese and puppet troops mistakenly believed that Zhou Tongyi was suspected of helping the guerrillas to disrupt the puppet organization and immediately detained Zhou in the county government for strict handling. After this news spread, everyone was very happy.

According to a telegram from the Suining County Regular Army Headquarters, the military information is as follows: (1) The Japanese army entrenched in Lingcheng now numbers about 100, with one mountain gun, one car, and a small number of cavalry. (2) The Japanese army in Qiaoning now numbers only a little over 200, with five or six large and small guns. The situation is extremely panicked. (3) On the 10th, 21 cars drove along the Zheng Coastal Highway from the west. The first and last cars each carried more than a dozen Japanese soldiers, and the others carried varying numbers of one or two soldiers, with many wooden boxes, the contents of which were unknown. All drove towards Suqian. (4) On the morning of the 11th, the Japanese army in Suqian used four cars to carry over a hundred soldiers and drove west, seemingly retreating. (5) The Japanese army, in the villages and weirs near Gengche and Shaji in Suining, used Chinese traitors to collect more than 200 civilian guns, which were sent to Xuzhou by car on the 8th. (6) Zhao Dehua, Xia Yinqiao, Qi Kangwu, and others, puppet district chiefs of the first, second, and third districts of Suining, act as accomplices, extorting money and property from the people to support the Japanese army, and forcing men over the age of twelve to buy "good citizen certificates," otherwise they will be treated as plainclothes soldiers, squeezing every last drop of blood. The people cannot bear it.

According to a telegram from County Magistrate Liu of Suining, the Japanese army transported more than ten cannons and over a hundred infantrymen from Suqian to Suining in early this month. Moreover, the Japanese infantry and cavalry troops stationed in Suqian and Gengche, numbering over three hundred, with ten guns and two cars, retreated westward through Shaji at noon on the 10th.

Suqian

Military information from the front: (1) There are currently over 500 Japanese and puppet troops in Suqian City, with four heavy guns, two small steel guns, and over twenty tanks and transport vehicles. They once harassed the eastern side of Suqian, but were all met head-on and driven back by the Chinese army. On the 15th, at dawn, the Japanese army, in coordination with over a hundred soldiers of various types, sallied out of the city and fired machine guns continuously at the Chinese army positions. At that time, the Chinese army ignored them. When the enemy troops approached the Chinese army, the Chinese army used hand grenades and bayonets to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. Many Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle. Suffering this setback, the Japanese army still scurried back to Suqian City. (2) There are currently only a small number of Japanese and puppet troops in Gengche in Suqian and Lingcheng Town in Suining. Because the guerrillas attack them from time to time, they dare not step beyond their defense network, so there has been no major contact between the two armies recently.

Since Shunheji in the Suqian territory was occupied by the Japanese army, the old people in the market town fled, leaving it empty. Before fleeing, the old people burned all the grain stored in their homes on the open ground south of the weir, fearing that it would be enjoyed by the Japanese army in the future, leaving nothing. Therefore, the Japanese army now entrenched in the town relies entirely on the supplies given by the Japanese army headquarters in Suqian City. It is also learned that the Chinese garrison stationed in Luwei constantly attacks the Japanese army. The previous night, over a dozen brothers who volunteered to be brave, each carrying short guns and hand grenades, secretly circled to Shunheji and launched a fierce attack on the important strongholds of the town. The Japanese army cowered and did not return fire throughout. The Chinese warriors set fire to and destroyed several places where the Japanese army was stationed and returned. Recently, the Japanese army in the town has been sleepless all night, randomly firing electric torches in all directions to prevent the guerrillas from attacking again. The people of Yantou Town in Suqian, seeing the rampant Japanese invaders, who burned, killed, raped, and disturbed everywhere, and fearing that they would inevitably suffer, have recently organized a "People's Self-Defense Force" on their own initiative, advocating the suppression of bandits and resistance against Japan. Over a hundred people have joined, with complete weapons, preparing to assist the army in recovering the county town.

According to Captain Xie, who has just returned from the masses, the Japanese army in Suqian, when they tried to make a move against Caojiaji, suffered a great blow from the Chinese army, suffered heavy losses, and retreated into Suqian City. In the city, they forced Chinese traitors and the people to dig and build defensive fortifications. However, the Chinese army is preparing to launch a counterattack soon, vowing to annihilate the enemy in the urn and recover the lost territory in northern Jiangsu.

### Japanese Army Conscripts in Weihaiwei

Guerrillas suddenly arrest all village chiefs. Japanese army conscription is attacked.

A correspondent for the English-language Da Mei Evening Post reports from Weihaiwei on January 23rd: An astonishing development has recently occurred here, as the Japanese army has begun to replenish its troops and announced conscription in this area. However, the events that occurred immediately after the Japanese army's announcement are also quite shocking. Guerrillas suddenly entered the city and arrested all the village chiefs and deputy village chiefs, preventing the conscription meeting from being held. The Japanese army claimed last week that it had decided to conscript and subsequently announced a conscription plan. In order to ensure that the conscription plan was effective and completed, the Japanese army ordered all the village chiefs and deputy village chiefs in its occupied areas to enter the city for a meeting. The Japanese army's intentions were disturbing to everyone, and the people seemed powerless to do anything about it. However, they did not count on the fact that the leader of the guerrilla unit in this area led his confidant troops from the mountains outside the city into the city at midnight that night (Saturday) and arrested all the village chiefs and deputy village chiefs. But no one knows where they were arrested. Currently, there are no village chiefs in the Japanese-occupied area, the meeting could not be held, and the conscription plan has been postponed as a result. It is not yet known whether the Japanese army will forcibly implement its plan. More than thirty years ago, the Chinese people here organized the Weihaiwei Regiment to assist the British army in fighting the Boxers and achieved great military success. Today, the Japanese army is also trying to use the Chinese people as war material.

### Hopeful Prospects for Blocking the Yellow River Breach; Chexin and Liang Dams to Be Constructed Soon

Provincial Government Responds by Telegram to Representatives of Seven Counties Downstream; Secretary-General Dispatched to Xinghua for Inspection

A dispatch from Xinghua: The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in response to the standing water downstream hindering spring plowing, ordered the seven counties downstream to meet in Dongtai to discuss appropriate drainage methods. After the meeting in Dongtai, each county publicly nominated Gu Zifang of Xinghua and Ling Huian of Gaoyou as representatives to telegraph the provincial government and forward the request to the central government to quickly block the Yellow River breach. The provincial government has now received a reply from the Executive Yuan, specifically ordering Dongtai County to inform the representatives by telegram. The telegram reads: "County Magistrate Su of Dongtai informs Representatives Gu Zifang and Ling Huian that their telegram has been received. It has been found that regarding the Yellow River breach in Henan, this government has repeatedly telegraphed the central government to arrange for its blocking. A reply has been received from the Executive Yuan, which has forwarded it to the relevant departments, ordering the Huayuankou embankment to be wrapped and plugged as appropriate. As for the Chexin and Liang Dams, the Transportation Bureau has been ordered to prepare materials, and construction can begin as soon as the water level drops. The Downstream Waterway Engineering Committee has reported that it has been established and has already dispatched personnel to conduct surveys and plan construction. A special reply."

Li Shouwei, deputy commander of a certain group army, whose garrison counties are close to the occupied areas, making their defense extremely important, recently came to Tong, Rugao, and Taixing Counties to inspect and guide. He then came to Yancheng on the 16th by boat to inspect the flood, and consulted with Commissioner Jin on the aftermath. Commissioner Jin told him that regarding drainage, the Waterway Engineering Committee had dispatched personnel to conduct surveys and plan to dredge the Babai Zhang Canal. The county's share of the funds has been paid in full. Purchasing materials for the Chexin and Liang Dam openings will cost no less than several tens of thousands of yuan, but funds are difficult and difficult to manage. Deputy Commander Li agreed to request funds from the provincial government to block the breach so that it could be completed quickly. Li then sailed to Yancheng on the same boat. The next morning (17th), Provincial Government Secretary-General Wang Gongzhu also arrived in Yancheng. According to Wang's statement to the reporters, this trip was undertaken by the provincial government to understand the official governance and popular sentiment in the province's counties, as well as the actual situation of mobilization work. In addition to dispatching personnel to various counties for inspection some days ago, it was still feared that they would not be able to represent the government in conveying its goodwill. Therefore, he personally went to the counties to conduct on-the-spot investigations and represent the chairman in comforting the people. He set off from Huaiyin on the morning of the 10th, and went to Taixing, Huangqiao, Hai'an, Dongtai, and other places. Coming to Yancheng today was not in the original itinerary. Because the provincial government heard that the county's military and flood disasters were particularly severe, he had Liu Bai inspect along the way, feeling that the water level was not as high as that of twenty years ago, but the impact of the water not receding was even greater. The wheat season is hopeless, and if there is a major spring drought, the rice fields will be impossible to plant, and the autumn harvest will be in danger. He had a conversation with Commissioner Jin. Regarding drainage, the Waterway Engineering Committee has planned to construct dredging. Regarding the source of the problem, funds should be requested from the provincial government to purchase materials and first block Chexin and Liang Dam openings to relieve the immediate crisis. He also decided to appeal to the central government to solicit funds to block and restore the Yellow River breach to cut off the source of the problem, so as to save the east side of Hongze Lake and save millions of lives downstream.

### Finance: Short covering leads to profit-taking, cash prices reverse downward

Closed at a low of 2024 yuan

Yesterday's cash market and the unofficial market suddenly fell again. It was heard that the foreign exchange market had loosened slightly after foreign telegraphic transfers were dumped, and because the situation in Europe was uncertain and difficult to predict, this stimulated selling. Money shops and cash houses scrambled to dump, and a large speculative group that had been inactive for a long time suddenly started selling aggressively. In addition, some short covering led to profit-taking. Although the Tianjin group still entrusted a certain money exchange to buy up the stock, the amount was limited, and this suppressed prices. Therefore, in the end, the demand felt excessive compared to the supply, and as a result, prices fell by 11 yuan. However, the fluctuations in the middle were still unstable, but there were no major waves. The sentiment of all parties was slightly tired, and trading was still active, at 850 taels. Silver ornaments, gold, and customs gold remained unchanged. British gold, etc., fell slightly.

Cash Market Falls 11 Yuan

From the morning, there were no transactions at 10 taels per bar. At 9:40, the first transaction was a gold shop selling 50 taels to a money exchange, and a money shop selling 50 taels to a money exchange, both at the opening price of 2025 yuan. Subsequently, a money exchange bought 100 taels from a money shop, all at 33 yuan; another 50 taels from a money shop, at 32 yuan; another 50 taels from a money shop, at 31 yuan; a gold shop bought 50 taels from a money shop, at 30 yuan; and then a money exchange bought 50 taels from a money shop, at 29 yuan. During this period, a certain cash house and the Dalian group suddenly dumped, causing prices to continue to fall, selling 50 taels to a certain money exchange at 26 yuan. Money shops did 50 taels of inter-shop trading at 28 yuan. A money shop bought 50 taels from a money exchange at 25 yuan. It was about 10:30 at that time. Afterwards, a money exchange came to buy again, and at that time there were very few sellers, so prices jumped by 5 yuan, buying 50 taels from a money shop at 30 yuan, and then 50 taels from a money shop at 29 yuan. It was already 11:30. After that, there were no transactions, so the noon closing price was still 29 yuan. It was heard that after the close, the Dalian group sold 50 taels to a client at 29 yuan. In the afternoon, the initial call was still 28-29 yuan. Later, because a certain cash house came to sell again, and a certain money exchange's appetite turned sluggish, prices fell sharply again. The first transaction was a money exchange selling 50 taels to a fellow trader, and a cash house selling 50 taels to a money exchange, both at 26 yuan. Subsequently, there was inter-shop trading of 50 taels between money exchanges at 24 yuan. After that, there was still intention to supply at 24 yuan from the selling side, but most buyers were in a wait-and-see mode, so there were no transactions. Therefore, the closing price was still 2024 yuan, a decrease of 11 yuan compared to the previous day. The selling price of the cash house's own-brand gold was 2030 yuan, and the buying price was 2015 yuan. The current standard gold price is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were no transactions.

Ornamental Gold Remains Unchanged

The exchange rates for ornamental gold in silver and jewelry shops have not changed. Da Tonghang, Lao Qingyun, and others still maintain the original price of 206 yuan, while Xin Tonghang lists 204 yuan for selling and 198 yuan for buying.

Pure Gold Contracts by Half a Penny

London, 26th: English pure gold suddenly contracted by half a penny per ounce, falling to £7 8s 8d. The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese pure gold also fell to 1113 yuan and 60 cents. The listed Customs Gold price remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 9 li. The price of Shanghai standard gold fell 3 jiao, totaling 1208 yuan and 90 cents.

### Silver Bullion Continues to Contract

London, 26th: Trading is limited, with a few sellers. The market is calm. After the close, continuous stable sellers. Buyers watch the posted prices. Silver bullion for spot and future trading continues to shrink .0625. New York silver report: American silver prices remain active but without a market. Also, the Bombay silver report: Indian silver is closed with no market.

### Foreign Currencies Decline Slightly

Yesterday, English pure gold fell by half a penny, and the exchange rate between English and American currencies fell by .0625. Foreign exchange settlements were weak and abundant. The process was stable. English currency eased slightly and American currency by half, because the exchange rate declined slightly. Short sellers mostly closed out with profits. The Tianjin group sold off slightly, so the bargaining chips were slightly abundant. The market gradually declined. Foreign currencies have risen rapidly in recent days. Today, the foreign exchange market is hovering with easing and short sales falling, following the decline. The Bank of England and English silver slightly purchased. The market price fell considerably. There were no deals for the guild. Yesterday's market prices: gold pounds down 2 jiao, English gold notes down 6 fen, American gold pounds down 5 fen, American gold notes down 1 fen, Hong Kong notes down 3 li, French franc notes up half a li, Canadian notes up 2 fen. Other currencies remained unchanged.

### Discount Rate Rises Half a Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for drafts and bills of exchange continued to be high. Every thousand yuan rose from 36 yuan, 2 jiao and 5 fen in the morning to 37 yuan. At noon, it was 36 yuan and 7 jiao. It settled down in the afternoon, up half a yuan compared to the previous day.

### Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Narrow Again

The foreign exchange market eased yesterday because foreign firms settled fewer accounts and because foreign telegraphic transfers suddenly came in, causing latent potential to ease. There were few changes along the way. Transactions were still smooth. The Hong Kong exchange rate also saw a slight slowdown because foreign banks' appetites turned sluggish.

Initially, the London silver bullion near and far continued to contract, the New York silver price did not move, the London pound fell .0625, the rate against the French franc fell .0625, and the rate against Shanghai fell by a small 6 fen. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened early with spot prices of English exchange at 8 shillings 3.28125 pence and American exchange at 16.21875 yuan, both flat compared to the previous close. After opening, foreign telegraphic transfers flooded in with English gold at 8 shillings 3.34375 pence (from Sassoon, Guangdong, and Advantage Bank) and American exchange at 16.25 yuan (from Hua Bi, Holland, and American Bank). In addition, banks' appetite was not good, and foreign electric transfer supplies were increasingly tight, so it immediately hardened to English gold at 8 shillings 3.59375 pence and American gold at 16.28125 yuan. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's listed price remained unchanged, and the white silver equilibrium tax continued to contract by half a cent. After that, although foreign firms raised the American exchange rate to 16.25 yuan, and Western merchant Sassoon bought and closed English gold at 8 shillings 3.34375 pence, because banks dumped stocks, there was little change. Near noon, money exchanges frequently sold Hong Kong exchange to Guangdong, Holland, and Advantage Banks from 55.875 yuan to 56 yuan, so the situation was still easing. The noon close was English gold at 8 shillings 3.34375 pence and American exchange at 16.25 yuan.

Although foreign firms again increased the American exchange to 16.25 yuan, and again earned a profit on salt exchange English gold at 8 shillings 3.34375 pence, because bank supplies were still abundant, there was still little movement. Later, speculators suddenly sold American gold notes to Hua Bi, Holland, and American Bank at 16.375 yuan, and money exchanges also supplied and sold Hong Kong exchange at 56 yuan. Because banks were all absorbing the supply, the situation was still stable. Until the evening close, the bank's selling price was English exchange at 8 shillings 3.34375 pence and American exchange at 16.25 yuan. As a result, the English exchange hardened by .015625 compared to the previous close, the American exchange lengthened by .03125, and the Hong Kong exchange also hardened by .25. Here is a record of the day's trading activity.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Close Today; Foreign Bonds Slightly Active

The securities market was still gradually declining yesterday. In a kind of sluggish state, with the loss of popularity, it felt even more unable to raise its head. The market price was approaching the time of interest payment, and it was unable to recover. After the fall on the 16th, it actually found a new low price for this month. After the interest payment from February 1st, the market price is feared to be not able to recover for a while. Yesterday, trading was only done for half a day in the morning. Today is the anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai War of Resistance, so the market is closed. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, the market was closed in preparation for delivery. Trading was therefore very quiet, and the trend was still slowly declining. At the initial opening, number 6 had a little buying interest, but the Guangdong group's selling of number 25 was surging, and the market price felt unsustainable. Later, there were more sales of number 20, with even fewer buyers, so the price never settled. The half-day result was a drop of 2 jiao to 8 jiao. Varieties and 96 had no transactions. The total transaction volume for the remaining varieties for half a day was estimated at over 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

The listed prices for London Chinese foreign debt on Thursday, January 26th, seemed to be slightly more active. The upper grades generally fell by half a pound to one pound. The lower grades of railway bonds were stable and unchanged. The Anglo-German continued loan English bonds fell by one pound, priced at 72 pounds. Crisp bonds rose by one pound yesterday, but returned to the original level of 34 pounds today. The Anglo-Gold Rehabilitation Bonds and the Central Bank bonds continued to fall by one pound, priced at 47 pounds. The Sino-French American Dollar 5% Bonds with Indian bond coupons fell by half a pound, priced at 68 pounds and a half. London's supply and demand for physical goods is still not lonely, with the Anglo-Gold Rehabilitation Bonds English issued bonds selling 5,000 pounds at a price of 47 pounds at par. Sino-French American Dollar 5% Bonds with Indian bond coupons also sold 5,000 pounds (i.e., 25,000 American dollars) at a price of 64 American dollars, down 1 American dollar, 3 jiao, and 7 and a half fen from the previous day, or 68 pounds and a half English gold at par, down 7 shillings and 6 pence from yesterday's market. On the railway bond side, Guangdong Five Railway Bonds sold 2,500 pounds at a price of 18 pounds and a half at par, down 5 shillings from yesterday's market. Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bonds had 5,000 pounds of buying interest at a price of 22 pounds at par. The market situation is still sluggish and unsustainable.

The listed prices for London British merchant Far East companies' stocks on Thursday, January 26th, fell slightly. Jardine Matheson Bank shares fell 5 shillings, priced at 8 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence. Kaiping Mining anonymous shares fell 6 pence, priced at 16 shillings.

### Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Speculators Quietly Await Lunar Year End Collapse

Although there is currently no major improvement in actual sales, this hope is not dead. Japanese yarn short squeezes rise by five to six yuan.

The yarn market started to rise and then fell back. The result was still calm, because actual demand has still not developed significantly, sentiment is relaxed, and the lunar new year is approaching, so all parties are preparing to close their accounts. Therefore, actual transactions are feared not to have a significant improvement. However, according to another discussion, the situation in Guangdong is tightening recently, and the currency of South China is not as lively as before, but our side has early defense work that is very solid, with no chance to exploit. Around mid-December, merchants may have the idea of purchasing goods for the opening of the new year. As the saying goes, "lunar year end collapse," so those holding goods are quiet as usual. As for the goods hoarded by the financial world, they have just begun to be collected, and there is no reason to release them this year. Based on the above situation, if there is no unexpected stimulation, the market may be in a state of hovering.

Checking the current yarn and cloth market today, the opening in the morning was because the previous day's big drop caused Guangdong merchants to seize cheap goods, and in the afternoon the opportunity turned back to Suzhou. Therefore, it continued to rise with the remaining momentum of the previous day. 20s Shuangma opened with an increase of 2 yuan, to 402 yuan. Shortly thereafter, traders made up for their losses, adding another 1 yuan, to 403 yuan. Warehouse receipts were done at 399 yuan. A certain yarn shop acting on behalf of speculators again bought more than 100 bales of 20s Shuangqiujiu at a price of 393 yuan to 4 yuan. However, some traders in a certain yarn shop had already sold their large amounts, but most had not yet closed their positions, so the market situation rose and fell indefinitely. Most were waiting for a small decline before buying again, because raw cotton was difficult to loosen, and speculators bought in but would not sell. After that, it was heard that actual sales were not strong, and it turned weak again. 20s Shuangma returned lower to close at 401 yuan. Checking the morning transaction statistics, 1,335 bales were traded, with transactions between traders still accounting for the majority. As a result, the market price of 20s Shuangma rose by 1 and a half yuan compared to the previous day, Tiannv rose by 3 yuan, Shuangqiujiu rose by 2 yuan, Te Jincheng rose by 2 yuan, and 16s rose by 1 yuan. Coarse yarn was still stable. The factory opened 25 bales of 20s Te Jincheng from Yong'an Factory at a price of 404 yuan, and Anda Yarn Factory opened 50 bales of 20s Feihu at a price of 395 yuan, all in spot.

Today, 270 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, 10 pieces to Hong Kong, 210 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 45 pieces to Haikou, and 380 pieces to Haiphong. Today is the January 28th Anniversary, and the yarn and cotton market is closed for one day. Here is a record of the amount bought by each group.

In the Japanese yarn market, the trend suddenly tightened. Although actual transactions were not strong, because the deadline for short selling was approaching, those making up for their losses surged, and the short squeeze was huge. The market price was rising, rising by 5 to 6 yuan. The spot price of 20s Shuiyue is 326 yuan, and the price for the next month is 330 yuan. The spot price of 20s Lanfeng is 323 yuan, and the price for the next month is 324 yuan.

### North-South Goods: Black Fungus and Dried Longan Reopen at Higher Prices

Black fungus has recently been scarce, and the listed price has tightened again. The listed price for large Sichuan packets has risen to 240 yuan, Hankou fungus to 224 yuan, and the next grade to 214 yuan. The market price has therefore increased accordingly. Yesterday, an airline brand fungus sold for 225 yuan per packet, and so on, gradually decreasing.

Shima dried longan is scarce because the production price in Zhangzhou has risen again by 1 to 2 yuan, and it is difficult to match the declared price. The market opened again with an increase of 1 yuan, and the same increase occurred for summer dried longan. A total of more than ten boxes were traded, but ordinary goods were unable to keep up the good work due to their impure quality. The original price still had a price opening.

### Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Prices Affected by the New York Stock Market

Domestic Silk Remains Strong

Today, the overseas silk market turned to a downward trend due to the influence of the falling New York stock market. Recent futures on the New York Stock Exchange plummeted by six cents, and the accumulation of gains over the past two weeks was completely lost. Futures fell by three cents, and Japanese silk fell by two cents, for an overall relatively stable result. Spot prices on the Yokohama Stock Exchange fell by 20 yuan yesterday, and futures fell by 17 yuan, making it even more difficult for local foreign firms to approach. The domestic sales market for white filature silk was slightly stimulated yesterday, but because the price of orchid was still strong, the selling quality of B-grade 20-22 denier still remained at the 1370 yuan line. Yesterday, sales to India continued to improve. Yesterday, 40 loads of raw native silk from Muzhen were traded, with new Da Sanxing and other firms buying aggressively. Silk prices are expected to rise.

### Coal: Hokkaido Coal

New Goods Arrived

The supply of Kai Ping coal dust has recently become extremely scarce, with sources nearly cut off. However, demand from customers is very high, and supply cannot meet demand. Prices remain firm. A certain foreign firm in this city, recognizing this situation, yesterday received a new shipment of Hokkaido coal, totaling over 1,200 tons of dust and lumps, which is being unloaded in Pudong. The price for lumps is 38 yuan per ton, and coal dust is 32 yuan. Delivery is from the Pudong warehouse, and handling fees are the buyer's responsibility.

### Cotton Sales Unresolved: U.S. Cotton Prices Increasingly Sluggish

Quality Materials Purchased by All: Foreign Cotton Trade Consequently Stagnant

In the foreign cotton market, U.S. cotton prices are sluggish because the European political situation is unsettled, and speculators are taking a wait-and-see approach, awaiting developments. Issues under discussion in Washington, such as cotton industry legislation and the sale of loan cotton, remain unresolved, causing cotton prices to be exceptionally sluggish. Georgia Congressman Ker Ven Sen has also proposed to the government that the previously established regulations restricting cotton fields be abandoned, allowing people to assume their own guarantees, and that the cotton produced in previously barren cotton fields should only be used for domestic consumption. Yesterday, due to a sharp drop in securities, the New York cotton market was dragged down another ten-odd points. India's market was closed yesterday, with predictions of a drop of more than half a rupee from the previous day. Egyptian cotton fell twenty points. Yesterday's exchange rate was very stable. Converted to legal tender, cotton prices all fell. U.S. cotton and Brazilian cotton each fell eight jiao per dan (a unit of weight), Indian cotton fell two and a half jiao per dan, and Egyptian cotton fell one yuan and six jiao per dan.

The foreign cotton trade in this city is quieter among the various factories, all because of a consistent expectation of falling foreign cotton prices. However, many Indian cottons have been purchased recently in the flower number market. Yesterday, Jian Yuan and Mao Xin two firms even opened for more than three thousand packages. Currently, various yarn factories are enjoying booming business and substantial profits, and they are selecting superior raw cotton for purchase, unlike in the past when they were more concerned with cost calculations. The main reason why yarn factories can have huge profits is that cotton yarn sales are strong, which is well known. However, in addition to this, there are shortcuts to seek, leading to quick riches, but these are not what Chinese factories are willing to do. This newspaper, for the sake of merchant credibility, does not wish to dampen enthusiasm by revealing the details. However, please correct any shortcomings and encourage those without them, to comfort the hearts of soldiers serving on the front lines. The transaction amounts and prices for yesterday are listed below:

### Local Cotton Trade Appears Stagnant

The local cotton business is becoming increasingly dull, with various factories remaining as sluggish as ever, showing no signs of activity. This is due to the high prices and the scarcity of sources from various regions, making it impossible to purchase large quantities. Therefore, both Chinese and foreign factories have simply given up. Moreover, with the traditional New Year approaching, flower numbers also have a closing period, and are showing a relaxed attitude towards business. Transactions on the market are quiet. The Su Bei route to Tou still considers itself bad. The wharf has 1,761 bales of Tonghua cotton, and 260 pieces of cotton from Xin Gang. There are 550 pieces from Beisha. Today, there are two hundred pieces of cotton machine flower being exported to Tianjin. The current cotton transaction volumes and market conditions are listed on the left:

### An Exploration of the Surging Price of Japanese Yarn

Raw Materials Expensive, Factories Unwilling to Compromise: Japanese Merchants Directly Distributing in Guerrilla Areas

Recently, the market price of Japanese yarn has been advancing steadily, rising by more than ten yuan in recent days, reaching a new high for this year. In mid-October, when the peak price of Chinese yarn was 515 yuan, the price of Japanese 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was only around 317 or 318 yuan, never exceeding 320 yuan. Yesterday, the price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn reached 324 yuan, with the spot month price reaching thirty yuan, revealing a new peak for this year. According to information gathered from inquiries, it is said that with the end of January approaching, factories are unwilling to compromise on sales due to the high cost of raw materials and want to sell at higher prices. Recently, over 300 bales of spot month copper tube yarn from Chinese and foreign yarn factories have been offered at a price of 320 yuan, with small packages plus consolidated tax, for a net price of 332 yuan. Sales for February and March are clear. Moreover, Japanese merchants can directly distribute goods in the Yangtze River guerrilla areas, making business more active than before, and selling prices are also higher than in Shanghai. With these claims, buyers seem to be short squeezing, pushing prices up by about ten yuan in the last two days. (A)

### Fixed Futures: Tianjin Merchants Actively Purchasing Eastern Fixed White Goods

Transactions Reach Two Thousand Pieces: Selling Prices Rise Sharply: State Cloth Prices High, Customers Watch

The state cloth market has been affected by the sharp rise in Dongpi goods. Factories have raised prices greatly, and businesses intend to watch for higher prices, resisting price reductions. However, because customer demand has not increased, buyers and sellers are at a stalemate. New transactions are becoming more cautious. However, spring-colored goods such as plain silk crepe, foreign yarn, and hemp yarn are seeing the most significant increases in raw material prices for fine yarns. Combined with support from real demand from distant regions, market prices are continuing to rise by three to five jiao per piece. Bleached cloth, bleached twill, and colored cloth are up two jiao. White goods, especially nine-pound coarse cloth, are in strong demand. Hengfeng and Yuxin Valley factories' undergarments have risen by one and a half jiao per piece, with nearly a hundred pieces purchased by this street. Yihua coarse cloth, sourced from Ningbo merchants, accounted for sixty pieces. Tianjin Hengyuan Factory's artillery fine cloth, sourced from Ningbo and Shaoxing merchants, accounted for forty to fifty pieces. Tianjin merchants purchased over two thousand pieces of plain silk crepe and blue cloth. Yantai merchants bought one hundred and forty to fifty pieces of bleached cloth, floral serge, woolen fabric, and coarse cloth. Quanzhou, Wenzhou, and Ningbo merchants added only about one hundred pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, woolen fabric, and serge. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan are seeing robust demand for light-colored spring goods, with approximately two thousand pieces of floral cloth, satin, silk crepe, bleached cloth, bleached twill, and Yabu cloth continuing to be purchased. Only five to six hundred pieces of blue cloth and colored twill were purchased. Demand from Shantou is also weakening. Chinese factory products are still mainly used to deliver fixed order gray cloth to this street.

Eastern fixed white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill saw vigorous purchases from Tianjin merchants yesterday, with transactions reaching two thousand pieces. Selling prices rose uniformly, with asking prices increasing by two to three jiao per piece. Dyers on this street are eagerly searching for goods, but due to the rapid price increases and the scarcity of spot goods, the amount purchased is relatively small, with daily transactions totaling less than a thousand pieces. Industry members have opened for seven hundred packages of fine twill from foreign firms, with Dragon Head making a price of 11 yuan 3 jiao and a half for February delivery. Dragon Head fine cloth is priced at 11 yuan 8 jiao and a half, but the quantity is small. This is because firms are constrained by factory prices, and all high-end fine cloths require around 12 yuan. It is also heard that factory-opened Caiqiu fine cloths have been ordered, with each piece costing 12 yuan and 6 li including tax.

In terms of exports, today there are three hundred pieces of fixed goods being shipped to Tianjin, two hundred and fifty pieces to Yantai, two hundred and fifty pieces to Shantou, twelve pieces to Hong Kong, eighty-five pieces to Wanhai Kou, and five hundred and ninety pieces to Haiphong.

The needs of various factories are not urgent, because the supply of foreign wheat is continuous, the wheat influence is self-evident. As a result, the transaction volume was only 2,500 bags, with 2,000 bags purchased by Fuxin Factory and 1,500 bags by Yifeng Factory. The highest price remains 6 yuan 5 jiao. The market is still on the market.

There will be no competition today on "January 28th".

### Talking about Literature

— Yuntian

Japanese culture is in prison.

The fascist warlords have long since worn out the iron bars: Several years ago, Takiji Kobayashi and others died alive in the miserable hell. After August 13th, Shigeharu Nakano, who was as famous as Kobayashi, the female writer Yuriko Miyamoto, and the old literary authorities Ujo Noguchi and Kan Eguchi, have all been imprisoned one after another. The warlords are very carefully preserving culture with iron chains.

The pathetic Naoya Shiga used alcohol to numb his nerves and was fortunate enough to avoid imprisonment, but he deeply felt the pain of being a mute. Shirō Ozaki and Koreto Kurahara temporarily stopped their translation work and were waiting for the eruption of the volcano.

In addition, the military authorities are also actively whipping a group of jumping clowns. The speculators Fusao Hayashi and Haruo Satō appear to be active. The talks at the "Literary Round Table Conference" are very sincere, but they cannot hide the rustling trembling of the patriots (?). What are they doing? Although Kikuchi Kan's "Bungei Shunju" has wiped away the traces of "triangles and quadrangles", he continues to engage in the work of "temporary excitement". The effect of the old-fashioned literature is exactly the same as before. The authorities also organized a "warrior group of pen holders" presided over by Masao Kume, who came to China happily. A few "warriors" were so frightened by the sound of artillery that they sneaked away.

Naturally, they also participated in the ranks of welcoming the remains of deceased soldiers back to court seven years ago: They wore command knives, yelled from horseback, and held boxes wrapped in yellow silk in their hands. Those warriors who returned in triumph transformed the faces on the Shanghai battlefield, weren't they majestic? So they read and sighed beside them, singing and crying in accordance with the rhythm of "Kimigayo"; in the meantime, they cleverly neutralized the real tears of the people with each other. They sing about the "victory of death" (Triunfodella Morte), with an arrogant posture; but the literature is still like duck eggs.

This time, the situation has changed, although it is still like duck eggs: Tatsuzo Ishikawa vaguely sheds tears of despair for a group of "undead soldiers." . Their own ashes cannot return to court, how long will the war be prolonged? In this way, the "undead soldiers" eventually caused a storm in the country. Then, punishment: After the buns: Make amends with merit! The warlords know that "culture is in prison" and there is no one outside.

The "soldiers of the pen" will understand under their feet. They are accustomed to relying on the old experience of "Kimigayo" to brag and deceive the people who lack tears in the newspapers of their own country. Tatsuzo Ishikawa ended up adding a tail to himself, which was too narrow.

It is no wonder that the "soldiers of the pen" are not skilled enough, and the singing is only 喴嘁嚓曢, and also contains a sobbing tone; because the subject matter is like this, it cannot be recovered. The literature here is outside the "Pen Warrior Corps": of the same language and the same race, originally friends like hands and feet;

The warlord devil creates bottomless deep hatred.

Charge and slaughter, millions of people turned to ashes,

How can condemnation not fall on the devil's hand?

The blue sky and white sun shine on the earth, when will the blue clouds of world peace unfold?

Millions of blind eyes open in the artillery fire.

Beloved wife! We want to kiss each other, this life is difficult to be born again.

(See Quanzhou News on the 20th)

The author of this song, Yamada Saburo, the air defense electrician squad leader, is very clear: It is inevitable that the ashes cannot be taken back; what is the eternal lineage will collapse with the mud feet.

From then on, singing "Loyal Remains Return to Court" has become a historical relic, and the tail of the "Soldier with the Pen" will sooner or later become a beautiful pattern on fossils.

It is said that Yamada Saburo will be sentenced to death and will have to go to prison again to practice his "difficult to be born again in this life", but this is really a pity. Their group should take the path of Wataru Rojima. Isn't it the most glorious thing to be a great singer of justice? It is freedom that flies outside the prison, the blue sky and white sun.

Naturally, the pain of "difficult to be born again" cannot be relieved without this; the comfort of the military monks among the "undead soldiers" is futile, and salvation is also like duck eggs. Those who hold Buddhist beads in one hand and steel shovels in the other will surely let their souls hold their own ashes and treat them as "loyal remains returning to court". But where do you "return" to? Mount Fuji is about to erupt! It is too far away from "achieving enlightenment". Therefore, I slightly changed the dying poem of Ji Dian and shouted fiercely:

"For a year and a half, it has been in a mess, hitting the east wall to the west wall; from now on, pack up and return, and you will not see the water connecting to the sky."

### Eight Character Bridge and Jiangwan

— Kamon

Commemorating "January 28th"

Today is the seventh anniversary of "January 28th".

Every year, when "January 28th" arrives, I always can't help but go to Zhabei to take a tour of the battle traces of "January 28th" and pay my respects once. Now on this dull "isolated island", the environment no longer allows me to go to Zhabei to inspect on the eve of "January 28th". Moreover, those places have suffered a catastrophe and are stained with the hot blood of thousands of patriots. After the fall, they have become forbidden cities, and people who are unwilling to be "docile people" will not go to get a "pass" and go to those places. However, the impression of Zhabei is still deeply imprinted in my mind. And the impression of Eight Character Bridge and Jiangwan is particularly profound in my mind.

Along Song Park Road to Liuying Road, walking east from the west end of Liuying Road, along a small flood, passing a few small broadcasts, when you reach the end of Liuying Road, it is the Eight Character Bridge where the Chinese and Japanese troops had dozens of struggles and hand-to-hand combats in the "January 28th" battle. Several stunted trees with collapsed tops stand on a cinder road, with a small bridge lying across it with the words "Eight Character Bridge" written on it, which will immediately make people awe-inspiring and feel that this small bridge is an indelible memorial.

This Eight Character Bridge had already been completely destroyed in the "January 28th" battle. The Eight Character Bridge on which I was based later was rebuilt in 1933. Now, the rebuilt Eight Character Bridge is probably destroyed again. In the past, there were some houses and shops on both sides of the Eight Character Bridge. It seemed that this place had never had a fierce war, but when I looked carefully, there were still many houses with traces of bullets and bullets left on the walls. Opposite the Eight Character Bridge is Hongkou Park and Tiantong'an, and on the right is Liu San Garden. The importance of the terrain can be imagined, so if there is a war, it is a must-contested place.

Once you pass the Eight Character Bridge and walk east, it is Shuidian Road. On Shuidian Road, gun scars and bullet marks can also be found everywhere on the trunks or walls. Public buses pass by, directly to Jiangwan. Before "August 13th", if you went to Jiangwan, you might not see any traces of war on the streets, but if you were silent for a moment and took a further perspective, you could see that most of the houses on the streets were newly built, and the facts would immediately tell you that Jiangwan had been baptized by artillery fire in the "January 28th" battle.

Walking from the bustling streets to the deserted outskirts, the broken walls and rubble, and the fire fields piled up, can still be found constantly. The traces of artillery fire can also be found very clearly. The "January 28th" battle not only drove away all the residents of Jiangwan, but also bombed their houses together. If you meet Jiangwan people who like to talk, they will open the box of words and tell you how serious the damage in Jiangwan was during the "January 28th" and how painful the Jiangwan people were when they fled outside.

Eight Character Bridge and Jiangwan have become glorious monuments in history for "January 28th". In the process of five years, although the destroyed situation of Eight Character Bridge and Jiangwan has been restored, the "August 13th" battle made countless men sprinkle their hot blood on the old wine again, and suffered a more intense baptism of artillery fire, after all, added a glory to the glory and became an indelible memorial place. I am looking forward to the arrival of the final victory, preparing to go to Eight Character Bridge and Jiangwan again to pay tribute to the loyal souls and mourn the patriots in silence!

### "Fight to the End!" (Woodcut)

— Li Yishan

### Agonizing Spark

— Lu Keshi

He walked forward unconsciously.

The noisy shouts of military vehicles and vendors floating up from the road were inaudible to him; he only felt a heaviness in his head.

Just now, his mother's curses seemed to have turned into countless mosquitoes, constantly stinging into his eardrums.

"You don't have to curse, I'm leaving. See, I won't come back even if I die!" He remembered saying this to his mother when he walked out of the house. At that time, the blood in his whole body was about to boil, and his ears were buzzing…

But now he felt empty again, as if he had lost something.

"It's really hard for two generations to understand each other!"

He remembered his mother saying to him once:

"I know you are by no means a frivolous young man. You are not extravagant at all, and you don't do any bad things. You give all the little money you have worked so hard to get to sick friends. I understand all of this. But it's just that we walk different paths!"

When his mother spoke, a strong emotion flowed across her face. That night, his mother made a long prayer for him (she was a devout believer), praying for a change in his fate.

He tried his best to suppress these chaotic thoughts.

From some store, old tunes of a radio were released in a muffled voice. An inexplicable hatred surged from the bottom of his heart.

Several speeding cars stirred up the yellow dust on the road, filling the air with sand and mist. He stopped at an intersection and mechanically tossed the hair that had fallen in front of his eyes to the back. Finally, he decided to find K.

When he arrived, K had not yet returned. He silently ran into the small room where K lived.

This small room was still the same as usual: filled with an atmosphere of tranquility.

He grabbed a book from the bookshelf at random, slumped on the bed, but after reading only a few lines, he threw it down again.

Although he had only known K for over a year, their understanding of each other was very deep. He always told K everything innocently.

The surrounding air was unusually quiet. After a while, a loud footstep actually came up the stairs. He thought it must be K, but the person who came up walked away again.

He walked out anxiously.

When he returned, K was already sitting in the room.

"Were you here just now?" K asked brightly.

He did not answer. At this moment, he only felt that all emotions were filled in his chest.

"What's the matter?" K was a little surprised.

"Let's go for a walk!" He murmured as if he were talking to himself.

As they walked out the door, the early winter wind blew on their faces. They did not feel cold, and the flame of friendship burned in the hearts of the two young men. He felt warm.

Three

Late at night.

He went home after K's persuasion.

The street was quiet, and the bleak moonlight poured a pool of white light on the ground. Several conflicting emotions were causing a great conflict in his heart.

"Will I be ridiculed by my mother when I go back?"

K's words were closely attached to his mind:

"As long as you don't argue out of pride and patiently try to persuade her. A mother will not stop loving her son."

But now he completely lost his rationality, only emotional agitation.

After entering the room, he quietly went to bed. The oil lamp in the room had already been extinguished, and he expected that his mother must have fallen asleep long ago.

He tossed and turned and could no longer fall asleep. Those days that had passed flashed before his eyes, and he sank into the dreamland of memories.

——Five years ago, he contracted a terrible disease. One night, his condition suddenly worsened, and the doctor could only shake his head. At that time, his mother's pain was indescribable. She knelt in front of his bed, frantically calling out. She called out to the heavens; she said she was willing to reduce her own lifespan and sacrifice her own life to save her son from danger…

"But what is separating us now? For the happiness of hundreds of millions of people, Mother! I am willing to endure anything." A sudden tremor surged in his chest, and his eyes filled with passionate tears.

Suddenly the oil lamp lit up, and he quickly closed his eyes calmly. Gradually, he felt someone moving in the room, and felt a layer of blanket being placed on his body.

In the darkness, a few cold drops of water fell on his face, followed by a warm hand stroking his forehead.

He opened his eyes:

"Mother!"

### Today, All Circles Mournfully Commemorate the Seventh Anniversary of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. The Whole City Flies Flags at Half-Mast and Suspends Entertainment Banquets. Shops Hold Charity Sales and Donate Money to the Government. All Circles Unanimously Support the National Policy of Resistance Against Japan.

Today is the seventh anniversary of the "January 28th" Songhu Anti-Japanese War. All circles in this city, now that the full-scale War of Resistance Against Japan has entered its second phase, rely on the wise leadership and planning of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Millions of soldiers have fought bloody battles, and the whole country has reached unprecedented unity. The international situation is improving day by day, and the final victory is not far off. On this anniversary of the first decisive battle of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War, recalling the martyrs who died for their country and the compatriots who suffered, it is enough to inspire tragic emotions. Therefore, we are determined to follow the regulations of the Municipal Party Headquarters and commemorate it mournfully to encourage ourselves. All companies, shops, and households in the city will fly flags at half-mast for one day. In addition to fasting, all citizens will stand silently at their posts at 12 noon for three minutes to mourn the soldiers who died in battle. All entertainment venues in the city will also voluntarily close for one day. At the same time, in order to support the national policy of resistance against Japan and complete the great cause of national construction, major stores will implement charity sales and remit the proceeds to the bank for donation to the government to be used as war funds. The "One Yuan to Repay the Debt" campaign, fundraising for winter clothing, and the relief of victims will continue enthusiastically to fully demonstrate the patriotism of the people in the isolated island.

### A Letter to the Public from the Municipal Party Headquarters

Great history, before the launch of the August 13th Chinese National Revolutionary War, wrote a brilliant page of the January 28th Songhu Anti-Japanese War. At that time, although preparations were not yet complete and the timing was not yet ripe, it later suffered a slight setback. However, this was by no means a failure, but the prelude to the rebirth of the Chinese nation. In this bloody battle, the Chinese revolutionary masses had a deeper understanding of the Japanese imperialist ambition to destroy China, and the will and activities to defend the motherland became more widespread and stronger. Reflected in the military, there were the Battle of Suiyuan, the Xi'an Incident, and the resistance at Lugouqiao. Reflected in the mass movement, there were the spontaneous emotions of mass donations and assistance to the war of resistance, as well as the continuous struggles of patriotic young people throughout the country. This series of facts are all inevitable developments of the national liberation movement, and are inevitable phenomena of the Chinese revolution that no one can stop. China launched a full-scale and protracted war for its own survival and world peace. It has now been a year and six months and has reached a new stage. In this new stage where the dawn is dawning and victory is in sight, commemorating the January 28th War of Resistance only makes us more excited and more confident. Looking back on these eighteen months, China is advancing towards the great road of the Three Principles of the People day by day, the war situation is becoming more and more favorable, and the soldiers on the front line are becoming more and more heroic. On the other hand, the enemy is on the verge of danger, morale is depressed, the international environment is deteriorating, and it has reached the point where the oil is exhausted and the lamp is dry, and it is impossible to clean up. Signs of a disastrous defeat have been revealed, and even if they try to make a final struggle, it will only be the final one. Although the facts are like this, we must not think that the enemy has no ability to attack, let alone think that sitting safely on an isolated island can wait for the arrival of light. We must know that the enemy's muddy feet are already deeply mired in the swamp, and they will inevitably exhaust their resources and make a desperate bet. At this time, we must be more vigilant, more striving, and more coordinated in thought and action to create the conditions for absolute victory and overcome this final difficulty. Then we will reach the blessed land of freedom and equality. Therefore, in commemorating the January 28th War of Resistance, we should (1) improve and enrich our work in our own positions. So-called efforts at work must not be considered sufficient if we only talk about business in business, talk about work in work, and talk about teaching in teaching. We must make all work beneficial to the war of resistance and national construction and conform to the principles of the Three People's Principles revolution. In other words, all work is revolutionary, progressive, and combative. (2) Intensify the mass organization and political education in the guerrilla areas. We believe that although the military work in the guerrilla areas of Jiangnan has developed considerably, the mass organization is not only inferior to the inland areas, but also inferior to the pre-war period. This is very regrettable. As for the political education of the Three People's Principles, it is a basic condition for the national revolution struggle, and it should be spontaneously intensified in all positions. (3) The frugal relief and donation campaign has already achieved considerable results. On this point, it is enough to show that the compatriots' patriotism has not waned for a long time. It is a pity that it is still limited to the middle and lower classes. The wealthy have not been able to fully fulfill their due responsibilities. It must be done more thoroughly on the frugal side. We should reflect deeply for the sake of national survival and our own future. If China is destroyed, what guarantee will there be for our lives and property, and what happy situation can we talk about? Isn't extravagance and decadence a great obstacle in the war of resistance? In short, we can only strive for a permanent happiness in the future with a short-term arduous struggle life and exhaust all our strength to make the donation and disaster relief movement expand day by day.

### Commemorating the War of Resistance, Posting Leaflets

The *North-China Daily News* reported that various leaflets were discovered in the central district of the Public Concession last night (26th), mostly pasted on telephone poles, printed with words such as "Commemorate January 28th, Save the Country Through Thrift," which were distributed by the Chinese side to commemorate the Songhu Anti-Japanese War.

### Telegram to the Central Government

In addition, the Municipal Party Headquarters sent a telegram to the Central Government, addressed to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing: This "January 28th" appropriately led to the rapid launch of the full-scale War of Resistance of "August 13th," however, due to the fact that the country was not yet united at that time, the "January 28th" War of Resistance had to end with the Songhu Agreement. Therefore, in commemorating this "January 28th" anniversary today, our Shanghai compatriots must first more resolutely and actively eliminate all elements of peace and compromise, and at the same time support national unity and the war of resistance to the end. Secondly, our war of resistance has entered a new stage. Although people still want to make a final desperate struggle and actively prepare for another line attack, either to the southwest or to the northwest, that attempt, as Chairman Chiang said, will inevitably suffer a major blow. Therefore, in this new stage of the war, we will also pay more attention to our occupied areas and guerrilla areas. Shanghai has been occupied for more than a year, and the guerrilla warfare in the suburbs of Shanghai is also actively unfolding. How should our Shanghai compatriots give active material and financial assistance to these heroic soldiers? We must know that the armed forces in the suburbs of Shanghai are the only force to recover Greater Shanghai and rescue our Shanghai compatriots from the fire and water, and the assistance of our Shanghai compatriots is the only force to contain the general offensive. In commemorating "January 28th," we must pay close attention to this. Our lives belong to the country, our fate depends on the fate of the country. We ask for a reasonable life, and we must first establish a reasonable new China. Victory in the war of resistance is the only condition for establishing a reasonable new China. Abandoning personal pleasures and going to the great righteousness of the war of resistance should be what every young compatriot should deeply encourage themselves. At the same time, due to the transformation of the war situation, the task of saving the country in Shanghai must concentrate all its strength on assisting the Third War Zone. How should our hundreds of thousands of young compatriots in Shanghai join the Third War Zone and become great soldiers? How should we temper our character, practice our skills, and prepare for national conscription in schools, factories, and even on the streets? These are all urgent matters that cannot be delayed. In addition, what the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters has announced to us, such as donating money, charity sales, mutual assistance and love, and sincere unity, is what our Shanghai compatriots should reflect on, be vigilant at all times, and never change in commemorating "January 28th" today. Shanghai compatriots, the final victory belongs to us. This is by no means an empty word. The domestic and international situation has moved step by step closer to this goal in the past year and a half. As long as we double the day we commemorate "January 28th" in Shanghai, it is appropriate to the time of our overall victory in the war of resistance. The Shanghai people, with sadness and anger, will enthusiastically donate money to taste the spirit of lying on firewood and sleeping on courage to seek success in the war of resistance and national construction. The land can be lost, but the will will never waver. People can be killed, but the integrity will never be lost. We will follow your instructions and fight to the end. We send this special telegram with respect and await the good news. Sincerely, All Shanghai Organizations.

### Declaration of Mass Organizations

Various mass organizations in the city issued a joint declaration commemorating January 28th, saying, Shanghai compatriots, today, when the Central Committee is holding the Fifth Plenary Session, we welcome the "January 28th" that first raised the banner of national resistance, we feel infinite joy and excitement. From Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's opening remarks, we can see its difficulty. It not only made the national policy of resisting Japan to the end more firm, but also laid the foundation for the development of the new China from then on. It swept away the tendencies of compromise and peace represented by Wang Jingwei since "January 28th." The bloody lessons of "January 28th" are very great. Without the local war of resistance of "January 28th," there would be no full-scale anti-Japanese war of "August 13th." Therefore, the first and most important thing for our Shanghai compatriots to do today is to more firmly and actively eliminate all elements of peace and compromise, and at the same time support national unity and the war of resistance to the end. Secondly, our war of resistance has entered a new stage. Although people still want to make a final desperate struggle and actively prepare for another line attack, either to the southwest or to the northwest, that attempt, as Chairman Chiang said, will inevitably suffer a major blow. Therefore, in this new stage of the war, we will also pay more attention to our occupied areas and guerrilla areas. Shanghai has become an isolated island, but today it is still the economic and cultural center of the country. Especially our wealthy compatriots who have come to Shanghai to take refuge are too numerous to count. We have long been familiar with the ancient saying that "If the skin does not exist, what will the hair cling to?" Relieving unemployment and relieving refugees is precisely the duty of every wealthy compatriot. Our central government has repeatedly shown us that the future of victory in the war of resistance is the thorough realization of the Three Principles of the People. Our supreme leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has recently announced to us how the gentry and celebrities throughout the country should actively lead the war of resistance. All of this proves that our fellow compatriots in Shanghai today are relieving unemployment and refugees, which is also striving for a bright future for ourselves in the future. Further, after the war, Shanghai has gathered 4 million compatriots, and many of them are our young compatriots. Youth is the pillar of the country, and the backbone of defending the country. For the past year and a half, the young compatriots in Shanghai have been running around calling out and working hard for the country. Their bravery and enthusiasm have been admired by the world. However, our compatriots cannot ignore that some young compatriots are still indulging in singing and dancing, and even despise their own lives because of unrequited love. Our Shanghai young compatriots must understand that in this war, we must work hard, unite, then, today we come to commemorate "January 28th", tomorrow, we can raise the cup of victory. The Shanghai Municipal Mass Organizations Declaration.

### Charity Sales and Donations from the Business Community

Today is the January 28th anniversary, the Shanghai business community issued a letter to the city's business community, saying, Fellow compatriots in the city's business community, today is the most memorable festival for our country to struggle for survival in a difficult environment and start action. There was the awakening on this day seven years ago, followed by the tragic and loyal construction of the country seven years later. History is evolutionary, and an enlightened nation should have the spirit of never giving up and taking on heavy responsibilities and reaching far. What should we do on this most memorable festival today? First, is to hang flags at half-mast, which shows that our Shanghai has temporarily become an isolated island, but the country has not left us, and we support the country with even more enthusiasm. Everyone should remember to live a tense and serious life in tragedy and loyalty. Second, at 12 o'clock noon today, be silent for three minutes to mourn the martyrs of our country today seven years ago, and the tens of thousands of patriots who are dedicating their precious lives to the Chinese nation today seven years later. Compatriots are building a bright and splendid future, we should commemorate them, we should follow them. Third, our business community should hold charity sales today and donate the proceeds to the country. We people hiding on the isolated island, seeing the compatriots across the country fighting for the survival of the motherland and fighting for national freedom, can we forget that we are also a part of the country? A part of the Chinese nation? Never, never. Then we should do our best to be a small soldier participating in the struggle. We are limited by the current environment and cannot contribute our bodies to the country, then we should also contribute our financial resources to the country. Even if we cannot contribute the entire financial resources to the country, we should also contribute as much as possible. As for the method of charity sales and donations, it is very simple. Just mark the words "Charity Sale Today" at the door, and stamp the charity sale pattern on the invoice, and remit all the proceeds to the government the next morning, and you have fulfilled the responsibility of a patriotic businessman.

### Youth Organizations

In addition, the Three People's Principles Youth League, the Shanghai Student Federation, and the National Salvation Youth League, and other three groups, have all issued notices to compatriots, unanimously firming their confidence, supporting the supreme leader, upholding the spirit of perseverance and struggle, working hard, and having the certainty of final victory. Facts have proven that it is by no means a false statement. I hope compatriots, do not be lazy and negligent.

### Expect the People of the Whole Country to Hand in Gold and Silver to the Government. It is Unwise for Private Individuals to Purchase Gold and Silver. The Order to Prohibit Purchases Aims to Increase Reserves. The Government Ships Them Out to Exchange for Foreign Exchange to Stabilize Finance.

Our government promulgated the measures for exchanging gold for legal tender after the war, as well as the implementing rules, and supervised the measures for silver shops to collect gold. It telegraphed chambers of commerce and silver shops in various places to prohibit private purchases of gold and silver. Gold and silver collection offices were established in various places, aiming to control gold and silver, increase foreign exchange reserves, and consolidate the legal tender base. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective.

Now the Ministry of Finance said that the future of the silver relationship is related to the national monetary system. Since 1931, various countries have successively adopted the managed currency standard system, and the government's centralized gold has become a general trend. Even in the United States, which has a lot of gold, private individuals can only gold, but cannot buy gold. The right to buy gold and transport gold is controlled by the government. London is the only one in the world.

Free Trade

Gold market, however, in addition to overseas buyers, and London merchants' exports, or for British and American exchange with the London New Gold market arbitrage, the Bank of England must also find ways to neutralize and control the number of gold reserves in the general financial market, because it is sufficient to affect the credit of the market. Silver is one of the commodities in foreign markets. In 1934, the United States implemented

National Policy on Silver

After the implementation, the price has improved quite a bit, but since the spring of 1936, the world silver price has tended to fall again. If there is no support from the US government's silver purchase policy, the decline will be even more drastic. As for the gold and silver prices, and the changes in foreign exchange, there is a related relationship. All purchases of gold and silver for private profit, or even speculation and manipulation of the market, violate national policy, which affects

Wartime Finance

The relationship is extremely important. Therefore, the ministry's order to prohibit private purchases of gold and silver is a crucial policy for stabilizing finance and strengthening the war of resistance. At the same time, it is hoped that the people of the country will hand in gold and silver to the government. The government gathers it and ships it abroad, sells it at a fixed price or at a public market price, and exchanges it for foreign exchange, which is a huge subsidy to the national finance. It is unwise for private individuals to purchase gold and silver from the standpoint of personal storage of wealth, and it is detrimental to the national interest, which is of no benefit to them.

### Citizens' Group Donates Money, Broadcast Reports

It is scheduled to report by broadcasting this morning, Lin Kanghou and others made speeches to express their thanks.

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Citizens Group Solicitation Committee, the various recognized donations received during the broadcasting period have now been statistically completed. In addition to printing a credit list for credit purposes, it is specifically scheduled to broadcast reports from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm today at the Daya Radio Station. The committee members who will go to the radio station to make speeches of thanks include Tao Leqin, Cao Zhigong, and Zhang Yichen at 10:00 am, Lin Kanghou and Zhou Bangjun at 6:00 pm, and Liu Zhongying and Ge Fuchu at 12:00 pm. If there are any errors in the donation report, donors are requested to notify and correct them. In addition, Zhou Bangjun, a member of the standing committee of the association, continued to donate 1,000 yuan yesterday.

In addition to obtaining a formal receipt, it was also sent to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association.

### Rumors of a Kidnapping on Avenue Edward VII, Even Claiming the Victim Was Shao Lizi; Investigation Reveals Shao Himself Has Not Been to Shanghai

It is rumored that a kidnapping occurred near Avenue Edward VII and Dahua Road around 10 AM the day before yesterday. Upon investigation by reporters, it is generally stated that the victim was a man around fifty years old, who appeared to be waiting for a tram at that location. Suddenly, a car arrived with about ten people inside. The car stopped at the intersection of Dahua Road, and those inside got out, pushing and pulling the victim into the car and driving away. However, there is no record of this case with the Public Concession police. Inquiries to the police department also yielded no information. Therefore, the reliability of this case and the identity of the victim remain unconfirmed for now.

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," simple information obtained this morning (the 27th) indicates that a high-ranking official of the Nationalist government was kidnapped by Japanese individuals yesterday morning at 10 AM and detained at the Delin Apartments on North Sichuan Road. Furthermore, according to several sources, the victim is Shao Lizi, the recently resigned Minister of Propaganda and member of the Central Executive Committee. Two Japanese men in formal attire, accompanied by ten Chinese individuals, arrived in three cars at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Dahua Road, entered a residence, and abducted a certain Hua Lai official over fifty years old. It is said that when the Japanese entered, the official was still in bed. The Japanese ordered him to dress and took him to the Delin Apartments. Although it is rumored that the kidnapped person is Shao Lizi, his identity has not been confirmed as of this morning. (This newspaper's investigation in various directions has confirmed that Mr. Shao is currently residing safely in Chongqing.)

### Mining in War Zones: Urgent Plans for Restoration

The Ministry of Economic Affairs Dispatches Personnel to Inspect War Zones

Weng Wenhao, Director of the Readjustment Committee of Industry and Mining of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, believes that mineral production in the southwestern provinces is now largely underway. However, the mining industry in the rear areas of the southeastern, central China, and northwestern war zones is either already being exploited but currently suspended or has not yet been exploited. To increase resources, he recently formulated development measures, offered special incentives, and, in conjunction with the Resources Committee, dispatched personnel to inspect the rear areas of Zhejiang East, Jiangsu North, and Anhui South war zones. The goal is to enable the mining industry in the war zones to quickly achieve restoration and increase production.

### Citibank Denies Using "Federal Reserve" Currency

Spokesperson Absolutely Denies the Japanese Domei News Agency Report as Pure Fabrication; Hopes Chinese People Will Not Credulously Believe It

Yesterday, the Shanghai Times of this port reported a Domei News Agency dispatch stating that Citibank in Tianjin had decided to henceforth use paper money from the United Reserve Bank and other banks in North China to pay out withdrawals. A special reporter from this newspaper immediately inquired with Citibank in Shanghai about the veracity of this news. A spokesperson for the bank replied that it was absolutely unfounded and hoped that the Chinese people would not credulously believe it.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Funing Hexing Town, Obstructing Foreign Shipping

The Haida Was Loading and Unloading Cargo When the Alarm Sounded; It Fled to the Yanghe Estuary

Funing Hexing Town in Jiangbei is currently a key hub connecting canal transportation in northern Jiangsu. Before August 13th, only the Hey Zhong Company's Muyou vessel operated there, and business was normal. After the Japanese army broke through the Jiangyin blockade line, the Yangtze River came under control, disrupting traffic between the north and south banks of the Yangtze. Later, along the river, foreign merchants gradually resumed transportation. However, they were still unable to penetrate inland. Subsequently, Jardine Matheson, Italian companies, etc., dispatched vessels to facilitate the transport of goods to northern Jiangsu. However, the waterway inside the Yanghe estuary is shallow, and ships with deeper drafts cannot navigate it. Therefore, Jardine Matheson gave up. Currently, the Yongli Company's Yongzhen, the Fucheng Company's Hafa, and the recently organized Northern Jiangsu United Transportation Company's Haida and other vessels operate there, with flourishing cargo transport. Yesterday, this newspaper received a telegram from Hexing Town stating that the day before yesterday (the 26th) morning, a Japanese plane came to reconnaissance and dropped more than ten small bombs. Several foreign sheds (i.e., grass sheds and warehouses along the river) were destroyed, although the losses were still minimal, the public was greatly alarmed. When the Japanese plane dropped bombs, the Haida vessels were loading and unloading cargo, so they raised anchor and fled to the Yanghe estuary. They were originally scheduled to return to Shanghai tomorrow, or perhaps arrive in port today. It is heard that a Japanese warship is anchored outside the Yanghe estuary, its movements unclear. It is said that after the Haida vessel returns to Shanghai, it may be diverted to Wenzhou.

### Fifth War Zone Cultural Work

Establishing a Cultural Work Committee and Organizing Cultural Guerrilla Units

After the fall of Shanghai, most of China's cultural figures moved inland to work. According to news from cultural circles in this port, these cultural figures who have moved inland, because the second phase of the War of Resistance focuses on guerrilla warfare, Qian Jiarui, Sha Qianli, and others have established a Cultural Work Committee in the Fifth War Zone. They are engaged in organizing cultural guerrilla units to penetrate into the guerrilla areas.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Direct Shipping: Hope for Restoration

Regarding the issue of restoring direct shipping on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, after the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association and others repeatedly appealed to the Zhejiang Provincial military authorities, it was brought up for discussion at a shipping affairs meeting convened by the 　 Group Army Headquarters in Jinhua on the 27th of last month. It was approved in principle, and opinions were drafted and submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for review. However, it has been a month since then, and there has been no news of approval for restoration. According to Xie Baosheng, a representative of the Xin'an Transport Company who had just returned to Shanghai from Jinhua, the issue of direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo has recently been reiterated by various parties, requesting early implementation. The 　 Group Army Headquarters has expressed its willingness to accept it and has obtained the approval of Commander Gu. It is heard that it has been stipulated that the limit will be two ships per day. The first step is to order the foreign vessels that have been approved to sail to Ningbo to first conduct measurement and registration at the Ningbo Shipping Administration Office. Once the measurement procedures are completed, they will be submitted to the 　 Group Army for review and then forwarded to the provincial government for investigation, and direct shipping can be formally restored. Therefore, the realization of the plan is not far off.

### Pudong Residents Present a Banner to Ding Xisan

Ding Xisan, commander of the 8th Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, has inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese army since leading his troops in the War of Resistance. It is now known that the residents of various places along the north and south banks of the Huangpu River, in gratitude for Ding's meritorious service in resisting Japan and protecting the people over the past year, specially made a silk command banner and presented it to Ding. The presentation ceremony was held in the square of the detachment headquarters in a certain place the day before yesterday.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses Salary Increase Meeting; Taxpaying Westerners Express Themselves Frankly

Unanimously Criticizing the Unfair Salary Increase Method; Also Criticizing the Actions of Mr. Milchell

According to the Continental Daily News, the business community representative committee investigating the salary increase of senior officials of the Shanghai Municipal Council held a meeting yesterday (the 26th) afternoon to listen to the opinions of four Western taxpayers. Mr. Milchell, one of the committee members, namely the chairman of the Municipal Council's Personnel Committee, was not present. It was learned last night that the committee chairman Hawkins had suggested to Mr. Milchell that he did not need to attend, so Mr. Milchell was absent. Mr. Milchell is a member of the Municipal Council committee responsible for handling the salary increase of senior officials. The meeting held yesterday started at 4 PM and ended at 5 PM. The Western taxpayers who attended were Li Delili, Ji Xumu, Ford, and Shi Dehua. All four expressed their opinions and provided some information to the meeting. First, Ford delivered a speech, saying that since the Shanghai Municipal Council's finances are ample, the Personnel Committee can hire a mathematician to determine a fair and impartial salary amount. The Public Concession's police department and fire brigade were originally quite good, but although the personnel are the same, the results are lower than before. Chinese and Western employees alike lack enthusiasm for their work. This proposed salary increase intends to increase the salaries of a small number of officials substantially, while the Municipal Council does not pay much attention to many low-paid officials. Therefore, I believe that the best way to solve this problem is to increase salaries by 20% across the board, regardless of position. Next, Li Delili delivered a speech, saying that the economic situation in the Public Concession has not been good in recent years. Not long ago, the Municipal Council's Public Works Department and Fire Brigade laid off twenty or thirty Western employees, which seriously affected the work of those two departments. In 1936, in order to cope with the reduction in income, the Municipal Council implemented an 8% salary reduction for all levels of personnel. Those with generous salaries were not affected, only the low-level employees suffered. Last July, the implementation of adjustment measures also only benefited the higher-level officials, and the percentage of salary increases for high and low-level officials this time differs greatly, which is unfair. Therefore, please consider the following points: when the Municipal Council hires higher-level officials, it does not allow for foreign exchange subsidies. Why should senior personnel receive substantial salary increases, while low-level officials are not given the same proportion of salary subsidies? Foreigners come to work in China's concessions, and their income all comes from the residents. Furthermore, at this time when the Public Concession's market is withering, it is incomprehensible why they should demand payment in foreign currency. The Chinese police receive the lowest pay. Even if their salaries are increased by 50%, it would not be excessive. The same should be done for firefighters and the White Russian regiment, as the safety of the residents depends on their protection. Because of insufficient income, the Municipal Council has increased vehicle license fees by 10%, and the patrol police donation has increased from 14% to 16%. Are these tax increases and the savings after layoffs being used to fill the pockets of a few individuals? Next, Ji Xumu spoke, saying that if the Municipal Council feels that it is economically well-off and can increase the salaries of employees, why not first cancel the 8% salary reduction implemented a year ago and then consider temporary subsidies? Since the salary increase is due to the high cost of living in this port, why do senior officials receive increases of 60% to 80%, while the police and fire brigade personnel, who are similarly affected by the high cost of living, only receive a 3% salary increase? Finally, Shi Dehua delivered a speech, roughly saying that we must pay attention to the two Municipal Council committees related to the salary increase incident. One is the Employee Economic Committee, which was formally concluded the year before last, but the committee had a fair report. The other is the Personnel Committee, which handles all matters related to the Municipal Council's employees and is one of the Municipal Council's standing committees. Last year, it was rumored that several relevant figures attempted to destroy the Employee Economic Committee's report. The Personnel Committee, chaired by Mr. Milchell, passed a resolution on July 26th of last year, first formally proving that the report had been destroyed. The resolution attacked and destroyed the exchange rate adjustment principles and other important clauses stipulated in the report. On December 23rd, the Personnel Committee passed another resolution, increasing the salaries of "A" level officials from 14% to 100%. However, when the taxpayers found out, they were quite angry. The Municipal Council had to form this special committee to mediate. However, Mr. Milchell was one of the members who signed the Employee Economic Committee's report. Mr. Milchell was also the leading figure who criticized this report. Why is it that Mr. Milchell is also in an important position in this special committee of business community representatives? The main members of the Employee Economic Committee, Fan Keling and Kaisihui, have remained silent throughout. Therefore, the most important thing for the taxpayers now is to have Fan and Kai be involved in this matter and to ask them to carefully consider the opinions and facts submitted to the meeting. The taxpayers' reaction to this salary increase incident is that those who do not need assistance are arbitrarily given substantial salary increases, while those who receive the lowest salaries are not given assistance. Therefore, please consider the employees with the lowest salaries. This salary increase greatly exceeds the salary amount stipulated in the report, increasing annual expenses by at least one million yuan. Taxpayers absolutely cannot bear this burden under this situation.

Shanghai Special Edition

### Retrospect and Prospect of Accounting Academic Studies and Accounting Profession in Our Country (Continued)

— Pan Xulun

Looking back at the decade from 1927 to 1937, the rate of progress in domestic accounting academic studies and the accounting profession was quite astonishing. More than ten years ago, many people in the country did not understand what an accountant was as a profession, but now the business of accountants is more common than before. More than ten years ago, government industrial and commercial organizations regarded the position of accountant as on par with clerical staff, and relatives and friends were only required to be slightly literate and could be entrusted with the position. Now, most organizations hire accounting staff through examinations. Those who are not well-versed in learning have no hope of taking office. In these ten years, accounting has become a specialized profession, on par with medicine, engineering, law, and other professions.

(III)

In the autumn of 1937, China's industrial and commercial enterprises were extremely prosperous, and national construction was advancing rapidly by leaps and bounds. Accounting academic studies and the accounting profession were in an unprecedented golden age when the war suddenly broke out in Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai. In the year and a half since then, the shifting battlefields have caused half of the country to fall into the hands of the enemy. The transportation, industry, and commerce in the southeast and Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai have been destroyed by artillery fire and seized by the enemy, accounting for eighty or ninety percent. For a time, accounting specialists suddenly felt unemployed. However, the study of accounting academic studies has not experienced too much stagnation. In the past year, there have been more than ten new and revised translations of accounting books, the content of which is more advanced than before. The number of students studying accounting in universities, vocational schools, and cram schools in Shanghai is no less than that before the war. On the other hand, accounting education has rapidly advanced in Hong Kong and Chongqing, which is due to the needs of construction in the inland areas.

Looking ahead, the southeastern coastal provinces have always been the most developed areas for accounting academic studies and the accounting profession. However, due to the war, they may not be able to restore their former glory in the short term. However, in recent years, the scope of international economic assistance in the southwestern provinces has been widening. Under the direct leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the Southwest Economic Construction Committee's development of the southwest will surely achieve remarkable results in one or two years. It is almost inevitable that these new ventures will apply new accounting methods. If so, the development of the accounting profession has a great future, and the need for research in accounting academic studies is urgent, and progress will be rapid. Specifically, in terms of region, the development of the accounting profession and academic studies that was in the southeast will now change places and go to the southwest. This kind of regional change also shows us the direction of future efforts.

To further discuss it, in three to five years, when the war is won, construction will be widespread throughout the country, and its scale will be unprecedented in Chinese history. At that time, China's accounting profession and academic studies will develop like never before, and it is not impossible to surpass the United Kingdom and the United States.

### Nantong Industrialist Mr. Zhang Tui'an Passes Away

Nantong industrialist Mr. Zhang Tui'an passed away yesterday at his residence in Shanghai. The funeral will be held tomorrow at the China Funeral Home. At that time, there will be many people in plain cars and white horses who will come to offer their condolences. A reporter visited last night and saw that the arrangements were already in place. I asked about Mr. Zhang's life experience and condition during his illness. The person in charge answered in great detail. It is recorded below.

Early Political Career

Mr. Zhang's name is 　, a native of Nantong. He studied with his younger brother, Mr. Jizhi, in his youth. Later, he became a guest of Wu Zhuangong and stationed troops in Korea, working with Yuan Shikai. During the Guangxu period, he was recommended as a county magistrate for military merit and served as magistrate of Guixi and Yichun in Jiangxi. Wherever he went, he was honest and upright in his administration and inspection of officials, and the people praised him. Since his younger brother founded the Dasheng Cotton Mill in his hometown and summoned him to help, he left the political arena, and the name of Nantong's industry was passed down to the world along with the spirit of Mr. Zhang and his brothers.

Revitalizing Industry

Dasheng expanded from one factory to two, three, and eight factories. Dasheng also expanded to other industries, such as Kuangsheng Oil Mill, Fuxing Flour Mill, Zisheng Iron Factory, Dada Ocean Transport, and inland river steamers. Salt land reclamation was particularly important, such as Tonghai Company, Dayou Jin Company, Dayu Company, Dafeng Company, etc. The history of their operation has lasted for forty years. Although the situation is different now and the results vary, the grand plan they created at that time is indelible.

Donating One Million

Mr. Zhang was honest and upright in nature and decisive in handling affairs. Whenever there were major local events, he could often resolve them with a single word. It is said that there are two points that are most commendable: (1) Mr. Zhang always donated the profits earned from various industries each year to education, charity, and public welfare in Nantong. According to the records, the amount donated by him and his brothers reached several million yuan, which can be said to conform to the saying of accumulating wealth and being able to distribute it in our country.

Consistent in Poverty and Success

(2) Since 1921, Nantong's industry has been declining day by day, leading to economic difficulties and unsustainable businesses. The brothers still maintained their original aspirations and worked diligently, discussing and proceeding with various parties, even to the point of being hoarse and exhausted, and their enthusiasm never wavered. This is what Western philosophers call being consistent in poverty and success.

Studying Buddhism in His Later Years

In the past ten years, Mr. Zhang has freed himself from all businesses and no longer participated in them. He only assisted in one or two charitable institutions that could not be interrupted to the best of his ability. He lived in seclusion in Shanghai, often suffering from illnesses, writing scriptures, chanting Buddhist scriptures, and trying to spend the rest of his years. After the summer of last year, he often lay in bed. Western and Chinese medicine were administered daily, but because he was already eighty-eight years old, his energy was weak, and it was ineffective. This month, he gradually entered a state of confusion, warning his son, Jingli, not to issue an obituary or hold a wake after his death. He passed away with a smile at ten o'clock in the afternoon of the 26th while his family chanted Buddhist scriptures. When the reporter visited, he saw a mourning couplet written by his nephew, Zhang Rongwu, hanging on the white curtain. It is recorded as follows: 壎　interacted, sharing the joys and sorrows of our ancestors. How can we write about the ultimate virtue? Thinking of his laughter, thinking of his residence, the standards are passed down from generation to generation. The fatherly kindness and compassion still exist, and the pure customs are not lost. Engrave them on the tripods and bells, engrave them on the banners.

### After the Kai Bo Ship Sank, the Crew Still Remained in Taiwan Yesterday

Waiting for the Martial Law Department to Summon Them to Inquire About the Loss; They Can Take a Ship Back to Shanghai After the Investigation is Completed

The Kailong Shipping Company's Kai Bo vessel, chartered by the Ning-Shao Transport Company of this city, loaded coal from Wenzhou and sailed to Ningbo. It ran aground and sank on the outer Diaoban waters near Haimen at 2:30 AM on the 25th. Fortunately, all sixty-odd Chinese and foreign crew members, including Olsen, Zhou Yanyi, and Zhang Yunquan, were rescued and safely arrived in Taiwan. They telegraphed to report their safety. They were originally scheduled to take the Haifu vessel back to Shanghai from Haimen on the 26th, but yesterday morning, the Ning-Shao Company received another telegram from the crew, stating roughly that the Wenzhou-Taiwan Martial Law Headquarters needed to inquire in detail about the loss of the Kai Bo vessel, so it instructed the captain and all crew members to stay in Haimen temporarily and await summons. They will be allowed to take a ship back to Shanghai after the case is clarified. It is heard that the company has informed the families of the crew members of the telegram to allay their concerns.

### Shanghai Municipal Bank: Reliable News of Repaying Deposits

The Shanghai Municipal Bank has been closed for nearly a year. Depositors have sent dozens of letters and telegrams to the bank's board of directors, Mayor Yu, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to request their deposits. Now, depositors Wang Guiying and others have received Directive No. 1654 from the Chongqing Ministry of Finance, which states: "Your telegram has been received. The Shanghai Municipal Bank has raised funds to repay deposits and has been ordered by the Ministry to handle the matter in accordance with the measures for stabilizing finance. You may directly contact the bank to handle the matter. This directive is signed by Minister Kong Xiangxi." This means that the bank has indeed raised funds to repay depositors' deposits, without any doubt. It is heard that the bank is currently verifying the amount of depositors' deposits and all procedures for repayment. Once the plan is completed, it will announce the date of repayment.

### Japanese Newspaper Supports the "Puppet Municipal Government," Actually Undermining the Shanghai Municipal Council, Adopting a挑挑挑挑挑挑挑挑挑挑挑挑挑挑Attitude

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," today (the 27th), the Japanese-language "Continental New News" sells out the Shanghai Municipal Council and adopts a挑挑挑挑挑挑挑挑挑挑挑挑挑挑attitude, hindering the actions of the "Shanghai Special Municipality." According to the newspaper, Mr. K, the assistant police commissioner of the police department, has notified the director of the western district of the "Shanghai Special Municipality" that he has been ordered to prohibit puppet police from entering and passing through the alleys on both sides of the boundary roads. "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoan learned of this and inquired with Mr. Fan Keling, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Mr. Fan stated that he had not heard of this matter but would investigate it. It is also rumored that at a meeting held a few days ago, the Shanghai Municipal Council passed a resolution not to recognize the puppet "Renovation Government's" collection of salt taxes on the boundary roads. This move has intensified the dispute. Because of this, the Shanghai Municipal Council not only does not recognize the salt tax but also does not recognize all other taxes. The newspaper concludes that at a time when the closure of the police station in the western district has not been resolved, the Shanghai Municipal Council's attitude is causing unnecessary disputes, and the "Renovation Government" is seriously considering it.

### China Eye Protection Association Promotes Eye Protection Movement

The China Eye Protection Association is a purely health-related academic organization. The association was jointly initiated and organized by optics experts from Maochang Optical Company and ophthalmologists Zhang Xiqi, Zhu Pinsan, etc. Its purpose is to promote eye health among the general public and to study optical knowledge in order to protect eyesight and treat eye diseases, so as to develop an eye protection movement to enhance national health. Anyone who agrees with the association's purpose can join as an ordinary member without paying any fees. Since the association was established, more than 1,700 people have joined, which shows that all sectors of society have a deep understanding of this eye protection movement. The association, in view of the prevalence of eye diseases among Chinese people and the widespread prevalence of trachoma, which is a major obstacle to national health, has established an ophthalmology clinic at 547 Xiafei Road, specializing in providing free diagnosis and treatment of all eye diseases for the general public. Outpatient appointments do not require consultation fees, only a very low registration fee. Dozens of people go to the clinic every day for diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases or eye examinations, which can be said to be a practical welfare undertaking that benefits the public and has been praised by all sectors. Now, the association has reprinted the "Love Your Eyes" special publication in the hope of making more effective publicity for the eye protection movement. The "Love Your Eyes" special publication has rich content, all of which are works written by famous ophthalmologists and optics experts. It is beautifully printed, the language is simple, and the content is interesting. It can be said to be the only publication for studying eye health knowledge. The publication is free of charge and can be obtained from the China Eye Protection Association at 775 Nanjing Road or the Maochang Optical Company's main branch.

### Caojiadu Dark and Dreary: Thugs Shoot and Kill a Soil Merchant, Wang Xiumu Dies on the Spot

The area near Caojiadu in western Shanghai has seen a surge in flower clubs, gambling dens, and opium dens since the beginning of winter, attracting hordes of ruffians and bandits who see it as a source of profit. These people appear and disappear unpredictably, taking advantage of the "three-no-zone" situation and treating it as a paradise. As a result, illegal activities frequently occur in this border area, and they are even becoming increasingly common. Recently, the concession authorities have taken strict measures, preventing these people from crossing the border, so they have mostly concentrated in the Wujiaochang area of Caojiadu. However, due to

Conflicts of Interest

these people often quarrel among themselves, even resorting to violence, resulting in bloody incidents. Recently, a large shipment of narcotics was imported into the area, leading to a proliferation of opium dens and drug dens. However, those involved each have their own gangs and are contracted to promote sales, leading to mutual deception and deep suspicion. As a result, incidents such as intercepting vehicles and gathering gangs to rob soil have occurred. Retaliation goes back and forth endlessly. No. 6 Dingcaili, Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, has a storefront called Jinxing Cotton Cloth Shop, but in reality, it is a

Soil Trafficking Organization

The person in charge is a Shandong rogue named Wang Xiumu, 41 years old. Because he widely recruits followers, he has a considerable evil influence in the area. The day before yesterday, Wang had just transported a large quantity of opium from Tianjin. Unexpectedly, this was discovered by Liu Dianyuan (also known as Tianjin Liu San), a Tianjin gang rogue in the area, who thought there was profit to be made. So, the day before yesterday, he demanded money from Wang. Wang was no kind person, so he refused to comply, causing Liu and Wang to

Lose Control and Break Up

After the incident, Liu harbored deep resentment. So, yesterday morning, he led his henchmen, each carrying a pistol, to Dingyeli to take revenge. At the time, Wang was chatting with someone in the living room. When he saw Liu and his gang barging in, he knew things were not good and was about to run away. But Liu had already ordered his henchmen to open fire. So, the group of guns fired together, aiming at Wang Xiumu. Two shots hit Wang's vital parts (one in the chest, one in the abdomen).

Falling to the Ground Dead

Seeing that their goal had been achieved, Liu led his murderous henchmen away with a howl. After the incident, the Concession Police Department immediately ordered detectives to rush to the border area to suppress and search, to prevent the gangsters from mixing in. The pseudo-"police" and Japanese and Italian soldiers also arrived at the scene. Other than a brief inquiry and taking Wang's body away by car, no action was taken.

### Gu Zhongguang Colludes with Petty Thieves to Steal Wheat

### Fuxin Flour Mill Wheat Stolen, Detectives Discover and Arrest Twenty People

The wheat used by Fuxin Flour Mill is mostly sourced from the Tongzhou area of northern Jiangsu. Over the years, the quantity used has been quite large. The transportation procedures along the way have always been contracted to the Kerry Navigation Company at No. 17 Guangdong Road. After the wheat arrives in Shanghai, Kerry Company subcontracts the transportation to Shuncheng Transportation Company at Room 7, No. 209 Nanjing Road. Because the quantity is so large and the transportation procedures are troublesome, Shuncheng Company also distributes the transportation to various truck companies in Shanghai. According to regulations, the wheat is loaded onto trucks directly from the wharf to the various Fuxin factories. Unexpectedly, Tang Jian, Tang Zhihong, Wang Jinsheng, and Han Kaiyuan, detectives of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, have recently learned that a group of

Petty Thieves

specialize in using the loading and unloading time to collude with drivers and small workers to repack the wheat, reduce the quantity, and privately sell the stolen wheat for their own use. This has been going on for a long time, and a lot of wheat has been stolen. Moreover, more and more people are involved. So, they immediately began an investigation. Since the 8th of this month, they have successively arrested the suspects Bao Gengsheng, Bai Rushou, Che Xiaomao, Zhang Jinqing, Gu Zhongguang, Wu Yonglang, Sun Afu, Zhang Are, Ding Lujun, Yang Yukun, Cai Shoubai, Chen Zhongqing, Liu Jinkui, Wang Shihua, Wang Yijun, Li Songtang, Zhao Changsheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Lu Laowu, Lu Shuangshuang, Zhou Ronggui, etc., a total of twenty-one people, and confiscated

More Than Thirty Bags

of wheat. Except for Wang Yijun, who was released because he was not involved, the other twenty people were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court the morning before yesterday. The defendants hired lawyers such as Fan Gang, Jiang Chiping, and Yu Enliang to defend them in court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stood up and requested that the compulsory detention of the sixteenth defendant, Li Songtang, be revoked. However, since he still needs to testify, he should be ordered to post bail. The court approved the request. Then, Lawyer Li gave a detailed account of the case, stating that Wang Yaochen, the general manager of Fuxin No. 7 Flour Mill, lives at No. 18 Miaolong Lane, Jing'an Temple Road. The defendants Liu Jinkui and Wang Shihua are Wang Yaochen's bodyguards. Another defendant, Zhang Jinqing, is a

Gate Guard

of Miaolong. The defendant Gu Zhongguang has always bought wheat at the dock, so he is familiar with the truck drivers and small workers. Over time, they colluded with each other to commit fraud. Gu Zhongguang and the gate guard Zhang Jinqing rented a spare room at No. 12 Miaolong B, paying eight yuan a month, to use as a place to store the wheat, and paid Zhang a reward of ten yuan a month. The method of theft is that Gu and others collude with the truck drivers and small workers to not transport the loaded wheat directly to the Fuxin factory, but first transport it to the Miaolong agency. The time is always at night (because the gate guard Zhang Jinqing

covets small profits

and asked the owner to change to the long night shift, to facilitate the fraud). The wheat is repackaged, and each bag of sixty bags can hold two more bags. Gu pays seven and a half yuan for each extra bag, with two yuan going to the driver, one yuan each to the four small workers, and one and a half yuan as an introduction fee. From December 13th last year to the 8th of this month, out of 22,000 bags, 281 bags were stolen. The bodyguards Liu and Wang sold them to Shen Baozhang, the receiving director of Fuxin, for a price of more than fourteen yuan per bag, and divided the profits for their own use. The case still needs to be investigated, so they requested a postponement. Judge Xiao ordered the defendants to be detained for seven days for further questioning.

### Cloth Shop Colludes with Japanese to Defraud Merchants

They Not Only Deceived Them of Their Money But Also Kidnapped Them, Escaping and Filing a Complaint in Court

Dai Zixiang and Wang Shanbo, residents of No. 6 Yude Lane, Yunnan Road, natives of Funing, hired lawyer Sun Fucheng to represent them and filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against their fellow villagers Chen Pengshi and Xue Guorui (resident of No. 13 Leyi Lane, Annakin Road, French Concession) for fraud, requesting an investigation, and attached a civil suit. Their complaint stated that the plaintiffs had been doing business in their hometown and recently came to Shanghai to

Purchase Small Pieces of Cloth

to transport back for sale. When they set off in their hometown, Xue Guohui, the second defendant's younger brother, told the plaintiffs that his brother Xue Guorui was the manager of Chen Tianxiang Cloth Shop, which Chen Pengshi had set up at Leyi Lane, Annakin Road, and that he could introduce them, saying the price of the goods was cheap. So, the plaintiffs believed him and went to Chen Tianxiang Cloth Shop with Guohui on December 19th of last year, and with the first and second defendants

Agreed on the Price

of one hundred yuan per load, a total of eight loads, and paid eight hundred yuan to the defendants, agreeing to deliver the goods the next day. But they knew that the defendants had already stopped doing business. The next day, there were no goods to deliver. Until the 25th of the same month, the defendants not only did not deliver the goods, but also colluded with the Japanese to falsely accuse the plaintiffs of being guerrillas. The Japanese then hired a car from the Yunfei Automobile Branch of the Mainland Business Center to come, like a kidnapping, and

Dragged Them Onto the Car

to Hongkou. When they reached the southern end of the Waibaidu Bridge, while the Japanese were at the northern end of the bridge, they were able to escape and return without being harmed. Only then did they realize they had been deceived. They then negotiated with the defendants and were taken to the police station, promising to deliver the goods. But until now, they still have not delivered the goods. Helpless, they filed a lawsuit requesting a legal investigation. Based on the complaint, Judge Wu Kechou

Opened Court to Hear the Case

Yesterday morning. First, the plaintiffs stated what happened. When questioned, Chen Pengshi stated that Xue Chunqiu, Xue Guorui's nephew, actually bought the confiscated goods in Hongkou. As a result, the payment for the goods was taken by Xue Chunqiu and had nothing to do with the woman. Xue Guorui stated that the plaintiffs were with the son of his brother Xue Guobiao, wanting to go to Hongkou to buy small pieces of cloth. Now, Xue Chunqiu

Whereabouts Unknown

He does not know where he is. Recently, Xue Chunqiu's father asked him to reconcile with the plaintiffs on his behalf, but he knew nothing else. He also hired a lawyer to defend him and filed a countersuit for false accusation. After verifying the confessions in court, each was ordered to pay a deposit of six hundred yuan. The plaintiffs also posted bail, and the hearing was adjourned to a later date.

### Immoral Young Man Overindulges in Lust, Overdoses on Aphrodisiacs

Collapses on Bed, Unconscious, Sent to Hospital, Life in Danger

Xu Huaifang, a young man around twenty years old, residing at No. 124 Yuguang Village, Yuyuan Road, is fond of lust. On the 25th of this month, Xu and several friends went to the fourth floor of the Yangzi Hotel, Yunfu Road, and opened room 416 to play around, widely soliciting female escorts to indulge in pleasure. That night, Xu stayed alone in the room and kept a female escort for the night. It is inevitable that improper behavior will occur when a single man and woman live in the same room. After one night, at twelve o'clock noon on the 26th, Xu suddenly had lewd thoughts again and planned to call another female escort for immoral acts. However, because Xu had overindulged in lust the night before, his energy was exhausted. He was afraid that he would not be able to perform temporarily and would not be able to please the other party. So, he devised a way to obtain two bottles of aphrodisiacs and swallowed them all, satisfied that he would be able to achieve satisfactory results. After taking the medicine, he was about to call an escort. Unexpectedly, the aphrodisiac was so potent that Xu, who had taken too much, suddenly became poisoned, collapsed on the bed, and moaned incessantly. The tea servant noticed it and immediately reported it to the Laozha Police Station. Hua Tanmu Yang Guanying and Zhou Wenqing rushed to investigate. Xu only had exhalation and no inhalation, and he could not speak. The situation was very dangerous. He was immediately sent to Renji Hospital. He has not yet been out of danger, and his life may not be saved. Xu Huaifang only knew how to be wildly immoral, lingering in obscene places, and trampling on women. This result is also his reward for indulging in pleasure. However, it can also serve as a warning to other dissipated young people.

### Fictitious Transportation Company Defrauds Guarantee Money

One Criminal Forced to Take Poison, Fortunately Recovered Immediately, Transferred to Court, Sentenced to One and a Half Years Each

Pan Jilu from Hangzhou, Chen Zian from Guangdong, and a Mr. Wang recently opened Hongda Transportation Company at No. 404 Tianjin Road and widely recruited staff and workers. Each staff member had to pay a guarantee of one hundred yuan, and the workers had to pay half. At that time, twenty-five people, including Zhang Guohong and Zhu Jintao, went to register, paying more than 1,500 yuan. However, to date, the company has neither started business nor assigned positions to the individuals. Zhang and others knew that they had been deceived. So, yesterday they went to Chen Zian's home at No. 46 Longquanyuan Road, put Lian Baotu in pressure, and forced him to hand over the paid money. Chen could not cope, so he secretly swallowed opium ash in an attempt to commit suicide. His family summoned an ambulance to Renji Hospital for treatment. Hua Tan Gao Yong'an of the Laozha Police Station received the report, rushed to investigate, and found out all the details. He then arrested Pan Jilu, and Chen Zian was also saved from danger due to the quick treatment. Both were detained and yesterday transferred to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyers Zhang Shizhu and Jiang Baolian presented the details of the case and prosecuted them for the crime of obtaining property by fraud in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Law. After a detailed interrogation by Judge Fang Qinghuan, he declared a judgment in court, sentencing Pan Jilu and Chen Zian to one year and six months of imprisonment to serve as a warning.

### Chen Xiuzhen Abuses Adopted Daughter

Forcing Her Adopted Daughter to Do Evil, Shaving Her Head to Prevent Her Escape

The Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association received a report from righteous people on the 20th of this month, stating that Chen Xiuzhen, the concubine of a Mr. Liu, a bank manager residing at No. 16 Yimei Village, Xinzha Road, was abusing her adopted daughter, Sandi. The woman is a native of Nanjing, 27 years old,

From the Flower World

She is nicknamed Chongtian Pao, also known as Jiu Hua Niang. Please investigate, etc. The Child Welfare Association sent a clerk, Liu Jiaolin, along with police detectives, to inspect the address. When they arrived, the concubine was lying on a couch, smoking opium. A man was sitting next to her, said to be her boyfriend. In the opium tray, there were

Several Sex Toys

After the investigators interrogated the girl Sandi separately, they learned that the woman would force Sandi to do evil. When she refused, she would beat her and shave Sandi's head to prevent her from escaping. Sandi, with no way out, once swallowed the opium that the woman was smoking in desperation. Fortunately, it was discovered early and she was sent to the hospital. Fang Qing was reborn. According to Sandi, her adoptive mother would buy several adopted daughters and had already

Pawned Them to Brothels

or Escort Agencies. She hoped to escape the sea of suffering as soon as possible. During the investigation, police detectives took the opium lamp, opium pipe, and the criminals to be interrogated. It is now learned that the case was heard in the Ninth Court of the First Court of the Special District on the morning of the 26th. The judge rendered a judgment in court, ordering Chen Xiuzhen to abuse her adopted daughter and handing the girl Sandi over to the China Child Welfare Association for care. It is said that the defendant Chen Xiuzhen did not appear in court on that day. Fortunately, she was not found guilty of smoking opium.

### Chuan Xuelin Indiscriminately Issues Checks, Fined Thirty Yuan

Fu Xuelin, also known as Chuan Zhunian, a wealthy young businessman from Ningbo residing at No. 3 Zhifeng Lane, Huanlong Road, French Concession, is 21 years old this year. He is the divorced son-in-law of Xie Hengchuang, the Shanghai coal king. He recently opened the Ducheng Dance Hall and was accused of fraud and embezzlement. Just as that matter was coming to an end, he was sued in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court by his fellow villager Lu Huanzhi, who resides at Room 30, Tianxiang Building, Nanjing Road, for fraudulently issuing checks, requesting an investigation. The complaint states that on October 19th of last year, Chuan issued a National Currency check dated November 2nd from Shanghai Silk Industry Bank for one hundred yuan and delivered it to Xu Yitong. Xu presented the check to the plaintiff for redemption. However, when the plaintiff went to the bank to cash the check at the expiration date, it was dishonored and returned. He urged the issuer to deal with it, but he ignored him. The plaintiff then sued in court. This case has been concluded by Judge Wu Kechou. Yesterday, Chuan Xuelin was sentenced to a fine of thirty yuan for deliberately issuing a check with an amount exceeding the deposit when issuing the check. If he is to perform labor service, it is to be calculated at two yuan per day. The fraud portion of the remaining was deemed not guilty.

### Chang Chong, Fortune Teller, Sentenced to Three Years for Obtaining Property by Fraud

The Criminal Bowed His Head Silently When Hearing the Sentence, The Civil Suit Part Will Be Tried Separately

Hua Dawei from Wuxi, posing as a fortune teller and changing his name to Lin Musen, fabricated false statements and defrauded a young woman surnamed Xue of several thousand yuan in cash and ornaments. The case was discovered, and he was arrested and sent to the First Special District Local Court for trial. The details have been reported in previous editions. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo opened the court again and ordered the criminal to be brought in for further questioning. He confessed that he had been posing as a fortune teller for a year, but he had not deceived anyone other than the plaintiff. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that they were filing an ancillary civil suit against the criminal, requesting a judgment ordering him to repay the defrauded legal tender of 4,084 yuan, compensate for the defrauded British gold worth 1,344 yuan, US dollars worth 980 yuan, gold bracelets worth 300 yuan, diamond ring worth 100 yuan. Judge Dai, considering that the case had been investigated and clarified, instructed the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu and the defendant's defense lawyer to begin the final debate. He then announced the verdict, sentencing Lin Musen to three years of continuous fraud. Items such as yellow paper fortune-telling maps and Bagua plates were confiscated. The ancillary civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court for trial. The criminal bowed his head silently when hearing the sentence. The detectives escorted him back to detention, awaiting the determination of the judgment and being sent to the Western Prison for confinement. From now on, there will be one less rogue who uses Jianghu techniques as a tool to defraud property.

### Accidental Triggering of the Alarm, Suspected of Theft

A False Alarm at the Datong Pharmacy

The anti-theft alarm installed in the Datong Pharmacy at No. 851 Beijing Road, Public Concession, suddenly rang loudly at around twelve o'clock noon yesterday. The nearby patrolmen, suddenly hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene. At the same time, the police car of the police station also immediately drove to the scene. After investigation, there was no theft. It was then learned that it was due to the carelessness of the pharmacy's partner, who accidentally triggered the alarm, causing this false alarm.

### Extortion and Intimidation Case Continues Investigation

Zhu Zhongsheng, 25 years old from Chuansha, residing at No. 312 Ladu Road, French Concession, organized an extortion and intimidation agency with a group of people at the Dalai Hotel, Remi Road, in August of last year. First, he intimidated Huang Peng, an iron merchant residing at No. 10, Henglifang, Henry Road, and extorted 5,000 yuan as a result of a negotiated settlement at the Weida Hotel (including a thousand yuan in public bonds). Later, he continuously sent letters to Wang Jisheng, who resides at No. 358 Fulvli Road, intimidating him for 50,000 yuan, which was unsuccessful. The letters included three bullets. The case was discovered by the French police, who arrested Zhu Zhongsheng, Zhou Junmei from Taicang who wrote the threatening letters, and accomplices Bao Chongzheng, Zhang Amao, Zhang Luozong, Zhang Fengxiang, Zhang Guojun, etc. They also searched the Dalai Hotel and found guerrilla letterhead, envelopes, seals, symbols, and drafts of threatening letters. They were sent to the Second Special Court, requesting detention for investigation and adjournment for further questioning. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the presiding judge came to the First Criminal Court for further hearing. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer representing the French Concession administrative authorities, stated that because the case was complex and significant, the police department had not yet completed the investigation and requested a further adjournment for trial. After verifying the facts in court, the defendant was not interrogated, and the hearing was adjourned to the 31st of this month. The defendants remain in custody.

### American Art and Calligraphy Association Donates Funds to Refugee Education Institute

All Proceeds from Tickets Donated to the Institute, Broadcasting Reports on the Backgrounds of Refugee Children

The Refugee Children's Education and Care Institute, in order to raise funds for the construction of a dyeing institute building, is holding a broadcast promotion event. Today, on the anniversary of the January 28th Incident, the institute is reporting on the backgrounds of refugee children all day at the Dalai Radio Station, urging families to pay attention.

It has been open to the public on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company since the 25th. Each item is priced at five yuan. Originally, the ticket sales were intended to be used to relieve refugee children. Yesterday, the institute specially sent Secretary Yu Jingqing to the association to contact the host Xie Haiyan. Mr. Xie, concerned about the disaster-stricken children, agreed to donate all the income to the institute's construction fund. It is estimated that the exhibition will close on the 31st, and the proceeds could reach 2,000 yuan.

### Hand Grenades Found in Garbage Can

The patrol team of the Putuo Road Police Station, at around seven o'clock yesterday evening, while patrolling the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and the border, discovered six hand grenades and ten bullets in a garbage can on an unnamed small street in that area. The intention of hiding them in the can seems to be that they were hidden by bandits. They immediately surveyed the vicinity but found no other traces. They then reported the information to the police station, who took the grenades and investigated the clues.

### Silk Broker Defrauds Fellow Merchant of Silk

Pledging More Than a Thousand Yuan to Gambling Dens, Detained and Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment

Zheng Fuyuan from Ningbo has been operating as a silk broker. His business contact point is Room 41 of the Yuanyuan Hotel, No. 520 Jiujiang Road. On the 10th of the month, a fellow villager, Ji Lianfang, who is also a silk broker, went to Zheng's place and said that Shuilun Silk Shop at No. 23 Beijing Road wanted to buy 180 bolts of silk and asked him to deliver 100 bolts first on the 21st and another 80 bolts on the 22nd. The price was set at 2,260 yuan, and the payment would be made within two days after delivery. Zheng knew that Yonglun Silk Shop had a good reputation in the industry and that Ji was also in the same industry. So, he delivered the goods as agreed. When the goods were delivered, Ji was waiting outside the door and did not instruct them to be sent to Yonglun Shop. Afterwards, when Zheng went to Yonglun to collect the payment, he learned that Yonglun had not actually commissioned Ji to order the goods. Ji had designed to defraud him of the goods. He then reported it to the Laozha Police Station, and Hua Tan Chen Ruisheng arrested Ji the day before yesterday. It was found that after Ji had defrauded the goods, he immediately pledged them to Qingyuan, Shuntai, Tongsheng and other pawnshops, obtaining 1,616 yuan. However, this money had been spent by Ji at the Hollywood gambling den in a few days. Yesterday, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyers Zhang Shizhu and Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for the crime of fraud in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Law. After Judge Fang Qinghuan interrogated him, he sentenced Ji Lianfang to one year imprisonment to serve as a warning.

### Eve of the "January 28th" Incident, Activities of Guerrilla Troops in the Suburbs

Conflict Occurs in Hongqiao Area, Japanese and Puppet Troops Suffer Casualties in Northern Shanghai

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post," the National Salvation Army, which is conducting semi-guerrilla warfare around Shanghai, has doubled its activities as the seventh anniversary of Shanghai's initial "unwarranted war" approaches. A commando unit of the army launched a surprise attack on the Japanese garrison in the Hongqiao area of western Shanghai last night (the 26th). A fierce battle took place from 10 p.m., lasting two hours. The outcome of the conflict is not yet certain. According to another source, one Japanese soldier and two puppet police officers were killed in the battle.

Pudong: At 3:00 a.m. on the 26th, an encounter battle between Chinese and Japanese troops occurred in the southwest head of Beicai Town, Pudong. According to the investigation, the location of the battle was in the Dongsanlintang area under the jurisdiction of Shanghai County. First, a team from the puppet "army" Xu Hongfa's unit, under pressure from the Japanese army, was responsible for patrolling the Shangnan Railway. The Chinese army guerrilla unit, Fan's unit, detected the actions of the puppet "army" and launched a counterattack, killing three puppet "soldiers" on the spot and capturing six or seven others. The rest fled back and reported to the Japanese army, who sent a large force to assist. The Chinese army also knew that the puppet army would bring the Japanese army to retaliate after they left, so they also rushed to mobilize a large force to assist. A fierce battle broke out with the Japanese army in the dark of night, lasting from 4:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., lasting for five hours. Fearing that the Chinese army would take more violent actions, the Japanese side strengthened its defenses in various places yesterday and forced the puppet "army" and puppet "police" to go to Shangnan and Shangchuan Roads to threaten the villagers along the railway to pay attention to the whereabouts of the guerrillas and set harsh measures without reason. Where a section of track is destroyed by the guerrillas, the houses on both sides of the road, regardless of whether they are inhabited by our guerrillas, will be burned down to entrust civilians with the responsibility of investigating the guerrillas. This is indeed a novel move by the Japanese and puppet forces. Although the situation in the coastal Japanese navy警戒 area has eased, several armored vehicles patrolled the Pudong Avenue and lively streets yesterday morning as a show of force. Armed soldiers riding motorcycles patrolling between Xinzhu Road and Pudong Avenue were particularly busy.

Songjiang: According to sources who arrived in Shanghai from Jiashan, the guerrilla forces on the western shore of Taihu Lake have gradually advanced eastward to the Liantang area in the western suburbs of Songjiang. The Japanese army launched an attack on Liantang from Songjiang, Fengjing, Jiashan, and Qingpu on the morning of the 22nd of this month. The guerrilla forces immediately met them head-on, and the two sides fought fiercely for a night. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 100 casualties and sank three Japanese steamships. The guerrilla forces also suffered considerable losses. Afterwards, the Japanese army conducted a major search in the town.

Spring and Autumn

### Holy Fire

— Naiyi

History is the cruelest thing, it mercilessly discards dregs and marches ahead with its head held high.

The flames of the War of Resistance are an even more refined alchemic fire, exposing the true forms of millennia-old foxes, who are then forced to stir up ghostly winds and enter the "sea."

The giant wheel of the times advances rapidly in this blazing situation, causing ghosts and monsters to hide and demons to disappear.

The hiding and disappearing of demons and monsters does not naturally mean their annihilation. Some are more skilled, some less, and the timing of their exposure varies. However, their fear and loathing of the holy fire of the War of Resistance are consistent, hence the so-called "peace talk."

Speaking of "peace talk," the "New Shenbao" has been spreading it quite vigorously these days. Not only did it use an "editorial" to respond to Wang Jingwei's telegram, but it also continuously "manufactured" news, publishing it in large characters on the front page.

For example, the newspaper on the 26th stated, "Wang Jingwei recently sent a telegram of several thousand words to the Fifth Plenary Session"; the newspaper on the 27th was about Wu Peifu, saying, "If realized, the overall trend of peace and truce in China can be decided."

From this, one can see the anxious expression of those tormented in the holy fire of the War of Resistance. However, this is just wishful thinking. Wang Jingwei's telegram to the Fifth Plenary Session is a mystery, but the newspaper claimed with great certainty that it was "several thousand words long," revealing the subtle relationship to what extent; as for Wu Peifu, the Tongmeng News Agency praised him highly in its telegram, but according to their own account, he was also "seeing the trend of the overall situation and unwilling to easily express his attitude, still studying the classics as before." "Peace" remains an empty dream made while holding one's nose.

On the other hand, our Fifth Plenary Session has concluded. According to the special telegrams from various evening newspapers on the 27th, it can be summarized into two points: (1) All vowed to resist to the end under the leadership of the highest leader, never compromising (Chairman Chiang's opening speech at the Fifth Plenary Session provided a detailed explanation); (2) Resulting from this decision, strengthen the national defense military structure.

The contrast is clear. The ghosts and monsters' twittering "peace talk" will only be a dirge sung while being tormented by the holy fire of the War of Resistance.

As for "January 28th," it was the day that sowed the seeds of the holy fire of the War of Resistance, proving from that date onwards the ghosts and monsters' fear and apprehension of the holy fire.

### The Shanghai Art School Students' Relief Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition Returns

— (Guo Hongye)

China is undergoing a great disaster, and the 450 million descendants of the Yellow Emperor are bravely fighting for national revival. Although the devil's clutches are cruel, destroying fields, ruins, and huts everywhere, committing rape, arson, and murder with extreme cruelty, it has strengthened the indomitable spirit of the entire Chinese nation! On this isolated island, we can see countless refugees who cannot return to their sweet homes of the past, preferring to freeze and starve to death rather than submit to the enemy, living their most desolate lives of displacement. Therefore, on the streets and in the harbors, we see many emaciated, unclothed, and unfed refugees struggling in the cold north wind. Who wouldn't feel heartache at these tragic scenes of exile!

To help relieve the refugees, the entire faculty and students of the Shanghai Art School launched a large-scale painting and calligraphy exhibition, held on the fourth floor of the Great Sun Company on Nanjing Road. When I stepped inside, the large oil paintings in the first room immediately attracted me. The four paintings hanging on both sides were a collaboration by senior students of the Shanghai Art School, titled "Flight," "Longing," "Displacement," and "Death." They used strong lines and somber tones to depict the inner pain of the refugees, which is precisely a true reflection of the crimes of the brutal enemy! Two paintings hung on the front: one by Guan Liang and the largest one by Liu Shi. In the center of that large painting, a pair of plump male and female figures were depicted standing with their backs turned. The woman was half-naked, holding a child in her arms, and the man was pointing forward with his right hand. I looked at the title and exclaimed, "Light is Ahead"! Yes, this is the eve of the dawn for the Chinese nation. But we should not quietly wait for the light; we should fight! We must break through the demonic darkness and fight for the light of tomorrow. And the artists' grasp of this kind of subject matter is worthy of our admiration!

The second and fourth rooms displayed Chinese paintings and calligraphy. Flowers accounted for almost 90% of the Chinese paintings, and there were only a few landscapes, mostly written in a free and unrestrained style, forming lively and bold brushstrokes. Liu Haisu, Wang Yiting, Wu Fuzhi, Yu Gongyu, Wang Jiyuan, Zai Shengyuan, Xu Xi, Zhang Tianqi and others all had excellent works. The third room also displayed oil paintings, but there were mostly beautiful landscape paintings, brightly colored still life paintings, and life drawings of models with beautiful curves, as well as a few postwar ruins on the walls. The fifth room displayed pattern paintings, half of which were decorative paintings and half of which were craft design patterns, with a small number. The composition of the paintings seemed too ordinary.

After leaving the venue, I was very impressed with the spirit of the faculty and students of the Shanghai Art School. At the same time, I hope that other art schools on this isolated island can also rise up to speak for the refugees.

### Talking About "Extra Income"

— Xinliang

"Hey, old buddy, how's the gravy lately?"

"Oh! Where do I even begin? I've really caught a 'blood' deficiency these days!"

In Shanghai, you'll easily hear these two typical lines. The so-called "gravy" and "blood" are both Shanghai people's terms for "extra income."

Speaking of extra income, newcomers to Shanghai will surely think it means "especially faster." When I first came to Shanghai, I didn't know that it was a monetary term. It wasn't until later that I realized that in Shanghai, in addition to the so-called "monthly salary," "wage," "travel expenses," "entertainment expenses," and so on, there was also something called "extra income."

Some Shanghai people simply live entirely on this "extra income." What they earn each month, the "official salary" that they see, is so meager that supporting a family of three or four is indeed not easy. Therefore, in Shanghai, when looking for a job or asking someone to help introduce a position, people generally prefer the "official salary" to be smaller, it doesn't matter, but they are very concerned about whether there is "extra income" and how much it is. When you ask some people, "How much money can you make each month?", they often answer, "It's really not enough to cover expenses! Managing thirty or forty yuan a month, in this era of expensive rice and everything costing as much as gold, is just barely enough to get by." However, in secret, do you know that there is an invisible "extra income" supplementing them? Some people will frankly tell you: "If there is only a fixed hard salary and no extra income, you will surely starve to death on Shanghai soil."

The words "extra income" are so deeply imprinted in the minds of ordinary Shanghai people that they seem to be of equal importance to "salary," or even more so. The "small accounts" in cheap restaurants, the commission in foreign firms, the "tip money" for delivery people, etc., are all "extra income" in the minds of Shanghai people. Especially in entertainment venues such as dance halls and game halls, "extra income" can be said to be the most abundant. The "security guards," "tea waiters," "porters," and "waiters," if they had to rely solely on their "official salary," it would indeed be impossible to make ends meet. And the reason why they are happy to do this kind of work is precisely because of the abundant "extra income."

On the other hand, "extra income" is also sinful. Because they want to get extra income, some people will exhaust all their efforts and use all kinds of cunning words and means, or abandon the dignity of their position, to win people's pleasure and favor. As a result, the mentality of greed, and despicable and inferior behavior, arise under these circumstances. Sometimes, after you finish a meal at a restaurant, if you don't give the waiter some extra tip, or "extra income," they will feel unhappy, pout their mouths, and turn their faces blue, making you feel uncomfortable.

In fact, why should our lives depend on "extra income," on other people's charity? Can we willingly do without "extra income"? "Extra income" cannot be made public, it is sinful. I think it would be better for employers to give their employees a little extra "salary" and abolish this "extra income" system.

According to the meaning of the term "extra income," it seems that the characters "extra funds" should be used, meaning additional income. However, the common pronunciation "extra income" is still used for convenience. It is noted here for future discussion. – Editor

### Five Phoenixes Sing Together

— Li Zhihua

"Five of a Kind"

Produced by 20th Century Fox, Playing at the Grand Light Cinema

A set of quintuplet girls is good "news": thanks to advances in science, these "five packages" have all survived without injury. From a medical point of view, this is also a victory. But what about filmmakers filming it and releasing it to the world?

I remember that many products used the Dionne quintuplets as brand names. For example, cookies were painted on the tin box with images of all five of them. There has also been a movie called "Five Lucky Stars."

These are smart moves, for their "business sense," right?

Now these quintuplet girls are gradually growing up. They can sing inarticulate songs and pour tea and dance.

Filmmakers are probably still smart. Of course, they won't let go of this "business sense," so they made this "Five Phoenixes Sing Together."

I don't object to filming the lives of the Dionne quintuplets as a newsreel. But it's superfluous to add a little beginning and end, interspersed to become a story, to become a "feature film."

Let's talk about this "Five Phoenixes Sing Together." The "story" that goes with it is about a male and a female news reporter who have a little unpleasantness due to competition, and they try to tease each other. Later, the female reporter, entrusted by the New York Foundling Home, wanted to invite the Dionne quintuplets to perform in New York and had already agreed. But by chance, she was tricked and broadcast an inaccurate news report. Dr. Luke heard about this and thought that Ge (the female reporter) had ulterior motives, so he did not allow the five girls to go to New York to perform. Duke (the male reporter) learned about this and felt deeply regretful and uneasy, and decided to help complete the matter to atone for his previous fault. So, after his efforts, the truth came out, and the five girls "broadcasted the situation of the five girls celebrating their fourth birthday" on the wireless television machine. "Ge deeply appreciated Luke's help, and dispelled all previous misunderstandings, and became good friends."

From a meaningful point of view, this kind of story can't be considered bad, but in terms of dramatic nature, it is really too bland. The motivation for filming is to introduce the lives of the Dionne quintuplets, and the story becomes an accessory, so it is no wonder.

The story is an appendage to the Dionne sisters, and the other characters are even more appendages to the appendages. So, there is no need to talk about their acting.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Two: Master Engineer Lin Ingeniously Explains Standardization; Guide Jin Eloquently Discusses Equality

Zaijing laughed and said, "I know that Sister Paiyun has always been fond of me; she definitely wouldn't speak ill of me. What dishes are you even eating? Stop with the grand theories, and order the food quickly!" She then handed the menu on the table to Jin Danyu. It turned out that within this Ling Village restaurant, besides the cooperative's cafeteria, which had a fixed menu daily, there was also a separate menu for small eats. This menu listed over a dozen dishes, from which one could choose a few. As for ordering anything particularly special, they would politely decline. At this moment, Jin Danyu took the menu in hand, pondered for a moment, and then said to Lin Jiancheng, "I think these dishes are ones that both sisters would also eat. Coming here to eat is just about having some fresh vegetables. I think we should ask Little Jing to have the kitchen here prepare four or five dishes, and we'll just eat those. Ordering too much would be wasteful; we are practical people." Lin Jiancheng nodded and said, "Yes! Both Miss Hes are probably tired of eating the same dishes these past few days, so coming here is to taste the rural flavors. I think we can give them a sum and ask them to prepare dishes for three yuan." Zaijing laughed and said, "Preparing four or five dishes won't even cost three yuan; at most, two yuan is enough. There are no extravagant items here, but the cooking is still palatable." As she spoke, Zaijing went off on her own. This was because the vegetables at this Ling Village restaurant were famous. It was located close to the rural area, and they had organized a production and sales cooperative. Whenever there were fresh vegetables, they would be gathered and sent here. Every morning, the kitchen had a designer who would see what fresh ingredients were available and then decide what dishes to prepare. Besides the cooperative's cafeteria, they also prepared a menu for the needs of tourists. Today, Miss Jin was actually able to treat guests for just two yuan. But if you went back a few years, it was even more economical than now. Don't even mention being able to treat guests for two yuan; one yuan could cover the expenses for four people, including oneself! After a short while, Zaijing brought up the dishes one by one, along with a large pot of rice. Indeed, the dishes were all fresh and delicious. Many restaurants often prioritized meat, with vegetables as a side dish, but here, it was the opposite—vegetables were the main focus, with meat as a supplement. The two Miss He sisters ate and praised them endlessly. Both of them didn't usually eat much, but at this moment, they ate heartily, truly enjoying a fragrant and satisfying meal. However, for refills of rice and such, they had to help themselves; Wang Jing no longer came to serve. Because Miss Jin and the others arrived early, there was no one in this back room, but now, people were arriving in succession, and Zaijing had to go serve others. Truly:

Fragrant dishes and full bellies in peaceful times, frugal men and active women in ancient style. (24)

### The "January 28th Incident" as a Dividing Line for Drama and Film

— Dai

The "January 28th Incident" seems superficially unrelated to drama and film, but in fact, it marked a clear dividing line for Chinese drama and film. Anyone who enjoys drama and film can see this by simply comparing drama and film before and after the "January 28th Incident."

First, looking at drama, the gunfire of the "January 28th Incident" awakened all Chinese playwrights. Their pace became uniform, their front lines aligned, and the style of their scripts changed abruptly. Scripts that focused on romance and romanticism disappeared. From national drama to national defense drama, playwrights used powerful writing to awaken national consciousness. As a result, many scripts with national defense themes were constantly performed on stage, directly or indirectly awakening many numb people through these dramas.

Film and drama are certainly related, because filmmaking requires a story, which is a film script. The change in style of playwrights forced filmmakers to follow suit. At the same time, spurred on by playwrights and encouraged by film critics, film also embarked on the path of national defense, and national defense films rose to prominence! After the "January 28th Incident," the style of general film companies also changed. The scripts they chose were mostly conscious and had national defense themes. In the most recent five or six years, we have indeed seen many films that were sufficient for national salvation.

It can be seen that the "January 28th Incident" prompted the awakening of Chinese playwrights, film playwrights, and composers, who all took on the responsibility of national salvation, using drama and film to awaken the public. As a result, drama and film clearly marked a new era. Not only drama and film, but also other forms of entertainment were affected to some extent. After the "January 28th Incident," they changed somewhat, moving towards a more correct path, directly or indirectly awakening the audience's awareness.

### Top Ten Highest-Grossing Stars of the Past Year

— Hua Quansheng

The American magazine *Motion Picture Herald* publishes an annual list at the end of each year, based on the box office records of various films in various theaters, of the top ten stars with the best box office performance. — For example, in 1937, the first place was child star Shirley Temple. — Hollywood stars pay close attention to this list because it allows them to see how their acting skills are, whether they can attract audiences, and whether they can win the love of fans!

The top ten stars with the best box office performance in 1938 were announced in the magazine published on December 24th of last year:

First place — still child star Shirley Temple.

Second place — Clark Gable.

Third place — Sonja Henie.

Fourth place — Mickey Rooney.

Fifth place — Spencer Tracy.

Sixth place — Robert Taylor.

Seventh place — Myrna Loy.

Eighth place — Kim Hunter.

Ninth place — Alice Faye.

Tenth place — Tyrone Power.

Among them, Shirley Temple's consecutive wins for three years (1936, 37, 38) are the most remarkable. And Alice Faye in ninth place was just a supporting actress the year before last. After starring in the two mega-hits "In Old Chicago" and "Alexander's Ragtime Band," she leaped to stardom. Now, she has been selected as one of the "Top Ten Stars," which is truly something to be proud of.

In addition, the box office performance of more than ten other stars was also very impressive, so an additional "Honorary Mention Award" was given to fifteen people:

(2) Gary Cooper, (2) Wallace Beery, (3) Bing Crosby, (4) Jeanette MacDonald, (5) Deanna Durbin, (6) Don Ameche, (7) Dorothy Lamour, (8) Ginger Rogers, (9) Nelson Eddy, (10) Bob Burns, (11) Errol Flynn, (12) Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, (13) Irene Dunne, (14) Paul Muni, (15) Tyrone Power.

The reason why MacDonald and Eddy occupy three places is because the two sometimes worked together and sometimes separately (for example, MacDonald's "Firefly" and Eddy's "Rosalie" resulted in different films and separate records!).

### Behind the Scenes of Amateur Actors' Charity Performance

— Xitong

Amateur actors performed a charity performance at the Golden Grand Theater on the 25th night to raise money for refugees. When I arrived, "Judging the Head and Stabbing the Soup" had just begun. Ms. Sun Zhang Zhuqing, playing Lu Bing, showed anxiety when the case couldn't be closed. Her expressions and tone were good. Ms. Xu Yunhui, playing Yun Yan, was ordered by Lord Lu to have servants place four heads on the ground for her to identify her husband's head. Afraid of making a mistake, she pointed at the heads with her left hand, trembling, with a look of panic and urgency on her face. Her right sleeve rose up, and the posture was very beautiful. Later, she found her husband's head and cried bitterly, and the performance was also very sincere. The long lyrics at the beginning of the stabbing scene were very clear and pleasant to listen to. It is said that it was her first time acting in this play, so it is not easy to achieve this.

When "Four Plates Mountain" came on stage, a sign was hung next to the stage, with the titles of five or six enthusiastic and charitable gentlemen written on it. They were all giving the money to Miss Shang Huizhen, "Flower Basket Converted to Cash" to be donated to refugees. This can be said to be a successor to Jin Suqin. We hope that this trend can spread. Shang Huizhen is very young, about fourteen or fifteen years old. Her makeup is very good. She doesn't have much stage experience, so she is a bit stage-frightened. Her singing is very low, and she has few expressions. It is said that her little tongue stuck out twice. Ms. Qiu Ruiying's Siyi was played very enthusiastically, with a loud voice. Her stage steps were natural, completely devoid of a woman's gait. Her qin player shook his head frequently when he reached the climax, as if reading ancient texts, which also aroused the audience's appreciation.

The final highlight was "Four Performances of Chasing Gui Xin," with four different Han Xins and four different Xiao Hes. The lights were very busy, sometimes bright and sometimes dark, and Xiao He and Han Xin were like revolving lanterns, running in and out, busy endlessly. Zhang Zhongyuan, the son-in-law of Zhou Xinfang, naturally best captures the essence of the Qipai style and is also the most energetic. One spectator, seeing Zhang Zhongyuan grab his sleeves deftly and glare his eyes, couldn't help but stand up and exclaim, "Just like Qilin Tong!"

### Introducing "A History of Chinese Drama"

— Huis

Written by Xu Muyun, published by Shiju Bookstore

In recent years, many books on the study of drama have been published, explaining the plot and lyrics. This helps viewers a lot, and also allows southerners to gradually avoid the criticism of "being able to watch a play but not understand it." However, Chinese drama has a long history, and brief introductions are ultimately insufficient. Moreover, Chinese drama is known for its expressiveness. Its posture, singing, costumes, and stage settings are all symbolic. Without experience in this field, it is difficult to understand them. Even the most subtle combinations contain geographical colors and historical evolution. Drama is loved by everyone, but it is not everyone's ability to get guidance from veteran actors. Therefore, one can only rely on engaging books. In the past, the Englishman Arlington wrote "Chinese Drama", and Ms. Cheng Xiuling wrote "The Secrets of Chinese Drama", which were convenient for Westerners watching Chinese drama. Often, when going to the theater with Chinese friends, they can speak authoritatively, making Chinese friends feel uneasy. However, these books are actually very simple and basic, and definitely cannot be compared with Mr. Xu Muyun's new book, "A History of Chinese Drama." "A History of Chinese Drama" is divided into five categories: (1) The history of Chinese drama, which traces the evolution of ancient and modern times from a vertical perspective; (2) The types of Chinese drama, which lists in detail the various genres of opera in various regions, such as Qinqiang, Kunqu, Gaoyue, Hanyue, Chuan opera, Cantonese opera, Bangzi opera, and Peking opera; (3) The organization of Chinese drama, which describes the origins of roles, stage settings, backstage, and costumes; (4) The function of facial makeup and costumes, which adds color illustrations and detailed explanations for loyalty, treachery, goodness, evil, civilization, martial arts, honor, and inferiority; (5) Artistic research, which provides insightful commentary on singing, recitation, rhythm, and the archetypes of famous actors. With this article, one can not only increase one's appreciation for Peking opera and various local dramas, but also understand why Chinese drama has been popularized throughout the country and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people for three thousand years, and consider how to reorganize and develop it, in order to supplement social education.

Dance World Movie Viewing

### (7) Special Dance Halls

The dance halls in Shanghai were originally established by Westerners. The decorations and facilities were extremely luxurious, and the orchestra was also excellent. At that time, the most famous ones were Dahua on Gordon Road and Carlton on the Racecourse. However, the dance halls lacked female dance partners. Therefore, not as many Chinese people frequented them as Westerners did. The original Bai Le Dou also did not have female dance partners. Later, dance halls with female dance partners emerged one after another, like bamboo shoots after a rain. As a result, the noble dance halls that relied solely on tea fees had to abandon their gentlemanly policies. Bai Le Dou once had male dance partners, but before women's economic independence, this approach seemed difficult to implement. Everything should be classified as common if it is widespread and special if it is in the minority. Therefore, this article calls the dance halls with the original setup (that is, those without female dance partners) special dance halls.

The Arcadia is located on Pushi Road in the French Concession. The entrance is not grand, but there are many twists and turns inside. There are several large and small rest rooms, which are beautifully decorated and very suitable for waiting for guests or having secret conversations with partners. The dance floor is not very large, but the seats are quite comfortable. Behind the pool is a stage. Each dance performance lasts three to four minutes, and every one or two performances, a performance or singing is added. The costumes and scenery of the performance are quite impressive, and the dance skills are also quite beautiful. However, one can only hear humming sounds in the singing and cannot appreciate the beauty of it. There are more than a dozen song and dance programs every night, which are changed once a week. Westerners outnumber Chinese people among the customers, and dance partners and people from Beili still make up more than half of the Chinese people. Very few people bring their wives and concubines to enjoy themselves. As the saying goes, home flowers are not as fragrant as wild flowers, which truly speaks to the common psychology of people. However, if wild flowers are transplanted into the garden, not only will the natural charm be completely lost, but also the wild nature will be difficult to tame, and the consequences will be unimaginable. Since habits are formed, it is not something that can be changed suddenly. Although I have not personally experienced it, I have seen very few friends who have achieved good results. I am writing this as an extra word of advice to my fellow enthusiasts: one should treat leisure entertainment as a fleeting cloud. (8)

The editor met Mr. Mai Youyun, a celebrity in the chess world, yesterday. According to him, Mr. Huang Songxuan, the chess king of Guangdong and other nine provinces, has passed away in Xiamen. Mr. Huang was an outstanding talent in South China. His chess skills were superb and he was respected by people in eastern Guangdong. When the editor traveled south the year before last, he met Mr. Huang at Tiannan Teahouse in Guangzhou and planned to launch a national masters competition in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, it did not materialize, and now he has passed away suddenly, which is truly regrettable!

### Secret History of the Forbidden City and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (88)

— Xu Muyun

Li Da Wu was a famous bad mouth

Who knew that the next day he would sing "Xiaoyao Jin"; it could be considered a signature play of the Kui school. However, Shuangchu, because he wanted to redeem his face from yesterday, worked extra hard, which led to overexertion. When singing a dozen "Deceiving Us," the sound was too abrupt, and they were all the same. The third day, this Master Li changed to another "Holoju", with a person bent over, holding a square copper plate in his hand, looking like a construction worker smashing the ground. As soon as he saw Shuangchu entering, he said to the crowd: "Today, my 'pendant' is changed. Look, this is called 'Dianhu'." After this, Shuangchu really couldn't stay in Beijing, so he resigned and went south. Later, he became blind and over eighty years old, and he still had to perform in the Dajing class in Shanghai's New World, earning only two or three hundred yuan a month, all of which was used to support his son's opium habit (his son played the qin for him). At that time, when we heard the old man's magnificent voice, we were really invigorated, but when we heard his "Xiaoyao Jin" scolding Yang Guang, the kind of grief was often enough to make people shed tears. It is said that when he was dying, he lay in bed and recited all the plays he knew in his life, and then passed away suddenly. In terms of his qualifications and voice, he was on par with Sun Juxian, but the two people's situations were very different. In retrospect, this had something to do with Da Li Wu's two Holoju. If he hadn't been protecting Beijing at the time, he would have been able to fill Lao Sun's vacancy after the Gengzi Incident and receive special rewards from the Empress Dowager. Why would he have died poor in Shanghai? So Li Tingshun was also a bit immoral.

Mei Rongquan was an old partner of the lame Liu Hongsheng, and his voice for singing "Hua Lian" was also quite good. One day, he sang "Duan Mi Jian" with Da Li Wu. Mei went to Li Mi, and Li went to Wang Bodang. The two had to sing fast, without any room for thought. Who knew that when Da Li Wu sang, "Speaking of a one-character prince, Bodang looks ordinary, Princess Heyang, you set a trap, you are a human-faced beast-hearted person!" He deliberately divided the four sentences into two parts, stopping abruptly after only singing the second sentence. According to the rules of the duet fast singing, as long as he left the opportunity for the other person to take over, the other person had to quickly continue singing. However, because Li Wu was being malicious, he did not announce Li Mi's crimes and scold him in the third and fourth sentences. How could Li Mi, as he said above, have been able to pick up with "A virtuous brother should not speak, evil words hurt me."
