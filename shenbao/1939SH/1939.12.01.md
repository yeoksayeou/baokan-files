London (From Helsinki) After Soviet troops invaded Finnish territory this morning, heavy fighting has occurred in several locations. Shortly after Moscow announced to the world the severing of diplomatic relations with Finland, the powerful Soviet war machine, including infantry, aircraft, and heavy artillery, began operations. The initial point of Soviet incursion into Finland was in several locations in the Karelian Isthmus. Subsequently, Soviet aircraft appeared over Helsinki. As of this evening, the Soviet side has (1) bombarded the Vammelsuu area of the Karelian Isthmus from the sea (primarily from Kronstadt), (2) exchanged artillery fire with Finland in the Kiviniemi area, (3) occupied a small corner of Suojärvi, (4) dropped incendiary bombs on the Malmi airfield near Helsinki and the eastern part of Vyborg, causing several fires, (5) attacked Helsinki by air, causing minor damage, (6) occupied the Finnish part of the northernmost Ribachi Peninsula on the Soviet-Finnish border, and (7) bombarded the Triigioki area near the Soviet border. According to the Finnish Ministry of Defence, as of now, two Soviet aircraft have been shot down, one near Helsinki. It is also reported that Soviet forces are preparing to land on the island of Seiskari in the Gulf of Finland.

(Havas, 29th)

### Secretary of State Hull States: The United States is Willing to Mediate, Only Hoping for a Peaceful Resolution to the Soviet-Finnish Dispute, Clarifying that it Has No Intention of Arbitrating

Washington According to reports from Stockholm, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, suddenly cancelled his scheduled hunting trip and flew from Stockholm to Riga, and will travel by train from Riga directly to Moscow. This has attracted great attention, and it is widely believed that the U.S. Ambassador will attempt to mediate the Soviet-Finnish dispute, but most observers say that the Soviet government will reject U.S. mediation. (United Press, 30th)

Washington Secretary of State Hull issued a statement to the newspapers, declaring that the United States is willing to mediate the dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union. This was decided by Hull on a long-distance telephone call, following the advice of President Roosevelt. According to diplomatic sources, the United States regards this as an unavoidable duty and a matter of utmost urgency, and therefore issued it in the form of a statement, hoping to arouse world public opinion and eliminate the Soviet-Finnish war before it occurs. Previously, when relations between Germany and Poland were tense, President Roosevelt appealed to the heads of state of those countries in a personal capacity. Because the President is currently resting in Hot Springs, Secretary of State Hull made this move. Since 1938, whenever a crisis has occurred in Europe, the U.S. government has asked the authorities of the countries involved to choose one of three methods: reconciliation, mediation, or arbitration. However, this mediation is considered the beginning. However, Secretary of State Hull made some reservations in his statement, namely:

Declaring that the U.S. government only hopes that the dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union can be resolved peacefully, and is not acting as an arbitrator. As to why he used a statement instead of directly making a proposal to the countries involved, it was to avoid attacks from isolationists. At the same time, because U.S. public opinion is extremely indignant towards the Soviet Union, it should be taken into account. If one of the two countries, Finland or the Soviet Union, refuses U.S. mediation, then who is the aggressor is self-evident. (Havas, 29th)

London The British Foreign Office issued a communiqué stating that the British government welcomes the news that the U.S. government intends to mediate the Soviet-Finnish dispute, and believes that this type of dispute does not warrant any party involved adopting a war plan. The British government sincerely hopes that this proposal will be accepted by both parties. (Reuters, 30th)

Washington President Roosevelt returned here from Hot Springs today and consulted with Secretary of State Hull on the Soviet-Finnish situation. At the same time, he learned that an official from the Soviet Embassy had advised the U.S. government that it might not be necessary for the U.S. to mediate the Soviet-Finnish dispute in order to achieve a peaceful resolution. On the Finnish side, the Finnish envoy to the United States has notified the U.S. government that Finland welcomes U.S. mediation. (Reuters, 30th)

London Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today regarding the Soviet invasion of Finland that the British government is deeply saddened by this newly occurring attack on a small, independent country, as the result of this action will cause innocent people to suffer misfortune and loss of life. The British government welcomes the willingness of U.S. Secretary of State Hull to mediate. The British government believes that the issue in dispute between the Soviet Union and Finland is not of a nature to resort to war. (London, 30th)

### Germany Has No Intention of Serving as a Mediator

Berlin Political figures here are taking a calm attitude towards the tense situation between the Soviet Union and Finland. It is solemnly stated here that Germany does not intend to become involved in the Soviet-Finnish conflict, nor does it intend to serve as a mediator. The newspapers here only carry news from Moscow and Helsinki and do not offer any comments. Political figures believe that the Soviet government's desire is to escape the constraints of the post-World War I era and restore control over the Gulf of Finland and the eastern Baltic Sea. It is claimed that this is the Soviet Union's only demand and that it has no intention of ruling Finland. (Hapdong News Agency, 30th)

### Finland Responds to Soviet Note, Suggesting Arbitration Methods

Helsinki The Finnish government has responded to the note from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov notifying them of the termination of the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Pact, denying that Finland has committed any border incursions. It stated that Finland only has border guard units stationed near the border, which are not a threat to Leningrad. There is no reason for the Soviet Union to terminate this pact. The pact should be valid until 1945. According to its provisions, difficulties between the two countries must be resolved peacefully through a conciliation committee. The Finnish government further suggested a method of arbitration by neutral countries. (Reuters, 30th)

### Finnish President Declares War

Oslo The public radio station here has issued a message stating that after the Soviet troops invaded Finland, Finnish President Kallio has declared a state of war and appointed General Mannerheim as Commander-in-Chief of the Army. (Havas, 30th)

Editorial

### The Principles of International Fairness and Arbitration

Why is international unrest so severe today? China and Japan are at war, and England, France, and Germany are already at war. The killing can be described as cruel, and the impact can be described as tragic. The trend indicates that anyone can feel that crises are lurking and could erupt at any moment. The universality and depth of future disasters may far exceed the wars of these few countries. Following this evolution, who knows where it will end? Perhaps, in the end, no country, no race, no ordinary man or woman will be an exception, and the earth will become a huge furnace for a final reckoning. Perhaps it will be judged that the sins of mankind are too deep, and they will all perish together, or it will prove the greatness of the forces of justice and lay the foundation for civilization. If this is not the case, how will the killing ever stop, and how will the crisis ever be eliminated? If the crisis never ends and the killing never ceases, where is the blessed man, and where is the paradise? Is this not just feigning illness and alarming people with dangerous words? Hitler, a man with no place to stand, rose from the ranks and single-handedly destroyed the international order and European peace in less than twenty years. Is it said that other continents and countries will not produce scoundrels like Hitler? The Soviet Union, using the security of its city of Leningrad as an excuse, claimed that its small neighbor was a threat and an aggressor. It unilaterally terminated the treaty of non-aggression, refused to sever diplomatic relations, refused to accept replies, interfered in the other party's internal affairs, and demanded the reorganization of the government as a condition for peace. A country must have neighbors, and national strengths must vary. If we follow the Soviet Union's logic, what excuse is there for wanting to annex? If western neighbor Finland gives way, then will it accuse southern neighbor Romania of being a threat and an aggressor? If Finland perishes, then Sweden will become its western neighbor. If Sweden is unfortunate, then Norway will become its western neighbor. If we compromise, the crisis will never end. If we resist, the killing will never cease. Expansion is endless, and there will be no peace in the international community. If this is not a final reckoning, how can the situation be resolved?

Saying this does not mean that the war between China, Japan, England, and Germany is not enough and that the world urgently needs to engage in a large-scale war: but rather, that if mankind does not lose its rationality, it should not sit idly by and watch the natural development of everything, allowing the earth to become a huge furnace! Today, regardless of the size or strength of a country or race, regardless of whether its people are colored or not, we must inquire about their true wishes: do they care about perishing together, or will they work together to lay the foundation for civilization? Gather those who embrace civilization into one group, targeting those who admire civilization and accept the principles of international fairness. They must even be prepared to pay the necessary price for laying the foundation for civilization: to end wars, to end disputes, and to seek the principles of fairness to resolve difficulties. For example, the friction and conflict between England, France, and Germany have lasted for years, ultimately leading to today's state of war. In the days before the war, it has never been heard that either side sought the principles of fairness, or at least it has never been heard that either side denied any principles from the front. Those who interacted with each other only adhered to what they believed in: beliefs must distinguish between right and wrong, but each acted as its own master without seeking justice through arbitration: once the war began, the opportunity for arbitration disappeared. For example, the crisis between the Soviet Union and Finland is on the verge of breaking out: U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement indicated a willingness to mediate. As of last night, neither side had expressed anything, but according to reports from Finland, there are rumors that the Soviet Union has already rejected mediation. If mediation is indeed rejected, then there is no possibility of arbitration. However, I believe that those who admire civilization should not give up eating because of choking: the various countries and races outside the vortex should urgently catch up, establish principles of fairness, and pledge to uphold them. Even countries like China, Japan, England, France, Germany, the Soviet Union, and Finland, all who are willing to accept the principles of fairness and international arbitration, do not need to consider the other party's attitude and can take the lead in expressing this. Although it is impossible to implement arbitration until the other party agrees, it is enough to promote the establishment of principles of fairness and advocate the use of international arbitration. Moreover, there are many more hidden international crises than those that have already erupted: the Soviet Union and Finland are fighting in Northern Europe, but have you not heard of the storms in Central Europe? Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu praised the fairness of the Treaty of Craiova only the day before yesterday, declaring that the status quo should not be changed; while Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky immediately denounced it yesterday as unfair and in urgent need of revision, otherwise the peace and tranquility of the Carpathian Mountains cannot be guaranteed. Romania and Hungary may not immediately engage in armed conflict, but in the aftermath of the agitation, who can guarantee that a single spark will not start a prairie fire? Apart from premeditated aggression, wars must arise out of desperation: they begin with disputes, and when there is no avenue for dispute resolution, conflicts and wars break out. If today's Romania and Hungary are like this, the focus of the dispute lies in the fairness of the Treaty of Craiova: in reality, is what Romania calls fair truly fair? Is what Hungary calls unfair truly unfair? If there is no standard for this, what is the meaning of calling mankind rational animals? If disputes are decided by conflicts and wars, what is the meaning of human civilization? If the countries and races that admire civilization can cooperate to establish principles of fairness, and if Romania and Hungary can work together to lay the foundation for civilization, then at least one aspect of the Central European disputes can be expected to be eliminated. Three full months have passed since the outbreak of the European war. In these three months, new lessons have been revealed, exposing barbarism and threatening civilization. With these lessons before us, those among mankind who recognize that they have a responsibility to lay the foundation for civilization must not fail to be alarmed that civilization cannot be obtained without labor? If we are lucky enough to obtain it without labor, we will see the arrival of a final reckoning by iron and blood!

### Three American Medical Experts Go to Yunnan to Eliminate Malaria: The National Government Allocates 1.8 Million Yuan as a Five-Year Fund for Malaria Elimination Work

Chongqing: At the request of the Chinese government, the U.S. Public Health Service has sent three American medical experts to China. The three experts arrived here yesterday and are preparing to carry out the work of eliminating malaria in Yunnan. The three medical experts are: (1) Dr. Williams, Director of the Medical Department of the U.S. Public Health Service; (2) Dr. Meni, also a doctor of the U.S. Public Health Service; (3) Dr. Hubshire. At the same time, Dr. Brown, an American from the American Church Hospital, will also assist the three experts in the malaria elimination work in Yunnan. It is reported that the four medical doctors are scheduled to depart on December 1 for the malaria-stricken areas of Yunnan. Since the climate there is not very hot now, the experts plan to spend the winter there until the end of February next year. Although the travel and living expenses of the experts are borne by the United States, other expenses must be assumed by the Chinese side. Therefore, the Chinese government has allocated 1.8 million yuan as a five-year budget for the malaria elimination campaign. According to Dr. Brown, malaria in Yunnan is a major threat to the workers on the Yunnan-Burma Road, a situation that is exactly the same as the Panama epidemic encountered during the construction of the Panama Canal.

### Military Affairs Commission Announces the War Situation for One Week: From the 22nd to the 28th

Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission spoke about the increasingly fierce fighting in Guangdong and Guangxi since this week (November 22nd to 28th). On the remaining fronts, there have also been repeated fierce battles. Chinese soldiers and officers have bravely risked their lives and have repeatedly dealt heavy blows to the Japanese army. In the future, wherever the Japanese set foot, they will inevitably sink deeper and deeper, and fall into a dilemma from which they cannot extricate themselves. Regarding the course of the battle, the more important aspects are described as follows:

(Guangdong and Guangxi): The Japanese army landing in Qinzhou Bay continued to advance north after arriving at the border between Guangdong and Guangxi last week. On the morning of the 23rd, a unit arrived in Liangqingxu, Yudong, Tongqingxu, and other places one after another, and was met with a head-on attack by the Chinese, suffering heavy casualties. It then sent three regiments to reinforce, and under the cover of machine guns and artillery, forcibly crossed the Yu River and launched a fierce attack on Nanning. The Chinese army fought bravely in hand-to-hand combat, fighting back and forth. The Japanese continued to send reinforcements, and the bloody battle lasted until the morning of the 26th. Because there was no defensible terrain from a tactical point of view, and the strategic goal of attrition had been achieved, the Chinese then moved to the suburbs of the city, and are currently encircling and annihilating the invading Japanese army. In addition, the Chinese army has been fiercely attacking the Japanese army in the Jiangmen area for days, achieving many victories. On the 25th and 26th, they twice attacked the city of Xinhui, burning down many Japanese barracks, warehouses, headquarters, and agencies. Another unit of the Chinese army attacked Jiujiangxu on the 28th, killing more than 400 Japanese soldiers and capturing a large number of spoils of war. As for the Japanese army on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, after entering Juntian and Baini, they launched separate attacks on Lubao to the west for days, and also attacked Yinzhan'ao to the north with a part of their forces, with a fierce offensive. The Chinese army resisted in separate locations, engaging in fierce battles for several days and nights, killing more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers. The war has now reached a stalemate. The Japanese army trapped in Chao'an in eastern Guangdong used more than 800 infantry soldiers at dawn on the 25th, under the cover of machine guns and artillery, to launch an attack on Fengxi in two routes. After being intercepted in separate locations, the fierce battle lasted all day. In the evening, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack and retreated to Chaozhou City, abandoning more than 200 corpses.

(Shanxi and Henan): There were no large-scale battles in southeastern Shanxi. After the Chinese army recovered Xiangning, Daning, Puxian, and other places in western Shanxi, the remaining Japanese retreated and entrenched themselves in Heilongguan. For days, the Chinese army continued to attack fiercely, occupying various outer strongholds. On the 22nd, they once charged into the town, killing many Japanese soldiers. Another unit of the (illegible) army recovered Qingxiangzhen and forced an attack on Fenxi County, causing the Japanese to retreat in a panic, suffering heavy losses. Out of shame and anger, the Japanese then drew thousands of people from Lishi, Liulin, and Dawu, and launched a three-pronged attack on Qikouzhen, attempting to contain the Chinese army. One route followed the Lishi Highway to Meijiacha and is currently engaged in a fierce battle in the Wanglaoposhi area. One route harassed Mengmen (south of Qikou) from Liulin to the north, and was met with a head-on attack. One route divided from Dawuzhen and advanced via Dashancun and Maota Man, intending to attack Hujiata, but was intercepted by the Chinese garrison. The Japanese suffered hundreds of casualties. On the 24th, fierce battles raged all day on each route. By nightfall, the entire Japanese line was shaken and retreated in disarray. A small number of remaining Japanese were still closely besieged by the Chinese army and unable to break through. In eastern Henan, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese for days. A unit forced its way to the suburbs of Taikang on the morning of the 23rd, launching a siege. Another unit attacked the Caitun Station and the northwest of Kaifeng on the 27th, destroying many Japanese military vehicles and killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers. In southern Henan, more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers who were harassing Chenjiadian from the area of Xinyang and Changtaiguan were repeatedly attacked, suffering heavy casualties. The remaining Japanese retreated along the original route, and the Chinese army is currently attacking. (To be continued)

The export of bristles last year reached 28,000,000 yuan in foreign exchange. As for the first nine months of this year, the export of bristles reached 10,590 dan, valued at HK$5 million.

### Villages Along the Ping Sui Railway Completely Burned

Wuyuan: The Japanese army in Sui recently ordered the residents within four or five miles of the Pingsui Railway to relocate completely. All the villages along the southern foothills of Daqing Mountain, from Zhuozishan in the east to Baotou in the west, were burned to the ground in order to encircle Daqing Mountain and prevent the Chinese army from advancing east. Currently, thirteen of the seventeen villages affiliated with Renhex township near the Tao Wuqi Station in eastern Sui have been cleared by the Japanese army. (Telegraph from the 29th)

### Molotov Announces to the Soviet People, Denouncing the Finnish Government for Retrogressive Actions, Still Willing to Guarantee Finnish Independence and Autonomy

Moscow: Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, broadcast a speech late on the 29th, saying, "Male and female citizens of the Soviet Union, the hostile policies adopted by the current Finnish government towards our country have forced us to take direct steps to ensure the security of our country's borders. As you all know, for two months, our government has been negotiating with the Finnish government, discussing with patience various proposals to ensure the minimum security of our country, especially Leningrad, in the current international panic situation. Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Finnish government adopted a firm hostile attitude towards our country. Not only did it not seek coordination in a friendly manner, but it also took retrogressive actions, flattering the imperialist powers that instigated anti-Soviet sentiments. Disregarding all the concessions made by our country, it ultimately led to the fruitless breakdown of negotiations. As a result, the Finnish border warlords have recently begun to brazenly provoke, even shelling our troops near Leningrad, causing the death and injury of many of our soldiers. Our government still adhered to the principle of settling matters peacefully and offered practical suggestions to the Finnish government, hoping to prevent the continued occurrence of provocative incidents. However, the Finnish rulers still responded with hostile policies, as stated in the government's reply published yesterday. They even used hostile rejections, shameless denials of facts, insults to our country's victims, and a blatant attempt to permanently place Leningrad under the threat of their army to repay our country's suggestions. All of this clearly shows that the current Finnish government still firmly maintains a hostile attitude towards our country, is unwilling to abide by the provisions of the Treaty of Non-Aggression between the two countries, and is determined to keep our Leningrad permanently under the threat of their military force. From this government and its utterly irrational warlords, there is nothing else to hope for other than new barbaric provocations. Therefore, our government was forced to declare yesterday that the Soviet Union would no longer accept the binding of the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Non-Aggression, which had been destroyed by the Finnish government itself. Furthermore, because the Finnish warlords continued to attack the Soviet troops on the border, our government had to make new decisions. Our government cannot tolerate the current situation, and the entire responsibility should be borne by the Finnish government. Our government has now decided that it cannot continue to maintain normal diplomatic relations with the Finnish government, and has ordered the immediate recall of all political and economic representatives stationed in Finland. In addition, the government has also ordered the general headquarters of the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force to prepare for any unexpected events and to immediately stop any possible new attacks by the Finnish warlords. Foreign newspapers hostile to our country have falsely claimed that the steps we have taken are aimed at seizing Finnish territory. This is purely malicious slander. The Soviet government has absolutely no such intention. On the contrary, if Finland itself pursues a friendly policy towards our country, the Soviet government, which has always strived for friendship with Finland, is still willing to negotiate and compromise at any time, and is even willing to cede its own territory to that country. In this regard, the Soviet government is willing to consider in good faith the reunification of the Karelian people currently living in the main areas of Soviet Karelia with the Finnish people of the same race in a single, independent Finland, and other similar issues. However, this must be conditional on the Finnish government abandoning its hostility towards the Soviet Union and adopting a friendly attitude that is in line with the interests of both countries. Others have also falsely claimed that the steps we have taken are aimed at harming Finnish independence and interfering in its domestic and foreign affairs. This is also malicious slander. Regardless of the Finnish political system, we have always recognized it as an independent and autonomous country in its domestic and foreign affairs. We firmly believe that the Finnish people should decide all their domestic and foreign affairs themselves. The Soviet people have helped Finland gain independence in the past, and will continue to assist the people of that country in guaranteeing their free and independent development in the future. The Soviet Union has no intention of harming the interests of other countries in Finland. The relationship between Finland and other countries is purely its own affair, and the Soviet Union has no right to interfere. The purpose of the steps taken by our country is purely to guarantee the security of the Soviet Union, especially Leningrad, which has a population of 3.5 million. In the current international atmosphere heated by war, we cannot allow the decision on this important national issue to depend on the malice of the current Finnish rulers. This issue must be resolved by the Soviet Union itself and in friendly cooperation with the Finnish people. Once the issue of guaranteeing the security of Leningrad is resolved in a satisfactory manner, the diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Finland will be able to obtain a permanent foundation of friendship. This can be asserted with certainty." (Telegraph from TASS on the 30th)

### Soviet Union Recalls Envoys to Finland

Moscow: Bogdan Kim, Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, acting on government instructions, personally handed a note signed by People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov to Finnish Minister Yeke Kinnan yesterday. The note declared that the Soviet government believed that it could not maintain normal diplomatic relations with Finland because of the continuous incursions of Finnish troops into Soviet territory, and had therefore decided to recall all political and economic representatives stationed in Finland. (TASS dispatch of the 30th)

### Finland's Range of Concessions to the Soviet Union

London: A Finnish official spokesman told a United Press reporter last night that the Finnish government would cede the Eastern Ge Island near Leningrad to the Soviet Union, but Finland could not make further concessions that would undermine its existing defense works.

### French Parliament Reconvenes: Daladier Reports on the War Situation, Asserts That the Strength of Britain and France Is Sufficient to Ensure Victory; The Key to Victory Lies in the Increase and Decrease of Moral Strength

Paris: Prime Minister Daladier and his cabinet colleague (illegible), earlier today, read government statements in the House and Senate respectively. They stated briefly, "French soldiers have answered the call of the nation and gone to the front with firm determination. For nearly three months, they have been able to fight with the same enthusiasm, selfless sacrifice, freedom, rights, personality, and general sense of justice on all three fronts: land, sea, and air. As far as land is concerned, our troops are demonstrating their power every day, proving their value. As far as the sky is concerned, the air forces of both Britain and France have defeated the enemy. As far as the sea is concerned, the fleets of Britain and France have contained the offensive of the enemy submarines. The reason why Germany has resumed mine warfare to strike at the ships of Britain, France, and neutral countries is probably because of this. As for the war situation, it has already reversed our expectations. The enemy is defending behind the (illegible) defensive fortifications and has concentrated a large number of troops to prepare for mobile warfare. The troops of Britain and France can also work together, and are sufficient to deter the enemy from wherever they attack. One thing must be explained to the people of the country: although the way this war is being waged is not what we expected, it is not unfavorable to us. This is something that our soldiers are well aware of. Even if the war reports issued by the Commander-in-Chief say that the front line is calm and uneventful, we are already sufficient to bring about victory with strong, persistent, and resolute actions, to make it come as soon as possible, and to reduce the number of casualties to a minimum. Moreover, the key to victory or defeat depends not only on military actions, but also on the evolution of international politics and the increase and decrease of moral strength. Since September 2 of this year, Poland has been tragically divided. The strong connection between Britain and France is for the final victory. Some aspects have fabricated rumors that the sacrifices made by Britain and France in this war are unequal. This is a futile effort. As far as the international situation is concerned, Turkey has signed a treaty of mutual assistance with Britain and France on October 19 of this year, which has contributed greatly to maintaining peace in the Balkan Peninsula. US President Roosevelt issued an appeal to Germany and Poland in August of this year, advocating the establishment of a fair solution. Such noble actions are commendable. Later, the US Congress passed the New Neutrality Act, repealing the arms embargo clauses. Pope Pius XII issued an encyclical on October 27 of this year, emphasizing that international relations should be based on respect for the national rights of all countries and respect for existing treaties. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini (illegible)."

### Communist Party Members Forcibly Enter the Venue, Obstructing Daladier's Speech

Paris: After the House of Representatives reconvened this morning, Speaker Herriot delivered a speech paying tribute to the soldiers at the front. All members of parliament stood in silence. Prime Minister Daladier then read the government declaration. When he reached the middle of his speech, two Communist Party members, Pondet and Guelnam, suddenly broke into the venue. Because the Communist Party in this country had already been dissolved, the members of parliament stood up to oppose them. The Prime Minister had no choice but to stop speaking until the police removed the two Communist Party members from the venue, after which he continued to read the declaration. After listening to the declaration, the members of parliament unanimously approved it. The Prime Minister then mentioned the close cooperation between Britain and France, and the efforts of US President (illegible) to maintain peace. The members of parliament applauded warmly. Finally, the Prime Minister also said, "Traitors will never be allowed to break into Parliament." In addition, when the Senate reconvened this morning, Speaker Jananan delivered a speech, the general idea of which was the same as that of House Speaker Herriot. Afterwards, Cabinet Secretary (illegible) read the government declaration. The Senate then decided to continue the (illegible) at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

### Naval Minister of France Announces: Germany Has Lost More Than Thirty Submarines, Accounting For Over Fifty Percent of Its Total Number; Over 200,000 Tons of Contraband Intercepted

Paris: Naval Minister Campinchi recently made a speech to various newspapers, discussing Germany's submarine and mine warfare, as well as countermeasures. He stated that since the beginning of the war, Germany has lost about thirty submarines, which is more than fifty percent of its total submarine fleet. In recent days alone, three submarines have been sunk, one of which was sunk by a seaplane. Over the past twenty years, although submarine construction has been repeatedly improved, mainly in terms of engines and weapons, their speed has not increased, and their vulnerability remains the same. Conversely, defensive measures have greatly improved. During the last European war, Germany had one hundred and fifty submarines, of which only twenty-one were sunk by the Allied Powers, accounting for only fourteen percent of the total. Compared to the current sinking rate, the difference is immeasurable. Furthermore, the tonnage of British and French ships sunk by German submarines and mines is only four hundred thousand tons. Recently, Germany has been using magnetic mines, and Britain and France are now finding ways to remove them. It should be known that when new weapons appear, defensive measures also arise accordingly. As for the blockade, within the first sixty-eight days of the war, the British and French navies intercepted 223,000 tons of contraband bound for Germany. In short, all the measures taken by our navy are effective and promising. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

London: The Ministry of Economic Warfare recently announced that the British Navy inspected 134 merchant ships during the week of November 19th to 25th, including twenty-one Italian ships, twenty-eight Norwegian ships, nineteen Dutch ships, twenty British ships, and fifteen Greek ships. Ninety-seven of these ships have been released. In addition, our military

### Romanian Foreign Minister Opposes Changing the Status Quo; Hungarian Foreign Minister Expresses Dissatisfaction

Bucharest: Foreign Minister Gafencu delivered an important speech in the Senate today, explaining foreign policy, stating: "This European war has no impact on our country's interests, independence, and territorial integrity. Therefore, we have strictly adhered to neutrality from the beginning. However, if our country is threatened, we will defend our territory with all our strength. Our foreign policy has always been to cooperate with other countries. We have signed commercial agreements with Britain and France, and these countries also guarantee our country's independence. We have been able to redouble our efforts to promote friendly relations with our neighbors. As for the Soviet Union, we firmly believe that there is no conflict between the destinies of our two nations. Therefore, we have paid close attention to the negotiations previously conducted by the Soviet Union and Turkey. Although these negotiations have been temporarily suspended, the friendly relations between the two sides remain intact, which is gratifying. As for Italy, in accordance with its historical mission, it strives to preserve the order of Europe, preventing it from being destroyed by war. It will surely have a profound and positive impact on Eastern Europe. As for Hungary, the Hungarian government expressed concern to our country on August 24th this year due to our country's strengthening of border defenses. I immediately provided a concrete answer, willing to sign a non-aggression treaty with it. Although the Hungarian authorities have not yet submitted a reply, the Balkan Entente countries have already decided on various principles at their meeting last year. Our country will naturally continue to seek a compromise with Hungary based on these principles. The content of the Treaty of Trianon (the peace treaty with Hungary after the last European War) is not unfair. It only reorganized Hungary before the last European War, that is, a country composed of several ethnic minorities under the control of one ethnic group, and replaced it with a nation-based country. That is all. Hungary has already accepted this view regarding Yugoslavia, and it is hoped that it will adopt the same attitude towards our country in the future. But in any case, the current situation cannot be changed at this time." (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

Bucharest: After Foreign Minister Gafencu explained foreign policy in the Senate yesterday, Professor Yaulga, a legal advisor and senator, gave a speech stating that although Poland has fallen, it will surely be restored. He also expressed gratitude for the guarantee of our country's existing borders by Britain and France. "We must not forget this spirit of chivalry from Britain and France when the war is over. At that time, the rights of all countries will be upheld. In the past, Germany suffered greatly and took a long time to complete its unification. It should understand this," he said. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)

Budapest: Regarding the statement by Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu that the Treaty of Trianon is not unfair and should not be revised, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky made a speech to the Hungarian News Agency, commenting: "At this time, it is no longer possible for the Romanian authorities to insist on this statement. For the sake of peace in our country and Central Europe, I must protest against anyone who wants to revive the spirit of the various peace treaties of the last European War. I am convinced that any impartial international body will consider the Treaty of Trianon to be unfair and in need of urgent revision. In short, if Romania continues to regard itself as a beneficiary of the last European War, then security and peace in the Carpathian Mountains will be difficult to ensure," he said.

### Stalin Refutes Rumors, Says "Havas News Agency Café Politicians" Distort Facts and Close Doors to Build Cars (Fabricate)

Moscow: The editor of Pravda recently wrote to Stalin, saying: "Havas News Agency recently released a message stating that Stalin gave a speech at the Politburo on August 19th," in which Stalin said, "The war should be prolonged as much as possible so that both belligerent parties are exhausted." I wonder what Mr. Stalin's opinion is on this message." Stalin personally replied, "This message from Havas News Agency is completely fabricated, like many other messages from that agency. I cannot know where this rumor was fabricated in a café, but no matter how Havas News Agency fabricates rumors, they cannot deny the following points, namely: First, Germany did not attack Britain and France, but Britain and France attacked Germany, thereby taking responsibility for this war; Second, after the outbreak of the war, Germany still made peace proposals to Britain and France, and the Soviet Union publicly supported them, because the Soviet Union has always believed that an early end to the war would fundamentally ease the situation of all countries; Third, the ruling class of Britain and France have brazenly rejected Germany's peace proposals and the Soviet Union's efforts to end the war early. All of the above are facts. How can the café politicians of Havas News Agency deny them?" (TASS dispatch on the 29th)

Bucharest: After receiving news that the Soviet Union was concentrating large armies in Central Asia and the Caucasus, political figures here are paying close attention. Public opinion is focusing on discussing the Soviet Union's motives for taking this step. The general opinion is that the purpose of this military measure by the Soviet Union is to deal with France's increase in troops in Syria, Britain's increase in troops in Egypt, and Turkey's increase in troops in Eastern Anatolia. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 30th)

### Japan Negotiates Commercial Treaty with France

Tokyo: Trade between Japan and France is based on the Japan-France Provisional Commercial Agreement concluded in June of this year. However, since the outbreak of the European War, France has restricted important exports and imports, making it difficult to implement the agreement in practice. Therefore, there has been talk between the two countries about a new treaty. The Japanese government recently inquired with the French government about the limits on the amount of important French products to be supplied to Japan in the future, and the possible scope of Japanese purchases of French goods. As a result, the two countries are scheduled to begin formal negotiations next month to conclude a new commercial treaty. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 30th) We have not yet launched anything, so we have not reached a large-scale and fierce level. This matter is fought for our safety and freedom, is force majeure. In addition to invading Poland, Germany also wants to establish hegemony in Europe with a systematic will, sometimes in the name of racism, and sometimes in disregard of this doctrine, so that other nations become vassals. The creed we pursue is to cherish life and reduce suffering, while at the same time hoarding various powerful weapons with all our strength, so as to fully grasp and minimize losses, defeat Germany's future offensive, and achieve victory. We not only retain the Maginot Line, but also countless lines of defense and barriers and outposts, in order to protect our country's territory like never before. The two countries not only have the same ideals and interests, but also coordinate all moral, material and military resources. The two countries have hesitated in the past, and their opinions have been divided for many years. Today, a true alliance has been established. The results obtained from this are far from what could be achieved during the last European War. When the joint meeting of the highest national defense committees of the two countries was held on the 17th of this month, a large-scale plan for joint action in all aspects was adopted. In short, the political and military front lines of Britain and France have the unlimited resources of the two major empires as their backing. This strong group has the determination to overcome all difficulties and will surely achieve a victory. Lini has also made many efforts to maintain peace. The country's policies in the past three months have made great contributions to maintaining peace in the Mediterranean. In addition, the relationship between France and Spain has also improved. France's diplomatic situation is as described above, and Germany's isolation in the world can also be seen from this. Britain and France use force only to prevent others from abusing force, and will not lay down their arms until the unfair treatment suffered by someone is corrected. All European countries have the right to maintain security, and the security system must be strengthened and promoted to all countries in Europe. As far as the present is concerned, we must first achieve victory, and what we should devote all our efforts to is that." (Havas dispatch on the 30th) Continue the meeting.

Paris: French Communist Party Congressman Zidong, who once served as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Party, was dissolved by the government after the outbreak of the war, and party members were arrested. Zidong was also among them. He recently surrendered to the police authorities, saying that he no longer belongs to any party and is prepared to issue a public statement. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

### German Plane Lands in Danish Territory

Copenhagen: A German plane was recently forced to land in the Faroe Islands, a Danish territory. The Danish authorities have detained it and arrested four pilots. (Havas dispatch on the 30th), on average, is far less than in 1917 (when the average was 500,000 tons per month). Germany has failed to win by submarine warfare in the past, let alone now. At this time, Britain and France have prepared sound defenses, the tonnage of ships sunk has been greatly reduced, and the number of German submarines sunk has been increasing day by day. Even if all the shipyards in the country devote all their efforts to building submarines, they will not be able to create a sufficient number before September 1940 to pose a serious threat to us. As for mine warfare, during the last European War, Germany laid mines all over the sea without issuing a notice. According to the data in 1917, 6 million tons of ships were destroyed, of which ships were hit. During the same period, more than 11,000 tons of goods were intercepted to Germany, of which 11,000 tons were kerosene. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)

Parin: Germany is paying close attention to the opposition of neutral countries to the new British and French blockade policy. Responsible persons here believe that this new blockade measure is in retaliation for Germany's torpedo warfare, and the result is nothing less than expanding the blockade policy to the shipping industry of neutral countries. Moreover, Germany's torpedo warfare is not an illegal act, but is permitted by international law. On the contrary, the retaliatory measures taken by Britain and France have no legal basis and violate the Declaration of Paris. According to the declaration, enemy goods transported by neutral countries that are not wartime contraband should not be confiscated (Haitong

### Britain's Annual War Expenses: 2.4 Billion Pounds; Two-Thirds More Than Last War; Simon Calls on the Whole Country to Donate

London: Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the funds used by Britain for war and other matters currently amount to 2,400,000,000 pounds per year, which is two-thirds more than the expenses of the last war. The annual tax revenue is 1,000,000,000 pounds, and another 1,000,000,000 pounds must be raised to meet this year's expenditures. If the war progresses throughout the year, with more ammunition and more lives lost, the expenses required will be even greater. The current annual expenditure rate is about half of the total income of the people. There are 10,000 people in the country with an annual income of 10,000 pounds or more, and their total income amounts to 180,000,000 pounds. However, this amount is only enough to maintain the country's war for a week or ten days. Property tax has already obtained 160,000,000 pounds from this amount. The general public believes that heavily taxing the rich can solve the financial problems during the war. From this, an answer can be obtained, that is, the rich have already borne a very heavy burden and have no surplus capacity to raise funds. Therefore, the only way for a democratic country to cope with such terrible war expenses is for the people of the whole country to voluntarily donate. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)

### German Newspapers Review War Goals

Berlin: The "German General Newspaper" and "People's Observer" here both published editorials today, reviewing Germany's war goals, which are generally regarded as instructed by senior political figures. The "German General Newspaper" declared that the goal of Germany's war is to liberate Europe under British hegemony. If Britain does not insist on continuing to disturb the natural balance of Europe, then the Treaty of Versailles will not be signed. Europe liberated from British hegemony is a stable Europe with a natural balance of all countries. This is the fixed goal of Hitler's foreign policy, which will seek the boundaries of the scope of influence of all parties. This boundary has been agreed by Italy and the Soviet Union. If Britain does not use force as a tool to determine the fate of Europe, then France and the British Empire will also express their agreement. The "People's Observer" declared that Britain's continental blockade policy is a method of terror, and Germany's mission is to liberate Europe from Britain's arbitrary control.

### Germany's Petroleum Mostly Used Up

New York: The New York Times today carried an article stating that Germany's complete isolation from the world's major oil markets can be seen in official statistics and other news. According to news obtained from Washington, Germany consumed most of its prepared gasoline when it attacked Poland. Since then, it has been unable to make large-scale supplements. This situation may prove the reason why the British and French air forces have no German troops flying in formation and the German army has not taken an offensive on the Western Front. The United States exported a total of 7 million barrels of crude oil and 4 million barrels of gasoline in September. According to the figures for October, Germany did not receive any oil, and the situation in November is likely to be similar. According to official intelligence, the Soviet Union is also unable to take care of its oil production and may not be able to provide Germany with large-scale assistance.

### British and German Machines in Fierce Air Combat

Berlin: According to official announcements here, a German reconnaissance plane engaged in fierce air combat with a British fighter plane in Northumberland, England, yesterday. The German reconnaissance plane was flying at a high altitude when it suddenly saw a British fighter plane appear in the clouds, closely following and continuously firing machine guns. The German plane was hit by several bullets, but did not damage any vital parts. The British plane chased to a distance of fifty meters, and a fierce battle ensued. As a result, the Central Plane abandoned the chase, and the German plane returned safely. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 30th)

### Director of the German War History Research Institute Discusses the Command of Modern Armies

Berlin: Colonel Forster, Director of the German War History Research Institute, gave a speech in Breslau yesterday entitled "The Qualifications of Leaders of Modern Armies," stating that General Moltke, the predecessor, created the leader of the modern army. Since then, the superior position of the army leader commanding the war has ceased to exist. In Germany's war in Poland this time, the army leaders were able to make good use of the army's technological development to complete their tasks. Although the army's combat technology has changed, the principle of leadership command is still based on Moltke's theory. As for the situation on the Western Front, a large-scale positional war has not yet begun, but modern war tactics are different from the last great war. In addition to military weapons, it is also necessary to use diplomacy, politics, economy, and spirit, and concentrate the strength of all aspects to engage in modern warfare.

### US Public Opinion Towards Japan Increasingly Worsens; Unanimous Opposition to the "New Order in East Asia"; Churches Demand a Ban on Arms Shipments to Japan

Tokyo: Asahi Shimbun director Suzuki, who was traveling in the United States, telegraphed the newspaper yesterday, confirming that after US Ambassador to Japan Grew recently delivered a speech to the Japanese people in Tokyo, US public opinion has unanimously opposed Japan's "New Order in East Asia." According to Suzuki's telegram, "US public opinion towards Japan is extremely bad and is likely to worsen further." Although there are currently two factions in US public opinion towards Japan, both oppose Japan's "New Order in East Asia." The first faction advocates taking a tough policy towards Japan and economic sanctions to retaliate against "Japan's infringement of US interests in China." The second faction advocates taking a more moderate policy, but demands that Japan reopen the Yangtze River and guarantee that it will respect US interests in China in the future.

Cincinnati: Bishop Hobson here wrote to the South Ohio Episcopal Church, calling the United States' sale of weapons and military supplies to Japan "the greatest stain in American history." Bishop Hobson urged church leaders to write to state congressional representatives and Secretary of State Hull, requesting a cessation of trade with Japan. Bishop Hobson also said that the United States expresses sympathy to China on the one hand, donating money to relieve people suffering from the war, and supplying Japan with weapons on the other hand, which is hypocritical.

### Japanese Currency Increasingly Inflated; Banknote Issue Reaches New Record

Tokyo: According to a survey by the Bank of Japan on the 30th, the amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan was 2.923 billion yen, breaking the highest record of 2.838 billion yen in December last year. The amount of issues outside its restrictions also reached 221 million yen. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 30th)

### British Blockade of German Trade Disadvantageous to Japan; Negotiations Still Underway; Japanese Navy Makes No Comment

Tokyo: When Navy Department spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa greeted newspaper reporters this morning, a foreign reporter asked what action the Japanese Navy would take if the British Navy discovered German exports on Japanese ships and confiscated them. The spokesman replied that he only learned from newspaper reports that Britain would begin blockading German exports on December 4. This matter is currently in diplomatic talks between Britain and Japan, and he cannot disclose the attitude of the Japanese Navy. However, Japan should, of course, uphold its rights as a neutral country. Japan should take a firm stance on this matter. According to his opinion, today's editorials in the Jiji Shinpo and Yomiuri Shimbun, urging the government to take "strong countermeasures against British and French shipping when the British and French confiscate German exports carried by Japanese ships," reflect Japanese sentiment. When a British reporter asked whether the Japanese Navy could in principle not recognize the British blockade of German exports, Kanazawa replied that as a naval officer, he could easily understand the motives and countermeasures planned by the British Navy to deal with German mines and submarine warfare. However, because the Japanese government has declared a policy of non-interference in the European War, and because retaliatory and confrontational actions have the danger of producing serious consequences, as proven by the United States being drawn into the last great war, he will not give a definite answer here. Today's Yomiuri Shimbun editorial stated that merchants and shipping companies are demanding that the government take "strong action." If Japanese ships are detained, or German exports carried by Japanese ships are confiscated by the British and French authorities, the Japanese government should retaliate against British and French shipping. The actions of the British and French governments are a violation of public law, and the Japanese government also views it as such. If Japanese ships are detained, the Japanese authorities will have reason to detain Central French ships or confiscate British and French goods at Japanese and Chinese ports. According to Japanese sources, Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura told British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie this morning that Japan will adhere to its established policy, as notified to Britain on November 24, and will not agree to Britain's confiscation of German exports on the high seas. Japan takes this attitude because it fears that interests vital to Japan's survival will be affected by this move by Britain. Japanese sources also said that the meeting between Craigie and Nomura was held at 11:30 this morning, when the British ambassador handed over a formal reply to the Japanese protest of November 24 and indicated that the British government intended to give full consideration to taking cautious measures to avoid possible damage to neutral countries when implementing the decision to confiscate German exports. The British Embassy has not confirmed this news. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)

### American Highway Expert Talks Freely About the General Situation of Transportation in China; Highway Transportation in Guangxi is Obstructed Due to the War, But the Impact on Resource Input is Minimal

Chongqing - Since the outbreak of war in Guangxi, the highway leading from Nanning to the border of French Vietnam has been temporarily blocked. The impact of this on China's access to external resources has been a matter of great concern. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed American highway expert Xue Heng on this matter, who said that although the highway to Nanning is temporarily suspended due to the war in the nearby area, and the input of resources through that route is temporarily blocked, judging from the current overall transportation situation of your country, the temporary blockage of this line has minimal impact. Now that the rainy season is over, your country can import large quantities of goods without restriction via a certain location by highway, and the facilities along that route are far more advanced than those on the Nanning highway. In South China, the rainy season this year brought unprecedented heavy rainfall. Even the railway in Myanmar was temporarily suspended, but your country's Dian-Sha Highway continued to operate as usual without any obstruction. I personally witnessed ten or twenty landslides on this new highway in just one section, but traffic continued to flow smoothly, and large quantities of goods continued to be transported into the interior through this route. Your country's roads are well-connected in all directions, so there is absolutely no problem with the import of foreign goods. The highway from Nanning is just one section of the overall network, and it has not been repaired in any way for several months. With the outbreak of the war in Guangxi, this road is fundamentally unusable. In recent days, the residents of Guangxi have been using the method of diverting water to restore the road to its pre-construction state, so the Japanese army is also unable to use it. The branch and main roads in various parts of South China are interconnected, so goods can be transported, which is a major feature of road administration in South China. In Guangxi, it will only take a few weeks to find a way to connect the branch roads and old roads in various places, and it will become an ideal passage, only with more curves and longer distances. The roadbeds of these old roads are mostly stone slabs, which your country has used to drive livestock and transport people and goods for centuries. The plan now is to lift the stone slabs, place them on both sides, and then pave them with gravel and fine sand so that cars can pass. The construction of the southwest highways in your country was completed extremely quickly, thanks to the old roads. Moreover, there is another new highway in Guangxi that will be completed by the end of December. Using the old road is only a contingency measure. Your country has been planning to build new highways for a long time, and now they are about to be completed and can be used to replace the old highways. The new highway is several hundred kilometers shorter than the old highway from the border to Hechi in northern Guangxi. The roadbed of the new highway is much smoother than the old highway, and there are fewer curves. The entire project is far more perfect. In addition, there are at least four more highways currently under construction. In general, road administration in the southwest is progressing extremely rapidly. Under the leadership of Minister Zhang Jia'ao, the Ministry of Communications is constantly seeking to improve the transportation efficiency and speed of China, implementing centralized management to unify transportation. The previous determination to experiment with the use of improved wooden boats, equipped with American motors, to facilitate transportation was successful and is commendable. Furthermore, the Ministry of Communications has now stipulated that highways should be divided into several sections, and drivers are only responsible for driving certain sections and do not have to drive the entire route. With this improvement, the 24-hour driving system on the southwest highways should be able to be implemented, it is said. According to reports, within this year, the Ministry of Communications has made every effort to improve or rebuild various important highways across the country, and at the same time, it has also sought to unify road administration in various places and implement centralized management, so that it can conform to economic principles and efficiency can also be improved. This matter has received much assistance and support from American highway experts such as Xue Heng. Xue Heng previously inspected road administration in the southwest and worked extremely hard. Judging from the various points he described, it can be seen that a new era in the history of our country's highways is not far away. (30th dispatch)

### After the Outbreak of the European War, Overseas Chinese in Nanyang Get New Opportunities; The Amount of Remittances from Overseas Chinese to Fujian is Very Large; Nanyang Abolishes Restrictions on the Import of Overseas Chinese

Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the surge in foreign exchange rates, Fujianese compatriots residing in Nanyang have been enthusiastically remitting funds back home. In the southern Fujian area alone, the average monthly remittance of overseas Chinese funds has reached a huge sum of 8 million yuan. In addition to maintaining the lives of overseas Chinese families, most of these remittances are used to purchase farmland or build houses. Some are even hoarded at home, or even indulge in gambling, which not only violates economic principles but also degrades the morality of the people. The provincial government has now issued a proclamation to guide three uses of overseas remittances: (1) Purchase government bonds or make national construction savings; (2) Deposit in banks for ordinary fixed or current savings; (3) Purchase fields and gardens, or invest in land reclamation and various productive vegetable businesses. In this way, the capital is both reliable and profitable, and the hard-earned money of overseas Chinese can be kept rich forever. It has been found that in Yongchun, Nan'an, Jinjiang and other counties in southern Fujian, the price of farmland has soared due to the excessive number of overseas Chinese dependents purchasing it. In Yongchun, the mortgage price of farmland was only 20 or 30 yuan per "jinzhong" (unit of land), but it has now risen to 60 or 70 yuan. The selling price was previously only 120 or 130 yuan per "jinzhong," but it has now risen to 270 or 280 yuan. In Nan'an, the mortgage price per "douzhong" (unit of land) was only 40 or 50 yuan, but it has now risen to around 100 yuan. The selling price was previously 160 or 170 yuan, but it has now risen to 700 or 800 yuan. The price increase is especially high for land near the city (mostly used for building houses) and fertile land. Buyers mostly want to sever all ties, while sellers only want to meet their current urgent needs, so they all want to retain the right to redeem the land. Therefore, the price increase for selling is much greater than for mortgaging. For example, in Putou and Furong villages in the third district of Nan'an County, each "douzhong" of farmland has been sold for 1,000 yuan, which is a particularly abnormal development. As for the situation in Nanyang, according to those who have recently returned to Fujian from Singapore, the price of rubber, the largest product in Nanyang, has been declining for years. Each "dan" (unit of weight) is only worth more than 30 yuan. If it is sold according to the market price, it is only enough to cover the wages of harvesting workers. Therefore, there are very few transactions on the market, which has a huge impact on other industries. Even all copper, tin, iron and other mineral products have mostly stopped being mined, so many Chinese workers have lost their jobs. The local government then restricted the import of Chinese people. Since the outbreak of the Second European War, the price of rubber suddenly soared by 5 yuan per unit in one day. Since then, the market has been getting better every day. Now each "dan" has risen to more than 60 yuan, and market transactions have suddenly become active. Due to the war, the various hardware and minerals such as copper, tin, iron and lead are also being actively mined. For a time, there was a huge need for labor. The Chinese workers who had previously lost their jobs were all hired, and it was still not enough. Therefore, in addition to expanding recruitment, it is also appropriate to announce the opening up of the import of Chinese and various Asian people without restrictions. At present, all kinds of businesses in Nanyang have improved. Even the price of rice and beans in Myanmar has risen due to the purchase of foreign goods and the accumulation of military supplies. Chinese merchants in various places have expanded their operations, and rubber plantations that have been abandoned for a long time are all being harvested or reorganized. Remittances have also been more than before. No fewer than 3,000 or 4,000 people from southern Fujian go abroad to make a living every month (these people going abroad must be approved for a certificate after the local government has verified that they have no military service relationship). It has been found that these people going abroad all board ships in Quanzhou and go abroad after spending one or two nights in Gulangyu. Most of them are taken by the Japanese to Xiamen for interrogation. The same is true for those returning to China from Nanyang via Gulangyu, in an attempt to connect with overseas Chinese, prosper Xiamen Island, and establish an overseas Chinese association in Xiamen as an organ for wooing. Overseas Chinese entering and leaving the country mostly regard Gulangyu as a dangerous place. The American merchant Atlantic Steamship Company has now sent a special ship to sail directly to Quanzhou and the Philippines, without stopping at Gulangyu, to avoid being detained. Its first ship, the "Da Meihang," arrived in Quanzhou from the Philippines on the 18th and will be able to take passengers to the Philippines on the 21st.

### There Are Only 500 Japanese Troops in Suzhou

Suzhou Correspondence: The number of Japanese troops in Suzhou City was at most five or six thousand. Since the beginning of this month, after most of them were transferred to Hunan and Jiangxi to fight, there are very few remaining. On the 24th, the Hirose unit held a ceremony to commemorate the first anniversary of its establishment. There were only 500 Japanese soldiers participating in the exercise on the large parade ground, which is sufficient to prove its emptiness. Therefore, vigilance has recently been implemented, and Chinese coolies are prohibited from entering to work, so as not to know its inside story. Late at night on the 23rd, the Chinese army in the suburbs of the county attacked the town of Lumu, five kilometers from the city, again. When the Chinese army rushed to the town, the puppet police personnel fled far away upon hearing the news. Therefore, the Chinese army destroyed the puppet office. That night, Zhu Jiting, the puppet village director of the town, telegraphed the Japanese army for help, but the Japanese army did not dare to go, and only fired rifles indiscriminately in the area outside Qidou. The Chinese army also returned to its original defense because it did not encounter the Japanese army. The Japanese army here, because the Chinese army is very active in the Taihu Lake area, built the Mu-Xu Highway (Mudu-Xukou) specifically in Xukou (the entrance to Taihu Lake in Wu County). The entire road is four kilometers long and five meters wide, connecting Xukou to Mudu, and then connecting to the Su-Mu Highway (Suzhou-Mudu). They also built a watchtower and a fortress outside the town of Xukou to strengthen their defense.

### Japan Seeks New Outlets for Goods to the Philippines; The Quantity of Goods Posing as Chinese Goods is Very Large; The Overseas Chinese Are Planning a Boycott

Manila Correspondence: After the outbreak of the European War, the number of Japanese goods shipped to Europe decreased greatly, and the goods from European belligerent countries such as Britain and Germany shipped to the Philippines were also not as many as in the past. In order to remedy the loss of reduced shipments to Europe and to seize the markets of Britain, France and other countries in the Philippines, the Japanese tried every means to find a new outlet for Japanese goods in the Philippines, especially cloth. However, the Japanese were constrained by the Gentlemen's Agreement between the United States and Japan, and the import of Japanese cloth could not exceed a fixed quota. Therefore, they came up with a clever idea to smuggle Japanese goods into the Philippines as Chinese goods, which were not restricted, and could also take advantage of the patriotic psychology of overseas Chinese to deceive the overseas Chinese community for profit. They transported cloth manufactured in factories in Japan or in occupied areas to Hong Kong or Shanghai, re-labeled them with the trademarks of certain Chinese manufacturers, and then came to the Philippines for sale. Hong Kong is a free port, and Japanese goods can pass through without hindrance. As for Shanghai, China previously had a commodity inspection bureau, but it has been temporarily suspended since the Chinese army withdrew. Therefore, Japanese goods can be transported to Shanghai as they please. Since September of this year, Japanese goods posing as Chinese goods have been entering the Philippines in large quantities. The Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Association reported this and set up a boycott subcommittee to investigate and boycott. It has been found that hundreds of boxes of "fake national cloth" have already been shipped in, and the quantity is extremely alarming. There are more than 100 boxes in the American "Meiya" (boat name) currently docked at the pier that have not yet been unloaded, and it is said that there are also 300 boxes on the "Victoria," "President Cleveland," "Japanese Empress," and other ships that will be shipped to the Philippines for dumping one after another.

The Japanese are faking many kinds of Chinese national cloth. The main ones are: Juniman (red plain bottom), Wuyi (black plain bottom), Yiyigeluluo, Gedunya, Baiyi, printed fabric, and cheap Jiabu cloth. The Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Association's boycott subcommittee has now carefully studied the various fake Chinese cloth shipped to the Philippines. On the one hand, it is trying to crack down on counterfeit and inferior goods. On the other hand, it is protecting the genuine national goods produced by Chinese manufacturers, because most of the Chinese cotton textile factories in Shanghai are large factories with strong capital.

Chen Rongyu, the director of the boycott subcommittee of the Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Association, yesterday convened the Fuhe Cloth Merchants Association, the China Cloth Merchants Association, and overseas Chinese merchants from Houjiezai at the Anti-Japanese Association office to discuss countermeasures in order to prevent the dumping of "fake national cloth" in the Philippines. As a result of the discussion, effective measures will be taken to stop it.

### Reasons for High Rice Prices in Suzhou and Changzhou; Japanese Troops Prohibit the Shipment of Anhui Rice; Suzhou Rice Merchants Stop Transporting

Wuxi Correspondence: In recent days, rice prices in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other counties have soared. In Suzhou, the Japanese have stopped issuing transportation permits and are not allowed to transport rice to Shanghai. The day before yesterday, they detained 250 bags of rice transported to Shanghai by the Sanfeng Rice Store. Now, the rice merchants in Suzhou have obtained permits to transport 3,500 bags. In addition to the 1,315 bags that have already been transported to Shanghai, the remaining 17 carts, totaling 1,875 bags, have stopped being transported to Shanghai. The transportation permits have been returned to the puppet government. Rice merchants in Wuxi have tens of thousands of bags of rice purchased in Wuhu and Dangtu. The Japanese troops in Wuhu suddenly prohibited the shipment, and the payment had already been made. Even with the Changtu transportation permit obtained in exchange for the Wuxi purchase permit, it was still impossible to transport the rice to Wuxi, causing extreme panic in the Suzhou and Changzhou area. The market price suddenly became expensive.

### Grain Panic in Dinghai; Profiteers Hoarding and Speculating; Rice Prices Soar in the City

Dinghai Correspondence: In Dinghai, there are many steep mountains and few plains, so the agricultural output, except for ferns, is very small. The annual rice production is only enough for three months of food for the entire county's population. The poor people in the countryside even use fern silk instead of rice, which is a pitiful sight. Therefore, in previous years, the required grain was often imported from Wenzhou, Haidou, Ningbo, Wuhu, and other places. After Dinghai fell into enemy hands this summer, due to the special circumstances, the routes to Ningbo, Shanghai, Wenzhou, and Taizhou were all forced to suspend. Although fishing boats still operate from time to time, the import of foreign rice is ultimately difficult, so rice prices have soared from 16 yuan to 20 yuan. Although the new grain has been harvested in the fall, transportation between the city and the countryside is blocked. Hong Qiliang, who holds a position in the puppet self-government association, and a few rice merchants are taking the opportunity to hoard and speculate, deliberately raising prices in order to seek personal gain. The puppet association also imposes heavy taxes and levies, resulting in repeated exploitation, causing rice prices to rise to 24 or 25 yuan. The residents of the city are struggling to make a living and are constantly complaining. However, because the countryside is controlled by the Chinese army, rice prices are balanced, and the lives of the villagers are easier to maintain. Therefore, in recent days, city residents, unable to bear the pressure of life, have mostly moved to the countryside to live.

### Puppet Tobacco and Wine Bureau in Wuxi; Fierce Competition for Tax Revenue; A Full-Scale Brawl Erupts

Wuxi Correspondence: The Jiangsu puppet provincial government, in order to compete for the "tobacco and wine tax," has developed into a double-package case, and disputes have arisen repeatedly without resolution. A fight broke out again the other day over tax revenue. The reason was that a tobacco merchant, Yin Guangtai, transported 24 pieces of tobacco leaves from Anhui Province and reported the donation to the puppet Suzhou Provincial Tobacco and Wine Tax Bureau in Daochang Lane. Yuan Fuchang, Qiu Bowei, Wang Zhongfen, Ma Xiaozhou and others, the puppet bureau chiefs, went with the tobacco merchant to the Huangbudun tobacco boat mooring place to check the number of pieces and transport the tobacco leaves to Youshan Chuanbang for storage. There were also puppet police along the way for protection. Then, the Huangbudun Inspection Station of the Changxi District Puppet Stamp Tobacco and Wine Tax Bureau caught a glimpse of this, indicating that the tobacco leaves had not been taxed to the puppet bureau, so they detained the tobacco leaves and had a verbal argument with the puppet bureau staff, which led to a fight. Later, the tobacco boat moved closer to Beishuiguan and asked the puppet bureau staff to intercept it at Yingxiang Bridge, and another fight broke out. Both sides were injured. The tobacco boat was still detained by the Changxi District Puppet Bureau. All the participants in the fight who injured Wang Zhongfen, Ma Xiaozhou, Dong Longxing, etc., were sent to the puppet police station, but it was impossible to resolve the matter. It can be seen that the puppet parties in the occupied areas only know how to compete for profit.

### Shantou Youth Arrested; Six or Seven Hundred People Are Missing

Shantou Correspondence: After Shantou fell, the Chinese who did not escape in advance were ordered by the Japanese army to guarantee each other in groups of five. At this time, it was impossible to escape. In addition, the villages were counter-blockaded by the Chinese army, so that they suffered from the lack of rice, firewood, oil, salt, and other materials, and were bound by the lack of freedom of speech and action. They have almost exhausted their suffering. However, since November, the Japanese military police department at the Zhaoshang Road Dazhong Hotel in Shantou has been going to the busy streets in the city every day to hunt down young men. Dozens of people are arrested every day. As of now, six or seven hundred people have been arrested. At first, some people wanted to seek bail, but the Japanese army denied that they had caught anyone. However, it was heard that they were transported away in cages at night. One said they were going to Hainan Island or Taiwan for training and were being organized into puppet troops. Another said they were being transported to a certain island to work as miners. Their whereabouts are still unknown.

### Ministry of Education Improves Social Education Program (1) Phased Increase in People's Schools and Social Education Institutions; Continued Promotion of Literacy Education to Eliminate Illiteracy

(Special Telegram from Chongqing) During the Third National Education Conference this year, in addition to resolving to pass the "Proposal to the Ministry of Education to Establish the Current System of Social Education in China," "Establish a National Library System to Broaden Education," "Improve Art Education," "Improve the School System of Art Schools," (Drafting methods, please the Ministry of Education to plan and set up institutions for researching art and music at a high level), "Compile and promote wartime music classics to inspire the people and encourage morale," "Promote phonetic symbols," (Phonetic symbols are a powerful tool for eliminating illiteracy and popularizing Mandarin. Please the Ministry of Education to plan for funding and continue to promote them), "Please plan and set up large-scale science museums, libraries, and antiquities preservation centers in relatively safe areas in the northwest," "Students of wartime people's schools in various provinces should be given continuing education after graduation," "Please promote productive education for refugee children," and other cases, the Ministry of Education submitted a proposal to discuss the improvement of the social education program. It was revised and passed by the conference, and the full text is now being reviewed by the Ministry of Education and sent to the competent departments for execution. The full text of the program has now been located and excerpted below.

The implementation of social education should be based on the highest national construction principles and national policy guidelines, with the aim of improving the people's intelligence, enriching the people's strength, and completing the construction of politics, economy, and culture. In recent years, due to the objective needs of the social environment and the active promotion of the government and the people, social education has made considerable progress. However, the promotion and advancement still depend on future efforts. Therefore, based on the existing foundation and understanding of the needs of the environment, the following improvement methods are formulated:

(A) Phased Increase in People's Schools and Other Social Education Institutions

Zi: In densely populated counties and cities, each "bao" (unit of administrative division) should establish a people's school. In counties with a relatively sparse population and vast area, several "bao" may jointly establish a people's school. Starting from the 28th year (1939), the goal is to complete the establishment within three years, and the existing primary schools should be used as people's schools as much as possible.

Chou: Each county and city should establish a county-level or city-level people's education hall. The provincial education departments should determine the length of the preparation period based on the financial situation of each county and city. Starting from the 28th year (1939), all should be completed within three years. In counties with large populations and abundant funding, they should be increased year by year in rural areas, with the goal of establishing a people's education hall in each autonomous region.

Yin: Each province should divide people's education guidance areas according to the current administrative inspector districts, or geographical and transportation conditions. Each district should establish a provincial-level people's education hall. Starting from the 28th year (1939), the halls should be prepared and completed within three years.

Mao: Provinces and cities that have not established provincial-level or city-level libraries and gymnasiums should immediately begin preparing for the establishment of provincial-level libraries and gymnasiums.

Chen: Provincial-level or city-level museums, science museums, art museums, music theaters, etc., should be prepared and established in stages by each province, depending on its economic situation.

Yi: If each province needs to extend the completion deadline due to special circumstances, it must be submitted to the central management agency for approval.

(B) Continue to Promote Remedial Education for Adult Illiterates, Eliminate Illiteracy Across the Country, Promote National Consciousness, and Enhance the Strength of the War of Resistance

The large number of illiterates and the backwardness of the people's intelligence in our country are a hidden worry for the future of national rejuvenation. The Ministry of Education, starting in the autumn of the 25th year (1936), formulated and implemented the Outline of Measures for Remedial Education for Out-of-School People.

It was submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and approval, and the deadline for eliminating illiteracy across the country was set at six years. In the past two years, more than 20 million illiterates have been eliminated in various provinces and cities. In April of the 27th year (1938), in order to adapt to the needs of the War of Resistance and stimulate the national consciousness of the general public, the Ministry of Education specifically implemented wartime people's remedial education in Wuhan, mobilizing intellectuals and using administrative power to carry out large-scale promotion. The content of the education was literacy education and civic education, and the teaching period was shortened to two months. Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, Lanzhou and other cities are also conducting it separately, which is quite effective. In the future, it is urgent to actively promote it in various provinces and regions in order to achieve complete success. The methods are as follows:

Zi: Submit a request to the National Government to issue an order to mobilize intellectuals to carry out remedial education for out-of-school people, and implement a "education service" similar to "military service," forcing intellectuals to take on the work of eliminating illiteracy in order to achieve rapid results. The methods will be stipulated by the Ministry of Education.

Chou: The rear provinces should follow the Outline of Measures for Remedial Education for Out-of-School People and the detailed rules for implementation previously issued by the Ministry of Education, and actively promote remedial education for out-of-school people. The teaching period is four months, and the teaching materials are still the four volumes of textbooks for people's schools previously compiled by the Ministry of Education, with the addition of supplementary wartime materials.

Yin: The front provinces and the counties and cities along the main river and highway lines in the rear provinces should popularize wartime people's remedial education within one year, starting from the 28th year (1939).

Mao: People's schools should be attached to primary schools as much as possible, and the teachers should be concurrently served by primary school teachers.

Chen: For specially established people's schools, teachers can be publicly selected by educational administrative organs and given short-term training before taking office.

Yi: In addition to running adult classes and women's classes, wartime people's schools may also run children's classes, and the educational content may include civic training, conscription publicity, and literacy education, as well as production training and wartime service.

Wu: Each province's number of civil officials, number of people's schools established each year, amount of funding, number of teachers, number of students enrolled, and number of students graduated should all be compiled into detailed statistics and reported to the Ministry of Education.

Wei: The organization and promotion methods for implementing wartime people's remedial education can be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Guidelines for the Implementation of Wartime People's Remedial Education issued by the Ministry of Education.

### Ministry of Education Experiments with Card Literacy Education; Center Primary School Established First in Qingmuguan

(Special Telegram from Bishan) In order to develop primary education in Ba County and Qingmu Township in Bishan County, and to experiment with card literacy education methods, the Ministry of Education has first established a center primary school in Qingmuguan, which officially opened and started teaching at the end of September. Currently, there are 240 students and 22 faculty members in the primary school. Li Lianfang serves as the principal. This teaching method will be applied to all grades below the fourth grade. It is also planned to add or reorganize the primary schools in each "bao" of Qingmu Township. Investigation and planning have now begun, and it will be implemented in the next semester.

### Ministry of Education Investigates People's Education Halls in Various Provinces; Deadline for Reporting to the Ministry is the End of December

(Special Telegram from Chongqing) The Ministry of Education is currently striving to improve the work of people's education halls in various provinces. It is reported that an entire program has been formulated and will be announced soon. Now, in order to understand the actual situation of people's education halls in various places, the Ministry has specifically created a survey form on the general situation of people's education halls (divided into sections for hall name, address, organization, funding, and operations, with special emphasis on the description of central work), and has ordered the education departments of various provinces to investigate and report to the Ministry by the end of December of this year.

### Instructors’ Refresher Course at Secondary Schools in Shensi Province Opened in November

(Special Dispatch from Kunming) The Yunnan Provincial Department of Education and the National Southwestern Associated University jointly sponsored a refresher course for employed faculty in secondary schools in Yunnan Province.

Upon graduation, they all return to their original schools to serve. The course offers four subjects: Chinese language, history, geography, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and the period of study is one year. The course graduates completed the admission procedures from November 6 to 10 and have now begun classes.

### Six Provisional Middle Schools to be Established in Zhejiang Province, to Open Next Spring

(Lishui Correspondence) The first Zhejiang Provincial Assembly concluded its session a few days ago. Considering the increasing number of students in western Zhejiang who have been deprived of education for years, Zhu Zhonghua and others, in order to provide relief to these out-of-school youths, specially proposed that the Ministry of Education establish sufficient national and provincial provisional middle schools in Zhejiang Province. The proposal has been approved. It is heard that the plan proposed by Zhu and others is to establish six provisional middle schools in the six prefectures of Ningbo, Shaoxing, Taizhou, Jinhua, Quzhou, and Yanzhou in eastern Zhejiang, where the national army is stationed, so as to accommodate as many out-of-school youths from western Zhejiang as possible. It is now reported that the assembly will begin operations in the spring of next year.

### Luo Douwen Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong; East China's Chen Ronghuan is Completely Renewed; Will Help Chen Fight Dong Se Lai Tomorrow

The famous football player Luo Douwen was formerly a familiar face in the Shanghai football scene. Since going to Hong Kong last year to play for South China, his reputation has increased tenfold. Luo recently requested leave to return north and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. As East China is experiencing a decline in its star players, they invited Luo to help out, which he has agreed to. In tomorrow's match against Dong Se Lai, Luo will play as the left winger. After three days of absence, he should be viewed with new eyes. Luo has fought in Southern China and has also followed South China to the Philippines. His experience and skills have both improved.

### The Allied Powers Unanimously Assist China to Strive for Final Victory; British Ambassador Declares No Negotiations Have Taken Place; Japan's Attempts to Release Diplomatic Smoke Screens Have All Failed

Since the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing on the 15th of last month, there have been various speculations from the outside world, saying that Kerr's visit was to discuss the China issue with the Japanese authorities. However, these are merely speculations. Yesterday, a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency visited authoritative foreign diplomatic circles and observers closely watching the Far East situation in this area, and it has been confirmed that what can fully dispel the doubts is the clear statement made by the British Ambassador. According to Kerr, "I have not recently conducted any important discussions with representatives of third countries in China." The British Ambassador's statement was confirmed by diplomatic circles here yesterday. At the same time, diplomatic circles pointed out that the key to the future relationship between third countries and Japan regarding China is largely tied to Washington.

All Rumors Denied by Britain

It is noted that in the past week, there have been several rumors from the Japanese side, which have caused deep attention and concern in diplomatic circles. One rumor is that Ambassador Kerr has already, or is about to, discuss a wide range of important issues with the Japanese authorities. Foreigners here believe that if such a meeting were to be held, it would be deeply regrettable, because Britain, having its own affairs in Europe, may temporarily abandon its interests in China. However, there is no sign of this to be found. It is reported in Tokyo that Britain is willing to hand over the Chinese silver stored in the British Concession in Tianjin in exchange for Japan lifting the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. However, this rumor has been immediately denied by the British authorities here. Before this incident occurred, Japanese newspapers made a great fuss about the Japanese special envoy Kato's courteous visit to Ambassador Kerr, but it was quickly officially stated by both Britain and Japan that no important issues were discussed.

Japan Releases Diplomatic Smoke Screen

Commentators here pointed out that Japanese newspapers usually exaggerate the development of Japanese diplomacy, but this time, the attention given to the British and Japanese ambassadors is noteworthy, but upon closer inspection, it is not worth laughing at. This is because Japanese newspapers and some pro-Japanese Chinese tabloids reported last week that the British, French, and Japanese envoys would meet in Beiping to discuss the meaning of the United States putting pressure on Japan and the strength and methods to deal with it. Yesterday, reporters listened to the opinions of American and other foreign business circles here, and all believed that what the Japanese side had done in the past two weeks was merely to release a diplomatic smoke screen, because the recent expressions of pressure from the United States, both from the government and the public, against Japan's infringement of the rights and interests of third countries in the occupied areas of China have developed rapidly. Therefore, the Japanese side spread rumors to confuse the public.

Japanese Soldiers Will Not Withdraw, and the War of Resistance Will Continue to the End

Last week, a foreign observer returned to Shanghai from Chongqing and described his feelings, saying that all in Chongqing believe that unless China's position is realized, any "peace" conditions cannot be accepted by China. The observer also said that the great victory in the Xiangbei battle has further consolidated China's political unity and further strengthened Chairman Chiang's statement that "as long as Japanese soldiers are in China for one day, China will resist for one day." Therefore, the British and French policies towards China have not changed unexpectedly after the outbreak of the European war. Moreover, even if they wanted to interfere in China at this time, it would not be possible.

The Allied Powers Unanimously Condemn Japan

Authoritative figures in foreign diplomatic circles here all expressed yesterday that they believe that the Allied countries, in addition to fully supporting China in accordance with their consistent policy, are certain that this attitude is correct and unshakable, as can be proved by the repeated statements made by Washington against Japan and the opinions expressed by the majority of American newspapers and magazines. American public opinion and policy are not only caused by the famous "hundreds of protests" being delayed by Japan, but also because of the general commercial status of third countries in the occupied areas of China. However, diplomatic circles here pointed out that due to the unanimous condemnation of Japan by the Allied Powers, and the encouragement of the United States to put pressure on Japan, forcing Japan to approach the Soviet Union would result in even greater losses for third countries, which is actually an unnecessary "anxiety."

### The Second Batch of Fractional Currency Notes Is Scheduled to Be Issued on the 8th, Which Will Be Distributed Gradually According to Market Needs; The Auxiliary Currency Notes in Stock Have Also Been Exchanged as Much as Possible

In order to alleviate the shortage panic of auxiliary currency notes in the Shanghai market, the four banks of China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Farmers have agreed on temporary remedies. The banks have exchanged and issued as many new and old auxiliary currency notes as possible. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has also rushed to print one-cent, five-cent, and cent currency notes to replace the use of auxiliary currency notes. It has now been decided to issue them starting from the 8th, adopting a gradual issuance system. The details are recorded as follows:

Auxiliary Currency Notes in Stock Are Exchanged as Much as Possible

The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has already completed the exchange of 3.5 million yuan of new auxiliary currency notes in stock, and has reissued the previously recovered 25-cent notes. The Chinese Farmers Bank has issued as many 50-cent notes in stock as possible, until they are all issued. The Zhejiang Local Bank and the Jiangsu Farmers Bank have sorted out the old auxiliary currency notes that were previously recovered, and reissued the complete notes to facilitate circulation and eliminate the past panic of shortage. Therefore, the panic of shortage of auxiliary currency notes in the Shanghai market is gradually being resolved. In recent days, those who have exchanged currency notes from various banks due to legitimate needs have been very crowded.

The Second Batch of Fractional Currency Notes Is Scheduled to Be Issued

In order to fundamentally alleviate the shortage of auxiliary currency notes, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank telegraphed the head office to entrust the American merchant Yongning Company to print a large number of one-cent, five-cent, and cent currency notes, with the five-cent notes being the best. The head office has approved this and signed a printing contract with Yongning Company. The printed fractional currency notes will be delivered to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank at any time. The bank has recently decided to start issuing them on the 8th of this month (Friday), adopting a gradual issuance system according to market needs, and using five-cent notes to replace the use of auxiliary currency notes. It is heard that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank is ready for the issuance of fractional currency notes.

Exchange Methods Have Been Stipulated

Regarding the issuance methods of fractional currency notes, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank that if member banks of the Shanghai financial industry banking association and the Huichang Money Shop of the Money Shop Association, as well as major companies and major stores, have a legitimate need for fractional currency notes due to business, they can exchange them at the Central Bank. The bank will review and, if it deems them qualified, provide them as much as possible. It is also stipulated that those who receive fractional currency notes must not hoard them for profit. It has been decided to temporarily stop supplying small money shops and cigarette exchange shops this time, because it has been reported that some small money shops and cigarette exchange shops deliberately hoarded them for speculation.

Be Careful Not to Hoard, Which Will Affect People's Livelihood

A reporter from the New Sound News Agency also learned from banking circles that the number of auxiliary currency notes issued by various banks in Shanghai circulating in the market is quite large. In terms of nickel-copper auxiliary currency, there are a total of 27,466,180.8 yuan. On today's Shanghai market, they are almost completely absent. Therefore, the four banks of China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Farmers do not know the reason for today's sudden shortage. Therefore, it is obvious that someone is taking advantage of the environment to manipulate and profit. The four banks have now agreed on fundamental remedies, so the severity of the shortage panic can be completely eliminated. However, it is hoped that all sectors will be careful not to hoard for profit in the future, so as not to affect the livelihood of the people of Shanghai.

Soviet Union Continues to Assist China

Observers believe that the Soviet Union is unwilling to assist Japan in its "holy war" in China unless Japan can pay a staggering price. Moreover, even if Japan recognizes the Soviet Union's huge demands, the Soviet Union's assistance and encouragement to the Chinese National Government will continue unabated. At this time, Japan is fluctuating between accepting American demands and begging for Soviet support, and its army is distributed across a historically unprecedented vast front. The domestic economy is also in a dire situation due to the actions of the navy and army. Therefore, based on these arguments, a leader-observer from a third country concluded to the Da Zhong News Agency yesterday that Japan's current situation is indeed in the worst possible state. Therefore, neither Britain nor France is willing to cooperate with Japan at this time. As for the efforts made by the United States today, it is undoubtedly in a proactive position.

### Provinces, Cities, and Counties Enthusiastically Promote National Construction Savings; Post Office Completes the Procedures for Issuing Coupons

In order to encourage national savings and build national construction undertakings, the National Government has designated various banks to conduct national construction savings and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to issue thrift national construction savings coupons. Provinces, cities, and counties across the country have unanimously promoted this. The central government, considering that this is a major plan for national construction, has established a National Thrift National Construction Savings Movement Committee to coordinate and promote the effort. Currently, important cities in Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces have decided to establish branches. More than 1,000 post offices across the country have also completed the procedures for issuing national construction savings coupons by the end of last month. Party and government organs in various places have unanimously coordinated publicity. Inspired by patriotic enthusiasm, the people have enthusiastically participated in thrift savings to assist the country's national construction undertakings.

### Rice Prices Are Expected to Break Free from Japanese Shackles; Tribute Rice Arrived Again Yesterday, Price Per Bag is Approximately 30 Yuan; Foreign Newspapers Observe the Soaring Rice Prices

The Shanghai rice situation will tend to stabilize, with national rice and tribute rice pouring into the port. More than 20,000 bags of tribute rice transported from Hong Kong arrived yesterday and entered the warehouse yesterday morning to wait for customers. The total cost is relatively low, with each bag weighing 189 pounds, only about 30 yuan in national currency. It is heard that rice industry firms in this city are in contact for the third purchase and will transport it to Shanghai for storage, so that profiteers will run out of tricks and be exhausted, and can break free from Japanese shackles. After the Shanghai Market Management Committee strictly monitors the buying and selling of rice market tea parties by the same industry and enforces market rules to maintain order, the price of japonica and indica rice has begun to fall since the day before yesterday. The 5 million citizens of Shanghai are paying close attention to the trend of the nearby rice market. In addition to hoping that the authorities will thoroughly investigate the rumor-mongering rice weevils and strictly implement price limits, they also hope that the person in charge of the rice market will step up efforts to stabilize people's hearts so that market prices will fall step by step.

Foreign Newspapers' Views Blame the Japanese

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post sees high prices. Chinese newspapers now strongly condemn the manipulators in the market here. However, according to a closer investigation, it does not seem to be blamed on the manipulators, because this situation is caused by the Japanese. A certain morning newspaper uses the phrase "official non-interference," indicating that the Municipal Council has no action in this situation. However, according to investigations, what the Municipal Council can do is very little. Chinese newspapers convey the methods adopted by Chinese business groups, such as "requesting rice market buyers, sellers, and brokers to consider the lives of the poor and warning them not to be selfish and disrupt peace and order," etc., which have no impact on the rice market. The soaring rice prices in Shanghai are by no means due to hoarding by Chinese merchants, but can be completely attributed to the Japanese. This is the conclusion reached by reporters investigating the rice situation.

Although the Exchange Rate is Low, Tribute Rice is Still Cheap

A reporter heard a gentleman say that the current situation is extremely embarrassing. Although the exchange rate is low, Saigon rice is still slightly cheaper than national rice. What else can be said? Although this year's rice production in the Yangtze River Basin is not as much as it would be in a normal political situation, it is still considered a bumper harvest. After the new rice hits the market in September, there will be enough rice to supply Shanghai for six to eight months, until it is exhausted in April, May, and June next year. However, this rice has not been transported to the Shanghai market. There are several reasons for this, which can be summarized as being due to the Japanese army in China.

Reasons for the Lack of Japanese Rice Production

This year, Japanese rice production is 14% lower, for the reasons of (1) abnormal weather, (2) many farmers who should be engaged in farming have joined the army, (3) farm women are now working in munitions factories. In the past, when Japan had a poor harvest, it was always 12% lower than usual. This year, it is doubled. In the past, when Japan had a poor harvest, it relied on Korea. However, Korea also had a poor harvest this year, and cannot be expected to provide assistance. As a result, Japan has only one thing to do, which is to print a large number of paper money, calling it "Yen," "Huaxing Piao," or any other name, which is carried by the Japanese army to the vast rice-producing areas between Taihu Lake and Poyang Lake, in order to solve Japan's rice shortage. The Japanese soldiers holding guns and bayonets and holding paper "currency" implement this treacherous plan. Those who need rice are not only Japan itself, but also the million Japanese soldiers on the Chinese battlefield need it, and the followers of the Japanese army also take from it. Therefore, what the Japanese army eats is not only the rice of a million people.

Extortion of Taxes and Difficult Transportation

The remaining rice is transported to the Shanghai Concession and other places after all kinds of difficulties and the "taxes" of the Japanese puppets. The price of rice in the interior is currently 18 to 20 yuan per stone. After being squeezed along the way, it rises to 35 yuan when it arrives in Shanghai. The reduction in weight during transportation, plus the small profits sought by the sellers, brings the rice price to around 40 yuan. Although the exchange rate is low for rice imported from Saigon, and transportation costs are added, it is still slightly lower than the figure of 40 yuan. The average Chinese person eats two pounds of rice per day. A family of three consumes six pounds of rice per day, which costs 40 yuan per month. However, the average Chinese income is only about 35 yuan per month.

### New Dispute at the Lun Chang Old Factory is Trending Towards Resolution; Workers Are Unwilling to Be Exploited Again; Full Resumption of Work Expected Within Days

After the resolution of the labor unrest at the British Lun Chang Textile Factory new factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, workers have successively resumed work, and there is no problem. However, workers at the Lun Chang Old Factory in Bailianjing raised a new wave of dispute because they pointed out that the terms of this resolution were not as favorable as when labor and management directly negotiated at the beginning. They also blocked workers living in Puxi from going to work. According to investigations, most workers do not want to be exploited again after a long period of work stoppage and living in hardship. Therefore, on the day of resumption of work, some of those who were prevented from going to work are continuing to enter the factory. Although they do not account for the vast majority, it is believed that within a few days, they will all resume work. Therefore, the new dispute will be resolved invisibly.

### Eggs from Inland China Are Still Controlled by the Japanese

The French-language Shanghai Daily reported on the 30th that "for some time, the Japanese merchant Mitsui Company has been detaining the eggs purchased by various foreign merchants when they are transported to Shanghai, which has caused protests from all sides. Afterwards, the eggs were returned to their original owners. Now, the Japanese authorities have stated that in principle, the egg market has been restored to freedom, but there should be some 'procedures'." However, the so-called "procedures" almost prevent foreign merchants from exporting eggs from the market. In fact, before foreign merchants purchase eggs in the inland, they must pay a fee of two yen per basket to the Japanese Chamber of Commerce to obtain a license. In fact, this chamber of commerce is indeed an alias for Mitsui Company. When obtaining the license, foreign merchants must sell 50% of their eggs to Mitsui Company, and the price is determined by Mitsui itself. However, this price is always lower than the price of inland eggs.

### Banks and Money Shops Prepare for Annual Closing; Office As Usual on December 30; Money Shops Also Close Accounts at the End of the Lunar Year

The end of the fiscal year of the Republic of China in 1928 is approaching, and member banks and money shops of the Bank and Money Shop Association have begun to prepare. However, the closing date of December 31st happens to be a Sunday holiday. The banks and money shops have decided internally to work as usual on that day and will announce the implementation after the two associations have passed it. They have also set a three-day holiday from New Year's Day next year and will open for business on the 4th. As for the closing of accounts for money shops, it is usually at the end of the lunar year (i.e., February 7th). However, this year, in addition to closing accounts at the end of the lunar year, they will also close annual accounts at the end of the national calendar. The reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned yesterday from the banks and money shops that the financial market in Shanghai is stable and unchanged due to the lending of the four banks of China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Farmers and the adjustment of the treasury by the banks and money shops. There is no sign of tight money, so there is no problem in all industries safely passing the end of the fiscal year.

### Jianghai Customs Employees Receive Allowances

Customs employees had previously requested the authorities to increase allowances due to the increased cost of living in Shanghai. It is now learned that this request has been approved by the authorities. The method is that starting from October, (1) each person will receive an additional allowance of 15 yuan per month, (2) the allowances for October, November, December, and three months will be issued together at the end of December, and starting from January next year, they will be issued monthly.

### Chongde Post Office in Zhejiang Resumes Operations; Shanghai Post Office Notifies Postal Shipments

The Chongde Post Office in Zhejiang was evacuated after the war, and postal transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang was somewhat stagnant. Through the efforts of the Shanghai Post Office authorities and the Zhejiang Administration, they have been restored one after another. It is learned that the Chongde Post Office has now resumed operations. The Shanghai Post Office has resumed accepting all types of mail to the Chongde Post Office and will hand them over to the Chang'an Post Office in Zhejiang for delivery.

### Strengthening Defenses in Western Shanghai by British Troops: Repairing Wire Mesh Fences on Route Doumer

In the areas beyond the Shanghai International Settlement roads in western Shanghai, bordering the Chinese-administered territories, during the Shanghai war, the Settlement authorities erected wooden posts along the roads, surrounded them with wire mesh fences to block traffic, and constructed defensive works at several key locations to maintain security within the Settlement. Unexpectedly, after the Japanese puppet troops and police invaded the area beyond the Settlement roads, they gradually damaged or dismantled the installed wire mesh fences in various places without the consent of the Settlement authorities. Consequently, criminals were able to emerge and cause disturbances to the peace. As the Settlement began to implement winter defenses, the British garrison troops in the area have been carrying large quantities of wire mesh fences and wooden posts for days, actively repairing wire mesh fences on Route Doumer, parallel to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, from Route Andre Cohen to Route Koukouchow. The work is expected to be completed soon to strengthen defenses.

### Japanese Newspapers: Reporting Severely Restricted, Shrouded in the Darkness of Censorship, News Reports Deliberately Distorting Facts

The Continental Daily News reports that Mr. Gault, who recently returned to Shanghai from Japan, wrote an article published in this week's China Critic, stating that although much of the news published in Shanghai is propaganda, it is reported very clearly. However, Japanese newspapers are shrouded in the darkness of censorship. Japanese newspapers deliberately distort facts in their reports on current events, regardless of whether they are related to the war situation in China or the trends of Japanese interests in remote corners of the world. Recent events such as the abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty and the Soviet-German Treaty show that the development of international news is completely unexpected by the Japanese people. Currently, Japanese newspapers are used as a tool to comfort the people rather than to educate them. Therefore, the setbacks suffered by Japanese foreign policy have not caused excessive anxiety among the public.

### Shortening Shanghai-Ningbo Voyage Time: Still No Definite News, Rumors of Implementation Today are Speculative

Although the change of mooring outside the mouth of the Zhenhai port after it was blocked has caused a lot of inconvenience for the loading and unloading of goods and passengers on the Shanghai-Ningbo route ships, business is still thriving. However, due to waiting for loading and unloading at the mouth of Zhenhai port, shipping schedules have been delayed, causing huge losses to shipping companies. They have repeatedly tried to shorten the voyage time, but have been unable to do so due to various reasons. Recently, it has been repeatedly reported that the Moufu, Deping, Haifu, and Hana ships were designated for annual repairs in dock. After the repairs of Shililai were completed, it test sailed to Wenzhou the day before yesterday. Moufu and Feikang are still in Zhenhai waiting to load and unload goods. The Hana ship went to Ningbo on the 24th. After passengers disembarked, it sailed to Songmen to unload goods. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from the ship, saying that it could return to Shanghai from Songmen tonight, and it is estimated that it will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon. The next shift will continue to sail to Zhenhai, combining Wan and Song, but the designation of Tian ships to carry passengers and shorten shipping schedules are all hypothetical.

### Chinese Troops on Shanghai-Hangzhou Line Attacking Jinshanwei: Zhapu Recaptured, Large Army Gathered, Rumors of Fierce Battle in Hangzhou Bay

It is rumored that a unit of a certain independent brigade of the Chinese regular army has occupied the strongholds on the Shanghai-Hangzhou road. Therefore, traffic on the highway from Shanghai to Jinshan and other coastal areas has been cut off. This regular army, with distinct uniforms, and the reorganized 8th Detachment of the Zhongyi Salvation Army of guerrillas, have made contact with the invading Japanese army. Two Japanese army speedboats were destroyed, and more than 30 people were killed. Many puppet troops along the line have defected. After Jinshanwei was occupied by the Japanese army, it opened up an airport and wharf, which is equivalent to a military port and an air force base. Recently, since Zhapu was recaptured, a large army has gathered in Hangzhou Bay, and Jinshanwei is in imminent danger. The Chinese army will make every effort to capture it and destroy it to prevent its use.

### Shanghai Residents Going to Ningbo Can Return to Shanghai with Certification

The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association, regarding whether Shanghai residents can still obtain export permits from the Yin County government with the Association's certificate after going to Ningbo, has now received a reply telegram from Zhou Dalie, Chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, stating, "To the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association: The telegram is acknowledged. For those exporting labor, if their place of residence is indeed in Shanghai, and certified by your Association, they can obtain export permits from the County government, and must provide shop guarantee: (1) Guarantee that the place of residence is authentic; (2) Guarantee that the recruits will return to their hometown for military service when slightly adjusted. This is the reply. Zhou Dalie."

### Scots Celebrate National Day: Offering Flowers at the Peace Statue, Communion Service Held in Church

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that the Scottish community in Shanghai today (30th) commemorates St. Andrew's Day (Scottish National Day). At 8:30 a.m., Mr. Long Lock, President of the St. Andrew's Society of Shanghai, led the Scottish expatriates to offer wreaths at the Peace Statue on the Bund. After all the wreaths were placed under the statue, there was a minute of silence. At 10:30 a.m., a special communion service was held at the Community Church of Shanghai to commemorate St. Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland. At noon, the St. Andrew's Day horse races were held at the Race Club. British soldiers from the Seaforth Highlanders were present to play the bagpipes and famous tunes. The golf tournament between the St. Andrew's Society and the Royal Society of St. George is scheduled for Sunday, but the grand dance party held on that day in previous years has been cancelled this year due to the European War.

### Six Percent British Gold Loan Lottery Today: 4 p.m. at Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, Yu Ping Paid by Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Bank of Shanghai

### Moral Re-Armament Broadcast: A Ray of Hope in the World Crisis

— A Lecture by Dr. Buchman

At 7:30 last night, the Moral Re-Armament movement in this city broadcast on the Gospel Radio Station, featuring a speech by Dr. Frank Buchman, the founder of the Moral Re-Armament movement, entitled "A Ray of Hope in the World Crisis," read by Dr. Ferguson of Renji Hospital. This speech was first broadcast in Boston and San Francisco in the United States, and then the Dutch radio station also broadcast this speech to Java. The United Kingdom can also listen to it at the same time, and the New York radio station also broadcast it a month ago. The broadcasting time was originally set for 45 minutes, but it was extended by 8 minutes due to insufficient time, breaking the record of the New York radio station, which shows the importance of this speech. Now, the main points of its content are recorded below:

Focus on Character

"In today's world, the flames of war are growing, and human culture is on the verge of bankruptcy. At this critical time, we urgently need a new philosophy to rebuild the world and restore the principles of purity, unselfishness, love, and four kinds of loyalty. This is the standard of the Moral Re-Armament movement.

### Case of Embezzling Huge Sums of US Dollars: Waiting for a Telegram from Tianjin for Verification, Xu Xinmin Redeemed Prostitute Rong Ruizhen: Both Fled to Shanghai and Were Intercepted at the Pier: Stole a Total of 43,000 US Dollars

The French Concession Police received a telegram from the Police Department of the Tianjin French Concession the day before yesterday, stating that a clerk from a commercial bank in the Tianjin French Concession embezzled a huge sum of US dollars and took the Taikoo Company's Hubei ship to Shanghai, requesting them to send personnel to intercept him. The French Police sent detectives to wait at the pier and caught a male and a female suspect, and seized the stolen money. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Xu Xinmin, also known as Yi Qin, from Yantai, is the deputy director of the business department of the Banque de l'Indochine in the Tianjin French Concession. He is 30 years old this year. Usually, he is generous and active in social circles. He met Rong Ruizhen, a prostitute at the Six Nations Hotel on the third floor of Tianjin, and set a price of more than 3,000 taels of gold. However, Xu did not have this huge sum of money at the time, and he was unwilling to break his promise to Rong. Thus, he came up with a plan to steal and embezzle funds and flee. He managed to open the bank's safe and steal 43,000 US dollars (equivalent to more than 500,000 Chinese legal tender). He went to the Six Nations Hotel to complete the redemption procedures for the prostitute Rong, and then took her to Shanghai. After the bank discovered the incident, they investigated the stolen money and reported it to the Tianjin French Police Department, requesting an investigation. After finding out that Xu had taken the prostitute Rong and boarded the Taikoo Company's Hubei ship to Shanghai, they urgently sent a telegram to notify Shanghai. After receiving the report, the French Police sent Detective Wang Ronggui and Inspector Xie Guangming, along with detectives, to wait at Taikoo Pier No. 3 at 1 p.m. the day before yesterday.

As a result, Xu and the prostitute Rong were arrested in the official cabin room, and more than 39,000 US dollars were found in their luggage suitcases. As for the rest of the money, Xu said that it had been spent on the prostitute Rong's redemption and travel expenses. The detectives then took Xu, the prostitute Rong, and their luggage back to the police station, waiting for a telegram from the Tianjin French Police Department for verification and further processing. It is also heard that the prostitute Rong's mother also took the money to redeem her daughter by taking the train to Shanghai, so the police also sent detectives to wait at the pier to arrest her.

### Contract Violation and Embezzlement Case: Cao Wenyu's Appeal Rejected, Still Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment

In a lawsuit using audio recording as evidence, Cao Wenyu, an employee of a Japanese company, revealed the truth of the crime in a phone call. As a result of being secretly recorded by his cousin Cai Xiaoti, Cao lost both trials. This is a new invention using scientific evidence. The details of the case are as follows: Cao Wenyu, a Pudong native and employee of the Japanese-owned Huili Company, is 30 years old this year. In the spring of last year, he acted on the instructions of his employer and sold 20,000 bags of wheat from the Huili Company in his own name. At that time, Cao signed a contract with the buyer Cai Xiaoti (who is Cao's cousin). Unexpectedly, after Cai paid the deposit, Cao violated the contract and failed to deliver the goods, causing Cai to suffer considerable losses. In May of this year, Cai hired lawyer Xu Jinyu to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Cao of violating the contract and requesting a judgment for compensation for the losses and return of the deposit, totaling more than 12,000 yuan. When the court summoned Cao, Cao suddenly presented a fabricated settlement agreement, claiming that the previously signed wheat sales contract had been canceled. Cai argued that the fabricated settlement agreement had not been signed by him, had no witnesses, and the seal was stolen. However, he could not prove that the seal was stolen. Cai then commissioned an audio recording company to make an audio recording. When Cai spoke with Cao on the phone, Cao admitted to stealing a seal and said that he had no choice. The conversation between the two parties was made into a record by the audio recording company. Afterwards, Cai hired lawyer Xu Jinyu to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Cao of forgery.

After reviewing the case, the High Court opened a hearing and played the record in court. The presiding judge and the judges believed that Cao's true nature of the crime was revealed in the record. Therefore, they announced the conclusion of the hearing. Yesterday, Chen Daqi, acting presiding judge, took his seat in the Second Criminal Division and announced the verdict, rejecting the appeal. Cao Wenyu was still sentenced to six months in prison.

### Finance - Hong Kong Telegraph Rises, Absorbing Large Quantities - Gold Price Rises Fiercely in the Afternoon - Informal Trading Reaches 3940 Yuan - Active Trading of 2500 Taels

Yesterday's informal trading of spot gold saw normal fluctuations in the morning session. As there were few reports of changes in foreign exchange rates, although a certain money exchange house from Hong Kong entrusted someone to buy in, a certain gold firm released short positions on behalf of speculative traders. Furthermore, silver shops and retail investors were also selling, resulting in a near balance of positions. Afterwards, although foreign exchange rates were extremely tight, the gold price rose sharply, breaking through the 3900 yuan barrier. This was due to reports of rising gold prices in Hong Kong, prompting Hong Kong firms to purchase large quantities without limit, and settling at a foreign exchange rate that was approximately 600 yuan lower. This attracted many retail investors and financial institutions to buy in, leading to a further increase in the closing price. The situation on that day saw unremarkable fluctuations in the morning, only around 11 yuan, ultimately hovering around 3870 yuan until the afternoon closing. The price was initially firm in the afternoon, but after 2:30 PM, the exchange rate softened, and Hong Kong firms continued to purchase. Although there was a slight dip in the middle, it was difficult to stop the final upward trend, rising to 3925 yuan. The closing price reached the highest point of the day, a significant increase of 59 yuan compared to the previous day. Buying momentum did not decrease after the close, with gold firms absorbing the most, at a price around 3940 yuan. Trading was active throughout the day, totaling 2500 taels.

Securities firms bought 20 taels from silver shops, and money exchange houses did 10 taels among themselves, all at 3874 yuan. Subsequently, as the exchange market remained stable, sentiment slightly weakened, and silver shops and retail gold firms sold to each other. The price soon fell back by 7 yuan, with a silver shop selling 30 taels to a money exchange house at 3867 yuan. Afterwards, as Hong Kong firms initiated purchases, entrusting a certain money exchange house to buy on their behalf, the price was pulled up by 10 yuan. The money exchange house and a spot gold firm jointly bought 30 taels from silver shops and money exchange houses at 3877 yuan. After that, buying stopped. At that time, the foreign exchange rate was slightly firmer, and short sellers from securities firms came to sell, causing a small rebound of 11 yuan.

A certain money exchange house bought 30 taels from silver shops at 3872 yuan. Then, money exchange houses did 20 taels among themselves at 3870 yuan, setting the noon closing price.

Other firms bought 20 taels from securities firms at 12,910 yuan. After that, the buying momentum subsided slightly, and those with floating profits sold, briefly falling back inside the 3900 yuan barrier, to 3886 yuan. At that time, news of rising gold prices in Hong Kong was heard, and buying momentum was revived. A certain money exchange house and a certain gold firm came to compete to absorb the gold again, and securities firms also came to cover their short positions, raising the price by another 39 yuan. Securities firms bought 20 taels from silver shops at 3925 yuan. After that, money exchange houses took profits, falling back by 7 yuan. A money exchange house sold 10 taels to a gold firm at 3918 yuan. Later, securities firms and gold firms bought in again, raising the price by another 7 yuan.

Afterwards, a money exchange house sold American dollar bills to a certain bank at 7.9375, followed by Hong Kong telegraph releasing a total of US$200,000 in favorable American exchange to China and Belgium certain bank at 7.875. Therefore, the process was stable. Subsequently, transactions suddenly became rare and unusually sluggish, and the situation remained stagnant until the noon closing. The bank's spot selling price for British gold was 4/8.28125, and for American exchange it was 7.84375, which was 0.015625 looser for British and 0.03125 firmer for American compared to the morning opening.

Chinese Banks Buy Forward American Exchange

The situation in the afternoon remained quiet, but the underlying trend was slightly softening due to Chinese banks buying forward American exchange. Chinese banks settled December American exchange with Datong certain bank at 7.75. There were very few reports of spot market activity. By the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price for British gold was 4/8.125, and for American exchange it was 7.8125. December British gold was 4/7.65625, and December American exchange was 7.71875. As a result, spot prices were 0.015625 tighter for British and 0.03125 softer for American compared to the previous day. There was no difference in futures prices.

Shanghai exchange decreased by 2 yuan, to 113 yuan. "Joint Notes" informal market continued to depreciate by 1 yuan, to 91 yuan.

### Securities Market Vague

Yesterday's informal securities market situation saw a decrease in fatigue but an increase in stagnation. People were restless and did not know what to do. However, there were certainly many future changes, and both bullish and bearish factors were being speculated on by all parties. The current situation seemed to favor bullish positions because the eighth repayment of principal and interest was approaching, and people were inevitably anxious. The morning's trading saw extremely rare transactions due to the large number of onlookers, and the market price was extremely stagnant. In the afternoon, there were initial purchases of the 20th, and then Tongkang covered their short positions, slightly improving the market by 0.1-0.2. Then, there were more sales of the 64th, and the market decreased again, and the situation became increasingly erratic. As a result, the three types of Jia, Ding, and Wu were completely unchanged, and the two types of Bing and Yi decreased slightly by 0.05 or 0.15. The total number of transactions was around 500,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below:

Stock Transactions: 50 shares of Great China Match Company were transacted at a price of 18 yuan each.

Yesterday, the stock market of the Public Industry Association still saw little change, and there were few transactions. The steel stock was uniquely firm and expensive, and the rest were mediocre. The trend of rubber stocks was stable.

London, 29th: Today's listed market price of Chinese foreign debt remained stable, and there were no changes in any of the bonds. London, 29th: Today's listed market price of stocks of British Far East companies saw a slight increase. Shanghai Tram stock rose by 6 pence, to a price of 13 shillings. Shanghai Waterworks A stock rose by 1 pound, to a price of 12 pounds. Klark Lim rubber stock continued to rise by 11 pence, to a price of 21 shillings and 6 pence. The rest were stable.

### Grain - Manipulative Forces Control the Shanghai Rice Market - Rice Prices Had Already Decreased Slightly in the Morning - Hoarding by Banks Drives Prices Up Again

In recent times, the rice market has been rising and falling, seemingly unpredictable, but ultimately fluctuating only within one or two yuan. A high is immediately followed by a low, a rotating cycle, which can be called a spiraling situation. Initially, yesterday's market saw the trend weaken due to the lingering effects of the previous day, but after the price was reduced, it tightened again. Therefore, the closing price did not see much fluctuation. The general brokers in the morning, in a market that constantly changed and was difficult to grasp, adopted a conservative approach after seeing the market turn soft, and did not dare to make rash moves. The brokers' psychology was influenced by the fact that those who had held on at high prices had a lot of inventory, and they knew that the rumors were inaccurate and the supply was continuous. Thirty or more cars of goods from the Suzhou-Jiaxing area arrived at the port, and large quantities of foreign rice, constantly arriving in Shanghai, were always counted in the tens of thousands. Those with decisions in transit were also arriving one after another, and they were deeply afraid of being controlled by them, which would be irreversible. Due to these reasons, they decided to sell early. Moreover, the market was fatigued, and there were few inquiries. The large number of foreign rice in the hands of the Beiyang group was unique, and they frequently sold it at low prices. For example, Saigon rice was as low as 33 yuan, and the heart was even more anxious, so they gradually lowered the price and uniformly released it, so the sales market became more sluggish. By midday, all goods had fallen by more than one yuan. As for the general hoarders and speculators, who wanted to take the opportunity to rebuild their foundations, they saw the price decreasing all the way and thought the time was right to buy in cheaply, unleashed their manipulative forces, and greatly controlled the market. In an instant, the situation became tight again and stirred up excitement, and the local shopkeepers, who had been watching for a long time, also took action and followed suit. The sales market was lively, and the market price rebounded. For example, Saigon followed closely and had reached 34 yuan, and all the prices that had fallen in the morning were restored, so the closing price was no different from the previous market, and it can be called a stable situation.

The early market for customer's indica rice was quite weak, because the sources from Jing, Wu, Jiangbei continuously arrived, and foreign rice poured in again, and Jiangbei had a whole batch waiting to be loaded. Therefore, the opening price was suppressed by the latecomers, going down about half a yuan compared to the previous day. However, after the price was slightly lower, shopkeepers and hoarders absorbed the rice. It is said that the large households in the banking industry were greedy, resulting in the market rebounding by nearly one yuan, and the final price was 0.3-0.5 yuan higher than the previous market.

74,500 bags of foreign rice have been shipped from Hong Kong in recent days. The earliest batch of Saigon orders will arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. It is said that the total is about 40,000 bags. There are already road goods sold on the market at 39.05 yuan, so the early morning market was quite fatigued, and the price was 0.5-0.6 yuan lower. In the afternoon, large households stocked up and absorbed the rice, and the price rebounded by nearly one yuan. High-quality foreign rice reached 35 yuan again, while broken rice, which had fallen to 27-28 yuan a few days ago, rose to 29.5 yuan and 29.2-3 yuan due to low prices.

### Flour Market Becomes Tighter - Wheat Creates New High Price

The current flour market situation continues to be tight. The guest route sales market shows that both the northern and southern groups are making arrangements, but the quota is not smooth because the raw material prices are expensive and the cost is high, and the factories are not willing to supply as much as possible. The retail transactions on this street are also not very smooth due to the end of the month, but they are all bought by hoarders, so the market remains tight. It is heard that the board price of Flour Mill No. 2 on this street is still 7.6 yuan, while the guest board price is 7.7 yuan, and the return of goods store list has to be raised by 0.05-0.1 yuan. The total turnover of the city is about 40,000 bags. There are also 2,000-3,000 bags of miscellaneous flour from the mainland being transacted, all of which are on this street, at a price of 7.0-7.05 yuan.

The wheat market situation is even more lively, because the Shanghai market is rising again and again, and the price of domestic products is increasing accordingly, resulting in a decrease in supply. Holders are unwilling to sell easily and are hoarded by merchants. Therefore, although the factory stores are good, sellers are few. As a result, the factories only transacted 2,000-3,000 bags yesterday, and the price was still at 12 yuan, while the price for delivery in stores has exceeded the 12-yuan mark, creating a new high price. It is heard that 4-5 trucks of goods were transacted in the market, and the highest price has reached 12.2 yuan.

### Oil Market - Soybean Oil Manipulation - Not Resting Until 100 Yuan

The manipulative elements in the soybean oil market are aiming for the price of Dalian iron bucket oil to reach 100 yuan per load (Si Ma weight), so the opening price yesterday rose by another 3.5 yuan (93.5 yuan on the 28th), to 97 yuan. The company with long positions released 10 barrels, and others followed suit by about one yuan. A total of 20 barrels of Qingdao Xiang oil were transacted at a price of 95 yuan. The price of road goods was 94 yuan. 100 loads of oil from this factory were at 76.5 yuan, 150 pieces of Yantai and Qi oil were at 71.5 yuan, 200 pieces of Qing Qi oil road goods were at 70.05 yuan, and 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were at 69.5 yuan. Because peanut oil lacks manipulators, it relies entirely on actual sales, so the underlying trend has stabilized. Yesterday, Jiaozhou oil still opened at 71 yuan, and 100 pieces were transacted, purchased by this street, etc. The Hong Kong group purchased 1,000 tins of Jiangbei tinned oil at a price of 93 yuan.

Yesterday, 340 pieces of soybean oil came from Yantai, 5,000 bags of soybeans and 30 pieces of tung oil came from Tianjin. Today, 420 bags of soybeans and 295 tins of raw oil were exported to Hong Kong.

### Yarn and Cotton - American Cotton Spot Price - Exceeds 10-Cent Mark - Local Cotton is Strong

The transaction of domestic cotton is not weak, but less than the previous day. The market price is stable, not much different from the previous day. In fact, the buying and selling among peers has been prosperous for consecutive days, and it was slightly quiet today. However, the Qingdao area purchased a relatively large amount of American cotton lint and cotton flowers, so the market is still tight. This is because the overseas European and American cotton markets are all rising, and the price of Indian cotton is rising unusually sharply. The spot price of American cotton has exceeded the 10-cent mark. This situation is exciting for those with long positions, so the foundation of the cotton market is more expensive than the yarn market, and the yarn factories have reopened the sale of large quantities of cotton yarn. It is inevitable that the raw materials will have to be compensated in the future. The sources from northern Jiangsu include 1,998 bags of lint and 1,435 bags of Changyinsha. The current situation of domestic cotton is recorded on the left.

Another message: The foreign cotton market price. The New York cotton market was firm early in the morning, and dispatches from Liverpool and Mumbai all reported increases. Overseas cotton merchants are uniformly bullish on American cotton, so they have come to buy, so the cotton price is unusually outstanding. Subsequently, spot traders were also actively trading, resulting in the closing price rising by more than 10 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market rose sharply by 14 rupees yesterday, including forecasts. Egyptian rose by more than 60 pounds, and Liverpool rose by more than 10 pence.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet in recent days, but all parties unanimously expect higher prices for raw cotton, but they are suffering from the difficulty of getting started due to the current high price. Yesterday, Shenxin Factory opened 7,000-8,000 pieces of 20s Double Horse yarn, and it is expected that American cotton will be active in the coming days. The factory price of American cotton yesterday, converted at a US exchange rate of 7.8125, is as follows:

### Yarn Market is Led by Cotton - Shenxin Opens More Than 9,000 Bales of Future Yarn

Yesterday's sluggish yarn market, assisted by the uniform rise of Indian and American cotton markets overseas, saw the market rise again, but actual transactions were still quiet. This is because all parties have traffic obstacles, and transportation cannot be rapid, so business cannot develop. However, in general, speculators, in view of the fact that foreign cotton is jumping like this, are eager to try, and there are not a few who are searching in the market. Unfortunately, actual sales cannot rise, which is a bit of a disappointment. However, the cotton market is firm, the factory's cost has increased. It is heard that Shenxin No. 9 Factory has opened a large quantity of 20s Double Horse yarn, 9,150 bales, at a price of 675 yuan, and the term is January-February next year, with a deposit of 60 yuan per bale.

At the morning opening, the members of the yarn industry gathered to talk and mostly thought positively, because American cotton has risen and Indian cotton has jumped even more sharply, so the goal is to see a major price hike, and the opening price rose by 14 yuan, the price of 20s Double Horse was 678 yuan. However, all the transactions were among peers for 10 bales, and the customer's group was inactive, and the market once held back, and slowly fell back, falling to 670 yuan. By the time of the closing, it had risen again by 3-4 yuan. The statistics of transactions in half a day show 1,277 bales, with the market price of 20s Double Horse rising by 8 yuan, Heavenly Girl rising by 9 yuan, and Double Globe rising by 7 yuan. Today, 30 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each group is listed on the left.

### Piece Goods - East Piece Goods Transactions Are Prosperous

The cloth market still lacks large spot sales, because the cloth price is lower than the cost, the factory board is unattainable, and the yarn and cotton have also risen sharply, so the cloth board is firm. Retail hand-held coarse cloth is still being sold at 0.1-0.2 cheaper than the market, but the amount is not large. The price of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth has risen by 0.2-0.3 per piece. The price of fine yarn goods has increased as the raw material price has risen sharply, and customers have a strong interest in spring poplin and other goods. Qingfeng striped plain poplin has opened for orders of more than 500 boxes. On this street, over 200 bales of Dapeng, Fugui, fine cloth, various factory coarse cloth, and fine twill have been transacted. Over 10,000 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and velvet cloth have been transacted. The Guangdong group has purchased over 2,000 pieces of Tongfeng floral velvet and 100-200 bales of fine cloth and coarse cloth. The ports of Suzhou and Anhui, Bengbu and Wuhu, have added quite a lot, but the situation in various ports in eastern Zhejiang is quiet. 29 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong today.

The market board for East piece goods, fine cloth, and fine twill was still strong yesterday, as peers on this street and off-street hoarders continued to search for them. In the morning, the market price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth hovered between 19.15 and 19.2. In the afternoon, Dongmian Ito and other firms opened up futures Dragon Head next month which caused prices of $20 per piece, the market sentiment became even stronger and spot sales once rose to $19.55. Later due to profit taking, dropped to $19.3, and at closing rose again to $19.45. Spot transactions for the day were over 1,000 pieces. Forward ordering for the next month by the firms also reached thousands of pieces. The open prices are as follows.

### How to Correct Children's Bad Habits

— Wan

A few days ago, this publication discussed the issues of children's education and punishment. I saw an experimental education article on correcting children's bad habits in a foreign magazine. I am sharing a few examples as a reference for elementary school teachers and parents.

A child, in a fit of anger, picks up a vase and tries to smash a glass window. An ordinary parent or teacher would definitely scold him and kick him out. However, the teacher at the experimental school doesn't. Instead, they say, "Go ahead and throw it! If you are prepared to pay for it." The child rudely asks, "How should I pay?" The teacher says, "A few afternoons without swimming. You should know how many swimming tickets this piece of glass is worth."

The child falls silent, and from then on, he gains the concept of "responsibility." Even if he breaks the glass, scolding is useless. Scolding has no relation to the loss from the damage.

A child who frequently steals small amounts of money is sent to the experimental school by his parents. After investigation, it is found that the money the child steals is used to buy friendship and is given to his friends. This is because his parents treat him very coldly and do not give him the emotional support he needs, leading to this bad outcome. The experimental school gives him what he needs, and he becomes a good child.

One day, a girl in the school plays outside for the entire day. The next day when she returns to school, the teacher doesn't scold her. Instead, they say, "You made us very unhappy. We like you so much, and we missed you so much when we didn't see you for a day. Come on, let's comb your hair. This is our only request!" She happily complies. She regards this good deed as glorious and unforgettable, while she also regards the "bad deed" she accidentally committed as shameful and unforgettable.

From these three cases, it can be seen that to correct children's bad habits, we should start from the source of the bad habits to be effective. Simply scolding and beating the child will not make him understand his mistakes. However, because the underlying cause is not eliminated, he often unknowingly commits the offense again. Then, I ask, what is the use of scolding?

There is also another point: children like to be praised. We often see parents indulge their children in a distorted way, but rarely see them praise and encourage their children. If a child does a good deed, praise will make him decide to do it again. If a child is about to do a good deed, praise will help him accomplish it quickly. This kind of psychology is actually present in adults as well, but because adults are more "worldly," the effect of praise is smaller. Pure childlike hearts need some encouragement.

When parents are troubled by their children's bad habits, and when teachers are angry at the naughtiness of elementary school students, if they punish them, they must consider the effectiveness of the punishment. Treating children as punching bags is not right. They should seek a fundamental solution, as mentioned above, I believe.

### Suggestions Regarding School Meal Fees

— Zhang Fuyong

After reading a certain parent's article on "Increasing Meal Fees" in Chunqiu, in addition to expressing deep "admiration" for those rice merchants, I also feel that there are "two points" that can be suggested to the wise school authorities:

Originally, the payment of meal fees in ordinary schools is stipulated to be paid in one lump sum. This is to allow the kitchen to make accurate budgets, which is a very legitimate and sufficient reason and cannot be disputed. However, at a time like the present, when prices are soaring and fluctuating in the isolated island, if we still rigidly adhere to the existing rules and implement the regulations that "meal fees are paid in one lump sum, any surplus will be returned, and any deficit will be supplemented," I absolutely cannot agree. This is because there are many drawbacks to this. The most obvious is the "teacher engaging in the rice business" and the "school swallowing a large sum of money under the guise of a minor incident" that a certain parent personally experienced.

Of course, those teachers "engaging in the rice business" are not "good teachers," and schools that "swallow a large sum of money" are not "good institutions." However, there are still many excellent schools on the isolated island that are committed to "cultivating talents for a hundred years" and diligently training young people. I sincerely hope that these places where pillars of society are being molded will maintain warm emotions between teachers, students, and parents and not be driven to extremes by the issue of meal fees.

However, this is not a simple matter of concession, but a need to fundamentally improve the method of paying meal fees. Precisely because the cost of living on the isolated island is determined by fluctuations in market prices, I believe that the payment of meal expenses must be implemented on a "monthly basis"—the amount of the monthly meal fee should be determined based on the market prices of various goods within that month. If market prices rise, there is no need to be polite; an appropriate proportion can be increased. At this time, I think parents will understand the difficulties of the school authorities and the kitchen. Similarly, when market prices fall, the cost of meals for that month should also be reduced as much as possible. Do not adopt the base goal of "money first" and lose conscience by "taking advantage of the fire" completely forgetting that you are a sacred "educator."

I can list a few advantages of this method of paying meal fees monthly below:

(1) Determining the monthly meal fee based on the rise and fall of market prices can not only avoid unnecessary misunderstandings between the two parties but also enable parents with tight finances to easily implement so-called "installment payments," avoiding being driven to the "end of their rope" due to the meal fees for several children at the beginning of the school term.

(2) Eliminates the drawbacks criticized by a certain parent, such as "not increasing prices when they rise, but increasing them by 60% when they fall."

(3) At a minimum, the school can manage the meals smoothly, and parents can express satisfaction with the payment of fees, avoiding disputes over meal fees.

This method has already been implemented by several schools. I believe that schools that have not yet implemented this method and are still experiencing difficulties may as well try it, and they will definitely achieve satisfactory results.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 18: Discussing Economic Prosperity and the Old City; Narrating the Vestiges of Marriage Robbery

He Liyu asked: "How did Shanghai prosper again later?" Shao Huihua said: "At that time, I was studying abroad and could not know all the details. But I only knew that China was recovering after the war, and Shanghai was gradually prospering again. The first reason was that China was gradually transforming from an agricultural country into an industrial country. This was what an economist studying China told me when I was abroad. He said: During the Sino-Japanese War, the wealthy from the interior all fled to Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai had a lot of floating capital. The deposits in many banks, even with restrictions on withdrawals, were more than before the war. However, once a person has money, they always want to use it and cannot simply store it in the bank. There are also some people who simply don't trust banks. They have suffered losses from banks several times, so they have thousands or tens of thousands of banknotes hidden in iron boxes at home. There are also some who like to engage in speculative activities, doing things like short selling and buying short. Whether it's public bonds, gold, cloth, or flour, they are not experts themselves. They are complacent when they get a small profit, but when they try to do it on a larger scale, they end up with a big loss. There are also some who take this opportunity to do things that benefit themselves at the expense of others, such as hoarding rice, piling up coal, and buying and selling copper and iron. When the European war started, they thought: Many people made a fortune during the First European War, so paints, western medicine, newspapers, wool, etc., were all stockpiled in the market. In fact, there was no shortage of goods in the market to control, and there were still ways to transport them in when the shipping routes were not cut off. However, after this monopoly, goods were scarce, and the market was chaotic. This is what I mean by those who are good at using their floating capital. Some who are not good at using it send their floating capital to all the gambling houses. So, during the Sino-Japanese War, it was precisely when the gambling houses in Shanghai were rampant, and every gambling house was packed with people, extravagant and wanton, all you could see were banknotes and chips. Why was this so? It was because floating capital was filling Shanghai! As for other entertainment places, dance halls, young men and women, resulting in tragedies, there is no need to talk about them. However, once the war is over, it cannot be like this again, and the floating capital cannot be allowed to float around anymore. Now that Shanghai has changed its face, improper businesses will be strictly banned. The exchange is not allowed to do futures trading, and short selling is of course extinct. Basically, in a word, all the people's capital is used for normal purposes. What is the proper use? It is post-war industrial development. Even if you want to make a fortune, you have to put in the effort and contribute to society. If you do those speculative activities, how is this different from gambling?" (209)

### Unreasonable Child Punishment Method

— Yu Jia

My younger sister studies at the elementary school affiliated with a certain girls' middle school on Dagu Road. Yesterday, she came home and told me that a classmate in the first grade at her school was caught stealing someone else's pencil eraser. The teacher put a piece of paper on her chest that said "I steal things," forced her to stand in a public place so that all the students could see her, and encouraged everyone to humiliate her. She was just a nine-year-old girl, so ashamed that her face turned green. When I heard this, I couldn't help but shiver. Ah! This is the so-called new-style child education? This is following the Ministry of Education's regulations prohibiting corporal punishment?

The fate of Chinese children seems to be tragic from birth. Just escaping from the torture of the old-fashioned private schools, they must endure this new-style spiritual flogging. Think about it, she is only nine years old. No matter how serious the crime she committed, such cruel punishment should not be inflicted on her. Moreover, the crime is nothing more than a lack of self-control, taking something she liked that was not hers. Logically, we really cannot be too demanding of a nine-year-old girl. Of course, we must not ignore or condone the mistakes she made, but wouldn't it be enough to patiently guide her and use spiritual influence to make her realize her mistakes? Shattering a young and fragile heart is by no means more civilized than inflicting physical whippings. Perhaps this teacher also thinks that killing the chicken to scare the monkey will make the other students feel terrified and rejoice in their own good fortune. That's wrong? As long as we imagine the impact that this new-style punishment can have on a child's entire life, we cannot help but be alarmed. All humans have self-esteem. Can children be an exception? Physical pain can be forgotten over time, but how will a clever teacher repair the destruction of self-esteem? Don't think it's just a piece of paper, don't think it's only posted for one day. The brand on a naive heart can never be erased, and we can predict its tragic consequences. We can imagine the contempt, ridicule, indifference, and distrust that classmates will have towards her in the future. We can assert the discrimination and mental suffering she will endure in the future. Don't think that children's hearts are simple. Precisely because their hearts are simple, they are easily crushed. Protecting them is already not enough, yet they are violently struck. Those who inflict the blows are also the elementary school teachers entrusted by parents and to whom a person's entire future is entrusted. Can we say this is excusable? What punishment are you talking about? Isn't this paper a seal that forces the child to continue her mistakes and closes the door to her reform?

Wise teachers! I sincerely hope that you clearly recognize your responsibilities. Your every move affects the future of countless children. Your casual words and actions will have an impact on children that you yourselves cannot measure. I don't want to say anything more about the sacredness of education, but educators should pay serious attention to the heavy burden of education, especially in this era of rapid change.

Entertainment World

### Robert Taylor Talks About Screen Life

— Xin Liang

Robert Taylor tells us that when he had just graduated from Pomona College, he naturally had to find a position to work. He said, "I was very lucky at the time. After I had the opportunity to enter the film company as a regular actor, the company authorities and the general audience looked up to me very much. I still haven't forgotten that warm encouragement and praise!"

Robert Taylor is truly a well-known superstar in today's Hollywood film industry. He continued to tell us: "Indeed, being engaged in screen life is not as free and easy as the average outsider imagines. However, compared to other burdensome tasks, the life under the spotlights is not the hardest. I get up at six o'clock every day, and after nine o'clock, I go to work in the photography studio. The time I go home is always after eight o'clock. I work almost twelve hours a day. Being engaged in the film industry is no different from being engaged in other departments. As an actor, there are many opportunities for promotion, as long as a person works seriously and performs well, he is sure to achieve amazing success in the film industry.

"Speaking personally," he also said, "movie actors can also lead any kind of life they like. On Saturday nights, he can go to various entertainment venues to recover his tired spirits from the week, just like other people.

When a popular movie star walks into a certain public place, of course, it will cause countless "movie fans" to go crazy. Taylor doesn't complain about this craze and commotion.

All in all, Taylor is very satisfied with the screen life he lives. He said, "Anyone who resents eating the movie meal should come up with some kind of amateur hobby (playing the violin, for example, is a very good example) to regulate the monotony of their life in the film industry."

### Eye-Protection Screen Can Prevent Movie Fans From Damaging Their Eyesight

— Xin Ying

Movie damage to eyesight is a question of the utmost concern to movie fans and is often brought up for discussion. The main reason is the unsuitability of the screen's light. If a screen and projector lamp are too large compared to each other, out of proportion, or the reflected light is too low, or the emitted light is not strong enough to allow people sitting in every corner of the theater to see clearly, these are all sufficient to damage eyesight. Too weak light emitted from the projector lamp is another common drawback.

So, to remedy these shortcomings, the key is to choose screens and projectors that are suitable for every seat in the theater. According to the results of expert research, this is an engineering problem. Recently, in order to minimize screen damage to movie fans' eyesight, someone has invented a new type of Syorex screen. This is indeed a new invention for movie theaters. The Grand China Theater, which will open soon, has purchased this new type of screen and has already completed its installation.

The special advantage of this new type of screen is that the reflected light is the same intensity in every seat in the theater. At the same time, this screen also contains color photosensitivity, and the outside is covered with a new medium that can absorb color. As a result, whether projecting color or displaying black and white films, the light on the screen is very clear, making the audience feel extra satisfied.

New Film Introduction

### Stanley and Livingstone

— Qi Hua

"Stanley and Livingstone" is the story of New York Herald reporter Stanley's long trek through the African forest in 1870 to find British doctor Livingstone. This year is the 35th anniversary of Stanley's death, and 20th Century Fox specifically produced this "Stanley and Livingstone" to commemorate him. Stanley's spirit of hard work and courage is naturally worth commemorating by later generations. However, due to the narrow-mindedness of racial discrimination in Britain and the United States, we have seen the cruel slaughter of people of color in various tones, which sets off the "civilization" of white people in wild and war films. "Battlefield Souls" and "Gunga Din" are the most prominent examples; "Stanley and Livingstone" is naturally also produced from this perspective, although its theme has changed from "aggression" to "influence," such as Dr. Livingstone leading the natives in Africa to sing hymns, and the natives thanking him for treating their diseases, but in the end, Stanley's exposure to Africa to fulfill Dr. Livingstone's will is still their consistent policy—people of color are an inferior race, and it should be they who convert them.

Director King Henry seems unable to fully display his talents here. The first reason is that the story is straightforward and lacks opportunities for development; the second reason is that when Stanley penetrates the African interior, the overall organization is not concise enough. This not only fails to show Stanley's hardships, but also makes the discovery of Dr. Livingstone weak and powerless.

This further affects Spencer Tracy's acting skills. His Stanley, except for a few outstanding shots at the Royal Geographical Society meeting, is otherwise mediocre. Nancy Kelly and Richard Greene also did not achieve much.

Famous amateur actor Mr. Huang Jingbo is a member of the Shanghai Ping Society. He has studied drama in great depth and thoroughly investigates even the slightest nuances of each word and melody. Not only do the members of the Ping Society recognize him as a pillar of the troupe, but also everyone in Shanghai who has heard Mr. Huang's performance praises his talent. This time, Ms. Wang Yurong, daughter of Wang Yaoqing, came to Shanghai, and Mr. Huang, realizing that this was an opportunity not to be missed, and Ms. Wang Yurong (who is also a distinguished disciple of Wang Yaoqing), introduced him.

### Leisurely Sketches of the Entertainment World (Gan Er) Magic

— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan

Magic, also called illusion, the characters "magic" and "illusion" show that it is not real.

But real magic cannot be said to be absolutely non-existent. Such mysterious and bizarre things as "dismembering a child's body into several pieces and then being able to restore it" are said to be still performed by some people on the streets. Unfortunately, I have never seen it with my own eyes, which is a great regret!

The magic performed on stage now is mostly the so-called "Western magic" after the "Eastern expansion of European customs." The key lies entirely in the special construction of the props.

### Extracurricular Notes

Two Silly Gentlemen in the Peking Opera World of Peiping

After a while, Rongfu led the tour of the various courtyards in his mansion, as well as the precious antiques, rosewood, and various utensils. Later, I heard from the elders of the old capital that during the late Qing Dynasty, when Empress Dowager Cixi ruled behind the curtain, Rong was Minister of Internal Affairs. All items presented from various places had to be reviewed by Rong Xiang first. Rare treasures were often intercepted by him for his mansion. In addition, in order to please Rong Xiang, foreign vassals sometimes prepared two copies of each item, both to avoid the disaster of being intercepted and to be presented for imperial review as soon as possible. Therefore, the treasures collected in Rong's mansion were indeed numerous and exquisite. That day, my colleague, engineer Bill (an American), and I were fortunate to feast our eyes, ears, mouth, and nose (there was a kind of Western snuff, but it was the first time my Western friend had smelled it). By the time I went to Peiping again in 1933, I suddenly heard that Rong had already sold his house, and all the furniture in the house had been forcibly taken away. Speaking of it, this matter was really absurd and ridiculous. It turned out that Zhifeng was also a careless ghost. Apart from eating, drinking, and having fun, he did not personally handle even the biggest things. Later, he met a person outside and opened a flower shop. He played with fresh flowers all day long, and he stayed outside with the flowers for twenty-seven or eight days out of the month. Slowly, he ran into deficit and was forced by the creditors, so he thought of selling the property. (West Mansion) Coincidentally, Tang Yulin, Chairman of Rehe Province, had long wanted to buy a large mansion in Peiping to compete with Wan Fulin's mansion (Wan had also purchased the old mansion of a prince. After renovation, it was magnificent and majestic, the crown of private residences in the city). Someone brought them together, and they agreed on a price of 100,000 yuan. Before and after, the entire transaction was handled by a manager in the Rong mansion. Rong Jun did not want to lose face by selling his ancestral property, and he was afraid that the East Mansion would come out to stop him, so he always hid in the dark and rarely went home! (153)
