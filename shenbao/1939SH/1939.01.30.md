### Japanese Military Setback Leads to Strategic Change; Proof of Chinese Military Confidence; Chinese Forces in Shanxi Province Maintain Control as Main Force; Japanese Forces in Guangdong Province Eye Beihai, Chinese Forces on High Alert

(Hong Kong) No major battles are currently taking place on any fronts, though there are intense local engagements. One military expert speculates that a second large-scale decisive battle between Chinese and Japanese forces is unlikely to occur in the short term. The Japanese military, seemingly aware of their rash missteps, appear to be shifting their operational plans. Despite repeated failed attacks by the Japanese forces in Pu, both sides have suffered considerable casualties. However, the Chinese forces have maintained their position as the main force controlling the overall situation. Furthermore, guerrilla tactics are being employed at all times to harass and contain the enemy. At present, small-scale battles frequently occur along the Zhongtiao Mountain and Datong-Puzhou Railway line, with continuous artillery duels along the river. Chinese infantry and artillery are deployed along the river defense, with fortified positions. Japanese forces in Guangdong Province are reportedly planning a combined sea, land, and air offensive, and the Chinese military is on high alert. (Special dispatch, 8:00 PM on the 29th)

### Japanese Forces Launch Renewed Attacks on Multiple Fronts; Intense Fighting in Southern Shanxi

Yuanqu: The retreating Japanese forces in southern Shanxi have recently shown signs of renewed activity, clinging to the delusion of wiping out Chinese strength in the triangular area.

(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman recently told reporters that Japanese forces in southwestern Shanxi have launched three general offensives against Chinese positions in Zhongtiao Mountain in the past ten days, all of which have resulted in failure, with casualties reaching over 7,000. Japanese forces in eastern Shanxi have launched offensives against Hes順, Liaoxian, and other locations in eastern Shanxi since the 24th of this month, and Chinese forces are intercepting them on multiple fronts. According to the spokesman, the Japanese forces' current offensive in the southwest of Shanxi aims to "pacify" the Chinese forces in the mountains of southwestern Shanxi to avoid any worries when crossing the river to attack Shaanxi. Although this attempt by the Japanese military has failed, their ambition to invade Shaanxi Province has not waned. They are currently transferring reinforcements from the Pinghan and Zhengtai railway lines in an attempt to achieve their goal. (Dispatch from the 29th)

### Victory Reports from Guerrilla Units in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces

Miluo: Chinese guerrilla units in the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi border areas have repeatedly reported victories since the evening of New Year's Day this year. According to reports today: (1) A certain unit destroyed two railway bridges at Pingshuipu near Puqi, and Japanese trains traveling between Wuhan and Yueyang have been suspended. (2) On the evening of the 27th, another unit killed over 20 Japanese soldiers between Tongcheng and Chongyang. In order to prevent the Japanese military from harming residents, Chinese guerrilla units all left the four characters "Serve the Country with Utmost Loyalty" after completing their missions. However, the Japanese military still vented their anger on innocent Chinese civilians, committing acts of rape, plunder, and murder in the Tongcheng area for days, doing everything imaginable. They even burned down two to three thousand houses near the incident site, resulting in the desolation of dozens of miles, and their brutality is unprecedented and unseen in the human world. (Dispatch from the 29th)

(Changsha) The reporter recently went to the Longmen Factory front on the right flank of the Jiuling Mountains for an on-site inspection and obtained a very good impression. Along the way, I saw troops strengthening fortifications and actively training in the severe cold, all with high spirits. Farmers are still engaged in farming, with the same level of intensity as usual. The businesses in the towns of Xianzhang, Jiayi, and Changshou are even more prosperous than in the past. The people are assisting the army in transporting supplies, fully demonstrating the spirit of military-civilian cooperation. This is indeed a major advancement in the second phase of the war of resistance. Longmen Factory is located on the border of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, a crucial pass through Pingjiang, Tongxiushui, and Tongcheng. Mount Mufu stands tall in the northwest, and Dongyang stretches across the southeast, with towering mountains serving as a barrier. Moreover, the people are heroic and are currently launching a large-scale movement to defend their homeland, cooperating with the regular army in counterattacks. If the Japanese military wants to bypass the natural defenses of the Jiuling Mountains and attempt to make inroads into this area, they will undoubtedly be defeated. (Dispatch from the 29th)

### Chinese Education During the War of Resistance

(Chongqing) Although 54 universities, technical schools, libraries, and 140 other institutions have been destroyed in China due to the war, a new education system is being built in the interior to train China's future citizens and leaders. The Sino-Japanese War has not only brought about great political and industrial reforms in China, but also great cultural changes. According to this decision, China has 180 important cultural institutions and 122 universities and specialized schools that have been destroyed or fallen into Japanese-occupied areas. In addition, of the 3,330 middle schools, 1,407 have been destroyed. Of the 2,912 public and private libraries, 1,436 have been destroyed. As for the percentage of students who have dropped out of school, the percentage of university students is 71.2%, middle school students is 43.1%, and primary school students is 49.3%. It is certain that 30 universities have been completely destroyed due to the war. The loss suffered by cultural institutions is estimated at 217,401,743 yuan.

Editorial

### Prospects of the World Crisis

The recent state and trend of Europe can be said to have reached a point where war is inevitable. War is not an unexpected change; it is only by rare good fortune that it can be avoided. The fuse has been lit, and the explosion is imminent. Those who say that it can still be contained must rely on extraordinary means to have any chance of hope, but extraordinary means cannot be guaranteed. There are many who have said this, and the return of the American ambassadors to Britain, France, Germany, and Italy two decades ago to report on their duties particularly emphasized it. In the last two decades, the trend has become even more obvious. The capture of Barcelona by the Spanish Nationalist forces, with the Republican government forces appearing unable to continue fighting, such a rapid turn of events can be seen as the final moment after the fuse has been lit. From this day, this time, this situation, this scene, until the outbreak of war, it only requires the Nationalist forces to take advantage of the momentum and advance further, as the Italian masses advocated, "Charge directly into France," then war will come. From this day, this time, this situation, this scene, until the elimination of the disaster of war, it depends on the Italian soldiers in the Nationalist forces reining in their horses at the edge of the cliff, as Italian Prime Minister Mussolini guaranteed, "Withdraw from the western border," then peace can be maintained. The two different trends are both in the hands of Mr. Mussolini. According to its essence, it is not that withdrawing troops is more difficult than attacking, but in recent times, what has been expressed by the Italian government and public has all targeted France. Italy does not fail to say that Italy's wishes are based on facts and justice, and that it has nothing to do with the Spanish Civil War. However, who will believe that Italy will seek to realize its wishes after withdrawing its volunteer soldiers from Spain? If the Italian troops are not withdrawn, then in the northeast, Germany; in the southeast, Italy; in the southwest, Spain. Those surrounding France are all enemies on three sides, not only separated from Annam by Shao, but also separated from its African territories. Moreover, overseas in Annam, there are already Japanese naval and air forces, preparing to land in Beihai, China, echoing and watching Annam with the full-fledged countries of Europe. With Italy's layout like this, and its wishes like that, will it be abandoned for now and re-planned for another day? Will France hand over its territory as compensation for Italy's wishes?

If the situation and trends of France and Italy are like this, what about other countries? Examining what Germany and Italy are plotting, the strategy of defeating them individually is at the center, with France being the first target to be defeated. This is not only evidenced by the public opinion created by Germany and Italy, but their diplomatic activities are also clearly visible. In terms of diplomacy: towards Britain, they strive to alienate British-French relations; towards the Soviet Union, they claim that what the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact is defending against is Germany, not Italy. Therefore, Germany has a joint declaration with France on December 6, and engages in superficial dealings with Soviet commercial officials to offset the seriousness of the Franco-Soviet Pact, leaving the responsibility for putting pressure on France to Italy alone; towards the Central European countries, after subduing Czechoslovakia, they use all means of appeasement towards Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Romania. The significance of this is to divide the satellites of the Soviet Union and France in order to isolate the friction between the Soviet Union and Germany, and to trap France in isolation so that Germany and Italy can have no worries in the Mediterranean once something happens. If this were to completely fulfill Germany and Italy's plans, then Italy would begin to think that skinning and eating France is as easy as lifting a hand, or even without bloodshed.

However, France is not Czechoslovakia. The French army has a great reputation, its navy is undoubtedly superior to Italy, and its history, culture, and nation have their own ways to maintain the honor of the country. Kneeling to foreign humiliation and waiting to be slaughtered is seen in Czechoslovakia, but not in France. Moreover, diplomacy, which is skillful and complex, is based on shared interests and harm. The recent lesson is not far away: Czechoslovakia did not receive foreign aid from the Franco-Czech agreement, and eventually it was divided up like melons and beans. How can the Central European countries not follow suit when Germany and Italy threaten and lure them? However, to say that Germany and Italy's appeasement of the Central European countries has created an iron wall in the rear is to believe in diplomacy and ignore the interests of all. Once there is a war, the lines between friends and enemies will need to be re-aligned. Therefore, under the strategy of individual defeat: although it is considered the ultimate goal to subdue France without a fight, France will inevitably fight back; although the wish is that the dispute will not go beyond the scope of France and Italy, Central Europe is unpredictable. As for the attitude of the great powers such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, it has long been seen through and despised by the aggressor nations, as they only wish to be virtuous alone and to share the blessings. Over the past seven or eight years, all major international changes have originated from this. Until recently, the aggressor nations have been pressing closer and closer, forcing the great powers to recognize the aggressors' faces as ferocious, and to recognize their ambitions as insatiable. Thus, they have shown the people that they are gradually learning to cheer up. If France and Italy meet each other with weapons, the great powers will probably no longer stand by. Therefore, it is said that the day France and Italy clash will be the beginning of the Second World War, and this is its eve. The only hope is that the great powers will step forward and boldly express that the democratic countries will share the difficulties together; or even go a step further and individually defeat the aggressor groups, then peace may be hoped for.

### Southwest Development: Active Investment from All Sides

Organizing Reclamation and Industrial Companies for Large-Scale Economic Construction

(Hong Kong) Economic circles and authorities recently established the Southwest Economic Construction Committee, allocating 20 million yuan to implement various development plans. Currently, among the groups investing in national construction are the Hua Xi Reclamation Company, organized by Huang Xiu Feng and others, with a capital of 5 million yuan, actively proceeding; Liu Wenhui's Da Hua Industrial Company, with a capital of 10 million yuan, specializing in developing the resource-rich areas of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Xikang; Hu Wenhu's decision to invest 30 million yuan to develop Yunnan Province's resources. Other entities, such as the National Official Merchant Bank and various foreign merchants from Britain and the United States, are also very active in investing in Southwest construction. China, Communications, and other banks have also decided to jointly establish a large-scale cotton mill in Kunming with the Fudian New Bank, raising funds with a planned capacity of 25,000 spindles. A preparatory committee has already been established, with Song Ziwen and Qian Xinzhi planning in Hong Kong. According to Zheng Tieru, the Hong Kong branch manager of the Bank of China, the mill's organization will be finalized soon. It is also learned that the four major banks, namely the Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, have established 70 branches in the Northwest, Sichuan, and Xikang regions to promote development work. (Special dispatch from 9 PM on the 29th)

(Chongqing) According to Hua Fang news, Xikang's gold production has long been well-known. Recently, the central government and local authorities jointly established a gold mining bureau, appointing Lin Yun, former president of Shandong University, as the director to carry out all activities. To gain insight into the actual situation of gold production in Xikang, the reporter specially requested Dr. Li Chunyu, who has surveyed the geology of Sichuan and Xikang, to give his views. Dr. Li first stated that gold is produced everywhere in Xikang, especially in Daofu and Zhanhua. Guangduo of Zhanhua conducted extensive investigations in the Maike River area. The saying "walking on straw sandals over land filled with gold," although an exaggeration, is indeed quite rich. Because the geology of Xikang belongs to metamorphic rock, there are very thin quartz veins containing a lot of gold. Through natural forces, the quartz is broken, and the gold flows into the gravel. Its distribution in the water has less in the main streams and more in the tributaries. The amount of gold produced is still difficult to estimate, but the amount of gold produced is directly proportional to the number of workers. If the local situation can be eased and food can be supplied, the future of gold panning is very promising, he said. (Quick News Agency dispatch on the 29th)

### French Postal Air Service Extended to Hong Kong

(Hong Kong) The final destination of the French postal air service in the Far East was originally in Hanoi, Annam.

It is reported that the French authorities are currently negotiating with the British side in Hong Kong, requesting permission for French airline mail planes to fly to Hong Kong in order to facilitate the transfer of mail between Central Europe and China. It is heard that this negotiation will be successful soon. According to inquiries made to the local post office, it is understood that China also very much supports the ability of French mail planes to directly reach Hong Kong. Once the negotiations between the British and French postal air services are successful, the local post office will publish a notice to inform the public, it is said.

### Japan Plans to Co-opt Germany and Italy into Military Alliance

(Paris) The European edition of the New York People's Forum recently published a telegram from the East, stating that it is widely rumored here that General Oshima, the Japanese ambassador to Germany, and Shiratori Toshio, the ambassador to Italy, have been conducting important talks with the authorities of their respective host countries for several days. The discussions revolve around strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact. Originally, the clauses of this pact were only for the prevention of the spread of communism. Now, it is proposed to amend it into a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. While this matter is related to the current duties of the two ambassadors, Oshima also participated in the past when the Anti-Comintern Pact was signed, so the relationship is very close. It is heard that after discussions in Sanremo, Italy, the two ambassadors submitted their results to the meeting of Japanese ambassadors to European countries held in Paris on the 27th of this month. Subsequently, a conference will be convened in Berlin or Rome to continue the discussions. The Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, and the ambassador to Poland, Sakoh, will also participate at that time.

### The Vanguard of the Guangzhou Labor Training Class

— Ren Zhong

The 300,000 workers of Guangzhou are already organized and valiantly undertaking combat duties in the War of Resistance. After the fall of Guangzhou, thirty vanguard warriors marched into the mountains, preparing to launch extensive guerrilla warfare.

One month after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, workers in Guangzhou's oil pressing, printing, machinery, electrical, and construction industries, as well as rickshaw pullers and coolies, began to pay attention to its organization. A young worker—Chen Lizhou—first felt the necessity of organizing, and in his life of hardship, he already felt that workers must unite, especially under the brutal and crazed invasion. Similarly, every worker in Guangzhou saw that the enemy's brutal attacks would soon be directed at them, so they consciously rose up to organize, overcame many difficulties, and finally established a labor training class.

Young workers came in batches to receive training. After intensive training for one month per term for four months, the comrades of the labor training class numbered more than 3,000. Their strength was considerable! More than 3,000 new warriors played a huge role in promoting the cause among the workers of Guangzhou and even the entire Guangdong! Patriotic enthusiasm filled every factory and workshop, and the work of national salvation influenced farmers, merchants, and other groups.

The labor training class is a group supported by all 300,000 workers in Guangzhou, and it is most capable of approaching the masses of workers because they have friendly relations and the same vital interests. Therefore, the connection and unity are tighter than any professional group.

The "Classmates Association" is a major driving force for them to mobilize the masses to participate in the anti-Japanese movement. In the past three months, nearly 100,000 people have joined. Groups of farmers, workers, peddlers, boatmen... all came to join. Under the difficult conditions of the "class" lacking funds and unable to promote the work, the workers themselves took out their hard-earned money to buy books, newspapers, and paper. From the tireless work of the whole day, they took the time to sing, perform plays, and regularly publish street wall newspapers, gathering many friends to read books and newspapers and discuss current affairs.

When the news that the mother of guerrillas—Old Lady Zhao—arrived in Guangzhou, it spread to the "Labor Training Class," so there was a "Labor Welcome Team" that went to the station to greet her in a heavy rain. Shouts of "Long live China!" "Long live the mother of guerrillas!" "Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation!" rang out. The old work clothes were soaked through the old shirts, and the rainwater flowing through the dirty skin smelled bad. A brocade banner was held high in the procession and handed to Old Lady Zhao amid enthusiastic cheers.

On Double Tenth Day, the national donation movement was surging. The Guangzhou workers, who usually had nothing to spare, also searched their pockets for the few copper coins they had. Every comrade who participated in the wall newspapers, singing, transportation, and stretcher bearing ran to the rural villages to find the friends they knew to participate in the donation, and as a result, they collected a total of 2,186 yuan! This is the accumulation of every penny from tens of millions of workers, and this number shows the workers' loyalty and love for the motherland.

On November 17, 30,000 young workers and students held a singing parade in Guangzhou. On the 21st, the citizens of Guangzhou retreated in a unprepared panic. Groups of labor salvation workers destroyed important factories and workshops and then mostly left the city because the labor comrades who were unwilling to be slaves of the subjugated nation were not used by the enemy.

The "Labor Cadres" armed with copper helmets and straw sandals, holding rifles and hand grenades, marched on the Guangzhou-Huaxian Road. The raging flames destroyed almost all of Guangzhou. More than 30 enemy planes swept over the city and dropped heavy bombs. The worker cadres bravely broke out of the encirclement and arrived at Jiahexu. The number of people was reduced by a part, and the remaining total was 113.

"Reorganize our ranks"! One hundred and thirteen people lined up in an iron row, turned west at Jiahexu to Guanyao Lubao, and traveled north along the river to Qingyuan at night. For three days and three nights, they were hungry and wearing single clothes. More than ten comrades who were sick dragged behind the team and went to a village to rest. That was "Shahexu," a small town of more than 100 households. The people thought it was a disturbing army and ran away. Nothing could be bought in the village. The workers still all stayed and began to do mass work. First, they approached the many fleeing people and helped them maintain law and order, cut wood, thresh rice, carry grain, and carry water. After three days, the number of people in the market increased, and prices immediately fell.

They discovered a huge force: more than 300 guns for self-defense in more than 100 households! Strong men carried guns and asked to fight guerrilla warfare. The high morale of the masses had reached its peak. This was a great opportunity for the comrades to organize through propaganda. People were talking individually in the corners of the village. After some propaganda, the villagers had a clear understanding of the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, and more villagers asked to join the organization of "Labor Cadres."

The comrades only got one meal of white rice a day. In the situation of meager economy, they could not take all the villagers away. However, they could still maintain contact between the two. Most of the workers went to Qujiang to take on the transportation work of the military station's general supervisor, and a small part continued to do organizational work. The worker cadres are the center of their entire working masses. They decided to supplement some cadres in Qujiang, and at the same time, they selected 30 work cadres with higher cultural and political levels, resolute and brave, and able to fight independently, to go to the northern Guangdong area to mobilize the masses and prepare for future guerrilla warfare. These 30 cadres are the vanguard of the steel army. "Loyalty, courage, unity, perseverance, and struggle" are the team's training they share in northern Guangdong.

Iron will, iron discipline, iron torrent, we are the steel army, we go to the front line, our mission is to seek national liberation and strive for world peace. That kind of high-pitched rough voice roared out the songs they wrote themselves. In a heated atmosphere, 30 national warriors embarked on their journey.

### Zhenjiang Pseudo-Organization Extensively Scavenges Merchants and People

Forcibly Collecting Land Tax, Villagers Angrily Refuse to Pay; Several Pseudo-Soldiers Killed or Wounded During "Purge of the Countryside"

Zhenjiang Correspondence: The pseudo-organization in Zhenjiang has recently used its scavenging skills to forcibly collect land taxes from farmers in various rural areas. Because most farmers are unwilling to pay, the pseudo-county government has sent the connected ballots to the pseudo-autonomous associations in various districts to extort from households. Each mu (unit of land) is levied an exorbitant tax of about 6 jiao. If anyone refuses to pay, the pseudo-police or Japanese soldiers will go to the countryside to arrest and coerce them. The villagers cannot bear the harassment and automatically request nearby guerrillas to come and protect them. The pseudo-organization has also set up pseudo-tax collection offices and ticket inspection offices in various rural areas and at the four city gates to collect pseudo "goods tax." Merchants must declare the tax according to their "tax rules" for any goods entering, leaving, or being transported, and then go through the ticket inspection procedures along the way before they can reach their destination. The highest tax rate is 25%, and the lowest is 16%. However, when inspecting the tickets, merchants must also pay a considerable fee to the pseudo-officials. This is still within the so-called "Dantu County" area. If they want to export to neighboring counties, they have to change the road permit. The categories are not only abnormally complicated, but the expenses are also alarmingly high.

The market around Zhongzheng Road seems to have recovered on the surface. However, the various old goods stalls and cigarette paper stalls listed on the streets after the robbery have gradually closed down, and they have been replaced by eye-catching Japanese shops and restaurants that offer "special hospitality for women." As for ordinary shops, only 30% to 40% have resumed business. Therefore, there are still shops in the city that have been sealed by the Japanese Gendarmerie because no one has returned to do business. The pseudo-organization is now setting up a pseudo "Dantu County Chamber of Commerce" at the old site of the Iron Guild in front of the Stone Arch Bridge (this place was previously used as a comfort station). The position of pseudo-chairman has not yet been selected, but it has actively scavenged merchants and people. Merchants who resume business must register with the pseudo-association and pay various fees, including a registration fee of 5 jiao per household and a monthly fee ranging from 3 jiao, 6 jiao, 1 yuan, to 2 yuan per household. In addition, they must also pay a business license fee. According to the estimated capital, they have to pay a license fee of 1 yuan and 5 jiao for every 500 yuan, and so on in proportion. Merchants are pained by this kind of exploitation, so most of them have no intention of resuming business to avoid being extorted by the traitors in the pseudo-organization. The Japanese troops stationed in Zhenjiang are now the Guanglv troops, with four or five hundred people, stationed in the Five Great Halls, Boxian Ancestral Hall, Bank of China, and Railway Station. The Japanese Gendarmerie and Appeasement Squads are set up in the Central Bank. The Japanese soldiers are now forcing people to get vaccinated. When entering and leaving the city gates, they must show their "Good Citizen Certificate" and vaccination certificate. The previous first, second, and third phases of the epidemic prevention injection certificates have all been declared invalid. As for residents who travel outside and plan to take the train controlled by the Japanese army, they must first obtain a pass from the Japanese Appeasement Squad. The fee for obtaining the certificate is stipulated to be 5 jiao, but this pass cannot be obtained without a traitor from the pseudo-organization. Entrusting them to get it on their behalf will inevitably be extorted a black fee of 2 or 3 yuan per ticket. For example, if a resident has relatives and friends staying at home today, they must fill out an entry report at the ward chief, paying 2 fen per form. After the curfew at 10 pm, the Japanese army and pseudo-police knock on doors to check the household registration. If the number of people does not match, if there are more people, it can be accommodated, but if one person is missing, the whole family will be escorted to the "department" for interrogation. The reason is that the missing person at night must be out doing dangerous (guerrilla) work, so it must be thoroughly investigated, it is said.

Because their forces are weak, the Japanese side is currently garrisoning only the Zhencheng area and the two and four districts along the railway line. The other districts are all under the control of the guerrillas. The Japanese army only occasionally drives its enslaved pseudo-appeasement team to "purge the countryside" in various rural areas, but the guerrillas are elusive and give the other side a major blow from time to time. The Japanese and pseudo-troops travel back and forth, and the result is only to provide sacrifices. It is said that the pseudo-soldiers commanded by He Chunchao have suffered countless casualties recently. The people's armed forces in the rural areas are also being actively trained and gradually strengthened by the new county magistrate Zhuang, who was appointed by the government.

### Chamberlain's Speech: Striving for International Understanding; Anglo-Italian Relations Are Good; Reasonable Demands Can Be Discussed; Strengthening National Defense Is for Self-Defense

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in his speech at the Birmingham Jewellers' Association last night that without progress in Anglo-Italian relations, he could not have obtained Mussolini's cooperation last September. The outside world has criticized the Munich Agreement and his intention to resolve the behavior that almost plunged the world into an unprecedented tragedy through personal contact. Although these criticisms came from all sides, they had one thing in common, that is, the critics did not bear the responsibility he had, and they did not know the various situations known only to the British government. Looking back, there is neither anything to regret nor any reason to believe that there is a more beneficial path. Modern warfare is extremely terrifying. Not only are those who participate in the war affected, but even those who watch from the sidelines suffer greatly. Therefore, if any honorable methods that are practicable can prevent war, we should not start a war without trying them one by one. The British government has held this view from the beginning. The Munich Agreement is only a casual event in a firm peace policy. He plans to do more than this. He dares to say that the reason why peace was maintained last September was because of the previous causes that had been planted before September, such as the exchange of letters between him and Mussolini in the summer of 1937, and the conclusion of the Anglo-Italian Agreement in February 1938. Recently, his trip to Rome with Foreign Secretary Halifax has been obstructed by people who do not want the safety, friendship, mutual understanding, and willingness to resolve disputes not by force but by discussion that the British and Italian people hold to be realized and criticized greatly. This is not only true in Britain and Italy, but also in France and Germany. We should create friendship between the people of all countries. This can be done by individuals and merchants, not only by official representatives. We should make the other party understand that we do not regard them as enemies, but as human beings just like us. We are always prepared to talk to them on an equal footing, listen to their opinions with an open mind, and meet their reasonable and appropriate desires as much as possible, and on the basis of freedom and justice, not to conflict with the rights of others. Only in this way can we dispel the doubts that poison the international atmosphere and restore the safety of mind and body, and the trust that is the lifeblood of successful undertakings. The achievement of peace requires at least two parties, while the making of war can be done by one party alone. This is what we must not forget. If we do not have a clear understanding to eliminate all kinds of political tensions, then we can only defend ourselves to prevent other countries from attacking our country, people, or the liberalism and democratic country on which survival depends, and which is the foundation of life and spirit. For the sake of self-defense and not aggression, we are now, with the full consent of the people, actively engaged in the reorganization of our military. This takes time, but progress in all aspects is now accelerating. Chamberlain then recounted the progress of the army, navy, and air force in the year before the end of March, saying that by the end of March, 60 new ships totaling 130,000 tons could be incorporated into the navy, and in the 12 months after that, even more new ships would be incorporated into the fleet, totaling 75 ships with 150,000 tons. The air force is also working hard to enrich it. In the past few months, the number of aircraft manufactured has doubled, and the recruitment of air force soldiers has also been successful. Most of the shortcomings found in the British air defense in September last year have now been eliminated. Air defense has been greatly improved, with more anti-aircraft guns and a more stringent air defense team. Chamberlain continued to elaborate on his views on the British National Voluntary Service, saying that if we are indeed caught up in the whirlpool of war, we will see that all the people of the country, even if they are not on the front lines, are practically all on the front lines. To cope with this danger, there is a new opportunity for civilians to serve in civil air defense agencies. We do not want to create a civil air defense team and enlist it in the army as a profession during wartime, thus exempting ordinary citizens from the responsibility of defending themselves. Our job is to find people for a certain job, not to find jobs for the people of the whole country. The government has to spend a lot of time and money to prepare for the war. It is hoped that today is a time to contribute to other countries, because today's atmosphere is full of rumors and doubts, which must not be allowed to exist for a long time. It is those who destroy peace who, as President Roosevelt said in his New Year's message, want to dominate the world by force, which must be rejected by democratic countries. He cannot believe that those who make this request have the intention of challenging, because the consequences of war are extremely serious and no government dares to try it easily. He still believes that any disputes can be resolved through negotiation and discussion, as stipulated in the Munich Declaration, without resorting to war. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)

### Dutch Gold Shipped to America in Large Quantities

(London) With the unrest in Europe, the Dutch currency exchange rate has weakened greatly. At the same time, the amount of Dutch gold transshipped from London to the United States has also increased greatly. Today, about 7 million US dollars worth of gold bars were shipped to the United States by the "Aquitania". There are still seven batches waiting to be shipped, totaling approximately US$65,000,000, which are scheduled to leave the UK completely before February 25. It is said that the weakness of the Dutch currency and the outflow of Dutch gold are related to the dismissal of German Finance Minister Schacht and the rumors that Hitler is planning something. Today, the Dutch currency opened at 8.70 to one pound, and then fell to 8.715, breaking the lowest record since November last year. (Associated Press dispatch on the 28th)

### US Atlantic Fleet Consists of 35 Ships

(Washington) Due to the tight situation in Europe, the US government has decided to permanently station 35 warships in the Atlantic Ocean, including 4 battleships, 8 cruisers, and 23 destroyers. (Associated Press dispatch on the 28th)

140 US warships held large-scale exercises in the Caribbean Sea, which lasted for several days. The first phase of the exercise was to practice shooting, which will end on the 31st of this month. The second phase of the exercise is to defend the American continent, which is about to begin. A large number of warships are currently anchored in this port waiting for orders. According to this exercise, 5 battleships will cruise the coasts of South American countries, and many other warships will sail along the Atlantic coast to New York. At the same time, 80 bombers will take off from Puerto Rico and fly to the Panama Canal Zone to "attack" the canal, which will be defended by the sea and air forces there.

### Chamberlain's Combination of Lenience and Strength: France and the United States Express Welcome, Italian Newspapers Mostly Agree, German Newspapers Also Express Favor

(Paris) The local area expresses welcome for the speech given by British Prime Minister Chamberlain last night at the Birmingham Jewelers' Association, because Chamberlain's firm tone contains a gentle meaning. Therefore, everyone believes that it has the same intention as the speech given by French President Daladier in the House of Representatives recently. Because Chamberlain also wanted to repair relations with Italy and expressed his belief in the possibility of discussions between France and Germany. Moreover, one point coincides with Daladier: the necessity of combining the strength of defense with a firm position to seek peace. The saying in Chamberlain's speech that "Our motto is neither provocation nor obedience, but defense" can fully express the current responsibilities of major democratic countries. Local people also hope that Chamberlain's words that he is willing to ask Germany and Italy to make contributions to peace will be agreed by the other party, and Hitler and Mussolini will respond to it in their future speeches. As for the warning issued by Chamberlain at the end of his speech, saying that all democratic countries must unite to resist any attempt to organize the world by force, and cannot avoid it, the wording is extremely clear. (Reuters telegram on the 29th)

(Washington) People here believe that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham is an expression of Britain's firmer attitude to deal with future international factions. Various circles close to the US government believe that no matter what happens in the future, Chamberlain will always remain optimistic. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini just regarded the fall of Barcelona as a victory for Fascism. It is surprising that the British Prime Minister took this opportunity to swear by the Italian Prime Minister's words. Fascism has won in Spain, and it will threaten Britain and France in the Mediterranean, and France is even in danger of being oppressed by autocratic countries on three sides. The situation is like this, but Chamberlain still does not change his optimism, so everyone deeply hopes that his optimism is not without basis. (Reuters on the 28th)

(Washington) The speech made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain yesterday in Birmingham, England, has been commented on and praised by American politicians. Everyone said that the principle put forward by President Roosevelt in his New Year's address to Congress, that the control of the entire world by violence must be resisted, seems to have been accepted by Prime Minister Chamberlain. Furthermore, Prime Minister Chamberlain's proposal that various democratic countries should unite is especially supported by the American people. In addition, Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in his speech that the British arms expansion plan is now proceeding rapidly. This is regarded here as a warning directly aimed at various autocratic countries, and therefore everyone feels very satisfied. (Havas telegram on the 29th)

(Rome) Italian newspapers have expressed sympathy for the speech made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in Birmingham yesterday, especially emphasizing the section on the British cabinet minister's visit to Rome. Everyone said that this is an expression of peace. Prime Minister Chamberlain is full of realism and can use sincerity to help it, which can be described as rare and valuable. The Roman People's Daily stated that all governments say they want peace, including the French government. This is not a lie, but all the omnipotent countries believe that the conditions related to survival should be met, while other countries advocate maintaining the status quo. In other words, all the omnipotent countries want to establish peace based on justice, while other countries want to establish peace based on a very unfair status quo. This is the difference. (Havas telegram on the 29th)

(Berlin) There are few German newspapers commenting on the speech made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in Birmingham yesterday, but the words all express goodwill. The German General Journal stated, "Prime Minister Chamberlain knows that once a new type of war breaks out, the impact will be unimaginable. Green is to advocate achieving political goals through negotiations. As for his so-called various reasonable wishes, they must be met. We think this is worth considering." The local guide stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech was a defense of the policy he was pursuing, but it is a pity that he did not reveal who was opposed to this policy.

### Ambassador Gu Hosts a Banquet for the New French Ambassador to China

(Paris) Chinese Ambassador Dr. Gu Weijun hosted a banquet at the embassy at noon today to entertain the newly appointed French Ambassador to China, Gosme. French dignitaries, such as Mr. and Mrs. Yachangbo, Vice Chairman of the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives, Admiral Esterware, Inspector General of Naval Education and former Commander of the Far East Fleet, Mr. and Mrs. Heberno, Assistant to the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and former Counselor of the Embassy in China, and Mr. and Mrs. Groluguer, former Ambassadors to the United States and Belgium, were all present.

### Spanish Refugees Flock to France to Seek Refuge: French Authorities Prohibit Strong Men from Entering the Country: US Secretary of the Interior Launches Fundraising for Relief

Bebeini When the border between France and Spain opened at eight o'clock this morning, Spanish refugees poured in. The number was more than before. Most of them had been running around hungry for several days. They looked haggard and pitiful. Then there were rumors that the National Army had landed in Losas Bay. The refugees outside the border were all startled birds and panicked. In fact, the landing statement was not accurate. Only a few National Army warships bombarded Balamos Port. As of now, the villages along the French border are full of refugees, and more are coming in an endless stream. Some even sneaked into the border without going through the border crossing. It was also heard that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Spanish Republican Government, Teldayu, had dispatched several teams of infantry to prevent deserters and government officials from crossing the border into France. In addition, 400 soldiers and civilians wounded by aircraft bombs in various hospitals in the Spanish Group of Girona Province were also transported to the French city of Serbor this morning by several trucks. The French authorities immediately set up a temporary hospital near the station to accommodate them. Various French public groups have set up shelters and provided generous supplies. Even for the refugees outside the border, they also used several trucks to load bread and utensils used by the army to provide food for relief. (Hass telegram on the 28th) Hong Gala There are a large number of refugees from various places in the Catalan Autonomous Region who are gathered here waiting for a train to go to France. All of them are women, children, the elderly, and the weak, carrying boxes and suitcases, looking very embarrassed. The border customs was originally scheduled to stop working at 9:00 p.m. every day, but due to the large number of refugees, they worked all night last night without a moment's rest. Most of the refugees had not eaten for two days, and their anxiety was beyond words. The roads to the French border were filled with cars and trucks, causing traffic jams. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republican Government has now temporarily moved to Girona City to work, and other departments have decided to move to Figueres City. As of now, except for the departments related to national defense, the rest have not been able to return to normal. (Havas telegram on the 28th)

Bebeignon The government recently instructed the border defense authorities on the border between France and Spain to prohibit strong men from Spain from seeking refuge in France, but women, children, the elderly and the weak are not subject to this restriction, because the strong men who remain in Spain can obtain supplies in certain places. As for the Spanish strong men who have entered France, they should be concentrated in certain shelters. (Havas telegram on the 28th)

Bebeignon The French Army authorities decided late last night that any Spanish men of military age who have crossed the border into France may stay in France, but no more will be allowed to enter France in the future. The French army received an order from the government at dusk yesterday that all Spanish men who crossed the border into France and were capable of military service would be sent back to Spain. When the order arrived, some refugees had boarded the train to wait for it to drive inland. The French mobile troops and border guards carried out this order. There were several times when they had to use force to force the refugees to get off the train and return to Spain, but many people tried their best to resist, saying that they would rather die in France than be captured by the National Army. After this order was issued, only Spanish women, children, the elderly and the weak will be allowed to enter France in the future. (Reuters telegram on the 29th)

Bebeignon A group of Spanish government troops, a total of 1,500 officers and men, recently fled across the border into France near Moro today. According to the army's Memory Palace, he told the Havas reporter, "The enemy army has a majority of aircraft and is well-equipped, so our army cannot support it." A large number of Spanish refugees fled to France today in Morandani. Most of them are pale and hungry, exhausted, and many of them are pregnant women. As soon as they enter France, they moan by the roadside, and the situation is very miserable. The French local authorities sent many trucks to transport the refugees to the city of Blue. Many doctors and nurses have also gone to the city to provide treatment. (Havas telegram on the 28th)

Sete About 750 Spanish refugees recently arrived here from their country on two ships and eight fishing boats. After the local authorities confiscated the military supplies on board, they tried to accommodate the refugees. (Havas telegram on the 28th)

(Paris) People from various left-wing parties held a demonstration this afternoon and marched in teams on Qian Tong Street, demanding that the land border between France and Spain be opened to allow military supplies to be transported into the territory of the Spanish Republic government. They were then dispersed by a large number of police and more than 300 people were arrested. Bi Faner, the leader of the "Socialist Workers' and Peasants' Party," was also among them and was immediately released. (Havas telegram on the 28th)

Vatican City People who are difficult to communicate with here recently claimed that Pope Pius XI had sent an application to General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the National Army of Spain, urging him to treat the personnel of the Republican Government with leniency in the occupied areas. (Havas telegram on the 28th)

(New York) Secretary of the Interior Ikes and the local archbishop Coel jointly issued a statement today, calling on the people of the country to donate money to purchase food and clothing to relieve the women and children in the Spanish Republic. The donation should be sent to the "Spanish Civil Country Support Association" organized by all walks of life in the United States, and the association will transfer it to the Paris West National Refugee International Relief Association for distribution.

### Balkan Trends

Capital of Romania Foreign Minister Qiafenge is scheduled to go to the capital of Yugoslavia on February 1 to talk with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the country, Stoja Dinovic. At that time, in addition to submitting the recent visit of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to South Korea for discussion, he will also discuss the agenda of the Balkan Consultation Standing Political Conference (to be held in Rome on February 15). (Havas telegram on the 28th)

Capital of Bulgaria When the House of Representatives discussed the foreign affairs budget today, members of various parties gave speeches, all of which demanded that Bulgaria should recover the areas where Bulgarian minorities live in Romania and Greece. However, the rights of Bulgarian minorities in Yugoslavia should be recognized by the Yugoslav government. It is enough for the matter. Darov, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said that Bulgaria and Turkey have close ties, and all members applauded. Then Prime Minister Gusayfavanov made a speech, saying, "A certain hope, all those that are not suitable for the political reality and the strength of the country, should not be owned by the people of the country." Our country's relations with neighboring countries have improved, so the Thessaloniki Agreement has been established. (According to this agreement, Yugoslavia, Romania, Greece, and Turkey all recognize that Bulgaria enjoys equal rights in military equipment.) Our country also maintains friendly relations with major countries, and at the same time, we should still promote an independent policy and do not intend to accept any restrictions.

### A Very Important Eugenics Issue

— Yang Daonan, Physician, Graduated from the Russian Labor Medical University

On the Pros and Cons of Removing the Gonads

We cannot deny that the current progress of science has indeed grasped the opportunity to improve the human race. For those militaristic countries, their research on eugenics is very active. They do not hesitate to use drastic measures and radical means to castrate citizens who cannot reproduce or have sexually transmitted diseases. In this way, all the people are strong and burly. In the future, can they be commanded as desired when charging into battle?

The advocate of this policy is Hitler in Germany. It is said that it has been quite successful. Any citizen who wants to marry must first go to a doctor designated by the state for a strict examination. If they are found to have venereal infectious diseases and their reproductive function cannot produce strong offspring, they will undergo surgery to remove their gonads.

In order to reduce the drawbacks of this policy when it is implemented, the German government specially formulated a radical law called the "Genetic Disease Abolition Law." It has been implemented for five years. According to this law, hundreds of special courts have been established throughout Germany, and their mission is to determine the punishment of removing the gonads. Unexpectedly, this almost peculiar law has been imitated by Japan today. Japanese parliamentarians also advocate the proposal to remove the gonads, but it was soon placed on a high shelf by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and it has been delayed for a long time. The Ministry of Health and Welfare adopted this wait-and-see policy because there are many drawbacks after its implementation. If it is handled too hastily, it will inevitably be criticized by the public. This is a major matter. If the organization is not good, not only will it not be thoroughly implemented, but it will greatly reduce the birth rate.

According to the opinions of experts from various countries, this law should have the necessity of choosing its urgency and importance. Those who suffer from severe venereal diseases should indeed have their gonads removed. If the health level is only low and the reproductive function is weak, animal youth gland (i.e., gonad) hormones can be used to supplement the human body, which can be fully cured. (Editor's note: Germany has now adopted this method, so removing the gonads is only applied to those who suffer from severe venereal diseases.)

The reason why energy is scattered and sexual function is weakened is entirely due to indulgence and masturbation, so the youth gland loses its prosperity, and symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and impotence follow. If the prosperity of the youth gland can be restored at this time, the above-mentioned symptoms will disappear naturally, so why use the passive strategy of removing the gonads?

German medicine has always been developed and talents have emerged in large numbers. Therefore, the famous physiologist Dr. Merlen proposed chimpanzee testicle sperm and invented the true youth gland hormone, "Body Kang," for men and women. Anyone who suffers from reproductive failure and decreased libido will have the same spring from now on and will no longer have to go on the operating table. This is not only the luck of German citizens, but the gospel of all mankind.

### Choosing the Right Medicine Should Be the First Step in Treating Gonorrhea

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

Medicine is sufficient to cure diseases, but if the medicine is not suitable for the disease, it can kill people. This is like water that can float a boat, but it can also capsize it. The key lies in using it properly and judging it by ourselves. Now I will take the treatment of gonorrhea as an example, and it can be believed to be true. Since the development of science is advancing rapidly, the treatment of gonorrhea is no longer just the speculation of ordinary inferior doctors in the past, sitting in a well and watching the sky. Saying how to treat it is ineffective, and how to treat it is ineffective. For example, in terms of the relationship between chemical therapy and the treatment of gonorrhea, it did not start today, but those who do not know it think that this is the latest treatment for gonorrhea, which is also not true. This therapy started very early, but because there were no doctors with real knowledge and learning (not to mention patients), it was regarded as a sudden rise in treatment. Chemical therapy has made significant contributions to gonorrhea, but it is not for ordinary doctors to speak nonsense and claim it as their own invention. Because inventing a special medicine for gonorrhea is definitely not something that doctors who are busy with diagnosis all day long can get involved in. The invention of a special medicine must be done by real scholars who work tirelessly in the laboratory all day long, and then they may gain something. This can be further proved by looking at Dr. Peter in Germany. Dr. Peter is a modern master of gonorrhea. The "Kelinong" he invented has gone through countless hardships and has a never-say-die heart and the courage to rise again and again. When he used the protein and yellow pigment, two precious components of "Kelinong," he spent endless effort to gradually improve and eliminate bad impurities, and then operated it with scientific methods. After countless animal experiments and clinical experiments by specialized physicians in major hospitals, it finally succeeded. The time spent has exceeded 30 years. Ask how difficult it is to invent a special medicine. It is definitely not something that everyone can claim to have invented.

Therefore, all new and old leucorrhea that has not been cured by other chemical therapies or local surgery, as well as general patent medicines that boast of being able to cure in three or five days, cannot be completely cured, and "Kelinong" can cure them all. It has long been proven by international medical experts that prostatitis, epididymitis, cystitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, etc., are difficult to cure without taking "Kelinong." In short, to solve the leucorrhea that is personally painful, you must first choose a special medicine. Otherwise, it will be difficult to completely eliminate the lingering gonorrhea in my life. Gonorrhea patients should keep this firmly in mind.

### Seeking Good Medicine for Treating Lung Diseases

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

As a doctor and with my actual experience in treating tuberculosis for more than a few years, I deeply know that the lung disease holy medicine "Bufei Nal" has an effect that often exceeds expectations. In treating tuberculosis, it has significant effects on hemoptysis, expectoration, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, reduced appetite, fatigue, night sweats, etc. It is a particularly effective oral medicine for treating tuberculosis. It is especially effective in relieving cough and resolving phlegm. No matter how stubborn the cough is, as long as you take "Bufei Nal," you can relieve the cough within three hours, and it can be completely cured in a short period of time. It is the most reliable oral medicine for preventing tuberculosis when it has not yet developed into tuberculosis.

### Gonorrhea Lecture

— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: Intersection of Ningbo Road No. 9 and Sichuan Road

Strengthen Your Belief in the Treatment of Gonorrhea

It is difficult to cure for a lifetime if you work hard for one day and slack off for ten days.

In the acute stage of gonorrhea, proper treatment is not difficult (this refers to legal and symptomatic treatment). However, patients and doctors often lose the opportunity to cure the disease in the midst of panic during acute gonorrhea. Because patients cannot tolerate the pain to the bone during acute gonorrhea, they cannot help but ask doctors to treat the pain to seek a temporary peace. Doctors also cater to the patient's psychology and do not hesitate to confuse the inherent steps in treating gonorrhea. When the pain of gonorrhea gradually decreases, the patient thinks that this is a good phenomenon that is improving day by day. In fact, this is a symptom of acute to chronic, which is more difficult to treat than acute. Doctors also know this, but they do not say it in their hearts, just delaying the time. Patients often seem lost due to such poor treatment. In the future, they will lose their determination to cure the disease completely, and often work hard for one day and slack off for ten days, which is difficult to cure for a lifetime.

Fortunately, don't indulge in the maze and turn back to the shore.

In my opinion, patients with this type of gonorrhea should strengthen their belief that gonorrhea can be completely cured. At the same time, they should quickly choose a responsible doctor or a special medicine. Then, even if gonorrhea has reached a hopeless state, it is not difficult to recover what has already fallen. In terms of electrotherapy, German static electrotherapy and X-ray electrotherapy can be used interchangeably. Their sterilization power has just the right advantage, and it is also supplemented by the gonorrhea holy medicine "Kelinong" so that cells produce an anti-gonorrhea phagocytic effect after taking it. In this way, even any stubborn and difficult to cure gonorrhea can be cured in a short period of time. I have been in clinical practice for nearly 20 years. Since adopting this therapy, the results of treating gonorrhea have greatly improved. This is not without reason. Clinic hours: 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. From now on, each diagnosis will only cost 5 corners of the diagnosis fee.

### Three Special Emergency Treatments for Spermatorrhea

— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Spermatorrhea can be roughly divided into three categories. The mildest symptom is nocturnal emission, the decisive is spermatorrhea, and the most serious is slippery essence. At this point, it is really not suitable to delay and deceive yourself. You should quickly seek reasonable treatment.

Many people are inherently strong, but after committing masturbation, they become prematurely aging. Therefore, if you only take spermatorrhea medicine without abstaining from masturbation, it can be said to be completely ineffective. At this time, the treatment must be to clear your mind and reduce your desires, and not involve evil thoughts, so that you can abstain from masturbation. Take three tablets of "Body Kang," made from testicle essence, three times a day. It has a good effect on treating neurasthenia, brain weakness, insomnia, and back pain. No matter how severe the symptoms are, it has the magic of reviving the dead. If you feel frequent spermatorrhea or have slippery essence, you should also take "Nais Spermatorrhea Tablets" to stop it immediately.

### European Situation Gradually Unfolding

Hitler to Deliver Speech Today; German Newspaper Comments Advocate for Our Country

(Berlin) Reliable sources here recently stated that when Führer Hitler delivers a speech in the Reichstag tomorrow, he will first discuss the achievements of the Nazi Party in power for the past six years, and then discuss diplomatic events. It is expected to take half an hour to complete the speech. Loudspeakers have been installed throughout the country, and the speech will also be broadcast in the capital of Czechoslovakia and the capital of Slovakia. All schools in Germany will have a day off. The Reichstag has been newly arranged with a total of 22 rows of seats. Government officials and Nazi leaders will sit in the first row, and the 850 members of parliament will sit in the remaining 21 rows. Among the members of parliament, 28 are under the age of 30. The youngest member is a member from the Sudetenland, only 26 years old. Several German members of the Czech parliament have also been invited to attend. Italian Undersecretary of State Farinacci is currently visiting here and will also attend as a representative of Italy. (Havas, 29th)

Paris: As German Führer Hitler is to deliver a speech in the Reichstag tomorrow, observers in political circles here recently expressed the opinion that the evolution of the international situation will depend on Italy's wishes regarding the Mediterranean issue and the assistance Germany can provide in this matter. Although the Italian authorities have unilaterally declared the termination of the Franco-Italian agreement of 1935, they have not yet made any special demands to the French government. From the perspective of the situation in Rome, the Italian authorities will likely wait until the Spanish Nationalist forces have achieved final victory before clearly stating their wishes and initiating discussions, which is expected to happen soon. Since Germany is not the main player in the Mediterranean issue, it is unlikely that Führer Hitler will act as a spokesperson for Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in his speech in the Reichstag tomorrow and explain Italy's wishes on his behalf. As things stand, the views expressed by the Italian side through semi-official channels are not compatible with those of France. In other words, the "rights" that Italy seeks to enjoy in certain places are in conflict with French sovereignty. France has also stated that it will never cede an inch of land, as can be seen from the French National Assembly's discussion of foreign policy on the 26th of this month. At this point, Italian newspapers have repeatedly mentioned the imminent outbreak of war, and the Italian authorities have also called up a batch of reservists born in 1901. Prime Minister Mussolini and Undersecretary of State Farinacci (currently in Berlin) have successively issued strong statements. Responsible officials here are naturally paying close attention with all their spirit. The Chief of General Staff, General Gamelin, extended his visit to various territories in North Africa for this reason. As for the Berlin-Rome political axis, there is no doubt that it has a connected relationship, as can be seen from the fact that the opinions of Italian newspapers are often echoed by German newspapers. However, although public opinion is so strongly advocated at this moment, there are no major diplomatic actions. It is possible that Germany is currently focusing on Central Europe and may not change its course and suddenly move towards the Mediterranean. (Havas, 28th)

(Berlin) As the "Greater German" Reichstag is about to convene, the Nazi Party's organ newspaper, Völkischer Beobachter, recently reviewed Italy's stated desires under the title "Italy and France" and analyzed the possible strategic consequences of an Italian-Spanish alliance in the event of war between Italy and France. The discussion of this issue in the German newspapers is led by the Völkischer Beobachter, which stated: "After the conquest of Abyssinia, Italy formed an axis with a resurgent Germany, and since then, Italy's existence has been filled with its true value and true meaning." Considering the remnants of the ancient Roman Empire, if Carthage (now the French port of Tunis) was not owned by Rome, then the Roman Empire could not maintain the province of Pannonia (an ancient Roman province located along the Danube River, south of Vienna). Similarly, if Italy cannot control the Mediterranean, then even if it wants to retain Central Europe, it is just wishful thinking. History shows that the missions of Germany and Italy in Europe are unique and must be carried out in cooperation. Otherwise, they will not be able to control Western and Eastern Europe and will be controlled by Western and Eastern Europe. Until recently, Italy was active in Africa, but the League of Nations hindered it. When the League of Nations had to end its sanctions, Italy sought further development in the western Mediterranean, which led to a direct conflict with France. France is the Carthage of modern Rome. The ancient war between Rome and Carthage broke out within the borders of Spain. Today, the conflict between Italy and France is the same. Because Spain is located on the shores of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and has colonies in North Africa, it is naturally a valuable ally of Italy. With its help, it can break through the gates of Gibraltar and overthrow France's advantage in the western Mediterranean. Moreover, the Spanish Balearic Islands and Spanish Morocco in North Africa, if deployed by Italy, can cut off direct communication between France and its native African troops and cut off their source. At the same time, Italy will certainly strongly support Spain's various demands on the international neutral port of Tangier, Morocco, and West Africa. This is mutually beneficial in international affairs and is politically just and right. As for French Prime Minister Daladier's inspection of Corsica and Tunisia, it only proves that although the Treaty of Versailles has been repeatedly frustrated in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe, France still cannot fully understand that the "reunification movement" of Nice and Corsica (originally belonging to Italy, ceded to France) will be a barrier to Franco-Italian relations. However, France has failed to understand this. Today's France is gloomy and declining in birth rates, while Italy is full of vitality and fresh blood. It only needs space to develop naturally. France believes in weapons, while Italy believes in combatants. France believes in material things, while Italy believes in spirit. These are the differences between France and Italy. However, Italy can rely on the German-Italian axis on the one hand, and share weal and woe with a revitalized Spain, concluding a military alliance. In addition, the emerging nationalism of Islamic countries can be its backing. All these supports are not to be regretted, and the strength of Italy itself is not even taken into account. Can an eloquent lawyer win a lawsuit, but can he create history?" (Havas, 29th)

Berlin: Führer Hitler issued an order today stipulating that the "Nazi Party's mechanized troops" should become a reserve force for the German army's mechanized units, and should organize specialized schools to train soldiers. In the future, new recruits must be trained in these schools before joining the Party's mechanized troops and practice with various tanks used by the regular army. Retired soldiers of the Party's mechanized troops should participate in exercises organized by the mechanized units on a regular basis during peacetime to maintain their proficiency. (Havas, 28th)

### Earthquake Disaster Area in Chile Extends 4,000 Square Miles

30,000 Killed, Over 60,000 Injured

Chilean Capital: According to news received tonight, the earthquake in Chile has affected an area of 4,000 square miles. At least 30,000 people have died in the earthquake, and 65,000 have been injured. It is the most severe earthquake in South America in the 20th century, and the tragedy is unprecedented. (Associated Press, 28th)

Chilean Capital: Following the violent earthquake that occurred in various parts of southern Chile yesterday, the cities of Chillán and Florida, as well as the three small villages of Quircio, Tomé, and San Carlos, have been completely destroyed. The total loss is estimated to be no less than 1,500,000,000 pesos (Chilean currency). Corpses are scattered throughout the villages of Chillán, and have not yet been cleared, resulting in a foul odor and rampant epidemics. The mayor of that city has requested that the central government issue gas masks to prevent epidemics. The government is making every effort to provide relief to the disaster area, sending food and medicine by plane and ship every day, and instructing the military authorities to be responsible for maintaining order in the disaster area and promoting relief efforts. (Havas, 28th)

### French Finance Minister's Speech: Finances Stable, Gold Reserves Greatly Increased

(Paris) Finance Minister Reynaud delivered a radio address tonight, stating that the fiscal policies he has implemented since taking office have achieved remarkable results, and the franc has become a strong currency. "Of all the currencies in Europe, the franc is the safest." The reason why he implemented a free currency policy and refused to implement an exchange control system is twofold: "First, the situations in Germany and France are different. When Germany previously managed its exchange rate, its short-term debts to various countries amounted to 90,000,000,000 francs. The country's ban on the outflow of funds was tantamount to telling various countries, 'The 90,000,000,000 francs owed to you will definitely be retained.' In France, however, as a creditor country, the amount owed to it is also around 90,000,000,000 francs. If exchange control is implemented, it is tantamount to telling various countries, 'You owe 90,000,000,000 francs, feel free to keep it.' Is that acceptable? Second, the reflux of gold and capital. The Bank of France is the only issuing bank in the world that receives gold every day. For some time, capital reflux has been uninterrupted. If an exchange control system is implemented, there is no possibility of capital reflux. At this moment, France has a huge amount of gold reserves. To illustrate, even the most expensive foreign aircraft, France can buy as many as 5,000 at once. In addition, from January 1 to January 24 of this year, the total amount of savings nationwide was 1,150,000,000 francs, compared to 417,000,000 francs for the entire month of January last year, an increase of nearly threefold. The prices of public bonds in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the Netherlands have fallen by 2 to 4 percent since the end of October last year. The market price of French public bonds has increased on average. Since October 28 last year, various recurring expenses of no less than 12,000,000,000 francs have been fully covered by the national treasury. The financial situation has improved as described above, and there has also been significant improvement in the economic situation, as can be seen from the increase in tax revenue. For example, production tax revenue from December 20 last year to January 20 this year was 421,000,000 francs, an increase of 71,000,000 francs compared to the estimated amount, and an increase of 113,000,000 francs compared to the month from December 20, 1937, to January 20, 1938. The increase in various direct tax revenues is also the same. The production index has increased by 6 percent in two months. For example, steel production in October last year was 511,000 tons, which increased to 580,000 tons in December. The business volume of major department stores in Beijing in November and December last year also increased, which has not been seen for a long time." The current economic policy should be promoted in a "thorough" manner. "We have saved expenses on various civilian public works, and other expenses that are beneficial but not very urgent will be temporarily postponed, and priority will be given to manufacturing aircraft and machine guns. For this reason, although military expenditures have increased, we can still afford it. In short, there is much that can be done in Europe besides resorting to war. A strong France is both calm and determined. Today it is strong enough to resist, and tomorrow it can come out and cooperate. It is hoped that the world can understand this." (Reuters, 28th)

### German Dignitary to Visit Russia; Russia Attaches Great Importance; Germany Still Speaks Vaguely

(Moscow) The news of Schnurre, the chief of the Central European Section of the Commercial Department of the German Foreign Ministry, coming here has been widely commented on by Soviet political figures. However, German figures have a more reserved attitude. It was rumored that Schnurre would come with a large number of attendants and bankers, but it is now known that this is not true. It is possible that the German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, who is currently on vacation in Germany, will return to his post with him. After Schnurre arrives here, he will meet with a certain representative of the Soviet government, but who the representative is and what is being waited for are unknown to the outside world. Sources here only say that Schnurre is a political and economic expert, and the commercial agreement signed between Germany and Yugoslavia was drafted by him and is highly regarded by Führer Hitler. Regarding the statement that Germany will supply the Soviet Union with military supplies, including aircraft and ammunition, German figures here recently stated that Führer Hitler has agreed to supply the Soviet Union with various materials for the military industry, but he is unwilling to supply finished military equipment to "ideological enemies." For this reason, sources said that the Soviet Union has always purchased the most military equipment from the United States. In the future, no matter which country is willing to supply new military equipment, it will be happy to purchase it. However, it is unbelievable that Germany is willing to supply military equipment on the condition that the Soviet Union provides guarantees on its use. It is reported that the Soviet government is currently conducting commercial negotiations with Germany, and is also conducting negotiations with the Polish economic delegation. The Latvian delegation is scheduled to arrive here on the 10th of next month, and the Finnish delegation will also come to Moscow in the near future. In addition, the Iranian representative will also come here soon to sign a commercial treaty with the Soviet government. (Havas, 28th)

### Overseas Chinese Hold Meeting in San Francisco; Prepare to Establish General Propaganda Office

Promote Movement to Amend Chinese Exclusion Act; Raise One Million US Dollars in National Defense Bonds

Continental Report Airmail, San Francisco, January 14: Overseas Chinese on the Pacific Coast recently held an important meeting here to discuss the plan to immediately establish a general propaganda office to disseminate information and achieve effective results. As this news was being sent, the meeting was still in progress, but it was heard that the representatives were very much in favor of this plan. The propaganda office will become an agency for receiving and distributing Chinese propaganda materials on the West Coast of the United States. After its establishment, the central government will not have to communicate with more than fifty overseas Chinese centers in the United States, but only with the propaganda office, which will be able to make contact with overseas Chinese and American groups. It is now proposed to establish the propaganda office in San Francisco, with one resident manager, and if possible, several deputy managers and one secretary. This resolution was made immediately after President Roosevelt sent a message to the 76th Congress on January 4. In his message to Congress, President Roosevelt advocated amending the Chinese Exclusion Act and implementing sanctions against aggressor countries, and one of the purposes of the San Francisco meeting was to discuss ways to promote public opinion in order to realize President Roosevelt's recommendations. Mr. Feng (translation), chairman of the China War Relief Committee in the United States, served as chairman of the meeting. Mr. Zheng (translation), the Chinese Consul in Los Angeles, and Mr. Tolins, director of publicity for the American United Committee to Boycott Japanese Goods, attended and gave speeches. The chairman announced the purpose of the meeting at the first session as follows: (1) To make public opinion support President Roosevelt's proposal to amend the Chinese Exclusion Act; (2) To have Congress pass legislation authorizing President Roosevelt to distinguish aggressor countries and prohibit the shipment of munitions to those countries; (3) To publicize and expand the boycott of Japanese goods; (4) To continue to provide charitable relief to Chinese civilians; (5) To establish a general propaganda office to organize and cooperate in propaganda work on the Pacific Coast. The United China War Relief Association in the United States is the central agency for raising war and relief funds on the Pacific Coast. After the fall of Hankou and Guangzhou last year, the confidence of the Association was inevitably shaken, but due to the unremitting efforts of overseas Chinese leaders in San Francisco such as Mr. Feng and Mr. Tang, as well as the guarantee from the central government and the Guangdong provincial government that the losses in the two places were by no means "sell-outs" but orderly retreats, and that the funds previously remitted to Hankou and Guangzhou had been received correctly, please rest assured, the confidence of the overseas Chinese was restored. Overseas Chinese in San Francisco also launched a movement to raise one million US dollars in national defense bonds. Half of the amount has already been raised after two weeks. Because the Golden Gate Exposition will open on February 18, the overseas Chinese want to end this movement within two weeks so that they can focus on business during the Exposition.

### Yellow River Diverts into Huai River and Enters Jiangsu; Han Guojun and Others Telegraph to Request Closure

Huai Canal Embankment Luckily Has Not Collapsed; Failure to Act Now Will Lead to Eternal Calamity in the Future

Taixian Correspondence: After the breaches of the Yellow River at Huayuankou and Zhaokou in Henan Province, a flood control committee was specially established due to its location at the tail end near the sea. Flood prevention and rescue were carried out in different areas. For four months, the dikes of the Huai Canal and lake were fortunately not breached, and safety was celebrated. However, the affected area was vast, and although repeated telegrams were sent to the central government to plan for closure as soon as possible to cut off the source, it was temporarily difficult to start the closure due to the proximity to the war zone. However, the wheat crops in the affected counties have been lost in vain. The spring plowing season is approaching. If remedial measures are not taken urgently, the consequences will be even more unbearable. Therefore, the authorities have actively drained the accumulated water in the Lixiahe area and organized a dredging project committee for waterways entering the sea. They have also measured the silted rivers in three groups and submitted a request to the central government for a subsidy of 100,000 yuan to complete the project. Local elders in Jiangsu Province, such as Han Zhishi, are deeply concerned and have repeatedly telegraphed to the provincial government to appeal. Yesterday, they sent another telegram to Niu Yongjian and Gu Zhutong to appeal. The two telegrams are recorded below:

Telegram to Niu et al.

To Mr. Niu Tiren, Mr. Chen Guofu, Mr. Ye Chucang, and Mr. Yu Jingtang of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang in Chongqing: Since the Yellow River breached at Huayuankou and Zhaokou, it has diverted into the Huai River and entered Jiangsu, directly heading towards Hongze Lake, crossing the canal and inundating more than ten counties east of the canal. The water depth is several feet on the flat ground. It is already so in winter, and what will it be like when the river floods three times next spring? In the past, the ports returning to the sea were the outlets of the Huai River. As they are farther and farther from the sea, the discharge is extremely small. Now that the Yellow River water has been added, how can they bear it? The counties of Huaiyang will inevitably be submerged into lakes, and will even encroach on the Yangtze River. If the breaches are not quickly closed at this time, a great disaster will be imminent. You are in charge of the government of Jiangsu, care about the old territory, and have always been concerned about the prevention of floods in northern Jiangsu. You should not bear to see this remnant go to ruin. I have already jointly telegraphed the central government, requesting that you earnestly consult with the government to quickly plan for closure and start construction on a specific date to save the people from disaster and avoid a great catastrophe. This urgent telegram is submitted, hoping to receive a reply.

Telegram to Gu Zhutong

This year, the Yellow River breached its banks and diverted east into the Huai River, directly inundating Jiangsu. The dozen or so counties in Huaiyang have been turned into swamps. The extent of the flooding, I trust, is obvious to you. Since the Frost's Descent, the source has become even stronger. In the area around the upper and lower reaches of Liyun, boats travel on flat ground, and the water depth is over several feet. As we approach the severe winter, the accumulated water does not recede. The fields are submerged underwater, and the autumn planting has been missed, and spring plowing will also be missed. If there is no harvest for the whole year next year, the famine and displacement will be unimaginable. Guojun and others have already telegraphed to the National Government and the Executive Yuan, requesting that a senior official be appointed to quickly close the breaches in Mou and Zheng, but due to the current situation, there may be obstacles. We also implore you to consult with experts from the League of Nations to start construction as soon as possible. We have not yet received a reply, presumably because the overall anti-Japanese war makes it impossible to take into account the interests of one corner. However, for the sake of Jiangsu, the corner of northern Jiangsu is of great importance. Now, Chairman Han has repeatedly telegraphed to Guojun, instructing him to organize the dredging project committee for waterways entering the sea in Lixiahe. The ports entering the sea in the lower reaches cannot smoothly discharge the Huai River. How can they discharge the Yellow River? Dredging the tributaries is just a small effort, and the effect is minimal. The fundamental plan is still to quickly close the breaches of the Yellow River. You once governed Jiangsu and witnessed the aftermath of the Huai Canal breach. The subsequent projects were planned and directed by you. Recalling the past is like seeing it now. The Huai River has already caused disaster, let alone the Yellow River. Now, you are leading the old territory from afar and caring for the old land. You should not bear to see this remnant go to ruin. If no action is taken now, the Yellow River will change its course, which may become an eternal calamity. We implore you to telegraph to Chairman Chiang, asking him to consider the people of northern Jiangsu, who are related to the rear support for the anti-Japanese war, and approve consultation with the central government to quickly plan the closure, so that the work can be completed before the peach blossoms bloom, in order to eliminate the Yellow River disaster and save the submerged land. This urgent telegram is submitted, hoping to receive a reply.

### Chinese Army Active in Western Zhejiang; Once Captured Chongtong

Puppet Governor Arrested and Interrogated

Tongxiang Correspondence: Tongxiang is the center of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and is strategically important. Therefore, since its fall, the Chinese army has been unusually active there. It is reported that recently (the 27th), soldiers of the ××th division of the Chinese army set out from the ××th base and launched a full-scale attack on the city. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese army, due to its small force (only one Sugi Team stationed in the county, numbering seventy to eighty people), did not dare to resist and tightly closed the four city gates. Thereupon, the Chinese army concentrated artillery fire to fiercely attack the city gate, eventually destroying the city gate and rushing into the city. The Japanese soldiers then fled in panic along the highway towards Puyuan. The Chinese army fiercely pursued, killing many enemies, and at the same time carried out a major search for traitors in the city. At this time, the county's puppet governor, Mr. Wang, and Fukushima, director of the propaganda outreach office, were about to jump into the river to escape because they had not retreated. They were spotted by the Chinese army and arrested and sent to the ×××th headquarters for disposal that day. It is also known that at about 6 p.m. that afternoon, the Japanese army that had retreated to Puyuan, with the help of reinforcements from Jiaxing, launched a counterattack along the highway. The Chinese soldiers, due to their hasty capture and lack of fortifications, found it difficult to hold their position. Therefore, they fought back on one hand and retreated to their original positions on the other hand. Also, Chongde is a neighboring county of Tongxiang, so when the Chinese army attacked Tongxiang, Chongde was also captured by the Chinese army, but it was abandoned to avoid sacrifices. In addition, in Pinghu, the Chinese army under Liu Jianxu attacked a certain town near the county seat on the night of January 28. The gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls, and all the residents in the city were awakened from their dreams.

### Just Arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, Ma Yuhang Assassinated Yesterday

Shot Dead in the Xinxin Hotel, Suffered Severe Brain Damage

Ma Had Recently Been Appointed as a Councilor by the "Renovation Government"

An assassination occurred at approximately 7 PM yesterday inside the Xinxin Hotel on Guizhou Road in the Public Concession. The perpetrator is still at large. The incident is believed to be politically motivated. Details are as follows:

Arrived from Hong Kong

Around the 26th of this month, a male traveler, appearing to be nearly sixty years old, checked into the Xinxin Hotel on Guizhou Road. His demeanor and speech suggested he was a wealthy and prominent individual. The hotel receptionist led him to a large room, number 605, on the sixth floor, where he would be staying. He registered in the guest book as Cai Jun, from Guangdong, aged 41. When asked about his origin, he stated he was from Hong Kong and claimed he came to Shanghai purely to visit relatives and friends.

Frequent Visitors

In the days that followed, he rarely went out. However, he received numerous visitors daily, mostly high-class guests. As a result, his room was often full of people, and the host was busy entertaining. The hotel staff was attentive and accommodating. Yesterday evening, around 7:30 PM, more than a dozen guests were chatting with the host in his room. At the time, the host was wearing a grey serge cotton jacket, white velvet trousers, and slippers. He was sitting on the sofa chair to the right of the door, holding the evening newspaper, reading and talking with a satisfied expression.

Sudden Gunshot

At that moment, the nearby hotel attendant suddenly heard a gunshot coming from the room. Shortly after, many of the guests who had been sitting in the room rushed out, fleeing for their lives, and shouts arose. The attendants hurried to investigate and found the room empty. The guest named Cai was lying on the floor, covered in blood, still groaning. The attendants were shocked and reported the incident to the front desk, who then informed the police.

Barely Breathing

The Old Gate Police Station, which was nearby, immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives upon receiving the alarm. Our reporter also rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. The tables and chairs in the room were overturned and in disarray. The injured man was lying stiffly on the floor, with blood stains all around. His breathing was very faint. The detectives immediately called for an ambulance, which rushed him to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. At the same time, they searched the room for clues. They found a spent bullet casing and photographed all the footprints and fingerprints in the room, taking them back to the police station for filing.

Succumbed to Injuries

After the injured man arrived at the hospital, the doctors examined his wounds and discovered that the bullet had entered through the left temple and exited under the right ear, completely damaging his brain. Despite all efforts, he succumbed to his injuries and died at 9:45 PM that night. The hospital reported the death to the police, who dispatched detectives to investigate. They found a business card and a travel permit issued to him by the "Renovation Government." Thus, his real name was discovered. The body will be sent to the Jiaozhou Road morgue for examination this morning.

True Name Found

The name printed on the business card was Ma Yuhang. The special travel permit also bore the name Ma Yuhang and was signed by Wen Zongyao, the "President of the Legislative Yuan" of the false "Renovation Government." The occupation field stated "Councilor of the Renovation Government." The reporter recalled that Ma had previously served as a Councilor of the National Government's Military Affairs Commission and was currently a member of the National Government's Resources Committee. It is unimaginable that he would commit this outrageous act; perhaps it is another person. However, after comparing the photos with the real Ma Yuhang, it was confirmed to be the same person.

Brief Biography of the Deceased

Ma Yuhang was from Huizhou, Guangdong, and was 60 years old. He was a Xiucai (successful candidate in the imperial examination) of the late Qing Dynasty. He then entered the Guangdong School of Law and Politics and was a fellow townsman of Chen Jiongming. In 1920, he served as the Director of the Shantou Funding Bureau. In 1921, he served as the Director of the Hainan Island Civil Administration Office, the Director of the Guangdong Finance Department, and the Director of the Economic Investigation Bureau. Since this case occurred, the police have been investigating with all their might. As for the circumstances of the shooting, how the assassin entered, or whether they were among the guests in the room, it is still difficult to analyze and is under close investigation.

The Assassinated Ma Yuhang

### On the Night of January 28th, Chinese Guerrillas Display Their Might

Burned Down the Japanese Headquarters on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, Killed Japanese Soldiers and Captured Cannons

The day before yesterday was the 7th anniversary of the January 28th Songhu Anti-Japanese War. Ding Xishan, the Commander-in-Chief of the Shanghai Suburban Guerrillas, issued a decree to all units to attack Japanese bases on that evening. Political instructors were also dispatched to each unit to participate in the battle. The Sixth Battalion directly under the Eighth Detachment of the Shanghai West Guerrillas also received a secret order from the headquarters to attack the Japanese headquarters at the Shanghai Middle School on the Shanghai-Minhang Road in western Shanghai. This location is a key point on the Shanghai-Minhang and Songhu roads and is the base for the Japanese army in western Shanghai. However, the school buildings are sturdy and the scale is grand, making it difficult to attack. After receiving the order, Battalion Commander Jin gathered more than 400 loyal and brave soldiers and personally led them to march more than 50 miles in the dark to the location. Before the departure, instructors Zhou Qiang delivered speeches. At that time, the soldiers shouted slogans vowing to die, and their voices shook the mountains. The onlookers also raised their arms and shouted. The scene was tragic and impassioned, enough to bring tears to people's eyes. When they reached the destination, the Japanese army was unaware. When hand grenades and shouts of killing erupted, they hastily fought back. At this time, officers and soldiers rushed to the front. More than a hundred Japanese soldiers used cannons and machine guns to bombard the area. The sounds of gunfire and artillery were deafening. After half an hour of fierce fighting, the Japanese soldiers were unable to withstand and fled east onto warships. At this time, the entire team rushed into the Japanese headquarters and poured gasoline on the buildings. The flames soared into the sky, and the Japanese army's food reserves and military supplies were almost completely destroyed. At this time, the searchlights of the Japanese warships in the Huangpu River shone in all directions and fired several cannons as a show of force. The guerrillas, seeing that their mission was completed, retreated in all directions. In this great battle, three Chinese team members were slightly injured, one cannon and several Type 38 rifles were captured, six or seven Japanese soldiers were killed, and countless military supplies were lost. This Japanese headquarters, hated by the people of western Shanghai, was finally completely destroyed. This action not only shows the combat effectiveness, loyalty, and bravery of the Chinese guerrillas, but also makes people aware of the weakness of the Japanese army, and that defeat is imminent.

### Customs Offices Ordered to Ban Transportation of Goods Aiding the Enemy

Totaling Fifty-Four Items Including Tung Oil and Cotton; Ningbo Chamber of Commerce Requests Extension of Implementation

After the Chinese government promulgated regulations prohibiting the transportation of goods aiding the enemy, Article 2 stipulates that any domestic goods that could increase the enemy's strength are strictly prohibited from being transported to (1) enemy countries and their colonies or mandated territories, (2) areas controlled by the enemy through violence. After the Ministry of Economic Affairs designated fifty-four items, including tung oil, customs offices in various locations have been ordered to comply. However, chambers of commerce in Ningbo and other counties in eastern Zhejiang have requested that the customs offices forward a request to the Inspector General of Customs. If cotton, fresh eggs, native paper, tea, and other items are banned, it will greatly affect rural areas. They request a short-term extension of the implementation to allow for relief. The designated prohibited goods are listed below: cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, various wild birds and animals, hides, wool, wild bird feathers, fresh and frozen meats, pig bristles, casings, eggs, salt, rice, grains, wheat, beans, flour, bran, miscellaneous grains, tung oil, raw lacquer, tea, silk and tussah silk, hemp and its products, wood, bamboo, seaweed, rosin, dried chili peppers, cotton and its products, taro slices, thatch, alcohol, dyes, paper, electrical materials and accessories, various metal ores and their products and old waste products, coal, charcoal, kerosene, gasoline, diesel, lubricating oil, lime, bricks, tiles, cement, magnesite, refractory clay, magnesite, dolomite, saltpeter, sulfur, acids, alkalis, alum, gypsum, phosphate rock, arsenic ore, and their products, totaling fifty-four items.

### Postal Remittance Bureau Opens Remittance Services to Border Areas

Including Dihua, Hami, and Other Locations; Air Small Packages Temporarily Suspended

Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, inland transportation has advanced rapidly, and various constructions are also actively underway. Border transportation is becoming smoother. The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, in order to facilitate remittances from all sectors during the Anti-Japanese War, has specially prepared to open remittance services to the border areas. According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency who inquired at the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau yesterday, the remittance services to the following border areas have now begun: Dihua (limit of 800 yuan), Shufu (limit of 3,000 yuan), Hami (limit of 200 yuan), Tacheng (limit of 200 yuan). There are no restrictions on remittances from these locations to Shanghai. It was also learned that the Shanghai Postal Administration recently received a telegram from the Hong Kong Postal Administration, stating that there was an excessive backlog of air small package mail in Hong Kong, requesting immediate suspension of acceptance. The joint mailing group for small packages of the bureau issued a notice yesterday stating, "Regarding the notice, due to an excessive backlog of air small packages in Hong Kong, all air small packages will be temporarily suspended from acceptance starting today. This notice." It is noted that air parcel services to the following domestic locations are available: Wanxian, Chongqing, Chengdu, Luzhou, Xufu, Jiading, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Kunming, Ningxia, Wuzhou, Guilin, Liuzhou, Changsha, and other locations.

### Principal and Interest of Unified Public Bonds to be Paid by Three Banks Starting Tomorrow

Totaling 51,283,000 Yuan; to be Paid in Six Installments in Shanghai in Accordance with the Ministry of Finance's Order

In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has arranged for the Central Bank to advance funds for the principal and interest of the unified public bonds guaranteed by customs revenue, totaling 51,283,000 yuan, which are due at the end of this month. The National Debt Fund Management Committee has issued a notice that the Central Bank and the entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications will start paying the funds tomorrow. The payment method will be carried out in accordance with the regulations set by the Ministry. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired with the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications yesterday and learned that preparations for the payment of principal and interest of the public bonds in Chongqing have begun and are now complete. Payments will begin tomorrow. All payments, regardless of size, will be made in legal tender and not by remittance drafts. However, for the convenience of procedures, small amounts will be paid in cash, and large amounts will be paid by check. Those receiving payments in Shanghai will receive one-sixth of the total amount for the first payment, and the remainder will be paid in five monthly installments of one-fifth each.

### Yongzhen and Other Three Foreign Vessels Forced to Qingdao; Negotiations with Japanese Consulate Immediately

Reasons for Detention Not Yet Clear; Kailing Arrives in Funing Without Unloading Cargo

The Haida, Yongzhen, and other three vessels sailing between Shanghai and Funing were detained by Japanese warships and Qingdao customs patrol boats outside Hexing Town. Yesterday, they reported to Shanghai that they had been forced to sail to Qingdao at 10:00 AM yesterday. Consuls from the British and Norwegian consulates are scheduled to negotiate with the Japanese side for their release today. The Kailing vessel previously test-sailed to Funing. Details are as follows:

Shanghai-Funing Route

In the autumn of 1936, the China United Dock and Warehouse Company, in order to develop the cultivation in the Huaibei area and facilitate commercial transport, attempted a direct route from Shanghai to Funing via the Sheyang River. The Shanghai export journey takes only 40 hours to reach Hexing Town, downstream from Funing. After the war, Chinese vessels were forced to suspend operations, and foreign merchants took the opportunity to send vessels on this route. These include the Kailing vessel of the British firm Luckee Shipping Company, the Yongzhen vessel of the British firm Tong Hing Navigation Company, the Haida vessel of the Norwegian firm Subei Joint Transportation Company, and the Hafva vessel of the Norwegian firm Fucheng Company. Goods from various counties in northern Jiangsu are transferred through this port.

Three Vessels Detained

The Norwegian Haida vessel and the British Yongzhen vessel both sailed from Shanghai to Funing on the 19th of this month. The Norwegian Hafva vessel sailed from Shanghai to Funing on the 23rd of this month. After the above three vessels arrived at Hexing Town in Funing, they unloaded their cargo and prepared to load cargo to return to Shanghai. On the morning of the 26th, Hexing Town was bombed by Japanese aircraft. The three vessels left Hexing Town to return to Shanghai in order to avoid danger. On the 27th, they were detained by Japanese warships and Qingdao customs patrol boats in the Yanghekou waters off the coast and forced to sail north. Negotiations by the shipowners were unsuccessful.

Report Arrived in Qingdao

The Hafva, Yongzhen, and Haida vessels reported to their respective companies in Shanghai yesterday morning that they had arrived in Qingdao at 10:30 AM on the 29th. The reasons for the detention were not mentioned in the telegram. The above three vessels were originally foreign vessels and were not sold to foreign merchants after the war. The cargo they carried did not contain any prohibited items, so the companies were not clear about the reasons for the detention. They have reported to the British Consul General in Shanghai and the Norwegian Consul in Shanghai, respectively. It is heard that the British and Norwegian consuls are scheduled to negotiate with the Japanese side today (Monday).

Kailing Test Sailing

The British Kailing vessel loaded goods such as cloth and cigarettes in Shanghai the day before yesterday and sailed to Funing. At 5:00 PM yesterday, the company received a report from the shipowner stating that the Kailing had arrived in Funing yesterday afternoon and was temporarily anchored outside Hexing Town. The British shipowner, in order to be cautious, telegraphed the Japanese authorities in Qingdao to ask for permission for the vessel to enter and unload its cargo. If permission is granted by the Japanese authorities, it is scheduled to enter Hexing Town to unload its cargo tomorrow morning. It is heard that the value of the cargo loaded on the vessel is one million yuan in national currency.

### Ningbo Garrison Command Prohibits Sailboats from Transporting Smuggled Goods

The Ningbo Garrison Command recently issued a telegram ordering Dinghai and Zhenhai to strictly inspect all sailboats entering and leaving the ports of Zhejiang Province, transporting smuggled goods. The original text roughly stated that there have been frequent incidents of sailboats smuggling goods into the interior for sale through coastal ports in Zhejiang Province, and taking the opportunity to smuggle local products to aid the enemy. Those responsible for inspection have even privately released strong laborers for export. This is a serious violation of the prohibition order. It is stipulated that all inspection units must strictly comply with the regulations in the future.

### Direct Shanghai-Ningbo Route Resumed; Measurement and Registration of Vessels

Moufou, Liangzhou, and Xinanna Vessels all Sailed Directly to Ningbo for the First Time Yesterday

After the Headquarters of the ×th Army Corps recently re-promulgated and amended the Provisional Measures for Navigation in Eastern Zhejiang and approved the resumption of direct navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo, shipping companies are satisfied and are completing measurement and licensing procedures in accordance with the newly revised measures. The Moufou, Xinanna, and Liangzhou vessels all sailed directly to Ningbo yesterday. The Deping vessel will also sail directly to Ningbo tomorrow, no longer detouring. The Modern News Agency reporter has investigated and reported the following:

New Measures, Shipping Companies Satisfied

According to a source in the shipping industry who spoke to the Modern News Agency reporter yesterday, the operation of vessels in the coastal ports of eastern Zhejiang was previously the responsibility of the local shipping administration offices of the Ministry of Communications. Since the outbreak of the war, due to national defense concerns, it has been changed to be controlled by military organs. The military commanders issue orders regarding the blockade and opening of ports, and the orders are frequently changed, making it difficult for shipping companies to comply. The fact that direct navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo was not allowed required detours through Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Taiwan, causing great inconvenience to passenger and cargo transport. Although the Zhejiang provincial authorities readjusted, promulgated measures, and conducted registration, it still failed to address the key issues. Recently, since the promulgation of the amended navigation measures, the content is more realistic and practical. Furthermore, the registration of each shipping vessel must first be measured by the local shipping administration office to check whether the hull is stable. A guarantee of more than one year of operation must also be provided before the license is issued and its operation is approved. The measures are very appropriate and are sufficient to prevent speculation and ensure passenger safety. Therefore, shipping companies from various countries have expressed satisfaction.

Measurement and Registration of Vessels

Since the Zhejiang authorities have thoroughly adjusted shipping and abolished the previously established navigation measures, and separately promulgated the new amended measures, the garrison commands of Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo have issued orders to the local shipping guilds, informing the shipping companies to comply. It is learned that the 48 foreign vessels previously approved for operation on each route (actually only 47 vessels, because Anna and Xinanna were originally one vessel, and after Kaibo sank, there are now only 46 vessels), are preparing to comply with the regulations, and will apply to the Wenzhou and Ningbo shipping administration offices for measurement and inspection of the hull. After obtaining the certificate, they will find two or more guarantor shops, and provide a guarantee of more than one year of operation, before submitting the guarantee to the garrison command for submission to the Headquarters of the ×th Army Corps for review. According to the investigation by the Modern News Agency reporter, after these restrictions, the number of vessels approved for operation will be reduced by at least one-third.

Moufou and Other Vessels Sail Directly to Ningbo

After the direct navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo was approved by the authorities, the Moufou vessel of the German firm Rehder & Co. and the Liangzhou vessel of the British firm Taikoo Dockyard both sailed directly to Ningbo from Shanghai yesterday. The Xinanna vessel of the American firm Wilh. Wilhelmsen, after being released from Ningbo and returning to Shanghai, was originally scheduled to sail to Taiwan and then to Ningbo. Now that direct navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo has been approved, it also sailed directly to Ningbo yesterday afternoon. In addition, the Deping vessel of the Italian firm Sino-Italian Company arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday morning and is scheduled to sail directly to Ningbo tomorrow, no longer detouring through Wenzhou and Taiwan. In the future, transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo will become more convenient.

### Zhang Tuian's Corpse Was Dressed Yesterday

Industrial Groups and Political and Academic Circles Plan to Hold a Memorial Service on a Selected Day

Zhang Tuian, an industrialist from Nantong, passed away on the 26th of this month. His biography has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the dressing of the corpse took place at the China Funeral Home. Mr. Zhang and his elder brother, Mr. Se'an, had been running the Tonghai Industry for many years and had extensive social connections. Guests who arrived that day included Chu Minyi, Wang Dankui, Xu Jingren, Wu Yunzhai, Shen Xinqing, Liu Housheng, Xia Jiancheng, Yuan Bokui, Yu Zuoting, Pan Xulun, Lu Xuepu, Chen Taoyi, Xu Qiufan, Yin Zhiling, Li Qiqing, Zhao Shuyong, and more than a thousand Nantong Chonghai Qigu industry figures and residents. Many sent wreaths and epitaphs, too many to list. Teachers and students from Nantong College and Women's Normal School also came to pay tribute before the coffin. Zhang lived a frugal life. He left instructions that no obituary should be issued and no condolences should be accepted. His son respectfully followed his father's instructions, and the funeral was held in a frugal and simple manner. However, various industrial groups and political and academic circles related to Tonghai, because Mr. Zhang had devoted himself to villageism and had a far-reaching impact, plan to hold a joint memorial service on a selected day to express their condolences.

### Foreign Traders' Houses on Zhoujiazui Island Destroyed by Japanese Army

Past Recreational Place Now in Ruins; Owners Subjected to Unreasonable Treatment During Inspections

The Continental News reported that the war in the Shanghai suburbs has shifted west for more than half a year. Zhoujiazui, where Shanghai residents used to visit on holidays, is still entirely under the control of the Japanese naval and military authorities. Although the foreign owners of the island have made strong protests, the Japanese authorities firmly refuse to return the land and real estate on the island to the owners. Moreover, unless under strict military supervision, owners are not allowed to inspect their property. It is heard that three or four groups of foreign owners were allowed by the Japanese to inspect the island under supervision. Most of these foreigners are members of the Minhang or Shanghai Rowing Club. After returning to Shanghai, they claimed that their houses were dilapidated and desolate, some were completely plundered, and others were deliberately destroyed. According to one owner, the partitions in his villa were taken away, and the remaining furniture was destroyed with heavy objects, apparently with rifle butts. Another owner said that only the four walls and ceiling of his house remained. It is said that after landing, the group was surrounded by Japanese soldiers on foot or on motorcycles, and they were not allowed to look around, but were only led to inspect each house after it had been plundered. Then they were forced to return to Shanghai. It was previously rumored that the Japanese authorities offered certain owners to negotiate directly with the Japanese authorities, rather than through their consulates, and that the Japanese authorities would be willing to pay a certain percentage of the requested compensation. This has not yet been confirmed. However, according to a member of the Foreign Real Estate Owners Association on the island, no member of the association can agree to this. Although negotiations have begun to return the property on the island to foreign owners, diplomatic circles believe that all negotiations regarding foreign rights and interests in China are extremely unsatisfactory. British, American, and French authorities in Shanghai and Tokyo have recently made requests and strong protests to the Japanese authorities, but to no avail. Some foreign owners on the island believe that the Japanese authorities are attempting to force foreigners to leave the island in order to establish a large-scale naval and military base there. Some foreigners who have visited the island agree with this view, as there are many Japanese troops stationed on the island.

### On the Removal of Gonads: The Necessary Nourishment and Supplementation of Gonads

Reuters, Tokyo, 24th – According to a telegram, two members of the Minsei Party criticized the Ministry of Health and Welfare for being overly cautious and slow, failing to achieve satisfactory results in the near future. Therefore, they plan to propose a bill to remove gonads in their impeachment. They believe that this case is an urgent necessity. A member who initiated the case said: This term sounds horrifying, but men can return to work soon after the necessary surgery, and women only need to rest for two or three days...etc. Since Japan launched the Sino-Japanese War, its domestic situation has been one of poverty and exhaustion. This is known to anyone with a bit of foresight. However, using gonad removal as a remedy only serves to quench thirst with poison.

The reason humans have gonads is similar to plants having flower buds, and animals having testicles and ovaries. If we want to enjoy their branches and leaves, and make them particularly lush, we can remove the flower buds to make their growth exceptionally vigorous. There is also a method of castration for animals to fatten them, because our current purpose is for meat consumption. Such as the castration of chickens, ducks, cattle, and sheep for meat. In addition, there is also eugenics. For example, if a particular species is inferior or has a disease, and we do not want it to reproduce, we remove its genitals or pluck its flower buds to eradicate its reproductive function, so as not to pass on flawed genes. Although this method has been used in plants and animals, its application to humans is still controversial. Because humans are the most intelligent of all creatures, with higher functions such as intelligence, emotion, and will in addition to life, who should prosper the race? Who should be deprived of happiness? This standard is difficult to determine. Moreover, today's Japan, due to economic hardship, wants the people to focus on work, and uses gonad removal to remedy the situation. This is simply a desperate and absurd measure. However, we are unfortunate to be born in troubled times, or perhaps fortunate to be born in this great era. Due to environmental pressure or voluntary courage, in any case, we must not give up our happiness, and our work efficiency must be increased in order to cope with the current difficulties and achieve something. But our energy is limited, how can we achieve this goal? In the 20th century, the medical community has already invented effective methods to nourish and supplement gonads. The historical facts of its invention cannot be described in detail in this article due to space limitations. We can only briefly say that it has been possible to extract gonadal hormones from strong animals similar to humans, such as apes, orangutans, cattle, and sheep, and refine them into a preparation called Stan's "Gonadal Hormone" (medicines for men and women, sold in all pharmacies). After taking it, it can indeed produce sperm and nourish the kidneys overnight, and nourish the gonadal function to make it healthy. At the same time, it is effective on blood, muscles, brain, nerves, and various endocrine glands, enhancing their function. Therefore, if you continue to take it, you will definitely be able to increase your energy in a short period of time, eliminate diseases, make your body healthier, increase work efficiency, clear your mind, and revitalize your youth, achieving the effect of rejuvenation. Men who suffer from weakened reproductive function due to early masturbation and spermatorrhea, or indulgence after marriage, polygamy, or excessive work, excessive use of the brain, or congenital weakness, or imbalance after illness, resulting in frequent nocturnal emissions, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, kidney deficiency, short genitals like fingers, premature aging, brain decline and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, sallow complexion and emaciation, mental depression, and infertility after prolonged marriage, then taking this gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadal Hormone" is the most effective and specific remedy, without failing to achieve the effect of curing the disease. However, those who have nocturnal emissions must also take "Hymitol's Sperm-Stabilizing Pills" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, which will be even more effective. However, if patients can come to our clinic in person for diagnosis by expert doctors and use other latest therapies such as electrotherapy, injection, and surgery, cure can be guaranteed.

Common Diseases of Youth

### The Evil Consequences and Salvation of Untreated Spermatorrhea

— Venereal Disease Specialist Physician Zhan Nianceng

In Mr. Zhu Bolu's family precepts, there are two sentences, "Prepare for rain before it comes, and do not dig a well when thirsty" to teach his descendants. I believe that the meaning of these two sentences has unique merits in human eugenics and social evolution.

We are not talking about anything else now, but just about the academic skills that he will rely on to make a living in the future. Suppose a student, in the era of middle school or university, does not work hard on weekdays, only knowing to go to some places to play when there is a chance. Or, even if he is in class, his eyes are not on the books at all. When the exam period comes, he thinks to himself that it is impossible for my studies to pass, but how can I face my parents' expectations if I fail? So he is anxious and rushes to work hard, but is this kind of work hard when thirsty still timely? (As for those who are not ashamed and not anxious, such people are not worth discussing).

There is also a kind of young man who does not know how to cherish himself. He does not have a full understanding of the physiological structure, and he does not know how to cherish the value of health. He only indulges in temporary joy, or for a moment of impulse, he does not hesitate to damage his health, or he sleeps with prostitutes, or he indulges in masturbation. Masturbation and indulgence are the most harmful actions to the youth glands, so the sperm gate is relaxed, and there is spermatorrhea. Weak brain and insomnia, kidney deficiency and incompetence, incomplete development, tinnitus and palpitations, and various phenomena of neurasthenia throughout the body. This is a body equal to a "broken bowl" with problems everywhere, but at this time, he is still not afraid, procrastinating and lingering. When the essence is exhausted and the blood is exhausted, he is almost seriously ill and begins to worry and seek help. Even if he is lucky enough not to die, it is already very difficult!

In summary, I believe that no matter what you do, you should have some preparation beforehand, and for diseases that can hinder health, you should always take precautions. If you have unfortunately suffered from spermatorrhea, you must seek medical treatment as soon as possible. As for the method of treatment, on the one hand, you must be pure in heart and have few desires, and strictly observe health preservation. On the other hand, you must use "Bumitoll's Sperm-Stabilizing Pills" to consolidate your spiritual gate, so that spermatorrhea can be stopped that night, and you will not cause future troubles again. Those who have caused incomplete development, kidney deficiency and impotence, pale complexion, and emaciation due to excessive leakage should also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadal Hormone" at the same time to nourish their sperm and blood, revitalize their youth glands, and promote metabolic function. If it can be rescued in time, why should there be a sigh of "digging a well when thirsty"?

### Key to Female Beauty

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

As the saying goes: "Is it possible to climb a tree to catch fish?" Beauty, although eagerly pursued by every woman, seeking it in makeup is like climbing a tree to catch fish. So no wonder there are more ugly women in the world and fewer beautiful ones! Then how will women pursue beauty? This must be considered from the root of the female body. Female beauty must be based on the development of female characteristics. The development of female characteristics is necessarily based on the healthy ovarian function physiologically. If the ovarian function is healthy, the breasts will first have good development, presenting a high and elastic state. The hip bones are enlarged, and the buttocks also show development, which forms the most secret curve of female beauty in the figure. At the same time, the metabolic function must also be quite vigorous, so the skin, muscles, blood, and endocrine glands are filled with new cells, so the skin is naturally white and tender, the muscles are naturally plump, and the blood is naturally bright red. The bright red complexion is revealed on the white and tender skin, coupled with a warm smile and a graceful posture. Is this not a heavenly maiden? Men who have such a wife will naturally be deeply in love and have endless affection, and will not say "domestic flowers are not as fragrant as wild flowers". Such a husband is of course so happy, and such a woman is so glorious! Therefore, truly beautiful women will never pursue it in makeup. If a woman suffers from hidden diseases such as irregular menstruation and leucorrhea, the ovarian function will be destroyed, and the metabolic function will also be reduced. Therefore, the breasts are shriveled and the face is衰, such women, even if they are covered with makeup, are only enough to show their hypocrisy and ugliness. If smart women, they must find a way from the root, that is, take ovarian preparation female "Gonadal Hormone" to nourish the ovarian function to make it healthy, and promote metabolic function to make it vigorous, then the above symptoms can be completely cured, and can make the breasts rise, the cheeks rosy, and increase the natural and precious beauty.

### Fortunately, I Jumped Out of the Trap of Spermatorrhea Today

— Chen Ziwei of Mintinein Road ××× Cotton Shop

Really fortunate! I, today, am like seeing the blue sky after clearing the clouds, and I jumped out of this trap of spermatorrhea. But after thinking about it, I feel that the power of famous medicine cannot be reduced. There is a need to sincerely inform the readers here!

I am twenty years old this year, and I have suffered from spermatorrhea for five years. In the first year of its first occurrence, the number of times was small, and people did not feel any fatigue, so I didn't take it to heart at all. Until the winter of my third year, when I was eighteen years old, I was transferred from the Suzhou branch to the Shanghai head office. The work was complicated, and the contacts were all women, so the symptoms suddenly increased sharply. Almost every one or two days, there must be nocturnal emissions, sometimes two or three times a night. At this time, I was slightly afraid, but due to economic constraints, I finally did not resolutely seek medical treatment. Time passed, and a year passed in a hurry. Until last autumn, spermatorrhea turned into spermatorrhea, and it would automatically flow out during the day. At this time, the pain in the body and mind, and the fatigue of the limbs, are simply indescribable. Knowing that if this continues, not only will my career be shaken, but I am afraid that I will have no happiness to enjoy after marriage in the future. So I could not wait, and bought half a dozen spermatorrhea medicines from a large pharmacy, thinking that I had spermatorrhea, and taking spermatorrhea medicines would of course be effective. I didn't know that after taking four boxes in a row, the symptoms remained the same. After taking half a dozen, the spermatorrhea did not get better, but instead caused headaches, brain swelling, and mental restlessness. In this situation, I really could not bear it, so I bought two boxes of "Hymitol's Sperm-Stabilizing Pills" and two boxes of "Gonadal Hormone" from Wuzhou, and took them at the same time according to the guidance of your publication, to see if they were effective? I knew that one attempt was beyond my expectations. After taking two boxes, the spermatorrhea had stopped, and after taking four more boxes, the spermatorrhea was also cured. Now I am strong and energetic, and my demeanor is free and easy. I have washed away the previous wilted state. In addition to being gratified, I recorded it to inform the fellow sufferers.

### Ministry of Finance Increases Appropriation of 30 Million Yuan for the Foundation for Purchasing Local Goods; Total of 80 Million Yuan to Be Handled Jointly with the Trust Bureau, etc.

After the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance successfully adjusted foreign trade, the overall import surplus decreased, and exports of local goods increased after the war. In order to purchase major local goods across the country, such as tung oil, bristles, tea, leather, silk, etc., the Ministry of Finance has specially allocated another 30 million yuan in funds, plus the previous 50 million yuan, for a total of 80 million yuan, to be handled jointly with the Central Trust Bureau, China Vegetable Oil Company, China Tea Company, etc.

### Shanghai Municipal Council 1938 Report of the Volunteer Corps

Although the war in Shanghai stopped the year before last, the social situation has not yet recovered. The "B", "C", and "D" defense lines in the concession are still guarded by foreign troops. Therefore, the members of the Volunteer Corps only replaced the British army in the "B" area for defense once in August. The remaining duties were only to assist the patrol or maintain the internal security of the concession at the request of the commanders of various defense zones. The corps was ordered to dispatch on the anniversaries of July 7, August 13, September 18, and October 10 last year due to the tense situation, assisting the patrol and foreign troops to prevent riots. The measures taken were quite effective.

The various teams of the Volunteer Corps gathered for exercises once a month, and resumed target practice shortly after the target range was opened. As a result of negotiations by the commander of the "A" defense zone, the road leading to the target range was opened from March 3, allowing members of the Volunteer Corps to pass.

Between June 13 and August 8, the patrol of the concession requested the Volunteer Corps to dispatch armored car teams to patrol south of the Suzhou River twice a week, from 5:30 pm to 11:00 pm.

The patrol of the Volunteer Corps has two types: armored car patrol and armed military vehicle patrol. The patrol and the commander of the "C" defense zone often request the Volunteer Corps to send armored cars to patrol within their jurisdiction to assist. The members of the Volunteer Corps on the armed military vehicles are more convenient for entertaining their duties when maintaining security. Therefore, these vehicles often depart with armored cars in order to suppress riots. The results are quite good. The effectiveness of armored cars has improved even more after the installation of wireless telephones. News broadcast by the patrol can be quickly transmitted to armored cars equipped with this type of telephone. Therefore, when needed, the members can immediately rush to the scene of the incident.

The training course of the Volunteer Corps has been completed in eight types. The commanders of the British and American defense forces stationed in Shanghai have strongly assisted in the training. The Volunteer Corps is very grateful.

The training of the Russian team is the same as in previous years. However, the training of newly recruited members is hindered due to the lack of available enemy troops. From August 12 to 14 last year, the team was ordered to carry out actual mobilization, and the results were of great benefit to the security of the concession. On weekdays, the team cooperated with the patrol from time to time to carry out duties such as suppression, search, and guard. The team members have good discipline and good health, which is very satisfactory. The accommodation problem of the team will be a lot of consideration in the future. Now the members are divided into two houses owned by the Chinese government, which is not very economical. The total number of members of the Volunteer Corps increased by 54 last year. The most members are now British, except for the Russian team, followed by Russian, Chinese, American, Portuguese, and Japanese. Around the anniversary of August 13 last year, three teams were fully mobilized.

The defense of the "B" defense zone has been taken over by the British army. At the same time, the Russian team of the Volunteer Corps has a specialized duty. Therefore, all the military vehicles of the team have been temporarily reduced by two. Some of the vehicles are too old and will need to be replaced in the future.

All rifles have been improved and are stored in the headquarters. All machine guns stored in the headquarters are good.

There are many members who have to retire due to their high age this year. Therefore, the commander of the team has paid attention to the recruitment problem.

Last year, the Volunteer Corps coordinated with foreign troops and the patrol to maintain security, making the situation in the concession more peaceful. Therefore, the value of its service cannot be obliterated. It can be asserted that this kind of service will still be needed in the future.

### Japanese Side Receives Foreign Journalists; Answers Are Vague; All Answered with "No News"

The China Press reported that at yesterday's (27th) reception for journalists by the Japanese side, the journalists asked various questions, and the answers received were all "no news." Regarding the rumors that "Shao Lizi" was kidnapped by the Japanese in the public concession, the spokesperson replied, no news. Whether the Panamanian ship Yongda, which was detained in Qingdao on December 31 last year, will be released tomorrow, the spokesperson again replied no news. It is rumored in this port that guerrillas captured the village chief in Weihaiwei to prevent them from assisting the Japanese army in recruiting Chinese people. The spokesperson also replied no news. The journalist asked again whether the Japanese military special affairs department would be taken over by the Asia Development Board. The spokesperson replied maybe yes, maybe no. The journalist also asked why Chinese people were blocked at the bridgehead and searched when entering and leaving Hongkou, causing traffic jams for up to 20 minutes. The spokesperson Zhu did not answer, and finally said that it was because leaflets about the anniversary of the January 28 Incident were distributed on the south bank of the Suzhou River, so preventive measures were taken.

### Woman Who Advertised for Marriage Has Many Romantic Affairs in Her Life; Case of Accusing Husband of Enticement, Rape, and Injury Has Been Tried and Scheduled for Sentencing; Defendant Will Also File a Lawsuit

Cheng Ying, a woman from Changshu, is 25 years old. She received higher education and graduated from Cihang Midwifery School. She was previously married to Dr. Wei Guangcai. The wedding hall was set up in the New Hotel on Erma Road, and their cohabitation location was at No. 14 Fude Lane, Hed Road. Unexpectedly, the marriage was short-lived, and they divorced. Cheng then published an advertisement for marriage on a local newspaper on September 6 and 7 of the year before last. The only qualification was that the man could bear the economic burden. At that time, Zhao Liyuan, a native of Jiangyin, owner of Liyuan Well Company at No. 596 Haifang Road, went to apply.

After negotiation, it was considered that he met the qualifications, so they began to cohabit. Unexpectedly, after more than a year of cohabitation, a rift suddenly arose. Recently, Cheng suddenly hired lawyer Shen Yiqian to file a criminal lawsuit with the First Special Court against Zhao Liyuan, accusing him of using fraud to entice her to rape, injure her body, and impede her freedom, etc. The Special Court has already interrogated him once, and the defendant has also hired lawyer Shen Ronghua to appear in court on his behalf. The court ordered that the trial be rescheduled. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The case was continued in the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning by Judge Xiao Peishen. The plaintiff invited the same

witness to court

to prove that the defendant had injured her. The defendant completely denied all the accusations made by the plaintiff and stated that this matter was not an enticement of the defendant, but a solicitation by the defendant in response to the newspaper advertisement, so the defendant was actually a deceived person. His representative lawyer Shen Ronghua submitted small newspapers such as "Holmes" and "Diamond", and the plaintiff and Dr. Wei Guangcai's

wedding photo

to the court. The small newspapers contained mostly various scandals about Cheng Ying in the past, which are too numerous to mention. The most notable of them was the incident of Tao Jianhua, the former intelligence section chief of the Military Affairs Commission and concurrently the inspector general of the Jiangsu Anti-Smoking Bureau, encountering a female con artist Cheng Yanbai escaping. It is recorded as follows, saying that Yanbai's original name was Cheng Ying, and she used aliases such as Cheng Ying, Ru, Tongyun, etc., more than ten in total, and

she was already 29 years old

She had relationships with Xu, the secretary of the Jiangxi Civil Affairs Department, Liang, the president of the court, Wu, the magistrate of Xingzi County, and Lu, the staff officer of the Fujian Pacification Park. She also worked as a mistress three times in Shanghai. Marrying Tao Jianhua was her ninth husband. Later, Cheng took Tao's marriage certificate and jewelry and fled Shanghai on the 15th, and married Dr. Wei Guangcai at the New Hotel on the 20th. After Tao reported to

the authorities,

it was found that Cheng had fled with property. He negotiated with Cheng, but Cheng took the marriage certificate and suitcase and escaped again. Later, Wei found Cheng at the Ningbo Merchants Hotel on Tianjin Road and twisted her into the patrol, and Cheng handed over the marriage certificate and other items. Then, she divorced Wei, etc. The defendant's lawyer stated that this evidence was delivered to our lawyer's office by someone during the rescheduling. He requested an inquiry. Judge Xiao then asked the plaintiff, how many times

have you been married?

Cheng admitted that she had married Wei Guangcai once, and denied the rest. Later, because Wei committed a criminal case, she broke away from him, etc. The court stated that the case was clear and ordered the debate to begin. After the plaintiff and defendant lawyers debated each other, the court ordered that the verdict be announced at a later date. It is also heard that the defendant will also file a lawsuit against Cheng Ying.

### A Fire in a Shantytown on Tokyo Road; Multiple Fatalities; More Than a Hundred Thatched Cottages Were Burned; Tragic Scenes of Weeping and Wailing

The shantytowns in western Shanghai are where common people live. Recently, fires have been heard from time to time. At 12:20 noon yesterday, a fire was reported in the thatched cottages near the Tokyo Road and Jilao Road in western Shanghai's Public Concession, and several people were burned to death. The situation was very tragic. The details are recorded as follows.

A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire

There are more than a hundred thatched cottages there. At noon yesterday, one of the shacks accidentally started a fire while cooking lunch, causing a single spark to start a prairie fire. At that time, due to the oblique wind and drizzle, the flames became even fiercer. The residents there supported the old and helped the young, weeping and wailing. Later, the Central Fire Department was notified and immediately dispatched six fire trucks to rush to the scene to put out the fire. Because the thatched cottages there were close together, it was difficult to put out the fire. It took more than two hours to extinguish the fire. It is estimated that more than a hundred thatched cottages were burned down.

Many People Burned to Death

Due to the narrow paths in and out of the houses, even though the fire broke out during the day, several people were still buried in the fire. The firemen found the bodies of a boy and a girl. In addition, there were two bodies, which were charred and unidentifiable. In addition, women Lin Chen (56 years old) and Wu Lin (34 years old) were burned in the head, face, and hands and were sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment by car. As for whether there are any other people buried in the fire, the digging was still continuing last night. As for the victims, they were still standing outside the fire scene, in dire need of relief.

### The Sixth Session of the French-Chinese Charity Lottery Will Be Drawn on the 3rd of Next Month; Winners of the First Prizes in Previous Sessions Were All Chinese and Foreign Businessmen in the Concession

The sixth session of the French-Chinese Refugee Relief Charity Lottery will be drawn publicly at Yizhang Hall at 2:00 pm on February 3, rain or shine. There are only four days left before the draw. The lottery has a good reputation, and gentlemen and commoners from all countries in Shanghai are very enthusiastic about buying tickets. Moreover, this session is drawn in advance, just to use the opportunity to win a prize to allow ticket buyers to spend the New Year comfortably. Therefore, sales are strong, and there are not many tickets left. You must buy tickets as soon as possible, otherwise it is inevitable that you will miss out. The winners of the first prizes in previous sessions, street vendors and bathhouse masseurs, both rescued refugees and made profits for themselves. It is indeed a good deed that serves multiple purposes.

### Counterfeit Cigarette Factory Convicts Criminals

Personnel from the Public Concession Patrol discovered a dyeing workshop that counterfeited cigarettes produced by the British American Tobacco Company on Wuding Road on New Year's Day this month, and arrested 25 bandits on the spot. More than one million counterfeit Great Britain, Pin Hai, and Old Dao brand cigarettes were found in the counterfeit factory. All the bandits have been detained in the Central Patrol for a long time. The First Special District Court has now sentenced eight of them to six months in prison, and some have been fined from 30 to 300 yuan. It is heard that the Public Concession has been paying attention to the counterfeit cigarette factory for several years, and it was only cracked during the New Year's holiday this year.

### Newsboys Save Money for Disaster Relief; Saving Others Is Saving Oneself; Receives Assistance from All Sectors

The Newsboy School, jointly run by the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association and Shen Bao, has been established in ten schools, with more than 500 students. The teaching is serious on weekdays, and there is life guidance, and the teaching results are excellent. They automatically initiated a practical thrift movement, saving at least one cent per person per day. In November, a total of 55 yuan and 49 cents was saved. In December, a total of 65 yuan and 86 cents was saved. The amounts for each school were: School 1: 5 yuan and 1 cent, School 2: 10 yuan, School 3: 5 yuan and 2 cents, School 4: 10 yuan and 50 cents, School 5: 5 yuan and 1 cent, School 6: 5 yuan, School 7: 5 yuan, School 8: 8 yuan, School 9: 7 yuan and 9 cents, School 10: 5 yuan. People from all walks of life, seeing that the newsboys themselves have extremely difficult lives, can still save so much money in a month, which is greatly admired. Sun Ruihuang, Xu Xiaochu, Ye Gongshan, and other gentlemen each donated 10 yuan, and the People's Industrial Cooperative donated towels, the China Chemical Works donated soap and toothpaste, and the World Book Bureau donated books, which were distributed to the newsboys. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will give more assistance, which will greatly benefit the newsboys.

### 1938 Labor Report of the Public Works Bureau (Continued)

(Wage Changes Before and After August 13th) Based on the two tables above, comparing the wage situation of various industries before and after the war, the post-war wages are obviously lower than the pre-war wages. This decline is even more significant in actual income figures. The underwear, enamel, and hosiery industries suffered the most severe wage reductions after the war. On the one hand, it was due to transportation blockades and a sharp decline in sales in the inland areas. On the other hand, because most of the larger factories in these industries were shut down after the war, and the remaining smaller factories had originally lower wages. A few industries, however, experienced wage increases after the war. For example, the hourly wage rate in the cotton spinning industry was 3.9 cents in the 25th year, and the actual monthly income was 10.05 yuan in the 25th year and 13.3 yuan in the 27th year. The increase was due to the sharp increase in the population of Shanghai and the urgent need for cotton textiles, which led to the booming of the yarn industry and increased employment of skilled workers, thus increasing wages. At the same time, the manipulation and price increases in the cotton spinning market caused yarn prices to soar, which undoubtedly had an impact. The wages in the silk and cotton weaving industries also increased. The increase was actually due to the booming of the silk and cotton weaving industries in the months before the war, when there were many requests for wage increases. Although affected by the war, the wages had already increased. In the 27th year, there was a slight decline, but due to the increase in population and the wide range of clothing uses, the wages were still higher than in the 25th year. The reeling industry was severely affected by the outbreak of the war. Most of the industry fell into the war zone, and the remaining factories were sometimes operating and sometimes suspended. However, due to the gradual increase in exports after the war, the reduction in output, the high price of silk, the business gradually became active, and the wages also returned to the old view. Recently, due to the lack of skilled workers, factories are competing to attract them with high wages, and wages are becoming more and more high. The wages in the flour industry have always been calculated on a monthly basis, so there were no major changes before and after the war. As for the oil pressing and paper making industries, the oil pressing industries that started after the war had more than enough power. Only two companies, Dade and Xin, were in operation. Only one paper making company, Jingcheng, was in operation. Since the scope of the investigation was not widespread, it was difficult to compare with the pre-war figures. Although there were gains and losses, it was not enough to be used as a conclusion.

(Daily Working Hours) In the following table, each industry is arranged according to the average actual daily working hours. The longest working hours are in the cotton spinning, flour, cotton weaving, oil pressing, and paper making industries, which work between 11 and 12 hours a day. The working hours in the tobacco and match industries are shorter, between 6.5 and 8.5 hours. It is worth noting that the cotton spinning, flour, cotton weaving, and silk reeling industries have the lowest wage rates and the longest working hours. With long hours and low pay, the situation of the workers in these industries can be imagined. The length of working hours changes with the prosperity and decline of business. During the period from the 20th to the 24th year, when industry and commerce were in decline, all industries experienced extreme difficulties. Therefore, they reduced work and restricted exports. This situation had a significant impact on working hours, especially for piecework. Piecework is paid according to the amount of output. In an environment of industrial decline, piecework is the first to be affected by reduced work opportunities, so the change in working hours for piecework is more drastic than that for hourly work. In industries that employ a large number of pieceworkers, the average working hours are often shorter than those in industries that employ hourly workers.

(Monthly Working Days) Among the various industries, the flour industry has the most average working days per month, with 29 days per month, and the oil pressing industry has 28 days per month. There is almost no time to rest in a month. The silk reeling, hosiery, machinery, tobacco, and printing industries have fewer working days, with between 18 and 26 days per month. In some industries, especially in matches, tobacco, and silk reeling, the number of working days in each month varies greatly. Changes in weather and shortages of raw materials are the main reasons for the intermittent work. Since the work is not fixed, the income is also fluctuating, and the lives of workers cannot have a fixed guarantee. In theory, the daily output can be adjusted. This is a matter of factory management. If there is intermittent work, the factory authorities cannot shirk their responsibility. The number of working days in the 27th year of the Republic of China has increased significantly compared with the previous year, which is enough to indicate that the Shanghai market has experienced abnormal development after the war. In the silk reeling industry, the actual income of workers in the 26th year was an unprecedented low.

(Trend of Real Wages) The real wage index can show the actual situation of workers' lives. If income increases and living expenses decrease, then life is comfortable. Conversely, life is difficult. Therefore, the quality of workers' lives depends on the degree of rise and fall of both. In the 26th year, the actual income index fell sharply, and living expenses rose sharply. The two went in opposite directions, and the real wage fell from 103.96 to 81.27. In the 27th year, although the actual income increased slightly, the situation did not improve. The living expenses index suddenly increased from 106.27 to 137.51. The real wage continued to fall to 62.81. From the rise and fall of the real wage index above, we can see a glimpse of the difficult life of workers during the war. (End)

### The National Government Develops the Economy of the Southwest: A Complete Plan Exists; Preparation for the Northwest is Underway; Mr. Du Yuesheng Works Hard to Promote It

Mr. Du Yuesheng and Mr. Wang Xiaolai, in response to the call of the central government, went to Yunnan, Chongqing, and other areas via Hong Kong to inspect industries. In the middle of this month, the inspection was completed and they returned to Hong Kong from Hanoi. According to Mr. Du, who told the Hong Kong-based reporter of the Xin Sheng News Agency, the impressions gained from this trip to the west were excellent. The authorities were able to devote themselves to construction projects during the war, and various light and heavy industries had been moved to safe locations to continue their production work. This kind of place can especially show the great spirit of perseverance and hard work of our people. Mr. Du expressed his respect for the current Minister of Economic Affairs, Mr. Weng Wenhao, saying that Mr. Weng was able to use pure scientific management methods to enable Chinese industry to quickly embark on a new track and establish a new system from the collapse. This could not be achieved without great intelligence and agile means. Mr. Du also said that the rich resources of northwestern and southwestern China, with a little development, would be sufficient to support the long-term war of resistance. The central government has a complete plan for developing the economy of the southwest, and the northwest is also in the planning stage. Finally, Mr. Du said that he would return to Hong Kong to communicate with overseas Chinese and encourage them to invest in various industries.

### Gas Prices Rise: Implemented on a Fixed Date; Prices Increased by 23% Starting Next Month on the 15th

The British-owned gas company, due to soaring coal prices, successively raised prices by 18% in January and August of last year. In November, it once again petitioned the Public Works Bureau to increase the surcharges according to the exchange rate between the legal currency and the British gold. After deliberation by the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Bureau, it was recommended to the Board of Directors to increase the surcharge to 23%. The company notified users one month in advance and implemented it for three months. By the end of April, the Public Works Bureau would consider handling it. Now the company has sent letters to all users in the city, stipulating that the price increase will be implemented from February 15th, and the additional fee of 23% will be charged according to the table and the original price.

### Shanghai Special: On the Remittance System (Continued)

— Huang Yu

3. Calculation of External Digging and Internal Deduction

As for the source of cash for the new agency specializing in remittance and discounting, a small part is purchased sporadically from merchants with remittance bills, and a large part is purchased from peers or banks. The general calculation method is external digging and internal deduction. Here are a few examples to illustrate:

Example 1: Merchant A purchases 10,000 yuan in cash from peer merchant B. Suppose the market price on that day is 45 yuan, then A will issue a remittance bill with a face value of 10,450 yuan to B, and the additional 450 yuan is the remittance fee. The calculation formula is as follows:

Example 2: Suppose customer C discounts a remittance bill with a face value of 10,000 yuan at A, then according to the market price on that day, A pays B 9,550 yuan in cash, and the deducted 450 yuan is the cash discount. The calculation formula is as follows:

Example 3: Suppose customer D purchases a remittance of 10,000 yuan from A with cash. According to the market price on that day, 9,570.25 yuan in cash should be paid. The calculation formula is as follows:

The calculation of remittance and discounting is generally no more than the above three methods. If readers carefully calculate the above three formulas, they will know the mutual conversion relationship between buying and selling at the same market price. Furthermore, the discount market price has no fixed standard. It is inevitable that operators will deliberately increase or decrease it in order to increase profits. The Joint Reserve Committee of Banks in Shanghai has come forward to maintain the market price and limit the size of the discount in order to regulate the market. However, the above-mentioned drawbacks are still unavoidable. Generally speaking, the market price of banks or money exchange shops with larger scale, longer history, and discounting as a concurrent business is more accurate, and the profit taken is also smaller. As for the others, it is beyond description. However, the daily market price is unpredictable, and there is little guarantee for the reliability of the bill. Therefore, it is not easy to operate this industry. The discount of each bank and shop must be slightly higher than the prescribed discount rate, probably for this reason.

4. Prospects for Remittance and Discounting

Recently, some people in the society have advocated the abolition of remittance bills, believing that this non-convertible bill is detrimental to all sectors of industry and commerce. However, everyone knows that remittance bills are a product of the post-war era and have a related relationship with the restricted deposit and withdrawal system. If they are fundamentally abolished, they will conflict with the financial stability measures of the Ministry of Finance. Most of the deposit balances of the banks will stagnate and become useless, and there will be a shortage of chips in the market. Taking a step back, if all these remittance bills are changed to checks, it will contradict the government's fundamental goal of stabilizing finance. Therefore, from the standpoint of wartime finance, this bill must continue to circulate in the market. The reasons are threefold:

1. To prevent a part of the funds from being converted into foreign exchange and reduce the fluctuations in the foreign exchange market, which has a close relationship with the implementation of foreign exchange control.

2. To reduce the amount of legal currency needed and avoid a large amount of cash flowing into the hands of traitors or the enemy to disrupt China's wartime finance.

3. To stabilize the foundation of the banking industry, so that commercial banks can adjust their deposit and lending business during the war, and the risk of deposit and withdrawal can be avoided.

Even more, for a year, remittance bills have been proven by facts to be able to be used as trading chips, so remittance transactions are only a procedure between banks and money shops, and there is no inconvenience to the depositors themselves. What is lost is only a discounting system that has emerged in Shanghai under abnormally developed conditions. If all sectors do not need cash, then there is still no loss to speak of. Even if this type of remittance bill is used for payment, the price may be discounted in certain transactions, but it is only a minimum amount and has no major impact on the overall finance. On the other hand, we can take this opportunity to cultivate our people's habit of using bills and have a considerable understanding of bills, so that our country's industry and commerce can reach another new stage. Therefore, losing a horse may not be a blessing in disguise. If the banks and money shops in this city come forward to negotiate the abolition of the discounting system, or impose strict restrictions on the discount rate, it will be even more beneficial to stabilizing the financial market. In short, this method was designed to cope with the wartime environment, so it can be abolished invisibly when the war ends. At the same time, the non-convertibility of today is also a temporary state. We don't need to worry about it and make a fuss about nothing. (End)

### Case of German-Jewish Man Violating Chinese Woman

High Court Second Branch Opens Trial Tomorrow

C. Brahn, a 52-year-old German Jew and representative of the German Golden Chemical Society in Shanghai, currently residing at No. 133 Yuanmingyuan Road, on the pretext of hiring a Chinese language teacher last summer, lured Shi Limi (19 years old this year), the daughter of Shi Hua, a Wuxi woman currently residing at No. 1346 Yuyuan Road, to his residence for sexual intercourse. A Korean woman was his assistant, causing Shi Limi to be unable to resist. Later, Brahn gave Shi Limi a check for 1,000 yuan, instructing her

not to make a fuss.

After being violated, Shi Limi became pregnant. Brahn, together with Huang Cheng, a Fujianese doctor of Western medicine residing at No. [illegible] Lane 30 Ximo Road, jointly instigated Shi Limi to have an abortion. Later, Shi Hua discovered it and Shi Limi revealed the previous situation. The mother and daughter then hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the criminal court of the First Special District Court, accusing Brahn and Huang Cheng of disrupting the family and instigating abortion. The defendant Brahn confessed to the sexual intercourse and said

continuous sexual intercourse

had been going on for two years. After the preliminary trial, Judge Xiao Xiefen acquitted Brahn and Huang Cheng. Shi Limi and Shi Hua refused to accept the judgment and hired a lawyer Wei Wenhan to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. The reason for their appeal was "For the case of suing the defendants for disrupting the family and instigating abortion, supplementary reasons are provided. According to the case, the first defendant Brahn intended to commit sexual intercourse and used money as a method of inducement to have a relationship with the first appellant. The first instance has already admitted in court that

pregnancy due to sexual intercourse

is also an undisputed fact by the appellees, and also caused the first appellant to leave the family, which constitutes a crime under Article 241, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. After the first appellant discovered that she was pregnant and told the first appellee, he, in order to avoid responsibility, instigated the first appellant to have an abortion, threatening her with the reputation at stake and promising money as bait. The second appellee examined and designed the abortion. Between August 10th and 20th of the 27th year, the first appellee took her to the address of the second appellee, and the second appellee gave her abortion

black pills

twelve pills, and instructed her

to take one pill each time

three times a day, and to finish them in four days. When there was no effect, the second appellee performed an injection procedure, one injection every other day. After three injections, there was still no effect. The first appellee asked the second appellee to ask the German doctor Shoushibo to check and determine a date to proceed with the abortion procedure. The above facts, in addition to the statements made by the first and second appellees in court, are also evidenced by the documents presented to the court. Later, because the first appellant was

timid about the procedure

and dared not go, she finally dared not go despite the urging of the first appellee. The first instance confused the actions of the second appellee with the actions of Shoushibo, and concluded that it was only a preparatory act and could not be considered a crime. According to the unconsummated crime, it refers to starting to commit a crime but not succeeding, or not producing the result of a crime. The so-called start refers to the fact that the intention to commit a crime has not reached the degree of consummation. This is clearly stipulated in the precedent of the Supreme Court. The second appellee in this case

had an abortion

by giving the first appellant pills and performing injections. The act of committing the crime had already begun, which is very obvious. Furthermore, the preparatory act is the preparatory act before the start. The second appellee in this case has already started the act of committing a crime, only without the result of a crime. Therefore, the second appellee is undoubtedly guilty of attempted abortion. The first instance considered it to be only a preparatory act, which is completely inconsistent with

the facts and connections.

It is really inappropriate to suddenly declare the appellants not guilty. Furthermore, when the first instance was reviewing the case, the court announced that it had not questioned the facts of the second appellee in detail, such as (1) What illness did the first appellee introduce to see the doctor? (2) What illness did the second appellee's black medicine treat? (3) Whether the first appellant had an illness, whether the uterine disease was related to the facts of the crime were not questioned, causing the appellees to

get away with it.

We are really not satisfied. Therefore, we respectfully ask your court to summon the appellees to court for detailed questioning, and to make a fair judgment based on the facts and the law, which is really virtuous. We respectfully submit this to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court." According to the statement, the Second Branch of the High Court has scheduled the trial for 3 pm tomorrow (the 31st). It is hoped that this lawsuit involving a German-Jewish man violating a Chinese woman can obtain a fair trial in the near future.

### French Concession Police Capture a Large Number of Hat-Snatching Thieves

Handed Over to the Court to Await the Arrest of Accomplices for Further Interrogation

In the French Concession, at the tram and bus stops on Nanyang Bridge, Dongxin Bridge Street, and Aiduya Road, Baxian Bridge, etc., there were often rogue bandits snatching passengers' hats. There were also guests carrying luggage on rickshaws whose hats (commonly called "flying palace") were snatched. It turned out that a certain inspector of the French Police Department also had a silk velvet hat worth more than 40 yuan snatched from him while passing the intersection of Ximen Road and Wangzhi Road in a rickshaw last month. Therefore, he ordered all patrol officers to strictly investigate and arrest the perpetrators. Now, detective Sui Wenzhi discovered that a large group of hat-snatching bandits were hiding in No. 146 Pingjili Road. So, he secretly went there the night before and arrested Wang A'er, Zhang Liansheng, Xu Decai, Zhang Jinsheng, Wu Xiaomao, Wan Gensheng, Zhou Jisheng, Huang Lianjiang, He Houcai, Zhang Wanchun, Lin Xiaogou, Liu Haiming, Li Jinshun, Huang Meisheng, Dong Xichang, Yu Caigui, Bian Yousheng, Li Qinghe, and other eighteen people, and found more than a dozen stolen hats, which were taken to the police station together. The day before yesterday, they were handed over to the Second Special Court, requesting detention and investigation to arrest the accomplices who were still at large. After Judge Liao took his seat in the Criminal Division One and interrogated them, he announced that the hearing would be adjourned to February 9th. The defendants were returned to custody.

### The Hengxi Ship Escapes Danger and Arrives in Shanghai

Two Salted Meat Junks Were Stolen and Plundered

The Zi Lin News reported that the German ship Hengxi encountered pirates near Zhanghuang Port on the north bank of the Yangtze River on Friday (the 27th). Because a certain Japanese small destroyer patrolling the lower reaches of the Yangtze River received the news, it fired machine guns and turned on searchlights, so it was not plundered. The pirates were estimated to be more than fifty people, traveling in several junks, but they did not escape empty-handed. Two large junks fully loaded with salted meat were seized by the pirates and their whereabouts are unknown. The salted meat in the ships was originally scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai and was worth about 10,000 yuan. The Hengxi ship returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 28th) afternoon, carrying chickens, pigs, and other items. The Chinese crew members and passengers who were kidnapped and escaped told about what happened: that night, around 9 o'clock, the Hengxi ship was berthed at Zhanghuang Port, waiting for merchants in the area to load goods. The passengers of the ship who landed at Zhanghuang Port saw many junks in the darkness, and the people in the junks were carrying rifles and other weapons, so they believed they were pirates. When they saw the people in the junks ordering two junks full of salted meat to stop, they were even more convinced. They shouted loudly that they had encountered pirates. A certain Japanese destroyer that was not far from the Hengxi ship heard the news and immediately fired machine guns and turned on searchlights. The pirates fled. It seemed quite fast. In the rush, they were unable to board the Hengxi ship and carry out a large-scale looting. According to several passengers, there were six people dressed as workers who did not carry weapons and boarded the Hengxi ship from a junk, persuading the passengers on the ship to leave the ship. At that time, they suspected that these six people might be disguised as pirates, luring passengers to leave the ship and go to the ferry so that the pirates could search and loot more easily. It is reported that the Hengxi ship has encountered bad luck several times. At the beginning of last week, when it had just set sail from Shanghai, three armed bandits boarded the ship and went straight to the comprador's office, robbing more than 2,000 yuan in banknotes. The three thieves are still at large.

### Death of He Yinqi

A Great Loss to the Physics Community

### Amazing Invention in the Medical Field: The Efficacy of Radium Emanation Tablets

Since Madame Curie of France discovered that the main component of mineral spring water is radium, scientists have developed Radigam Emanator tablets, which allow people to produce radium water of unparalleled value at home. These radium emanation tablets have small holes and contain radium salts that do not dissolve in water. To make radium water, simply immerse the tablet in plain boiled water. After twelve hours, it can be taken for drinking, and then immersed again for continued use. It is inexhaustible and truly the most economical natural tonic. Radium water is effective in treating rheumatism, rheumatic bone pain, headaches, neuralgia, lumbago, neuritis, sexual neurasthenia, premature aging, constipation, indigestion, insomnia and other ailments, and its efficacy far exceeds that of mineral spring water. Doctors in major hospitals are happy to use it. It is said that the general manager of the local branch is China Electrotherapy Company at 770 Jing'an Temple Road, telephone 33837. Explanations and written requests will be sent immediately.

### Hunan University Moves to Chenxi

Teachers and Students Exert Much Effort

(Changsha Dispatch) Hunan University suffered a raid by 27 Japanese aircraft on April 10th last year. Staff and students were killed or injured, dormitories collapsed, the science building was half destroyed, and the library was completely destroyed. For a time, the school was in chaos, and it was extremely shocking. Fortunately, with the encouragement of the entire faculty and students and the efforts of the authorities, classes resumed immediately after only a week of suspension. Later, as the war became increasingly tense, Changsha was subject to frequent air raids, and schools at all levels in the provincial capital successively retreated to the countryside. For the sake of teaching safety, Hunan University had to deliberate on setting up a branch campus. Initially, they planned to set up a branch campus in Zhijiang and sent personnel to negotiate with three local schools to rent all the school buildings originally rented by a certain school, which could accommodate approximately 400-500 students. Unexpectedly, it was abandoned midway, and they had no choice but to move to a more remote location with fifty or sixty civilian houses, which could at most accommodate just over 200 people. However, the total number of new and old students at Hunan University exceeded 700, and with faculty, staff and workers, it would be no less than 900 people, which was insufficient. Therefore, they hesitated to make a decision. Fortunately, Minister Chen visited the school in August and instructed them to build temporary school buildings. Therefore, the school officials proceeded with renting or buying the houses on one hand and began preparing for construction on the other. Since October, the entire school has been mobilized and has been exceptionally busy. Books, instruments and school supplies have been shipped in batches, and the faculty and students gathered in Chenxi at the end of October and officially began working on November 1st, immediately opening registration and starting classes.

### Guangdong East High School Adds a Senior Commercial Course

Guangdong East High School (formerly known as Guangzhao High School) in Shanghai was founded by the current principal, Lu Songqian. It has a long history and an excellent reputation. After the August 13th Incident, the magnificent school buildings it had built on Shuidao Road were destroyed by the fires of war, and it moved to a temporary location at 629 Seymour Road (near Xin Zha Road). It has persevered and continued to work hard, and student performance has generally been better than before. Recently, due to the increasing number of students and the insufficient number of classrooms, it has expanded the school buildings by adding adjacent school buildings to increase the number of students. At the same time, it has increased the facilities for physical education and natural sciences in order to achieve its educational goals. In order to meet the needs of the times, it has added a senior commercial course starting in the spring of the 28th year, first enrolling one class each for the upper and lower semesters of the first year. It has hired Mr. Huang Peiqi, a bachelor of commerce from Columbia University in the United States, as the dean of academic affairs, and Mr. Li Bingyu, a master of commerce from the University of Pennsylvania in the United States, as well as domestic well-known university graduates with teaching experience, as teachers. It has also hired business leaders as consultants to gather wisdom and create talents that meet the needs of the times. The school has close ties with major companies and banks in Shanghai, and graduates with excellent grades do not need to worry about finding suitable jobs, as the school is responsible for finding them employment. The school's general courses for senior and junior high schools and senior commercial courses are scheduled to recruit new students on February 3rd. It is said that the number of applicants has been extremely high recently. Those with formal credentials who pass the review may be exempted from part or all of the examination.

### The Achievements of the Chemical Engineering Department of Suzhou High School

Seven years ago, Suzhou High School, in view of the extremely urgent need for chemical engineering talents in the domestic industrial sector, took the lead in the education sector of this province to establish a chemical engineering department to cultivate chemical engineering talents and established the Suzhou High School Chemical Factory to provide practical training. All products, such as soap, leather, paint, etc., are quite popular with society. They have been expanding their efforts and working hard year by year, and have made remarkable achievements. To date, there have been three graduating classes, and a large number of graduates are serving in the chemical industry both locally and abroad. The famous chemical factories in Shanghai, such as Tianli Ammonia Factory, Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, Tianyuan Electrochemistry Factory, China Vegetable Oil Factory, New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, Zhenhua Paint Factory. Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Factory, Guben Soap Factory, and Dazhong Dye Factory, as well as the largest-scale Tianjin Yongli Alkali Factory, and the Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory in Liuhe County, which had just been completed and put into operation before the incident, and the Yongming Paint Factory in Peiping, all have graduates serving there, with excellent performance and the full trust of the factory. Therefore, each class of students is hired in advance by various factories when they are about to graduate, and there is a great shortage of supply, which shows that the school's training is effective and the equipment is complete. It is also conceivable that the industry has a great need for such talents. As for the graduates who have continued to study chemical engineering theory in pursuit of further education and have been admitted to Jiaotong University, Zhejiang University, Central University, Tsinghua University, Nankai University, and the Chemical Engineering Research Institute, there are also many, and their achievements are excellent. Since the school resumed operations in Shanghai last year, it has been actively preparing to restore the department. It is now heard that preparations are in place, and the student internship method has been agreed upon with several major factories in Shanghai. Therefore, it has been decided to recruit a class of first-year students starting in the spring semester. The deadline for registration is January 31, and the new student examination will be held on February 1. In this extraordinary period, chemical engineering is more important than other types of engineering. It is expected that the number of young people who aspire to take the exam will be very high.

### West Union First Division Football Match: Tung Wah Loses Two Matches to Western Capture

One to Three... First Half Zero to One

The West Union First Division football match between Tung Wah and Western Capture was held yesterday morning at 10:30 AM at the Recreation Ground despite the rain. The audience was deterred by the rain, totaling less than 400 people. The ball was heavy and the ground slippery, but the competition was quite fierce. Tung Wah's offense was strong, but their luck was not good, and they lost the first half by a small margin of zero to one. After the break, Western Capture became more and more courageous. After Living-stone scored a goal, Sun Huizhang pulled one back. Finally, Whiswood scored another goal. As a result, Western Capture won by three to one. In the afternoon, other matches such as the Chinese YMCA Cup, Lido vs. Yuanchang, etc., were not played due to rain.

Western Capture Takes the Lead

Western Capture kicked off and was blocked. Tung Wah penetrated twice from the right, but both failed. Wu Binghao tried a shot, which went wide. Then Willie Watert touched the ball outside the penalty area and was penalized with a free kick. A. Dae rushed it too quickly, and the ball flew out of bounds. Western Capture continuously took corner kicks, but without success. Tung Wah kicked the ball far forward. A. Dae took the opportunity to rush in and shoot with all his might, but missed the goal, which was a pity. Not long after, Western Capture was awarded a free kick just outside Tung Wah's penalty area. Xu Tu took the kick, and Zhou Dayun deflected it into a corner kick. Livingstone crossed the ball, but was saved by Dayun again. After 20 minutes, Livingstone passed to Hutley, who passed it to the center. Xu Tu fouled in the forward area, and Western Capture took the lead by one goal. Tung Wah vowed to counterattack. Wu Binghao received a pass from A. Dae. Jebson came out to block, and Wu shot hastily, going high over the crossbar. Western Capture attacked. Greenburg hooked a shot from 20 yards, which was extremely fast and dangerous. Dayun held it down. Tung Wah's Shen Shiyan dribbled the ball and rushed forward, but was blocked and fell to the ground. Jia Youliang rushed to pick up the ball, and A. Dae shot at the goal, forcing a corner kick. Jia's cross was excellent. Sun Huizhang headed the ball, but it was saved again. Western Capture thus led by one to zero in the first half.

Tung Wah Unluckily Defeated

The second half began, and Western Capture changed its lineup. Victor was moved to the back, Pate took the position of right inside forward, and Jebson became the left midfielder. After this adjustment, their momentum became even stronger. Livingstone's shot was caught. Pate then chipped the ball, which landed by the goal. Zhou Dayun was blocked and unable to save it. Fortunately, Jiang Zhaoxiang rushed back and kicked the ball out, averting the danger. Not long after, Hutley received a short pass from Pate and swept the ball sideways. Dai Yun caught it. Hu then launched a long shot, which was saved again. Tung Wah was in a dangerous situation and urgently launched an offensive. A. Dae single-handedly charged straight into the enemy's territory, but Sun Huizhang was offside and the attempt was ruled out. Instead, Livingstone scored a goal with a long shot from Hutley, 20 minutes into the second half. Tung Wah counterattacked. Sun Huizhang and Wu Binghao advanced side by side. Wu's shot went wide. After 28 minutes, Jia Youliang hooked the ball, and Watert failed to catch it. The ball landed in the goal area. Whiswood tried to kick it but failed. Sun Huizhang rushed up and poked the ball in, and the ball went into the net. Tung Wah pulled back one goal, but not a minute later, after Hutley's corner kick was punched out by Zhou, he got another corner kick opportunity. Hu crossed the ball perfectly, and Whiswood was in the right position and scored with one kick. Tung Wah's fate was sealed, and they were defeated by three to one.

### West Union First Division Football Match: Zhendan Suffers a Crushing Defeat

Result: Twelve to One; St. Francis' Great Victory Yesterday

Another West Union First Division football match, Zhendan vs. St. Francis, was played at Jiaozhou Park at 10:45 AM. Both teams' players were not all present. St. Francis played with ten players, while Zhendan played with nine. St. Francis' momentum was strong, while Zhendan's skills were inferior and their numbers were fewer, resulting in a one-sided match. After the start, Fuen scored twice. Wang Zuyi pulled back one goal. Then K. Xu scored twice. Fuen and McKellar continued to score. In the first half, St. Francis won by a large margin of seven to one. After the break, Zhendan was even more unable to support themselves, and their goal was wide open. Hu Erfei became the target of everyone's attacks. Zhendan had a penalty kick opportunity, but Zhang Susheng missed it. When the St. Francis team took the lead by twelve to one, Zhendan began with Lin Jianpeng scoring a goal. As a result, Zhendan suffered a crushing defeat of two to fifteen. Xu Haili won against Rong Mozhen three to one. Cai Xiuyu won against Ling Xiao three to zero.

### Women's Table Tennis Tournament

The All-Shanghai Women's Table Tennis Championship, organized by the Women's Christian Association, began its second week of knockout matches at 2:00 PM yesterday in the Association's auditorium. Rong Mozhen, Yuan Lianru, and others successively advanced. The match between Xu Haili and Feng Mingyu was not played because Feng Mingyu was late. The Competition Committee did not order a make-up match and decided that both players would advance at the same time, which violated the competition rules and was inappropriate. It was also unfair to those who were eliminated. Currently, there are a total of 11 participants in the round-robin stage, including Liang Yujie, who had a bye in the first and second weeks. The results of yesterday's matches and today's schedule are recorded below.

### Mr. New Quixote

— Yang Jinhao

Mr. New Quixote's background is not a noble knight, but a nouveau riche who has fallen into ruin. He doesn't really want to be a knight, but just pretends to be one. He is not really enthusiastic about ancient chivalry, but is blinded by profit and desire, causing him to stumble and fall, showing a ridiculous and hateful image of an awkward knight that is even worse than Mr. Quixote.

He is not tall, in fact he is very short; he rides not a skinny horse, but a starving dog; he carries not a long spear, but a short sound. He wants to avoid ruin and maintain his status as a nouveau riche, but he can't think of any legitimate ways. So, he has to secretly dig into other people's walls and steal their property, and then sit high on his throne, leading his dog by the nose and waving his gavel, proclaiming his knightly victory over the demons!

His so-called demons are not windmills that he has mistaken, but all the owners of the things he has stolen.

Every time, he always steals in the dead of night, when people are unprepared. But, again and again, the thefts are discovered, and people naturally become wary. So, when he goes to dig into the walls again, he triggers an alarm. The shadow of ruin appears in his mind, but it also encourages his chivalrous spirit. He hardens his head, raises his gavel and strikes anyone he sees, and leads his starving dog to rampage through people's houses, rummaging through chests and cabinets while shouting: "I am helping you to slay demons, drive away thieves, and seek the welfare of your whole family!" And the starving dog under his crotch barks madly.

He still thinks that people are not awake from their dreams, and even if they have stood up, they are still confused; that he can scare them with a small chisel and deceive them with a few words. In this way, after plundering his "spoils of victory," he can proclaim to the outside world with great pride: "I have eradicated the demons!" What a beautiful knightly demeanor!

Unfortunately, this wishful thinking, which only sees profit and not reality, is completely wrong. At this time, people are not only fully awake, but also prepared. This nouveau riche in decline, though he seems to have some brute strength, cannot withstand people's long-term group attack. Seeing that he is already hoarse and exhausted, and about to fall, he has no choice but to struggle again and stick out his tongue to the bystanders, uttering a few knightly words: "Look, the demons are at work! You must cooperate with me and work together to kill the demons, in order to seek eternal stability...peace..."

But who would listen to his nonsense and let him constantly rob their homes? Some slapped the clown to the ground, and others kicked over the starving dog. He, this Mr. New Quixote, could only touch his nose and stare blankly.

### Hardship Brothers

— Yang Yanqi

The second half of the night was particularly cold. Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan, two brothers dressed as farmers, braved the wind and followed a vague map, carrying that letter, to reach the designated place before dawn.

It was too cold, and the moon and stars dared not come out, only a dark cloud. There was no light on the road, only the flashlights in the hands of Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan. They each took their frozen feet and walked with big and fast steps. Occasionally, a few singing tunes came out of their mouths, but they were blown down by the cold wind, and the result was still silence.

Their hearts were beating faster than their steps; hot, almost boiling. The blood in their bodies was also surging. Their spirits were good enough, and they moved forward bravely with their chests raised.

After walking for a while, suddenly, a loud stomp and a surprised cry:

"Hey! Who's there?"

Meng Yuan shone the flashlight to the side, and Zhong Yuan's flashlight also lit up: a person wearing a grass green military uniform, short, with a rifle, was the enemy's sentry.

"Who are you?" The bayonet of the rifle was waving between the heads of Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan.

Both flashlights went out, and the map in Zhong Yuan's hand also fell. The short sentry took out a flashlight and shined it on them. They had gone the wrong way.

The short sentry picked up the map: "Eight ga ya lu!"

Under the threat of the rifle, they were taken away by him. Meng Yuan seized an opportunity to divert the attention of the short sentry, stuffed that letter, that confidential letter, into his mouth, chewed it a few times, and swallowed it. The short sentry was shivering from the cold and was preparing to pull the trigger, so he didn't notice at all.

Passing a small slope and going down the mountain road was the enemy's branch camp.

Eight or nine soldiers with small mustaches were shivering around a pile of fire.

The short sentry brought Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan over, and they all stood up, as if they were very happy, and as if they were very scared, they quickly raised their guns.

"These two people were sneaking around on the mountain road, and they were also carrying flashlights, maps..."

"What are you doing?" A mournful-faced officer blurted out these words after a minute.

"We are farmers," Meng Yuan's weak voice.

"Then where did the flashlight come from?"

"Stolen," Zhong Yuan's loud voice.

"What about the map? How could you have a map?"

"Picked up," still Zhong Yuan.

"Hey, lies! You are spies! You can't hide it from me!" The short sentry caught Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan, and of course wanted to show off his achievements. After speaking, he smiled with his mouth stretched out, as if to show off, and as if he was complacent.

They had already searched Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan, and not only searched them, but also hit them hard with the butt of the rifle.

"If you tell me the information you want to bring, or the battle plan you want to notify, you can avoid death!" the officer said.

They were silent. The short sentry spoke again:

"No need to ask nicely, let's give them a little color to see first!"

The officer actually accepted a sentry's suggestion. So, an axe was brought. The tallest person took the axe and told Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan to stretch out their hands and press their fingers on the table. He hammered down hard with the back of the axe. Once, twice... Tears fell from Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan's eyes, one drop, two drops—falling on their bodies, like a drop of kerosene, falling into the flames, arousing fierce anger.

One minute, two minutes, their fingernails cracked open; blood, thread by thread...

Zhong Yuan suddenly screamed sharply, his throat hoarse, with blood and tears; his nerves were also numb, and the stimulation of death, the devil's poisonous hand, made him lose his autonomy.

"I'm willing to tell you, we're carrying a letter, and the letter says tomorrow morning..." Zhong Yuan said in a hoarse voice.

The tallest person stopped, and everyone held their breath, looking at Zhong Yuan.

Suddenly, Meng Yuan, who was on the side, grabbed the axe from the enemy's hand and struck Zhong Yuan's head violently. A stream of bright red blood spurted several feet high.

Then, following the momentum, he struck his own throat with another axe, and bright red blood also spurted several feet away.

A group of short soldiers were stunned, and some shouted loudly; what they saw was the most tragic scene in the world!

Meng Yuan fell into the pool of blood, convulsed and crawled over, stroking his brother's body with trembling hands, a final smile floating on his face.

### Emerald City

— Zou Xiao

——On National Novels

"Emerald City was written by Li Baichuan of the Qing Dynasty. The Yenching University library has an old manuscript with the author's preface. The only other versions have a preface by Tao in the 29th year of Qianlong and a preface by Hou in the 36th year of Qianlong. It is now only known that Baichuan was a native of Jiangnan, named Zhu Xiang. (See Sun Kaidi's 'List of Popular Novels,' page 249.)

Volumes 54 to 59, these six volumes of this book, are about suppressing the Japanese pirates in Zhejiang. The historical figures include Yu Dayou, Lin Run, Zhang Jing, Yan Song, and Zhao Wenhua. There are also fictional characters such as Zhu Wenwei and Lin Dai. The big facts are one true and nine false. The true parts are mostly specifically pointed out in the book. For example, Hai Rui's memorial to the emperor is found in Volume 226 of the History of Ming. Volume 56, which describes Wenhua presenting wine, is based on Volume 308 of the History of Ming, the Biography of Zhao Wenhua: 'Wenhua wanted to ingratiate himself with the emperor and presented Baihua Immortal Wine, falsely saying, "Your servant's teacher Song takes it and lives long." The emperor drank it and found it sweet, and ordered to ask Song. Song was surprised and said, "How did Wenhua get this?" Then he said, "Your servant has never been near medicine. I don't know why I live so long." Song hated Wenhua for not telling him first, and summoned him to scold him. Wenhua knelt and wept, and dared not rise for a long time. Xu Jie and Li Ben saw this and interceded for him, and then ordered him to leave. When Song returned home after vacation, the nine ministers came to pay their respects. Song was still angry with Wenhua and ordered his servants to help him out. Wenhua was very embarrassed and heavily bribed Song's wife to intercede for him. Wenhua came out to pay his respects, and Song treated him as before.'"

The novel says: "The suppression of the Japanese pirates section criticizes Hu Meilin without reservation. I don't know what he means. Although Meilin's general career is not worth watching, his merits and demerits are enough to offset each other. Among the local officials at the time, he cannot be said to be unremarkable, and it is not right to write him off with a stroke of the pen." Guessing, the big reason is that Hu Zongxian flattered Yan Song and was considered to be part of the Yan faction. "The novel often regrets this." But Hu Zongxian was able to use Qi Jiguang and Yu Dayou, which can also be said to be knowing people and being good at employing them.

"The Three Marshals Achieve Great Achievements in Suppressing the Japanese Pirates" is mostly fabricated. This chapter narrates that Lin Dai led more than a hundred generals and soldiers outside the city of Jiangning to kill the barbarian leader Miao Mei among the 50,000 to 60,000 Japanese pirates. Xu Hai and Zaizhen, etc., are obviously inconsistent with historical facts. The so-called three marshals refer to Yu Dayou, Lin Dai, and Zhu Wenwei. According to the Biography of Yu Dayou in the History of Ming, "The new Japanese pirates defeated the soldiers of the Nanjing Capital Governor Zhou Gand the 30-odd ships." In this way, the governor Lu Fengyi, who defended Nanjing, was also somewhat unreliable.

But these six chapters of the story of suppressing the Japanese pirates are generally correct, such as Zhang Jing's injustice and Lin Run's impeachment of Yan Song, which are all famous historical facts.

The book describes Zhao Wenhua bribing the Japanese pirates with 600,000 gold, asking them to pretend to be defeated, so as to claim credit, which can be said to scold this traitor severely. And the section describing the three marshals sweeping away the Japanese pirates is also extremely gratifying: "The Japanese pirates were killed by the officers and soldiers in a chaotic manner, and they ran for another five or six miles. Seeing that the chasing soldiers were gradually far away, they each searched to the river bank, and there were only more than 20 seagoing ships. The pirates scrambled to cross, killing each other, and the sound of crying shook the sky and the earth. There were many people and the boats were heavy, and several more ships sank. The pirates were hungry, and they collapsed along the way, or those who could not move were all killed by the officers and soldiers, no less than four or five thousand people. At dawn, the chasing soldiers arrived again and searched everywhere. The pirates in the ship were walking when they suddenly heard the sound of the river shaking, a loud cannon, and the river was full of warships, and the cannons and rockets were like rain. The Japanese pirates were wounded by arrows and cannons, and nine out of ten were injured. When they arrived at Jiaoshan, they were smashed to pieces by Dayou's cannons, and not a single ship or a single person escaped from the waterway. Dayou had ambushes in all the sea entrances, and he also killed a lot of escaped pirates." (Excerpt from Volume 59) The Japanese pirates were defeated, which was no different from Cao Aman's defeat at Chibi, which made people excited.

Tense hearts—waiting for the arrival of the devil:

Fight it! Fight it to the death!

Look at you: ——

Patriotic farmers are everywhere on the mountainside, and hardworking students are everywhere:

Everywhere is building roads and bridges, and everywhere is training compatriots.

One by one, they raised iron fists: for resistance, for survival!

Arise!

Use our time to eliminate our enemies!

Let him "have a way to come, but no way to go!"

The air has brought the sound of air raid alarms,

Come! Defend our capital! Hold our villages!

### The Course of China's Gold and Silver Policy

— Jie

In wartime financial policy, monetary policy, in the era before currency management, involved recoining to reduce the value of currency in order to increase revenue. In the modern era of currency management, it involves inflation for utilization. However, China has not taken the path of inflation. Instead, it has combined increasing tax revenue and issuing public debt for utilization, making it the primary wartime financial strategy. The ongoing policy of collecting gold and silver is aimed at increasing the strength of wartime finance. The recent report in this newspaper about the Ministry of Finance's circular on the 21st, prohibiting private purchase of gold and silver by silver businesses and establishing a purchasing method, can be said to represent the peak of the gold and silver collection policy.

Since silver was nationalized on November 3, 1935, the most forceful aspect of the wartime gold and silver policy has been the "Regulations for Converting Gold into Legal Tender" and its implementation details, announced on the 10th. These regulations stipulated that those who exchanged raw gold, goldware, gold coins, or newly produced gold nuggets and gold dust for legal tender would receive a handling fee of three to five percent. An additional six percent was given for purchasing national salvation bonds, and for legal tender deposits, a weekly interest of two tenths of a percent was added to the newly set interest rate. Secondly, the "Measures for Supervising Silver Shops in Collecting and Converting Gold" announced on November 1, 1938, stipulated that silver shops could only buy or sell gold and nine-tenths pure gold in the form of ornaments and utensils. Gold bars, gold nuggets, gold leaves, gold dust, and mined gold were strictly prohibited from being bought or sold. Shops specializing in buying gold dust and mined gold were required to contact the Central Bank to establish a entrusted contract and resell all of it to the Central Bank. In mid-November of the same year, restrictions were further imposed on the private export of gold and gold ornaments of any shape, or their transport to occupied areas. Auxiliary methods included: The "National Salvation Bond Issuance Measures" stipulated that national currency, hard currency, foreign currency, and raw gold and silver could be used to purchase bonds, while the "Gold Bond" regulations specified that raw gold or gold coins could be used to purchase bonds.

The above main and auxiliary measures for the collection of gold and silver can be said to be very detailed. However, when China implemented the legal tender policy, the method of issuing legal tender with 60% specie reserve and 40% guarantee to the issuing banks was not abolished. Therefore, there are still some shortcomings in the progress of wartime gold and silver collection policy. Although the main measures have clear regulations on purchase and transport, they have not considered the possibility of using the purchase as preparation for legal tender issuance. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance issued an order to financial institutions, stipulating that if silver businesses in various places have signed legal tender issuance contracts with the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank, and purchased gold and silver as reserves, they should first report to the issuing bank they contacted and to the Gold and Silver Collection Office, and entrust them to handle the matter in accordance with the case, to eliminate speculation or smuggling. If they have not signed a legal tender issuance contract and do not report to request entrustment, they will be treated as private purchases for profit and punished according to the circumstances. This measure involves two agencies, the issuing bank and the Gold and Silver Collection Office, so it is naturally difficult for malpractices to occur, making it easier to prevent or eliminate speculation or smuggling.

This set of regulations is likely to bring the following two benefits to China's wartime finances:

First, the penetration of legal tender into the people. Taking silver alone, since the implementation of the legal tender system, the silver collected by the government, excluding the original reserves of various banks, amounted to 22.5 million yuan by the end of June 1936. However, according to estimates, the result of years of import and export is that there should be at least 700 million yuan of silver in the country. The minimum amount that can be concentrated should be 350 million yuan, meaning that at least half of the silver in the country is scattered among the people. The current provision that silver businesses in various places can purchase silver as legal tender reserve allows legal tender to flow more widely into remote rural areas.

Second, the increase in overseas funds. Overseas funds are financial goods that can be used for international payments. Although all countries in the world have now abandoned the gold standard, gold still retains the function of value storage in international payments. As for silver, although it does not have the same storage function as gold, China can easily convert silver into gold under the Sino-American Monetary Agreement. The application of this measure will naturally be more effective in collecting gold and silver in various places compared to relying solely on the Gold and Silver Collection Office, and will rapidly increase overseas funds.

The progress of China's wartime gold and silver collection policy, as discussed in the second paragraph of this article, to the current silver business gold and silver purchase measures, shows that the collection methods are becoming more diversified, and the rules for preventing malpractices are becoming more stringent. It is commendable that so much progress has been made in a short year and a half. As for using gold and silver collection as a monetary policy in wartime financial policy, replacing the inflationary monetary policy, and using it in parallel with tax and public debt policies, this kind of wartime financial policy is worthy of study.

### The Path Our Country's Wartime Industry Should Take

— Hu Xishan

Promoting the Construction of Small-Unit Production System

Since the beginning of the War of Resistance against Japan, nineteen months have passed, and the number of industries that have moved from the war zones to the interior and those newly built in the southwestern provinces is not small. This is indeed a good phenomenon in our country's War of Resistance. To strengthen the War of Resistance, the primary task is to increase the total national production. The government uses not currency, but material goods and labor to perform its duties. In peacetime, the government can obtain a fixed amount of currency income from the annual national income to purchase the necessary material goods and labor. Therefore, the source of national finance in peacetime can be based on national income, earnings, and consumption. However, once a country enters a state of war, its need for material goods and labor is many times greater than in peacetime, and the nature of its needs is even more urgent. In this situation, the government absolutely cannot rely entirely on taxes to cope with the environment, but should make every effort to use all domestic resources to increase the total national production, in order to obtain a large amount of material goods to supply the general needs of the war.

In our country's current situation, Japan is using both economic and military force in an attempt to destroy all of our country's economic undertakings. In the war zones, it has occupied our country's markets and all resources. At the same time, it is using military force to seize all the factories in the war zones, forcefully occupying them. Just in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, 70 percent of our country's newest large-scale factories have been damaged or occupied. All the industrial areas in our country, including Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuxi, Nanjing, Guangdong, Wuhan, and other places, have had their production functions completely eliminated. Japan's sole attempt is to completely destroy China's entire production capacity, so that China's material needs for the War of Resistance will depend entirely on imports from foreign countries. At the same time, it is also engaged in destroying and preventing the import of foreign materials, so that China loses its long-term War of Resistance strength. Everything is under Japanese control and manipulation. This kind of attempt, in fact, is a policy of wishful thinking. However, with China's major cities and economic functions being destroyed and seized by the Japanese, if our country does not quickly seek to rebuild and strive to strengthen economic production capacity, it will fall into Japan's trap.

Therefore, strengthening the production mechanism is our country's current urgent task. Although our country's general production has been developing continuously in the rear since the start of the war, according to our country's current economic mechanism, these are not enough to fully adapt to the needs of the entire War of Resistance. Therefore, we believe that the large-scale development of small-unit industry is necessary to promote in China's current situation. What is the large-scale development of small-unit industry? To put it clearly, it is the large-scale construction of small-capital unit industries throughout the country during the War of Resistance, the scattered construction of a large number of production units to lay the economic foundation for long-term War of Resistance, and to compensate for all the production capacity lost in the war zones.

In fact, the reason for promoting this small-unit industrial production is not simply based on the desire to strengthen the general production mechanism. To put it more broadly, it is to adapt to the needs of the entire War of Resistance. This point can be explained in detail from the following points:

(1) The most valuable point of small-capital industries is the convenience of planning and establishment. This can be analyzed from two aspects: In terms of capital: Speaking from the general investment psychology of the people, in the state of war, private investors often regard investment in large-scale industries as a risk, which is inevitable. But it is more possible in fact to set aside a portion of their funds to engage in small-capital industries. At the same time, it can lead a portion of the idle funds in society into legitimate production undertakings. Secondly, from the point of view of establishment, it is difficult to establish a large-scale industry even in peacetime; let alone in wartime, whether it is the design of power and machinery, the acquisition of raw materials, the recruitment of technical talents, and other issues, it will inevitably be doubly difficult. Small-capital industries, however, take simplicity and ease as a prerequisite, so it is easy to solve the above-mentioned problems, and can make the most of local resources as a basis for production.

(2) If large-scale industries are concentrated in one place to achieve mass production to meet huge needs, it will create a target for enemy occupation and bombing, making these production organizations lose their security guarantee. And once necessary, it is not easy to move. For example, the number of factories in Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places that have been damaged due to the difficulty of moving machinery is more than 100 million yuan. Therefore, in order to avoid this kind of damage and maintain production strength, it is better to turn large into small and establish a large number of small-scale factories in various parts of the interior. This can not only maintain the overall productivity, but also establish a strong foundation for future economic development. Our country's financial and industrial organizations have always been concentrated in a small number of cities. Although the interior is rich in resources, the population is sparse and desolate. This kind of uneven crisis can be solved by using small-unit industrial organizations to build a base in these undeveloped areas. In the future, this base can be used as a basis for development and expansion. At the same time, several units can be united to establish a strong industrial center according to their regional distribution. Then, not only can everything be planned in a unified manner, but also a solid and practical path can be opened up for future production and construction.

(3) The promotion of small-unit industrial system can directly assist the military, because it can supply the needs of the front line of the War of Resistance. To establish a large-scale industry, it is necessary to use heavy machinery, hire a large number of workers, and build huge factory buildings to accommodate them before production can be carried out. Therefore, it must be established in a safe area in the rear. This kind of industry, in terms of its efficiency, can indeed constitute the industrial mechanism planned by the government and complete the production of various important supplies. However, it is not as easy and mobile as small-scale industry, and can be established in various areas near the front line. The front line of the battlefield has a great need for various material supplies, and most of them are of an urgent nature. But in fact, it is often difficult to quickly supply what they need from the rear due to the inconvenience of transportation and other reasons. Under this kind of combination of injuries, it is necessary to establish direct supply units in the nearby areas of the front line to facilitate military assistance. This requirement is difficult for large-scale industries to meet, and only small-scale industries can adapt to it.

(4) The large-scale promotion of small-capital industries can solve our country's current refugee problem. Since the outbreak of war in our country, the number of refugees has increased day by day due to the large war zone. Therefore, the relief of refugees has become a serious problem in our country. It is estimated that there are currently at least 50 to 60 million refugees in the country, trapped in difficult situations, and their lives are completely dependent on the maintenance of the government or other social organizations. The existence of this kind of fact has a direct damage to the government and society. These huge number of refugees not only lose their production capacity, but also have to be supplied with huge consumption. And the increase in refugees in the future is still possible. If this continues for a long time, it will be detrimental to our country's long-term war of resistance plan. Under the large-scale promotion of small-unit industrial system, these wasted labor forces will have the possibility of production. At the same time, the need for millions of dollars of refugee relief every month can also be used for production purposes.

(5) The small-unit industrial system can serve as the center for developing rural economic organizations. Due to the migration of a large number of people to the rural areas in the interior, various desolate areas have become densely populated areas, and the need for materials has increased sharply. However, where does this huge amount of materials come from in the self-sufficient rural areas to meet the needs? In this situation, the opportunistic import of foreign goods and inferior goods is inevitable. And the distribution of small-capital industries in various places can produce locally and meet local needs, prosper desolate areas and develop markets, in order to revitalize the rural economy. At the same time, it is also an effective warning line to prevent the import of foreign goods and inferior goods.

In summary, it can be clearly seen that promoting the small-unit industrial system has great advantages for our country's War of Resistance plan. And with the economic functions of various important cities being destroyed by the enemy today, our country feels an urgent need for this.

How should this plan be promoted? This is also a point that we should discuss. To establish a huge number of small-unit industries is a great plan, and it cannot be expected to be realized in a day or two. Therefore, we hope to proceed step by step in order. For the convenience of promotion, there should first be a basic organization to serve as the center of promotion. The first step of this central organization should be to conduct a general survey. This general survey includes two tasks: One is to estimate or investigate the nature and extent of the current material needs. If you do not understand the needs, how can you supply them? Therefore, this is a basic goal to determine production. Based on this goal, the types of production that should be available can also be determined, and their importance and urgency can be reviewed and adjusted. The second is to investigate the distribution of resources in various regions according to the regional distribution, and to divide the establishment of various units. With these two concrete goals, the foundation for construction has also been laid. At the same time, the government should use incentives to promote the will of the people to expand investment in small-unit industries, and use various positive methods to provide convenience, assistance, and guarantees in planning and establishment, so that this source of legitimate investment can be smoothly promoted.

With concrete goals and a clear plan of action, there should also be a complete organization in the management of the promotion to be the central hub for control and guidance, so that each small unit can obtain reasonable and good efficiency under unified action. The following is a brief discussion of the points that should be controlled and guided:

Control is the fundamental management of the types and scope of unit activities by the power and methods of a group. The small-unit industrial system is distributed in various places, and if it is not controlled, it will inevitably create a scattered and uncoordinated phenomenon. There are two principles for starting to control the small-unit industrial system: (1) Production control, (2) Raw material control. Production control: is to make the supply and demand of each unit's production adapt to each other, in order to prevent unnecessary waste and imbalance in production. At the same time, it is also necessary to promote the standardization of unit production. This does not only mean that each unit should be standardized, but that the standardization of the entire unit's production should be promoted. The effectiveness of standardization can make: (1) Production accurate, (2) Obtain a huge amount of output with a small number of types to meet the needs of wartime, (3) The affairs of the products can be simple, and the completion of the products can be rapid and excellent, (4) Due to the standard of production, the waste of raw materials and manufacturing costs can be reduced.

The importance of raw material control is greater than production. Wartime production gives priority to military needs. Therefore, the first principle of raw material control is that the manufacture of military supplies should have priority in the use of raw materials. For example, if factories A and B use the same raw materials, but factory B is an ordinary factory, and the products of factory A are for military needs, then factory A should have priority in the use of that raw material. During wartime, if the raw materials of military industries are not controlled, and important production is given priority, it will greatly hinder military affairs. Take the United States during the European War as an example. After the United States entered the war, it set 60,000 items of military supplies and military raw materials for the industrial areas in the east. Among this huge number of items, their military value varied from large to small, from urgent to slow. However, due to the lack of control, often those with small military value or slow need were produced first. And the urgent military supplies could not be manufactured due to the lack of raw materials. As a result, the wartime production in the United States at that time fell into a state of extreme chaos. Therefore, at this extraordinary time, our country cannot ignore the control of raw materials, otherwise the impact will be no small matter for military affairs.

Secondly, guidance and improvement are also very important. Guidance is a reasonable inspiration, and improvement is the starting point for advancement. Under this wartime state, in order to increase the total national production, the government has the necessity to control production and raw materials, and should also give guidance and improvement to everything inside production. This can be divided into operation, organization, labor, and machinery. Regarding operations: (1) Reasonable guidance on operating methods and improvement of production technology; (2) Whether the division of labor and cooperation system of operations is suitable; (3) Reasonable allocation of operation time and rest time should be given; (4) The connection of efficiency between people and projects. Regarding organization: (1) Guidance on the organization system, (2) Division of industrial and administrative affairs; Regarding labor: (1) Implementation of improving the lives of workers; (2) Guidance on the actions of workers; to make the actions of workers simple, reduce fatigue, and seek to strengthen work efficiency. (3) Discovering the shortcomings of workers in manufacturing, and improving and guiding them in methods. In summary, at this extraordinary time, strengthening the production mechanism is our country's current urgent task. The production of large-scale development of small-unit industrial system is as important as large enterprises. And its advantages are better than large enterprises, and it can closely meet the wartime environment. Therefore, promoting the small-unit industrial system is the path that our country's wartime industrial construction should take today.

Editor's note: Promoting the construction of small-unit production system is indeed the main objective, but there are still two points that seem to be neglected by the author: (1) the acquisition of small machines. The construction of small-unit production system is to consider that large industries are controlled by the enemy, or not adapted to the production situation in the interior. Therefore, its nature is between handicraft industry and machine industry. Recently, people in the interior have also realized this. Do not see that this newspaper often has letters asking about small flour milling machines and spinning machines? However, how to manufacture this kind of machinery and where to obtain it are also prerequisites for the construction of small-unit production. (2) The areas occupied by the Japanese army are mostly cities. Therefore, the industry in the cities is often occupied and controlled. If you want not to be used by them, you can only move to the countryside. However, building small industrial units in the countryside, protecting and nurturing them, depends on the guerrillas. If the guerrillas cannot take this responsibility, the result will still be occupied and controlled by others. This is also worth thinking deeply about. Therefore, the responsibility of the guerrillas is not only to destroy the enemy's work, but also to organize and protect the property of the people in the guerrilla area, and to promote their construction, so as to be the foundation for the revival of the national industry in the future.

Industrial and Commercial Discussion

### Recent Popularity of Brazilian Cotton on the Market

— Di Xuan

In the past, due to the low domestic cotton production and high consumption, it was necessary to import a large amount of foreign cotton to make up the deficiency. As late as 1934, this reached a huge 3.7 million dan (a unit of weight). Subsequently, the central government and various provinces actively improved cotton cultivation, and foreign cotton imports were drastically reduced. In recent years, they have been less than 500,000 dan, roughly balancing with exports. After August 13th, most of the textile factories stopped work, cotton consumption greatly decreased, and cotton imports were almost completely cut off. Unexpectedly, since November of last year (1938), Shanghai textile factories have purchased a large amount of foreign cotton. The main reason for this is that cotton from the provinces of Hubei, Henan, Shandong, and Shaanxi cannot be transported to Shanghai. The only sources are the cotton produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and a small amount of cotton exported from Tianjin. Due to inconvenient transportation, extraordinarily high transportation costs, and increased costs, the price of this cotton has greatly increased. Foreign cotton, on the other hand, has abundant reserves and has fallen to the lowest prices. Although foreign exchange has greatly shrunk, its converted price is close to the Shanghai cotton price, and sometimes even lower, which has led to a sudden surge in foreign cotton trading that has been dormant for a long time. This is particularly detrimental to the national economy in wartime.

Traditionally, my country's imported foreign cotton has included American cotton, Indian cotton, and Egyptian cotton. Recently, there has been a sudden increase in Brazilian cotton. Brazilian cotton production has not been well-known in the past, and my country's imports have been particularly small. Now it is suddenly on par with American and Indian cotton. Looking at this newspaper's current cotton transactions, Brazilian cotton exceeds a thousand bales, not inferior to American and Indian cotton, and even more so than Egyptian cotton. The cotton industry is quite surprised by this phenomenon, and their knowledge of Brazilian cotton is not very extensive. According to my observations, under the current circumstances, the import of this type of cotton can be sustained for a long time. Therefore, I will briefly describe the general situation of Brazilian cotton for the reference of the cotton industry.

Brazilian cotton production was not well-known in the past. In 1933, it was less than 500,000 bales, just enough to meet domestic demand. After that year, the government actively promoted cotton cultivation, and cotton field production increased dramatically. In the 1933-34 season, it increased to 1 million bales (each bale weighing 478 pounds). In the 1935-36 season, it increased again to 1.765 million bales, more than tripling in three years. In 1936-37, it was 1.712 million bales. In 1937-38, it increased again to 2.203 million bales, more than 4.5 times the increase from 1933. The speed of progress in cotton production is truly astonishing. Judging from its growth rate, it will soon be on par with our country. Northern Brazil is the most extensive, with the Amazon River crisscrossing it, but due to the humid climate, it is not suitable for cultivation. Therefore, cotton cultivation is entirely in the south. In terms of its cotton-growing areas, it can be divided into northern and southern parts. The development of cotton cultivation is most prominent in the south. In 1931-32, the south produced 126,000 bales, and the north produced 429,000 bales. By 1937-38, the south produced 1.404 million bales, and the north produced 787,000 bales. The province with the most cotton cultivation is Sao Paulo on the southern coast, accounting for half of the country's production. The rest are less than one-tenth, so the cotton market center is in Sao Paulo City. What can be said about Brazilian cotton production is the remarkably high yield per acre. In Sao Paulo province, the maximum yield per acre reaches 1,000 English pounds, and 500 pounds is very common. The average yield in the Sorocabana region of the state is consistently 450 pounds. Egypt, known for its highest yield, is only 350 pounds, while our country and the United States are both around 200 pounds, less than half of that. However, the yield in the north is very low, and the national average is not very high. Because the yield per acre in its main cotton-growing areas is very high, and the general wages in Brazil are low, the cost of Brazilian cotton is relatively low. According to reports, the production cost of Mater cotton is about two pence per pound. If calculated at our country's statutory British currency exchange rate, it is only 14 cents. The lowest cost of cotton cultivation in our country is far above this figure, not to mention American cotton. The market price of Brazilian cotton reported in this newspaper is lower than that of American cotton of the same grade, which is probably the reason.

There are two main types of cotton in Brazil: perennial tree cotton and annual cotton. Tree cotton can grow for 15 years and has relatively long fibers. There are also many varieties of herbaceous cotton, mostly American upland cotton varieties. Therefore, the fiber of the cotton produced can be spun into yarn of 100 counts or more, and some are as short as 15mm. Usually, 27 to 35mm is more common. The Sao Paulo province has a grading bureau that divides cotton into nine grades. According to reports, the percentage of each grade of cotton produced in 1936 and 1937 is as follows: "1936" Grade 1: 0, Grade 2: 0.06, Grade 3: 2.64, Grade 4: 14.84, Grade 5: 38.25, Grade 6: 22.75, Grade 7: 17.09, Grade 8: 5.54, Grade 9: 1.17, Sub-Grade 9: 0.44. "1937" Grade 1: 0, Grade 2: 0.32, Grade 3: 6.85, Grade 4: 29.85, Grade 5: 35.41, Grade 6: 17.80, Grade 7: 5.91, Grade 8: 1.75, Grade 9: 2.45, Sub-Grade 9: 0.16. Generally speaking, its ordinary cotton is close to American middling, suitable for spinning medium-count yarns like those in our country, and can replace medium-grade American cotton and high-grade Indian cotton.

The Brazilian cotton spinning industry also has a considerable position. Before the European War, there were 1.2 million spindles in the country. After that, it gradually developed, and recently it has increased to 2.7 million spindles. The raw cotton used is entirely produced domestically, because it has both long and short fibers, so there is no need to seek it abroad. Its cotton consumption was 587,000 bales in the 1934-35 season (each bale weighing 500 pounds), 654,000 bales in 1935-36, 710,300 bales in 1936-37, and 620,000 bales in 1937-38. In addition, general consumption is 70,000 bales. Therefore, Brazilian cotton production was only sufficient for self-sufficiency in the past. In recent years, after the increase in production, it has become surplus and sold abroad. Generally speaking, due to its lower cotton cultivation costs, at a time when American and Indian cotton exports are sluggish, Brazilian cotton exports have increased sharply along with the progress of its production. According to the report of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Brazilian cotton exports, calculated in bales of 180 kilograms each, were 770,000 bales in 1935, 1.113 million bales in 1936, and 1.312 million bales in 1937. Almost all of the cotton produced is exported, except for domestic use. In terms of exporting countries, in 1937, Germany was first with 470,000 bales, Japan was second with 283,000 bales, and the United Kingdom was third with 263,000 bales (360,000 bales in 1936). In addition, France had 70,000 bales, Italy 44,000 bales, and Portugal 40,000 bales. Almost all of the world's major cotton-consuming countries have it. Even the cotton-producing United States had 12,000 bales, and India had 1,000 bales. My country had 11,628 bales in 1936, and it increased to 22,972 bales in 1937. According to the statistical report of the International Agricultural Association on world cotton trade, Brazil has risen to fourth place among exporting countries, second only to the United States, India, and Egypt.

Due to the different climates in the cotton-growing areas of Brazil, the planting and harvesting seasons also vary. In the northern cotton belt, the cotton harvesting period is from August of this year to January of the following year. The south is later, about March to June. Therefore, the "cotton season" in Sao Paulo ends at the end of February, which is very different from the end of the cotton season in July and August in the United States, India, Egypt, and our country. Therefore, the Brazilian government's accounting period for cotton production is different in the north and south. For example, when the first estimate of cotton production in the south is made, the north has already completely completed the third estimate.

The development of cotton cultivation in Brazil is relatively short, and the work on cotton economics is still being actively improved. In the past, roller gins were used for ginning, which had a great impact on quality. Later, the government controlled ginning and switched to saw gins, which greatly benefited the quality of cotton. The government has vigorously implemented grading work. Currently, most of the exported cotton has been graded. Cotton trading methods are also being improved. Some large-scale cotton companies are gradually establishing ginning factories in Brazilian cotton-growing areas to engage in cotton collection. For example, Meian Yoko, which used to operate American cotton in our country, is one of them. In the future, Brazilian cotton trade will become more active both internationally and in our country's markets, and those affected will naturally be American cotton and Indian cotton.

### Finance: Spot Gold Trading Slightly Active

Prices Similar to the Previous Day

Yesterday's spot gold black market was quiet because it was a Sunday holiday, so there were very few gatherings in the market. It was reported that only a certain money exchange shop helped a customer buy 50 taels from a fellow merchant, with the price similar to the closing price of the previous evening. It was also heard that a certain money exchange shop's retail business was slightly active, buying several dozen taels from fellow merchants at a price of 2,021 yuan.

Ornaments: Price of Jewelry Gold Unchanged. The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at gold and silver shops has not changed. Da Tong Hang, Lao Qing Yun, etc. still suspend the original price of 205 yuan, while new shops suspend 203 yuan and buy in at 197 yuan.

### Miscellaneous: Inquiries about Small Spinning Machines: An Uncertain Reply

Since this newspaper requested information about small spinning machines, we have received a letter from Mr. Chen Chuyao requesting to obtain the design of the Mu's 77 small spinning machine. We have also received a letter from a person named Hu Jiyou, stating that the Xin Zhong Xing Machine Factory on Xiaoshadu Road manufactures this small spinning machine. However, what kind of design it is is unknown and can be inquired about there. This letter did not originate from the factory, but from Mr. Hu. Since Mr. Hu does not know what the machine looks like, we dare not say that it definitely exists. Even if this machine exists, whether it is suitable is still unknown.

For this reason, the reporter also consulted friends familiar with the textile industry. According to them, someone mentioned the small hand-spinning machine trial-produced by the Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Institute, which is roughly similar to a type of hand-spinning machine invented by Mr. Xing ten years ago (its description and photos were published in the Textile Times). However, Mr. Xing's machine was not promoted, presumably because there were still shortcomings in the structure. How the Mu's machine is structured is also unknown. However, according to the current inland yarn prices, profit can be obtained even with the most old-fashioned women's hand-spinning methods. Therefore, it is currently difficult to give a definitive answer about this spinning machine. We will disclose reliable information as soon as possible for the reference of those who are concerned about this matter. Liu Tang

Sugar Market: This Factory's Refined White

### 

Follows the decline of Dutch Raw White

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat and soft. According to the guild's calculations, the market sentiment for Dutch raw white grade 24 was very weak after the futures price turned down. Spot prices also fell by 4 jiao, to 24.3 yuan. Transshipment goods fell by another 1 jiao, to 16.3 yuan. This warehouse's goods were 24.5 yuan, and Da Jin Qian grade goods were 24.7 yuan. Dutch red sugar remained unchanged. This factory's refined white sugar, due to the decline in raw materials, also fell by 2 jiao. Zhen Ji No. 1 white was 25 yuan, and grades 2, 3, 4, and 5 remained the same. It is heard that a certain company still has more than 3,000 packages of old stock of Chaoqing, Youbao Huanggangqing, and other goods from the past, and plans to take advantage of the market to sell them all. The asking price may be slightly negotiable.

### Medicinal Materials: Newly Arrived Tangerines Already Selling Well

Tangerines (i.e., raw materials for immature tangerine peel) are produced in the inland areas of Chaozhou and Shantou. They are collected by rural farmers when the tangerines are first formed or when branches fall due to wind, and then dried. The best quality is considered to be heavy and firm. They are purchased in small quantities by local vendors and then sold. Recently, new goods have been abundant. A batch was recently loaded and immediately began selling well. The price for top-grade goods is 16 yuan per dan, middle-grade is 14 yuan, and lower-grade is 12 yuan. The market is stable, and several dozen pieces of old goods have been offered at a price of 9.5 yuan, a small decrease of 2 yuan from before.

### Does the Shanghai Public Need Physical Exercise?

— Qin

Shanghai is the largest city in the East of our country. The life of the Shanghai public is an urban life. The shortcomings of urban life are small housing and polluted air. Therefore, the bodies of urban residents, due to environmental constraints, are not as healthy as the bodies of rural residents; the Shanghai public is naturally no exception.

Physical exercise is needed by the Shanghai public. In the past, the Shanghai local authorities broadcast the commands for public morning exercises on the radio, guiding the public to do a few physical exercises every day before starting work. This method was very good. However, because there were no designated sports venues, group exercises could not be performed, and the results were not significant. It is best to entrust specialists to designate locations in different districts and lead the public in person to engage in exercise, which is easier to achieve results. Now I will put forward a few points below:

(1) Name: Call it "Shanghai Public Physical Exercise," and tentatively set morning exercises as one item. If possible in the future, expand further.

(2) Organizers: Organized by enthusiastic local community groups, preferably the Shanghai YMCA and YWCA.

(3) Venues: Divide the city into several districts, and designate a school playground or open space in each district as a morning exercise venue.

(4) Instructors: One male and one female instructor should be set up in each district.

(5) Exercise time: From 7:00 am every day, for a maximum of one hour, or held every other day.

(5) Exercise program: In addition to stipulating a few morning exercises, a few fitness slogans can be shouted before exercising. After exercising, a fitness song can be sung to make the body and mind feel excited.

We know that only with a healthy body can we have a healthy career. Failure to pay attention to physical exercise not only affects physical health, but also affects the development of a career. It is hoped that the Shanghai public will unanimously advocate and implement it.

### The Pulley—Helping People Work

— Wu Guang

The pulley is usually something that most people are familiar with, but the application of the pulley is not something that most people can fully understand. Now we will use a corner of this publication to talk about the pulley.

Pulleys have great utility in everyday life. They allow people to use very little strength to lift very large objects, and they can raise goods to very high places. Readers have certainly seen goods being loaded and unloaded on ships, right? At the same time, have you also seen the rise and fall of elevators? In fact, the role of the pulley has played a great function in this.

The pulley is constructed of three parts. The first part is the pulley wheel, which is a circular plate with a groove cut around the circumference to accommodate the rope. The second part is the pulley support, which is usually an elliptical block of wood with a hollowed-out center to accommodate the pulley. The two walls support the axis of the pulley to provide support. The third part is the rope, which runs inside the pulley and is used to lift goods.

The origin of the pulley: Initially, if humans wanted to raise heavy objects, they had to first erect a person in the position where the object should be raised, and then use force to lift the object up (as in the first diagram).

However, although this method can reduce some effort, the worker must stand in a very high place, which is very inconvenient. So, a step further was taken with the method in the second diagram. The worker stands below and just pulls the rope, and the heavy object can rise. This is much more convenient than the previous method. However, this method is still not good because the resistance between the rope and the wooden stick is too great, and it is still very difficult to pull. Later, after considerable research, someone invented a rational thing, and that is the pulley.

This pulley is hung high, and the worker only needs to pull the rope, then the goods can be raised easily, and lowered easily, without any effort.

The evolution of the pulley: The above pulley is a "free pulley." It can only change the direction of the force, but it cannot have any mechanical assistance, because if 100 catties of force is applied to one end of the rope, it will also be transmitted to the other end with 100 catties. The reason is that the "fixed pulley" used in the above diagram only pulls the weight of the object with one rope, and the resistance is too great, so it is not very labor-saving. If you can use the "movable pulley" in the fourth diagram, then the force will be even more labor-saving. Because the movable pulley is pulled by two ropes, the resistance is reduced by half, so it only takes one catty of force to pull up two catties of goods. However, according to the movable pulley in the fourth diagram, scientists have studied that although it can have mechanical assistance, the direction of force still needs to be pulled upwards, which is very inconvenient. So, later someone invented a movable pulley, plus a fixed pulley, then the difficulty is solved. As shown in the fifth diagram, one end of the rope is wrapped around the movable pulley, and then wrapped around a fixed pulley. In this way, not only can you get the assistance of the movable pulley, but you can also change the direction of force through the fixed pulley.

It seems that the evolution and improvement of the pulley is quite a bit.

The effectiveness of the pulley: However, there is still room for improvement in the progress of the pulley. For example, wouldn't it be more labor-saving to connect several fixed and movable pulleys together? That's right, as long as you pay attention to the length of the rope and the distance the goods rise, you can get greater assistance from the pulley. There are also several methods of using multiple pulleys in combination.

(1) Each movable pulley is seated on a rope, and one end of each rope is nailed to the frame beam. Except for the first rope, the other end of each rope is wrapped around a movable pulley and connected under the movable pulley in front. The other end of the first rope is wrapped around a fixed pulley and tightly held in the worker's hand. As shown in the sixth diagram, after several turns of 16 catties of goods, the effort required is only one catty.

(2) There is also a device that is more flexible than the previous one, does not take up space, and is simpler and more convenient to use, that is, the device in the seventh diagram. This device is widely used, and until now, it is widely used in transportation and construction sites.

To summarize what has been said above, although the ratio of the length of the rope to the weight of the goods has not been explained in detail, the basic principles of the pulley structure have been generally explained. Nowadays, with the development of science, some people use steel chains instead of ropes, and iron pulleys instead of wooden pulleys, and use gear mechanisms instead of flat wheels, and even use engines instead of manpower. In this way, the function of the pulley is really astounding.

A scientific picture book also published an interesting experiment: Its title is "A Child Pulls Four Strong Men Together." Readers, will you not believe it? It is now introduced below for experimentation.

Four strong men are divided into two groups, two people in each group, each holding a sturdy wooden stick, facing each other. One end of a sturdy hemp rope is knotted on a stick on the right, and then wrapped back and forth around the two sticks for a total of three turns, so that there are six ropes between the two sticks. The last rope that extends out is held by a child, and this can be tested.

Assuming that each of these four strong men has a strength of 120 catties, then this child only needs to use 40 catties of strength to pull the four strong men together. The principle is actually the same as the function of compound pulleys.

### Talking about Education for Refugee Children (1)

— Tang Rongkai

Education is a nation's life vitamin, relating to the entire nation's strength, weakness, survival, and death. Education should be talked about in peacetime, and it should be talked about even more during extraordinary times. Since the outbreak of the August 13th war in 1937, it has created an unprecedented catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands of fellow countrymen in distress have been displaced and gathered on solitary islands. These refugees, the remnants of the catastrophe, although able to maintain a minimum standard of living, but the responsibility we bear for the refugees is so great. Sustenance is for the continuation of life, and education is the food for the spirit. It can be seen how important refugee education is.

Talking about refugee education is indeed not an easy thing. Doing extraordinary education in special circumstances has many difficulties and is not comparable to ordinary education. It is necessary to understand and cope with refugee education in this extraordinary period through practical experience. In terms of measures and experience, a spirit of hard work is required to achieve some results. The author has been serving in refugee education for more than a year, and will talk about the experience gained in general terms, as a reference for a kind of refugee education. There will be omissions, and I hope that knowledgeable people will correct them at any time. (To be continued)

### One Week of War News

The war situation in South China has consistently been more intense than that in Shanxi, as has been proven by facts over the past few weeks.

Not long ago, the Japanese army launched several offensives in the Northwest, building railways and reinforcing troops crossing the river, intending to take advantage of the frozen Yellow River to reach Shaanxi in one go. However, in recent months, these offensives have not succeeded, and their plans have been thwarted by the Chinese army's pre-arranged strategies. The Northwest war situation has recently become quiet. Although it cannot be definitively said that there will be no more battles from now on, in reality, it is very disadvantageous for them to remain inactive.

Therefore, South China is the only good target for them. Expanding the war in South China is quite consistent with their current situation. The terrain is very important, and transportation is very convenient. Even thinking a step back, if the Japanese side wants to threaten Britain and France, and connect with Germany and Italy, it is also an excellent place.

With these reasons, we can select some relevant news for readers to refer to.

"The Japanese army in Guangdong Province continues to reinforce troops. The number of Japanese warships near Weizhou Island has increased to thirteen, including aircraft carriers, destroyers, and two each of transport ships and shallow-water vessels, patrolling the sea and transporting supplies daily."

"The Japanese army in the Sanshui area has been reinforcing troops for days. A part of them has moved along the Xiaobei River. The Japanese army attacking the Yuehan Railway is also planning to attack Sihui, approaching the rear of Zhaoqing obliquely. According to foreign observers, the Japanese army will launch attacks in South China in three routes: one landing in Beihai, advancing north along the highway, and invading southern Guangxi to cut off the connection between Guangxi and Vietnam; one invading Zhaoqing and Wuzhou along the West River; and another may advance circuitously to invade eastern Guangxi and threaten the rear of the Chinese army. The East River will adopt a feigned attack to contain the Chinese forces."

"According to a telegram from Haitian on the 21st, the war near the Yuehan Railway is unusually quiet. Both sides are adjusting their formations. The area from Guangdong Military Field via Huaxian to Conghua is a busy zone for military transportation and movements. The Japanese army on the West River is advancing towards Jinli and Lubao."

"Also, according to a telegram from Hong Kong on the 23rd, several French warships left Haiphong yesterday and sailed to Guangzhou Bay. It is widely believed that this is related to the activities of the Japanese navy in the Qiongzhou Strait. Foreign sources report that the French authorities are closely monitoring the development in the Leizhou Peninsula area, fearing that once a war breaks out there, it will endanger the safety of Guangzhou Bay."

### Education of Love (6)

— Written by Amicis, illustrated by Yunfang

At this moment, the bell rang to end the class, and everyone left their seats and walked out of the classroom. Bi Sheng, who jumped on the chair, walked tremblingly to the teacher, lowered his head and said, "Teacher, please forgive me this time!" After hearing this, the teacher kissed his head and said to him, "Good boy, go back quickly!"

Disaster - What happened?

This morning, my father took me to school. Just as we reached the school gate, we suddenly saw many people gathered together, including teachers, police officers, men, and women. My father said, "Something must have happened."

### Nobel Peace Prize

— Sangzi

Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) was a Swedish chemist who invented dynamite made from nitroglycerin and other substances, becoming immensely wealthy. After his death, he donated most of his property as the principal for the Nobel Prizes, totaling approximately 1.7 million pounds. Each year, the interest from this fund is used to award prizes to the world's top scholars, divided into five categories: 1. Physics, 2. Chemistry, 3. Medicine and Physiology, 4. Literature, 5. Those who have strived for international peace. Each category receives approximately 7,500 pounds annually. Some say that Nobel established this prize to atone for his achievements because he did not expect warmongers to use his inventions to harm their fellow human beings. Although this statement is based on fact, it feels somewhat harsh. We believe that this prize makes a significant contribution to the evolution of human civilization and assists it greatly.

According to a telegram, twelve members of the Swedish Parliament recently suggested to the Norwegian Nobel Prize Committee that the 1939 Peace Prize should be awarded to Chamberlain because in September 1938, Europe was in a precarious situation due to the Czech issue, but Chamberlain's efforts saved it from a great disaster, and his contribution is truly undeniable. (Reuters, Stockholm, 25th)

Yes, Chamberlain, in his old age, carrying an umbrella, flew to Munich twice last autumn and miraculously cleared up the European situation, which was filled with the clouds of war at that time, revealing a glimmer of hope for peace. We cannot say that it was not the success of his realism and appeasement policy. European people were spared from another war disaster, and his contribution is worthy of praise. However, is the crisis in Europe as optimistic as the Swedish parliamentarians feel, and has it now been eliminated? Former British Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Viscount Cranborne, recently stated in Weymouth: "The weakness of Britain's current attitude only brings the war closer. He has not seen any signs of Germany and Italy responding to Chamberlain's peace policy." (Reuters, London, same day) This is an extremely pertinent reply. In other words, Chamberlain's realism and appeasement policy have not only failed to promote peace, but on the contrary, have accelerated the arrival of war. At the same time, Czechoslovakia, because of the Munich Agreement, has completely deprived the Sudetenland region of coal supply. Now, they have no choice but to take emergency measures, supplying Germany with high-speed aircraft engines and aircraft parts to prevent the lack of this fuel. (Reuters, Prague, same day) Therefore, peace has not been achieved, and Czechoslovakia is already feeling the pain of being slaughtered. Who caused this? Who brought this about? Was it not Chamberlain's peace policy?

If we say that the Nobel Peace Prize is to reward the policy of sacrificing the weak, then it is simply superfluous, not to mention that sacrificing the weak cannot exchange the lament of the bellicose fascists, nor can it eliminate the ambition of the bellicose fascists.

### Casual Talk on Tips

— Tingkang

A friend who recently returned from Hong Kong said that he hosted a banquet in a large restaurant there. Because he felt that Hong Kong was more extravagant than before, he used to give ten yuan in tips, but this time he doubled it to twenty. Unexpectedly, the waiters were indifferent and did not care. Later, he realized that since the wealthy old men from Shanghai arrived in Hong Kong, they give tips of at least one hundred or eighty. This made me "very surprised."

In a completely urbanized society, the tip system is developing abnormally. According to a survey by a London income tax officer, a waiter in a pub earns an average of 1,000 pounds in tips each year, which is not considered much, so it is also classified as an "easy money" category, and tips are therefore given extra importance. The income from tips often exceeds the explicitly stated salary by more than one or two times.

In the past, the stewards on the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping lines were famous for receiving tips. For an ordinary second-class cabin seat of two yuan, you would have to give at least two yuan in liquor money. A steward could manage four or five cabin seats, and his average monthly income was five or six hundred yuan, which was really not a small amount. Therefore, many stewards became moderately wealthy because of this (but most developed bad habits of opium smoking and gambling due to the ease of income). Later, state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other ships collected the liquor fees on behalf of the company, and the practice of tipping was slightly curtailed.

According to a person in charge of seating arrangements in a Beijing opera theater, he most welcomed women with children and elderly merchants, who often gave two or three yuan in tips for a one-yuan ticket. Fortunately, some theaters have now abolished the seating arrangement system, so there are no tips at all.

Some people have painfully said that if the tip system is not overthrown, Chinese society will always be so snobbish. However, tracing the origin of tips, it is caused by ourselves. If you give one hundred yuan, and others give twenty yuan, you will inevitably be treated coldly. Naturally, the recipient will not think that both one hundred and twenty are extra, and giving people two different treatments is absolutely wrong.

I also thought of two other things encountered in daily life: going to the barber shop and the bathhouse. For example, the stipulated price for a haircut is two cents, and for a shave is one cent, but some people give four or six cents at once. In addition to the stipulated price, the rest is naturally a tip. He gives you a particularly careful and thorough cut, so you give a little more reward. But unexpectedly, those who pay according to the rules receive discriminatory treatment. Therefore, everyone tacitly agrees to give more than the stipulated amount. The first person sets the trend, and everyone has to follow suit. In reality, it is his duty to give you a thorough cut.

Other things like giving rewards during the New Year, festivals, weddings, birthdays, etc., seem to be disguised tips. When servants deliver gifts to relatives and friends, "they always bring back a few cents or a few yuan as a thank you," can't this be considered a kind of tip?

There are too many examples. This society seems to be surrounded by tips. Although some people rely solely on tips to make a living, I hope that giving tips should not exceed what is reasonable.

### Eunuchs

— Mr. Xiaoyu

I used to keep a cat. Following the advice of the old maid, I had it neutered. Sure enough, the animal grew exceptionally strong, but there was one drawback: after being neutered, it became listless, only knowing how to eat and sleep. It neither caught mice at night nor looked for lovers in the spring.

Opening the Shen Bao of January 25th, who knew that the first headline that caught my eye was a Japanese lawmaker suggesting castration. It is said that the Ministry of Health and Welfare dared not implement this virtuous (?) policy because the people opposed it, which aroused the severe criticism from two members of the Minseito party for their conservatism and uselessness. This eunuch policy is on the agenda of the sacred parliament of the supreme East Asian alliance leader, anti-communist axis, new order inventor, and successor to the first-class power. It is truly civilization to the extreme now.

I don't know if these two congressmen are representatives of the people? Are they seeing the "bosses" (military men) engage in militarism, reverse their actions, and constantly use big hats like "Yamato spirit" and loyalty to the emperor to force the people to bow their heads and obediently serve as cannon fodder to fight against the Chinese, who share the same culture, and still feel that the sacrifice is not thorough enough, wanting to turn the people into a uniform group of dull, neutered cats.

I came up with an idea for the Japanese people, which is to use their own methods to deal with them. For now, it would be better for everyone to rise up and castrate these warlords and politicians who speak with one voice as the warlords first. See if they will be so fierce and evil after they become eunuchs. Furthermore, it would be good to have fewer mixed-up little demons and semi-dummies who act as accomplices to oppress their compatriots in the future.

### The Movement after the Silence of Cultural Street

— Simon

The corner of Fourth Road and Henan Road, lined with bookstores and instrument companies, has always been regarded as a cultural street. In our experience, we know that every year, after the winter and summer vacations, when school starts, Cultural Street is particularly lively, while the rest of the time can be considered a period of silence.

Due to the fact that the education sector on the "isolated island" is leaderless, the vacations of various schools this time are not unified, and there are some differences. Some are within the winter vacation, and some have already started. Therefore, these days, after several months of silence, Cultural Street is active again.

First of all, let's talk about a few big bookstores. The books they publish are more than just one kind, but textbooks are wholesaled in thousands, and the number of sales is much larger than any literary or scientific book. Therefore, they have made a lot of money. Therefore, when the school season comes, every bookstore focuses on textbooks and engages in a competition.

These days, we walked through this Cultural Street, paying attention to what they displayed in their shop windows. They are all textbooks, and other books have disappeared. The words "Books and stationery, sold at low prices" are pasted on the glass windows, and some even use simple advertisements behind the shop window as a backdrop for textbooks.

On this Cultural Street, if we pay attention, both men and women are busy entering and exiting bookstores or instrument stores. Among them, there are also students wearing school uniforms and badges, as well as young elementary school students, either in groups of three or five, or accompanied by their parents, going in to buy books. When they come out, nineteen out of ten people are holding bags of books and stationery, and the pen sellers standing at the door will stare at them and ask, "Do you need a pen?"

Walking into these big bookstores and taking a tour, every counter is crowded with people buying books, and the clerks are sweating profusely, too busy to greet customers. Especially the counter selling textbooks is crowded with several groups of people. The wholesale department is filled with male and female teachers from schools who are in charge of general affairs, busy distributing books. The lively scene is rarely seen at ordinary times.

In the Commercial Press's shop, the area displaying children's books is crowded with children looking at books. China Bookstore has a long table filled with primary and secondary school textbooks, and many people are sitting at the table, silently reading, and some are even taking notes, probably teachers choosing textbooks. World Bookstore has selected many useful and cheap books, stacked as high as pagodas. These bookstores often extend their business hours during the school term.

The shop windows of several stationery and instrument stores have also been renovated, with various stationery, sports equipment, and ice skates neatly stacked. There are also advertisements with neon lights or several watercolor paintings to attract customers' attention. One of them even has two giant paintings of "Snow White" placed in the shop window.

Not only are the new bookstores like this, but the used bookstores are also active. These days, there are several new used bookstores on Wenwen Street, and a lot of new wooden boxes and bookshelves have been added to the old ones. The books are also more than in the past few days, and all the useful school books are displayed in different categories. In the first used bookstore, there are several men and women picking through old books. Undoubtedly, the activity of used bookstores is nothing more than a competitor to new bookstores!

In several magazine companies at the intersection of Wangping Street and Fourth Road, the people flipping through picture magazines are also particularly crowded. Presumably, since it is still the winter vacation these days, people who are walking around Cultural Street will take a look when they pass by the magazine companies. But when you walk in, there will be people with smoky faces at the door asking you, "Do you want pornographic pictures?" "Do you want small photos?" making you feel inexplicably disgusted.

Everything, everything, is that Cultural Street, as the winter vacation is about to end, presents a kind of movement after silence!

### After the Rain, the Sky is Clear

— Bao Tianxiao

Episode 3: Admiring the Remains and Recalling the Old Righteous Man, Opening Literacy Classes and Asking Words of Little Teacher

Miss Jin: "I know! This is because the foundation of society has not been reformed, and there is no way to force it. For example, the three words 'guide,' the noun itself has been ruined. People who hear the noun 'guide' will think of it as a base and dirty profession. But when the folk customs are a little more noble, no one will open a hotel and recruit guides to entertain themselves. Then the bad name of the guide is mostly due to the society at that time that made it degenerate and created its badness. May I ask, what kind of base and dirty profession is there now? At that time, the National Diplomacy Committee also thought that the name 'guide' was not good, and someone suggested changing it to another name. I said at the time, 'It doesn't matter! If someone opens a hotel, or calls for a guide in a dance hall restaurant, I will go. At the very least, I can persuade those bad young people and bad old people to guide them to a good path.' Everyone laughed at my words. Then the three words 'guide' are not bad, so why bother to change them?" He Shuangyu said, "Sister Danyu's words are so pleasant! If the foundation of society is not established well, everything will turn bad. People say: Oranges over the Huai River turn into trifoliate oranges. Why do oranges turn into trifoliate oranges? It is because after crossing the Huai River, its soil is not suitable for planting oranges, so it has to change species. Let's not talk about it! Originally, I always wanted to learn good things, but when I came here, I turned bad. There are also some things that are not good in Europe and America, but China has everything, and most of them are entertainment, gambling, and other things, but China wants to learn everything." He Liyu continued, "Especially our women's clothing can be said to be all imitating Europe and America. Some things are learned well, like cutting hair, freeing breasts, etc., are all correct. But what is the point of wearing high-heeled leather shoes? China's foot-binding for women is a stain on the history of women's circles, and is often ridiculed by foreigners. However, wearing those high-heeled shoes is not necessarily brilliant, making both feet deformed. At that time, the general civilized women in China almost all wore high-heeled leather shoes, and some of them who wore flat-bottomed shoes simply couldn't walk. Secondly, like perming hair, it is also following the Eastern custom, but in various European and American countries, there are various colors of hair, and they only make it curly. Some of them also have naturally curly hair, and they don't have to perm it again, at most they use a comb to curl it. However, like China, the hair of Easterners is uniformly black and straight, but at one time, perming was popular, to learn to be like Europeans and Americans. Sometimes, one's own good hair is permed to a scorched yellow. What does this mean?" (26)

### The Process of Shaw's Play Being Adapted into a Movie (Part 1)

— Zhang Jiafeng

George Bernard Shaw is one of the world's most opposed people to turning his works into films. If his plays were adapted into movies, they would surely be a great success. Therefore, for twenty years, film companies in England, America, France, and Germany have tried every means to buy the film rights to his novels or plays. Whenever a film producer went to ask him, he would always cleverly answer them: "The film rights to each play cost one million pounds. I will only sell my play to you if you make a silent film for the deaf." Or he would say, "The protagonist in my film must be played by Lloyd George (translator's note: a contemporary British statesman)."

Whenever a film producer asked for permission to make a film of his work, Shaw would always sneer and say, "I am famous enough and don't need any films to add to my glory. I am rich enough and don't need your money. So why should I give my work to film producers? They might ruin them and give me unnecessary trouble."

One by one, the film producers were rebuffed like this and didn't want to bother him anymore. Later, this privilege was obtained by a relatively unknown film producer, while all the famous companies failed. Gabriel Pascal, although it is a French name, he was born in Hungary. He is a journalist, writer, novelist, and film producer. He has worked for many film companies in Hollywood, London, Berlin, Vienna, Rome, and Budapest for a long time.

Recently, in Paris, without a penny to his name, he suddenly had an idea and wrote a letter to Shaw, whom he had met on the Adriatic beach two or three years ago, asking for help. The gist of his letter was:

"Sir, perhaps you still remember me. We chatted once in Italy (actually, we chatted for fifteen minutes). Perhaps you still remember that I am now a film producer. I have always been interested in your works, and I am extremely eager to turn one of your plays, especially 'Pygmalion', into a film. Under what conditions will you grant me this privilege? At least, give me one!"

Strangely, Shaw actually remembered this Hungarian and, contrary to his usual habit, gave him a reply. This time, he didn't say anything disappointing like before. He instructed him (Pascal) to find his accountant, "This is a very reasonable person." He is currently traveling in the Netherlands. He told him (the accountant) the address in Rotterdam.

"My only chance is to go to Rotterdam myself!" Pascal said to his only friend in Paris and showed him Shaw's reply letter. "If you can lend me a thousand francs, I can get the film rights to 'Pygmalion' within a week."

### Road Hero Dares to Act Recklessly Detective Film Authority Director: Xu Xinfu's Hat Was Snatched

— Yinsi

Chen Charlie's Second Case Back Home Opens?

Famous director Xu Xinfu, has been focusing on detective works for many years and has long formed a style. Such as "A Jade Horse", "Diamond", "Vigorous Dragon and Tiger" and even the recently screened "Pearl Shirt" and other films have made more contributions, and achieved considerable success. And that reputation as the "authoritative director of detective films," is indeed well-deserved, and can be said to be unique at the time! Yesterday, this debt film director actually "personally went on stage" by chance! Staging a funny drama, the situation is like a detective war is opening.

That day "something happened"! Director Xu's car suddenly broke down, so he took a lot of parts and a spare tire, and hurriedly sat on a rickshaw, busy rushing to a car shop to have it repaired quickly. Unexpectedly, when the car was passing Shantou Road, the new felt hat he was wearing suddenly disappeared and separated from his head. Immediately looking back quickly, he saw a person in short clothes taking it in one hand and running quickly into a narrow alley. Because he had a heavy car part pressed on his legs, it was inconvenient to get out of the car for a while, so he could only "watch the flying swan" in the fast march of the rickshaw driver, and just laughed it off.

The Shanghai vernacular calls this "losing a hat". Although Director Xu's loss was limited, it was also a very interesting opportunity to experiment with detective techniques. As for how the case will develop in the future, will it really motivate his "Chen Charlie" to handle this "second case back home" after "Pearl Shirt"? There is no sign of any movement for the time being, and we have to wait for the analysis of the facts.

In addition, Director Xu was originally employed in the Chinese Special Police Force of the Public Concession, and is also a purely voluntary special patrol officer on shift. The "road hero" dared to "catch flies on the tiger's head"; that is also a very funny joke.

### Re-screening of "The Living Hell of the Western Front"

— Xinren

"The Living Hell of the Western Front" has been screened in various theaters in Shanghai for a long time. These days, it is being screened at the Zhejiang Grand Theater. The prosperity of advance sales is even greater than before. Because of the continuous screening of four shows day and night, before the audience inside the theater had time to exit, the outside was already crowded, often like a bank run. Therefore, the traffic on Zhejiang Road was once blocked the day before yesterday afternoon, and after many detectives arrived at the scene to suppress it, order was maintained and returned to peace. The biggest reason for this enthusiastic situation is actually another manifestation of the public's support for the War of Resistance. Because the content of "The Living Hell of the Western Front" tells the tragic story of the French and German armies fighting fiercely for nine months in 1916, with hundreds of thousands of casualties. After losing famous cities in a row, the French army finally resisted the powerful enemy and won the final victory; which made people feel very happy to see. Under the current environment, it is difficult for domestic films to have their stimulating performances, and everyone has to use alcohol to relieve their sorrows.

There is a need to be happy, so everyone naturally has more special affection for this type of film!

### China's Snow White

### Anecdotes of Child Stars

— By Wen Biao

Dianjie's twin daughters, who first appeared in "Five Blessings Arriving in Battle," have recently met us again in "Five Phoenixes Singing Together." The most lively and beautiful of these five little darlings is Miss Youni. Despite her young age, someone is already planning to marry her. It's the son of a New York businessman, only eight years old. Because he often sees Miss Youni's beautiful image in movies and magazines, he finds her very lovely and moving. So, he boldly wrote her a letter proposing marriage, with the following words:

Dear Youni:

I am the first one preparing to marry you. There is no one in the world who loves you more than I do. In a few years, Roosevelt will retire, and I will succeed him as President. You will be the First Lady. If I ever lead troops into battle myself, you will take over national affairs for me.

Your first husband, Bobing Shang

A reporter asked Shirley Temple, "Are you going to film a color movie?" Shirley replied, "Yes, it's a very happy thing. But there's one thing that worries me a bit, and that's that I have a few moles on my face. I'm afraid the audience will notice them in color films."

### Wu Yonggang Directs "Tears of Flowers"

Four Types of Dancers, Each With Their Own Merits

"Tears of Flowers," soon to be performed by the Shanghai Drama Society, is Yu Ling's masterpiece after "Women's Apartment." This play has even more gimmicks than "Women's Apartment" and is a tragedy about dancers. The famous film director Wu Yonggang has been specially invited to direct it.

The play depicts:

The first type of dancer, the so-called "red dancer," is very popular in the dance hall. She knows how to present herself well, wearing a gray overcoat. Her dance tickets cost two or three hundred, but who knows that behind her, she has a "dry mama" who only recognizes legal tender and doesn't care about face. This makes the "red dancer's" body not free, her actions not free, and even her love not free.

The second type of dancer, the so-called dancer who is not completely red, is just so-so in the dance hall, but still has some gimmicks. But they want both "face" and "lining" (material benefit). Although they have been through thick and thin and made up their minds, they have to "perfunctorily," "reluctantly," "make do," and "compromise" for the sake of face and for the sake of life. So, they suffer great mental pain.

The third type of dancer, the so-called "scatterbrain," is like the "telephone receivers" that are popular in the dance hall. They are confused themselves, and the dance patrons take advantage of them. But they don't care and often "don't put it in their hearts." So, they are deceived and insulted once, twice… countless times. When it really becomes unbearable, they go crazy. But who pities them!

The fourth type of dancer, the so-called "packaged dancer," is exploited like a packaged worker, played with like a little bird. On the one hand, they suffer abuse and beatings from the boss or their family; on the other hand, they can only swallow their anger and be played with by the patrons. These people only know how to collect dance tickets and hand them in, dreaming of a beautiful marriage. But this dream is always destroyed by the dark forces.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (90)

— By Xu Muyun

Singing of an Adopted Son on Stage, Brothers Weeping Below

There is a saying that if you want to get angry, gamble and watch a play. At first glance, this sentence seems to make no sense. Because even a three-year-old child knows that gambling and watching a play are all about entertainment and happiness. Why do I say that you go to gamble and watch a play when you want to get angry? Actually, after I explain the meaning inside, it will be clear. First, let's talk about gambling. No matter if you are gambling on mahjong or dominoes, if you can't draw good tiles or are blocked by the player to your left, or if you encounter the highest hand when you're waiting for a tile, wouldn't you be angry in such a situation? As for watching a play, if you see Yue Shaobao being killed in Fengbo Pavilion or Cao Mengde killing the two princes, wouldn't you be angry? People often throw orange peel teacups at Cao Cao. And isn't it because of the two sentences that the shoemaker said that there is no reason for it?

Being able to act is not only to make you angry, but also to make you cry. Once, when Lao Tan was performing "Sangyuan Jizi" (Adopting a Son in the Mulberry Garden), he suddenly saw a person in the audience weeping loudly on the table. The grief was as if he had lost his parents. A meddling person pulled him aside and asked him if he was having a nervous breakdown. He immediately stamped his feet and said, "Sir, what are you talking about? My crying is because I heard Boss Tan's play and it touched my heart. I discovered my conscience and couldn't help but feel genuine regret. And I want to go home immediately, find my brother, and have a good cry with him." Others saw that he was speaking vaguely and not very clearly, so they repeatedly asked him, "What exactly happened, brother?" It turned out that he had listened to his wife's words and bullied his younger brother for being young, taking all the good family property and forcibly dividing the less valuable real estate and objects to him. Of course, he felt resentful in his heart. As soon as he resisted me with a few words, I immediately showed my elder brother's face and drove him out. The reason for getting angry was to listen to a play to relieve boredom, but who would have thought that Boss Tan's singing and acting could express the true feelings of brotherly love? I sat below and watched and listened, and it was really like thorns on my back, restless every moment.
