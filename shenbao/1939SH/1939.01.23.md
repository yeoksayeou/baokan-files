### Active Guerrilla Activities in Northern Jiangxi; Japanese Troops at Zhuling Suffer Heavy Losses; Guerrillas Take Advantage of Victory to Descend the Mountain and Disrupt the Railway; Extensive Damage to the Nanxun Railway Line

Wanjiabu: Guerrilla forces in various parts of northern Jiangxi have recently united into one, supporting each other. When Japanese troops recently besieged the Chinese Lushan guerrilla forces, the Chinese Minshan guerrilla forces repeatedly attacked the rear of the Japanese troops, making it impossible for the Japanese troops to attend to both the front and the rear. On the 19th, in order to ensure the safety of their rear, the Japanese troops divided their forces to put pressure on Zhuling, north of the Chinese Minshan. The Chinese army had pre-arranged an ambush at the foot of the mountain, and when the Japanese troops approached, they were attacked. The Japanese troops were greatly defeated, suffering more than fifty casualties. The Chinese also captured five Japanese heads and a large number of other military supplies. On the afternoon of the 20th, the Japanese troops reinforced with more than 300 men and four artillery pieces, attempting to counterattack. The Chinese Zhuling defenders vowed to resist to the death, engaging in several hand-to-hand combats. A certain commander of the Chinese guerrillas personally went to the front line with a certain battalion commander to direct the battle. After fierce fighting until dusk of that day, the Japanese troops were completely defeated. The Japanese troops fled in disarray, leaving behind dozens of bodies.

The overall relief measures have been decided upon by convening a relief committee, roughly to establish work-relief zones, using work as a substitute for relief. In the future, land will be allocated, and the environment must be carefully observed to find suitable locations. Twenty million yellow disaster refugees have received relief, and they are now moved to the upper reaches of the Yellow River to cultivate, and their lives should be stable.

Jinhua: The Chinese army that crossed the river to counterattack Hangzhou has recovered Fuyang and Yuhang.

Therefore, the Japanese troops stationed in Hangzhou are extremely panic-stricken. The Japanese troops have made preparations to withdraw, but transportation on the Beijing-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines is under the control of the Chinese army, so the Japanese troops are trapped in a large encirclement. (Dispatch, 22nd)

### Chinese Troops on the Border of Shaanxi Have Strict Defenses

(Hong Kong) Shaanxi Electric: The fighting in western Shanxi is easier to defend because the Yellow River has not yet frozen.

Editorial

### A Review of Speeches by Japanese Cabinet Members

The annual meeting of the Japanese Diet opened the day before yesterday. Cabinet members, starting with the Prime Minister, attended the meeting as usual, each outlining their aspirations according to their respective positions. Traditionally, Japan has regarded the beginning of each year as a political season, and the Diet has been the center of attention, both domestically and internationally. However, now that the military cliques are rampant and the political parties have declined, the Diet is like a sacrificial sheep, merely a timely and decorative ornament in the political paraphernalia. Reflecting on the past and present, how can one not sigh? And the impact is not only the misfortune of one country and one event. The hope for restoring the old order lies only after China's victory in the War of Resistance! Nevertheless, the Cabinet members' speeches in the Diet were not intended solely for the members of the Diet. The moribund atmosphere of the Diet is precisely because of the overbearing authority of the Cabinet. Therefore, in-Diet speeches, regardless of whether their content is true or false, are, in their essence, materials that should be paid attention to. Moreover, in wartime, speeches involving the Far East are particularly numerous!

Telegrams reported the speeches of four Japanese cabinet members the day before yesterday: Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Navy Minister Yonai. Details of Yonai's speech were not reported. Itagaki's speech is worth mentioning: he said that Chinese troops west of the Pinghan Railway numbered 170,000; between Changsha and Nanchang, 300,000; in Guangdong Province, 200,000; in Guangxi Province, 150,000; and in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, 210 divisions, numbering 1,000,000. The true magnitude of the Chinese army is another matter; the Japanese estimate for the aforementioned regions is as follows. Other areas, such as the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Jinpu Railway, and the vast and expansive guerrilla warfare zones inside and outside the Great Wall, as well as the reserves of potential strength in Shaanxi, Gansu, and other northwestern hinterlands, are all beyond the scope of his calculations.

The speeches of Hiranuma and Arita should be the focus of world attention, but they offer no new insights; they are empty, superficial, outwardly fierce but inwardly weak. Perhaps this symbolizes the national strength of an invading country that has engaged in prolonged expeditions with no success? To summarize the two men's words, they revolve around the so-called "New Order," and the rest, such as using puppet organizations as the so-called "new Chinese government," using opposition to communism as a cliché for invading China, and using the distribution of spoils as bait to cater to aggressors, are all tired and discredited clichés that the world has long been weary of. If the telegrammed speeches fully represent their essence, then the speeches have no value at all. However, there are some noteworthy points: given the recent tough attitude of the United Kingdom and the United States toward Japan, Hiranuma and Arita were vague in their statements, and did not dare to explicitly name the UK and US, to avoid provoking them. While repeatedly claiming to be anti-communist, they only relied on the German-Italian agreement to bolster their position, and said that their dispute with the Soviet Union was only about mining rights and fisheries. Given the hesitancy and uncertainty of French Indochina, and the fact that Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun had just criticized it at the League of Nations Executive Council, Arita singled it out as a target of criticism, saying: "If the transport of military supplies to China from French Indochina continues, Japan will decide to take appropriate action." Comparing this with the attitude towards several countries, the degree of lightness and emphasis is difficult to compare. Is it love or hate? Is it profit or harm? Considering history and reality, it would not be wrong to say that the feelings of gratitude and resentment are reversed. Why is this? By observing their bias, one can glean the helpless mood of the Japanese authorities. Offending the public, the situation is deteriorating day by day, with nothing to comfort its people, and yet wanting to show the people that it is not weak externally, they deliberately put on a fierce face, pretending to have the courage to "decide to take appropriate action." Knowing full well that China's international transportation does not rely on a single route; empty threats will not help, cutting off transportation is beyond their ability, and attempting it would incur the wrath of the powerful, they avoid the real and focus on the empty, only mentioning Annam. However, it is not entirely without other intentions. Today, Japan's greatest concern in the international arena is the cooperation of democratic nations. If it has the ability to make the nations not plot against each other, and stay out of it, then Japan would be more able to act without restraint. Singling out Annam is simply a small test of the strategy of divide and conquer among the democratic nations on diplomacy. Moreover, with the anti-communist agreement as a link, Japan, Germany, and Italy seem to be one entity. The German-Italian axis in Europe is plotting to alienate England and France, and concentrating arrows at France. Japan's criticism of France is also to show Germany and Italy an echo. From a military strategy perspective, the Japanese navy covets China's Hainan Island most eagerly, drooling with desire, but cannot help but be wary of France. Therefore, today's criticism of France is precisely to lay the groundwork for occupying Hainan Island in the future, which is not known either.

The speeches of Hiranuma and Arita were in the Japanese Diet; those watching the opening of the Diet included the Tokyo diplomatic corps. German and Italian representatives were probably delighted that the anti-communist agreement could serve as material for the speeches. Soviet representatives probably understood their bluffing and smiled knowingly. Only the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have sent protests as they did, and having heard the Japanese authorities' statements as such, shouldn't they think of how to continue after the protest?

### British Government Continues Economic Aid to China, Providing Some Comfort to Various Circles in China; Chongqing Newspaper Hopes Allied Powers Will Take Further Action Against Japan

(Chongqing) The news reported by the London Daily Mail that the British government will provide China with a loan of 3 million pounds to support the Chinese legal tender, and that the arrangements are nearing completion, may slightly reduce the disappointment felt by various Chinese circles regarding the resolution passed by the League of Nations Council. According to the Central Daily News, this loan is a sign of more active British aid to China. (Reuter, 22nd)

(Chongqing) Today, senior Chinese government officials, in discussions with an Associated Press reporter regarding the "Daily Mail" report from London about the British loan to China, expressed great optimism. However, officials close to H.H. Kung were unwilling to make any comments, stating that they had no authority to inform about the loan. Financial circles seemed to believe that the British loan to China would definitely succeed, although the exact amount was still unknown. Observers pointed out that the loans from the United Kingdom and the United States to China are a gesture of opposition to Japan's military aggression against China. (AP, 22nd)

(Chongqing) Today, various Chinese newspapers commented that the French government, following the United States and the United Kingdom, sent a note to Japan, which was delivered to the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 19th of this month. The full text of the French note has not yet been published, but according to a Havas dispatch from Paris on the 18th, responsible figures in Paris stated, "The French government declared in this note that any unilateral action to revise the Nine-Power Treaty is not acceptable to France. The 'new order' that Japan seeks to establish in China contradicts this treaty and is sufficient to harm the rights held by France, which France cannot condone." According to the above dispatch, the content of the French government's note to Japan is roughly the same as the content of the notes from the United States and the United Kingdom to Japan. The main points are: (1) Any unilateral action to revise the Nine-Power Treaty by force cannot be recognized. (2) Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia" contradicts the Nine-Power Treaty and is sufficient to harm the rights held by the signatory nations, which will not be tolerated. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, important signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, have made their attitudes clear. Their understanding of the Far Eastern issue is extremely clear and accurate. However, they are simultaneously taking similar actions, warning Japan with a frank attitude and resolute language. This resolution is still the first resolution. This is the first instance of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France taking parallel action, which is sufficient to prove that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are prepared to shift from passive protests to active measures in order to uphold the Nine-Power Treaty and restore the international order, justice, and peace in the Far East. The governments and peoples of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France feel that Japan's illegal aggression and destructive treaty behavior in the Far East cannot be stopped by protests alone. They must frankly and resolutely state their position and try to take active action, and such active action must be parallel in order to be effective. Among the important countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty, in addition to China, which is at the forefront, the first to be mentioned should be the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Japan, while Italy is not included. We only need to look at the Four-Power Treaty signed by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Japan during the Washington Conference to maintain peace in the Pacific and the Far East, which did not include Italy, and we can know that the most important countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty are only the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Japan. Now Japan unilaterally uses force to destroy the implementation of the treaty and implement an aggressive policy, insisting that the Nine-Power Treaty is no longer applicable to the current situation and that the treaty must be revised in order to establish Japan's so-called "new order." However, the other important countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty have individually published common views, refuting the Japanese fallacies, believing that (1) the Nine-Power Treaty had achieved the good results expected at the time before the Sino-Japanese Incident; (2) the current situation in the Far East was entirely caused by Japan's informal use of force; (3) the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty are still applicable in fact and in law today; (4) unilateral actions to revise the treaty by force cannot be recognized by any country; (5) Japan's so-called "new order" is completely contrary to the existing and effective charter, and no country can accept it. China is the country at the forefront, and China's opinion is put aside for the moment, but the important countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty, and at the same time are not parties to this incident, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, have all reached a common conclusion through individual observations. This is certainly not accidental. Even other countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty and countries that did not sign the Nine-Power Treaty but have important relations in the Pacific, although they have not sent notes to Japan at this time, their observations and conclusions, with the exception of one or two countries with ulterior motives, are largely consistent with the content of the notes sent to Japan by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. This can be seen from their past statements and actions. The above points are sufficient to prove that Japan's statements are absurd and Japan's actions are illegal. The nations' understanding of the Far Eastern issue is extremely clear, their position is extremely firm, their attitude is frank, and their wording is straightforward. The only thing lacking is active and resolute action. On the one hand, we hope that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France can quickly take active action. On the other hand, we will further strengthen our own efforts to resist Japan, in order to jointly sanction the aggressors in the Far East with countries in the world that love justice and peace and uphold treaty faith, in order to restore international order in the Pacific region.

The purpose of France's note to Japan this time is to safeguard "the rights held by France," but at the same time it is also to maintain international justice and the dignity of the charter. We would like to express our deep gratitude to the French government and people. France is indeed worthy of being a great country that loves freedom and peace, worthy of their ancestors in the era of the Great Revolution. France is now in a rather difficult situation in Europe, but it cannot ignore its position and interests in the Far East. Punishing one as a warning to a hundred, the result of France's cooperation with the United Kingdom and the United States in the Far East may be conducive to the peaceful resolution of European issues. Japan is the weakest link in the alliance of aggressors. To restore international order in the world, we must start with sanctioning Japan. (Telegram, 22nd)

### Chinese Official Comments: Arita's Speech Combines Intimidation and Enticement; Allied Powers Will Never Be Moved by It

(Chongqing) Chinese officials are unwilling to criticize the speeches of Hiranuma and Arita in the Japanese Diet in Tokyo, saying that they only repeated statements about organizing a new order in East Asia. However, it is pointed out that Arita's words should be regarded as a continued disregard for the position of the United Kingdom and the United States, ignoring the recent tough notes submitted to Japan by the United Kingdom and the United States. On the other hand, Arita also tried his best to intimidate France and the Soviet Union. Neither the United Kingdom nor the United States can believe Japan's sweet talk, and neither France nor the Soviet Union will be threatened by Japan's bluster. Japan has repeatedly resolved to protest to France about the transportation of munitions from Vietnam. If Japan makes such threats again, it only shows that it regards the entire civilized world as an enemy. France and the Soviet Union are both member states of the League of Nations and are willing to abide by the League of Nations' resolution to help China resist military aggression. France and the Soviet Union will never yield to Japan's verbal intimidation. (AP, 22nd)

### France Resolves to Maintain Transportation Between China and Vietnam; Policy Remains Unchanged

(Paris) The outside world is not criticizing Foreign Minister Arita's threat in the Diet yesterday that Japan will take retaliatory measures against France, and it is not believed that France intends to change its policy of transportation between Annam and China. (AP, 22nd)

(Paris) Rumors that the French government has prohibited commercial trucks and Red Cross ambulances from being transported to China via French Indochina have been denied by responsible persons, stating that the government did indeed temporarily ban trucks from being transported to China via French Tonkin after the fall of Guangzhou, China, in early November of last year, in order to avoid excessive congestion at the port of Haiphong, but it immediately restored the original situation, which has been more than two months. As for the transportation of Red Cross ambulances to China, it has never been restricted in any way and special measures have been taken to facilitate it. (Havas, 22nd)

(Hong Kong) According to a dispatch from Paris, the newspaper Ordre reported that Mr. Pavereau, president of the Hanoi Chamber of Commerce in French Indochina, recently returned to the country and expressed his opinions to the Colonial Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, and made suggestions on the situation of commerce in the Far East, which has aroused deep impressions. The members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies have also requested Mr. Pavereau to submit a report. Mr. Pavereau said that this return to the country is intended to express the appropriate views of Vietnamese merchants and provide various information to members of Congress to make it easier for them to complete their supervisory tasks. In terms of the Far Eastern situation, the war between China and Japan has been going on for eighteen months. Although the two sides have not formally declared war, all important ports in China have been occupied by the Japanese army. In terms of French law, since a state of war has not been formed between China and Japan, third countries have no reason to maintain neutrality and prohibit private arms sales. The Vietnamese government still allows merchants to transport coal and iron ore sand to Japan, for this reason. Since the transportation of Vietnamese goods to Japan is recognized as normal and legal, the Vietnamese government should give the same treatment to the transportation of goods to China. At a time when a railway is being planned between British Burma and Yunnan, China, if the Vietnamese authorities insist on their original policy, it is tantamount to strangling their commercial premises. (Telegram, 22nd)

### Japan's Environment Gradually Becomes Unfavorable; Observations of Various Newspapers

(Berlin) The current diplomatic and military position of Japan has recently been commented on by various German newspapers. Among them, the Frankfurter Zeitung said, "Judging from the various decisions recently taken by the United States government, Japan's environment is extremely pitiful." The United States authorities have now decided to set up fortifications on islands in the Pacific, so Japan is in danger of being militarily surrounded. Moreover, the actions of the United States are not limited to this. For example, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France sent a tough note to Japan. Secondly, the United Kingdom and the United States lent funds to China. All of this is clearly and obviously unfavorable to Japan. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung published a map indicating the various naval bases that the United States government intends to expand, and said, "According to the policy set by President Roosevelt, it can be seen that the United States intends to advance towards the southeast. This threat to Japan is particularly obvious. Tokyo is therefore greatly shaken. The will of the Washington government is to exert great pressure on Japan. This cannot be opposed by the American people. Since internal disputes in the Soviet Union have emerged one after another, leading to a weakening of national strength, its actions to attack various omnipotent countries, that is, the signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact, have been replaced by the United States." (Havas, 22nd)

### The Times Warns Japan

(London) A well-known commentator, writing under the pseudonym "Reviewer," published an article in the Sunday Times today, arguing that the terms offered by Japan to China are unacceptable to the United Kingdom and the United States. He said that the British note to Japan carefully explained that the United Kingdom did not insist on any treaty text. If Japan values the friendship between the two countries, this note actually gives it an opportunity to restore friendship. We should explain to the world that the cause of peace does not depend on the ability of any country or coalition of powers to preserve the past, present, and long-term political status. We may even be willing to concede that Japan is a natural partner of China, but Japan must completely change its attitude, helping rather than bullying the weak, and must replace the despotism of the warlords with higher ambitions. Japan should not ignore the close agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States on the Sino-Japanese issue, because the United Kingdom and the United States should do so for China and for themselves. Japan should not forget that the United States has always been extremely friendly to China and pays more attention to the Pacific than the Atlantic, just as the Monroe Doctrine places the United States in the position of the combined protector of Canada. The existence of the Philippines makes the United States a natural ally of the United Kingdom in Australia and Hong Kong to resist foreign aggression and protect national rights to resist tyrannical forces. The last paragraph of the article analyzes the position of Germany and Italy on the Far East in detail, acknowledging that they are allied countries, but their position is not very bright. The article concludes that the power of the Anti-Comintern Pact to establish bad habits is too weak and will disappoint one or two of its weaker participants. (Reuter, 22nd)

### Chen Guangfu Is About to Return Home

(Chongqing) After Dr. Wang Zhengting, the former ambassador to the United States, arrived here, he told important people that the more China resists Japan, the more Japanese discrimination against American businesses in China will increase, and the more American aid to China will increase. It is heard that Chen Guangfu, who is currently stationed in the United States negotiating with the United States on financial and economic aid to China, will depart from the United States before the end of January to report the details of the negotiations to the Kuomintang government. (Reuter, 22nd)

### Japan's Trade with Hong Kong Plummets

(Hong Kong) Today, the Statistics Bureau announced that trade between Japan and Hong Kong in 1938 plummeted, falling from second place to eighth place compared to 1937. In 1938, goods exported from Japan to Hong Kong totaled only 18,781,000 Hong Kong dollars, while in 1937 and 1936, they were both 58,000,000 Hong Kong dollars. In 1938, goods shipped from Hong Kong to Japan totaled 3,319,000 Hong Kong dollars, while in 1937, they were 19,780,000 Hong Kong dollars. (AP, 22nd)

### Foreign Trade in Yantai Sharply Decreases

(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources, since the Japanese authorities implemented regulations restricting imports and exports and foreign exchange regulations in Yantai on the 1st of this month, Yantai's foreign trade has sharply decreased. All matters such as wharves and port affairs in Yantai, which were previously handled by the Chinese Customs, have recently been taken over by the Japanese. (Special Telegram, 22nd)

### Public Groups in California, USA, Prevent Scrap Iron from Being Shipped to Japan; Set Up Picket Lines to Patrol the Coastline; Dockworkers Also Unanimously Refuse to Handle It

Long Beach, California Thousands of picketers, composed of 55 organizations in California, including at least 1,500 overseas Chinese, are continuing to patrol the coastline to prevent scrap iron from being loaded onto Japanese ships. Dockworkers have also unanimously refused to handle it. The various groups participating in the picket work are now taking unified action with Stimson's "Association to Oppose Aiding Japanese Aggression." The picketers patrolling the coast are holding high flags denouncing Japanese aggression against China and demanding that the United States immediately ban the transportation of raw materials and munitions to Japan. As a result of the strict prevention by the picketers, as much as 12,000 tons of scrap iron that was to be shipped to Japan has not been transported. One Japanese ship and one Norwegian ship, which are unable to depart, are still staying here. The picketers have now brought cots and portable stoves to the coast in order to stay here for a long time and prevent the scrap iron from easily escaping. According to merchants involved in this trade, scrap iron cannot be used to make military equipment and is purely for Japanese public works construction. However, the picketers do not pay any attention to this kind of sophistry and still insist on their work of preventing shipment. (AP, 22nd)

### Japanese Planes Raided Weinan Yesterday; Foreigners Extremely Outraged by the Bombing of Kuling

(Xi'an) Fifteen Japanese planes were discovered at Daqingguan at 9:50 a.m. on the 22nd and then flew southwest in batches. Xi'an immediately issued an alarm and took strict precautions. The Japanese planes passed through Chaoyi and Dali and invaded the airspace over Weinan County at 10:10 a.m., dropping more than 30 bombs in the vicinity of the West Gate and the train station of the city, destroying more than 50 civilian houses and killing and injuring more than 30 civilians. At 10:30 a.m., the Japanese planes flew northeast in batches. (Telegram, 22nd)

(Nanchang) The bombing of Kuling by Japanese planes on the 16th has caused great outrage among foreigners on the mountain. Yesterday, various groups, including the Methodist Church, the Anglican Church, and the China Inland Mission on the mountain, as well as Dr. Du, the representative of the United States, and Mr. Grelison (transliteration), the representative of the British, jointly telegraphed the province, requesting that it be forwarded to the American Embassy in Chongqing to report that the Japanese planes bombed indiscriminately and wantonly that day, dropping a total of more than 20 bombs. Dr. Du's residence was completely destroyed and British property was also damaged. (Telegram, 22nd)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese reports, yesterday 16 Japanese planes flew to bomb various cities in northern Shaanxi, as well as Yan'an and Luochuan, injuring dozens of civilians. (AP, 22nd)

(Chongqing) Regarding the Japanese accusation that the British in Kuling were helping Chinese guerrillas, British officials said that they had not heard of it, saying that it was "extremely unlikely." Regarding the foreigners injured in Kuling, British and American officials did not know their names. It is known that No. 41, Yanhong Road (transliteration), the property of British missionaries, No. 44, the property of German missionaries, the houses of the American Methodist Mission, and the property of the American Church were all bombed, but it is still unknown who lives in and owns these houses.

### Japanese Soldiers' War Weariness Is High; Saburo Yamada Writes an Anti-War Song; Arrested After Incident; Subjected to Torture

Quanzhou According to a Japanese air defense radio squad leader, Saburo Yamada, in a certain foreign building in Xiamen, who graduated from university and worked in a bank, was conscripted into the army after the Japanese warlords launched their invasion of China. Yamada, as an intellectual youth, witnessed the tragedies of war and sang about anti-war. The matter was heard by the Japanese Naval Headquarters and he was recently arrested and subjected to torture. His anti-war song cursed the warlords with gnashing of teeth and hatred. The lyrics are sad and are translated and recorded as follows: "From the same race and culture, we were originally brothers, but the demon warlords have created bottomless hatred. Charge and slaughter, millions turned to ashes. Heaven, how can punishment not descend on the devil's hands? The blue sky and white sun shine on the earth, when will the blue clouds of world peace unfold? Countless blind eyes are unfolding in the midst of artillery fire. Beloved wife, we want to lean our heads together and be intimate, but this life will be difficult to see again." (Telegram, 20th)

### Spanish War Situation Changes; Barcelona in Danger; Rebel Army Advances Rapidly, Only 22 Miles from the City; Britain and France Confer on Possible Impact of the Situation

(London) According to Burgos Radio today, the National Army, which is advancing rapidly towards the metropolis of Barcelona, has occupied the new village and the town of Gieltro, 22 miles from the metropolis of Barcelona in the southern section of the current battlefield. According to a Reuters special correspondent, after the National Army occupied the town of France, 22 miles west of Barcelona, it was able to control the Penedès region, the most agriculturally rich area of Catalonia. The vanguard sentry of the National Army division has now advanced to outside the village of La Pobla, and advancing southeast along the Noya River, has occupied an important bridgehead on the river. The government army was caught off guard, hurriedly retreated, and did not blow up the bridge. At the same time, according to news from Barcelona, civilians in various villages and towns near the front line and in Barcelona itself have now been ordered to rush to build fortifications. Barcelona was subjected to a total of eight air raids yesterday. The National Army's bombing paid great attention to the coastal highway leading to France. (Reuter, 22nd)

Lleida The Spanish National Army camped in the new village last night, which is only 20 miles from Barcelona. The new village is the last line of defense defended by 25,000 government troops. According to the latest report, this line of defense is the last reserve force of three divisions on the government side. The front line starts in Manresa, north of the coast, and stretches for 34 miles. It is now blocking the National Army, which is advancing along three highways to encircle it, but the National Army is progressing rapidly and has advanced to points less than 20 miles from its destination along the entire front line. Yesterday, the National Army Mixed Corps crossed the Belushi Pass, which is an ancient battlefield where Napoleon lost thousands of soldiers a hundred years ago. (Reuters, 22nd)

(Paris) News last night said that men in Barcelona and cities along the Catalan line, regardless of age, have been drafted into the army to serve in the front lines. Trenches and barbed wire and other fortifications are being built day and night there, and local authorities are responsible for handling mobilization matters. (Haitong, 22nd)

(London) As the National Army, led by General Franco, is rapidly advancing and approaching Barcelona, a diplomatic correspondent for the Observer has written an article discussing the possible impact of the victory of the Spanish National Army on German and Italian diplomacy. It is said that the British and French governments have discussed the possible impact of the National Army's victory, and both countries acknowledge its possible impact on France. Now, there is no need to fear that Germany and Italy will gain a strategic foothold in Spain, because it is generally believed that Franco's troops are the National Army, Hitler's troops are Germans, and Mussolini's troops are Italians. It is not even necessary to fear that Germany and Italy will provide aid to reconstruction and gain financial and economic power in Spain or supply military equipment to enable Spain to participate in the general arms race. However, the correspondent believes that it is possible that France, in addition to defending its border with Italy, will also need to defend its border with Spain. Germany will use this point as a motivating force for its diplomacy. Italy may use its "withdrawal" from Spain as a pretext to re-demand Tunis and Djibouti. Although Mussolini has given special guarantees to respect the status quo of the Mediterranean, the strategic interests of the United Kingdom and France in the entire Mediterranean may be affected. (Reuter, 22nd)

### Rebel Planes Attack; Air Battles Occur; Three Aircraft Shot Down

Barcelona Last night's war report from the Spanish government army stated that the National Army, with the help of tanks, aircraft, and artillery, launched a fierce attack on the Catalonia front all day long. The enemy army lost two bombers and two fighter planes. (Haitong, 22nd)

(Paris) The National Army Air Force flew to bomb Barcelona several times yesterday. The most serious one was in the afternoon, with 15 three-engine bombers and several squadrons of fighters discovered over Barcelona, dropping a large number of bombs and causing significant damage. The exact number of deaths and injuries has not yet been ascertained. The cities of Valencia and Gandia were also attacked by the National Army Air Force. (Haitong, 22nd)

### Between Two Great Powers: Poland's Difficult Situation; Leaning Towards Germany or Russia on a Precarious Path; German Foreign Minister to Visit Warsaw

Warsaw - According to reliable sources of the Haitong News Agency, the planned meeting between Polish Foreign Minister Beck and Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov is unlikely to materialize. Political figures believe that Poland's motive for abandoning this meeting is to preserve the friendship between Germany and Poland and to avoid giving Germany the impression that Poland is approaching the Soviet Union, which would create a negative impression. The Polish ambassador to the Soviet Union was ordered to inform Litvinov of Foreign Minister Beck's recent remarks in Munich and to explain the significance of Ribbentrop's upcoming visit to Poland, in order to avoid misunderstandings on the Soviet side. Like a daughter-in-law caught between two mothers-in-law, Poland's daily situation is indeed similar. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

Warsaw - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to arrive in Poland on the 25th of this month. Foreign Minister Beck is currently suffering from sciatica, and it is hoped that he will recover in time to host the reception. Officials here recently declared that since the European War, Ribbentrop will be the first German Foreign Minister to visit Warsaw. It is reported that he will be accompanied by about twenty members of the Foreign Ministry staff. The Polish authorities have prepared a grand welcome for him. It is also said that the 25th of this month marks the fifth anniversary of the signing of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. Ribbentrop's visit will not only prove that this agreement retains full value, but also demonstrate the suitability of Poland's current foreign policy to the environment. Polish opposition figures have previously criticized Foreign Minister Beck's policies, but now that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is visiting, it can be said that this is a major victory for Foreign Minister Beck, and the opposition's criticism will inevitably collapse. Informed sources said that Foreign Minister Beck had just visited Berchtesgaden in Germany earlier this month for talks with Chancellor Hitler, and no new factors have occurred internationally since then. Therefore, the scope of talks between Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and the Polish authorities will not be too broad. In addition, many foreign newspapers have said that the German Foreign Minister's visit will likely involve discussions with the Polish authorities on the issue of border revisions, but local newspapers have denied this, saying that it is purely speculative and not credible. The current borders of Eastern European countries will become more stable due to Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit. As for 1939 being the year of colonies, there are indeed many in Poland who hold this view. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)

### German-Czech Talks

(Berlin) According to authoritative sources, the meeting between Chancellor Hitler and the Czech Foreign Minister did not discuss any major issues such as the German-Czech customs union, Czech participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact, or Ukrainian autonomy. This meeting only considered the Czech government's current main political issues and explained Germany's position on each issue. Political figures said that Germany's position was clearly defined on each issue. It is widely believed that the issue of anti-Soviet propaganda throughout the Czech Republic may have been raised for discussion. Germany hopes that Czech internal unity and stability will make it easier to establish relations between Germany and the Czech Republic. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

### Italy Encourages Hungary and Yugoslavia to Reconcile; Ciano's Diplomatic Success

(Rome) After Foreign Minister Ciano visited Yugoslavia and repeatedly urged the country to reconcile with Hungary, the Italian Daily, a semi-official organ, reported, "Yugoslavia and Hungary will soon sign a non-aggression and friendship agreement, and convene an economic conference to develop bilateral trade relations. Hungary will then follow suit and dispel suspicions and make peace with Romania. It can be seen that the relationship between the countries of the Little Entente and the Rome-Berlin Axis has recently become closer." (Havas News Agency, 22nd)

### Italian Foreign Minister's Hunting Success; Seven Red Deer and Sixty-Four Pairs of Wild Hares

Capital of Yugoslavia - The Yugoslav government set up a hunting club in the Belje area to entertain Ciano. Ciano is proficient in shooting and hunted seven red deer and fourteen wild hare burrows. He then returned to the capital of Yugoslavia by special train last night and is scheduled to return to Rome tonight. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

### Lenin's Death; 15th Anniversary

(Moscow) A memorial meeting for the 15th anniversary of Lenin's death was held on the evening of the 21st at the Bauer School Theater here. Representatives from party and Soviet organizations at all levels, Stakhanov and shock workers from various factories in the city, and representatives from scientific, industrial, literary, and artistic circles attended, totaling thousands of people. The theater was completely packed. Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Kalinin, Andreyev, Mikoyan, Zhdanov, Yezhov, Dimitrov, Beria, Shkiryatov, Bulganin, Shvernik, and Yugoslavsky and other dignitaries took the podium at six o'clock. The entire audience stood up in unison and paid warm respects to Stalin, the successor to Lenin's cause. After Zhdanov delivered the opening speech, the entire audience stood up in silence to mourn Lenin. Finally, Shcherbakov, Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party Committee, reported on the historical victories achieved by the Soviet Union in the fifteen years since Lenin's death.

### Expansion of German and Italian Influence; World Peace Threatened; The United States Has a Deep Understanding of the Situation; Military Buildup is Imminent

(Washington) Political figures here, in view of the recent situation in Germany, mostly believe that there is a chance that the European situation will become dangerous again. However, opinions differ as to the direction of Germany's expansion of its influence. Most people, including U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt, believe that the Soviet authorities will temporarily abandon their "eastward policy" and make direct overtures to the democratic countries of the West. The "Christian Science Monitor" said that, generally speaking, American public opinion can ignore Germany's expansion into Central Europe, but one point cannot be ignored, namely, the threat that the Rome-Berlin Axis can pose to the United States. In other words, if the Spanish Nationalists win, the two omnipotent countries, Germany and Italy, will be able to gain a foothold in the Atlantic, which will have a significant impact on the security of the United States. This is also the reason why the government authorities have proposed a huge national defense plan. Generally speaking, the U.S. diplomatic authorities firmly believe that public opinion's understanding of the situation has become increasingly profound. Although the amount of defense spending requested by President Roosevelt from Congress is huge, the pacifists no longer seem to have sufficient power to prevent its passage. Officials commented on the proposal to fortify Guam in the central Pacific, saying that this move has political significance, as President Roosevelt and the State Department want to use it to show that their resolute policy towards aggressor countries has been victorious. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)

### U.S. President Convenes Senior Military Officers to Discuss Military Expansion Plan; May Suggests Training 300,000 Young Men; Hepburn Believes Guam Needs to be Fortified

(Washington) According to news here today, Representative May, Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, will soon suggest to Congress a bill stipulating the training of 300,000 young men. It is widely believed that May's bill has the support of the War Department and the House Military Affairs Committee. The bill stipulates that these 300,000 young men should receive five hours of training per week and must also be responsible for relief work. At the same time, President Roosevelt convened a meeting of senior military officers to discuss a plan for rapid military expansion. The White House claimed that this meeting was purely a "routine meeting," but those who attended the meeting included Secretary of War Woodring, Undersecretary of War Johnson, Chief of Staff Craig, and other senior military officers. (Associated Press, 22nd)

(Washington) According to Republican Senator Hepburn, he firmly believes that Republican senators will unanimously approve President Roosevelt's naval plan. According to Hepburn, if the United States wants to maintain its position as a strong power in the Pacific and wants to provide adequate protection to the Philippines, then the fortification of Guam is imminent. "If we can arm Guam, then Japan will not be able to attack the Philippines, and the United States' position as a strong power in the Pacific will not be lost." Hepburn did not pay attention to Japan's opposition and claimed that he would soon propose a bill in this session of Congress to grant U.S. citizenship to the natives of Guam. He also said that Guam was already armed, but it was dismantled due to the conclusion of the Washington Treaty. Now that Japan has violated the treaty by building defenses on mandated islands, the United States should follow suit and take the same action. Hepburn said that it was a great mistake that the United States did not annex the Gaoshao Islands in the equatorial zone after the Philippine-American War, because these islands were later transferred to the Germans, and after the Great War, they were transferred to the Japanese, which made the United States' position in the Pacific more threatened. (Associated Press, 22nd)

(German Consul General in San Francisco to be Appointed by Wiedemann; U.S. Expresses Displeasure)

(Washington) The U.S. side was quite displeased to hear that Captain Wiedemann, a confidant of German Chancellor Hitler, had been appointed as Consul General in San Francisco. It is said that Wiedemann served as a company commander in the European War, and Chancellor Hitler was his former subordinate, and their relationship was very close. Recently, he has been repeatedly ordered by Chancellor Hitler to carry out various secret missions. Therefore, these kinds of things are probably not sympathized with by the American people. It is even rumored that Captain Wiedemann will succeed Dieckhoff as the ambassador to the United States, which is truly surprising. Captain Wiedemann's name was mentioned in the New York State Court's recent trial of a German National Socialist Party spy case, which shows that his behavior is not without suspicion. Compared with Ambassador Dieckhoff, who is a professional diplomat and whose personality is sympathized with by the American side, it is impossible to speak of them in the same breath. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

### U.S. and France Establish Temporary Agreement to Open Regular Air Service

(Paris) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a press release stating that the United States and France have reached a temporary agreement to open a regular transatlantic air route between New York and Marseille, with the Portuguese Azores as a landing station in the middle. The first flight is scheduled for March 15th of this year, taking 20 to 24 hours for the entire journey. Both sides will also conduct negotiations in the near future to establish a long-term formal agreement to replace the current temporary agreement. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

(Washington) Regarding the temporary agreement between Britain and France to open a regular transatlantic air service, political figures here recently commented that the French government's measures are quite satisfactory. By the spring of this year, this air route can be opened to carry passengers, goods, and mail. However, it has not been determined whether it will be operated by one American airline or by several. Among them, Pan American Airways and American Export Airlines reached an agreement in October of last year to divide the business scope of the North Atlantic air route (i.e., Northern Europe and the Scandinavian Peninsula are assigned to Pan American Airways, and the Mediterranean coastal countries and North Africa, as well as West Asia up to the Persian Gulf, are assigned to American Export Airlines). Now, according to the temporary agreement between the United States and France, the two companies will probably jointly operate it. It is reported that the round-trip flights will be no less than four times a week. Political figures here also said regarding this matter that now that the United States and the democratic countries of Europe have completed their air transportation lines, the significance of this air route will certainly be seen as significant if conflicts occur in Europe in the future. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)

### French Government Appoints New Far East Fleet Commander

(Paris) The government recently issued an order stating that Rear Admiral Theogge, Senior Staff Officer of the Naval Staff, has been promoted to Vice Admiral and appointed as Commander of the Far East Fleet. Rear Admiral Daireaux has been appointed as Commander of the Vietnam Fleet. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

### U.S. Naval and Air Force Maneuvers in the Atlantic; Beginning at the End of this Month for Two Months; Testing the Strength of Defending the New Continent

Havas News Agency (Washington Aviation Correspondence) The ink of the "Lima Declaration" signed at the Eighth Pan-American Conference was not yet dry, and the U.S. fleet had already sailed to the Caribbean Sea to conduct large-scale exercises, in order to give the new doctrine of "American Continental Solidarity" a significant meaning. These naval exercises will begin at the end of this month and end in mid-March. The main force of the U.S. Navy, including 140 warships of all classes, 500 aircraft, and 53,000 officers and men, under the command of Admiral Bloch, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, will participate in the event. The exercise area extends from Norfolk, Virginia, to the coast of Brazil in South America, covering an area of 4,000,000 square miles, including the West Indies and various strategic locations in the mid-Atlantic. Among them, the Panama Canal Zone is of particular importance. According to the planned program, the exercise fleet is divided into black and white teams. The white fleet, as the attacking side, commanded by Rear Admiral Giffen, attempts to approach the southeastern coast of the United States or the West Indies and gain a foothold, in order to attack the Panama Canal. The black fleet, as the defending side, commanded by Rear Admiral Dortch, has the task of preventing the attacking side from landing. The procedure for this exercise was announced by the authorities before the signing of the "Lima Declaration," because the Panama Canal is the key to the U.S. Navy and is related to the defense of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Central American countries, whether they agree with it or not, must in fact be included in the scope of the continental defense plan.

In order to participate in the exercises, the Pacific Fleet departed from San Diego and San Pedro, California, at the beginning of this month, sailed through the Panama Canal, and headed for the Caribbean Sea. U.S. naval policy has always been based on maintaining a "Great Ocean Fleet" to take into account the defense of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Therefore, the speed at which this fleet sails through the Panama Canal is a key factor in determining victory or defeat in future foreign operations. This is the reason why this exercise places special emphasis on the canal zone.

Moreover, the location of this year's naval exercises, the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea, was not chosen by chance. It is safe to say that it is related to the evolution of the European situation. In the past few years, the U.S. Navy has mostly conducted exercises in the Pacific, from the Aleutian Islands in the north to the islands in the central Pacific in the west and the west coast of the United States in the east. Its hypothetical target was obviously Japan. This year, it suddenly changed to conducting exercises in the Atlantic, which does not mean that the threat from Japan has diminished, but rather that the situation in the Atlantic has changed. Because the Axis powers are actively expanding their naval, air, and land forces, and they are trying to occupy a stronger position in the markets of Latin American countries, the importance of the Atlantic issue has become equal to the Pacific issue, which contains the crisis of war.

The U.S. government is well aware of these external threats and has decided to issue representations in various ways to warn the Axis powers: diplomatically, to promote the "Lima Declaration"; economically and financially, to decide to assist the Latin American countries; politically, to deal with Germany in extremely harsh terms, such as recalling the ambassador to Germany because of Germany's anti-Semitic movement; and militarily, to hold this large-scale exercise to promote American continental solidarity. Judging from this, this year's U.S. naval exercises can be regarded as an expression of dealing with attacks from the East.

According to repeated official statements, this exercise is only to implement a plan that the naval authorities have long planned and has nothing to do with foreign affairs. However, according to the government's national defense plan submitted to Congress, Atlantic defense must be strengthened to an unprecedented level, and air force strength must be increased to a level that fears no provocation. This large-scale exercise shows that the United States intends to prepare to extend its powerful power in a decisive way in the current international disputes.

### Germany Develops Foreign Trade with Central and Eastern Europe and South America; Barter Policy Expected to be Implemented; Competition from Britain and the United States is Inevitable

(London) The recent comments from business circles here on the fact that German Economics Minister Funk has taken over Dr. Schacht's concurrent post as President of the Central Bank are that competition between Britain and Germany in trade with Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and South America will intensify. Because Funk has always strived to promote the policy of barter trade, what he will seek to advance in the future will probably be nothing more than two things: (1) The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have mostly become German vassals, and Funk will promote trade with these countries based on the barter trade policy; (2) To promote business relations with the countries of South America and increase German influence, while excluding British and American goods from the South American market, starting from this policy. If so, Britain will naturally have to abandon its plan to improve trade relations with Germany. For example, the Federation of British Industries originally planned to negotiate with the German Industry Association to discuss the distribution of markets everywhere, and Commerce Secretary Stanley once said that the cabinet would "morally endorse" this issue. However, since the current situation is special, the only thing to do is to advise the Federation of British Industries to abandon the negotiation proposal. It is not safe to only do that, and the British government should also rely on the Export Credits Guarantee Department Expansion Act to vigorously increase export credit lending, so that British exporters can compete with German businessmen in foreign markets. Such responses are all within expectations. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)

### Mussolini Delivers Speech; Ridicules Anti-Fascists

(Rome) Premier Mussolini recently gave a speech to thousands of farmers at the Argentina Theater here, repeatedly referring to the tense situation between France and Italy in sarcastic terms. He said, "If France is stubborn, then Italy can be even more stubborn." He also said, "I said in September of last year that our country's enemies were too stupid to be a cause for concern. To this day, I still believe that this statement is not false." He also said, "If I were to repeat to you the abuse of fascism by a certain country's newspapers, you would all laugh heartily, and the laughter would shatter all the glass windows in the capital city beyond the Alps." He also said, "The anti-fascist attitude of foreign countries is incorrigible and not worth worrying about, but they are completely ignorant of the entire Italian problem, and their stupidity is incomparable." He continued with such remarks, which were endless. In conclusion, he unreservedly promoted Italy's current agricultural policy. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)

### Someone Plots to Assassinate Chamberlain

(London) According to yesterday evening's newspapers, the police department received a communication stating that someone was plotting to assassinate Chamberlain's life. Therefore, there are armed police officers to protect him in all the places he visits. Manchester police discovered a large amount of explosives yesterday and arrested one person. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

### Stimson Writes to Hull to Rescind Arms Embargo on Spain

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull recently stated that he has received a letter from former Secretary of State Stimson requesting that the order to embargo arms to Spain be rescinded. Stimson is currently on Long Island and recently gave an interview to Havas News Agency here by telephone, stating that he has long believed that Spain is a battlefield between dictatorship and democracy, and most American celebrities have urged him to come forward to uphold justice for the Spanish Republican government. However, due to his ill health, he has not been able to do so. He has recently written to Secretary of State Hull, asking him to rescind the arms embargo. Stimson recently joined prominent figures from all walks of life in the United States to form the "Do Not Help Japan's Aggression" Committee. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

(Washington) Regarding the matter of rescinding the order prohibiting the transportation of arms to Spain, a reliable source stated that Stimson also stated that the current policy of the U.S. government has disadvantaged the Spanish Republican government and needs to be corrected urgently. According to American law, President Roosevelt originally had the power to rescind this embargo without seeking the consent of Congress, so he requested that the Secretary of State convey this intention to the President.

### Lin Bosheng Attacked in Hong Kong, Slightly Injured, Not Life-Threatening

Hong Kong Correspondence. After Shanghai China Daily manager Lin Bosheng left Shanghai for Hong Kong, he immediately became the manager of the South China Daily and the behind-the-scenes host of the Weilan Bookstore. He also represented Wang Jingwei in contacting various parties, making him quite busy. Lin usually traveled between the Weilan Bookstore on the seventh floor of the Queen's Road Central building and the South China Daily, often entering and leaving major hotels and inns with relevant figures, engaging in activities. Since Lin and Mei Shiping jointly published a telegram in Wang Jingwei's name seeking peace, the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong were angered by Wang's traitorous pursuit of peace and thus viewed Lin as a traitor. However, Lin Bosheng was unaware of the need to restrain himself, writing articles in the South China Daily every day attacking the authorities and promoting the traitorous theory of seeking peace through humiliation. Therefore, he was attacked on the afternoon of the 17th. At around 2 PM that afternoon, Lin went from his residence to the Lincoln's Cafeteria on Des Voeux Road to have afternoon tea with a friend. At 5:10 PM, after finishing tea, he stepped out of the restaurant. Just as he crossed the exceptionally busy road and walked to the veranda in front of Watson's Pharmacy on the opposite side, several young men dressed as workers suddenly appeared to Lin's left and right. One of them immediately pulled out an iron file and struck Lin's head violently. Lin, because he was wearing a felt hat, was not seriously injured and immediately ran forward while shouting loudly. However, the attackers continued to pursue him relentlessly. Another person struck Lin's head again with an iron rod, and the one holding the iron file also forcefully slashed at Lin's neck. Lin, suffering from these blows, collapsed to the ground, with blood streaming down from his neck and head. At this time, Chinese and Western pedestrians on the road gathered to watch, and some frantically blew police whistles. However, the assailants calmly continued to violently beat Lin several more times. Because two Westerners stepped forward to apprehend them, they scattered and fled. One of them, unable to escape in time, was captured by an approaching British soldier. At this point, the police also dispatched a car to the scene to apprehend the perpetrators and summoned an ambulance by phone to take Lin to Maryknoll Hospital. The captured suspect was taken back to the police station.

After Lin was sent to the hospital, doctors cleaned the wounds, and he gradually regained consciousness. An X-ray examination revealed that Lin suffered injuries to his head, neck, arms, and other parts, and there was a small fracture in his skull. His eyes were also injured, but because the injuries were not to vital areas, his life was not in danger. According to doctors, he will be able to be discharged from the hospital in three weeks.

The Hong Kong authorities, before the truth of the case is clear, do not want to disclose the details to the public but have offered a reward of two hundred and fifty dollars to strictly apprehend the perpetrators. As for the suspect Chen, who was arrested, it is said that he is twenty-two years old and works as a painter. He strongly denies the attack on Lin. The police authorities, for the sake of prudence, have temporarily detained Chen for further investigation and plan to have Lin personally identify him after he recovers and is discharged from the hospital. Lin is thirty-three years old, of medium build, wears Western suits and carries a cane, and his clothing is quite luxurious. He once studied in Paris. When Wang Jingwei arrived in Paris, Lin contacted students studying in France to hold a welcome meeting, thus developing a relationship with Wang and later becoming a second-rate celebrity within Wang's faction.

### Xinghua Telephone Poles and Wires Destroyed by Ice, Communication Severed for Several Days

Xinghua Correspondence. Since water flowed down from the west of this county, it has been a vast ocean, and the accumulated water has not receded to this day. The day before, the weather turned bitterly cold, and the river formed an ice floe. On the night of the 8th, it was swayed by a gentle breeze, destroying the telegraph and telephone poles and wires on various routes within the county, completely stopping communication. Local agencies and people felt inconvenienced in communicating with each other, and what was most worrying was that there might be accidents that could not be known. The Telegraph and Telephone Bureau, therefore, considered the matter of great importance and immediately ordered its employees to go to various routes to investigate and retrieve [the damaged equipment]. According to the investigation, the telegraph lines (from Xinghua to Gaoyou) were about 80% damaged. The Xingyan line (Xinghua to Yancheng) was 40% damaged. The Xing Sha line (Xinghua to Shagou, Yancheng) was 50% damaged. The Xingding line (Xinghua to Dingxi, Dongtai), although damaged, could still be repaired. The wooden poles and lines on the remaining routes were missing, and it was necessary to replace them. It would be difficult to restore them in a short time. The bureau has already sent personnel to various routes to retrieve and gather [the damaged equipment] and has submitted a request to the county government to order the township chiefs and military and police agencies stationed in the townships to assist in the matter and reported to the Construction Department for instructions.

### Japanese Troops in Rugao Invade Shili墩, Repelled by Chinese Troops

Rugao Correspondence. After suffering heavy losses in the battle of Kongjiaqiao, the Japanese troops in Rugao have been actively stepping up training in an attempt to retaliate. At about 6 AM on the 7th of this month, more than 300 Japanese and puppet troops, carrying two steel cannons and light machine guns, invaded the Shili墩 position of the Chinese troops in two routes. One route of a hundred people attacked the front along the north bank of the Xiaoxi River. The second route of more than two hundred people detoured from the south of the Xiaoxi River to the rear of the Chinese troops, planning to cross the river at Shili墩 and join the first route to attack, attempting to occupy Jiali Town in one fell swoop. The Chinese troops destroyed the orange beam area around Shili墩 and used fierce firepower to prevent the Japanese troops from crossing the river. They also organized their forces and advanced to meet the Japanese troops on the front, relying on strong fortifications to launch attacks from all sides. The Japanese troops were unable to resist and retreated. The Chinese troops chased to Wuli墩 and then returned. In this battle, it is estimated that one hundred Japanese troops were killed.

### Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government Organizes Puppet Road Protection Association, Obeying the Japanese Army's Intentions

Suzhou Correspondence. The puppet provincial government recently received an order from the Japanese army to actively organize a puppet road protection association, soliciting people from all walks of life to join. The guerrillas on the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line are extremely active, often demolishing bridges and roads. The Japanese army used high-pressure tactics, ordering the puppet provincial government to plan protection. It is reported that the puppet association is ready to be established, and the founding meeting will be held soon. There are very few Japanese troops stationed in the urban and rural areas of Wuxian County. Bunkers have been installed at each gate to prevent guerrilla attacks. Because the guerrillas are active in the western suburbs, the Japanese troops are extremely vigilant. Because the Japanese troops often harass various places in the county, Zhuang Ding teams have been formed one after another to defend the locality.

### Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou Landlords' Rent Collection Problems, Guerilla Activities' Restraint, Japanese and Puppet Economies Affected

Suzhou Correspondence. According to the usual peacetime custom, rural households collect rent from tenant farmers, and it must be completed every year by the winter solstice festival. The current situation is particularly special, and the issue of rent collection is far from easy. I still remember the land rent two years ago, compared to the three counties of Suzhou, Changshu, and Wuxi, Suzhou was the best, and Changshu was second. This year is very different. Here is an overview of the rent collection situation in the three counties.

Changshu's land rent is best in the east of the county. The southwest of the county is less good because it is close to the Nanbei Bridge area of ​​Wuxian County. The collection method is mostly that the majority of landlords automatically set up cooperative collection in the countryside, called a certain rent collection station. Each landlord recommends a director to handle rent collection affairs. They do not accept any orders or have any organization. The discounted price is set at six yuan per stone of rice. The calculation and promotion are also very smooth. By the end of the lunar year, various rent collection stations had collected more than 100,000 yuan in cash.

Wuxi's land rent has recently been collected best in the southeast of the county. The collection method is still that landlords collect as usual. Each district has a rent collection office. The discounted price is seven yuan and one jiao per stone of rice, including wheat rent. Tenant farmers and landlords who are usually friendly still take the initiative to weave rents as usual. By the end of the year, the county had collected about 150,000 yuan.

Suzhou's land rent is collected by a puppet "Rent and Tax Collection Bureau" jointly established by the puppet side and shameless landlords. The puppet branch has fourteen offices, but in fact, only the offices in Mudu and Hengjing have collected more than 30,000 yuan. The most affected was Li Chaoyuan, the puppet district chief of Nanbei Bridge, who was shot and killed by guerrillas. The puppet officials of various puppet branches were afraid to go, and Zhou Huaixuan, the puppet branch chief of Nanbei Bridge, saw that the situation was not good and resigned immediately, leaving only a stoker to take care of the empty house. Even if tenant farmers went to the bureau to pay rent, no one dared to accept it. Therefore, it is said that the rent tax will be collected uniformly on December 1st last year, which is all a deception. On January 10th of this year, Yun Quanwang became the puppet chief of the Nanbei Bridge puppet branch. He wanted to urgently collect rent, exploit the peasants, please the puppet side, and was afraid that guerrillas would attack, sending them to their deaths in vain, so he just made a show. The puppet side has no concrete plan for this thorny issue, and they wanted to ask the Japanese side to send Japanese and puppet troops to the countryside for protection. In fact, the rural areas are vast, and it is difficult to station troops in each village one by one, so there is no specific way to collect rent in Suzhou, and the economic income of the Japanese puppets has been seriously affected.

### Japanese Army Suffering Heavy Losses in Various Places, Wounded Soldiers Arriving in Shanghai in a Steady Stream, Zhongshan Hospital Receiving 200 Patients Daily, Healed Soldiers Must Leave to Return to Their Units

The mainland newspaper reports that according to reliable sources, two hundred wounded Japanese soldiers are transported daily from Hongkou to the Nanjing Zhongshan Hospital across from Qiqi Road. Trucks full of wounded soldiers pass through the Bund of the two concessions and enter Nanjing. Whether these wounded soldiers were injured by guerrillas in the port area or transported from the Japanese army hospital in Hongkou is not certain. Japanese wounded soldiers began to be transported to Nanjing more than a week ago and continue to be transported constantly.

A Large Batch of Wounded Soldiers Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

Yesterday morning, from the Yangshupu area, the Japanese Red Cross ship Yoshino Maru arrived with a batch of wounded soldiers from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. After arriving at the port, five large trucks prepared by the Japanese side, all covered with white Red Cross cloth awnings, were used by those resembling engineers to carry the soldiers from the ship onto the trucks on canvas beds. The soldiers were transported in batches to the field hospital set up by the Japanese in eastern Shanghai for treatment. From morning to noon, the trucks shuttled back and forth. The transportation was completed at around 2 PM. All the corpses and ashes of Japanese soldiers who had died in various hospitals in the port area were loaded onto large trucks and collapsed trucks at around 3 PM yesterday afternoon and transported to the pier to be loaded onto the water disease ship converted from the Osaka merchant ship and transported back to Japan.

Healed Soldiers Must Fight Again

The Japanese Shanghai Garrison Headquarters recently noted that the number of wounded soldiers being treated in the rear wounded soldier hospitals and field hospitals set up in the Pudong, Puxi, and Nanshi areas is quite large, and that many of the wounded soldiers have recovered. As the front-line war is in full swing and there is an urgent need for reinforcements, more than 20 members of the Matsui慰問团 were dispatched in military vehicles in batches over the past two days to the Shanghai Hospital on Meizhou Road in Yangshupu, the Zhongshan Hospital in front of the Maple Bridge, and the temporary wounded soldier hospitals set up in Hongqiao Wujiagang. The rear hospitals and field hospitals are resolutely comforting the soldiers and clarifying the number of wounded soldiers who have been healed in order to depart regularly to return to their units and augment the military force.

### Japan Expanding Police Power in Hongkou District, More Than 60 Japanese Police Officers Transferred from Domestic Japan, Five More Police Sub-Stations Established in Hongkou

The negotiations on the opening of Hongkou have been delayed for more than a year because the Japanese side has no sincerity in returning police powers, so there is still no hope of a resolution. It is learned that the Japanese side has recently expanded the powers of Japanese police in the northeast districts of Hongkou. In addition to significantly increasing the number of Japanese consular police officers, one branch has been added to Yangshupu Road, Wusong Road, North Sichuan Road, Shigaota Road, and Dixiwei Road. More than 60 police officers have been transferred from Japan to take charge of their affairs. This move clearly has the suspicion of replacing the patrol room in exercising police powers. The concession authorities are paying attention to it.

### Street Refugees Eager for Shelter, Letters of Appeal Sent to This Newspaper

Since the war, displaced compatriots from various places have come to Shanghai one after another. Due to difficult living conditions, more than 50,000 people have been sheltered in the two concessions. Although the Relief Association has raised funds in many ways, winter is approaching, and there is a need for funds for supplies and winter clothing. It is now learned that the refugee camp being built on Dunxin Road covers an area of ​​more than ten mu and has schools, bath rooms, and medical facilities, which can accommodate about 9,000 people. People are being moved in one after another.

Living in the Open Air, Words Cannot Express Their Hardship

However, in addition to the refugees who have been sheltered, there are still many refugees on the streets. Most of these people came to Shanghai because their hometowns were unsafe and their homes were destroyed, and they had no means of earning a living. The shelter has not been able to accommodate as many as possible, resulting in people having to live in the open air in the bustling market. The citizens of Shanghai should provide assistance to prevent them from freezing and starving. This newspaper received a letter yesterday from a named street refugee, with sincerity and earnest words. Here is the original letter: "To the Editor of Shen Bao, I am writing respectfully. We refugees are from a fallen hometown, our homes are destroyed, our population is scattered, and no fewer than hundreds of thousands of people have come to Shanghai to take refuge. All rely on refugee shelters to nurture them, and there are still countless people who have not been sheltered. Living in the open air is unbearably difficult. Benevolence and universal relief are still ailments of Yao and Shun, but your gentlemen have a compassionate heart. May I have this letter published in the newspaper for publicity, or may I ask your newspaper to send a letter to the refugee shelter to shelter and relieve all the street refugees. A thought of benevolence will extend to the scales and armor. If we do not treat them with contempt or pity, then a drop of Yangzhi nectar is no different from releasing life in the lotus pond. Planting virtue is boundless, and the rewards are also infinite."

Order Disrupted in the Fallen Area

After the fall of the mainland, order has disappeared. This newspaper yesterday received a letter from Tang Naiwo, who recently came to Shanghai from Danyang to take refuge. The situation there is unspeakable. Land property rights have been seized, etc. This phenomenon is not unique to Danyang. It has become commonplace in various places along the two lines. There are many painful histories, and it is enough to see that the fallen area is already unbearable for the people today.

### More Than 100 Groups Held a Wang Yiting Memorial Service Yesterday, The Assembly Officially Decided to Confer the Title of Duke Qinda to Wang, and Organized a Permanent Memorial Research Committee

The Zhenji Committee, the Central Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee, and more than 100 other organizations in the city held a Wang Yiting memorial service at the Huzhou Guild Hall on Guizhou Road at 2 PM yesterday. All charitable organizations flew flags at half-mast yesterday to express their grief. The Assembly officially decided to confer the title of Duke "Qinda" to Wang and organized a permanent memorial research committee to develop a long-term memorial plan. The details are recorded as follows.

A Glimpse of the Venue

The Assembly venue was set up in the Chen Yingzhi Memorial Hall of the Huzhou Guild Hall. The Wang family's memorial hall was located in the center of the north end. Wang's portrait was placed in the middle, with the party and national flags hanging on the upper corners. In front of the stage, a large archway of plain silk was erected, topped with the eight characters "Two Generations of Perfect People" and "Admirable Example." On both sides of the archway were elegiac couplets sent by Chairman Jiang and Kong Xiangxi. From the gate along the aisle to the surroundings of the venue, elegiac couplets and banners from various central ministries, committees, and circles were hung everywhere, making it extremely solemn and respectful. Yesterday, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial service, including Yan Huiqing, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Li Guiyong, Lin Kanghou, Xu Xiaochu, Pan Xulun, Li Wenjie, and representatives from 115 organizations, including the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. The scene was unprecedented.

Details of the Memorial Service

The memorial service began at 2 PM yesterday. First, the orchestra of the Shanghai Orphanage and the Puyi Training Institute played mourning music. Wen Lanzi delivered the opening speech, followed by the memorial ceremony. Everyone stood in silence, Shi Shengzhi burned incense, Chu Qiaqing offered flowers, Wang Tongsun, Zhu Xieshen, and Lu Jiesun read the memorial text, and then Fan and Mingde, the two girls' schools, sang a memorial song. Zhao Jinqing reported on Wang's life story, and Ye Bo, Guan Jiongzhi, and Lin Kanghou delivered eulogies one after another. The Fengshi ceremony was then held. The Shanghai Orphanage sang a memorial plan again. Finally, Wang's sons, Mengnan, Shuxian, Jimei, and his son-in-law, Lu Chuanlin, delivered thank-you speeches.

Bestowing the Title of Qinda

When Lin Kanghou delivered his eulogy, he said that although Mr. Yiting had already been titled "Minghui" by various groups in the Huzhou region, this was a local title. Today, the Zhenji Committee, the Central Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee, and other organizations in the city are holding a grand memorial service here, and another title should be bestowed to show solemnity. After the meeting agreed, the presidium was asked to discuss and determine the title "Qinda." After unanimous adoption by the meeting, the Fengshi ceremony was held. Everyone stood in silence, the chairman respectfully held the position of "Mr. Qinda" for worship, played music, burned incense, offered flowers, read blessings, bowed three times, "Mr. Qinda"'s family thanked them, and finally the chairman group pushed Zhang Jusheng to respectfully hold the position of "Mr. Qinda" and gave it to the family to take back for worship. The ceremony was completed.

Long-Term Commemoration

The conference decided that Mr. Wang Yiting's life career has been meritorious to society and the country and that there must be a permanent memorial plan to pass on for a long time. It was decided to organize a permanent memorial research committee and first appoint Wen Lanting, Chu Qiaqing, Shi Shengzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Guan Jiongzhi, Qin Yanqi, Zhang Jusheng, Zhu Xieshen, Yuan Ludeng, Zhu Yinjiang, Liu Hanyi, Pang Laichen, Gao Hanqing, Wu Dongmai, Xie Jiaqian, Xu Caichen, Yuan Ying Master, Zhang Lanping, and Xu Qianlin as members. The list of members will be increased later.

Assembly Memorial Text

On January 22nd, the 28th year of the Republic of China, representatives of various participating organizations, Yan Huiqing, Shi Zhaoji, Ye Erkai, Shen Wei, Zhang Yuanji, Shi Zhaozeng, Qin Xitian, Yu Hede, Wen Lanting, Liu Hanyi, Huang Qinglan, Lin Zujin, Guan Jiongzhi, Zhao Xi'en, etc., respectfully present incense and flowers to the spirit of Wang Yiting Jushi, saying, "Alas, the Benevolent One established religion, the beginning of all good, exhausting the body without hesitation, and treating enemies and relatives equally. Merit and virtue can save fire, and Paramita must come first. Transforming karma into wonderful trees and ascending to the shore of the Tao is Nirvana. In the past, the ancestors who inherited the teachings of the Benevolent One were mostly like this. Today, I, the great lay Buddhist Yiting, have been gifted with wisdom since childhood, widely practiced benevolence, had sincere inner behavior, and solemn external appearance. In Buddhism, he was able to transcend the expression of words and take the protection of all living beings as his heart. Observing his management of himself, the love, hate, jealousy, and clinging pursuit of worldly affairs were swept away. And when he treats others, he encourages personal virtue, is careful in official duties, and works tirelessly forgetting sleep, food, cold, and heat. Whoever has even a bit of benefit to others must do his best, without favoring or avoiding based on one's own gains and losses. He is truly one who unties the karma and spreads the great vow. Even the remaining art of calligraphy and painting is magnificent and brilliant. One paper is circulated, and everyone fights for the wise and noble. The small deeds that are in people's eyes and ears cannot be exhausted by paper and ink. Today, colleagues set up a meeting to commemorate and mourn, and its words are, "Taking benevolence as one's responsibility, continuing until death, the source of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism is inherently the same. Duke dwells in the market, deeply in tune with Buddhist principles, many generations of nurturing, Bodhi seeds, lotus heart pure and clean, not muddy, Turbid calamities are entangled, not worrying about mundane ties, saving disasters and difficulties, with a broad coat covered, far and near are the same, praise and sound compete. From Duke's point of view, we just do our best. The emptiness is serene, without worry or joy. The environment does not change the heart, and the heart has nothing to rely on. Heaven and earth are thatched huts, and all things are one finger. Returning from the sea, arriving safely, pure vows, thorough source of law, letting go and returning to the west, liberating the complex commission, the great view of a wise man, originally without birth or death, both monks and laity are sad, the capital is shocked and far and near, those who come later will deeply admire, Shangxiang."

Cilian Memorial Text

The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Council Memorial Text states, "On January 22nd, the 28th year of the Republic of China, Huang Qinglan of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Council and representatives of various member organizations respectfully offer mountain delicacies and field wine to the spirit of Mr. Wang Yiting, saying, "Fan Da Ting is a masterpiece, as early as the mountains and rivers showed strangeness, pregnant with spirituality in Zhoupu, hunting for classics and history in the sea, learning new knowledge and retranslating, following Tao Yi's pursuit of the times, both accumulating and being able to disperse, grieving the wind and trees and giving generously, issuing the grand vow of compassion, still being drowned by one's own, Luhu Songbin's charity groups are scattered and divergent. If you want to restore their careers, you should have uniform steps, admire the spirit of unity, and then start to establish, only the south needle is regarded as the view, rely on the leadership of today, sigh the fire of heaven, alas, the full payment of sores and injuries, ten thousand rooms expand its wide mansion, hundreds of millions of surnames shelter its displacement, float in the South China Sea to assist in vibration, please issue Tang from the treasury, also avoid the land to show ambition, solid sound and name are transmitted, keep the purity and be pure, close to the bustle but not dyed, send the rest of the interest of the painting, combine the three excellences in the book poem, already silently repair the pure profession, climb the old age and why doubt, why is this disease suffered, just returned and reported sorrow, suddenly fierce asking, like the collapse of the five internal organs, the fathers and elders feel and fall in tears, the lanes hear and mourn, sad wind emblem its cloud passing, faint crane reins without return, look at the spike account in the famous garden, still the model is here, my party's old age is lost, Shenzhou has not washed away the fire, bestow a large recruitment on tonight, soul come and drink the fortress, alas, Shangxiang."

Yan and Gauss left Shanghai early on Wednesday (18th) last week and are expected to return to Shanghai tomorrow afternoon (23rd, today).

### Yong Wheel Restricts Passenger Ticket Water Foot Case Yu Qiaqing Telegraphically States Opinions Post-War Water Foot Increases All Wheels Obtain Surplus Facilitating Local Product Sales Should Sell at Forty Percent Discount

Regarding the Shanghai-Ningbo money transport, due to post-war passenger ticket water foot, continuously increasing, adding to the burden of the Zhejiang Eastern people, affecting local product sales, therefore the Ning County Party, Government, Military, Police, and Judicial Joint Meeting's 126th resolution decided to restrict it and instructed all transport companies to comply. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a leading figure in the shipping industry of this city and the General Manager of the Chinese-Italian Company, yesterday telegraphed Ningbo, detailing his opinions. The original text states: "Chairman Chen of Ningbo County, Director Yu, and Chairman Zhou of the Chamber of Commerce, may your guidance be acknowledged. I have read Ningbo Shipping Association's Directive No. 278, issued by the Joint Meeting upon the request of the Chamber of Commerce to

Restrict Ship Ticket Water Foot

After the 126th resolution's deliberation, the recent water foot prices should be calculated at a 70% discount, with cabin ticket prices limited to one yuan and five jiao for the steerage, four yuan for the cabin, and six yuan for the first-class cabin. Tips for the tea attendant should be given at the passenger's discretion and not forced. We order all ships to comply, etc., demonstrating a sincere intention to be considerate and protective. Our company is pleased to hear this and will naturally comply. However, regarding the steerage ticket price and the freight discount, there are still points that require attention and explanation, which must be reiterated. The two yuan Shanghai-Ningbo steerage ticket price set by our company last year

Includes Tea Attendant's Wine Expenses

Previously, extortion was absolutely prohibited. Now, the small account is to be given at the passenger's discretion. At the beginning of this re-emphasized policy, it may be possible to comply for a while. However, the tea attendants' accumulated habits are ingrained, and with a slight slackening, they will easily seize the opportunity to use their old tricks. In the near future, I fear that the abuses of wine expenses equaling or exceeding the ticket price will occur. I urge you to pay special attention. As for the freight prices, they have been increased several times since August 13th. For example, in May of last year, Taikoo, Ning Shao, and our company, recognizing the soaring coal prices, jointly discussed and set new water foot prices to compensate for the losses. Our company and Taikoo have continued to comply until now.

Shanghai-Ningbo Prohibits Direct Navigation

Various ships, under the pretext of detouring through Wenzhou and Taiwan, have doubled the previously set water foot prices, causing suffering to cargo and passengers. Witnessing this situation, our company has consistently maintained the original prices of the three companies, unwilling to increase them and avoid adding to the burden of passengers. Now that the Chamber of Commerce has approved the restriction of water foot prices, the authorities are being considerate of the merchants' difficulties, and the Chamber of Commerce is protecting its members. The intention is admirable. However, calculating freight at a 70% discount seems that cargo and passengers are still not receiving the actual benefit. Therefore, our company telegraphed Commander Guo a few days ago, advocating that, except for cotton, bulk goods such as silk, cocoons, tea leaves, paper, tin foil, etc.

Should Be Actually Charged at Forty Percent Discount

Because bulk goods are exclusively transported by the Fuhua Company, the Agricultural Foundation Bureau, and various cargo sales offices. The former two receive funding allocated by the government, and the latter receives subsidies from various industries to cover expenses. There is no need to collect commissions. If it is other goods, then generally charge a 50% discount, and give the customs broker an 8.5% commission to show preferential treatment. Once Shanghai-Ningbo direct navigation is restored, coal costs and sailing time can be saved relatively, and further reductions can be considered to facilitate the smooth transportation of local products. Moreover, what is currently exported from Ningbo is not entirely the local products of our Eastern Zhejiang. Anhui Southern Jiangxi and Hunan provinces

Transfer Through Oujiang and Ningbo for Export

The number is particularly considerable. Famous ships, during this peak season for local products, will definitely be able to thrive in business by reducing water foot prices. Observing the Kai Bo leased by Ning Shao and the Ende leased by Sanbei, even if calculated at half the water foot price, they can still have a surplus of tens of thousands of yuan each month, one can imagine the prosperity of the business and the need to reduce water foot prices. Hede has been engaged in the shipping industry for several decades, and has always held the dual goals of promoting the transportation of local products and alleviating rural poverty. This reduction in water foot prices is indeed the intention of our government to maintain the countryside. However, whether it is based on the prices set in May of last year and given a 70% discount, or based on the current water foot prices of detouring through Wenzhou and Taiwan and then discounted, is a matter of great importance, with huge differences. Because calculating at a 70% discount based on the prices in May of last year is not much different. If charging a 70% discount based on the water foot prices of detouring through Wenzhou and Taiwan, cargo and passengers will still not be able to benefit. I urge you to give detailed instructions and reply, I eagerly await. Yu Hede kowtows."

### Pudong False Alarm Electricity Interruption Entire Darkness Japanese Puppet Mourn Fear Disturbance All Night

Since a large number of Chinese troops attacked the Japanese base in the Pudong Yanpu area on the morning of the 20th, the situation has been tense, and the residents are like frightened birds. Unexpectedly, a false alarm occurred again on the evening of the 21st. At 6:00 PM that evening, the electricity supplied by the Pudong Power Plant, which was occupied by the Japanese, was suddenly interrupted, and the streetlights in Dongchang Road and other places were completely extinguished, plunging into a world of darkness. The stores suspected that the guerrillas had attacked again and closed their doors one after another. The residents looked at each other in dismay. Japanese troops and puppet police were dispatched everywhere and the ferry crossings were closed early. For a time, the streets were deserted, like a dead land. Occasionally, the sound of galloping iron hooves could be heard, which was the Japanese army passing by. In addition, only the sound of dogs barking in the distance and sporadic gunshots could be heard, which were obviously Japanese troops making a show of force due to nervousness. However, the Japanese side had difficulty finding out where the wires were broken and why they were interrupted for a while, so the lights were not restored all night. The Japanese puppets were disturbed all night and could not find peace.

### Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Rewards Overseas Chinese Investment Special Investment Guidance Office Established

In view of the urgent need to develop the southwestern provinces, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has specially established an Overseas Chinese Investment Guidance Office to facilitate overseas Chinese investment. Branch offices have also been established in the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureaus of Fujian, Guangdong, and other provinces. If overseas Chinese return to China to invest and are not very clear about the situation in the mainland, the commission will send personnel to provide guidance. It is reported that overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have gathered 50 million yuan and are preparing to invest in the country to develop resources. Overseas Chinese leader Hu Wenhu has already arrived in Hong Kong from Singapore to discuss development matters with various provinces.

### Guerrillas on the Shanghai-Wuxi Road Fierce Battle with Japanese Troops Encirclement and Annihilation for Five Hours Two Hand-to-Hand Combats Two Company Commanders Heroically Martyred

According to reliable Chinese sources arriving in Shanghai from Changshu, on the morning of the 19th of this month, the Japanese troops in Xintang Township between Taicang and Changshu along the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway were again surrounded and attacked by guerrillas. The guerrillas, led by Wang Koukou Regiment Commander of the 12th Brigade under the command of Commander Xiong of the Six County Guerrillas, engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese troops for five hours. The guerrillas engaged in hand-to-hand combat twice and broke into the Japanese defense zone, annihilating more than 50 Japanese troops. The guerrillas also suffered considerable losses. Company commanders Li Ligui and others heroically sacrificed themselves in this battle.

### All Patrol Ships of the Jianghai Customs Remain Only Two So Far The Rest Have Been Seized by the Japanese

More than a dozen patrol ships of the Jianghai Customs, including Fuxing, Yunxing, Lianxing, Huguang, Jiaoji, and Fuwei, have not been returned since they were seized by the Japanese in the winter of the year before last. Although the General Taxation Department of the Customs has repeatedly negotiated, the Japanese have always delayed. It has been found that the above-mentioned patrol ships are no longer in the Huangpu River and have long been converted by the Japanese into military transport ships. It is also said that several of them have been severely damaged, and Fuxing is one example. During the Shanghai war, the ship's hull was pierced by artillery fire. Eight speedboats on the ship were also forcibly seized by the Japanese when the National Army had not yet withdrawn from Shanghai, because during the Shanghai war, the Japanese suspected that the Chinese troops who launched torpedoes at the Izumo warship were driving one of these speedboats. As of now, there are only two patrol ships under the jurisdiction of the Customs, Haiguang and Liuxing. Because these two ships are grain transport ships, specializing in supplying grain and fodder to the islands to guard the lighthouses, they were not seized. According to reports from Datong reporters, Luo Demian, Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, recently negotiated with the Japanese to release the seized patrol ships to facilitate customs work, but the Japanese still have no sincerity in returning them.

### Trademark Registration Must Be Certified by Association Tang Heqing's Suggestion

Tang Heqing, manager of the Dahua Shunfeng Brand Thermos Factory in this city, is an executive member of the Thermos Industry Association. Recently, in view of the fact that the patterns and styles of trademarks are often similar among industry peers, and disputes often arise, which not only affects business but also causes disadvantages to both parties, and that this phenomenon is not unique to one industry, but occurs in various industries in Shanghai. In order to protect legitimate commerce and completely eliminate disputes, he wrote to the association to forward a letter to the Industry and Commerce Association to be presented to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stating that henceforth, trademark registrations must be certified in writing by the industry association before they can be examined and approved, because the industry association is a group of the industry and is familiar with the local industry situation, which can avoid imitation and deception. This suggestion is quite insightful, and it is expected that the Ministry of Economic Affairs will definitely adopt it.

### War Zone Chinese Paper Mills Japanese Implementation of Seizure Zeng Tempted Various Factories to Cooperate, Firmly Refused Now Dispatching Workers to Repair Machinery Preparing to Start Work

The paper mills founded by Chinese merchants, opened in Nanshi, Pudong, Zhabei, and other places, total more than ten. Among them, the larger ones include the Dachina Paper Mill in Zhabei Yunzaobang, which occupies more than 30 mu of land, and all the factory buildings and machinery are worth more than one million yuan. The Tianzhang Paper Mill (located in Lujiazui, Pudong) and the Senji Paper Mill (located in Jinji Bridge, Xujiahui) founded by Liu Bosen are worth more than three million yuan. The Jiangnan Paper Mill (located at No. 10 Guangfu Road North, Caojiadu) founded by Wu Yaoting has a total property of more than two million yuan. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war and the westward movement of the National Army, the factories have been suspended one after another because they were in the war zone, and the factories' property has been seized by the Japanese, who tempted the factory owners to cooperate and start work, but the authorities of each factory deeply understood the great righteousness and would rather endure painful sacrifices and firmly refused to cooperate. It is now learned that the Japanese, in order to seize property rights, have come forward to take over through the "Paper Industry Co., Ltd." and have been employing Japanese, Korean, and general ignorant Chinese workers for days to carry out the repair of the machinery of each factory, preparing to start work. The Japanese's illegal acts of encroachment are deeply hated by the Chinese people.

### Public Works Bureau Organizes Committee Considers Staff Treatment Committee Selection Already Announced

The Public Works Bureau Personnel Committee, on December 23rd of last year (Friday), passed the methods for granting the bureau's staff remittance allowances and living expenses allowances. The public has been quite critical of these methods. In view of this, the bureau has decided to invite representatives from the business community to form a committee. The task of the committee is to review the above-mentioned allowance methods and report to the Public Works Bureau. According to the opinion of the committee, whether the established methods are appropriate. If deemed inappropriate, how should they be revised? The elected members are as follows: Mr. R. E.

### Physiological Changes of Newlyweds and Causes of Energy Decline

— Written by Yang Daonan, graduate of the Medical Department of Russian Labor University

How beautiful and joyful it is for young men and women to love each other, with the charming image of their beloved engraved in their hearts and embracing sweet ideals?! If heaven grants their wish and they become a formal couple; the lover in their heart becomes a companion for a lifetime, isn't this new married bliss even more intoxicating?

However, during the period of marriage—becoming a new couple, all kinds of changes will occur both physically and mentally. This change is entirely a physiological phenomenon, a physiological phenomenon that has not been experienced in virginity or boyhood. Although it does not have a great impact on the physical and mental aspects of the new couple, it may sometimes be somewhat harmful.

Among the physical changes, the easiest to notice is the bride's weight gain. What is the reason for this? Originally, as a result of the couple living together, a kind of zymase is produced in the bride's body, which can naturally produce fat and increase the bride's weight. In medicine, this is called seminal cell hematopoiesis, which is the first change for a newlywed woman.

Therefore, newly married couples need to work hard and for a considerable period to enter the "Garden of Love." At the time of the wedding, women do not feel much interest in married life due to fear or overwork, so husbands should guide them in many ways to make them unconsciously accustomed to married life, and that will be good.

To consolidate the "foundation of love," the health of both husband and wife must be ensured. Although the soundness of the reproductive function between husband and wife cannot be regarded as the complete happiness of married life, it can at least be regarded as the key to harmony. If the reproductive function is not perfect, there will never be happiness in the family. Therefore, husbands and wives should strive to maintain the health of this function.

If we do not know hygiene before marriage, our health will obviously change. However, the change in physique after marriage can be said to be equal to that before marriage. There are many people who were energetic and rosy-faced youths before they got married, but unexpectedly became thin and pale after marriage. This is not uncommon. It is also common for those who were weak before marriage to become healthy and beautiful after marriage. However, these reasons are all related to poor health care, and those who lost their health before marriage are mostly due to excessive self-indulgence. Those who lose their health after marriage are caused by immoderate sexual activity. Premature ejaculation, kidney atrophy, and incomplete development are all caused by this. The best way to remedy this is to take "Buti Kang," a testicular seminal substance preparation for men, which is the most suitable for the symptoms. It is because the agent functions to increase sperm and replenish blood, and promote the development of reproductive organs. Countless experts in Europe and the United States all know that the agent's drug power is accurate, and it is an effective preparation for treating neurasthenia, premature aging, and the above-mentioned types of reproductive dysfunction. Anyone whose health declines after marriage will produce sperm and nourish the kidneys within 24 hours after taking this. The love between husband and wife is actually built on the foundation of health, and only "Buti Kang" can consolidate this foundation.

### Differentiation of the Advantages and Disadvantages of Internal Medicines for Seminal Emission

— Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany

Nowadays, most young people are affected by bad environments, advocate freedom, are unrestrained, and indulge in extravagance and romance, so they suffer from seminal emission. This is due to excessive sexual desire. Other self-loving young people are diligent and hardworking, and in addition to the phenomenon of depression, which is everywhere, they feel the pressure of life and the fear of economy, so they have to work hard to solve their life problems. Due to mental fatigue, the nerves gradually turn weak. This creates seminal emission, which is also common.

Regarding the treatment of this disease, first, we must avoid overwork and engage in increasing sperm and nourishing blood to promote the function of metabolism. Taking "Buti Kang" for men, a testicular seminal substance preparation, three times a day, three tablets each time, is very effective in treating neurasthenia, insomnia, waist pain, back pain, premature aging and other symptoms. No matter how serious the symptoms are, it is wonderful to start returning to spring. If you only feel frequent seminal emission, you should also take "Nais Seminal Emission Tablets" to guarantee a radical cure, because the medicinal properties of the two drugs are peaceful and have no side effects. It cannot be compared with other inferior drugs.

### Talking Again About the Problem of Short-Term Treatment of Gonorrhea — Ying Zhongchang, MD, USA

…The life of gonorrhea in test tubes and the human body has different points…Judging the length of treatment with the life of gonorrhea in the test tube is a big mistake

Regarding the problem of whether gonorrhea can be cured radically in the short term, I have published an article in this publication. Now I still want to say more, so as to correct the Fang family.

Everyone knows that the pathogenic bacteria of gonorrhea is diplococcus, but they do not know how diplococcus lives. The life of a bacterium in a test tube is very different from that in the body. Therefore, the life of gonorrhea in a test tube is very easy to annihilate, but if it is in our body, the drugs used for testing still cannot move its hair. The general short-sighted and inexperienced people believe that gonorrhea, which can be killed in a test tube in a few hours, can be cured in three to five days after being used on the human body. How do you know that it is not a big mistake. Our physiology has subtle and different functions and cannot be compared with other inorganic test tubes. Therefore, using the old-fashioned treatment of general osmotic sterilization to radically cure in the short term of three to five days is no different than climbing a tree to catch fish. Therefore, with this kind of hegemonic treatment method, it is of course impossible to complete the responsibility of curing gonorrhea in the short term!

To cure gonorrhea radically is not something that can be achieved by the over-the-counter drugs that are generally advertised on the market, claiming that it can be cured in three to five days. According to my own experience and the opinions of gonorrhea experts from various countries in the world, the "Kelinong" invented by the German gonorrhea expert Dr. Bi Sui has received unanimous praise. For initial leucorrhea, it can be cured radically in two or three weeks, and for those who have turned into chronic diseases, it will be rooted out in four or five weeks. This is not the statistical index I have obtained over the past ten years, but also the only reliable short-term treatment for gonorrhea by experts from all over the world. Because "Kelinong" has the effect of anti-inflammatory and bacteriophage, it can be step-by-step, short-term cure of gonorrhea that is difficult to cure radically. Because generally speaking, three to five weeks to cure leucorrhea radically is a necessary process.

Deliberation on Leucorrhea Treatment

In Vain Suffering from Leucorrhea Patients

Of course, to cure a difficult disease radically, it is not enough to just shout out a new treatment, and the disease will be cured out of thin air. Recently, there has been a surge of gonorrhea treatments like bamboo shoots after a rain. What is even more strange is that general urban doctors today claim that the method they use to treat gonorrhea is the latest and most omnipotent, and by tomorrow, they will change to a new name and criticize their own treatment used yesterday as backward and outdated. I think that although medicine has made rapid progress today, it is probably not progressing so fast! What is suffering is that general gonorrhea patients are wandering on the fork in the road, at a loss, and delaying the condition, isn't this caused by those dazzling urban doctors who give to the poor gonorrhea patients?

The Radical Cure Method of Eliminating Poison

Our treatment of gonorrhea always relies on experimentation. Any treatment that has been radically cured by experimentation must have scientific preparation lines, and those that conform to scientific standards are not effective today and ineffective tomorrow. What is said is that the river will flow forever, and this is also the meaning. I have been in clinical practice for nearly 20 years. Every year, new treatments are used, and it cannot be said that they are not thorough, but most of them are famous but not practical. In my nearly 20 years of experience, in terms of electrotherapy, German static electrotherapy has the best sterilization power, and if X-rays are used to assist, the effect is even better. On the one hand, take the world's unanimously recognized gonorrhea holy medicine "Kelinong" internally to promote the body's cells to produce anti-gonorrhea bacteriophage, so that the gonorrhea scattered everywhere can be eliminated in one fell swoop. Therefore, anyone who applies such scientific treatments will not relapse after healing. Because this is the meaning of eliminating poison thoroughly. Diagnosis time is from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. Starting today, 10 diagnosis numbers will be sent out every day, and each number will only cost 5 cents.

### Lung Disease Health Method

— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang

Lung disease is the most chronic disease. It takes a long time to treat, and it also requires a lot of money. Therefore, some people say that tuberculosis is a rich disease, which means that only people with money are qualified to get this disease, and people without money only have a dead end. But that's not true. No matter what kind of lung disease, according to my experience over the years, "Bufei Naier" is indeed an effective preparation for governing the first two or three stages of lung disease, because the characteristics of this agent are to nourish the lungs and search for tuberculosis, and at the same time, it has the function of promoting appetite and relieving coughs and phlegm. Without the need for surgical operations, it can make up for lung depression and cavities. Major lung disease sanatoriums and experts in Europe and the United States all instruct patients to take this agent at home. As a result, many have achieved satisfactory results.

### Western Shanghai Border Area: Factory Construction Accelerates, Transforming into a Commercial Center; Building Permits Issued Exceed Last Month

The Shanghai Times reports that shops, factories, and residences are being built in the western Shanghai area, with the northwest section of the Public Concession being the most active. The outer areas of Shanghai are rapidly transforming into a center for factories and commerce, with many being built on roads bordering the Concession. Although some citizens have protested against the disruption of residential areas, the construction of factories and the like is accelerating. Even a door-to-door survey cannot obtain reliable statistics, and there is apparently no official organization to compile such statistics. The Municipal Council naturally has no official information either, but it does keep count of buildings constructed within the Concession. An informal and simple survey of construction activities has been undertaken, which can also reveal the extent of construction outside the Concession. From December 1st of last year to the 17th of this month, no fewer than fifteen factory construction permits have been approved by the Municipal Council, all in western Shanghai. Eight of these permits were issued in December, and seven were issued in the first three weeks of this month. Furthermore, in the period from December 1st to January 17th, 129 shop construction permits were issued, of which 102 were in western Shanghai; 62 residential building permits were issued, all in western Shanghai; 35 permits for the construction of Chinese-style bungalows were issued, of which 32 were in western Shanghai; and 36 permits for the construction of Chinese businesses were also issued, all in western Shanghai. By the end of this month, a comparison will likely show that the number of permits issued this month will slightly exceed the number issued last month.

### Jiaotong University on Haig Road: All Safe and Sound; Rumors Circulating Outside are Entirely False

Late last night, rumors suddenly spread that the refugee camp inside Jiaotong University on Haig Road in Xujiahui, western Shanghai, had been stormed by more than ten people, and that gunshots had been heard. This newspaper's reporter immediately went to the Louza Police Station to inquire, and was told that there was absolutely no such incident. Subsequently, they went to Jiaotong University on Haig Road to investigate and saw three police officers guarding the gate: a foreign police officer, a Russian police officer, and a Chinese police officer, whose number was 742. According to the Chinese police officer, the area was very peaceful today, and the rumors circulating outside were entirely false.

### Pseudo-Army Uses Search as Pretext to Kidnap and Extort

According to someone from Gao Hang in Pudong, Xu Hongfa's troops, a pseudo-"army" in Chuansha, used the pretext of searching for guerrillas to enter the town and select wealthy households to kidnap people for ransom. The other day, in eastern Gao Hang, not far from Gaoqiao, twelve villagers were captured by Xu's troops. Before leaving, his henchmen told people to quickly prepare money for ransom, saying that they would send the money to the Japanese military, as a form of intimidation. The villagers are in a dire situation, with no means of survival.

### Rickshaw Driver Run Over by Car

Wu Tugeng, a Changzhou native nearly forty years old and a rickshaw driver at the Chengji stables at the intersection of Columbia Road in western Shanghai, was suddenly knocked to the ground by a Westerner's car yesterday afternoon, suffering severe injuries to his head, arms, and other areas. A street police officer from the Jing'an Temple Police Station spotted the incident and quickly summoned an ambulance, which rushed him to the hospital for treatment.

### Banking and Finance Industry Friendship Association Forms Welfare Mutual Aid Group

The Shanghai Banking and Finance Industry Amateur Friendship Association, organized by people in the banking and finance industries in Shanghai, has been established for less than three years, but its affairs are thriving and are highly praised by financial circles. Recently, the association has been preparing a welfare mutual aid group, the purpose of which is to stabilize the lives of its members and ensure that those engaged in the banking and finance industry can live and work in peace. The welfare mutual aid group was proposed by the association's Welfare Committee and includes loan, health, economic assistance, and children's education groups. All members of the association can join as members, and once they join, they can enjoy the aforementioned benefits. Small matters such as haircuts, bathing, medical care, and hygiene can be resolved free of charge, while larger issues such as personal finances, life insurance, unemployment, accident protection, and children's education can also be easily addressed, benefiting society and the people. It is said that people in the finance industry have responded enthusiastically, and authorities of various banks and pawnshops are happy to help make it happen.

### Passengers Traveling South Must Be Vaccinated Against Smallpox

The English-language North China Daily Mail reports that there was a slight error in yesterday's publication regarding the vaccination certificate requirements for those traveling to Hong Kong and Manila. The corrected information is as follows: For those traveling to Hong Kong, only vaccination certificates issued by the Municipal Council, with a photo of the vaccinated person attached and stamped with the Health Department's seal, are valid if traveling in third class or steerage. Passengers traveling in first and second class can use vaccination certificates signed and certified by a well-known doctor in Shanghai, which are also valid. As for Manila, vaccination certificates issued by the Municipal Council and by the Shanghai doctors listed by the shipping companies sailing to Manila are valid. As far as the personnel of the Municipal Council's Health Department know, the regulations in Manila do not require a photograph of the vaccinated person to be attached to the vaccination certificate.

### Call for Plain Clothing from All Walks of Life; Origin of the Plain Clothing Association

Since various circles in this city launched a campaign to advocate wearing plain clothing and to organize a Plain Clothing Association, the news has been publicized and has been met with enthusiastic responses from all sides, eagerly hoping that the association will be established as soon as possible. This is because such an organization not only conforms to the principle of frugality but also benefits the national economy and the people's livelihood. The origin of the association is recorded below: "It is said that if the country is extravagant, show it frugality; if the country is frugal, show it etiquette. How true this is! Indeed, it is timeless. The reasons for our country's weakness are certainly not limited to one aspect, but insightful people say that our country relies on agricultural production for industrial consumption, and those who lead society are accustomed to luxurious enjoyment, the people's livelihood is difficult, and all matters are gradually abandoned. Is this not one of the reasons? Improving life is an essential element of social progress, but a truly progressive society must seek the proximity of the lives of the majority of the people in order to last forever. If we have fat meat in the kitchen and starving people in the fields, then those who enjoy it must feel like they are sitting on a stove and cannot be at ease for a day. Moreover, our country is in such difficult times, broken and displaced, if we do not work diligently and thriftily, with one heart and one mind, how can we save the country from danger and achieve the success of revival? Looking back at ancient history, when Wei suffered enemy invasion and the country was broken and the people were exhausted, when Duke Wen came to the throne, he wore clothes of coarse cloth and a hat of coarse silk, and worked hard to govern. In the first year, he reduced thirty chariots, and in the following year, he reduced three hundred chariots. The people gathered and the government rose, and Wei was restored. Yu governed the floods, with meager diet, disliked fine clothes, and lived in humble palaces. Therefore, Confucius praised him as 'I have no fault to find.' Now that sovereignty is in the hands of the people, and the fate of the country is turning around, it also depends on the collective efforts. We all believe that clothing is a matter of shaping the body, and enjoyment and boasting all start with clothing. Those who wear beautiful clothes and gorgeous decorations are often accustomed to laziness. Therefore, we have specifically launched the Plain Clothing Association to encourage each other to be frugal and diligent, hoping that a journey of a thousand miles will start with a single step, and a mountain of nine inches will start with a basket of soil. The success of construction depends on the collective efforts to see its completion. Fellow countrymen and gentlemen, why not come here?"

### Moore Memorial Church Social Service Group Distributes Clothing and Rice to Refugees; Continues to Promote and Expand Relief Efforts; Plans to Add Medical Relief Organization

The Social Service Group of the Youth Department of Moore Memorial Church in this city, in view of the refugees gathered on the streets and in the alleys, which is heartbreaking to see, the group members have been collecting cotton quilts and clothes, etc., and held the first distribution yesterday at Moore Memorial Church on Yu Qiaqing Road. The details are recorded below: (1) The group members went to various places in the evening to investigate the situation of the refugees, made reports, and registered the names of the refugees for reference. (2) Relief standards: A. Young children who are more susceptible to disease; B. Elderly and weak people who are susceptible to disease; C. Teenagers under sixteen years old, without work, lonely and helpless; D. Hard laborers who cannot support their family; E. Middle-aged singles who cannot work due to illness. (3) After the group members inquired about their suffering in detail, they registered their names and gave them certificates, instructing them to gather in front of the church on time to wait for the distribution of relief clothing. (4) The group set up a review committee to determine the amount of items to be distributed based on the reports of the investigators, numbered and distributed them. (5) The group collected various needed items from Western missionaries who are enthusiastic about public welfare, the Children's Welfare Association, the People's Livelihood Canteen, and a portion of the donations for the Christmas festival, for distribution. (6) At 3 o'clock that day, they sat in order in the auditorium of Moore Memorial Church, and the host of the group gave a speech and administered smallpox vaccinations according to the numbers (Municipal Council Health Department), followed by the distribution of relief items. (7) The number of people receiving relief items was more than 600, including more than 400 cotton jackets, 53 cotton quilts, more than 100 children's clothes, and 1,000 rice coupons (one catty each). It is learned that Mr. Cai Huangsheng, the secretary of the group, said that they plan to continue to promote and expand relief efforts, and in view of the fact that many refugees are sick and unable to receive treatment, which is tantamount to sitting and waiting for death, they plan to add a medical relief organization, and hope that people from all walks of life will provide assistance.

### Dispute over Eviction: Tenant Refuses to Move and Prepares to Appeal

Wu Hongda, a local resident of No. 314 Maiqi Road, French Concession, is 37 years old and owns a three-story, three-room and two-wing residential building at No. 18, Lane 79, Zhao Bishop Road. He rents it to seven tenants: Ding Mingshi, Tao Peiyuan, Gu Jingliang, Gu Dianshao, Mrs. Lin, Shen Weisun, Xu Bingsheng, etc., with a total monthly rent of 180 yuan. The monthly rent for each tenant ranges from 33 yuan to 15 yuan. The landlord, Wu Hongda, mortgaged the land of the house to Feng Shouzheng. Due to the overdue debt, the creditor pressed the Special Second Court's Civil Division to rule for execution of the auction. Subsequently, Wu sold the house to Lu Donghou on June 18 of last year for 50,000 yuan. Later, in October of last year, Wu Hongda and the new owner, Lu Donghou, hired lawyers Zhou Rong and Qian Jianqiu to file a lawsuit with the Special Second Court's Civil Division against the seven tenants, including Ding Mingshi, demanding eviction. The defendant tenants, Ding Mingshi and the other six, hired lawyer Qian Xingzhong to defend them, arguing based on the circumstances and the law, and objecting to the eviction on the grounds that they did not owe rent. The case was opened and investigated repeatedly, and the details have been reported in previous newspapers. The case has been declared closed for debate, and the court ruled the other day to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit, with the litigation costs to be borne by the plaintiffs. It is reported that the plaintiffs are very dissatisfied with the first-instance judgment and are preparing to appeal to the High Branch Court to achieve the purpose of eviction. However, in this isolated island where there are many people and few houses, disputes over housing eviction are endless, which is truly a great difficulty for the courts. It is unknown how this case will end in the future.

### Notes on Huang Xiaoting's Painting Exhibition

Huang Xiaoting, a painter from Jiangxi, has a noble character. His works combine the achievements of various masters of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, and are applied to the tip of his brush, making him a giant in the art world. Recently, in response to the encouragement of friends, he displayed more than a hundred of his accumulated masterpieces at the Central Grand Hotel on Wuma Road. I went to visit the exhibition and found that the works were truly exquisite. For example, his imitation of Da Chi's "Group Peaks Accumulating Snow" is refined in brushwork and simple in ink, rich and calm. His imitation of Xinluo's landscape handbook has lively lines and stable colors, without being greasy or flamboyant. His imitation of Gou Daoren's landscape has a secluded and elegant charm that can be read endlessly. Other imitations of Xiangguang's ink rhyme are mellow, pure, and simple, yet achieve a wonderful effect. The majesty of Shanchiao, the splash ink of Fangshan, the strength of Shitian, and the breadth of Fanghu are as if he is holding the souls of the ancients and capturing them all under his brush. The grandeur of his artistic conception cannot be described in words. There is also a painting of "Ziling Fishing Platform," with a spirit that is ancient, lush, clear, strong, and elegant, all of which are scenes of Fuchun. It is said that Mr. Huang has lived in Fuchun for more than ten years, so he has a unique perspective on the scenery of the Fuchun River. Overall, the strength of the gentleman lies in immersing himself in the methods of the ancients, but also being able to create his own new ideas, and not being confined by the ancients. As for flowers, figures, birds, and animals, all are exquisite, unrestrained, and make people yearn for them.

### Cuckoo Occupying the Magpie's Nest: Robbed Clean

The address of No. 317 Santai Wharf Lane in Nanshi was formerly the Yuanxing medicinal materials warehouse. Before the National Army withdrew in the winter of the year before last, the warehouse owner moved the valuable medicinal materials to the Concession, but a large number of medicinal materials were left behind, all piled up in the house (which was three stories high with three rooms and two wings). Three warehouse workers were assigned to guard the house. From the spring to the summer of last year, the house was searched and robbed by local bandits five or six times. All the medicinal materials were stolen by the bandits with flatbed carts. Even the three guards were beaten and injured by the bandits. The warehouse workers then locked the empty house and left. In July of last year, a Ningbo native named Zhao Lianfa, who was a machine coppersmith and formerly worked in a shipyard, and now works as a foreman in a shipyard set up by the Japanese at the South Wharf in Pudong, moved into the empty house because he had no place to live. He has lived there for more than five months. Because his daily wages were good, he had some money left over, so he brought his family from Ningbo to live with him in the house, which attracted the covetousness of the bandits. The night before last (21st), at more than half past midnight, seven bandits suddenly came, broke into the house, and held torches and weapons, each holding knives and clubs. They first grabbed Zhao and forced him to hand over money, but failed, so they beat him and searched the house. It is estimated that they robbed more than 70 yuan in cash and more than 100 yuan worth of cotton clothes, pants, overcoats, and quilts before escaping.

### Girl Falls from Building

Lu Xiaomei, a girl from Shaoxing, who is only four years old, accidentally fell from the building at around twelve o'clock yesterday noon, causing a severe head injury. Her family members summoned an ambulance. It is said that her injury is serious and her life is in danger.

### Shanghai Special: Shanghai School Education During the War of Resistance (Continued)

— Chonggan

From the table above, it can be seen that there are as many as 350 schools in the war-torn occupied areas. Private unregistered schools and special areas on the original site that have been forced to close due to environmental constraints are not included. Moreover, elementary schools have far less economic power than universities and middle schools, so very few can move to the safe areas of the Concession to resume classes. However, the establishment of elementary schools is like bamboo shoots after a rain, even more numerous than universities and middle schools. According to recent surveys and statistics, there are currently 403 elementary schools in the city, with 113,365 students, a decrease of about 170 schools compared to before the war. If we compare the current situation with the past geographical area, it cannot be said to be small in quantity. However, in terms of quality, some schools urgently need to be improved.

4. Compulsory Education

Compulsory education in Shanghai was implemented in accordance with central government regulations, starting in the 24th year of the Republic [1935]. Although it only had two years of history by the time the War of Resistance began, the undertaking had already taken shape. The various facilities in the 25th year of the Republic [1936] are listed separately below to show a glimpse of them.

1. Short-term Elementary Schools: 24 schools were set up in the first semester, including 17 schools with three classes and 7 schools with two classes. 26 schools were set up in the second semester, including 19 schools with three classes and 7 schools with two classes.

2. Short-term Elementary School Classes: 100 classes were set up in the first semester and 110 classes in the second semester.

3. Additional Junior Elementary Schools: In the first semester, 4 more schools were added than in the 24th year of the Republic [1935], including 2 schools with two grades and 2 schools with a single grade. In the second semester, 3 more schools were added than in the first semester, including 2 schools with two grades and 1 school with a single grade.

4. Expansion of Existing School Grades: 28 grades were added in the first semester compared to the 24th year of the Republic [1935], and 18 grades were added in the second semester compared to the first semester.

5. Promotion of Two-Part System Schools: 4 grades were added in the first semester compared to the 24th year of the Republic [1935], and 4 grades were added in the second semester compared to the first semester.

6. Implementation of Mobile Education: A special Zhenpu Mobile Education Experimental Zone was set up to recruit students equivalent to three classes of short-term elementary schools.

The above are all the compulsory education facilities at the end of the 25th year of the Republic [1936] before the start of the War of Resistance in Shanghai. Because this undertaking was entirely run by the government, with no private funding, it was difficult to maintain after the end of the educational administrative organs and the cut off of funding. Moreover, the original undertakings were scattered in the suburbs, making it even more difficult to restore them. Therefore, except for a small number of short-term elementary school teachers on the original sites who painstakingly managed to set up schools in safe areas, with about 40 grades, the rest of the undertakings were all suspended. Moreover, due to economic difficulties and the lack of self-provided school buildings, they had to borrow from ordinary schools, and the recurring expenses could not but be subsidized by charging students fees. This is different from before the war, when no fees were charged and school supplies were provided. Fortunately, all educational facilities comply with central government regulations, which is comforting.

5. Conclusion

Overall, in terms of school education during the War of Resistance in Shanghai, the number of higher education, secondary education, and primary education has increased or remained the same, but compulsory education has not been able to quickly restore its former state. However, in terms of quality, there is still much that needs to be done by educational personnel. I would like to briefly describe my limited views below.

1. In the future, the establishment of schools at all levels should focus on practical education and adapt to the actual needs of the city's environment, with national defense construction as the highest principle.

2. School buildings and grounds must be expanded to the extent possible, so as not to hinder the normal and healthy development of students' physical and mental well-being.

3. The faculty must be improved and enriched to ensure that every teacher can be a role model for students in terms of knowledge, experience, and morality. Equipment must be purchased in consideration of economic conditions, and schools can cooperate to do so if necessary.

4. The amount of fees paid by students should not be raised excessively. In the aftermath of the war, people's livelihoods are deteriorating, and increasing the burden on students will lead to the worry of being unable to afford school. Education should be for education's sake, and the accumulated ills of commercialization should be reversed.

5. Youth training should be strict, reversing the past trend of laxity, so that every student is aware of the importance of the mission they bear during the War of Resistance and knows what to strive for.

6. Unregistered schools should complete the registration procedures as soon as possible within the possible scope to avoid misleading students and hindering their development prospects. (End)

### Guerrilla Warfare Active Everywhere, Japanese Troops in Dire Straits; Japanese Prostitutes and Vagrants Accompany Japanese Troops, Committing Fraud and Deception Everywhere, Causing Annoyance and Resentment

The Continental Daily reports that, according to a Chinese merchant returning from the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway area yesterday (the 31st), prostitutes, vagrants, and swindlers are entering the Chinese interior along with the Japanese troops. Whenever they arrive at a place, they become objects of insult and extortion by Japanese soldiers and vagrants. However, Chinese guerrilla forces often launch attacks. Wherever there are Japanese soldiers, there are wine shops, dance halls, and brothels, because

Prostitutes and Vagrants

travel with the Japanese troops everywhere. For example, there are many brothels and dance halls in Suzhou. In reality, there is not much difference between the two. Japanese troops still massacre or mistreat Chinese civilians, and Japanese planes still bomb villages in their rear. Whenever the Japanese troops hear of active guerrilla activity somewhere, they immediately dispatch planes to bomb the area without further investigation, regardless of whether there are guerrillas there or not.

Many Villages are Bombed.

Two weeks ago, a wounded farmer who had been bombed walked from Xinzhuang, twenty miles away, to Jiaxing for medical treatment. The guerrillas near Xinzhuang have been causing the Japanese troops anxiety for several weeks. The Japanese troops angrily dispatched 500 men to try to disperse the guerrillas. At that time, the guerrillas were stationed in Wuzhen. The guerrilla spies in Jiaxing had already reported the information of the Japanese troops' impending invasion to the

Guerrilla Force,

who made preparations in advance. They left some soldiers to lure the Japanese troops traveling on sampans to sail up the river beside Wuzhen. The narrower the river became, the closer they got to the ambush. They lured the Japanese troops to land and attacked them from behind. The Japanese troops were unprepared and panicked, scrambling back into the sampans to escape. However, due to the extreme chaos, many were killed or wounded on the spot. Only 300 men escaped back to Jiaxing. The next day, the Japanese dispatched three planes to bomb the guerrillas.

But What They Bombed

was not Wuzhen, where the guerrillas were stationed, but Xinzhuang, which was ten miles away from the town. A week later, the Jiaxing puppet newspaper reported that the Japanese troops had gone to Xinzhuang to fight the guerrillas, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and dispersing the guerrillas. The Japanese troops only suffered a few casualties, etc. The Chinese merchant further said that he had heard from travelers on the Nanjing-Shanghai line that the guerrillas

Often Haunt the Railway

area, destroying railway tracks and bridges. The Japanese troops were at a loss and suspected that the guerrillas disguised themselves as passengers and got off at various stations to carry out sabotage. Therefore, there were notices posted at every station with drawings of merchants carrying packages at the station and the words "Passengers on the train must protect the railway," etc. The Japanese troops also had no safety when transporting or mobilizing troops on the highway. Along the larger roads, the Japanese troops built countless fortresses and machine-gun nests, and

In Important Areas

they erected barbed wire fences all around. Some guerrillas attacked from the river, so the Japanese troops erected double barbed wire fences on the riverbanks. Recently, a large number of Japanese merchants have been going to Suzhou and Jiaxing, carrying silk fabrics, medicines, and other goods. However, most Chinese people do not use Japanese medicines and cosmetics. Japanese women are the only customers for cosmetics.

However, Japanese Cloth

sells quite widely. Japanese vagrants in the Hongkou and Yangpu districts also travel with the Japanese troops in large numbers, causing trouble and doing all kinds of evil. This is because they know that no one dares to complain to the Japanese military police. In the occupied towns and villages between Nanjing and Shanghai, the Japanese do not have sufficient troops stationed. Therefore, they are often the target of guerrilla attacks. For example, Wujiang, which is fifteen miles away from Suzhou,

a Large Detachment of Japanese Troops

returned to Wujiang, but the guerrillas had already left. Therefore, the guerrillas constantly attacked and harassed the Japanese troops, while the Japanese troops engaged in direct combat with the guerrillas. Both sides suffered losses, but the Japanese troops' casualties, military supplies, and financial losses were far greater than those of the guerrillas.

### Zhong Xinpu Denies His Nephew; Court Sternly Rejects It; Initial Trial Verdict Appealed and Again Rejected; Regardless of Whether Married into Another Family, Bloodline Cannot be Severed

Zhong Pinfang, a local resident, currently living at 260 Hartung Road, lost his mother at a young age and lived with his maternal grandparents. The Zhong family originally lived in an old house in the city and had some assets. Pinfang's grandmother, Mrs. Yang, and Pinfang's uncle, Xinpu (formerly a senior official at the post office), lived together. When the war broke out, they moved to the Helanfang neighborhood on Fulu Road, but

Pinfang and his mother, because the house there was small, still lived separately. After his grandmother, Mrs. Zhong Yang, died in the summer of last year, Zhong Xinpu suddenly claimed that Pinfang's father (i.e., his younger brother) had married into the Shen family ten years ago. Therefore, he denied that Zhong Pinfang was Mrs. Zhong Yang's grandson. Pinfang was not listed in the printed obituary. Pinfang then

Protested to His Uncle Xinpu. After mediation by relatives and friends failed, he filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special Second Court against Zhong Xinpu to confirm his identity. He hired lawyers Zhang Hongwei and Wu Chuliang to represent him, citing Article 967 of the Civil Code and the Supreme Court's case No. 2143 of the Republic of China year 22, "Blood relations cannot be extinguished by the consent of the parties."

They attacked, and clarified that regardless of whether there was marriage into another family, even if there was such an event, blood relations could not be severed, etc. The initial trial verdict confirmed that Zhong Pinfang was the grandson of Mrs. Zhong Yang. The defendant, Zhong Xinpu, refused to accept this and filed an appeal with the High Second Branch Court, stating reasons. After repeated summonses and deliberations by the collegiate panel,

Research and Trial, the court declared that the defendant had no sufficient reasons, and that the original judgment was without error. The court opened on the previous day, ruling that the appeal was rejected, and that the appellant was to bear the costs of litigation for the first and second trials.

### Fierce Bandit in the Fahua Area; Resists Arrest and Escapes; Flees into the Concession for Treatment and is Eventually Captured; Yesterday Sent to Court for Sentencing and Temporarily Detained in the Western Jail

Personnel from the Public Concession Police Department had captured ten male and female bandits in the Fahua area of Shanghai. At that time, they were taken away by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters on Jessfield Road, who considered that they had to review their activities, whether they had joined the guerrilla work. After extracting them on January 12, up to the present, it is heard that they have not been returned to the Police Department. Thus, the police cannot be brought to the Special First Court for prosecution. Only at the time the personnel of the Police Department were searching and arresting in Fahua, there was a local fierce bandit, named Fu Bao Lin (transliteration) who opened fire, resisted arrest and escaped. The Police Department immediately ordered its subordinates to step up the arrest. Unexpectedly, the bandit was injured when he resisted arrest and fled to the Concession for medical treatment. He was captured by detectives and sent to the Public Works Department Hospital. Yesterday, the police brought him to the court for interrogation and he was sentenced to three and a half years of hard labor and sent to Ward Road Prison for temporary detention, waiting for other bandits to be returned by the Japanese side, and the case will be handled together.

### Enticing a Girl; Sentenced to Eight Months

Huatanmupai Shaochang of Gordon Road Police Station, previously in a house at 918 Pinang Road, arrested a Anhui woman Zhang Wu, who enticed children, recovered two 11-year-old Jiangbei girl Luo Xiaozier and 8-year-old girl Zhang Gendi, and brought them to the police station and sent them to the First Special District Court. Both girls were taken back by their families, and Zhang Wu was returned to custody. Former Magistrate Huang Risheng of the Agriculture Court came to court for continued trial. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer for the Police Station, stated that the chief offender, the woman Zhan Yang, could not be arrested. It was found that the two girls were enticed by Zhan Yang, who paid 30 yuan and asked the defendant to keep them in her house, intending to take them to Tianjin to sell and profit from them. Inquired about the actual operation, her confession was ambiguous. Then, the two girls proved that they were not allowed to speak loudly upstairs in her house, called her "mother", and were not allowed to go downstairs, etc. Magistrate Huang sentenced Zhang Wu to eight months of imprisonment as a warning.

### Young Girl Learning to Drive; Hits a Pedestrian

A Chinese girl, about ten years old, was learning to drive a private car on Great Western Road near Dunxin Road at 11:15 yesterday afternoon. However, her skills were poor, and she crashed recklessly, knocking pedestrian Zhang Zhikang (age 17, residing at 35, Lane 612, Hart Road) to the ground, causing serious injuries. At the same time, a Mobil gasoline pump column erected there was also knocked down. Afterwards, the nearby police station at No. 2788 heard the alarm and immediately called an ambulance to rush to the scene, sending the injured to the hospital for treatment. The girl who caused the accident was taken to the police station for investigation.

### Gordon Road Police Station; Captures Gambling Boats; Detains Two Key Criminals, Sentencing Scheduled

Mao Axiang, a flower club leader who has been wanted by the authorities for many times, relying on the protection of certain western special forces, set up a large flower club factory in the tobacco and gambling area, opening three rounds a day. In recent months, the money cheated has been no less than ten thousand. During the week, the Concession Police Authorities, in addition to blocking the main traffic routes connecting the tobacco and gambling dens, also sent detectives to conduct strict inspections at the intersection. The gamblers were deeply afraid that when the induced gambling boats passed by, they would be arrested and investigated. Then, the gambling money hidden on their bodies would be confiscated. Therefore, they specifically notified all boats that anyone carrying flower club notes should hand over all gambling money to other boats. The idea was very thoughtful, and the flower club factory was moved to Gongyi Lane on Rue Robert, which is close to the Concession. It is said that this is still a branch factory, while the main factory is still located in Caojiadu. Cao Amao, a famous rogue in the Putuo Road area, is now willing to act as a lackey, hired as a boatman. He hires Liu Ahai, who spends all day collecting gambling money from those who gamble on the flower club. The other day, detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station first intercepted Liu on the way, and then arrested Cao Amao at 80 Penang Road. They immediately searched his house and found a register recording the names of the flower club. The other day, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Magistrate Dai interrogated them. Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer for the Police Station, charged them with the crime of gathering to gamble and presented the seized material evidence, requesting punishment. Liu confessed without denial, while Cao was cunning, saying that he worked at the Xielong Glass Factory, and that the records were all goods accounts, and that he was falsely accused by Liu. He also hired two lawyers, Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, to defend him, requesting bail. The court ordered Cao to pay 400 yuan as bail, and Liu was returned to custody, awaiting sentencing.

### Kenne Road; Squatter Huts Difficult to Relocate

There are more than 200 squatter huts in the Kenne Road area of the Northern District. Because the landlord of the address intends to build houses, he intended to give each household 10 yuan as relocation funds, ordering all squatter huts to relocate. However, the squatters believe that once they relocate, there will be no place to live, so the deadline has been extended to this day, which has been two months. Each squatter hut is still unwilling to relocate.

### Kan Ze's Sword; Brought to Shanghai to Wait for Sale; Excavated from the Former Residence of the Wu Prime Minister of the Three Kingdoms

The Cihu Lake near the suburbs of Ningbo Cixi County has beautiful scenery with rippling waves and reflections. Its location is the former residence of Kan Ze, the Prime Minister of the Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. Recently, a resident with the surname Wang was digging the ground near the lake when he discovered an ancient sword. It was covered in rust and had an ancient feel. According to the appraisal of archaeologists, it is an ancient artifact from thousands of years ago. Since the place used to be the former residence of the Wu Prime Minister, Mr. Li, who works in Shanghai, took the item to Shanghai, seeking a good price for it.

### Theft Case on Tiantong Road

A residence with the surname Mou at No. 7, Lane 615, Tiantong Road, was suddenly broken into by three bandits at around 8:15 yesterday evening. Two of the bandits were carrying firearms, threatening the men and women in the house and prohibiting them from making a sound. They drove them to a corner of the house and guarded them, while the unarmed bandits rushed into the inner rooms. As a result of the search, the bandits snatched clothes and money totaling more than 230 yuan and fled. Afterwards, the owner went to the police station in charge to report and request a pursuit.

### Foreigner Injured and Unconscious; Severe Head Injury; Remains Unconscious After Treatment

The Chinese-language newspaper *Zi Lin Bao* reports that, yesterday (the 21st), shortly after noon, a police officer was passing through a lane near the east side of East Seward Road when he found a foreigner who had lost consciousness. By the early morning of today, he was still unconscious, so it was impossible to determine who he was. It is believed that he is a Russian. He had a severe head injury and blood was flowing from his ears and nose. He was immediately taken to the Hongkew Police Station, where first aid was administered, but it was impossible to revive him. An ambulance was called and the person was taken to the Country Hospital for treatment of his injuries. As of this morning, it was learned that the person was still unconscious and unable to be revived. The cause of the injury is still unknown. Detectives from the Hongkew Police Station are continuing to investigate.

### Falsely Established Silk Shop; Issuing Checks Indiscriminately; Swindling Fellow Silk Merchants; Check Deadline Approaching; Owners and Partners Flee Together; Yunlin and Dahua Shops Sued for Being Swindled

Ding Shanhao from Ningbo established a Ruikang Silk Shop on South Wuxi Road, hiring Li Zhensheng from Jiaxing as a runner, using bad checks to swindle silk from fellow merchants. On the 27th of last month, with the swindled amount of goods being large, and the issued checks all about to expire, he abandoned the shop and fled. Yunlin and Dahua Silk Shops, which were swindled, separately filed criminal self-suits for fraud with the First Special District Local Court. After the court opened and learned that both defendants had fled without a trace, it ruled to issue arrest warrants. However, Hu Huanwen, the owner of Dahua Shop, after filing the self-suit, also hired a lawyer to report to the Laozha Police Station that Ding and Li had issued 500 yuan in bad checks from the Donglai Bank, swindling goods. The police station initially did not know that a self-suit had already been filed, and thus investigated and confirmed the facts. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed against Ding and Li. It was not until the trial the other day that the previous situation was learned, and the court immediately applied to withdraw the public prosecution case.

### Dyeing Factory Manager Assassinated; Bullet Through Abdomen and Back, Killed; Conflicting Rumors Regarding the Reason for the Murder; Police Authorities Investigating Closely

Chen Ningchao from Ningbo, age 50, residing at No. 20, Zhichengfang, Lane 300, Rue Galle, French Concession, has been the manager of Yingfeng Dyeing Factory for many years. The factory's business department is located at No. 20, Yingchunfang, Daxin Street, Hubei Road, Public Concession. Recently, Chen was auditing the accounts at the Yingfeng Factory's business department and had not returned home for two days and nights. At about 5:00 p.m. on the 21st, Chen returned to his residence at Zhichengfang, Rue Galle.

He was sitting in the living room, chatting, drinking tea, and smoking cigarettes with his family when, about half an hour later, a person wearing a long robe suddenly called Chen out to talk in the alley. Chen followed him out of the door. When they walked to the trash can in the cross alley of Zhichengfang, three or four people in short clothes emerged and fired a handgun at Chen. The people then scattered and fled out of the alley. Chen was hit by a bullet in the upper right of his abdomen,

penetrating his back and waist, and he fell to the ground, screaming for help. When his family and neighbors heard the sound and appeared, the murderer had already fled without a trace. The family immediately reported to the French Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. An ambulance was immediately summoned to rush Chen to Guangci Hospital. After the doctor performed surgery, because the injury was in a vital spot and the blood loss was excessive, he died at 10 p.m. that night. The hospital notified the police station, which transported the body to the autopsy center attached to the Public Works Department Hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour, to be inspected by the Second Special District Court today. The French Police Department has issued a notice to all its detectives to investigate the murderer and bring him to justice. As for the reason for Chen's murder, it is rumored to be due to some kind of relationship, but the rumors are mixed and conflicting. The police station is now conducting a thorough investigation.

### Tailor Shop and Noodle Shop; Two Gangs Clashed in a Crowd Fight; The Whole Family of the Tailor Shop was Beaten and Injured; Ordered to Submit to a Forensic Examination and then Re-Interrogated

Qin Anquan from Ningbo, 31 years old, is a Hongbang tailor, living at No. 150 Rue Massenet, French Concession. As a second landlord, he rented the downstairs shop to Tang Faren from Danyang to open a noodle shop. The other day, Tang's partner urinated in the doorway, causing a conflict with Qin Ruiliang, the young owner of the tailor shop at No. 461 Rue Paul Beau (the tailor shop was established by Qin Anquan's elder brother Qin Anshou). The two sides invited about 20 partners and

they fought with each other, the situation was tense, as if facing a great enemy. As a result, Qin Anquan, Qin Anshou, Qin Duanliang (Anshou's son and Anquan's nephew), the brothers, father, son, uncle and nephew, and the partners Liu Yifa, Zhu Deyun, Cui Su, etc. six people, were led by Tang Faren, together with noodle shop clerks Tang Maotou, Tang Tongfa, Tang Faxian, Pan Jinzhong, etc., using dough sticks to break their heads, blood flowing like pillars. The Songshan Road Patrol Room obtained a report and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene, arresting the perpetrators and confiscating the murder weapon, wooden sticks, and brought them into the police station. The next day, they were sent to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Special Second District Court, where Magistrate Zhu Chuzhe conducted the trial. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer for the French Concession Administration, stated the facts of the case, filed a public prosecution on charges of armed assault, requested a postponement, and re-interrogated after the investigation. The injured Liu Yifa was seriously injured and is now being treated in the hospital, so he did not arrive in court. Qin Anquan and others who were also injured, were all hit on the head and injured. It is requested to investigate. Tang Faren testified that because the second landlord repeatedly ordered the civilians to return the property, he resented it in his heart. Yesterday, the shop clerk urinated in the doorway, causing a conflict with Qin Xiaokai. They then took the opportunity to commit violence, falsely accusing us of assault. In fact, the civilians and shop assistants were also seriously injured. It is requested to examine the injuries. After reviewing the confessions, the court ordered the defendants to be returned to custody, and ordered the victims to submit to a forensic examination, and re-interrogate on the morning of the 27th.

### Owner of the Tianqiao Hotel Robbed; Internal Line from Tea Boy; Seven Irrelevant People Released First; Main Criminal at Large, Remaining Detained Pending Further Interrogation

At about 1:00 p.m. on December 24 last year, the bedroom of Xu Dexiang, the Ningbo owner of the Tianqiao Hotel at No. 58 North Henan Road, was suddenly broken into by several bandits, who seized 6,210 yuan in legal tender from Xu's basket under the bed. They threatened the tea boys with guns to prevent them from making a sound, and then fled. Shang Wu, the Chinese Detective Captain, and Wang Youshan, the detective, of the Huisi Police Station, had arrested Ningbo bandits Fang Huichun, Chai Qingxiang, Mao Abing, Jin Afu, Yang Ansheng, and suspects Ye Huiyuan and the woman Lu Shen, a total of 16 men and women, at No. 19 North Henan Road and No. 6 Baokang Lane on Beijing Road. They were sent to the First Special District Court with a real handgun and four bullets, as well as a fake gun, and placed under investigation. The other morning, Magistrate Huang Risheng came to Criminal Court No. 3 to review the case. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police station, said that after clarifying in the middle of the postponement that Ye Huiyuan, Xu Derong, Wang Jintang, Fan Ruixiang, Wang Xingwang, Jin Axing, and the woman Lu Shen and other seven people were irrelevant, he asked to release them first. The court approved this and said that the hidden money of Xu Dexiang, the owner of Tianqiao Hotel, was robbed by the defendants Ji Acai, Mao Abing, Jin Afu, Yang Ansheng, and Wang Azhi who was at large and two unnamed others. Jin Afu and Yang Ansheng were the internal contacts. Jin was a fishmonger living in the hotel, and Yang was a tea boy who was dismissed a month ago. Knowing that the legal currency was hidden in the basket under the bed of the hotel owner Xu Dexiang, they conspired with Ji Acai and Mao Abing. Mao invited the fugitive leader Wang Azhi and two unnamed others to do this robbery. Afterwards, Ji Acai and Mao Abing each got 20 yuan, Jin Afu got 40 yuan, and Yang Ansheng got 50 yuan. The remaining Fang Huichun and five others are related to the case of Ji Acai's robbery of a resident's property at No. 17 Avenue Joffre, French Concession, etc. After Magistrate Huang interrogated the defendants, their confessions were ambiguous, and they were still returned to custody, to be verified later.

### Mrs. Su's Funeral Held Yesterday

The mother of Mr. Su Xiaxuan of the Ma Teng Engineering Company, Jin Taifuren, passed away in Shanghai on November 24 last year. A mourning hall was set up yesterday (the 22nd) at the Jingtu Temple on Guling Road, Nicheng Bridge. Mr. Su's name is Tinghua, and he studied in France, researching architectural engineering.

### The Grand Conspiracy to Eliminate the Chinese Silk Industry

— Wu Ma

I. Talking About the Past and Two Premises

Since the westward movement of the National Revolutionary Army, the Jiangzhe area, which has long been known as the center of the Chinese silk industry, has successively fallen. At that time, due to the urgency of the situation and the insufficient preparation by the authorities, many silk enterprises that should have been moved inland were left in the war zone. Among them, besides the silk factories, the most noteworthy are, of course, the silkworm egg production farms. We know that the silk factories in the war zone, under the threat of the Japanese and the flattery of several silk industry traitors, are officially working as economic slaves for the Japanese in the name of "cooperation with the Central China Silk Company." For example, the silk factories in Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places are currently in operation, but this only shows that the Japanese oppression has increased and the exploitation has deepened. Who can say how much benefit the many traitorous scoundrels have received from the Japanese, whether in terms of economy or reputation? We can understand this even more from the various harsh conditions and painful experiences of the silk factories in Wuxi after the so-called "cooperation." However, in the past year, the silkworm egg industry in the war zone, on the one hand, was because the Japanese were busy at the time, using the "Central China Company" to seize silk factories in the war zone, and had no time to take care of the egg farms; on the other hand, it was also because the egg production industry did not have scoundrels like Zhang Zizhen and Qian Fenghao in Wuxi. Although there were also people who communicated with the puppet government, but on the whole, they were able to maintain the dignity and integrity of the Republic of China's silkworm egg production farms. This is the evaluation of the silkworm egg industry in the war zone for their perseverance and struggle under such difficult circumstances in the past year!

However, the occupied area is, after all, an occupied area. The Japanese conspiracy against the entire China is ultimately fierce and vicious, and people like You Xiaobiao (the chief of the second section of the Construction Department of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government and concurrently a technician, and concurrently the director of the sericulture control office, who is actually the highest authoritative person in the sericulture administration of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government) are ultimately nothing more than tail-wagging traitors. To continue to operate the silkworm egg production business in the occupied area according to the previous policy, or to maintain the status of the silkworm egg production farms under the protection of people like You Xiaobiao, or even to take the opportunity to obtain some benefits, are all delusional dreams. Because in terms of business: (1) When the nest is overturned, no eggs are left intact, (2) The slaves will never have the guts to interfere with the "master" (?) and participate in discussions. These are two premises that the silkworm egg industry in the war zone should fully recognize.

Therefore: Let us further discuss the "Central China Silk Company's" recent offensive against the silkworm egg production industry in the war zone:

II. Five Conditions for Extinction

Recently, in order to implement the control of the silkworm egg industry in the war zone, and to achieve its goal of seizing or destroying the entire Jiangzhe silk industry, the "Central China Silk Company" has proposed "cooperation" to the Hushuguan Dayou Silkworm Egg Production Farm, which has long been known as the oldest and largest brand in Jiangzhe. This is the first shot fired by the Japanese against the egg farms in the war zone. There is no doubt that it will be promoted to all the egg farms in the Jiangzhe war zone. The conditions for cooperation are tentatively drafted into five articles, which are excerpted as follows:

(1) The original seeds shall be purchased from the company and shall not be reproduced or transferred.

(2) The company shall appoint technical guidance, and the farm shall pay the salary.

(3) The disease rate shall not exceed three per thousand.

(4) The silkworm eggs produced shall be sold by the company and shall not be sold or transferred to others. Half of the payment for the eggs shall be paid upon delivery, and the remainder shall be paid after July for spring eggs and after October for autumn eggs.

(5) If the silkworm eggs issued are of poor quality, the farm shall be responsible for compensation.

Among the five conditions, the first, fourth, and fifth are the most vicious, and the second and third are only the auxiliary of these three. They are further analyzed as follows:

Regarding the first article, it actually contains three sinister meanings. First: Of course, it is to control the silkworm varieties in the war zone, so that the excellent varieties originally cultivated by several larger egg farms will tend to be eliminated. In this way, on the one hand, various egg farms will not be able to obtain original seeds for breeding to produce ordinary silkworm eggs without cooperating with the "Central China Silk Company." In other words: they can only rely on the Japanese. Then, the existence or extinction of the silk industry can also be completely controlled by the Japanese depending on whether or not the Japanese provide original seeds. Second: Since the war, Japan has restricted the import of wool, but because of the barrenness of Japan's wool production, it has had to seek other remedial measures. Therefore, there is the so-called rush wool, that is, the promotion of a fiber that is similar to wool after treating rush with chemicals. However, because the rush used as the raw material for rush wool is not only not as good as the rush used for silk production, but is instead suitable for cotton rush that is not suitable for silk production; therefore, after the promotion of breeding in the country, it was met with fierce opposition from the silk production industry, the reason being that the promotion of this inferior raw material rush will inevitably greatly affect the production of high-quality rush used for silk production. Therefore, if the Japanese control the original seeds in the Jiangzhe war zone, so that all varieties purchase their products, they can of course take the opportunity to import these varieties into the war zone. On the one hand, they can make the Chinese in the war zone produce raw materials for them to achieve their goal of exploitation, and on the other hand, they can also alleviate the opposition of the domestic silk production industry. The third is that the Japanese have always regarded China as their silk enemy country, because China has vast land, abundant manpower, and the silk industry still has great development potential, while Japan is the opposite. Precisely because of this, the threat to Japan's silk kingdom is also the greatest. Therefore, after the fall of Jiangzhe, the main area of China's silk industry, the Japanese government has repeatedly sent domestic silk academic authorities, such as Kogure of Donggao Silk, Fukumoto, and Hayashi Teizo of Ueda, to investigate and inspect one after another, in order to obtain an overall policy for China's silk industry. At that time, there were two kinds of Japanese theories: complete elimination and development. However, the Japanese conspiracy now is to adopt the elimination of development. That is, to carry out controlled development in the Jiangzhe and other war zones; except for the Japanese, the Chinese have no buying and selling relationship with other foreign countries; so that the status of Chinese silk in the world consumer market is eliminated, so that there is no need to worry about the competition between Chinese silk and Japanese silk, and the treasure of the silk industry in the war zone can be obtained. Of course, this goal can be easily achieved by controlling the original seeds in the war zone. The most obvious example is that if the varieties of silkworms that are not suitable for silk production are promoted to the war zone, then the silk factories in Shanghai and the small silk factories in the war zone will not be able to and will not bother to collect the raw material rush produced in the war zone, because this kind of rush is no longer the raw material needed for silk production. This is the so-called "establishing a century-old plan" that the Japanese are shouting loudly! It is also the face of the so-called "economic cooperation" of the Japanese government!

Regarding the second article: The silkworm egg farm not only raises a Japanese in vain, which increases a part of the economic burden; but also, just like the so-called "three Tartars in ten households" in the Yuan Dynasty, this Japanese also has the power to manage the silkworm egg farm and monitor the actions of the Chinese. He is simply the "Taishang Huang" of the silkworm egg farm.

The restriction of the third article is actually a trap to force the egg farm to hire Japanese, and at the same time, the ordinary silkworm eggs in Japan will also have a chance to be dumped in China. Because the past regulations on the disease rate: 20% was burned, and 3% was re-examined; now the disease rate must not exceed three per thousand. On the one hand, it is to make the egg farm feel afraid and feel that it is necessary to hire Japanese technicians. On the other hand, the degree of disease rate inspection is increased, which can reduce the qualified number of ordinary silkworm eggs in the war zone, and then the production volume will also decrease; so that the ordinary silkworm eggs in Japan can be transported to the war zone to exchange for Chinese money. And ensuring that Japan's raw material policy will not fail due to poor silkworm crops is only a secondary matter.

The fourth article controls the production and sales of silkworm eggs, seizes the economy of silkworm eggs, and turns various egg farms into a production machine of the Central China Silk Company—no, machines still have to spend money to buy, and huge capital must be invested; this is simply the serf in the Middle Ages, in addition to desperately doing production work to earn money for the "master," you have to eat when the "master" wants to give you food, and you have to drink porridge when the "master" wants to give you porridge, and you have no choice but to rely on the "Central China Silk Company" of the "master." Because once the production and sales are organized, the relationship between the egg farm and the farmers is completely eliminated, and the silkworm egg farm only has a relationship with the "Central China Silk Company." Isn't this so that the amount of egg price and whether the "Central China Silk Company" should give the egg farm a price, etc., are all decided by the "Company" at will; and the "Central China Silk Company" can directly exchange the silkworm eggs for the farmers' legal currency with military tickets or counterfeit currency to the egg farm. In this way, isn't the silkworm egg farm still a vassal of the Japanese?

Regarding the fifth article: It seems to be beneficial to the farmers, but when everything is in the hands of the Japanese, the silkworm egg farm is only responsible to the "Central China Silk Company." Therefore, the so-called compensation is, in terms of procedures: of course, the silkworm egg farm must first compensate the "Central China Silk Company," and then the "Central China Silk Company" will compensate the farmers. In this way: after a silkworm season ends, the egg price that the "Central China Silk Company" wants to pay to the egg farm can be used as a pretext for poor results, as a reason to default on half of the egg price; and even force the egg farm to compensate for the losses many times over; as for the farmers who are under the oppressive force of the "Japanese puppet," they originally see the Japanese and do not even have time to hide and run away. Who would dare to look for the Japanese because the silkworm crop is not abundant? Even if we take a step back: the Japanese really have the intention to compensate the farmers for their losses.

In short: Although the conditions are only five, they are already thoroughly vicious and fierce, enough to destroy the original silk foundation of China without leaving any traces. If the operators of the silkworm egg farms in the war zone still have a little conscience, if they can still look a little further, they should resolutely refuse.

III. Two Lines for the Future

I heard that after obtaining these superior cooperation conditions, the Dayou Silkworm Egg Farm did not accept them resolutely at that time; but prepared to submit a request to the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Construction Department in the name of the Wuxian Silkworm Egg Industry Guild to express their opposition. The egg farm's disapproval of cooperation with the Japanese is, of course, a gratifying phenomenon; but merely asking for the assistance of the puppet government, we don't care whether this method is applied properly or not, but in terms of effect alone, it is absolutely not enough. Because the traitors are too busy obeying "their master," where would they dare to offer any opinions? This kind of error in understanding seems too inappropriate in the present situation of the total national mobilization of the all-out war of resistance! Then, how should various egg farms deal with it under this vicious oppression? I can say that there is no other way except for absolute non-cooperation. However, the so-called non-cooperation here is not just a matter of passively shutting down the silkworm egg farm, because in this way, the fierce Japanese will use the valuation method to take your silkworm rearing rooms, silkworm rearing equipment, mulberry gardens, etc., as fixed capital, and they will take over the operation. Wouldn't this be more in line with their vicious plan? Therefore, for the current plan, the silkworm egg production farms in the war zone must actively adopt two lines: moving to the guerrilla force area and moving to the rear. The former is to move the movable things as far as possible to the area controlled by the guerrilla forces, in order to prepare for the establishment of the egg production business in the guerrilla area, and at the same time, to completely or partially destroy the immovable things such as silkworm rearing rooms and cocoon rearing rooms, in order to cut off the Japanese's covetous intentions. We know that in the war zone, except for reluctantly maintaining a few transportation lines and larger cities, the other vast rural areas are under the control of the Chinese guerrillas. Therefore, it is no problem for the egg farm to move to the guerrilla area to operate as long as it is willing to give up the current equipment. Moreover, for several egg farms silkworm eggs that are deeply trusted by farmers, such as the Tiger Brand silkworm eggs of Dayou Egg Farm in Hushuguan, the Triangle Brand silkworm eggs of Renxu Hall, and the Three Gourd Brand silkworm eggs of Sanwu Hall in Wuxi, etc., they can still maintain their original status among the farmers in the war zone without being eliminated. Even after driving away the Japanese in the future, it will be an excellent foundation for expansion.

The latter is to move the worthy (please note the word worthy) movable things to the rear, such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and other provinces, as much as possible and as quickly as possible, in order to cooperate with the government to develop the silk industry in the southwest. At the same time, the silkworm rearing rooms, etc., should be burned down to avoid being used by the Japanese. Because the government has repeatedly stated that civilian capital and technology are very much needed, and this is also the time when all the people of the country should do their best. All kinds of production enterprises should follow the government's westward movement. Except for those who are directly engaged in guerrilla work and those who are indirectly disrupting the Japanese control business, there is no reason to live in the occupied area. Now, it is also the time when the occupied area is not allowed to linger. Then, except for moving to the guerrilla force area, there is no doubt that it is only to join the silk production camp in the rear. Fortunately, with the past experience of the silk egg industry in Jiangzhe, whether in terms of management or technology, it is enough to do pioneering work in an area where the silk industry is barren, not to mention the government's assistance.

(I think some larger egg farms have enough strength to advance on both lines at the same time.)

In short, if we can resolutely adopt these two lines as an emergency countermeasure under the current oppressive force of the Japanese, then we can still gain something even if we lose something at the beginning. If we are mad and willing to be economic slaves under the name of "cooperation" with the Japanese, following the same disastrous road of the silk factories in Wuxi and other places, then not only will the operators of the silkworm egg farms be discredited and become the scum of the silk industry; but also the sinners of the Chinese nation! Whether it is meritorious or non-meritorious, it is all in this moment. At this moment when the Japanese are starting to attack the silkworm egg production farms in the war zone, and the silkworm egg farms themselves have not betrayed China and are willing to be vassals of the Japanese, I respectfully reveal what I know in the newspaper to expose the Japanese conspiracy against the silkworm egg industry in the war zone, and to promote the rapid and profound awakening of the silkworm egg industry!

However, sellers, seeing the overcast and rainy weather, which suggests the possibility of snow, were firm in their intentions, resulting in limited transactions. The market for thick and thin Japonica rice was slightly better. The situation for Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian rice remained similar to before. Variable prices, however, were active in sales and lacked supply, making the situation buoyant and prices increasing by one dime.

### Yarn and Cotton: Indian Cotton Weekend Statistics

Bombay dispatch: The Indian cotton statistics from September 1st of last year to January 21st of this year are listed below:

(Unit: 1,000 bales, each bale weighing 400 pounds)

|                         | Bombay | Karachi |

### Coal: Zhoushan Coal Exhausted, Large Shipments Arriving

Household coal bricks, used for daily needs, are nearly exhausted. Winter sales have increased, but local factories are limited by the depletion of Wenzhou coal seams and cannot ship goods, leading to market demand exceeding supply and rising prices. Recently, a certain firm commissioned sailing ships to transport over 300,000 coal bricks from Zhoushan, which have now arrived. They are being offered to colleagues in the industry, divided into large, medium, and small sizes. Large size is 15 yuan per thousand, medium size is 13 yuan, and small size is 11 yuan. Wholesale delivery by colleagues incurs additional cartage fees.

### Seafood: Western Sea Cucumber Sales Strong

Western sea cucumbers have been selling quite well recently, causing local inventories to shrink and quoted prices to tighten. For example, yesterday's offered prices were: selected strips of jade type, 133 yuan; wholesale, 120 yuan; Grade 1 jade, 126 yuan; Grade 2 jade, 118 yuan; Grade 3 jade, 110 yuan; Grade 4 jade, 99 yuan; Grade 5 jade, 89 yuan. Also, red sea cucumber wholesale was Grade 1, 140 yuan; Grade 2, 131 yuan; true Grade 3, 120 yuan; Grade 3, 104 yuan; Grade 4, 19 yuan; Grade 5, 77 yuan. Prices for mid-range jade sea cucumbers, such as Grades 3, 4, and 5, have each risen by 10 yuan, while red sea cucumbers have risen by more than 10 yuan previously.

### Hardware: Local Round Nails Fall to 16 Yuan

Local factory round nails, among all hardware types, can be considered the most common. Because they are widely used, the market price fluctuations are quite significant. This product recently broke through the 16 yuan barrier and returned to 15 yuan 7.5 cents. Yesterday, 500-600 barrels were sold, purchased by merchants and construction crews. According to recent information from the factory, conditions are unusually weak, and they are willing to sell in bulk, so the internal market is quite sluggish. However, there are not many actual transactions, and the market situation is difficult to improve. It is reported that retail sales from local shops also amounted to 50-60 barrels yesterday, but the selling price was around 16 yuan.

### Medicinal Materials: Hangzhou White Chrysanthemum Arrivals Scarce

Hangzhou white chrysanthemum is both a medicinal material and a tea chrysanthemum. Like the green tea we often drink, mixed with chrysanthemum, it has a clear, fragrant, and harmonious flavor, making it a fine product. Therefore, sales are also significant. It is reported that the previous shipment of 60-70 pieces, which were steamed flower buns (each containing one market catty), has already been purchased by tea merchants, at a price of 75 yuan. However, sources are scarce, and external expenses are high, increasing costs. The current market price is 80 yuan, and the demand is quite brisk.

### Silk and Tea: Local Silk Exports; Japanese Merchants Hold Key Position; The Result of Forcible "Organization"; Silk Market Thrives in the Last Half-Month

In late December of last year and the first half of this month, both the export and market price aspects of local silk showed good trends. For example, in terms of exports, each month for the past three months has maintained a record of 4,000 piculs. In terms of market price, each month has also been rising. As of January 15th, it has felt even more firm and prosperous. However, regarding exports, because silk from the Wuxi area has been forcibly controlled, all silk from that region is exclusively exported by Japanese merchants. In recent months, the percentage of the total export volume accounted for by various foreign firms has shifted dramatically. Mitsui, from a very backward position after the war, has used the power of "control" to leap to become the main player in the Shanghai silk export industry, accounting for 20% of the silk export volume among the twenty exporting foreign firms. The silk prices and export volume for the first half of this month are listed below:

White Filature XB13/15: 1460 yuan
White Filature XB16/18: 1260 yuan
White Filature XB20/22: 1300 yuan
Tussah A Grade—: 810 yuan
Tussah GA—: 700 yuan

Silk Shipped to Europe: 542 piculs
Silk Shipped to India: 20 piculs
Silk Shipped to America: 76 piculs

Total: 1423 piculs

### Sugar Market: New Tide Green Offered at Higher Prices

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was slightly tight. The Guild's designated price for No. 24 coarse Dutch white spot goods rose by five cents, trading at 24 yuan 6.5 cents; transit goods rose by 7.5 cents, designated at 16 yuan 7.5 cents; goods from local warehouses were 24 yuan 8.5 cents. Dutch red did not show more strength, with spot goods at 16 yuan 6 cents and transit goods at 11 yuan. Taikoo Crystal White B Mark goods from Western warehouses remained at 23 yuan 9.5 cents. China Sugar Yingang green brand new goods were offered at 13 yuan 8 cents for over a hundred bags. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants offered 313 boxes of sliced green at 11 yuan 8 cents. Jian merchants reported via telegram that top-grade white sugar had recently risen by two yuan, so quoted prices followed suit, but the price increase here has not yet fully passed through, and there are still few deals being made.

### Letter to the Editor: A Statement from a Chinese Employee of a Foreign Bank

To the Editor: Yesterday, I read in your newspaper's "Commercial News" column an article titled "Everyone in the Banking Industry is Making a Fortune," which stated, "Employees of foreign banks have monthly surpluses and foreign exchange to spare, abandoning foreign blessings; in fact, it is still the blessing of the government, so everyone is all smiles." In reality, foreign bank employees are wronged and treated unfairly. Your newspaper's understanding of the situation in foreign banks is inevitably unclear. I specifically request a correction to be provided for public view, so as not to lose sight of the truth. In foreign firms, Western employees do indeed have generous salaries, with ordinary employees generally earning 20,000 yuan annually; there are many items included in this, such as pension funds, car expenses, medical expenses, rental expenses, and foreign exchange subsidies. Among Chinese employees, the highest salaries are only 200 yuan per month, with an end-of-year bonus equal to only one month's salary! They are subjected to unreasonable exploitation by compradores; for example, a certain comprador named Long in a major foreign bank earns a monthly salary of 3,000 yuan and deducts 7,000-8,000 yuan from the salaries of various employees, so his annual income is no less than 100,000 yuan. He enjoys a lavish lifestyle and is attended by six or seven servants. This year, with the pound skyrocketing, he hoarded 3 million yuan in foreign exchange, making a fortune from the national crisis. However, he is stingy by nature and would not contribute a single cent to refugee relief or national crisis donations; he would not even lend money to relatives and friends (omission) Ordinary Chinese employees of foreign banks face a difficult life, toiling like oxen and horses, suffering oppression, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out. How can it be said that they are all smiles? Yours sincerely, Xia Yisheng, January 21st.

Since the publication of the article "Everyone in the Banking Industry is Making a Fortune," we have received many phone calls and letters requesting the newspaper to pay more attention to such news. However, due to space constraints, it is difficult to publish all daily news, and it is impossible to publish everything. The other day, we received a letter from Mr. Xia stating that Chinese employees of foreign banks are not all "all smiles" and that many are toiling like oxen and horses, requesting a correction. It should be published to comply with convention. If there are any new and important letters in the future, please inform us, and we will still select the most important ones for disclosure, to fulfill our duty. - Editor

### Scotto Cup: Lido Wins the Right to Compete; Defeats Larks Six to Two; Leading Two to Zero in the First Half

Yesterday morning was overcast, but the afternoon suddenly cleared up, and the second round of the Scotto Cup finals was successfully concluded. Lido and Larks met at Jiaozhou Park. The field was unusually muddy, and the audience was three times larger than at Yiyuan in the morning. Lido, as a Group C team, surprisingly eliminated the Group A powerhouse Larks by a large score of six to two and won the right to compete in the Scotto Cup semi-finals. Lido led two to zero in the first half. The teams that have now qualified for the semi-finals are Lido, West Post, St. Francis, and East Celle. Good luck to them. There are high hopes for the champion of this Scotto Cup.

Taking the Lead First; Leading by Two Goals

Lido faced the wind and kicked off first. Fafan Xiao made a deep incursion, but Lu Zhongen was quick and kicked the ball out of danger. After that, the situation was completely under Lido's control. Fafan Xiao was closely guarded by Yang Jinling and had no room to move. Seeing Lido's activity, Zhang Lingen occasionally lost his footing, and Mike Deng descended like lightning, shooting near the goal. Everyone thought it was certain to score, but unexpectedly, it went wide. In the 18th minute, Sun Jinshun passed to Jiang Chao, who cut into the center. Li Yichen shot low from the penalty spot into the right corner, opening the scoring. The Larks tried hard to counterattack. Pegge took a free kick outside the penalty area, and Lu Zhongen punched it out. Bo Lining shot hard near the goal, but Lu Zhongen managed to catch it, to everyone's delight. In the 25th minute, Zhang Mingsheng shot, and Atoklas blocked it on the ground, barely touching the ball. Cao Qiuting caught up and kicked it right into the net, making it two to zero. Four minutes later, Meng Yiliang fouled and conceded a penalty. Pegge took the kick, but it flew wide. The Larks' morale was even lower. As the half-time whistle blew, Lido led by two goals.

Tense Situation; Winning Big in the Middle

After the second half, the Larks made major positional changes. Madar was reassigned to left-back, Fafan Xiao filled in at right-wing, Xue Ni Qinggu kicked Ji, and Greenber was reassigned to midfield. Sure enough, they were full of energy. In the 2nd minute, Bo Lining headed the ball, and Fafan Xiao kicked it in, making it two to one. Just as they hoped to improve further, in the 7th minute, Greenber pulled someone down in the penalty area and conceded a penalty. Sun Tie Tui took the kick, but it was saved. Fortunately, Cao Qiuting hooked it in, and before Atoglas could get up, Sun Jinshun had rolled into the net with the ball, making it three to one. Lido was still leading by two goals. The Larks continued their efforts, and in the 16th minute, the Larks finally had a free kick opportunity at the 20-yard mark. Fafan Xiao kicked the ball, which bounced off the goalpost, and Bo Lining added a kick, which was unstoppable, making it three to two. The score was close. Li Yichen was also injured and unable to walk well, making the situation quite precarious. Holding on until the 34th minute, Zhang Mingsheng passed to Shi Yongnan, who crossed it to the center. Li Yichen shot low at the 10-yard mark, making it four to two and stabilizing the situation. Five minutes later, Li Yichen deliberately lost his footing, and Jiang Chao poked the ball in, breaking the enemy's goal again, making it five to two. Victory was assured. In the last minute, Cao Qiuting crossed, and Zhang Mingsheng darted in and shot low, making it six to two and adding to the victory. The final whistle blew, and the Larks were miserably eliminated, while Lido won the right to compete in the semi-finals.

### Poor Luck; Good Opportunities Become a Painted Cake; Donghua Suffers a Miserable Defeat Yesterday; Lost Two to Four to East Celle; The Scotto Cup Must Wait Until Next Year

Yesterday morning, the drizzle was like silk. The second week of the East China and East Celle Scotto Cup game at Yiyuan was still held as usual. Only three to four hundred spectators came, and Donghua's luck was as bleak as the weather. Under the double pressure of the muddy field and heavy ball, they were miserably eliminated by the British army by two to four. Losing three goals in the first half was a fatal blow.

Losing Three Goals in a Row; Morale Plummets

At the center line kick-off, in the 5th minute, Pan JieTuo kicked a high ball directly under the goal. Zhou Dayun slapped it out with both hands, and Mike Luo Dui slanted over and put it in, Donghua losing a city first. So, the three armies used their lives, and they fought hard to counterattack. Dai Wanwu went straight to the front line, and A Dai took the opportunity to pass to the left. A Wan shot, but it flew over the crossbar, making it feel a pity. From then on, the British army was very rampant. In the 15th minute, Mike Luo Tuo raised his foot and was shut out, but Da Yun blocked it with his foot, but he gave a spear to others, and Bao Duoke's man arrived, and the foot arrived. The door was opened again, two to zero. Dai Wanwu triangulated and counterattacked the enemy's nest. A Dai headed, Bing Hao went forward, Hess was slippery and fell to the ground, but it was a miss again, and the ball was not flowing. Bing Hao pulled and shot, but it hit the right wood. Before long, Youliang kicked out a corner kick, and A Dai headed, but it was high above the plane. After that, Youliang passed the two passes of Austin and Hailiesun and transported to the center. The British army had no reinforcements in front and was empty behind, but Dai Wu lost his footing with each other and became a cake again. So, in the 36th minute, Flatai attacked Da Yun's right corner at the 20-yard mark. It was low and urgent. In the first half, the British army took an absolute advantage with a score of three to zero.

Bad Luck; One is like this

After the second half, Donghua greatly adjusted its position, Zhuang Zhao changed places, and Xu Cai also changed places. The situation suddenly improved. Although they encountered a dangerous situation in the first minute, the offensive was quite strong after that. A Dai first performed a long shot at the 24-yard mark. The ball was flat and urgent, and the shot was too accurate. It went straight into Hess's arms. Before long, the ball progressed from the right, Hailiesun lost his footing, and the gate was wide open. Dai Shen went straight down shoulder to shoulder, but his father's shot was one foot off. It was even more regrettable that when Youliang passed a foot, Shen Tuyan rushed to catch up, and he hooked the money at the bottom. The ball swept across the door, and A Dai Bing Hao rushed in on both sides. The people entered the net, but the ball rolled out of bounds. Hui hit it, almost turning against each other, but it became a corner kick, and the battle was fought again. The British army was quite exhausted. The front line was only Heil who launched a long shot at the 25-yard mark, which hit the post and bounced back. The rear was still in a state of panic. Hess held the ball and walked four steps, and was fined for picking up the fence. It was only two yards away from the door, and the result was that they all fell to the ground, but the ball did not enter. It had a great rugby flavor. Under this general attack by Donghua, in the 29th minute, Youliang cut into the center, and Bing Hao headed the ball to A Dai, who hit it at the 14-yard mark, tying the score to one to three. Xianghua changed positions with Bing Hao, and in the 43rd minute, Shiyan passed to Jia, Jia passed to Wan, and A Wan passed it back to Cheng Dong, and sent it to the front of the door. Shen Shiyan poked it in, two to three, and they were only one goal behind. Unfortunately, there were only two minutes left until the end, and Flatai suddenly shot from the 18-yard mark, and Da Yun did not catch it with his eyes. Dong's good dream was not realized, and he was miserably eliminated from the second week of the Cup with a score of two to four.

### Pudong Guerrilla Area; Restoring County Elementary Schools; Counting Fengnan and Chuan Three Counties

Education in the Pudong guerrilla area has been stagnated for a long time since the war. Except for the few puppet "Dadao Elementary Schools" along the Pudong coast, which rely on the power of the Japanese army to protect them and implement a kind of enslaved education to repay their masters, the county elementary schools in the vast area controlled by the Hua Fang guerrilla team have not been restored. It is now heard that the Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that it is inappropriate to waste the children's studies for a long time. In the blink of an eye, the second semester of the 27th year will begin again, and it is necessary to take this opportunity to restore them separately. The heads of Fengnan and Chuan Three Counties have been instructed to prepare for the opening of county elementary schools as soon as possible within the possible range, and to take in free students as the principle, and not to charge any tuition or book fees. Yu Taosheng, the head of Nanhui County, has ordered that a part of the salt tax be allocated as educational expenses for the next semester, and the original county schools will be opened. However, the salaries of teachers and staff are extremely meager, with the principal receiving 15 yuan and the teachers receiving 14 yuan, in order to comply with the principle of reducing government expenses during the war of resistance. Personnel will also be sent to Shanghai to purchase a large number of textbooks.

School Overview

### Xin Bei Middle School

Xin Bei Middle School in this city is a reorganized version of the former Municipal Shi Bei Middle School. The original Municipal Shi Bei Middle School was located in Zhabei, with extensive school buildings and a student body of seven to eight hundred, making it one of the city's famous municipal middle schools. After the August 13th incident, the school buildings were located in the war zone, so it was moved to the concession to resume classes. Later, it was reorganized under orders and renamed Xin Bei Middle School. A school board was established, with Guo Mingjiu from the banking industry serving as Chairman and Dr. Lu Xirong and others serving as school board members. Xu Zexiang (Father Pei), the former supervisor of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, succeeded as principal, and classes continued at 183 Nanyang Road. It was registered with the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs and filed with the Ministry of Education. During the summer vacation, the school moved to a foreign-style house at 18, Alley 11, Jiaozhou Road, as its school building, with a central location. The total number of high school, junior high school, and kindergarten teacher training students reached 264, divided into seven classes: three high school classes, three junior high school classes, and one kindergarten teacher training class. This has been specially filed with the Ministry of Education. The school's teaching and management have always been extremely strict, and diligence has been emphasized recently. In terms of moral education, the school follows the Ministry's orders to implement a tutor system, establishing various daily life rules to ensure that students strictly adhere to them. Tutors examine the students' situation daily and provide guidance as needed. In addition, extracurricular activities and social services are actively pursued.

### "Enemy Horses"

— Cao Juren

——New Impressions from a Wartime Journey——

A gentleman came here and asked me, "When the enemy's horses are captured by our army, do they lower their heads to express shame and repentance?" I was very ashamed, not only had I never seen it, I had never even heard of it. I showed him many photos of our generals riding captured enemy horses, their heads held high, as if they had no remorse at all. However, it would be quite interesting to find an enemy horse that came from the battlefield and was determined to become a monk, but unfortunately, we don't have the good fortune to see that.

Since the gentleman brought up the topic of enemy horses, many friends who lived on the battlefield spoke of their own experiences. "In a village near Lanling, a squadron of enemy cavalry was surrounded by our army. By the third day, it was clear that there was no hope of breaking through the strong iron ring. On the fourth morning, an enemy plane flew low over the village and dropped a signal. An hour after the plane flew back, there was a burst of intermittent gunfire in the village, followed by silence. Soon after, our army broke into the village, finding more than a dozen enemy soldiers and more than fifty enemy horses. Some of the horses had only one ear left, and others had only one eye left, standing there dripping with blood. Some of them truly became one-eyed dragons, and they are still pulling carts in our herd. The enemy's horses look very good, plump and with shiny coats."

The Chief of Staff's recollection of what he saw in southern Shandong sparked a new topic from the military commander, who said, "The enemy's horses are too beautiful to be useful. The horses sent to us by the 106th Division were enough to form a cavalry squadron. Among them, there were a dozen or so that were extremely beautiful. It is said that they were a precious breed of horse, and even their feed had to be brought from their own country. We couldn't afford to raise these young master horses, and we couldn't even lift them, so we had to let them starve to death there." The gentleman laughed and said, "The enemy's artists might be able to paint a picture of righteous horses, saying that those young master horses were captured but unyielding, and starved themselves to death." After a burst of laughter, I supplemented what the enemies themselves criticized about their horses in "Unkilled Soldiers." They said, "The Chinese mules and horses look like ghosts, thin and small, dragging one step after another. When it comes to long distances, especially on muddy and rugged roads, our top-notch horses are far inferior to those ghostly mules and horses, enduring hardship and walking steadily without collapsing." This is a general explanation of the fate of the Sino-Japanese war. The enemy's horses symbolize the enemy's fighting power.

When the staff officer was fighting in Lanfeng, he spent more than ten days in the cavalry column commanded by the notorious wandering Doihara, and he intercepted many horses one after another. The horse he rode and the horse the military commander rode were both taken from that time. His "enemy horse theory" is also quite interesting. He said, "The owner's personality is often expressed in the objects he loves. Young ladies like Pekingese dogs, and big thieves want to have a ferocious wolf-like dog. These are all reflections of the owner's personality. The enemy has a common idea about horses: these are 'military' horses, they must be fat and shiny, and they don't pay much attention to whether they are strong inside. We usually treat the enemy's horses as decorations. But when we go to the battlefield, I will choose a different one." Using the form of horses to portray the mentality of the nouveau riche is very profound and meaningful.

On the Japanese side, there may have been people who saw this point. Wasn't Takahashi, the finance minister who was sacrificed in the February 26th incident, talking about the emptiness of their own economic foundation?

### Daladier: "Only My Share Remains"

— Dai Cangqi

### Repentance

— Lu Ming

In the middle of the night, I was awakened by the sound of rain outside the window, and I remembered Min. Min was driven out of here by me this evening.

Min is my friend, and also a friend of my roommates Shi and Ying. We three lived in a small room of less than five feet on each side, which was already cramped, and Min insisted on living here as well. At first, he only said three or four days and would leave immediately, and we reluctantly agreed out of consideration for our friendship. Although we three were living in a precarious situation, and the income from our labor was only enough to barely survive, Min was even worse off than us: he had a hand that could not work. At this time, he had to share a bowl of soup from his poor friends.

"Misery loves company," this "love" comes from emotion. Giving because of compassion is also slight and temporary. It was naturally impossible for Min to ask us to tighten our belts and support him for a long time!

Several times we explained our difficulties to him in a gentle manner. The room was small and our strength was weak, and we hoped that he would quickly find another way, but he always seemed to forget after listening. Day after day passed, and gradually we began to have hatred and annoyance for him.

A month passed and then another month, and now it was almost two months. We spent all our money on things that went into our stomachs, our rent was two months in arrears, and we thought that all these pains were Min's fault alone. If it weren't for him, we wouldn't be like this! So, tonight, we all got angry:

"Drive Min away!"

When Min came back from fetching water to prepare dinner, I spoke first according to the resolution we had just made:

"Min, there's no need to cook dinner. You have to leave here quickly!"

These sudden, serious, and resolute words shocked Min. He stared at me in astonishment, unable to say a word. "Leave quickly!" I ordered again, "If you stay any longer, you'll not only harm us by not having anything to eat, but we won't even have a place to live! Do you understand? If you understand, leave here quickly!"

He burst into tears, looking as pitiful as a lost lamb! But this not only did not arouse my pity, but ignited my anger! I shouted loudly:

"Get out! You unlucky wretch!"

As I said that, I stood up and pushed him out the door. While struggling, he cried out in a trembling voice with tears in his eyes, "Where do you want me to go! Where do you want me to go!" "Go to your rich friends!..." I answered him with gritted teeth.

"I, I don't have... rich friends! The rich ones used to be my friends! Now, now they are willing to take me in! Poor friends who don't have money still value friendship and mix together..."

"Hmph! How can poor friends afford to entertain you, they will be exhausted themselves! Get out, you must get out..."

I pushed him out of the door. At this moment, he struggled like crazy, shouting: "Yun, Yun, think of the old days, I won't eat your food, let, let me occupy a bed in the corner..."

"Bang!" I closed the door and pretended not to hear or see him crying and shouting outside, hitting the door with his fists.

Min's cries gradually became hoarse and weak, and fell silent at some point.

But at this moment, God started to rain, and it was a heavy rain! I was awakened, and I couldn't help but remember Min! Min was driven away by me, and I was the one who made him sleep in the rain! It's my sin! I regret it!

I got out of bed and put on my clothes. The cold air of the winter midnight made me tremble! I lit the kerosene lamp, and the flickering flames drove away the darkness in the room! I listened intently, "Tick-tock of crickets," as if it was Min's vengeful cry to me. When I looked at the glass window on the wall, the raindrops were like arrows, shooting straight at the heart of the enemy! Without hesitation, I grabbed the lamp in one hand and opened the door of the room and the door of the house. I wanted to let Min walk into our warm little room. I am willing to kneel on the ground and ask him to punish me!

The cold rain hit my head, face, hands, and there was no sign of Min?

Min, Min! Where are you hiding under someone else's eaves, becoming a drowned rat, or have you stiffened in the thunderstorm?

Min! Your friend Yun deeply repents! The room is small, but it can still accommodate you, and we will die together if we starve! Come back, come back, come back to your poor friend's home, and let's fight and struggle together...

### The Mission of Eyes

— Yang Yanqi

Writing articles: use your brain, use your hands, and also use your eyes.

Things written without eyes can only be written and read by yourself, and no one will want them. The structure of the article is good, and the words and sentences are beautiful and powerful, but it is full of empty words. There is no benefit to be gained from reading it, and it is more beneficial to close your eyes and sleep. Study Chinese? Who has the time to ponder and learn?

Society is multifaceted, and the phenomena of the human world are also unfathomable. You see some things, and I see some things. You experience some things, and I experience some things. What you see or experience may not be what I see or experience. We have the materials to describe our own understanding, knowledge, and even understanding of feelings. Think with your brain and write with your hands, but first you have to look with your eyes.

And how do you look? Sometimes the trivial matters around us and the surrounding situations cannot satisfy the needs of our pens. We feel that life is too ordinary, there is no material to write about, and there is no life record worthy of publication. Therefore, some people shout, "Material shortage!" Although some people instruct us, and some people tell us that there will never be an end to writing materials, and some people teach us how to use small raw materials and how to discover writing materials, there are still people shouting, "Material shortage!" It seems that the materials that can be written have been used up by others.

In fact, as long as you know how to look, you can create infinite good articles. Especially in today's epic era, you can find a lot of wonderful materials in every corner. After the tempering of thought and the rendering of the pen, you can complete the great mission of a literary man. However, it is easy to say, but difficult to do. Everyone is ambitious but unskilled, able to talk but not able to do. This is a fact, I don't deny it. However, I don't believe in the miracle of dreams blossoming and the strange genius who can write on horseback. One thing, one person, or a group of people, a group of things, should all be seen with your own eyes. After seeing it, you can't just scribble on paper. You have to use your brain to digest the feelings of your own eyes, and chew carefully from your own subjective position. When you can distinguish the taste, and then put effort into the pen, you have hope of achieving great success.

There are many literary swindlers in the literary world who use their half-understood things to promote themselves. As a result, they may deceive reputation, deceive status, and even deceive money. But in fact, at most they are just clever swindlers. Once exposed, they are even less valuable, and everyone will laugh silently.

We have eyes, eyes that can see things. We should use them well, live up to their mission, and let them help us solve the current major problem of "material shortage".

### Shao Bao Hu's War Merits in Pacifying the Japanese Pirates

— Zou Xiao

——Talk on National Novels

The last volume of Zhou Qingyuan's "Second Collection of West Lake" in the Ming Dynasty, namely Volume 34, is "Shao Bao Hu's War Merits in Pacifying the Japanese Pirates", and the "Important Coastal Defense" method is attached to the end. Is there a profound meaning in it? Why should I use the story of pacifying the Japanese pirates as the final chapter, and repeatedly tell readers the method of preventing the Japanese pirates?

Most of this short story is based on Mao Kun's "Complete Account of Suppressing and Eliminating Xu Hai" in the Ming Dynasty. In many places, it is only a change from classical Chinese to vernacular, with a little description added.

Among them, there is a section about the story of Wang Cuicao, which describes how a prostitute induces Xu Hai to surrender and kills Xu Hai, which is very moving. Her behavior is similar to that of the Fei palace maids in the late Ming Dynasty. Kunqu Opera "Assassinating the Tiger" is a famous drama often performed on stage, and Wang Cuicao should also be an excellent theatrical material.

Regarding Wang Cuicao, the anonymous "General Record of Pacifying the Japanese Pirates in the Southeast during the Jiajing Period" in the Ming Dynasty hardly mentioned it, and Zhu Jiude's "Brief History of the Japanese Change" in the Ming Dynasty only had these few sentences: "On the 19th day of the eighth month of the Jiajing 35th year, Hai knew that danger was imminent, and at the second watch of the night, he sent close guards to escort the two beloved concubines out of the nest to escape." The so-called two beloved concubines are Wang Cuicao and Lv Shu.

Wang Cuicao's ability is as follows: "Wang Cuicao was a prostitute from Linzi. When the Japanese pirates invaded Jiangnan, they plundered Cuicao. Xu Hai, the leader of the stronghold, loved her very much and respected her as his wife. All plans were made by Cuicao's instructions. Cuicao also pretended to agree, but secretly hoped for his failure. At that time, the Governor's Office sent Hua Laoren to persuade Hai to surrender. Hai was about to kill him, but Cuicao untied his bonds and gave him gold. He returned to tell the Governor's Office, and then sent Luo Zhongjun to persuade Hai, and increased the gold, jewels, and jade to secretly bribe Cuicao. Cuicao calmly said in the tent every day that great things must not be accomplished, it is better to surrender. Hai decided. The Governor's Office reorganized the army and pretended to surrender: They forced Hai's stronghold, Hai believed Cuicao's words and was not prepared. The officers and soldiers broke in suddenly and beheaded Hai. Cuicao was captured alive, and the Japanese pirates were annihilated. The Governor's Office gave Cuicao to the chieftain of Yongshun. Cuicao left and crossed the Qiantang River, sighing: "Ming Shan treated me well, and I lured and killed him for the sake of the country: killing one chieftain belongs to another chieftain, what face do I have to live?" She jumped into the river and died in the middle of the night." (Excerpt from Mao Kun's "Complete Account of Suppressing and Eliminating Xu Hai")

Ouyang Yuqian wants to adapt this matter into a new Peking opera. With his skills in writing "Liang Hongyu", writing Wang Cuicao's departure from Yema Chen Dong will surely have some witty remarks. However, in the original story, "Bribing Cuicao secretly with gold, jewels, and jade" (Ji Zhuqing's "History of Sino-Japanese Wars of All Ages" also said: "Several spies were sent to hold hairpins and earrings to leave two servants of Hai, and they persuaded Hai day and night.") inevitably lowered Wang Cuicao's status and aspirations. According to the context, since Wang Cuicao "pretended to agree, but secretly hoped for his failure" before, and then said "I lured and killed him for the sake of the country," it can be seen that her will had been decided long before she was bribed, and she made it clear that it was for the sake of the country, not because she was moved by gold, jewels, and jade. I hope that when Yuqian writes this drama in the future, he can emphasize that Wang Cuicao killed Xu Hai for the sake of the country.

Xu Hai was originally a Chinese, helping the tyrant to abuse others. This reminds us of the fishermen of Shidongkou in our country during the August 13th Shanghai battle, who led the enemy deep into the country, resulting in the loss of Luodian. Southern Jiangsu also lost the area around Suzhou, Wuxi, and Jiangyin quickly because the fishermen became traitors. Proving the past with the present is exactly the same. Since Yuqian has vividly portrayed Wang Zhi in "Liang Hongyu", then a big traitor like Xu Hai will surely be able to give us a "caricature".

### Relieving Beggar Children

— Qin

Recently, beggar children can be seen everywhere in Shanghai.

Some beggar children chase pedestrians on the side of the road to ask for money. Some beggar children sit on the ground and ask passers-by for money. Some beggar children ask for money from people waiting for buses and streetcars at the bus stops and streetcar stations. Some beggar children pick up vegetable peels and meat bones around the vegetable market. If the vegetable sellers or buyers are not careful, these beggar children will also do "shoplifting", stealing some vegetables and hiding them in their broken baskets.

Some beggar children rummage through barren land or trash cans for broken things, such as coal cinders, firewood, paper scraps, cloth scraps, cigarette cans, broken bottles, broken glass, etc. They pick up all the waste discarded by others and send it to secondhand stores in exchange for a few copper coins.

Why are there so many beggar children in Shanghai? There are two main categories: One category is refugees who have fled from the mainland to Shanghai, unable to make a living, so they force their children to beg with them. These beggar children help their parents to maintain their family life together. Another category is taught the skills of begging by "old men" (old beggars), and they ask passers-by for money. The money they beg is handed over to the old man. The old man specializes in doing the work of pouring out food buckets, pouring out the leftovers from restaurants and dividing them among his "disciples" (beggar children) to eat. At night, the old man takes care of his disciples to sleep in dirty alleys. These beggar children are helping the old beggars to ask for money. If they don't ask for money, they often get beaten, and sometimes they are beaten into cripples!

These beggar children are simply worse than slaves! It is said that there are one or two thousand beggar children in Shanghai. Their only way out is either starvation or banditry. From a humanitarian perspective or from a social perspective, we should urgently provide relief to beggar children, give them education and food.

The relief method is nothing more than setting up beggar children's education and training homes: the following is a simple method,

1.  Site: Choose a place close to poor residents, build dozens of shacks, and force all the beggar children in the city to live inside. In addition to providing food and clothing, give them moral education and give them considerable knowledge and skills to make a living.

2.  Funding: Assuming that there are 2,000 beggar children, excluding start-up costs, the monthly recurring cost is about 10,000 yuan. There is no shortage of kind-hearted compatriots in Shanghai, and I think this small amount is not difficult to raise.

Beggar children are also the future masters of the country. We provide relief to beggar children, which is also improving society and revitalizing the country. I hope that all compatriots in the city will rise up and organize to promote its realization.

Folk Tales

### Master Wang the Fourth

— Fengwu

It is said that at the end of the Ming Dynasty, roving bandits were a scourge. Li Zicheng's forces captured Beijing, and Emperor Chongzhen hanged himself on Coal Hill. Wu Sangui, the general guarding the Shanhaiguan Pass, was so enraged by Li Zicheng's seizure of his beloved concubine Chen Yuanyuan that he disregarded the consequences and allowed the Manchus to enter the pass. As a result, he let the wolf into the house, and the beautiful land was occupied by a foreign race. Dorgon entered the pass and within forty days welcomed Shunzhi to take the throne in Beijing, while simultaneously dispatching troops south. At that time, officials, both high and low, either fled or surrendered. A group of shameless Han traitors even addressed the invaders as emperors and recognized the enemy as their fathers. However, there were also many who remained unyielding. The most prominent were Shi Kefa, who vowed to perish with Yangzhou, and Yan, the registrar of Jiangyin, who steadfastly defended the isolated city. Their heroic deeds are worthy of being passed down through the ages.

After the Qing troops successively captured Yangzhou and Jiangyin, they marched mightily towards Zhejiang, advancing like a hot knife through butter and easily conquering Pinghu County. They then appointed a petty clown to take the stage and play the role of Pinghu County Magistrate. On the day the magistrate took office, he made a grand display of his authority as he paraded through the streets. However, the people's spirit was not dead, and everyone gnashed their teeth at the sight of his grotesque appearance, wishing they could swallow him whole. At this time, a blacksmith named Li, who was working at his forge, was so angered by the sight of this fox exploiting the tiger's authority that his eyes bulged, and he instinctively picked up a large pair of scissors and hurled them with all his might at the magistrate. Because Li the blacksmith worked with metal, his eyesight was usually accurate, and this throw was also done with all of his lifelong strength, hitting the magistrate squarely in the head. Brains flowed out, and he died on the spot. The yamen runners who were clearing the way scattered in all directions upon seeing their master dead. After the news spread, the death of a petty Han traitor was not a big deal in itself, but when it reached the ears of a Qing general, it was a disaster! He had appointed the official, and not only had the local people failed to welcome him diligently, but they had even killed him. This was intolerable! The people of Pinghu also knew that they had committed a great crime, and on the one hand, they quickly elected several gentlemen to gather a group of young men to strengthen the defenses and prepare to resist. On the other hand, they dispatched scouts to report on the movements of the Qing troops at all times. However, everyone had already heard of the massacres of "Ten Days of Yangzhou" and "Three Massacres of Jiading," and they felt as if a great disaster was about to befall them, constantly worrying about the danger of a city-wide massacre, hiding in their homes and afraid to go out.

However, the reality was somewhat unbelievable. Several days passed, but there was no movement from the Qing troops. The people of Pinghu assumed that nothing would happen, withdrew the scouts, and gradually relaxed the city defenses, leaving only a small group of local braves at the West Gate. The streets also returned to their original bustle, and the fear of a massacre gradually faded. But were the Qing troops really willing to let it go? When they were conquering the Han people and ruling China, any resistance to them was naturally considered a challenge to their authority, and they wanted to severely punish the people of Pinghu. This punishment was none other than indiscriminate slaughter. Therefore, while the main force of the Qing troops continued to move south, a small detachment was dispatched back to Pinghu. At first, the Qing troops saw that the city was prepared, so they remained inactive, waiting until the defenses of Pinghu were relaxed. Then, on a morning when the stars were sparse and the east was just beginning to lighten, they secretly ambushed outside the East Gate, waiting for the city gate to open so they could rush in and have a good slaughter. The poor people of Pinghu were still dreaming, unaware of the cruel massacre that would occur when the red sun rose in the east. At this time, near the city gate, in a small noodle shop, a man named Wang Si, known as Master Wang the Fourth, heard a vague and noisy sound of people outside the city and knew that something was wrong. Wang Si, despite earning his living by selling noodles, was unusually tall and strong. His arms were as thick as bronze pillars, and he possessed great strength. He was also very kind and insightful. Ever since Li the blacksmith killed the magistrate, he had known that the Qing troops would come one day. On this day, he had just gotten up when he heard the commotion outside the city. He had already guessed what was happening and thought to himself that, with his strength, he could at least hold out for a few hours and prevent the Qing troops from entering. Having made up his mind, he grabbed a large dough-cutting knife, weighing fifty or sixty pounds, from the shop, bared his chest, gritted his teeth, and hid behind the city gate, waiting for the Qing troops to rush in so that he could give them a taste of his power. His tall figure looked like a fierce gate guardian.

The chickens in the distance began to crow, and the sky slowly brightened. The vendors rushing to the early market gathered in greater numbers, and the people buying vegetables jostled in the crowd. The shops opened their doors one after another, and the atmosphere was as lively as usual.

But at this moment, Wang Si opened one side of the city gate and raised his large knife high. The Qing troops saw that the city gate was open and rushed in. Suddenly, with a loud crash, the ruthless blade flashed, and a bloody head rolled to the ground. The Qing soldier in the lead became the first victim of Wang Si's knife. Those who followed naturally met the same fate, and corpses lay scattered across the ground. Fresh red blood flowed like a spring towards the lower ground. Wang Si became more and more excited as he killed, and he became stronger and stronger.

At this time, the whole city knew that the Qing troops had arrived at the East Gate and that Wang Si was resisting them alone. Some took their elders and children out of the West and North Gates and fled to the nearby countryside. Some closed their doors and hid in their homes. Even the local braves who had been gathered had run away. The lively streets were now desolate, and the city had become a dead city. Only outside the East Gate, the shouts of the Qing troops were deafening. Wang Si still guarded the gate, his body covered in blood, holding out against the Qing troops for a full two hours. He truly embodied the saying, "One man guards the pass, and ten thousand cannot enter."

But a person's strength is ultimately limited. Eventually, he became exhausted and was overwhelmed by the Qing troops. Wang Si was turned into mincemeat under the long spears and knives of the Qing soldiers. However, the people of Pinghu were able to escape because Wang Si had intercepted the Qing troops at the city gate. This was truly a gift from Wang Si.

During the Qing Dynasty, due to the oppressive power of the foreign race, people did not dare to record this event. This story was only passed down through the mouths of the elderly. The ruins of Wang Si still remain at the East Gate of Pinghu, and many people go there to worship him every year. Several years ago, the local gentry of Pinghu wanted to build a temple to commemorate him, but they did not succeed because the war of resistance had begun. However, the great deeds of Wang Si will be forever remembered.

### Lao Laizi

— Fengjiang

Lao Laizi was a native of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period. He was a filial son, and his filial piety towards his parents could be said to be meticulous. When he was seventy years old, his parents were still alive, and in order to make them happy, he forgot that he was an old man and dressed like a child in colorful clothes, holding a baby's rattle and rolling on the ground to play children's games to make his parents happy. This touching story of filial piety has been passed down to this day and is still praised by people.

Lao Laizi was indeed a virtuous man, but his wife was even more insightful and virtuous. This virtuous woman is considered an exemplary virtuous wife, so her name is also listed in the Biographies of Virtuous Women. She once advised her husband not to change his ambitions. Lao Laizi was originally a farmer, and he farmed on the south side of Mount Meng. Once, the King of Chu passed through this place and knew that Lao Laizi was a virtuous man, so he went to find him. The King of Chu said to Lao Laizi, "You are working very hard in the fields, and it is too bitter. I want you to change your ambitions and come to our court to be a high official." Lao Laizi was somewhat tempted and agreed to serve as an official for the King of Chu. After the King of Chu left, Lao Laizi's wife strongly disagreed and said to her husband, "I have heard that those who can give you wine and meat without conditions can also give you lashes without conditions. Those who can give you high office without conditions can also give you the punishment of the axe without conditions. You are willing to change your ambitions to be a high official, but I am not willing to be controlled by others and change my ambitions to go with you." Then she left without regard for him. Lao Laizi had no choice but to give up his ambition to become an official and followed his wife. His wife said to him, "Although we are poor, we can weave the feathers of birds and beasts to keep warm, and we can gather the grains left by birds and beasts to fill our stomachs. Why change our ambitions to seek glory for the sake of a small salary?" Lao Laizi then did not change his original intention, and later generations passed it down as a beautiful story. As the saying goes, "Do not change your principles because of poverty, and do not change your ambition because of meanness." Only then can you be a great man. Those who change their ambitions to seek glory must be pleased with Lao Laizi's wife.

If I see one less play, the refugees can avoid cold and hunger.

### The Hero of Dongguan "Yuan Chonghuan" (II)

— Lanxin

When Sancunying was not defended and Zunhua also fell, the Manchu troops drove straight in and successively conquered Jizhou, Shunyi, and other counties. At this time, Chonghuan had no choice but to send troops to meet the enemy, so he stationed troops outside the city of Shahe, facing the Manchu troops from afar.

He predicted that the Manchu troops would launch a night attack, so he had already set up a defense in the camp. As expected, the Manchu troops came to raid the camp that night, but they did not know that he was prepared, and the Manchu troops were killed, scattered, and fled in all directions, holding their heads and scurrying away.

On the other hand, Chonghuan anticipated that the Manchu troops had come from afar and would benefit from a quick battle but could not last. Therefore, he used the method of "protracted war" to deal with the Manchu troops. His methods were: 1. Strengthen the walls and clear the fields, so that all manpower and materials would not be used by the Manchu troops; 2. Use a small number of troops to deal with the Manchu troops, while preserving the main force for future use; 3. If there were any losses, they would be recovered, like a seesaw, so that the power of the Manchu troops could not develop. Indeed, his military strategies were quite effective.

However, a protracted war requires a protracted political situation to support it. In particular, internal will must be unified, otherwise the enemy will take the opportunity to exploit it, because when the enemy suffers military setbacks, they are accustomed to using insidious methods of discord to replace their dying struggle. Sure enough, the Manchus used a counter-espionage plot, forging two documents and having them dropped outside the Yongding Gate in Beijing. By chance, someone picked them up and took them to see Emperor Huai. Emperor Huai originally believed in Chonghuan, but now someone said that Chonghuan was not resisting, and the letters were full of private words of reconciliation that violated the country. When Emperor Huai saw this, he was furious and said, "That's outrageous! No wonder Chonghuan is standing still. So that's what's going on!" He immediately ordered Chonghuan to be recalled, beheaded, and displayed to the public.

Chonghuan was dead. His wife and brothers were exiled three thousand miles away. This was not enough, and Emperor Huai also ordered the confiscation of his property. Later, several old wooden utensils and a box of coarse cloth clothes were found in his home, and nothing else. At this point, Emperor Huai realized that Chonghuan was an honest official and that there must have been a misunderstanding about the matter of seeking peace.

When the truth came to light and the Manchu troops entered the Central Plains, Emperor Huai was very regretful! Alas! Chonghuan died. Since this loyal, brave, and patriotic minister was killed, the Ming Dynasty's empire was in danger. (The End)

### A Way Out for Our Fellow Refugees in the Future

— Sun Xuexiao

Participate in Production Work

"The refugee shelter is not sheltering refugees now; it's simply sheltering a group of lazy people!" This is an angry statement from some of the people involved in refugee work and some social figures familiar with the situation in the shelters. Of course, this statement is a bit of an exaggeration, and the fellow refugees will definitely have a negative reaction when they hear it. But if we think about it carefully, it's not without reason. Indeed, for more than a year, the number of people in society seeking maids, nannies, apprentices, and odd-jobbers from the shelters has been dozens every month. However, the number of applicants is as rare as morning stars; even if they apply, they become discouraged after a few days and return to the shelters. The shelter authorities, adhering to the purpose of education, have established various small workshops in the shelters, recruiting fellow refugees to participate in production work. In the end, there is the same situation of work available but no one to do it, so that the workshop authorities cannot maintain them and have to close them. According to the investigation of ordinary people, the reason why the fellow refugees are not happy to participate in production work is that they dislike the low wages and the hard work, which is one reason, but the main reason is that they rely on the shelters for food and lodging, and they don't have to worry about freezing and starving if they don't work.

I think, if this statement hits the heart of the average fellow refugee, then the future of these fellow refugees will definitely encounter great danger! Why do I say this?

As everyone knows, the supplies for the shelters are donated by charitable people at home and abroad. But charitable people are not gods of wealth, and the supply of the shelters cannot come from a constant source. In other words, the shelters are in danger of being dissolved at any time. Therefore, if we don't find a job to do in advance, the fellow refugees will definitely face freezing and starvation as soon as the shelters are dissolved.

To take a step back, even if the supplies for the shelters are constantly provided by the efforts of charitable people at home and abroad until the war is over, if we don't find a job to do in advance and prepare to earn some money and exercise our bodies, even if you can return to your hometown happily, you will not be able to rebuild the families destroyed by the artillery fire because you have been wandering around empty-handed and have become lazy! No, at least in the initial stage of rebuilding your family, you will encounter considerable difficulties.

Moreover, our country's policy is a long-term war of resistance. The so-called long-term war of resistance is an indefinite war of resistance, lasting at least two or three years, or as long as eight or ten years, or even several decades. Can our shelters exist indefinitely? I think, as the war continues day by day, the social economy will inevitably become more and more difficult. Then the difficulty of providing supplies for the shelters will inevitably become more and more serious, until it is impossible to maintain them in the middle. At that time, we fellow refugees who have not found work and saved some money in advance will not be able to return to our hometowns or stay in our host towns. What will we do?

Based on the above reasons, I believe that as fellow refugees, as long as they are adults, regardless of men and women, as long as they are not working for the other side, regardless of Chinese and foreigners, they should find a job to earn money and exercise their soon-to-be lazy bodies. Never dislike a job because it is too hard or the wages are too low, and never quit a job that you have already taken. In particular, you should pay attention to the fact that the money you earn is blood money, which is to be used as capital for rebuilding your family when the country is recovered and you return to your hometown. Don't waste it, and save as much as possible.

Perhaps, some people will ask, where can I find a job on this isolated island where there is little porridge and many monks? Who will give me work to do? I think, considering the number of production enterprises established by various shelters in the past and the planned implementation of the well-intentioned administrative authorities to strengthen production enterprises in the future, as long as you are willing to work hard, it will not be a big problem. Moreover, social figures always have sympathy. As long as they know that you are a refugee who wants to work, even if they don't give you work right away, they will give you priority when there is an opportunity! If this is also impossible, then you may wish to find some funds to run a small business. Fortunately, you have food and lodging, even if you don't earn a penny, you only spend some energy! But this shouldn't be the case, right? Otherwise, how can the small producers in the shelters maintain their personal food and lodging or even the food and lodging of their families every day?

Finally, I sincerely hope to all fellow refugees:

The only and safe way for fellow refugees to survive this unprecedented and protracted national crisis is to participate in production work. Therefore, every fellow refugee should "have a job if they are unemployed, and enjoy their work if they are employed." At the same time, every fellow refugee should understand that "saving a penny now can help you more when you leave the shelter and return to your hometown!"

### Saving People and Killing People

— Reporter for the Refugees

Yu the Great, who controlled the floods, thought that if there were people drowning in the world, it was as if he had drowned them.

Hou Ji, who managed the food supply, thought that if there were people starving to death in the world, it was as if he had starved them to death.

I think: If people who have the ability cannot contribute money and effort to save the displaced compatriots, and cause them to starve and freeze to death, then those displaced compatriots who starve and freeze to death are being killed alive by the people who have the ability. Failure to save people is killing people!

(Below) After the dictation was over, the teacher looked at us calmly and said in a kind voice, "Everyone, listen to me. We will be together for a year from now on. Let's have a good year together. Everyone should work hard and be disciplined. I don't have any family members; you are my family members. Besides you, there is no one else in the world that I love. You are my sons. I love you.

### Weekly War Report

In the past week, the war situation in various places has shown signs of activity. Whether it is in Guangdong and Hunan-Hubei, as well as the Jinbei area, there has been considerable contact. However, the two sides in the war have not made much progress for the time being. Of course, progress needs to be strived for both subjectively and objectively. - Losing a place today and capturing a city tomorrow may seem different on the surface, but in reality, it is still a performance of time. In the new stage of total war, the form of war will inevitably change from a stalemate of stalemate to a comprehensive struggle. Understanding this principle, there is no need to be anxious about the current war situation, because this is not a short-term matter. Reforming politics, building production, and contributing all manpower and materials to the country, and integrating one's own interests with the interests of the country, this is the current key. Enough small talk, let's get back to the main topic.

The War in Guangdong is Like a Seesaw

In Guangdong, the Dongjiang, Shilong, and Zengcheng areas have been captured by the Chinese army several times. However, in order to consolidate Guangzhou, the Japanese side has to fight desperately for Zengcheng and other places. Therefore, Zengcheng and other places have been captured by the Chinese army several times and then captured by the Japanese army several times, just like a seesaw, always fighting back and forth.

According to a Hong Kong dispatch on the 17th, "In the area between Shitan and Dongguan in the East River, the Chinese and Japanese armies fought fiercely in the Dongguan area. Yesterday, a part of the Japanese army in the North River attacked Xin Street on the Yuehan Road, and another part attacked Huaxian in the north. Both of the above places are now in fierce fighting. As for the West River, the line from Lubao Jiang'an to Gulao is also under stalemate."

However, recently, the Japanese army has suffered setbacks in the South China war and has made great attempts to open up the situation. It is said that Japanese warships along the coast of Zhongshan have been frequently increased. The number of large and small ships has increased to more than 100, carrying a lot of military supplies. It is reported that the Zhongshan authorities have destroyed the relevant routes and are on strict alert.

The War in Northern Hunan is Like Kicking a Ball

The war in the Northern Hunan area has been intermittent, just like a ball, kicking back and forth. According to a dispatch from Miluo: "Recently, the Chinese army has ventured out in the wind and snow and extreme cold, moving vertically and horizontally in the Yuezhou Linxiang area. Although the Japanese army has tried its best to repair the road line between Wu and Yue, it cannot guarantee that it will not be cut off by the Chinese army. At present, in addition to building fortifications on both sides of the Pu Yue Railway, the Japanese army in Taolin, Yuezhou, has concentrated its forces and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army to the east of Yuezhou. On the one hand, it has also driven its Japanese army at the Wujiang Bridge to the south, attacking the Chinese side's Shuanglongwan, in order to contain the Chinese field army from supporting the north. They are now in fierce fighting."

The War in Western Shanxi is Winning Victories

The war in Western Shanxi is still in full swing. Although the Japanese army is launching a full-scale attack on Western Shanxi, its purpose is nothing more than to eliminate the main force of the Chinese army and then cross the river to attack Shaanxi Province. However, the Chinese side has long been prepared for this attempt. As a result of the fierce fighting last week, the Chinese side once abandoned Jixian, Daning, Puxian, and Xiangning due to strategic reasons. Recently, the Chinese army has been reinforced and has begun a major counter-offensive. After three days and nights of hard fighting, it finally recovered all the lost lands one after another. According to a telegram from Xi'an:

"After the Chinese army in Western Shanxi captured Daning Wucheng, it advanced rapidly to the north. The Chinese armies in Puxian and Heilongguan have joined forces, approaching Tumen and attacking Linfen. At the same time, a large part of the Chinese army is besieging Shilou."

### Eye-Obscuring Trick

— Lu Jin

It is said that itinerant tricksters all have a kind of "magic" that allows them to deceive people without their knowing it. This "magic" is called "eye-obscuring trick." It means that as long as your eyes are momentarily obscured by them, your money or valuables will disappear in the blink of an eye. Magicians have a saying, "In the blink of an eye, an old hen turns into a duck," which is similar.

The "dog-skin plaster" sellers on the streets also use this "eye-obscuring trick" to swindle money from country folk, but they are a bit more like "forced sales," which makes timid people shy away. The clever tricksters tell you that a one-dollar bill can be turned into a hundred dollars. If you don't believe it, you can try it on the spot. So, the servants in mansions and the clerks in shops think that "there is a way to make money," and they steal or pilfer to gather a sum of money. They sincerely kowtow to some patriarch, but with that one kowtow, the banknotes turn into waste paper, and the trickster has flown away, either picking up a hostess in a hotel or indulging in strong liquor in a restaurant.

Now, this "magic" has become "widely used," and even nations that demand others to "kneel" do not hesitate to "lower themselves" to using the "eye-obscuring trick."

For example, they first release the news that they have invested millions in Chinese film companies, claiming it is the beginning of "cultural cooperation." But the Chinese film companies remain unmoved, and the eyes of the Chinese people are also watching very clearly. Then they say that "so-called cultural figures and many writers have been sent to Shanghai to actively engage in activities together with film industry representatives," and they cite the "companies" they have bought out as examples to "lobby" various parties. But what is the result? "The film industry in this city has adhered to a scorched earth policy since the war, fighting against the environment. No amount of enticement or coercion will move them. Their righteousness is awe-inspiring, and their attitude is firm!" And those "companies" that do not cherish themselves have long been spurned by the Chinese people!

The "eye-obscuring trick" can only be used on wavering people. For example, if you don't want to get rich, the trick has no way to work. If you are awe-inspiring in your righteousness, there is naturally no way to act. "One hand cannot cover the eyes and ears of all the people." Now they are only obscuring the "eyes," so their failure is almost certain!

Moreover, when it comes to real swords and guns, let's have a "hundred-year war."

At that time, Mr. Song Zhide, the author of "Wu Zetian," changed his pen name to "Song Yizhou" because of He Mengfu's relationship and was working as a screenwriter at the Northwest Film Company. As he spent more and more time with Ms. Wang, they fell in love with each other. So, the two of them frankly began a sweet cohabitation of sexual love.

In the summer of the 25th year of the Republic, they came to Shanghai again and lived in the small building of a grocery store on Rue Lupan.

Wang Ping and Lao Song, the two of them, not only shared the same aspirations and personalities, but even their hobbies were the same. Both of them were very generous, casual, liked to smoke cigarettes, and loved to drink Shaoxing wine. Look, it's really a pair of lovers that are hard to find even if you wear out your iron shoes, a veritable "match made in heaven"!

This is not a joke, it's all true: Wang Ping's single cheongsam in the summer, it is said that she does not change it. Today it's this one, tomorrow it's this one, and the day after tomorrow it's still this one. Is it dirty? Who cares, anyway, she wears it on her own body, it's none of anyone else's business. When it's really too dirty to wear anymore, she takes it off and throws it under the bed, and that's the end of it. Old Song? It's the same. If you go to his house to play, all you see is his smelly socks all over the house, one on the bed, two on the floor, and one on the writing desk. But, both of them "turn a blind eye," and no one cares.

On the other hand, they are also the most revolutionary couple of artists on the stage. In order to awaken all the Chinese people, they traveled all over the country. For one year and five months, they endured all kinds of hardships, always gritting their teeth and tenaciously working on the drama movement to save the nation.

Now, they are in Chongqing. I hope that the seeds of national salvation drama that they sowed there will bloom into beautiful flowers in the near future.

Salute, a pair of artists who are working hard to save the nation through drama!

### Anecdotes from the Stage

— Qu Shigong

Ms. Wang Ping, who wears light makeup and loves to braid her hair into two small braids, those who have seen the Shanghai Amateur Drama Troupe's performance of "Wu Zetian" will not soon forget the vivid image she created of the old nun in the play.

Wang Ping, she is from Nanjing, and her real name should be written as "Guangzhen."

Yes, Wang Ping is Wang Guangzhen. If you are not forgetful, you should also remember an event that caused a sensation in the theatrical circles of Nanjing and Shanghai, no, the whole country, in the spring of the 24th year of the Republic—a female teacher at Xingzhongmen Elementary School in Nanjing was dismissed by the school authorities for participating in the performance of Ibsen's famous play "A Doll's House" by the Mofeng Drama Society? The female teacher in question is none other than Ms. Wang Ping, whom I am introducing today.

After Wang Guangzhen was kicked out of Xingzhongmen Elementary School in the capital, she went to the Northwest Film Company in Taiyuan, Shanxi, through the introduction of friends, and became a movie actor under the mercury lamps. The name "Wang Ping" was also changed at this time.

"Sea of the North"

A Paramount Pictures Production Showing at the Grand Theater

"Fishing Light of the North" is a story about two tough guys who are as close as brothers. Taylor and Jim are both fishermen. Taylor is later lured by the pirate Ridley to join forces and steal the fishermen's fish traps. Jim wounds him. "Ridley sees that the situation is not good, abandons Taylor, and leads the crowd to escape. Jim orders Taylor to return to shore for treatment."

After being defeated by the fishermen, Ridley hates Jim to the bone and thinks of revenge. "Taylor knows that he has evil intentions and begs to go with him." On the way, he takes the opportunity to lock Ridley in the cabin, and he himself steers the ship toward an iceberg. Both the ship and the man are destroyed and buried in the blue sea.

This story is tragic, and the friendship between Taylor and Jim is even more touching. Through the screen, the simple scenery of the fishing village and the strong and straightforward character of the bloody men are truly endearing. They are playful, jumping and闹闹, not knowing what is called worry, and such a simple temperament is due to their strong bodies, which not only makes people feel cute, but also makes people envious. What is even more touching is the fishermen's resistance to pirates, using the power of life to protect the East Four obtained by the power of life, so that it is not damaged; in that tense weaving, people are reminded of our damaged fishery and fishermen, as well as the brothers who are fighting for the survival of the motherland. Jim's close-up of his dismayed brain after shooting Taylor with a gun is touching, and what is the audience's reaction in their hearts? "A good doctor has no private relationships." No matter from which point of view, it is not wrong to blame him for being so cautious.

"Fishing Light of the North" focuses on the friendship between Taylor and Jim, so it reduces the suffering of the fishermen and the power of the masses, which is the greatest loss. Otherwise, this play would have had greater value.

As it is now, it certainly makes us feel the preciousness of friendship, and also touches the vitality of those bloody men, because in this way it makes the young masters of the foreign concession who only know how to talk about love seem incapable and hateful, but if this torrent of life is returned to the sea, surging and rushing in the tide, what an exciting scene would that be?

Director Henry Hathaway has valuable experience in such plays, thick and exciting, and has his own spirit. In particular, each role, under his treatment, appears so rich in vitality and so different, which is truly admirable.

George Raft's Taylor is not bad, although strictly speaking, he still has a bit of the ruffian flavor of the city, and is not purely a simple fisherman; Henry Fonda is a little timid, and the play is well-acted, but the appearance always feels less solid; what is admirable is Dorothy Lamour, her city's seductive breath has been washed away, and her healthy physique helps her become a lively and lively character, Akim Tamiroff's Ridley is very commensurate with his appearance, and the play is also very stable; John Barrymore plays the chief writer of a local newspaper here, the play is not important, the old artists ah!

### Sketches of the Slums

— Zhi

At the corner of Singapore Road, what unfolds before people's eyes is a tragic picture of refugees.

In the rugged pile of rocks, only a few wooden boards are used to cover some straw, and this becomes their home.

In this simple house, they eat, sleep, and even defecate here.

On a broken door, Xiao Sanzi has filled it with many drawings, and the red paper strip of "Jiang Taigong is here" has been blown off halfway by the north wind.

Because there is no drain, the sewage naturally gathers together, accumulating more and more, and gradually becomes a pond. Although it is the cold winter season, there is still a damp and stinky smell that comes into the nose.

If it rains for several days in a row, it is even worse. Not only are the roads muddy and impassable, but also the house will drip with drizzle.

The people living in this house, whether men, women, old or young, cannot be like the refugees in the shelter, folding their hands and only knowing how to eat. Every day, for the sake of three meals that are not enough to eat, they have to shed their blood and sweat to maintain their lives.

Most of the men go to pull rickshaws, work as dock coolies, peddlers... It is considered lucky for women to be able to go to work in factories, otherwise they will squat on the ground and knock on stones, and even children have to carry bamboo baskets to pick up waste.

It is pitiful enough that they are struggling on the edge of hunger, working hard, but there are often unexpected misfortunes, such as the landlord's order to move, and the layers of extortion by the intermediaries, all of which make them have no power to resist. Apart from weeping and swallowing their anger and trying to make the best of it, it can be said that there is no other way!

I hope that enthusiastic social figures will no longer ignore this small group and give them strong support.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

Chapter Two: Engineer Lin Ingeniously Explains Standardization, Director Jin Eloquently Discusses the Concept of Equality

Moreover, although the two of them are classmates in technology, they each have their own hobbies outside of technology. He Shuangyu likes music, while He Peiyu likes painting. This can be considered as each tending to one end, but both of them are equally clever. Miss Jin said with a smile at that time, "Yu Gang, when we were talking about standardization, I thought, now all kinds of crafts have to be standardized, how can people also be standardized? It's not that people are also standardized, how can you two sisters be the same?" He Peiyu said, "Don't talk nonsense!" Jin Danyu said, "It's because it's nonsense that I didn't say it just now. Otherwise, Jiancheng can say anything." Just as she was talking about Jiancheng, she saw Jiancheng coming from afar. She asked them if they had bought the flowers yet? She said, "I've bought them." Miss Jin paid a dollar for them, and Mama Huang said, "There's still some left over." Miss Jin said, "Forget it! Forget it!" Lin Jiancheng accompanied them and entered the White Stone Archway. The size and grandeur of that martyr's tomb are no less than Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum in Nanjing. Only, Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum is built on a mountain, while this one is built on a plain. From the White Stone Archway, there is a passage, and the pine and cypress trees on both sides have grown into lush forests. The passage leads directly to a hall, which is where the public comes to worship and commemorate on the spring and autumn equinoxes and memorial days. Outside the hall, there is a very wide white stone platform, and there are also some stone carvings of art, all of which were donated by various countries at that time. In addition, there are large pots of flowers and trees, planted with evergreen trees and unfading flowers, and they are cleaned up in a particularly clean way. Turning from the cloister next to the hall to the back, you reach the martyr's tomb, a large square area with a bun-shaped top, like the tops of churches. In front of it, there is a large marble tombstone with golden inscriptions. Around it, there are many vases filled with flower branches, all of which are filled with flower branches. Some of the flower branches have already withered, and some of the flower branches are still fresh, which shows that there is always someone who comes here every day to admire the martyr's tomb and offer flowers. The two Miss He also inserted each of the bouquets they were holding into the vases. Coincidentally, there were two empty vases side by side, and Miss Jin helped them to insert the bouquets in, which was just right. It turned out that the flower shop here knew the size of the bouquets, and then they paid their respects to the past martyrs and the pioneers who died for the country, and remained silent for a minute or two. After a little while, it was already lunchtime. Miss Jin said, "Then let's go and have lunch! After lunch, let's go and see a few more places here. What do you think?" (20)

### Anna May Wong Changes Her Style

— Xiao

Among the movie stars of Hollywood, descendants of the Yellow Emperor are rare—there are only two, and coincidentally both of them are surnamed "Huang": the first is the photographer Huang Zongzhan, who is often seen for his art but not seen in person; the second is Anna May Wong, who often plays Chinese people in foreign films.

Her father is an overseas Chinese who has lived in the United States for a long time. She was born in Los Angeles, USA, and before she returned to her motherland, she had never left Los Angeles even a step. Because Los Angeles is very close to Hollywood, the capital of the film industry, she was influenced by what she saw and heard, and she became interested in movies from a young age—she almost always watched movies after school every day; at the same time, because she admired the life of movie stars, she developed the desire to become a movie star when she grew up.

When she was a child at home, her name was "Huang Liushuang", but when she entered the American school, it was changed to "Naimaie Huang". At the age of twelve, she acted as an extra in "The Red Lantern" (Red Lantern) starring Mrs. Yue (the late Qi Mu star) and achieved considerable success. Since then, she has served as an extra in "The Moon Palace Treasure Box" starring Helen Peters. Since then, she has not only been welcomed for her film technology but also praised on the stage in New York, especially in the famous play On the spot by the great writer Edgar Wallace, she is even more admired by the beautiful women. In the past, her style was somewhat unsatisfactory—she mostly performed in films that insulted China; but since she first returned to her motherland for travel several years ago, her style has changed. As usual, she also performs on the radio under the management of the British Broadcasting Corporation, boasting for her motherland and appealing for the war of resistance of her motherland.

"Filial Daughter Punishes the Wicked", " Corpse's Rebuke", and "Horoscope Washes Injustices When are you Born, which have been showing in major theaters in the isolated island this year, are works after she changed her style.

### Talk About Southern Opera

— (Bihua)

Southern opera, because it is prefixed with the word "Southern", is indeed popular in the South. It was also popular in Shanghai for a while. Most of the actors are from Wu, the lyrics are derived from Kunqu opera, and most of the audience is from Suzhou. Women especially flocked to it. The reason is that the lyrics are popular and thought-provoking, but they are all performed in amusement parks. Although they once formed an independent troupe, because the dramas they arranged were all old-fashioned and monotonous, without creativity, it was difficult to gain a foothold, and they failed one after another. Recently, they have been running on the radio, living a broadcast life, and are quite popular with the audience. I think that if Southern opera can be reformed again and new plays can be arranged, it is not difficult to occupy a place in the drama world. It is a pity that they stick to the old ways and do not seek progress, and they are lagging behind like Weibang opera and Bengbeng opera. Thinking of this, how can I not be filled with emotion! I hope that those who lead Southern opera will strive to make progress and not let Shaoxing opera and Shenqu opera be beautiful in front of them.

### A Note on "The Moon Rises" and Other One-Act Plays

— Jiangshang

Yilin Drama Society - Second Performance

Yesterday was the second performance of the Yilin Drama Society's Sunday Theater. I know very little about the past of this society, but the impression given to me by these two performances has made me very interested. This performance includes: "Matchmaking", "The Moon Rises", "The Man Who Rides a Horse into the Sea", three one-act plays. I will write some of what I have seen below, and I think it will be welcome to the comrades who love drama.

Regarding the issue of scripts, some people blame the Yilin Society for not being in line with the times. However, in this environment, with heavy pressure, even if there are very good and very suitable scripts for the times, they cannot be rehearsed. Therefore, both performances are of the social problem type. The three one-act play scripts used this time, except for "Matchmaking" which was written by Chen Baichen, the other two are imported goods.

The first play to open was "Matchmaking". The plot is that the poet married three wives, but none of them could grow old together. So he posted a matchmaking advertisement, preparing to play with all the women in a big way to avenge himself. But all those who came to apply were poor worms, which made him very disappointed. Finally, his second wife came again. She finally saw through his tricks and made an excuse to leave. The poet ended up failing. Lingzi played the poet, and in terms of identity, it was much more suitable than the son he played in the last time's "Liu Sanye". His only strength is his clear pronunciation. In terms of action, there are many unconscious excesses. But it doesn't feel like there are any drawbacks.

The second play is "The Moon Rises". The plot is that a sheriff wants to get a reward and visits an escaped prisoner in the middle of the night. He meets a street singer, but unexpectedly the street singer is the prisoner, and also the sheriff's old friend from before. The sheriff, motivated by loyalty and righteousness, finally let him escape. The original play is very thought-provoking and has a satirical power. Wang Zhuyou, who plays the sheriff, and Yang Youwei, who plays the street singer, have a lot of experience in acting. The sheriff's movements are quite beautiful, and it is very rare that the street singer acts completely differently before and after being discovered as a prisoner.

The last one is "The Man Who Rides a Horse into the Sea". The plot is very simple. An Irish old woman loses a son who loves to sail and adventure. Only two daughters are left to comfort her. The meaning of the play is implicit and too hidden, and most of the audience finds it difficult to understand. In this play, Tang Qi, who plays the eldest daughter, and Ju Nian, who plays the second daughter, Nora, have clear and sweet tones and are very natural and effortless. In addition, Bai Di, who plays the mother, can still be competent.

I think that what is more important in acting in spoken drama and other dramas is that the talents of all the characters in the play, whether they are leading roles or supporting roles, must be commensurate. The incompetence of one supporting role will make the whole play inferior. Drama is an important tool for public education. I hope that the Yilin Society can work hard and strive forward without fear of hardship!

### News from the Pear Garden

The Shanghai Lingjie United Association performed voluntary operas for Pushan Villa on the 19th and 20th, and sold a total of 3,331.96 yuan, which has been sent to Pushan in full, and the villa issued a receipt and thanked them in a letter.

The Yifeng Drama Society of the Carlton Theater will perform the same cast and the same story next spring, and will add old male actor Zhang Yueting and female actor Qian Shuming. All preparations have been completed, and there are still two female actors in negotiations.

The rehearsal of the five-part opera "Zhang Guolao Gets Married" at the Tianchan Stage has begun after the end of last night's show. It is scheduled to be performed on Friday (27th). There is news that the literary and martial old male actor Li Ruchun has joined.

Playwright Yin Sheng and wealthy merchant Xiao Eshi have returned to Shanghai from Siam. For this trip, Yin will organize the China Art Group and invite roles, and Xiao plans to organize the China Overseas Chinese Autumn Movie Company in Annam.

### Silver Screen News

— Xinshi

Photographer Yan Hewu used 16mm small film last year to shoot a Shanghai opera film of Xiaowenbin he made himself—the play "Virtuous Daughter-in-Law" achieved considerable success. For this reason, he decided to organize a company dedicated to shooting plays with small films, because its playback effect is the same as ordinary films, and the cost is much lower, which is indeed a good way to be clever. Recently, he is busy looking for a suitable base to prepare to build a studio. The first film script has been prepared, named "Butterfly Girl"—it is a story mixed with Miao people. Li Pingqian has been hired as the director, and Gu Lanjun and Sun Min will star. At the same time, it is also planned to use airplanes to send them to the United States for washing, and to shoot them as local color films. Once this plan is realized, it will set a new record for domestic films.

"Mr. Wang" Tang Jie has entered Sichuan twice and has gone through many hardships. In the autumn of last year, he returned to Shanghai early and was hired by Xinhua. His old partner "Xiao Chen" Cao Xuesong is still staying in Sichuan, engaged in the war of resistance. The two of them are now separated by thousands of miles, each going his own way; just like Laurel and Hardy, they have broken up. Recently, Tang Jie has written a new script for "Mr. Wang Has Trouble Eating", which is a humorous work that depicts the coldness of the world and the pain of unemployment, which will make people shed tears from laughter. In the play, the role of "Xiao Chen" does not appear, only a letter of introduction sent from Sichuan to "Mr. Wang" to recommend business; this is specifically to hide it because Cao Xuesong is not in Shanghai, which is quite ingenious.

Tan Ying's right side of the nose recently suffered from a boil; at first, it was very fierce and painful; medical treatment was ineffective, so she was very anxious. After being introduced by a friend, she changed to Dr. Tao Basheng for treatment, and it turned out to be very successful: now her pink cheeks have long been free of swelling and the boil has disappeared, leaving only a small scar. Dr. Tao also said: "It can be guaranteed to restore the original state, and it will definitely not damage the beauty like a slight blemish." They are very important in filming movies on this aspect, and Tan Ying was very happy with this result, and almost took a reassurance pill!

### Anecdotes of Renowned Dan Performer Feng Zihe

— Jinglu

Chun Hang has recently returned to perform at the Golden Theater. This elder performer had long ago washed off the theatrical makeup and vanished from the stage. But due to the earnest invitation from Zhou Xinfang during the French celebrations, he couldn't refuse the deep affection and agreed to make a guest appearance for two days, revealing his former brilliance once more. His grand and authentic voice and exemplary style remain intact, truly a treasure of the operatic world. I know that this performance will surely captivate many Zhou enthusiasts. Many anecdotes from his life are recorded here, offered for those who love Feng.

Feng Lang's fame preceded that of Wan Hua. At the time, only Jia Biyun could rival him. But operatic circles each supported their favorites, leading to the terms "Feng faction" and "Jia faction." His fellow townsman, Sun Juxian, greatly valued Zihe, as they both belonged to the Dan Gui troupe. Sun rarely agreed to co-star in the play "San Niang Teaches Her Son" with anyone, because Xue Bao had to kneel before San Niang. The only exception was Chun Hang. Whenever there were banquets, even if there was no "little Feng," he would always be brought along. His support was unwavering, to this extent.

Feng became famous in his time for performing the play "Feng Xiaoqing." In the fourth year of the Republic [1915], he once traveled to West Lake in Hangzhou with Liu Yazi, Lu Ebu, and other scholars. They lingered for a long time before Xiaoqing's tomb on Gushan, paying their respects. Yazi specially erected a monument beside the tomb to commemorate the event, leaving it as a captivating tale on the lake, forever associated with this peerless beauty.

People often say that Wan Hua invented ancient costumes, but in fact, Zihe was far ahead of him. For example, the trailing robes worn in the play "Seventh of July" were one such creation. They were magnificent and beautiful, and female performers at the time all competed to imitate them. In addition, he also pioneered new opera vernacular, eliminated front-line codas, and added the erhu to the orchestra. When performing the play "Drunken Concubine," his elder brother, Feng Sanguo, played the jinghu, Wu Guifen played the erhu, and he sang the so-na and erhuang with his small voice. Plays such as "Da Xiangshan," "The Wife's Party Shares the Evil Reward," and "Selling Flowers San Niangzi" were all examples. His contributions to the art of opera were truly significant.

This elder performer had a thorough understanding of both Western and Chinese cultures. In his later years, he became fond of Buddhism and enjoyed discussing Zen with others. Recently, he wrote in my commemorative album, "All beings are originally Buddhas, and Buddhas are also beings. The dust of eons has neither beginning nor end, and the wonderful lotus flower is neither ancient nor new." His brushstrokes were bold and sharp. He was truly one of the first among performers to advocate for elegance and refinement.

### A Brief Talk on Jin Suwen

— Ni Qiuping

Isn't it strange? The first time I saw Suwen, she looked so familiar, as if I had seen her somewhere before. I couldn't figure it out. Perhaps she just has a naturally likeable face. We don't need to use flowery descriptions to describe a woman's beauty. If you want to see Suwen's face, there's a photo here to prove it. She is very worldly and understands human nature. When she speaks, she has a youthful innocence, a bit hesitant, not yet fully grown up, and gets anxious easily – all characteristic of a woman.

I haven't been to the opera much lately, so I haven't seen Suwen on stage yet. The other night, I saw "Wen Sucheng." That play goes without saying, it's very good. She played Xuan Gu in it, and she truly portrayed her vividly. We don't need to compare her with Yu Ziyun or Shi Xiaofu here! Theater follows the times, and this kind of play follows the trends, so actors must do the same, which is really not easy.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Opera World of the Old Capital (83)

— Xu Muyun

We Shanghai people (actually, I am not a Shanghai native, but I have lived in Shanghai for twenty years, so I can use the word "we"). We are indeed too foolish and stupid. Every year, Beijing opera performers take at least two hundred thousand in cash back to the old capital to buy houses and land. Moreover, theater owners have to send people to pick them up and drop them off, as if they were revering celestial beings. These famous performers put on quite an act. Although they say they are not very willing to come to the South, in reality, every one of them cranes their necks waiting for someone from Shanghai to come and fetch them. It's truly a case of "eating fish and disliking the smell, raising a lover and pretending to be pure." (i.e., claiming to be innocent). When it comes down to it, they all think coming to Shanghai is a great opportunity to make a fortune, but they just deliberately put on airs. Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Li Shengzao, and others are now all leading roles who bring their own troupes. Every time they decide to come to Shanghai, they demand about ten to twenty thousand in large denominations. However, when they were still apprentices, they all wore long blue coarse cloth gowns, had shaven heads, and ate simple, rough food. If someone was performing a major role on a particular day, the troupe leader would specially give them eight large copper coins (i.e., sixteen copper plates) to drink bean juice and eat fried dough sticks (i.e., youtiao). Usually, they would get only four or six large plates, and some wouldn't even get one. Yet they still had to perform well. If they didn't, they might even get beaten. But every ticket sold (nowadays, the ticket price for Fu Liancheng also sells for at least one hundred and fifty or sixty yuan, and if there are performances both day and night, they can earn more than three hundred yuan.)
