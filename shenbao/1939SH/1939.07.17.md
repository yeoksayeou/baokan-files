### Japan's New Offensive and the War Situation

Yesterday's newspaper reported news from Hong Kong that the Japanese side is planning to launch a new offensive. It is claimed that after July, Japan will use five divisions to attack Yichang, three divisions to encircle Changsha from Western Jiangxi, and six divisions to harass Northern Hunan along Dongting Lake. Such news is not the most reliable intelligence. Therefore, the adoption of the offensive, the timing of the launch, the number of troops used, and the target of the attack, the news that is transmitted is whether it coincides with the Japanese plan. These are all issues and cannot be regarded as completely true. However, based on the experience of the past two years, news from Hong Kong is sometimes extremely sensitive and has had many successes in the past. Moreover, the Japanese side has its own reasons for taking another offensive; it is said that riding on the back of a tiger makes it impossible to get off. This is ultimately the sad fate of those who are arrogant and impetuous, and the ultimate stumbling block of those who are trivial. The knowledgeable people had already estimated this, it is not unexpected. As for how to determine the ending, it is only a matter of time. Therefore, we do not ask what the news is based on or where it comes from, but would rather solemnly expect the confirmation of subsequent news.

War is action, and victory or defeat is a fact. The final fact is an indisputable ironclad case. As for the situation in the middle of the journey, it is not to be relied upon. Long-distance competition is the most accurate metaphor: Liu Changchun was magnificent, he grasped the quick battle and quick victory to win in the initial 100 meters, 200 meters, and even 400 meters and 800 meters; but when he left the stadium watched by thousands of eyes and turned inland, circling a large circle, there was absolutely no place for him; the final victory inevitably belonged to Wang Zheng, who was skinny and seemed to be undernourished. Now, it is clear that it is a long-distance race, but at the moment of 400 meters and 800 meters, ordering to stop, conspiring to stop, whether it is on the grounds of Wang Zheng's sweaty head, or with a compassionate attitude, but how can it cover up the fact that Liu Changchun is just a sprinter? Joy, anger, sorrow, and joy, all vividly exposed his lack of understanding; what is the benefit of praising Liu Changchun and cursing Wang Zheng? Knowing that there is no need to praise or curse, we remain silent and do not talk much about the war situation. Now that we occasionally receive the above-mentioned news from Hong Kong, please discuss our views on the war situation based on the news.

The Japanese side initially hoped for a quick battle and quick victory, and only prepared for a quick battle and quick victory. After the initial failure, the second step was to hope to achieve complete success before being exhausted, and perhaps still be able to annex and do whatever they wanted. After the second step was desperate, the third step was to hope for a wonderful method, to change the method, and permanently maintain the military occupied area obtained in the initial stage of the war. The current war situation is moving from the second step to the third step.

Moving from the second step to the third step, politics and economy are emphasized, and military affairs are de-emphasized. Assuming that it is easy to lift a weight, it is indeed wonderful, but the fact is not so. Let's take a shallow and near example: First, the two organizations in Nanjing and Beiping not only cannot share the burden of the Japanese army, but also cannot exist without the protection of the Japanese army; second, if the Japanese army lets go of the local organizations in various places without intervening, they are not at ease, but if they let go, they will only see the traitors taking advantage of the fire; third, the legal currency has plummeted in the black market, from one shilling two five to six seven pence; the enemy claps their hands and cheers when the legal currency plummets, who knows that one Japanese yen is only worth nine corners of the legal currency, in other words, the Japanese yen has closely followed the devaluation of the legal currency. This politically and economically shows that the second step to the third step still cannot be done without military hard work. This is probably the main reason for taking a new offensive. From a military perspective, "offense is the best defense" has its own technical reasons, so attacking Yichang is to protect Wuhan, attacking Changsha is to protect Nanchang, and attacking Northern Hunan is to protect Yuezhou; moreover, it is not only that. First, those who are arrogant and impetuous have not yet given up hope of "achieving complete success"; they do not know the arrival of the end until the end, so they take the offensive. Second, China openly declared that it would take a mobile combat; that is, under the meaning of the War of Resistance, it always uses the two methods of firm defense and counterattack; therefore, if the Japanese army does not attack Yichang, the Chinese army will attack Wuhan, that is, if the Japanese army cannot take Yichang, it cannot defend Wuhan, so it takes the offensive. Third, the war situation has been dull for three months, is the War of Resistance exhausted, or is the reorganization, training, and replenishment about to be completed; the matter needs to be probed, so it takes the offensive. There are these three reasons in military affairs, which have evolved into a possible offensive. In addition, the Tokyo negotiations between Britain and Japan use the momentum of a greater military voice on the white version as the strongest diplomatic backing; to the extreme, if China abandons the War of Resistance, Britain would have been driven out of the Far East long ago, how could there be the current Tokyo negotiations; if the Japanese army drives straight in, Britain would have lost its foothold long ago, how could there be the current Tokyo negotiations; if China has driven the Japanese army out of its territory, how could there be the current Tokyo negotiations; it can be seen that there is an inseparable relationship between the Chinese war situation and the Tokyo negotiations, then, at the beginning of the Tokyo negotiations, the Japanese side expressed that they would take another offensive, which also has its own international reasons. The truth and falsehood of the Soviet-Japanese war in Nomonhan, the cause and effect, and the propaganda, will not be explored in depth; but it has made the Japanese discouraged, and the Japanese army has been at a loss, which is inevitable. Therefore, while transferring troops to support several routes, they can only claim that they will take another offensive in China. The most can cover up the embarrassing situation of being stretched; this is another international reason.

This is a long-distance race! No matter how long the distance is, it is always getting closer; whether Japan takes a new offensive or China launches a general counter-offensive, it is always an important dynamic approaching the end. The facts created by the dynamics cannot be anesthetized by praise or curse; nor can they be changed by all the joys, sorrows, and joys; the final fact is the most certain destination; before the final destination, taking a new offensive as an important stage, we can wait and see.

### Military Affairs Committee Announces Weekly War Report

(Chongqing) The Military Affairs Committee issued a statement saying that in the past week, the war on all fronts has continued to progress, with particularly fierce fighting along the Taihang Mountains. A summary of the combat operations is as follows:

Jin-Yu Front: After the Japanese army suffered heavy defeats at the hands of the Chinese army in southern and western Shanxi last month, they regrouped on a large scale at the beginning of this month and launched an offensive against the Chinese army in the Taihang Mountains in five routes. One force proceeded from Pingyao and Longyao. After the Chinese army bravely resisted, in the Battle of Pingyao, over a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed, and over eight hundred corpses were abandoned in Liuwangzhen and Yangcun near Heshun, and they fled. Liaoxian was subsequently reported to have been recaptured. One force attempted to peer east into Chenshui and Yangcheng from Yicheng. After a week of bloody fighting, the Japanese advance was halted and they are currently deadlocked in the area west of Qinshui. One force attacked Huixian from Xinxiang to the north. After the Chinese army employed mobile tactics to encircle and severely attack the Japanese, who were in dire straits, they repeatedly requested aid from Xinxiang. One force advanced from Bo'ai to the southwest on two fronts, and after being encircled and annihilated at Xiaoweiying, five to six hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese army urgently sent reinforcements from Xinxiang, but they were ambushed en route, resulting in significant casualties. Under the Chinese army's encirclement, ambush, and interception, the five routes of the Japanese army have all become spent arrows, with no strength to attack again.

Guangdong Front: The remaining Japanese forces in Dongguan, Dongjiang, were wiped out by the Chinese army's fierce attack, and the county seat has been recaptured. As for the Japanese army in Chao'an, on the evening of the 7th, they launched a fierce attack against the Bijia Mountain to the north. More than five hundred Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Japanese, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed and retreated to Donglong and Nanting. Another unit of the Chinese army took the opportunity to recapture Chenghai County. The outer defenses of Chao'an are now completely surrounded and controlled. The Japanese army at Longkou, Beijiang, harassed Pingshan and Lianglong on the morning of the 11th, but were intercepted near Lianglong and suffered a hasty retreat. Subsequently, the Japanese reinforced with over sixteen hundred infantry soldiers, and four airplanes provided air support, attacking the Chinese army on two fronts. The Chinese army employed mobile tactics, luring the Japanese into a pre-set ambush and launching a major encirclement. The Japanese fled in disarray, abandoning over four hundred corpses. The Japanese army in Xijiang, under the cover of artillery fire on the 11th, advanced on two fronts, one attacking Dieshi, and the other besieging Xinhui and Zhongshan. The Chinese garrison fiercely resisted, and the Japanese made no progress. Japanese warships gathered in the Mushi and Shimen waters were shelled by Chinese artillery, suffering considerable losses. The situation in Xinhui and Jiangmen is becoming increasingly stable, and the Japanese offensive has faltered.

Gan-Xiang-E Front: On the north and south banks of the Xiu River in northern Jiangxi, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army in Wuning from multiple routes starting on the morning of the 10th. The soldiers were loyal and brave, and have achieved many victories in recent days. On the north bank, after recapturing the Xidaqiao river stronghold, they continued to advance towards the county seat. On the south bank, a unit of the Chinese army broke through the Japanese defense line on the Xiu River and stormed into Yutianqiao and Jinkou, bombarding the city walls with artillery. The Japanese army within the city was under attack from all sides by the Chinese and was in great disarray, showing signs of fleeing. Another elite unit, after mopping up the Japanese army near Fengxin, fiercely pressed on the outskirts of the city, inflicting many casualties. Over a thousand Japanese soldiers in southern Hubei launched an offensive against Shentangpu and Tangpingpu for three days and nights. Due to the continuous arrival of Japanese reinforcements, the Chinese positions were temporarily breached by the Japanese army, but they immediately counterattacked and recaptured them completely. The remaining Japanese forces fled in disarray, and after pursuing them to the vicinity of Chongyang, over two hundred more were killed. The battle has now subsided. As for northern Hunan, the Japanese army that had invaded Junshan on the north bank of Dongting Lake on the morning of the 7th was pursued until the evening, and the Japanese, caught off guard, abandoned over a hundred corpses and fled by ship. The area was subsequently recaptured. In addition, within the territory of Suiyuan, our forces cut off the traffic between Guisui and Bailingmiao of the Japanese army invading from [missing characters], beheading over six hundred. In southern Henan, the remaining enemies at Luotuo Store were annihilated and Xinyang was besieged. In northern Jiangsu, Siyang was recaptured for a time, killing four to five hundred Japanese. In Anhui, they entered Huaiyuan and destroyed a large Japanese warship near Zhide. Repelling the landing Japanese troops on the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian were also important victories in the past week, and are reported here as an addendum. (15th dispatch)

### He Guoguang Discusses Chongqing's Administrative Policy

(Chongqing) According to Mayor He, the Chongqing New City Government's administrative policy has two aspects: one is passive, focusing on protection work to reduce damage to citizens; the other is active, laying the foundation for construction for future reconstruction.

### US Neutrality Act Amendment Issue: President Determined to Adhere to Original Intention, Will Appeal to National Public Opinion If Isolationists Continue to Obstruct

(Washington) Isolationist senators led by Senator Borah stated in Congress this morning that there is no prospect of the Neutrality Act being passed in this session of Congress, so Congress should adjourn on August 5. However, government senators said that this is a conspiracy to sabotage and prevent the Neutrality Act from being fairly discussed. The government side stated that if the isolationists force Congress to adjourn, President Roosevelt will make a broadcast speech to appeal to the people on the Neutrality Act issue, and will also speak on this issue while traveling along the West Coast. The President deeply feels that the international situation requires Congress to decide on the Neutrality Act immediately, and he will not compromise on the isolationists' demands. The isolationist senators are eager to return home, but seem to forget that the President can reconvene a special session of Congress. If the isolationists do not allow the Senate to discuss the Neutrality Act at this critical juncture, the President will definitely exercise his right to reconvene Congress. (10th Reuters dispatch)

### Roosevelt's Message Receives High Praise from Newspapers, Pittman's Arms Embargo Bill Awaits Hull's Response

(Washington) Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act, although President Roosevelt's message to Congress yesterday received high praise from American newspapers, people in Congress said that Congress will adjourn on August 5, and there is no hope that the Neutrality Act issue will be brought up for discussion in the current session of Congress. A liberal newspaper, the Washington Daily News, recently commented on the President's message: "It is doubtful whether Congress will be able to achieve anything in the current session. … The President Roosevelt and Secretary Hull's proposed neutrality plan should be accepted immediately by Congress. If it is shelved and Congress is eager to adjourn, then the German Nazi Party workers in the United States will be able to report to Führer Hitler that no matter what happens in the future, the United States will only act within the scope of the current Neutrality Act. However, recent public opinion polls have shown that the majority still support providing war materials to Britain and France in wartime. Once Germany initiates hostilities, the people's sentiment in support of Britain and France will quickly solidify in Congress. It is hoped that the Nazi Party workers will pay attention to this and offer a sincere warning to Führer Hitler." (16th Havas dispatch)

(Washington) Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently proposed a bill to authorize the President to prohibit the shipment of weapons, ammunition, kerosene, etc. to countries that violate the Nine-Power Treaty. According to the current situation, not only Republicans are opposed, but also the government is hesitant. The Committee is concerned that after the passage of this bill, it may conflict legally with the current US-Japan Treaty of Commerce (established in 1911, stipulating that neither signatory country may impose discriminatory treatment on the other), and has decided to first seek the opinion of Secretary of State Hull. The Secretary of State will submit a written response early next week. According to diplomatic sources, the response will state that such an embargo is inconsistent with the obligations accepted by the United States government in the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce. Observers say that the US government has no intention of denouncing the treaty, because the United States' cotton production still relies on Japan as its largest customer. In the past eleven months, Japan has purchased 846,000 bales of American cotton, worth 42,569,000 US dollars, more than twice the amount purchased by Britain. There is a large surplus of cotton in the United States, and if an embargo is imposed on Japan, Japan will definitely stop buying American cotton in retaliation, which is not something the United States wants to see. Therefore, it is almost certain that the Pittman bill will not pass. (15th Reuters dispatch)

### US Considers New Loan to China, President of US Export-Import Bank Says Previous Loan Used Successfully

(Washington) Government officials here are very satisfied with the progress of the $25 million credit loan granted by the US Export-Import Bank to China last year, a semi-official nature. Therefore, it is generally expected that the United States will likely continue to grant new loans to China. Mr. Pierson, President of the US Export-Import Bank, told a reporter from the Associated Press yesterday that he was satisfied with the progress of the previous credit loan to China. Due to the situation in the Far East, he did not want to announce how much of the $25 million credit loan had been delivered to China, but a large quantity of goods has been shipped to China. Well-informed sources believe that the issue of granting new loans and new credit loans to China depends entirely on the upcoming discussion in the US Congress of the "Increase Export-Import Bank Loan Economy" bill. An increase in loan funds seems to be no problem. Pierson continued that the smooth progress of the first loan to China is an important factor in continuing to grant loans to the Chinese government in the future. Well-informed sources claim that to date, several million US dollars of US credit loans to China have been used, mostly for the purchase of cargo vehicles. (16th Associated Press dispatch)

### Peasants Riot in Mexican Mountains, Government Troops Suppressing

Mexico City: Rumors have spread that a revolutionary movement has broken out in Mexico. Officials here have denied this, but said that disturbances occurred in a certain area in the interior around the wheat harvest season, which is true. All states have armed peasant forces, and their leaders each advocate political beliefs, or act for their own benefit, or serve a certain political party. Recently, a large armed peasant force, led by the bandit Cabecilla, has been looting in the Cuechalen Mountains. The terrain is rugged and difficult to suppress, so government troops have imposed martial law and dispatched a large army, commanded by General Cama Cho, Governor of the State of Puebla, to be responsible for the suppression. Local order has now returned to normal. (15th Havas dispatch)

### British Undersecretary and French Ambassador Discuss Diplomatic Issues, Moscow Talks Will Continue, Britain and Poland Promote Military Cooperation, French Ambassador to Britain Corbin Returns Home for Consultation

(London) French Ambassador to Britain Corbin returned home for consultation and departed last night. Before leaving, he had a long conversation with Sir Cadogan, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Sachett, Assistant Secretary. According to diplomatic sources, the topics discussed were extensive, including the Far East issue, the progress of the British-French-Soviet talks, the Polish issue, and the Spanish issue. Regarding the Far East issue, it involves the Tokyo talks between Britain and Japan. The British side has always maintained that the subject of the negotiations should be limited to resolving the Tianjin incident. Regarding the British-French-Soviet talks, the British government has sent new instructions to British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, several points of which the Ambassador requested clarification. The British and French authorities exchanged views yesterday so that the Moscow talks can continue next week. Regarding the Polish issue, General Ironside, Inspector-General of Overseas Forces of Britain, will travel to Warsaw on the 17th by plane with the Deputy Military Attaché of the Polish Embassy in Britain, for a four-day stay, and will hold talks with the Polish Army General Staff and General Smigly-Ridz, Inspector-General of the Army. It is rumored that General Ironside will take the opportunity to visit Moscow, but this statement has been denied by well-informed sources. However, if the British-French-Soviet talks are successful, General Ironside will immediately consult with the French and Soviet military authorities on the technical issues of implementing the trilateral mutual assistance agreement. It is hoped that this military conference can be held in London or Paris. Regarding the Spanish issue, since General Franco recently published a statement in the Portuguese newspaper "Noticias", stating that if war breaks out in Europe, Spain will remain neutral, this can be regarded as another favorable factor in the European situation. (15th Havas dispatch)

(London) General Ironside will fly to Poland tomorrow to begin British-Polish military talks. The purpose of the talks is to strengthen the power of joint action between the two countries in wartime and to promote the British-Polish mutual assistance agreement. In addition to seeking a permanent mutual assistance agreement, Britain also plans to provide economic assistance to Poland. (16th Associated Press dispatch)

### German Newspaper Discusses Situation in Danzig, Says Fate Depends on Britain and Soviet Union

(Berlin) The "Frankfurter Zeitung" published an article today discussing the general international situation and the Danzig issue, stating: "Britain's plan to bring the Soviet Union into the encirclement has not made much progress. Regarding the Danzig issue, Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration has repeatedly stated that Britain will provide military assistance. If war breaks out as expected, Britain will protect Poland just like the Wailing Wall. Regarding this issue, the London "Daily Express" said: "The Western democracies have no foothold in Eastern Europe. If war breaks out, Poland must mobilize an army equal to the German army in Eastern Europe. After Poland achieves final victory, it can decide its fate. The Western countries want to launch this war to destroy totalitarian countries and thus end all problems." What is the basis for this statement? We believe that if Britain treats Poland with sincerity, it should urge Poland to make peace with Germany and find a solution to the Danzig issue, because Britain is in fact unable to guarantee Poland's independence and welfare, no matter how long it takes. In fact, the fate of Danzig depends on Germany and the Soviet Union. Danzig's geographical location and political interests are all within the scope of Germany and the Soviet Union."

After they arrived at the camp, they first enjoyed a rich lunch, and then were guided to visit all parts of the camp for a week before distributing weapons and various equipment. According to the regulations of the training program, the new soldiers will be trained for six months. In the first two weeks, they will first receive preparatory training, and then receive formal military training, such as long-distance walking and various exercises. However, physical education will always occupy an important position. Those who personally inspected the barracks in various places today included Queen Mary and Minister of War Bailey Xia. The Secretary of War also made a brief speech to the trainees, stating that "You will experience an extremely democratic life here in these six months, a rare encounter in your life."

### The Baltic States Threatened by Germany: The German Minority Question and German Demands

At a time when negotiations among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are underway in the Latvian capital, Riga, the relationship between the Baltic states and Germany has drawn considerable attention from the press. The Nazi Party newspaper "Danziger Vorposten" of the Free City of Danzig recently reported that when Germany previously negotiated non-aggression treaties with Estonia and Latvia, it requested compensation for the German minority issue in those countries. This revelation has caused considerable shock among those concerned. Estonia has approximately 20,000 ethnic Germans whose legal status was resolved by the 1925 Minority Law, which even the Germans feel satisfied with. Latvia, on the other hand, has 70,000 ethnic Germans, most of whom are landowners, with the remainder being merchants, teachers, and Christian pastors, primarily residing in cities. They form a leadership class and constitute the bourgeoisie. The native Latvians are mostly farmers, economically dominated by the German landowners and culturally influenced by German teachers and pastors. Consequently, the German minority in Latvia has been able to establish its own unique identity in both economic and cultural terms, effectively creating a "state within a state." This is inconsistent with the trends in modern nation-states. It was not until 1935 that the Latvian government began to implement various measures to reform this situation, which immediately caused an uproar among the Germans, who claimed that their vital living space was being seized by Latvia and that Germany must resist with the utmost determination. Now that the "Danziger Vorposten" has stated that Germany has demands regarding the German minority issue, it is clear that Germany intends to revisit the old issue and exert pressure on the Baltic states. Given this, it is not difficult to understand why the Soviet Union raised the issue of "indirect aggression" during the negotiations among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, demanding a definition. Germany's claim that "Germandom is under threat and must be defended with action" raises the question of what degree of action would be deemed sufficient to stop. Latvia, having learned from the past events in Czechoslovakia and the Memel region, is undoubtedly aware of the threat and feels understandably uneasy. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

### How Generous are New York Beggars! Can Earn US$120 Per Month. New York Mayor Begins Anti-Begging Campaign

(New York) Mayor LaGuardia of New York has announced the start of a campaign to "eradicate" street begging. City officials estimate that New York beggars earn no less than $15 million annually. Notices have been posted on buses, trams, and subways stating that genuine paupers in New York can now receive public assistance and that the only way to eradicate begging is not to give alms to beggars. According to Mr. Hodson, the head of the New York City Welfare Bureau, it is estimated that at least 10,000 people in New York are living off begging. He also stated that a blind musician asked the city authorities to guarantee him public assistance of $125 per month, but he would still beg because he could earn at least that amount playing the violin in the street. New York beggars have guilds and clubs that use all sorts of begging techniques. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### National Socialism, Art: German Art Festival, Hitler's Speech

(Munich, Germany) Today is the German Art Festival in Munich. Leader Hitler delivered a speech here, elucidating the National Socialist view of art. He stated, "The government not only has the right to intervene in art, but it is also its duty. Every great revolution of an era must leave a distinct mark on art. Thus, art must embrace modern trends. Before 1870, our country was politically strong, but it did not fully express its national character in art. Today, art should no longer be controlled by sickly aesthetes but should be based on national life, creating a type of art that even the government should not hesitate to intervene in."

### Preliminary Anglo-Japanese Negotiations: Vastly Different Opinions: Arita Demands Recognition of New Situation in the Far East; Craigie Insists on Maintaining Existing Rights and Interests

(Tokyo) According to political figures here, the three-hour meeting between Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and Ambassador Craigie yesterday morning resulted only in a formal explanation of both sides' positions. Arita explained the reasons for Japan's actions in Tianjin, believing that Japan's measures were not only reasonable but also necessary. He stated that Anglo-Japanese relations are strained everywhere and that a satisfactory solution is impossible unless Britain is prepared to cooperate with Japan. Arita then emphasized the intensity of Japanese public opinion, stating that the British Ambassador should note that public opinion is undoubtedly leaning towards a definite solution to fundamental issues. Craigie presented the following points as the basis for negotiation: (1) The neutrality of the concessions must be respected; (2) British rights and interests in China must be maintained as they are. Craigie also stated that he was not instructed to discuss general issues; in other words, he will limit the scope of discussion to the Tianjin incident. According to political speculation, the first round of talks has indicated how the negotiations will proceed, so the distance between the two sides' opinions is undeniable. Therefore, the difficulty and length of the negotiations are expected. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)

Sir Craigie replied that the fundamental principles should be discussed after the real causes of the Tianjin dispute have been discussed. Thereupon Arita stated that understanding on fundamental principles was necessary for negotiations to proceed. It is also rumored that Arita stated that negotiations should be conducted based on Japan's views. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Italian Government Intends to Abolish Anglo-Italian Agreement: Gayda Reviews Anglo-Italian Relations

(London) There are rumors that the Italian government will abolish the Anglo-Italian Agreement (established on April 16, 1938). Political figures here commented that the agreement has long been a mere formality, but Britain does not want to initiate its abolition and allow Italy to regain freedom of action. Italy, also, does not consider it advantageous to be the first to abolish it. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

(Rome) Famous journalist Gayda (considered Mussolini's spokesperson) recently wrote an article in the "Giornale d'Italia" reviewing the current relations between Britain and Italy due to foreign newspapers' comments on the transfer of Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi to the position of Minister of Justice, some taking it as a sign of Italy changing its policy towards Britain. He stated, "It is inaccurate to say that Italy has changed its attitude towards Britain, because it is Britain, not Italy, that has changed its attitude. Since 1935, Britain's policy towards Italy has changed, adopting an aggressive and hostile attitude instead of the past harmony and understanding. When the time is right, Italy will naturally respond accordingly. Today, Italy is determined to defend its national interests and advance hand in hand with its loyal allies, regardless of any events that may occur." Political figures here commented that the Italian government may intend to declare the abolition of the Anglo-Italian Agreement established on April 16, 1938. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

### American Airplane Broker Seeks Compensation from Mitsubishi Corporation: A Total of US$265,000

(San Francisco) American export merchant Clement sued Mitsubishi Corporation in court here yesterday, demanding Mitsubishi pay $265,000 in aircraft purchase commissions. In April 1936, Lockeheed sold 40 aircraft to Japan through Clement, with a total price of $2.85 million. Clement should have received a commission of $385,000. Clement originally planned to sue Lockheed as well, but because the company had already paid $20,000, Clement withdrew the lawsuit against the company. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

### Spanish Bank Involved in Lawsuit in the United States: Sues Federal Bank, Court Rejects

(New York) The former Republican government of Spain sold silver worth $6.45 million to the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States. After the Nationalists won in Spain, the Spanish Bank wanted to claim this amount from the Federal Reserve Bank, and thus became involved in a lawsuit. The Federal Reserve Bank's lawyer argued in the New York State Federal Court that the Republican government was the legitimate government of Spain at the time, and that the purchase of silver and payment of the silver price by the Federal Reserve Bank was entirely legal. The court recently ruled to reject the Spanish Bank's complaint. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

### Political Cooperation Between Italy and Spain Will Be Materialized: Ciano Meets with Franco, etc., to Prepare for Formal Negotiations Between the Two Sides

(Madrid) After Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived in Spain, he held political, economic, and military talks with Nationalist government leader General Franco, Foreign Minister Jordana, and Interior Minister Suñer.

### Amidst the Turbulent Situation in Europe and Asia: The Question of World Peace and War: The Danzig Crisis Remains a Ticking Time Bomb; Göring Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the German-Italian Air Force; Unofficial Discussion in London on June 30th

London Airmail: The closer we watch the evolution of various objective situations, the more we cannot help but feel that today's world is indeed heading towards an inseparable, completely organic state day by day. For example, this question here:

"Peace or War?"

Broadly speaking, international wars have been going on in this world for several years, and the so-called "peace" has long disappeared. All countries in the world can be divided into only two major categories: those at war and those preparing for war. There is no such thing as "outsider," and certainly no "neutrality." However, if the term "war" only refers to actually participating in combat, as in the last World War, then this next world war has not yet officially begun. At this time, if there is a genuine determination to save world peace, then it still seems quite possible. However, there are undoubtedly only two paths to take: one is for countries determined to maintain peace to form an overwhelming dominant group, and with the determination to fight a war, cancel and remedy all the achievements of aggression in recent years, and forcibly stop those who are still aggressing. Then, future aggression will naturally disappear. Only then can the foundation of so-called peace be laid. Otherwise, take another path, which is for countries determined to maintain peace to cooperate thoroughly, emphasize the collective security system, and first defeat the aggressing countries. The remaining aggressor countries will naturally shrink back, and then it will be possible to further lay the foundation for the future peace of the world.

U.S. President Roosevelt's inquiry to Germany and Italy not long ago was, to some extent, following the first path. As for an example of the second path, we can cite the Soviet government's policy of aiding aggressed countries in recent years. Other than that, attempts to divide regions, deal with them individually, and break up the aggressor country groups have only resulted in falling into their trap of exploiting each other. As for the idea that they can be given enough satisfaction to stop them, it actually increases their desires. In the end, not only will it not save world peace, but it will promote the outbreak of a large-scale war.

However, when we review the recent progress of the international situation, we must admit that the evolution of objective facts has exceeded the control of subjective forces. So although there are the subjective efforts of the United States and Russia, the overall situation is developing closer and closer to the arrival of that great war day by day.

There is usually a specific term for this stage of the eve of the Great War, which is: "Crisis." Today's Europe is again filled with predictions of the arrival of another "crisis."

First of all, the repeated delays in cooperation negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have made Germany's actions appear particularly active recently. Hitler is putting all his efforts into planning how to prevent the formation of this alliance. We now know for sure that he has obtained firm commitments from the Baltic states in recent days: if Britain, France, and the Soviet Union automatically guarantee their independence and integrity, then they must first refuse, and even resist. If the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance had been formed two weeks ago, then it might not have been so rigid. The current situation is indeed a bit troublesome. However, based on the current situation alone, if the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance is formed immediately, then it can still be recovered with a little effort. What is worrying is Hitler's second conspiracy, which is that after the failure of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations, he plans to propose to the Soviet Union to jointly guarantee their security. Whether the Soviet Union will accept at that time is certainly a question, but based on the proposal itself, it does have an unparalleled allure for these weak countries.

If the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations continue to drag on without any results, then by around August 1st of this year, Germany will have 1.5 million troops mobilized. At that time, Hitler will immediately raise the demand to reclaim Danzig. Germany's plan is probably to first brew a separatist movement within Danzig, and then go with the flow, like Austria last year. As for the mobilization of 1.5 million troops, it is mainly to demonstrate to Poland and Britain and France. Up to now, although Britain has repeatedly warned Germany that if it uses force to threaten and make demands, Britain will never sit idly by. If Poland feels it necessary to resist, then Britain is prepared to fulfill the Anglo-Polish agreement and take joint action. At the same time, Poland has also repeatedly declared that it will never allow Danzig to be incorporated into Germany, and would rather fight if necessary. However, Germany absolutely does not believe these statements. It is determined that if all its estimates are correct, then when the time comes, the only path that Britain and Poland can take is probably to succumb. Therefore, Hitler intends to obtain Danzig before the annual Nazi Party Congress in September, as a diplomatic victory, and present it in his report.

We know that the crisis of seizing Danzig on April 29th was temporarily dismissed due to Mussolini's hesitation. Now, this plan, this conspiracy against Danzig, is of course also being discussed with Mussolini. What will Mussolini's next attitude be? From all sides, it does not seem to be certain yet. Not long ago, Mussolini specially instructed Ambassador Grandi to Britain to investigate Britain's possible reaction. Later, this Ambassador Grandi, known for his anti-British sentiments, immediately reported that, based on Britain's current attitude, it is bound to resist any aggression in Europe. When this report reached Rome, it was first seen by Foreign Minister Ciano. This Ciano, who is the strongest advocate of pro-German sentiment and a worshiper of Hitler, immediately dismissed the opinions in it and suppressed it, not letting Mussolini see it. It was not until recently, when Grandi returned to Rome, that he told Mussolini the details. This caused great dissatisfaction from Mussolini towards Ciano. Presumably, regarding the attitude towards this matter, there are still some differences between Mussolini and Ciano to this day.

In the past two days, the German troops have concentrated on the border with Poland, and the people of Europe are once again uneasy. However, judging from the situation, it does not seem that there will be a sudden attack in the short term.

Italy's conspiracy to invade British and French territories in Africa has recently had further concrete developments. Last week, Italian army and air force authorities held an important meeting with German authorities in Berlin to decide all future offensive plans.

We only know that the Italian air force representative was Aviation Minister General Valle, while the German representative was General Milch. Afterwards, it was rumored that in the event of a great war in the future, the commander-in-chief of the German-Italian joint air force had been decided to be General Göring, the dictator of Germany's "Four-Year Economic Plan." Moreover, it is said that a formal appointment has been issued.

The decided operational plan is probably to first attack Egypt in two routes, one starting from Italian Libya and the other starting from Abyssinia, with the final destination being the Suez Canal. At the same time as the attack on Egypt, there are two other armies departing from Gondar in Abyssinia, one attacking Kassala in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and the other attacking Khartoum. This plan was proposed by the German side.

However, some well-known military personnel in Italy opposed the above plan, such as General Balbo and General Badoglio. As for the biggest reason Germany put forward this plan, it is because the fortifications built by France in Tunisia are currently difficult to destroy, while Britain's preparations in Egypt are far from complete, so it is easier to win by attacking Egypt first.

At the same time as the above-mentioned invasion plan in Africa, various plans to contain Europe are also being accelerated. In northwestern Italy, along the foot of the Alps, towards France, a large number of technicians have been sent by Germany to help strengthen the fortifications. According to German estimates, in the event of a major war, the French army intends to break into Italy from here, so once this line of defense is connected to the German and Austrian lines of defense, then in a major war, at least in the short term, the British and French Allied forces will be unable to enter Eastern Europe by land to give assistance to Poland, Romania, Turkey, etc.

This line of defense reinforcement, in any case, will be completed by the end of July by Germany and Italy. By then, in the event that Germany raises the demand for Danzig, then it hopes to use this to warn Poland, implying the hopelessness of British and French aid, and that it is better to succumb to Germany.

What is even more indicative of the mutual support of aggressor groups is the close connection between Germany, Japan, and Italy recently. In the communication two weeks ago, the reporter pointed out that if Japan fails to deal with the Tianjin concession issue with Britain, then it will immediately join the German-Italian military alliance. Now we know that the actual situation is more than that. Recently, German Admiral Förste went to Japan on Hitler's orders to observe the possibility of Japanese soldiers promoting joining the German-Italian military alliance, and has already submitted a report to Hitler. His report can probably be divided into the following points: (1) Not only will it join the German-Italian alliance after failing to deal with the British concession issue, but it will definitely join even after victory. The reason is that in that way, it can restrain future British and French intervention once and for all. (2) According to the Japanese military authorities, there will probably be a final conclusion before mid-August. (3) Not only the British concession in Tianjin, but the Japanese military intends to abolish all existing foreign concessions throughout China, all of which are in the planning list. In the future, economic agreements will be signed by the Japanese military with Germany and Italy, with German and Italian economic trade replacing the past British, American, and French economies.

At the time when the reporter was writing this communication, it was when the British government intended to negotiate with Japan in Tokyo to resolve the Tianjin incident. Now, the entire British public opinion is in a state of resentment and suspicion towards the government. However, judging from the current situation, it seems that there is absolutely no room for compromise on the so-called "larger scope" issues.

Looking at the overall international situation, not only is the need for an Anglo-French-Soviet alliance very urgent, the need for the United States, Britain, and France to be in step is very urgent, but at this time, the need for further tacit understanding and cooperation between Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the more powerful allies standing between them, such as Poland, Turkey, and China, is also urgent.

All of this indicates that world peace is indivisible, and so is security.

### Manchuria is a Heavy Burden for Japan (Continued)

— Bo Ming

Numbers Are Hard to Trust

The warlords and their propagandists say: Japan's exports to Manchuria have increased. This is true; there are numbers to prove it. However, when these trade figures are used to indicate that Japan has profited from this, it reminds one of an old American saying: "Figures don't lie, but liars figure." Because the ordinary Chinese people of Manchuria are extremely poor and lack purchasing power, the Japanese exports of cotton goods and other materials for consumption by the Manchurian masses have indeed declined. The significant increase in Japan's exports to Manchuria is limited to certain special items, including railway and construction materials to meet the military and industrial needs of the warlords in the occupied areas. It also includes automobiles, wheat, flour, beer, fruits, etc., for the consumption of Japanese warlords or their subordinate staff. Although "luxury goods" have decreased sharply, the overall economic situation regarding trade relations between Manchuria and Japan remains unchanged. Whether the goods exported from Japan to Manchuria are for military and industrial use or for the personal enjoyment of the Japanese ruling class and Chinese puppets, the value is paid from the hundreds of millions of yen that Japan pours into Manchuria each year for military and "investment" purposes. The nature of the exported products makes this clear and beyond any doubt. They are mostly consumed by Japanese people in Manchuria in place of Japanese people in Japan, but the cost is borne by Japanese taxpayers who subsidize the warlords.

Even before the war south of the Great Wall in 1937, the terrible burden of Manchuria on the Japanese people was severely felt. Since Japan began its occupation of Manchuria in 1931, the burden of Manchuria has reached over 2 billion yen. The Japanese economy has shown serious strain due to this burden, but the warlords are engaged in the current war under this strained economy. Since the beginning of the war, the warlords' expenses in Manchuria have greatly increased due to the need to cope with the rebellions of the Chinese people in Manchuria, the entry of the Chinese Eighth Route Army, and the terrifying possibility of being struck by the Soviet Union. If Japan collapses this summer due to exhaustion, the reason will likely be that the warlords' occupation of Manchuria has placed an unsustainable burden on the shoulders of the Japanese people. This can be clearly understood by looking back at the past. (The End)

### Dinghai After the Occupation: A Scene of Desolation

Dinghai Correspondence: Dinghai is located east of Zhejiang and is a major production area for fisheries and salt in our country. Since it was occupied by the Japanese army on the 23rd of last month, all parties have been extremely concerned about the recent situation in Dinghai. The recent situation is described in detail below:

Miserable Market Conditions

In Dingcheng, all the major stores closed their doors and suspended business during the Japanese attack and evacuated to the suburbs. After the county town was occupied, the Japanese army forced the owners of the stores to return to the city and resume business as usual. Currently, among the stores in the city, the earliest to reopen was the Tongshoutai Sauce and Pickles Shop. The Jinchang Store at the front of the street has not yet resumed business because the partners and employees have taken refuge in Shanghai and Ningbo and have not yet returned. Currently, very few residents have returned to the city, so business in the stores is sluggish, and the market situation is extremely desolate, like a dead market.

Process of the Occupation

After Dinghai was occupied by the Japanese, a maintenance association was organized. The "chairman" is Ding Ziheng, the "vice-chairman" is a Mr. Chen, the "police chief" is Shen Kunquan, the "finance section chief" is Chen Songling, and the "transportation section chief" is Hu Hesheng. Chen Zizhen's son, Botang, and He Acang, etc., filled out certificates of good citizenship. Thugs Guo Ading, Xiao Jin, etc., have now been ordered to go to Daxie to try to cut off the sea route between Dinghai and Chuanshan. The address of the "Maintenance Association" is located at the former county government site. The fact that Dinghai fell in a few hours after the Japanese army's invasion was truly unexpected. According to sources, those who guided the Japanese army to invade were the son of Mr. Lu, the owner of the Xinyizhai Pharmacy in Nancheng, and a waiter from a certain hotel at the front of the street. They are all local hooligans. The private Zhoushan Junior High School in this county was founded by Liu Hongsheng. Its principal, Fang Tongyuan, is a Bachelor of Arts from Shanghai Hujiang University. He went to Japan in the autumn of the 23rd year to study education. In order to protect the school property, he was detained by the Japanese and forced to serve as a key member of the Maintenance Association. Later, Mr. Fang seized the opportunity to escape to Jintang and cross the sea to Ningbo. When he arrived in Ningbo, the military and political authorities detained him because he had served as a puppet. After Mr. Fang clarified the situation, he was released and took a car to Jinhua.

Terrible Burning and Killing

The Hongjia Ancestral Hall near Touqiao outside the North Gate of this city was previously the headquarters of the Dinghai County Engineering Communications Personnel Training Class and the location of the military telephone switchboard. Therefore, when the Japanese army searched the northern suburbs, they immediately set the ancestral hall on fire, burning it to ashes. Recently, it was heard that when the Japanese army searched Xiqiling outside the East Gate, they saw a bride who had taken refuge in the countryside and was very beautiful. The Japanese army wanted to rape her. When the bride saw this, she was terrified and fled. The Japanese army fired a shot and seriously injured her in the waist. Then they fired two more shots, and she was killed. Also, Jin Ayou, the owner of the Donggangpu Ice Factory, was shot and killed when he went to weigh ice with a scale.

Japanese Warships on Alert

Since the Japanese army occupied Dinghai, fearing that the Chinese army would counterattack by sea, they have mobilized Japanese warships from various places and stationed them in the Zhoushan Islands for defense. It is said that there are currently seven or eight ships stationed in the islands near Dinghai. Two ships are anchored near, one ship is anchored in the Yutang waters, one ship is anchored in the Mazhi waters, one ship is anchored in the Zhujiajian waters, two ships are anchored in Gaoting, Daishan, Dongshajiao, and other places, and one ship is anchored near Luomen. It is also said that there are six or seven seaplanes parked in front of the Minsheng Refined Salt Factory in Donggangpu. From this, it can be seen how afraid they are of guerrilla teams crossing the sea to counterattack.

### New Price Limit for National Rice: To Be Implemented Starting This Morning; Previous Transactions to Follow Original Prices; Any Transactions Exceeding the Price Limit Hereafter Will Not Be Considered Valid

The Bean and Rice Trade Association announced in the market yesterday morning: It has been found that the Shanghai Public Concession Engineering Bureau and the French Concession Public Bureau, in order to regulate the people's food supply, have convened representatives of this association to discuss the results and decided to continue to suppress rice prices. From today (transactions before July 15, 28th year will be calculated according to the original transaction price), whether wholesale or retail, the price of high-quality japonica rice must not exceed 20 yuan of national currency per stone, and the highest price of premium indica rice must not exceed 16 yuan of national currency per stone. The middle grades must be reduced accordingly. Any transaction exceeding the price limit by both the buyer and seller will not be considered valid, and real reports can be made to the police at any time for investigation and punishment. This announcement is urgently made to all colleagues in the industry to comply with the regulations in order to maintain the people's food supply. This is the announcement.

Invite Companies to Advise Compliance

The Bean and Rice Market Management Committee convened a meeting of representatives from 105 companies at the Qinglian Pavilion venue at 12:00 noon the day before yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Fu Qian'geng, Director of Market Management Committee. He first reported on the results of discussions with Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Zhang Nianxuan, and He De Kui, Deputy Director of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau. It was also decided that the new price limit for national rice would be implemented starting from the 17th, and all colleagues were expected to comply in order to avoid sanctions from the Concession authorities. However, transactions before July 15, 28th year will be calculated according to the original transaction price. If any transaction exceeds the price limit by both buyer and seller hereafter, it will not be considered valid.

Market Opening, Association Regular Meeting

Yesterday was the market's regular holiday on Sunday. The market will open at 9:00 this morning. It is heard that the Public Concession Engineering Bureau has assigned supervisors to station in the market to monitor the transactions of each company. Therefore, transactions after the market opens this morning will definitely be concluded below the new price limit. In addition, the Rice Trade Association will hold a joint executive and supervisory committee regular meeting at 3:00 this afternoon. In addition to discussing internal meetings, a report will be submitted on the new price limit agreed with the Concession authorities. Also, a reporter from Xin Sheng She interviewed a leader of the rice industry yesterday. According to him, there are more than 300,000 bags of rice stored in Shanghai, and this does not include the rice pre-purchased by residents. At the same time, rice stored inland is being transported to Shanghai one after another, and the time for new rice to enter the market is near. The overall food supply in Shanghai will definitely not be lacking.

### After the New Typhoon Landed, It Dissipated and Disappeared; The Local Climate Was Also Affected; The Atmospheric Pressure Increased, and Clear Weather Is Expected

The newly formed hurricane near Luzon Island landed in southern Fujian and Hainan the day before yesterday morning. At 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, it reached the vicinity of Qingyuan County in Zhejiang Province, 120 nautical miles west of Wenzhou. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's investigation yesterday morning, the hurricane has now shown signs of dispersion and disappearance. The weather in Shanghai yesterday morning was cloudy with occasional squalls and showers, which was affected by the dispersed and scattered hurricane. Therefore, Shanghai has been spared from being attacked. In addition, the atmospheric pressure in Shanghai is now trending upward, and the weather will improve.

### Financiers Talk About the New Subsidiary Currency Vouchers: The Printing Cost Should Increase the Paper Value; The Stabilization Fund Does Not Guarantee It

Since the copper-nickel subsidiary coins circulating in the market have been affected by a certain party's purchase and hoarding, members of the exchange and banknote exchange industries have tried their best to meet the needs of the market, but there is still an unavoidable shortage and panic. The Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank, under the order of the Ministry of Finance, has printed one-cent and five-cent subsidiary currency vouchers at the China Bookstore in Hong Kong. They will soon be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities for circulation.

Yesterday, a reporter from Daguang News Agency specifically consulted a giant in the financial community about the circulation of these vouchers. He was asked whether they would still be affected by hoarding and shortages in the future. Please give your opinion. According to him, the subsidiary currencies of our country used to be copper notes and copper coins. Later, because the prices of all goods rose sharply and the value of copper notes exceeded the value of copper in the notes, copper notes were abolished and only copper coins were used. Soon, copper coins were also affected by the above-mentioned factors. After the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan, the financial authorities cast new one-cent copper subsidiary coins and five-cent and one-dime nickel subsidiary coins. Until the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the prices of all goods soared again and again, so that the value of the copper subsidiary coins was less than twice the value of the copper in the coins. This coin is both an important raw material for military use and can achieve the economic goal of disrupting the daily needs of civilians.

Therefore, it was purchased and hoarded. Today, the competent authorities, Liu, are particularly able to understand the advantages and disadvantages of this problem. Therefore, they specifically issued new subsidiary currency vouchers for circulation. According to my opinion, when the Central Bank issues these new vouchers, the Ministry of Finance should increase the paper value of these one-cent and five-cent new vouchers as much as possible, preferably exceeding the currency value by three or four times. It is like the voucher clearly stating a currency value of one cent, but the cost price of the paper material is worth three or four cents. Each type of voucher clearly issues a currency value of one million yuan, but the cost would be three or four million yuan. In this way, for this loss-making business, it will naturally stop on its own. Moreover, these new vouchers are only limited to the occupied areas of Shanghai, and the Stabilization Committee will no longer guarantee them. They do not create problems for the international market and are the most wonderful preventive fortress. This is just a suggestion for reference.

### Unified Government Bonds: Payment to Begin at the End of the Month; Bondholders Should Fill Out Discount Certificates Application Form; Payment Method for Renaissance Bonds Has Also Been Determined

In order to maintain credit, the Ministry of Finance has consulted with the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong and agreed that the seventh installment of principal and interest on unified government bonds guaranteed by customs duties should be paid by discount. The Chongqing head offices of the three banks of Zhong, Zhong, and Jiao will pay in full, while Shanghai and other ports will pay in six installments. Although the official order has not arrived in Shanghai, the banking community has confirmed that this is a fact. Therefore, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has printed discount certificates and installment payment forms. It is stipulated that when bondholders apply for this installment of principal and interest, they should fill out the application form for discount certificates for the redemption of principal and interest on government bonds in detail, along with the matured principal and interest coupons, and submit them to the staff of the three banks of Zhong, Zhong, and Jiao for verification. They will immediately divide the actual amount paid for the winning bonds equally into six installments and fill them out in the blank space for the face value of the bond on the left side of the application form. It has been approved that payments will begin on July 31. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has also determined the method for the seventh installment of principal and interest on the Renaissance Bonds due at the end of August and the twelfth installment of principal and interest on the Long-Term Financial Bonds due at the end of September. Although the details of the method have not been announced, according to the reporter of Xinsheng News Agency, the method is roughly the same as the payment method for unified government bonds.

### Money Shop Funds: Supply Exceeds Demand; Exert All Available Resources; Strive to Protect National Goods

Since the member money shops in this city have completed the long-term transfer and loan interest settlement at the end of June, they will make every effort to lend to new and old customers who apply for new loans after careful consideration, so as to stabilize the market. They will exert all available resources to strive to protect the industrial and commercial industries that operate national goods. The rumor that new customers are refused loans is actually a misunderstanding of the refusal of commodity mortgage loans. It is heard that the various transfer and loan shops have thorough preparations for financial funds, and the current situation is that supply exceeds demand.

### After the Recovery of Zhangjiagang, Inland Waterways Resumed Navigation

Zhangjiagang in Jiangyin has been recovered by the Chinese army. The German merchant ship Changde has resumed sailing and is running smoothly. At the same time, the small steamship service from Zhangjiagang to the inland cities of Changzhou and Wuxi has also been restored. Passenger and cargo transportation is gradually becoming busy. The Italian merchant ships I.A. Nor, etc., have also joined the sailing, making passenger and cargo transportation to and from the inland areas more convenient.

### Shanghai-Yunnan Intermodal Transport: Convenient for Merchants; Developed Transportation

Passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and the inland provinces of Southwest China was changed to be transferred through the ports of Zhejiang and Fujian and Haifang after the outbreak of the war in South China. Currently, the ports of Zhejiang and Fujian have been repeatedly harassed by Japanese warships, and shipping has been affected and suspended. Goods to and from the inland areas have been concentrated in Haifang. Therefore, passenger and cargo transportation on the Haifang line is particularly prosperous. Foreign shipping companies find it difficult to transport goods to Haifang and then to the inland areas, causing goods to pile up like mountains in Haifang, and there is almost no space in the warehouses. Therefore, Shanghai-Yunnan intermodal transport has been implemented to alleviate the situation. Since its implementation, cargo transportation has been convenient, and transportation has therefore become increasingly developed.

### Inside Story of Shanghai's Drug Prohibition: What the Director of the Narcotics Department Said When He Resigned; Most of Shanghai's Narcotics Come from Tianjin

The Shanghai Times reported that Mr. Linte, Director of the Narcotics Department of the Public Concession Police, recently resigned and will leave Shanghai for Singapore at the beginning of this week. When interviewed by reporters, Lin stated that there were many things that he could not talk about in his position. However, Mr. Lin did reveal the details of the drug prohibition work. According to him, most of the opium, heroin, or any other narcotics seized in large quantities were seized based on information provided by crew members of ships carrying narcotics to Shanghai. The Narcotics Department of the Police has hired a large number of

Chinese and Foreign Secret Agents

Chinese detectives are mostly paid according to the results obtained from their intelligence. Some foreigners have fixed salaries. Mr. Lin then spoke of foreign parties engaged in narcotics trading in the past ten years or so, resulting in great wealth. These foreigners residing in this port are of different nationalities, with Central Europeans being the most numerous. The reporter asked how narcotics were

Transported to Shanghai

Mr. Lin replied that previously, these people transported them from Tianjin by rail, but since the outbreak of the war, they have been shipped in fake delivery boxes and suitcases. The general public believes that most of the manufactured opium comes from Shanghai, but this is not the case. Shanghai is only the sales center for narcotics trading in this part of the world.

Seized Opium Overseas

Constantly refers to Shanghai as its origin, but in fact, the source or origin of opium is Tianjin. Currently, the large amount of heroin being transported to the United States and being seized or already transported to the United States is being shipped from Hong Kong. An important feature of narcotics trading is that many carriers are completely innocent and may not even know that they are

Smuggling Narcotics

Groups that smuggle and sell narcotics often take many years to form, and those who wish to join must work as apprentices for many years before they gain their trust and are allowed to work internally. However, those who smuggle narcotics risk their own freedom and everything. It is said that there are those who continue to engage in this even after they have become wealthy.

### Japanese Warships Bomb Taizhou; More Than Twenty Japanese Warships Gather in the Waters of Pingtan Chuanshi

Cable from shipping industry in Shanghai, on the 15th at 8:00 AM, 3 Japanese warships appeared in the waters of Taizhou, Eastern Zhejiang and deployed speedboats, patrolling the coast and detaining several sailing vessels, and at 9:00 AM, they fired more than ten shots at the shore before leaving. The Japanese warships are testing the strength of the Chinese army and disturbing the rear. The Chinese army is heavily guarded along the coast of Haimen. On the 14th, 3 Japanese warships arrived in the waters of Zhenhai Ligang and left on the afternoon of the 15th. The situation along the coast of Eastern Zhejiang is peaceful.

Japanese Warships Attempt

Recently, the navigation industry received a cable stating that more than twenty Japanese warships have gathered in the waters of Pingtan Chuanshi in the Min River Estuary, deploying boats, patrolling and spying along the coast. The attempt of the strengthened joint defense between Fujian and Zhejiang is even more consolidated.

Shanghai-Ningbo Passengers

The Shanghai-Ningbo passenger transport cable has been approved by the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters and the military authorities, and forwarded to the Shanghai shipping company for notification. Passengers coming to Shanghai from Ningbo will continue to follow the regulations of the Provisional Measures for Navigation in Eastern Zhejiang for the issuance of travel permits. That is, young men leaving the country must have two stores as guarantors with more than 2,000 yuan, and they must return within a limited time. The elderly, young children, and women can be issued permits based on their household registration identity cards from the township offices. Merchants purchasing goods will still be transferred by the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce. Civil servants of various agencies and units will be issued permits by their original service agencies.

### Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet Will Return to Shanghai from North China Tomorrow; Coming to Shanghai to Greet the New Commander for Regular Turnover; Scheduled to Return to the U.S. Next Month to Meet President Roosevelt

Admiral Yuanar, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, has completed his three-year term and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on August 1 and go directly to Washington to meet with President Roosevelt. His new commander will be Rear Admiral Hull, former Chairman of the General Board of the Navy in Washington. Rear Admiral Hull departed from the U.S. on the President Coolidge on June 30 and stayed in Honolulu.

A Little Relaxation

He arrived in China on the President Coolidge on the 5th of this month to take over his post. Admiral Yuanar is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from North China on the U.S. ship Augusta tomorrow (the 18th) to greet the new commander. The ship will be docked at the head of the naval ship row in the Huangpu River, and it is stipulated that the

Handover Date

Will be the 25th of this month. A grand ceremony will be held on the rear deck of the flagship Augusta. First, Commander Yuanar will read the order, and then the duties of the fleet commander will be transferred to Rear Admiral Hull. Rear Admiral Hull will then read the order in front of the officers and men of the flagship, stating that he has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the military, and then the flag of Commander Yuanar

Will Be Removed

Replaced by the flag of Commander Hull. After Rear Admiral Hull takes over as commander of the Asiatic Fleet, he will be promoted to admiral. According to Rear Admiral Hull, he and Commander Yuanar are close friends. After taking over as commander of the Asiatic Fleet in Shanghai, he will continue to carry out Commander Yuanar's planned plans. When Rear Admiral Hull was in Honolulu, he praised Commander Yuanar for the

Difficulties Faced During the Sino-Japanese War

According to Hull, Hull was born in Davis, Michigan, U.S. in 1877 and is now 62 years old. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1929. In 1935, he served as Chairman of the General Board of the Navy in Washington.

Recently Resigned

He participated in two battles in the Spanish World War and has a good political record. General Hull's term as commander of the Asiatic Fleet will last until July 1, 1941, when General Hull will be 60 years old. As for Admiral Yuanar, after his resignation, he is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to the country on the President Coolidge on August 1, first going to Washington to meet with President Roosevelt to receive awards.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Releases Industrial Overview for June: Shortage of Raw Silk and Cocoons Is Worrying; Price Index Rises Again

Industry Meetings

A meeting of small light bulb factories was convened last month, and another meeting was held this month. Progress has been made in discussions on the standards that the industry should comply with. At the same time, a meeting of leather factories near the Fanhuangdu Station was also held. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to open a well in Ziliujing to be used as a public well for 13 leather factories. It has now been decided to open another meeting to discuss sedimentation ponds.

Accident Statistics

There were 175 industrial accidents, including nine fatal accidents and fourteen female workers injured. There were 45 accidents involving machinery, two of which were fatal, and fourteen female workers were injured. There were 12 accidents involving belts and linkages, and 7 accidents involving calendering machines, etc. There were 21 accidents in the transportation industry, with 32 workers falling and 26 being crushed. Five people were injured by electric shock, three of whom died. Seven people were injured by explosions, one of whom died. Five people were burned by molten metal, one of whom died. There were 22 factory fires, five of which were related to celluloid, with six injuries and two deaths. There were five fires in the weaving industry, with one injury. There were two fires each in the lumber, machinery, hardware, and food and beverage industries. There was one fire each in the house construction, chemical, clothing, and transportation industries, with a total of eight injuries and two deaths.

Cost of Living Index

The total index of workers' living expenses, based on the base of 100 in 1936, reached 176.15, setting a new record. It has continued to increase in the past seven months. This month's increase is 6.84% compared to last month and 15.48% compared to June of last year. Therefore, the reciprocal of this month's total index is 56.77. Therefore, the purchasing power of one yuan in 1936 is only worth 0.5677 yuan this month. Compared to last month, the classification is as follows: food increased by 10.94%, miscellaneous items increased by 6.03%, fuel increased by 3.82%, and clothing decreased by 4.21%.

Rice Price Comparison

The section also published a comparison of rice prices over the years. From 1864 to 192, the highest price of japonica rice was 3 yuan to 7 yuan per stone. In 1912, it rose to 9 yuan. In 1920, it rose to 13 yuan. In 1925, it rose to 18 yuan. In 1930, it rose to 23 yuan. The price limit in 1930 was 21. Although the current price limit is nominally the same as in 1930, due to changes in the market system, the current stone of rice is only 85% of what it was then. According to the calculation, the current price limit is actually equal to 24 yuan per stone in 1930. Usually, the rice price accounts for 23.31% of the total consumption of a worker's family. The difficulty of the lives of ordinary workers is evident.

### Contagious Diseases Are Gradually Rampant Among Jewish Refugees in North Suzhou Creek

The North China Daily News reported that two cases of scarlet fever and three cases of dysentery have been discovered in the Jewish refugee camp on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. Because the Zhaofeng Road Refugee Hospital is full, there are no isolation facilities available for these patients, so there is a risk of another contagious disease outbreak.

### Foreign Exchange Reserves Increase: Controlled Exports, Absorbed Overseas Remittances, Secured New Loans, Part of the Issuance Reserve Has Been Converted into Foreign Exchange

After the success of the National Government's legal tender policy, the legal tender reserve cash has always been guaranteed above 60%, while the guarantee is below 40%. It is checked monthly by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee to demonstrate its trustworthiness. However, before the war, this cash reserve was stored in the warehouses of major domestic banks. After the war, it has been transported to the UK and the US one after another, either entrusted to be kept in custody or exchanged for foreign exchange and deposited abroad. The current high number of issuance reserves is the highest in the world. Although it has been used to purchase necessary supplies for the war of resistance and maintain market relations, the foreign exchange position under the cash reserve is inevitably slightly reduced. However, due to government purchases and exports, the settlement of foreign exchange by exporters, the collection of gold and silver, the absorption of overseas remittances, and the establishment of new foreign loans, the foreign exchange reserves have been replenished and increased successively. As for the concerns that funds would flow into foreign banks after the restriction on withdrawals from Malayan dollars, because foreign commercial banks are not subject to the restrictions, the facts have proved that the above-mentioned situation has not occurred.

### Compulsory Military Service for British Nationals in Hong Kong and Shanghai: Rapid Turn of Events in the Far East, British Subjects of Military Age in Both Locations Must Not Evade Service, Hong Kong Government Order Reaches Shanghai

British nationals in Shanghai received an order from the Hong Kong government on the evening of the 15th regarding the conscription of British subjects of military age in Hong Kong, who have been ordered to participate in Hong Kong's defense work. Young British nationals in Shanghai must also serve and may not evade service. It is reported that the implementation of this compulsory military service aims to form a strong reserve force, similar in nature to the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. This emergency measure by the Hong Kong government is likely related to the rapid turn of events in the Far East.

According to a mainland newspaper, an informal source among British residents in Shanghai stated yesterday that British nationals in Shanghai may not be subject to the intensive training stipulated in this week's order from the Hong Kong government. This is because the strong and fit young British nationals in Shanghai have already joined the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and Shanghai lacks the facilities to accommodate long-term, continuous training for a large group. Moreover, in times of peace, British nationals in Shanghai and Hong Kong are governed differently. However, in the event of war, military law would, of course, be fairly applied to every British person fit for combat.

### Yu Qiaqing Advocates Developing the Petroleum Industry: Imports Exceed 100 Million Annually, Fluid from Zigong Contains Oily Components

Recently, Mr. Yu Qiaqing has been advocating for the development of the petroleum industry, issuing a statement to all sectors, stating that humanity is advancing daily, science is flourishing, the volume of production is increasing, and the needs of society are becoming more pressing. This is the evolution of the times to meet the balance of supply and demand. China is a historically long-standing agricultural nation, with natural resources that surpass all others in the world. Most of the raw materials needed by various countries are supplied by China. The provinces of Sichuan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Gansu are particularly rich in minerals. The saying "real treasures are like forests, and resources block the roads" is not an exaggeration. Westerners regard China as a land of gold, and there is a reason for this.

However, the widespread presence of gold has instead attracted the covetousness of ambitious individuals who plot against us day and night. In recent years, the government has been determined to strengthen the country, develop industry, and strive for production. Emerging industries are also springing up like bamboo shoots after rain, gradually reaching a point where they can compete with advanced countries. It is a pity that scientific progress has been slow, and inventions are few.

The petroleum needed for national defense, military supplies, and daily civilian use still relies on other countries, which is truly alarming. Originally, the petroleum industry was operated by American merchants. When it first entered China, it only met the fuel needs of the people. Later, with the development of industry, all the motive power of machinery relied on petroleum. The consumption was huge, and the economic losses increased. According to customs records,

The amount of imports exceeds 100 million annually. The magnitude of the figure and the amount of the leak are alarming. Mr. Yu Shunqing of Yin County has been studying petroleum, which is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, for many years. In the past, he did not shy away from difficulties and dangers, going to Sichuan four times to conduct on-site investigations. In the Zigong area, he discovered a large amount

of gas, a liquid with a black color and foul odor, originally regarded as waste by the locals. After several studies, it was confirmed to contain oily components. He immediately moved the raw materials back to Shanghai and asked Mr. Shen Xiongqing, a technician and director of the Industrial Testing Institute of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, to conduct a chemical analysis. The results were quite good, yielding gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil. A report and certificate were issued. Since he has obtained the benefits of natural resources, he should actively proceed. How can he give up due to a minor setback? Moreover, materials that are discarded can satisfy our

pressing needs, which is of great benefit to the country and a contribution to society. It is more than just plugging a leak. Furthermore, during this period of national crisis, regardless of light or heavy industry, everything is developing in the interior. Sichuan Province has always been known as the "Land of Abundance." Operating this industry here is suitable for both the time and the place. This is also an excellent opportunity for investors. I have heard that comrades are gathering to formulate plans

to engage in development, turning decay into magic, and building the country through production. I appreciate their ambition and support their success. I am happy to introduce them and hope that celebrities from the government and the public, as well as industrial experts, will rise up and contribute their talents and resources to achieve this goal as soon as possible. This may well be the dawn of self-reliance.

### Rubber Industry: Sales Improve, Factories Resume Operations, Five New Factories Established

Since Hankou, Guangzhou, and Nanchang successively fell, domestic sales of all national goods relied solely on eastern Zhejiang. After the implementation of the blockade of various seaports in Zhejiang, sales of national goods were limited to Shanghai. Therefore, the rubber industry reduced production. Now, as summer arrives and the Dragon Boat Festival approaches, sales of white sneakers and galoshes have shown a slight upturn. Therefore, various factories have increased production. Currently, the factories that are in operation include Da Zhonghua, Jiaotong, Da Shanghai, Minsheng, Guanghua, Huafeng, Yisheng, Hongda, Yongqin, Likang, Yuanyuan, Wuhua, Guotai, Yonghe, and Nanyang, a total of fifteen factories, an increase of five factories compared to last month.

### Portuguese Vessels Not Yet Returned, Crew Dismissed, China-America Navigation Company Also Implementing Reductions

Regarding the dozen or so Portuguese merchant ships that were previously seized because the Japanese side deemed their nationality unclear, and moored at Yangshupu's pontoon buoys, the former Portuguese Consul-General to Shanghai, Mr. Alves, and the new Consul, Mr. Melo, repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese Consul, Mr. Miura, and naval authorities. The situation had originally progressed, and there was considerable hope for their return. Yesterday, a reporter from Dagong News Agency learned from the shipping industry that the negotiations now seem to have stalled again. The seized vessels have not been returned. As a result, the various Portuguese shipping companies have been unable to maintain operations due to the suspension of business for more than three months. Most of the internal and shipboard staff, except for a few key personnel, have been temporarily dismissed with compensation to avoid excessive losses. In addition, the China-America Navigation Company, which represents Portuguese shipping interests, has also implemented reductions. Mr. Li Yaoting, the Chinese manager of the company, has resigned from the company to start his own Hong An Dyeing and Weaving Factory.

### Zhejiang Specialty Products Management Office Formulates Cocoon Merchant Registration Rules: Strict Management to Promote Production, Approved and Implemented by the Provincial Government

In order to strictly manage cocoon merchants and promote production, the Zhejiang Provincial Oil Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office has formulated Cocoon Merchant Registration Rules, which have been submitted to the Provincial Government for record and implementation. The rules are recorded as follows: (1) The Zhejiang Provincial Oil Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office formulates these rules specifically to manage cocoon merchants; (2) Before each cocoon harvest season, cocoon merchants should collect registration application forms from this office or various branch offices (the locations and registration dates of various branch offices will be announced separately), fill them out, and submit them to the respective branch offices for review and transfer. After being reviewed and approved by this office, a license will be issued before they are allowed to operate. Those who do not obtain a license must not operate without authorization. Those who violate this rule will be ordered to close down by the local administrative authorities. The registration form will be formulated separately. Cocoon merchants jointly established by the cocoon industry production cooperatives in various counties should also register in accordance with the provisions of these rules; (3) The establishment of cocoon merchants will be determined according to the following criteria: 1. The number of improved silkworm seeds distributed by the cocoon merchant is more than 2,000 sheets; 2. The output of fresh cocoons near the location of the cocoon merchant is more than 500 piculs; 3. The cocoon merchant has four or more double stoves; 4. The transportation in the location of the cocoon merchant is relatively convenient; 5. It is estimated that the cocoon merchant's cocoon collection and baking fees are sufficient to cover the minimum operating expenses; (4) All cocoon merchants approved to operate should repair and complete the stoves and all necessary equipment after receiving the license and submit the trade license fee to the county government, which will then transfer it to the Finance Department for verification and collection, and issue a business license; (5) Cocoon merchants shall adopt a contract baking system for cocoon collection. The minimum amount is calculated at 30 piculs of fresh cocoons per double stove, and the maximum amount shall not exceed 120 piculs of fresh cocoons per double stove; (6) The contract baking fee for fresh cocoons is calculated at 3.60 yuan per picul for each stove within 30 piculs. If it exceeds 30 piculs, the baking fee will be reduced by 0.20 yuan per picul for every additional 10 piculs, down to 2.40 yuan; (7) The maximum and minimum amounts of baked cocoons and the contract baking fees for machine stoves are calculated as ten double stoves; (8) Cocoon merchants should register once for each cocoon season, and no fees will be charged; (9) These rules will be implemented after being submitted by the Construction Department to the Provincial Government for record.

### Situation in Tianjin Still Deadlocked: Soviets Prevented from Coming to Shanghai: Even Shirts of Britons Were Removed, Food and Milk Supply Insufficient

According to a mainland newspaper, the Soviet Consul in Tianjin and two other Soviets were stopped by Japanese soldiers on the Hai River last Wednesday on their way from Tianjin to Tanggu and forced to leave the dock, unable to board Jardine Matheson's Taishun. Two of the Soviets intended to take the ship to Shanghai, while the Soviet Consul did not intend to come here, only accompanying the other two to board the ship. It is unknown whether the three returned directly to Tianjin or were detained by the Japanese army. This news was reported by a foreigner who arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin on the Taishun. The Taishun was delayed until 4:15 p.m. yesterday due to carrying a lot of cargo. According to other passengers on the ship, the situation in Tianjin is currently deadlocked, and everything has only slightly eased. A British national stated that when he entered the British Concession in Tianjin last Sunday, he saw a British resident's shirt being removed. The supply of fresh food and milk in the Tianjin Concession is completely insufficient, business is stagnant, and the general public is quite resentful of the situation.

### Stealing a Half-Day of Leisure: Collective Report: 1. A Midsummer Garden Scene

The summer climate is not necessarily annoying. If there are thin dark clouds in the sky, obscuring the scorching sun, and you stand under an ancient tree that can be embraced, you will definitely feel green all over and a coolness.

This kind of situation, like in Zhongshan Park in Beiping, can be encountered almost anytime. There are ancient cypresses with high ages, their branches and leaves interweaving, a green sky and green ground. Taking a walk in the early morning and afternoon, you will feel the loveliness of summer?

In Shanghai, not to mention the myriad of dust and noise, willing to choose reality, not yearning for the clouds of Mount Lu, nor is it necessary to say that there is nowhere to go. If you are not thinking of the bamboo of Mogan Mountain, you can take a trip to Zhaofeng Park in the western suburbs for half a day of leisure, and you will surely be able to temporarily cast aside all your troubles. Here there are small bridges and flowing water, ancient trees and pines, and even earthen mounds to climb.

Zhaofeng Park certainly cannot be compared with Zhongshan Park in Beiping. Each has its own strengths, without distinction. In my personal opinion, Zhongshan Park is quite ancient. Its special features are its cloisters, curved railings, and waterside pavilions, which are for "literati" to visit. A game of Go, plus a pot of scented tea, can be carefree and linger all day long. The characteristics of Zhaofeng Park lie in its gorgeousness, liveliness, flatness, and delicacy. Walking in a hurry, watching in a hurry, it does not allow you to be sluggish and linger, nor does it allow you to see everything at a glance. Although it has no ancient charm, it is just right.

Because everyone is feeling sad about the life of an isolated island every day, everyone is a little depressed. On the suggestion of Mr. S., we made a trip to Zhaofeng Park on Sunday and waited by the pool. We are all middle-aged people, but the active temperament of youth is still maintained to some extent. Sleeping late at midnight, we can still get up early, and everyone arrives at the scheduled time. So, carrying a camera case, we started walking.

It should start from when you enter the park gate. What is revealed in front of you is a curved, wide, and very long cement road. Looking around, the atmosphere of green makes people feel refreshed. Walking along the road, on the right is a winding small river, with duckweed and algae growing fully. On the left is a large green square, and in the center of the square is a very large pond. The grass on the bank of the pond is undulating, with weeping willows, evergreens, and a thatched pavilion. Chairs are placed casually around the riverbank for adults to sit and rest, and children are paddling boats on the pond. This is a contour of what you see after entering the park. If you describe it in detail, it would be a bit of a waste of ink! I will write about the wonderfulness of this park.

The wonderfulness of Zhaofeng Park lies in the slope of the grassland. Looking from a distance, it does not feel ordinary. Although the land is very wide and vast, it is mostly designed according to the natural terrain. There are several places with large trees, several places with small pavilions, and stone benches are arranged in the curved and secluded places. Even in some places, the grassland extends down the slope, and the eyesight is exhausted, and you cannot see the end at a glance.

Moreover, this park uniquely has many small paths. Surrounded by green shade, it seems that there is nowhere to go. Upon closer inspection, there is a pebble path. Although it is short, it is very poetic. If you linger on these small stone paths on a moonlit night, with the moonlight all over the ground, clear and quiet, you will definitely feel like you are not in this world.

Furthermore, although there is no running water in the park, there are also small streams running underground in secluded places, and small bridges are built on top. The construction of the bridge is very simple and elegant, all made of wooden sections. It is flat like a thoroughfare or raised like a hump, changing shape according to the location, appearing unconventional.

In the western part of the park, a new earthen mound was built. From the bottom to the top, it is dozens of steps large, all paved with stone steps and planted with green bamboo, like the Taoguang Bamboo Path in Hangzhou. We looked out from the top of the mountain for a long time, and the green trees, thatched pavilions, the reflection of the waves and clouds were all in full view, with the charm of a misty landscape.

After wandering like this for half a day, it is truly what is called walking in a hurry and watching in a hurry, experiencing the coolness of summer under ancient pines like Zhang Hua's canopy. Everyone also thought of the ancient cypresses in Zhongshan Park in Beiping; what is gratifying is that we are not disappointed, we all have the confidence to travel north together, it is not a hopeless thing.

The teacher said: Dreams may be realised. We are not in a dream, why not step on the path of light? (Jingxing)

### Delay in Voyage of Two Mail Ships Due to Hurricane, "Glarisrona" Arrives Three Hours Late, "Tjitaroem" Departure Postponed

The "Glarisrona" (transliterated), a mail ship managed by Melchers & Co. and belonging to Norddeutscher Lloyd, departed from Bremen, Germany, and was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday.

### Famous Female Peking Opera Singer Xue Youqin's Costumes and Jewelry Stolen, Her Stage Assistant Guan Wanyou's Bad Behavior and Unrepentant Nature Leads to Six Months' Imprisonment

Guan Wanyou, a native of Beiping who was the stage assistant for the famous female Peking opera singer Xue Youqin, had served her for many years, managing all of Xue's costumes and props. In recent years, Guan's behavior had deteriorated. He once stole items belonging to his mistress, and after Xue berated him, he had friends and relatives intercede on his behalf. He begged for forgiveness and promised to reform, so Xue allowed him to continue working as before. However, Guan's

thieving heart resurfaced, and he secretly stole items for pawn. Xue did not notice at first, but on the evening of the 12th of this month, while Xue was putting on makeup backstage at the Tianchan Theatre, she asked Guan to fetch a mirror. However, Guan had already pawned the mirror at the Changsheng Pawnshop during the day, so he could not provide it. After Guan stammered an explanation, Xue still did not suspect that he had stolen it. However, Guan felt guilty and dared not linger. While his mistress was performing on stage, he quietly fled. Later,

Xue finished singing and returned to her residence at No. 4 Renheli, Guling Road. Not seeing Guan return all night, she became suspicious. She checked the items he was managing and found that 67 costumes, 5 knives, 1 sword, 10 silver ornaments, and 7 steel items were missing, totaling a value of a thousand gold. It must have been Guan who stole them. She searched in all directions but found no clues. The next day at dusk, Xue's relative Zhai Shuliang passed by Ma Hall Road and unexpectedly encountered Guan. Zhai already knew that Guan had stolen his mistress's belongings and fled, so he called the police.

Guan was taken into the News Police Station. Under investigation, Guan admitted that he had started stealing costumes on February 11th of this year, pawning them at the Dechang Pawnshop on Parker Road a total of 34 times, receiving over 210 yuan in pawn money. All the pawn tickets were still preserved. The head detective immediately ordered the surrender of the pawn tickets and sent Deputy Detective Li Shizhong and Detective Yang Feizhang to recover the stolen goods. The day before yesterday, Guan was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court, where Magistrate Meng Tingke interrogated him. Xue was also summoned

to confront him. After the actress explained the case to the police station's lawyer Qian Xunjiu, she recounted the defendant's past behavior and the facts of this theft and escape. However, Guan Wanyou claimed that he stole because his mistress owed him wages. Xue then supplemented her statement, saying that Guan indeed owed her money and she had not shorted his salary. Guan then lowered his head and remained silent. The court immediately sentenced Guan to six months' imprisonment, and the stolen goods were to be redeemed by the owner at her own expense.

### Japanese Army Joins Forces with French Police to Search for Days

A Hotel Room in Great Shanghai Searched, Traveler Out, Nothing Found

At 4:00 AM yesterday, more than ten Japanese personnel went to the French Police Department, requesting them to send Chinese and Western detectives to assist in searching Room 8230 of the Great Shanghai Hotel on East Xinqiao, Avenue Edward VII. It happened that the guest in that room had gone out the night before and had not returned, so nothing was found. After the search, no prohibited items were found either.

### Stroke While Playing Mahjong, Dies Laughing

Ye Huajin, an 18-year-old native of Wuxi, lived at No. 26, Lane 886, Jiaozhou Road, Shanghai West, earning a living nearby. Last night, he invited friends to play mahjong at home for entertainment. Around 10:00 PM, Ye drew a card and completed a hand with all one suit, getting rich with a matched pong of middle. He was extremely happy. Later, he drew another card, and as he pushed the tiles down, he laughed once and immediately fell to the ground and died. His friends were greatly alarmed and quickly called a car to take him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor, it was found that there was no way to save him, and the body was transferred to the coroner's office for an autopsy.

### Continued Interrogation of Extortion of School Principal

Xu Hao, a native of Jiading who served as a teacher at Hengmao Elementary School at No. 87, Hengmao Lane, Baixianqiao, recently colluded with Yao Tingsen, a local who worked in the Public Concession Police Department on Jing'an Temple Road, and Yue Qiuxin, a Cantonese, claiming that the school principal Yang Guoping had not obtained a permit from the French Municipal Council and had privately built a four-story loft in the school. They impersonated officials from the donation department of the French Municipal Council and extorted 1,000 gold from Yang. After the incident was exposed, Yao and others were arrested and transferred to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday was another scheduled continuation of the trial. The plaintiff Yang Guoping hired a lawyer to appear in court and requested an incidental civil suit for 370 yuan. However, the police record stated that the investigation was not yet complete and requested a further extension. After reviewing the statements, the court summoned each defendant for questioning and then adjourned the hearing to the 19th of this month.

### Two Hand Grenades Found at Asia Petroleum Station on Nanjing Road, Workers Discovered Them, Fortunately Did Not Explode, Truth of Placement Under Investigation

At approximately 6:00 AM yesterday, two hand grenades were found abandoned in the open space of the Asia Petroleum Station at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road. Fortunately, they did not explode. The hand grenades all had wooden handles, resembling taro, and were black. They were placed in the open space about a foot away from the petroleum. The first to discover them was Xue Ergen, a worker at the station. When he rode his bicycle to the station to take over the shift, he caught sight of the explosives and immediately informed Hua Bu No. 21. Hua Bu No. 21 relayed to the Central Police Station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene and take away the two hand grenades. The intention of the person who placed the grenades is still unknown. The police authorities are currently investigating the source and truth of the hand grenades.

### Scheme to Alter Check for Fraudulent Withdrawal, Bank Clerk Unrelated, Zhou Liankui Granted Release

Recently, the China Industrial Bank at the intersection of Beijing Road and Jiangxi Road discovered that someone had altered a check of the Yongxin Linen Weaving Company, an account that had already been canceled, and forged the signature and seal of another account holder, Ge Yanqing, fraudulently withdrawing 300 yuan of national currency. When Ge tried to withdraw money, the bank returned it, claiming insufficient funds. After Ge negotiated with the bank, the bank manager Wang Boyuan reported it to the General Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng and Detective Qian Xianting, they believed that Zhou Liankui, a Ningbo native and employee of the bank, was suspected and arrested him, transferring him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The details have already been recorded in this newspaper. Now, after investigation by the police station, it was determined that there was no conclusive evidence of Zhou's involvement in the case. Therefore, the police station's lawyer Jiang Baolian applied to the First Special Court to stop the detention of Zhou Liankui and release him. After deliberation, Magistrate Feng Shide ordered that Zhou Liankui be granted release from detention.

### Female Servant Convicted of Theft

Mr. Wang, the main character in a comedy film in the movie industry, 39 years old, a native of Nanjing, lives at No. 6, Lane 383, Ladu Road, French Concession. Recently, a newly hired maid, surnamed Wang, seized the opportunity to steal all of Tang's ordinary and filming suits, worth over 100 yuan, and pawned them for use. After Tang discovered it, he reported it to the French Police Department, and Detective Gao Jinsheng arrested Wang and recovered the stolen goods. The day before yesterday, she was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police station's lawyer prosecuted according to the law. The plaintiff Tang Jie appeared in court to recount the theft and the circumstances of the discovery. When questioned, Wang pleaded guilty.

### Bank Accountant Embezzles Over 40,000 Yuan, Exploits Water Sprinkling and Transfers for Profit, Ultimately Losing Everything in Gambling Den, Sentencing Scheduled

Fang Xile, a Cantonese employee of the accounting department of the Dandong Bank at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Jiangxi Road, was addicted to gambling, resulting in insufficient income. He devised a way to embezzle funds. His method of embezzlement involved cases where depositors entrusted the bank to remit money abroad. Assuming that the money remitted at the time of remittance was equivalent to 100 yuan in Chinese currency based on the foreign currency exchange rate, and by the time of settlement, due to changes in market prices, the exchange rate required 130 yuan in Chinese currency, the bank would charge the customer based on 130 yuan. The bank would then have a surplus of 30 yuan. Fang, by virtue of his position, took this surplus for himself. In this way, over the years, Fang embezzled no less than tens of thousands of gold, but lost it all in gambling dens. Recently, Fang's fraudulent activities were discovered by the bank, and they reported it to the Silk Patrol Police Station. Chinese Detectives Jiang Shangpei and Yang Peisheng arrested Fang and transferred him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Magistrate Feng Shide opened the First Criminal Court for continued interrogation. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that he was now prosecuting based on Article 336 of the Criminal Law for fraud and Article 217 for forgery. According to the investigation, Fang embezzled a total of over 40,000 yuan, and should be punished according to the law. Fang also hired lawyer Rong Zhenlong to defend him, but he did not dispute the accusations. After detailed questioning by the court, he ordered the lawyers of both parties to begin their arguments, announced the conclusion, and scheduled the sentencing for next Thursday.

### Appeal of Monk Murder Case Concluded, Awaiting Judgment

It was reported to the Putuo Road Police Station, which detained him and transferred him to the First Special Court, prosecuting him for attempted murder. After questioning by Magistrate Huang Risheng, Zhao Kong was sentenced to five years and six months' imprisonment, and the poison was confiscated. Zhao Kong was dissatisfied with the sentence and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, Court President Yu opened the court to conclude the trial, and the sentencing was scheduled for the 21st of this month.

### Shi Chenglang Acquitted in Fire That Killed Three Children

Shi Chenglang, the cook, was arrested on suspicion and transferred to the First Special Court, which sentenced him to one year and two months' imprisonment. Shi was dissatisfied with the sentence, and his pro bono lawyer Wang Xiaowen drafted an appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court on his behalf. After investigation and conclusion by Court President Yu, the original judgment was overturned, and Shi Chenglang was acquitted.

### Suicide Attempts

Apprentice Hangs Himself Wei Yongsen, an 18-year-old local apprentice at Yuanchang Pawnshop at No. 1740 North Shansi Road, Public Concession, had an argument with another apprentice at approximately 3:50 PM yesterday, which escalated into a physical fight. After mediation, the matter was resolved. However, Jiang was stubborn and became despondent. He took the opportunity to enter the room and hang himself. He was discovered by someone, who quickly tried to save him, but he was already barely breathing. It was reported to the Huisi Police Station, which ordered Patrolman No. 158 to rush to the scene and call an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was said that he had been hanging for too long and his life was in danger.

Student Takes Poison Xia Shicai, a 22-year-old Shanghai native residing at No. 3, Lane 277, Wenlin Road, French Concession, was a student at a certain middle school. For unknown reasons, he swallowed medicine and attempted suicide at approximately 8:00 PM last night. He was discovered by his family and taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. His poisoning was severe, and his life was in critical condition.

Indignant Young Woman Commits Suicide Jiang Xingqin, a 25-year-old woman with deceased parents, currently lives in the front building at No. 59 Beijie, Xujiahui Town. Her husband, Hu Zhifu, also known as Zhang Di, is a businessman who occasionally comes to Shanghai. Her aunt, Zhang, is very fierce, so Jiang is often abused. As a result, the aunt and daughter-in-law live separately. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, Zhang came to scold her again. Overcome with resentment, Xingqin became despondent and secretly purchased opium to commit suicide at approximately 4:00 PM in the afternoon. She was discovered by her housemate and rushed to Yanci Hospital for treatment. It was reported that she had ingested a large amount of poison and her life was in danger.

Woman Hangs Herself Shen Qian, a 48-year-old local woman, lives at No. 14, Xinyu Lane, Zhuanbang, Shanghai West. Recently, her husband lost his job, and her son was ill with no money for medical treatment, causing her great anxiety. She became despondent and secretly hanged herself in the room in the front. By the time her family discovered her and tried to save her, her body was already cold as ice, and there was no way to revive her.

Unable to Live On Cheng Biao Wang A'gen, a 22-year-old Shanghai native residing at No. 91 Jiaofan Village, Lane 877 Foch Road, became despondent due to economic pressure. At 4:00 PM on the 15th, he went to the Chujiang Third Inn at No. 10 Xinqiao Street, French Concession, booked Room 63, and swallowed medicine to commit suicide. At midnight, the teahouse attendant discovered him and reported it to the sweepers. He was taken to Guangci Hospital by car, but the treatment was ineffective. He died yesterday afternoon. The police took the body to the coroner's office for an autopsy.

### Angered by Wife's Affair, Splashes Acid and is Arrested, Husband Instigates Fellow Townsman to Harm Lover, Backfires, Husband Also Arrested

Shi Biao, a 36-year-old merchant from Chongming, lives in the garage at No. 682 Rue Massenet. Shi's wife, Jin, is 32 years old and has some looks, but is naturally flirtatious. Recently, she had an affair with Lu Shangxian (36 years old), a fellow townsman who works as a comprador at No. 108, Room 1, Gōngsìfáng Building 455, Avenue Lafayette.

A month ago, while Lu and Jin were walking hand-in-hand on the street, they were spotted by Shi Biao, who slapped Jin twice on the spot. Afterwards, Shi often quarreled with and beat Jin. At the same time, he hated Lu to the bone and thought of revenge. Until recently, Shi instigated his fellow townsman Ni Afang (35 years old, who runs a butcher shop at No. 59 Xicheng Lane, Route Massenet) to use

acid to harm

Lu Shangxian. Three days ago, Shi gave Ni five yuan to buy a bottle of acid. At approximately 5:00 AM yesterday morning, Ni used a teacup to fill it with acid and lay in wait next to the toilet inside No. 455, where Lu lived, because Shi knew that Lu would definitely go to the toilet around 5:00 AM in the morning, so he instructed Ni to lie in wait there. When the time came,

Lu indeed arrived.

At 5:30, Lu went to the toilet. Just as he was stepping out, Ni rushed up, ready to raise the cup and splash it on Lu's face, but Lu was quick-witted and used his left hand to block. At this time, Ni was flustered, and all the acid in the cup spilled on his own face, causing severe burns. Lu immediately called the police on the spot

and arrested Ni, taking him to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, Ni confessed that Shi Biao was the instigator. They then arrested Shi and sent Ni to the hospital, awaiting his recovery before sending him to court for trial.

### Fake "Political Affairs Office" in Nanshi Organizes Housing Registration, Charging One to Five Yuan Per Building, All Businesses Ignore It

According to people from Nanshi, the fake "Municipal Government," facing financial difficulties, organized a "Land Registration" last year, but as a result of public non-cooperation with the fake authorities, the matter came to nothing. It is learned that the fake authorities, facing financial difficulties and having exhausted all means, the fake "Political Affairs Office" in Nanshi is again organizing "Housing Registration," charging from one to five yuan per building. However, the public still ignores it. After the war, thieves are rampant in Nanshi, and now they are stealing and robbing everywhere, so they are forming groups to privately dismantle houses, selling the bricks and tiles. When the owners report to the fake "police station," the "police station" first asks if they have registered the "Housing," and if they have not "registered," the "police station" says that it will not provide protection.

### Yesterday Morning Robbery on Xin Zha Road: Bandits Opened Fire, Resisting Arrest; Result: One Bandit Captured, Firearm Seized; Discovery that the Firearm Belonged to the Police Makes Case Extremely Important

Yesterday morning, around 4:45 AM, a store located at 867 Xin Zha Road was suddenly targeted by a lone bandit carrying a handgun. The bandit barged in and robbed the store of legal tender and pawn tickets before fleeing. Nearby patrol officers, upon hearing the alarm, immediately pursued the bandit while sounding their whistles. The bandit dared to open fire to resist arrest, firing and fleeing along the way. Police officers returned fire. The bandit fled to Lane 464, Shanhaiguan Road, where he was finally captured by Chinese officers. A handgun and two bullets were seized. After investigation, the handgun was identified as a service pistol belonging to the Public Concession Police Department, serial number 559. Police authorities are taking this case very seriously and are currently conducting a thorough investigation.

According to information gathered by our reporter after the incident, the weapon seized from the captured perpetrator was confirmed by the police investigation to be the same service pistol, number 1670, belonging to the Chinese police officer of the Huizi police station who was fatally attacked with an axe on July 13 while on duty at the Guangdong Refugee Shelter at 834 Peng Road. The pistol had been taken by the assailant at that time. Therefore, the captured perpetrator in this case may be significantly related to the previous case, and a careful and thorough investigation is currently underway.

### Mock Election Ticket Exhibition Concludes

The Sino-Foreign Mock Election Ticket Exhibition, organized by the Beijing Road Money Exchange Association of this city, has been open for a week. More than 16,000 Chinese and foreign visitors attended. Even during the heavy rain and wind on the 12th, people continued to arrive by car in an endless stream, demonstrating the significance of the event. As the original scheduled time has expired, and other work of the association urgently needs to be carried out, the exhibition was closed last night. It is also reported that this decision was made because the association's premises were too small, causing the guests to be very crowded, and the reception was inadequate, which was quite regrettable. Once the weather cools down in the autumn, the association will hold another side-by-side exhibition of genuine and fake election tickets at a suitable venue, and preparations are currently underway.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: We are writing on behalf of our client, Dr. Xu Daoren, who has informed us that the news item in the local news section of the Shen Bao on the 15th of this month, titled "Second Landlord Evicts Third Tenant," contains many inaccuracies. The front and rear buildings at 7 Ruian Lane, Maybaik Road, Xin Zha Road, were rented to a third tenant, Bi Wanshi, for a monthly rent of 35 yuan (20 yuan for the front building and 15 yuan for the rear building) when the Xu family evacuated to the countryside during the outbreak of the Shanghai war. Bi was notified three months ago that the property would be reclaimed for personal use. Bi has now moved back to his hometown in Pudong, and the lease has legally ended. Therefore, the fourth tenant, Pan Zhishan, has no lease relationship with me, so how could he forcibly occupy the house? I reported this to the Xin Zha police station and ordered his removal. Pan Zhishan asked someone to plead on his behalf, and I gave him one and a half months to move out. There was no "dispatch of detectives to investigate and await verification," etc. Therefore, we specially request your newspaper to publish this letter in the "Letter to the Editor" column to clarify the situation and correct the record. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Lawyer Mi Xitong, to the Local News Section of the Shen Bao.

### Overview of National University Curriculum (Part 1): Curriculum, Except for Medical Schools, is Set by Each School, Resulting in Diverse, Repetitive, and Disorganized Subjects

(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The Ministry of Education recently compiled a detailed statistical overview of the curriculum of colleges and universities nationwide. The following is the information regarding the university curriculum:

In the past decade or so, the university curriculum, except for medical schools, has been set by each school. With so many departments and schools, and without consistent standards, the subjects have become diverse, repetitive, disorganized, and uneven in level. This situation can be seen from the statistics of the subjects offered by universities nationwide. In 1935, the Ministry of Education compiled and arranged the subjects listed in the overviews and course descriptions of excellent universities in the country, and produced a comparative table of required and elective subjects by department. The statistics were based on the same subject in each department, as follows:

Chinese Literature Department: 20 schools surveyed (abbreviated as "schools" below), 126 required subjects (abbreviated as "required" below), 134 elective subjects (abbreviated as "elective" below), 260 total required and elective subjects (abbreviated as "total" below). Foreign Literature Department: 21 schools, 69 required, elective details unknown. History Department: 11 schools, 79 required, 60 elective, 139 total. Philosophy Department: 7 schools, 49 required, 94 elective, 143 total. Education Department: 12 schools, 57 required, elective details unknown. Physics Department: 19 schools, 81 required, 90 elective, 171 total. Chemistry Department: 15 schools, 98 required, 84 elective, 182 total. Biology Department: 18 schools, 91 required, 65 elective, 156 total. Mathematics Department: 0 schools, 82 required, 92 elective, 174 total. Geography Department: 3 schools, 55 required, 48 elective, 103 total. Psychology Department: 3 schools, 32 required, elective details unknown. Sociology Department: 7 schools, 66 required, 74 elective, 140 total. Law Department: 27 schools, 108 required, 73 elective, 181 total. Political Science Department: 15 schools, 152 required, 241 elective, 393 total. Economics Department: 13 schools, 110 required, 230 elective, 340 total. Civil Engineering Department: 14 schools, 139 required, 45 elective, 184 total. Electrical Engineering Department: 9 schools, 86 required, 37 elective, 103 total. Chemical Engineering Department: 7 schools, 104 required, 24 elective, 128 total. Mechanical Engineering Department: 11 schools, 104 required, 25 elective, 129 total. Agronomy Department: 14 schools, 105 required, 37 elective, 142 total. Animal Husbandry Department: 10 schools, 103 required, 8 elective, 111 total. Agricultural Administration Department: 2 schools, 62 required, 15 elective, 77 total. Agricultural Economics Department: 6 schools, 63 required, 29 elective, 91 total. Agricultural Chemistry Department: 4 schools, 78 required, 20 elective, 98 total. Sericulture Department: 10 schools, 79 required, 16 elective, 95 total. Banking Department: 8 schools, 101 required, 75 elective, 186 total. Accounting Department: 8 schools, 91 required, 66 elective, 157 total. International Trade Department: 3 schools, 66 required, 33 elective, 99 total. Business Administration Department: 6 schools, 97 required, 61 elective, 168 total.

Although the number of schools on which the above statistics of each department are based is not uniform, ranging from 25 to 2 schools, it can be seen here that the subjects offered are complex. The statistics of each department range from as many as 393 subjects in the Law Department to as few as 77 subjects in the Agricultural Administration Department. This is because the statistics of the Agricultural Administration Department are based on only two schools. The more schools that contribute to the data, the greater the total number of subjects. This is an important manifestation of the diversity and complexity of the subjects offered by each school. Furthermore, an analysis of the content of each school's curriculum reveals the following phenomena:

(1) Inconsistent Common Required Subjects: University regulations and the National Physical Education Law stipulate that the common required subjects for universities are: Party Ideology, Chinese Language, Physical Education, Military Training, and First and Second Foreign Languages. Each school should set up these subjects uniformly. However, in reality, some schools lack one, two, or even three of these subjects. Taking the College of Science as an example, out of 20 schools, only half offer Party Ideology, 16 offer Chinese Language, 19 offer English, 6 offer Physical Education, 11 offer Military Training, and 3 offer a Second Foreign Language. In the College of Engineering, out of 14 schools, only 5 offer Party Ideology, 9 offer Chinese Language, 13 offer English, 3 offer Physical Education, 6 offer Military Training, and 5 offer a Second Foreign Language. In the College of Law, out of 17 schools, 8 offer Party Ideology, 10 offer Chinese Language, 11 offer English, 8 offer Military Training, 1 offers General Physical Education, and 5 offer a Second Foreign Language.

### Jiangsu Education Department Plans for High School Students' Further Education

(Xinghua Correspondence) The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department is preparing for the upcoming summer vacation, when the issue of students' further education will need to be addressed in view of the large number of middle schools in the province. The Ministry of Education has been requested by telegram to instruct national universities in Shanghai to expand their enrollment and increase the number of classes in order to accommodate students. In order to facilitate students who wish to go to the rear, a recruiting office has been requested to be set up in Shanghai according to last year's precedent. The ministry is also requested to subsidize the travel expenses of admitted students westward for relief. The Ministry of Education has recently replied by telegram that it will set up a recruiting office in Shanghai for unified enrollment this year. If the quotas of Shanghai schools are full, students will be assigned to schools in the rear based on their grades and preferences. The travel expenses are being planned. It is reported that the Education Department has already issued a notice.

### Change of Principals in Taizhou Schools; Provincial Yangzhou Middle School Taizhou Branch to Move to Shanghai; Reorganization of the Board of Directors of Shimin Middle School

(Taixian Correspondence) Chen Dehong, the principal of Taixian County Middle School, has resigned for personal reasons, which has been approved. The Taixian Education Bureau previously recommended three people for the Education Department to select. The county government has now received instructions to appoint Mr. Li, the former director of moral education at the school. After the Education Bureau issues the appointment order, he will begin recruiting students.

The Provincial Yangzhou Middle School Taixian Branch, originally located at the former site of the Mingde Girls' School in Dajiaochang, will move to Shanghai in the next semester and merge with Taizhou School Branch of Yangzhou Middle School because the owner of the original building needs to take it back and it is not easy to find a suitable school site at the moment.

Taixian Private Shimin Middle School has been operating for a long time. In recent years, due to poor management, the Education Department has instructed the school to reorganize its board of directors. Lu Xiaobo has been publicly elected as the chairman of the board of directors, and local people who are enthusiastic about education have been appointed as directors. The school board is currently looking for suitable talent to serve as principal.

### YMCA Boys' Department Summer Service for Refugee Children to Commence Soon

The Boys' Department of the Shanghai Chinese YMCA is utilizing the summer vacation to train outstanding YMCA members to promote the movement to serve refugee children, in order to assist in the educational activities of various shelters, improve the daily living habits of refugee children, and at the same time enable YMCA members to understand the meaning of their service and improve their service effectiveness. The association originally scheduled the service movement to begin on the 10th of this month, but because the Education and Health Movement Week also opened on that day, YMCA members went to various places to promote health knowledge, so it was not possible to realize it on schedule. Now that the association's Education and Health Movement Week has ended yesterday, the summer service for refugee children movement will soon follow.

### Yesterday's Private Shanghai Cup Basketball: Tiger Team Loses Again, Strong Teams Also Win Big; Today Ning Shao Battles

In the Private Shanghai Cup basketball tournament, yesterday's cup featured a fierce battle between Zhongchu and Zhiqiang, with Zhongchu narrowly winning by one point, making the situation extremely tense. The matches between Qiu Zuyi team and Qun Yi, as well as between Zhongzu Huafan and Shangwu, were also quite close. In the women's group, Qing Bai Hong's victory over Haiguang, and in the men's group, Qianghua's victory over the Tiger Team, both became one-sided. The Tiger Team was quite active yesterday, a stark contrast to their performance against Hualian the day before. Xi Jiaode and Shen Yigu both attacked and defended, showing promise, but Qianghua was more experienced. Xu Tiankui and Zhang Shao Xiang watched from the sidelines, executing their strategies skillfully. After Shen Yigu of the Tiger Team broke the deadlock, Xu and Zhang issued order after order, completing a 16-2 run in one go, deflating the Tiger Team's momentum. Although the Tiger Team briefly revived its spirit, it ultimately succumbed. The first half ended with Qianghua leading 36-19. The final score was 72-38. Yesterday, Xu Wenkui scored 15 points alone, and Zhang Shaoqing scored 20 points, demonstrating Qianghua's strong performance. Today's five matches include two in the women's group, one in Group A, and two in Group B, including Tianxing vs. Qingyou, and Ningshao vs. Pengbi.

### Faber Cup Final Second Leg: Lido and Samsung Draw; 1-1, No Score in the First Half; The Two Teams Will Play the Final Match This Weekend

The second leg of the Faber Cup Group A final, Lido vs. Samsung, was held yesterday afternoon at the Sino-French Stadium on Albert Road. The audience was as crowded as in the first match, with nearly a thousand people. Lido won the first leg 2-0. If they could win yesterday's match, they would win the championship. However, Samsung played exceptionally hard yesterday, and their attacks dominated Lido's goal for three-fifths of the game. However, Lido's defense was impenetrable, and they could not score. Although Jin Peigen once attacked the center directly, Zhang Mingsheng returned the favor, resulting in a 1-1 draw. According to the rules, extra time should have been played, but both sides agreed not to, and the winner will be decided in the third match next Sunday. The champions of each group in Group B will be determined within this week and will be held at the same time as the final match of Group A.

Match Highlights:

Samsung kicked off and immediately took the offensive. Wu Shaotai headed the ball towards the goal, and the crossbar bounced it back, causing Lido a scare. Lido seized the opportunity to counterattack, and Zhang Mingsheng took two shots, both missing widely. Soon after, Samsung's star player Fan Jinyong injured his wrist in a Lido attack and was replaced by Hong Guangwei. The first half ended 0-0, with no goals scored. After the second half started, Lido Wenliang accidentally handled the ball, resulting in a free kick for Samsung. Wu Shaotai took the kick, which went out of bounds. After that, both sides went back and forth, neither side giving an inch. Twenty minutes later, Jin Peigen received a pass from Wu Shaotai and shot the ball into the net, breaking the deadlock. After Lido conceded, they launched a full-scale counterattack. Zhang Mingsheng went on a solo run and scored, tying the game. Time ran out, and the score was 1-1, with no winner determined. In addition, there were two Group B matches. Zhongyou and Nanmo both won. In a friendly match, Hengchang defeated Youyou.

Sexual Health

### Several Distinctions of Women's Lack of Libido

— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School

It is rare for men to be born with a lack of love; however, it is very common in women. In medicine, it is called "sexual deficiency." There is also weak libido, indifference to sexual intercourse, called "dulled sensitivity." There is also the presence of libido, but without arousing pleasure, called "anorgasmia." There are also cases where the reproductive organs do not have problems, only underdeveloped libido, like a child, called "psychological sexual infantilism." These women often have no romantic love with their husbands, forcing men to satisfy their desires outside the home, leading to a major cause of male prostitution, concubinage, and adultery.

Although some women's lack of libido is due to congenital reasons, it is common in society for men to have dissipated energy, kidney deficiency, and premature ejaculation, failing to satisfy their wives in their sex life. Over time, wives feel a dulling of sensation, forming a chance of never experiencing pleasure. This is the main cause of some cases of anorgasmia.

Some say, "Women's libido is weaker than men's." This is superficial. In reality, women's libido is not weaker than men's. If compared, it may even be higher than men's. Moreover, women are easily emotional, easily seduced by the opposite sex, and prefer sensual pleasure. Therefore, it is natural that a husband with impotence and premature ejaculation is not welcomed by his wife.

I believe that no husband wants to make his wife suffer this kind of distress, so the best solution is to quickly replenish essence and tonify the kidneys to cultivate the prosperity of his youth glands, because the youth glands in the human body are important glands that dominate sexual desire, so strengthening the youth glands will eliminate the above-mentioned diseases. I am a specialist in venereal diseases, and I know that these diseases can only be completely cured by taking the German genuine testicular essence preparation "Butibon" for men, because the composition of "Butibon" includes brain-tonifying phosphorus in addition to testicular essence, so it is very effective for neurasthenia, insomnia, and forgetfulness. This is what I have long relied on in clinical practice, and I have never encountered a case where it was ineffective. As for women's lack of libido and anorgasmia, women must take "Butibon," because this agent has the function of regulating menstruation and promoting pregnancy and is a holy medicine for gynecology.

### The Root Cause of Tuberculosis

— Tuberculosis Expert Sheng Zaiqiang

Contracting tuberculosis is like putting on a dirty oilcloth, which is indeed a bit scary. Patients often do not pay attention to it because of its very slow progress. By the time the patient discovers that they have tuberculosis and wants to seek treatment, they are burdened by insufficient economic resources or do not know which medicine is most effective. In my experience with tuberculosis, the most effective medicine is "Pulmonal," a special medicine for tuberculosis invented by German Dr. Street. This medicine can enhance the lungs' resistance and directly kill the tuberculosis bacteria in the lungs. The resistance of tuberculosis bacteria is extremely strong. One can only increase one's own resistance to surround the tuberculosis bacteria and deprive them of the raw materials for survival, while increasing the defenses around them to completely eliminate the stubborn tuberculosis bacteria. Then, the terrible tuberculosis will be permanently cured. Most common tuberculosis medicines on the market do not understand the underlying cause, so they are mostly ineffective. "Pulmonal" targets the source of the disease, so it is effective.

Modern Medicine

### It is Appropriate to Nourish the Body in Summer

— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang

Better Results Than in Winter

We often see many people with congenital weaknesses. When winter comes, they use ginseng, deer antler, sea dog kidney, and various other life-saving injections, choosing what suits their individual constitution. But when the hot summer comes, they do not use any nourishing medicines. This is a big mistake. Because our labor in summer is twice as much as in winter, and what is consumed is also twice as much as in other seasons. Taking sexual activity as an example, women in summer wear cicada-winged clothes, revealing their breasts and arms, and their bodies are graceful and sensuous. Therefore, it is easy to arouse our slight desire. All of these factors make supplementing the body in summer better than in winter. It can be said that supplementing the body in summer is even more important than in winter.

However, now that everyone understands the importance of supplementing the body in summer, another question arises: what kind of medicine is truly effective? Regarding this point, I can introduce you to what I have gained from years of experience.

From the perspective of the supplement itself, many winter tonics are too greasy. Because tonics are too greasy, they are unpleasant for the digestive function of the stomach. What's more, it is summer, when appetite is not good.

Fortunately, this problem has now been solved. Because German Dr. Mellon invented the youth gland preparation "Butibon," which can be said to be a very suitable summer tonic. It is not dry or greasy, and it can invigorate the spirit, promote appetite, and make people who work all day not feel a bit of boredom. It is absolutely guaranteed that people who easily feel insomnia in summer will not have insomnia if they take "Butibon." Because "Butibon" increases the health of the youth glands, making both appetite and sexual desire completely healthy.

### Causes of Weak Brain and Tinnitus

— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

The conditions of tinnitus are varied. Some occur occasionally, some last for a long time, some are suddenly high and low, and some stop and start suddenly. Some people distinguish the causes of tinnitus according to its pitch, saying that low pitch is caused by disorders of the sound transmission device, and high pitch is caused by disorders of the sound perception device, but this statement is not very reliable.

The causes of tinnitus are very complex, but most are caused by imbalance after illness, congenital deficiencies, and acquired injuries. Those with nocturnal emission often suffer from this condition. Long-term nocturnal emission, like water in a field, flows out continuously, resulting in the crops losing their moisture and withering. Therefore, people with long-term nocturnal emission have dull complexions, are weak and tired, and have no heroic spirit. They should be treated quickly to prevent long-term damage.

Regarding the treatment of nocturnal emission, choosing effective medicines to strengthen the sperm gate is essential, but if one does not pay attention to health preservation or engages in masturbatory behavior, taking large amounts of medicine can be said to be still ineffective. At this time, the patient should have a clear mind and few desires, reject lewd thoughts, and administer neurasthenia therapy. It is absolutely necessary to take the testicular essence preparation "Butibon" for men three times a day, three tablets each time, and take three tablets of "Ners nocturnal emission tablets" before bed. Not only can nocturnal emission be completely cured, but also the weak brain and tinnitus caused by nocturnal emission are guaranteed to be cured in a short period of time.

Gonorrhea Forum

### Reasons for Wife's Displeasure

— Physician Yao Juyan

Clinic: Intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road, No. 9

Most people who have contracted gonorrhea have gone to engage in promiscuous behavior because of sexual problems. This is already displeasing to those with wives. If they further transmit gonorrhea as a result, how can they explain themselves to the beauty in the house? Because the pathogenic bacteria of gonorrhea are diplococci, which have strong infectivity. If a married man has already contracted gonorrhea, he should first cure the gonorrhea before engaging in sexual intercourse from the perspective of humanity and love. However, most men, because they are husbands, urgently seek a quick cure and want to hide their suspicion from their wives, still engage in intercourse with their wives. They do not know that gonococci are the most easily transmitted bacteria. Since the husband's gonorrhea has not been cured, it will naturally be transmitted to the wife once they have sexual intercourse.

If a wife is unfortunately infected by her husband, a large amount of vaginal discharge will be produced, which is a great harm. The wife suffers this undeserved disaster for no reason, and her love for her husband will naturally be broken. The reason for this is that men with gonorrhea neglect their own viruses. However, it is not difficult to quickly resolve gonorrhea in its early stages. In my experience, taking the gonorrhea special medicine "Clinon," invented by Dr. Peter, is the most effective, because "Clinon" is based on non-specific therapy and is made with a mixture of protein and yellow pigment. After taking it, it causes all the cells of the patient to produce a kind of anti-gonorrhea toxin in a short period of time. Whether it is early or old white discharge, it can systematically eliminate it fundamentally. I also use German static electricity therapy and anti-gonorrhea serum for examination and use. It can be completely cured in three to five weeks. If the wife has also been infected, I prescribe her to use "Carr-Shute vaginal suppositories" for external use, and take "Clinon" internally and externally for treatment, and the effect is even faster. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM Daily from today, 20 consultation numbers will be given out. Each number costs only 50 cents and comes with a free copy of "The Complete Book of Venereal Diseases."

### The Origin of the Change in US Silver Policy

— Chen Chengren

A concrete and steel-reinforced vault, which took more than two years to build and was only completed last autumn, is located on the grounds of a military academy in the western United States. It is equipped with the latest protection mechanisms. The vault is 252 feet long, 166 feet wide, and 22 feet high. There, half of the nation's silver, amounting to 35,000 tons of silver bars, was transported from New York City and stored in this heavily guarded vault. This sensational news is still vividly imprinted in the minds of people around the world. However, in less than a year, the US policy of raising silver prices has now been forced to change. Although not completely canceled, the purchase price for overseas silver has been steadily decreasing. It is said that this is a diplomatic tactic because the Mexican government wants to reclaim US oil mining rights in Mexico; the US is retaliating by devaluing overseas silver prices. It is also said that because Japan has plundered a considerable amount of silver in the Chinese war zone, the policy of maintaining silver prices is being abandoned to strike a blow against them. This explanation is not entirely far-fetched and has some factual basis. However, the fundamental reason for the US changing its silver price policy is that the silver price policy has never benefited the US in any way, and it has even incurred expenses for implementing the policy, such as the construction cost of the aforementioned vault. Apart from the US silver mine owners and the congressmen they employ, almost no one supports this unprofitable policy. The following is an essay against the silver price policy by a reporter from a New York City bank, published in the bank's monthly bulletin last autumn. It points out the changes in US silver policy from a longitudinal perspective and predicts the inevitable end of the policy. Reading it now, with the silver advocates in the US having lost power, it is easier to understand the inevitability of this change. (The units of quantity below are all in the British system.)

About a hundred years ago, the US began to pay attention to the silver problem. In the fifteen years from 1878 to 1893, a total of 459,949,000 taels of silver were purchased, worth $462,210,000. Later, due to a panic, President Cleveland convened Congress and resolved to stop the purchase, thus ending the silver problem. During the European War, due to the surge in Indian exports, there was a shortage of payment instruments. Therefore, the US sold silver coins to Britain. However, the silver advocates in Congress insisted on adopting Pittman's method, that is, the amount of silver sold must still be replenished in the future, and the purchase price was limited to more than one dollar per tael. Until 1933, when the world experienced an economic panic and there was a shortage of currency everywhere, the silver advocates began to demand that the government quickly purchase silver at a price of 1.29. They believed that if the silver price could be raised to $1.29 (according to the old coinage rate), it would definitely increase the purchasing power of China, establish a bimetallic system, and restore the prosperity of the world. Therefore, under the leadership of the US, a silver conference was held in London in 1933, and an agreement was established by eight countries to preserve or trade silver; the US had to purchase 24,412,410 taels (equal to its domestic production) starting from December 1933, at a value of 64.64 US cents per tael. The government charged 50% of the coinage rate (1.29) as "coinage tax" and 13% of the market price. In June 1934, the Silver Purchase Act was passed, requiring the purchase of silver until the amount in the national treasury was equal to 25% of the total monetary reserves, but the purchase price could not exceed the monetary value of silver (i.e., 1.29). This Silver Purchase Act was similar to the Silver Purchase Acts of 1878 and 1890, believing that the result of purchasing silver would definitely raise the market price of silver bars to be equal to the coinage rate and expand the monetary use of silver. In August of that year, the US president issued an order for nationalizing silver, requiring the government to collect all commercial silver at a fixed price, and the difference between the purchase price and 1.29 was considered the coinage fee. And immediately implemented purchases from abroad. Immediately, a batch of silver weighing 400 tons was transported from London to New York. This silver transaction created the highest record for silver crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

During the economic panic at that time, silver also fell in price like other commodities. Silver averaged 58 US cents per tael in 1928, but fell to 27.8 cents in 1932. In 1933, due to the US dollar leaving the gold standard and the establishment of the eight-nation agreement, the silver price was maintained at an average price of 34.7 cents. In 1934, due to the efforts of the US government, it was raised to an average of 47.9 cents. In the second half of last year, influenced by the active purchases of the US Treasury and the target of 1.29, it soared madly for a while.

In fact, the soaring silver price was not beneficial to China, nor was it beneficial to Sino-US trade, contrary to their expectations. Because China has always adopted the silver standard, the rise in silver prices is the fall in the price of goods. For example, in 1932 and 1933, the fall in the price of Chinese products caused trade imbalances and silver outflows.

In October 1934, the Chinese government ordered a ban on silver exports, but due to the general rise in silver prices, silver was still smuggled out, and the amount was considerable. At that time, silver speculation was at its peak, raising prices above the US-set price. In April 1935, the London silver price reached 81 US cents. However, the US Treasury's purchase price for domestic silver was only 77.5 cents. In November of the same year, the Chinese government announced its abandonment of the silver standard and adopted a managed paper currency system. At the same time, the London silver market lost Washington's support and immediately showed signs of being top-heavy. Foreign silver fell from 81 cents to 43 cents. The US silver price initially remained at 77.5 cents, but was reduced to 64 and one-eighth cents in early 1938.

In May 1936, the Chinese government requested the cooperation of the US government to maintain a stable relationship between Chinese banknotes and US currency. At that time, an agreement was established in which the US government purchased a certain amount of Chinese silver (the amount was not announced) in exchange for US dollar credit or gold. And this agreement has been extended several times. Chinese silver was transferred from Hong Kong to London and then to New York. In the first half of 1938, 140,000,000 taels of Chinese silver coins were purchased, worth 63,000,000 US dollars. The Chinese silver purchased under the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, according to informal estimates, totaled 300,000,000 taels.

This cash sale of Chinese silver coins started about two years before the Sino-Japanese War. Although the exact amount was not officially announced, it was probably used as bank deposits, except for the marked gold. China used this huge sum to pay for foreign expenses.

When the US first implemented the Silver Purchase Act in 1934, the Treasury had $7,856,000,000 in gold reserves. According to the new law, there should be $2,619,000,000 in silver. At a rate of 1.19 per tael, this would be 2,016,000,000 taels. At that time, there were 693,000,000 taels of silver (including subsidiary coins), so 1,333,000,000 taels of silver should be purchased. However, by the end of June 1938, gold reserves had reached $12,962,000,000. Even after purchasing 1,687,000,000 taels of silver at a cost of $900,000,000, there was still a shortage of 970,000,000 taels. This was naturally because as the current surplus increased, the silver that should be purchased also increased. The silver collected by the US Treasury came from various countries in addition to its own. However, foreign silver totaled 1,353,000,000 taels, while domestic silver was only 333,000,000 taels, of which newly mined silver accounted for 120,000,000 taels. The above situation is the influence of the US Silver Purchase Act on silver prices. In these four years, the amount of silver coins concentrated in the United States for melting exceeded the purchase of newly mined silver. It is estimated that every tael of domestically newly mined silver was purchased relative to 6.2 taels of foreign silver. Therefore, the effort to restore the worldwide bimetallic system was like doing a play with a stone mortar on one's head.

The result of the US silver purchase policy was not only this, but also the following situations occurred.

(1) The hope of restoring the bimetallic system has since disappeared. When the US government was clearly behind the scenes, speculators were very enthusiastic. Once the US government showed a slight retreat, speculators immediately stopped buying. Furthermore, when the London Silver Agreement expired at the end of 1937, none of the other seven countries proposed to extend it. Therefore, the silver originally purchased by other countries was also dumped to the US.

(2) China, the only country using silver coins and purchasing 100 million taels of silver every year, had to abandon silver and adopt a managed paper currency system, and instead sell the silver accumulated over the dynasties on the world market.

(3) The US tried its best to raise silver prices and completely absorbed all the silver in the world. However, the maintenance of silver prices depended entirely on the US continuing to purchase. Once the purchase was weak, the silver price fell from 81 cents to 43 cents. In fact, this price of 43 cents was still maintained because the US came out to buy.

(4) In the July 1, 1938, Treasury report, the "coinage tax" income of $446,088,793 in the general fund and the amount of silver bars purchased under the Silver Purchase Act of 1934 did not increase. However, under the asset items, there were 870,940,306 taels of silver, valued at $479,600,198, calculated at an average price of 55 cents per tael. This number appeared for the first time as silver that did not receive "coinage tax," which is worth discussing.

It was found that in the first half of the year before last, the US government purchased $100 million worth of imported gold and specially tried to eliminate its activity, so that it would not invade the monetary system. This clearly showed that silver was not needed in the US monetary reserves.

Therefore, the reporter of the magazine concluded: "During the period when the Silver Purchase Act continued to be effective, US silver production increased from 24,000,000 taels in 1932 to 69,000,000 taels in 1937. The silver production of other countries was three to four times that of the US, and most of it was sold to the US government. In the first half of last year, the US silver import totaled 260,000,000 taels, valued at $112,000,000. What benefit does this investment bring to the American people? Furthermore, since the US silver purchase movement began, the US has never had the opportunity to resell. Every time the US wants to find a way to sell silver, it will cause widespread panic and the collapse of world silver prices, and it is still like this now. Just the administrative expenses spent by the US Treasury to purchase silver amounted to $287,000 in 1937."

Finally, he quoted President Cleveland's reasons for advocating the repeal of the Silver Purchase Act of 1890 in Congress in 1893, criticizing the mistakes of the recent silver price policy. He said: "The American people should have a sound and stable monetary system and should be recognized by various exchanges and markets. The government has no right to conduct financial experiments that violate the policies and habits of other civilized countries, thereby harming the interests of the people. The country also has no position to use our material wealth to harm the soundness of the people's currency." At the US Congress earlier this year, the silver opponents powerfully used this criticism again. It can be seen that this change in the US silver policy is clearly not just a diplomatic tactic. The abandonment of the US silver policy is indeed inevitable; but in terms of steps, it still has to be fully cautious. On the one hand, it still maintains the purchase price of domestic production at a higher level, and on the other hand, it slowly lowers the purchase price of overseas silver. This is out of fear that the silver price will plummet!

### A Review of Shanghai's Economy in the Past Six Months (Continued)

— Pan Wen'an

The Commodity Market in the Past Six Months

Looking back at the Shanghai commodity market in the past six months, it clearly showed a major crisis, that is, a certain party has already started its monopoly and manipulation methods. Merchants were unaware and did not conspire to unite to resist, but only competed for private interests. Finally, they allowed the monopoly to succeed, and the prices of various goods rose irrationally.

The reasons for this are nothing more than that within the Shanghai concession area, there are only some light industry and agricultural processing industry production facilities. The processing industry production in the occupied area has long been operated by a certain party. The total production volume is far greater than that in the concession area. Therefore, it itself has monopoly power in the supply market. Moreover, all agricultural products and raw materials are not produced in the concession area and are entirely dependent on imports from the mainland and overseas. A certain party used military force to control the distribution of products in the occupied area, and also used its control over transportation agencies and transportation lines in various places. Therefore, the transportation of products from the occupied area to Shanghai was subject to the will of a certain party. Whether it was extortion along the way, interception for their own use, or absolute prohibition of transportation to Shanghai, they had to be purchased from them. Therefore, the supply of the Shanghai commodity market increased and decreased from time to time. The transportation costs to Shanghai also rose steadily. If the Shanghai commodity market had restraint and no room for free contraction, and also adopted a joint purchase policy to confront, it could still curb the arbitrary demands and exactions of a certain party. However, people in various industries were ignorant of this principle and did not try to do this, but only competed to purchase and hoard in order to profit from the scarcity. Therefore, they entered their trap. In the past six months, cotton yarn rose sharply first, followed by soybean oil, then silk and rayon soared, and finally the rice market, which was subject to price limits. Wherever the evil hand reached, the prices rose to unprecedented levels. Commentators often mistakenly believe that they were indirectly affected by foreign exchange, but in fact, the manipulation of the evil hand was far greater than the impact of exchange rates.

The Price Increase of Shanghai Commodities in the Past Six Months (Unit: National Currency Yuan)

(Note) The standard products selected for the above commodities are: (1) Yarn (Double Horse Brand, 20 count); (2) Cotton (Fire Machine Cotton); (3) Rice (various grades of white japonica); (4) Flour (Green Ship No. 2); (5) Soybeans (Dalian round soybeans); (6) Soybean Oil (Dalian Oil); (7) Bean Cake (Dalian Cake); Silk (80 points or more, 20/22 denier). Except for June, which is the highest and lowest price of the entire month, the rest are the monthly averages. However, silk is the average of the middle of each month:

As for imported goods, with the decline in exchange rates, they also increased in the opposite direction. This degree of increase is roughly equal to the rate of decline in exchange rates. From the perspective of the entire national economy, the high prices of imported goods have the effect of naturally suppressing imports; however, it must be conditional on being able to self-supply or substitute. The people's strict frugality can indeed make up for the difficulties when the above conditions are insufficient. However, frugality has a certain limit. Otherwise, on the other hand, the increase in the people's hardship is also enough to weaken the vitality of the social economy. However, among China's imported goods, except for a few absolutely necessary items, the rest are non-urgent or unnecessary items or items that can be replaced domestically. Unfortunately, the people take pride in Europeanization, resulting in the main source of imports. Today, although the Ministry of Finance has implemented a policy of prohibiting imports, its legal power is difficult to enter Shanghai. I am afraid that the ability to suppress imports still cannot rely on foreign exchange policy?

The Latent and Deteriorating Crisis

Shanghai has a concentrated population and limited job supply. With prices so high, it is obviously enough to threaten the prosperity of the entire social economy. In the past, those that could rise were still imported goods and essential daily necessities. Therefore, the general public could still survive by frugality as much as possible. Judging from the Shanghai Worker's Cost of Living Index compiled by the China Statistics Society, the cost of living in the first half of the two years of this year and last year has increased significantly compared with before. As listed below:

However, since May, food costs have risen sharply. This item of consumption is very limited. In addition to cutting other consumption expenses to maintain food for the people, there is no other way. Yes: Only to increase their income. If so: Then the general price will increase again; otherwise, the general market will also shrink due to the decline in the purchasing power of the public, which is beyond doubt. This is one of the crises latent in Shanghai's economy.

Today's Shanghai is indeed in the so-called "wartime boom" period. The reasons for this are: First, the increase in population; Second, the war is far away from Shanghai, and it has gradually restored its position as a collection and distribution center geographically; Third, small-scale production in the concession area has developed as the market needs; Fourth, the destruction of production facilities and the decline in production in the suburbs; Fifth, the abundance of floating capital, the prosperity of speculation, the increase in unearned income and the indulgence in consumption; Sixth, the decline in exchange rates and the rise in prices have stimulated the operation of general commerce. However, the main reasons are still the dramatic increase in population and the maintenance of internal transportation relations. Unfortunately, these two major conditions have now changed. Has the population of Shanghai not decreased? But its increase has already stopped. Therefore, the market demand of the wood market has been invisibly limited. In addition, prices rise beyond purchasing power, which is reducing the degree of market demand. This is one of them. Recently, the Japanese army's strategy of blockading the sea routes in various parts of China is becoming more intense and being implemented. Once the door for domestic sales is cut off, the Shanghai market will inevitably fall into a state of exhaustion. This is the second. The transportation of products from the occupied area to Shanghai has been monopolized by a certain party, and the production facilities in the occupied area have been revived in the hands of the Japanese one after another. All of this is enough to greatly hit the production in the Shanghai concession area and increase the trade deficit in the concession area. This is the third. Any one of these blows is enough to restrain Shanghai's economy and prevent it from continuing to thrive. Moreover, three aspects have occurred at the same time, and the people's livelihood is uneasy due to the soaring price of grain. Therefore, Shanghai's "boom" today is feared to be on the verge of the most critical juncture.

### Shanghai Industry Before and After the War (Continued)

— Hui

Here are the losses suffered by the entire Shanghai industry during the war, based on reports from various trade associations: "(1) Textile factories, 30 run by Chinese businessmen, of which 7 factories have been working throughout, and the remaining 23 have suffered losses of varying degrees. (2) Dyehouses, a total of 19 of all sizes, were destroyed during the war. (3) Knitting factories, a total of 50, of which 15 were destroyed. (4) Silk reeling factories, almost all of them were destroyed except for the 4 within the defense line. (5) Silk weaving factories, with hundreds, of which 300 were destroyed. (6) Chemical plants, 9 large-scale factories were destroyed. (7) Soap factories, 6 large-scale factories were completely destroyed. (8) Paper mills, only 4 were operating, 5 were completely destroyed, and 15 suffered major damage of varying degrees. (9) Printing factories, the 2 largest were severely damaged, and a total of 200 small-scale printing factories were destroyed. (10) Tobacco factories, a total of 18, of which 8 were completely destroyed. (11) Flour mills, a total of 15, of which 8 were destroyed. (12) Lumber mills, a total of 22, were either destroyed or severely damaged. (13) Machine factories, there were large-scale shipyards, machine factories, ordnance factories, printing machine factories, and scientific instrument factories, all of which suffered extremely heavy damage; hundreds of small-scale factories were completely destroyed. (14) Rubber factories, a total of 35, of which only 6 were able to resume operation. (15) Glass factories, a total of 26, half of which were destroyed. In addition, there were several daily necessities manufacturing factories, including companies manufacturing canned goods, educational supplies, hemp rope and its goods, all of which were also destroyed." (See the "Great British Night Post" published on May 1). The estimated losses range from 450 million yuan to 800 million to 4 billion yuan. But the exact figures cannot be determined even now. However, no one would deny that the losses suffered by Shanghai's industry after the war were not significant.

Although Shanghai's industry suffered significant destruction and losses after the war, it soon gradually showed a lively posture and emerged. And in the second half of last year, there was even rapid progress.

Commercial News

### Financial Spot Black Market Not Heard of Opening, Price Similar to Saturday

Yesterday, the local spot black market was closed due to the Sunday holiday. The price of outside trades has not been called. It is heard that the retail price of the money exchange industry is similar to the closing price of last Saturday, around 2,620 yuan, with little fluctuation.

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael has of course not changed. Da Tong Hang quoted 265 yuan, Xin Tong Hang quoted 263 yuan, and the purchase price was 257 yuan. Only Heng Fu offered a high price of 266 yuan.

### Overseas Silver Prices Quiet

London, 15th: English pure gold has not changed, remaining at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 5 and a half pence per ounce.

### Overseas Silver Prices Quiet

Also, New York reported that US silver spot prices are still stable. Bombay reported that Indian silver spot prices and July futures both increased by one anna, August increased by two annas, and the market situation is stable. A total of 120 transactions were made.

### Foodstuffs Saigon Rice Arrives, 700 Tons

The local national rice price soared, and foreign rice took the chance to revive its business. General foreign rice merchants have been placing orders from Vietnam and Siam. However, recently the foreign exchange application has been strict, which is extremely inconvenient. But with the excuse of people's food, it can still be managed. It is now heard that Da Fu Foreign Company's first batch of 700 tons of foreign indica rice, namely 7,000 bags, has been shipped, loaded on the Italian postal ship company's Cortellazzo, which is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, Monday.

### Sugar Market Local Factory Ice Drops Half Yuan

Yesterday, the sugar market was flat and soft, continuing to decline. The association's trading price for spot goods was 24 yuan and a few jiao for coarse white. The local company's price was 29 yuan and 1 jiao, the foreign company's price was 29 yuan, and the transferrable goods were 20 yuan and 8 jiao for a few jiao. Tai Koo's Car White B Mark maintained its original price, decreasing by a few jiao in order. CW Mark was 30 yuan and 1 jiao, CX Mark was 29 yuan and 8 jiao, DY Mark was 29 yuan and a half, HX Mark was 29 yuan and 3 jiao. Spot Dutch red decreased by a few jiao to 22 yuan and 2 jiao. The local factory ice dropped by half a yuan. No. 1 Ice was 34 yuan and a half, and Jing Ming Ice was 36 yuan. As the price of national sugar has been rising recently, although the goods are scarce, sales are also low, so the company's intention to import has gradually faded. Except for a few scattered transactions, there is a lack of wholesale transactions. The future market is guarded against loosening.

### North-South Goods Dalian Soybeans Recover 2 Yuan

The lowest price of Dalian soybeans in the previous market had fallen to 21 yuan and a few yuan. But recently, the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs suddenly became active, handling a total of five or six truckloads, a total of 1,500 to 1,600 bags, so the market price rose by about two yuan. Yesterday's market price was 24 yuan and a half. It is heard that the new season of Xu Kui soybeans is approaching in the production area, and the large ones may be shipped to Shanghai at the end of this month.

### Coal Firewood Arrived in Short Supply

The firewood market, recently due to the ever-changing situation in eastern Zhejiang, the arrival of sailboats is intermittent, and the local market's outbound routes, due to Tianjin and Gulangyu having handled large quantities a month ago, have led to a shortage of spot goods, and the market situation continues to be strong. The industry's split prices are as follows: large anti-white firewood is 6 bundles per yuan, small anti-white firewood is 22 bundles, firewood is 14 bundles, and firewood is 20 bundles. Dock transfer and delivery require additional cartage fees.

### Metals: White Iron Tiles Sell Well, Market Considered Active

The white iron tile sales market primarily targets the local construction trade, while sales to other trades are also considered active. Recently, due to vigorous purchases by the Tianjin trade and subsequent competition from local construction groups, the white iron tile market is quite lively, with standard prices rising sharply. Currently, 6-foot sheets sell for 2 yuan 5 jiao and 7-foot sheets sell for 3 yuan, both increases compared to previous prices. Other construction materials, such as 3-4 fen bamboo-joint steel bars, are priced at 370 yuan per ton, while 5 fen to coarse patterns sell for 340 yuan per ton. 6-foot plain white iron sheets sell for 2 yuan 4 jiao each, and 7-foot sheets sell for 2 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen. New disc ingots sell for 18 yuan per dan (unit of weight), binding wire sells for 16 yuan 5 jiao per dan, and original capital nails are priced around 20 yuan per barrel, all showing a slight upward trend compared to previous prices.

### British Admiral Visits the King of Siam

The British Naval Admiral, aboard the warship Erlunzhu, sailed to Luo Luobin Cape, also known as Bangkok, the capital of Siam, built along the Chao Phraya River. Due to shallow waters at the sea entrance, the warship could not enter, so two small steamers carried the Admiral and his accompanying officers. Along the way, they saw dense fields of crops and flourishing sugarcane, with a vast expanse of green between the fields, and the breeze brought coolness to their robes. The ship docked at the British Consulate, a building originally facing the sea. The weather that day was scorching, with the thermometer rising to 90 degrees. The British Consul informed the Siamese high officials of the Admiral's desire to meet the King. Despite the oppressive heat, full military dress was required for the audience. There were two Kings in Siam: the Great King and the Second King. The Admiral first paid respects to the Great King, who sat on a couch, leaning on a jade table, with the Second King seated beside him. The Consul led the Admiral forward, and after the formalities, the Great King invited them to a side hall, lavishly decorated. The King sat, with the Consul and Admiral seated to his left and right. The King was in his prime, only twenty-one years old. The Second King wore a military uniform with a sword, resembling a British cavalry officer, and his duty was to command the royal guards. An elderly minister wore diamonds as buttons on his robe. The palace floor was covered with mica, and the windows were draped with silk brocade, with dazzling colors. After the conversation, they went out to listen to drum music, the melody was melodious and rhythmic, as the Admiral had brought his own band to perform. The Admiral then returned to his ship, removing his military dress, feeling as if he had escaped from a fiery pit. The next day, he also visited the Second King, whose palace was slightly less luxurious, but still grand and spacious. Three days later, the Second King, accompanied by an old minister, returned the visit on the warship, ordering the raising of the mast and firing of cannons as a respectful welcome. The conversation was extremely cordial. The Second King closely examined the ship's equipment, expressing great admiration, and presented the Admiral with gold medals and other gifts, showing exceptional courtesy and humility, as if forgetting his royal status.

### Original Suitability

— Ci Kai

Born into this world, people have to adapt to the environment, or there will be a danger of "falling behind" and "degenerating." Therefore, if people want to seek progress and conform to the trends of the times, they must adapt to the surrounding environment one by one. It would be even better if they could intensify this and be "overly sensitive," because preventing problems before they happen, refusing to eat because of choking, and refusing to drink because of sputtering, until not eating or drinking, "dying only after," or even being like the man of Qi fearing the sky and everyone hanging themselves, is the best strategy for adapting.

Reading the same ancient books, the way ancient people read them is completely different from the way modern people read them. Ancient people read books thinking that a great man should be "rich and not licentious, poor and not moved, and mighty and not bent"; they also thought that a great man "once speaks, four horses cannot catch up." Modern people only memorize the sentence "A great man can bend and stretch," and even suspect that the previous two sentences were forged by later generations and can be ignored. This is because modern people are good at adapting. Therefore, under the immortal theorem of "the National Army retreating west in a different environment," strange things are endless. If someone had nothing to do and wrote a modern Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, it would be a good business. To give a small example, attending entertainment events on the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death to show superiority is bending; when meeting people, saying that when the war of resistance is won in the future, they will kowtow three times more in front of Sun Yat-sen's portrait is stretching. Modern youth dancing, skating, and swimming, when questioned, say that the environment is like this, which is bending; they also say that dancing can practice hand-to-hand combat, and swimming and skating can practice water warfare, and even when charging in the frozen areas of the north, they can put on ice skates and slide down, speeding like the wind and splitting bamboo, which is stretching. Being able to bend and stretch is truly worthy of being a "great man"! Small things are like this, and big things can be imagined, so I won't say more. There are so many great men like this, excuse me! Excuse me!

However, if a great man can bend and stretch, he is still worthy of being a great man. The most unfortunate people in the world are those great men who can bend but cannot stretch! When times are good, they simply don't know how to stretch; when times are bad, they bend again and again, gritting their teeth and "bending bitterly"; when an opportunity comes, they even advise others to learn to "bend" like them. They can be said to adapt to the environment to the fullest extent; they can also be said to bend to the fullest extent. Therefore, they can be called "Bending Great Men," which is almost the same name as the former "Qu Yuan." In fact, their bending until death is indeed much better than Qu Yuan's throwing himself into the river; the reason is that they are good at adapting, so no wonder Darwin sighed: "Alas, the fittest survive!"

Opening the dictionary, I just thought that the word "fit" can also be interpreted as "marry." From "marry," I inadvertently thought of the phrase "marry a chicken, follow the chicken; marry a dog, follow the dog." I have not read the Explaining Words and Analyzing Characters, but I think the reason why "fit" can be interpreted as marrying is because of this idiom. A person who wants to adapt to the environment has to hold a bowl of rice, marry a chicken and follow the chicken, marry a dog and follow the dog. After marrying, everything said before can be declared invalid and can be regarded as farting. The first item under "fit" in the National Pronunciation Dictionary says: "To go, also a woman's marriage is called fitting a man," which shows that "fit," "marry," and "go" have the same meaning. Therefore, we can also say: "Go chicken, follow chicken; go dog, follow dog." "Go dog" naturally means "go to the dog's place." Dogs bark and bite at those who are dressed in rags, and welcome and fawn on those who are dressed in gorgeous clothes, which shows that "going to the dog" is not easy.

Postscript: The author's knowledge is shallow, and omissions are unavoidable, but I do not hope that scholars at home and abroad will not hesitate to teach me, because even a slight statement will lose the way of "fitting."

### Chop It Down Day After Day

### On the Road to Danyang

— Le Huan

——A Battlefield Account from the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Line——

It was November, and snow was just starting to fall, with wind blowing. The countryside revealed a desolate scene. Our small team, facing the wind and snow, began our journey towards Danyang.

All along, relying on the towering telegraph poles along the railway as our guide, we trod on the slippery muddy path, crossing streams and villages. Along the way, each of us silently calculated how much distance we had slipped under our feet. Sparse sounds of chickens crowing and dogs barking occasionally drifted from the villages, further emphasizing the tranquility of the land.

The wind grew stronger, and although we wore cotton clothes, they were as thin as autumn clothes. Even vigorous running couldn't resist the cold. Our limbs were numb, and our bodies were shivering. The wind blew head-on, reducing our speed to about seven miles per hour.

Step by step, we kept our mouths shut. The force of the wind often blocked our breathing through our noses. Each comrade bent over, as if covering during a charge, or more like a boat tracker by the river.

After crossing a stone bridge and passing several small trees, we arrived at a small village ahead. It was time for a rest, and we had completed two-thirds of the journey.

All the strong men in the village had gone to defend the area, leaving only a few women and young children. We entered a house near the entrance of the village. An old woman, around sixty years old, was leaning against the door, watching. Two innocent children stood beside her.

"Excuse me, old lady, do you have anything you can sell us to fill our stomachs?" the secretary asked in his Hunan dialect, shaking off the snowflakes.

"Oh..." The old woman rolled her eyes, not understanding the secretary's words. This was when we needed to act as temporary translators.

"There's nothing good in the countryside. We have rice, but no vegetables!" The old woman took a liking to our local dialect and wore a kind smile on her wrinkled face.

"We don't need rice. It's too much trouble. It would be best if there was something ready-made because we still need to travel!" Si Zheng very gently asked the old woman to think of a solution. In fact, what was left in our stomachs was still from last night!

"Then let me look around..." The old woman began to rummage, and the children helped her search.

"Sweet potato...!" A child held up a very large one.

"Sweet potato?" I jumped up with joy. I had loved it for a long time, even when I was in my hometown three or four years ago. Since entering the circle of life, I hadn't tasted it for three or four years. I didn't expect to taste it again at this time and place.

The old woman was stunned by my loud exclamation.

"Just sweet potato then. It's a very delicious thing. Thank you, old lady!"

"Delicious? How can there be anything good in the countryside? If you don't mind, I'll cook it for you!"

"Good! Let's do that." The secretary also expressed his happiness.

Although the old woman was so old, her movements were quick and strong. She broke off the reeds one by one and sent them into the stove, which burned brightly. The house gradually warmed up, and our numb limbs slowly recovered.

She stared at the flames for a long time, putting more reeds in, and said to us, looking back, "You must be very tired!" The firelight flickered on the old woman's face, making it very rosy.

"No, old lady, you're the one who's tired!"

"Alas! I'm old and useless! I'm only fit to sit at home and wait to die... Alas, how's the situation these days? It shouldn't be too bad, right!"

"Here? It's safe for now." Two streams of thought rose in my heart.

The water boiled, and the old woman didn't ask any more questions. She stood up, lifted the lid of the pot, and used chopsticks to pick up the sweet potatoes, saying happily, "It's almost ready!"

### Mourning Gongsun Min

— Wang Fen

—A Fighter in the Theater World

I was shocked when I accidentally saw the news of Gongsun Min's death in the newspaper. Could it be him, Gongsun Min, who appeared on the stage with the demeanor of a warrior, who died in Shanghai? The newspaper's account was vague, only saying that he had a relapse of typhoid fever, the treatment was ineffective, and he died in ×× hospital. It didn't mention a single word about his accomplishments, his career, his background, or his family situation. I suspected that it was another person who happened to have the same name and surname as him, who died in the hospital from illness. However, I also intuitively felt that this suspicion was unnecessary, and I intuitively affirmed that it must be him! There are probably not many friends in Shanghai who know Gongsun Min, perhaps very few of my friends know Gongsun Min, so apart from a piece of news in the newspaper, I haven't heard anyone talk about it. Sometimes when I ask people, they don't even know about the record in the newspaper. A fighter in the theater world, dying so lonely, is really a most lamentable thing. I don't know if the comrades in the Shanghai theater world know this fighter? Do they know the sad news of this fighter? If there are also people who know him, I believe they should mourn him well.

My acquaintance with Gongsun Min was a year ago. At that time, I was in Guilin, Guangxi. Every Sunday, I often went to Yu Tang Fengzi's house to chat. Because Fengzi loved drama, I could often meet many writers and actors at her house. One time, we were chatting with Ouyang Yuqian when suddenly a friend wearing a black shirt came, acting quickly and looking excited. Fengzi vaguely introduced him to me, knowing that he was an actor in the National Defense Art Society of the Fifth Route Army Headquarters, and was rehearsing Yang Hansheng's "The Eve" and Ouyang Yuqian's "In the Green Yarn Tent." Both of these scripts had Fengzi's involvement, and even Yu Tang participated in the performance of "The Eve." Probably that afternoon, they were preparing to rehearse, so I said goodbye and came out first. A week later, I went to Fengzi's house as usual, and saw a guest who was already at her house. I couldn't remember who he was for a moment, but he greeted me. This time, I knew that his name was Gongsun Min. And this time, he gave me a deep impression: he had the enthusiasm of youth, and the dignity of old age, the sensitivity of a poet, and the soul of a playwright. He had thoughts, achievements, and backbone! I felt that an actor like him should not be regarded as just an actor!

After that, I saw him two or three more times. But these two or three times were completely different. It was on the stage, appearing with the demeanor of a warrior. After listening to his lines and watching his performance, I was deeply moved, and I believe I was definitely not the only one who was moved. I simply forgot that I was watching a play, and I also forgot that he was acting. I thought that all the actions and all the words were what every Chinese person with flesh and blood should express and proclaim. I felt that Gongsun Min was the character in the play, and the character in the play was the personification of Gongsun Min's personality. In art, he was successful; and in personality, I had a better understanding of him. However, because I was always busy with trivial matters, I had no opportunity to see him again after that. When I left Guangxi, I became even more distant from him.

More than two months ago, a friend suddenly came to find me. Unexpectedly, it was Gongsun Min who had come all the way from Guangxi to Shanghai. He still had that enthusiastic and dignified appearance, narrating the experience of leaving Guilin in a torrent of words. He asked me about the situation in the Shanghai theater world, and I was ashamed that I had nothing to say. I asked him how he would live in the future, and he seemed still prepared to engage in literary and theatrical work. He told me that he lived on ×× Road, and he also copied down my phone number, preparing to talk again later. Who knew that this farewell would become eternal? I myself was busy all day long and had no time to visit any friends. And he, I don't know why, never came to visit me. When I saw the record in the newspaper, I learned that he had been ill for a month, and after a month, he died of a relapse of typhoid fever! Such a fighter in the theater world, not dying in artillery fire, not dying in bombing, but dying from an incurable disease, was really too wronged!

When writing this short article, I kept looking at Gongsun Min's stills published in the 140th issue of Liangyou, which were from the performance in Guilin. However, the person is gone, and the image remains, only increasing my grief!

### Red Devil Vasika

— By Maxim Gorky, Translated by Di Zhou

Although they spoke in low voices, their momentum was fierce. They surrounded Vasika's bed, looking at his gray face with fierce but gleeful eyes; he also looked at them. In his eyes, there was no longer that insatiable greed—that inexplicable greed that was always shining in his eyes.

"You... see clearly... I will get better..."

"That's God's will, you won't get better..." Rita interrupted him.

Vasika closed his mouth tightly without saying a word.

"Does that leg hurt?" One of them leaned down and asked kindly, her face turning green, her teeth grinding, "Ah, is it this side?"

As she spoke, she grabbed Vasika's injured leg and pulled it hard towards her.

Vasika bit his teeth and groaned. His left hand was also broken. He waved his right hand to hit her, but hit his own stomach instead.

A burst of laughter erupted around him.

"Stinky thing!" He opened his eyes in fear and shouted, "You be careful! I will kill you in the future..."

But they jumped back and forth around his bed, pulling his hair, spitting on his face, and dragging his sore feet. Their eyes were on fire. They laughed, cursed, and cried like dogs. Their curses were all in vulgar and unbearable language. They were so caught up in revenge that they became enraged. They took off their clothes and became a group of snow-white figures, which was very frightening.

Vasika shook his right hand and roared. The madam stood at the door and shouted in a rude voice:

"Enough... If you touch him again, I will call the police! You will kill him... God! God..."

But they didn't hear her. He had abused them for several years—they were just repaying him for a moment, so they were all angry and unwilling to give up...

Suddenly, in this clamor and groaning "enjoyment", a rude, reprimanding voice arose:

"You... enough already... Please have a little pity... He is also... suffering the same... Aren't you? Good-hearted people, for Jesus's sake... good-hearted..." These words seemed like a basin of cold water poured on the prostitutes, and had an effect? They were surprised and quickly ran away.

The one who spoke was A Qusniya. She stood by the window, shaking all over, holding her belly with both hands, comically stretching her body forward, and bowing deeply to them.

Vasika had fallen asleep. The shirt on his chest was torn, and his broad chest, covered with dense red hair, was beating quickly—as if agitated by a torrent.

Gurgling sounds came from his throat. His eyes were closed. (Nine)

### Joy (1)

Joyful people are rarely seen in society, and it can be said that they are never seen. Because what is seen in society is bitterness, resentment, jealousy, strife, grievances, slander, hatred, murder, and tragic scenes, where can there be joyful people?

Some people say that Shanghai society is a joyful society. Movie theaters, dance halls, Pingju operas, variety shows, drum lyrics, casinos, opium dens, and emerging clubs are all crowded with people. Aren't they all happy, jumping, crowded, joyful people? I say, alas! This is a reaction to depression, where is there joy? The people inside are muddled and cannot talk about joy or sorrow. If there are rational people, they are all shrouded in clouds of sorrow, as if entering human hell. Once they fall, they are unable to extricate themselves. It's really wanting to cry but having no tears, so where can they get joy?

The joy I am talking about not only does not include this kind of inferior entertainment, but also does not include the highest level of material enjoyment and the most transcendent cultivation of sentiment. These two kinds of people may occasionally have a taste of shallow joy, but it is not the true and great joy, so it cannot be regarded as joy. The joy I am talking about is the most real joy. The environment changes in myriad ways, but joy does not change. Human affairs are impermanent, but joy is constant. Its joy comes from the depths of the soul, and others cannot suppress it, and oneself cannot stop it. It is full of vitality and naturally revealed, so that people who are close to it can feel the sweetness and the joy of broad daylight. Only those who truly believe in the Lord Jesus are like this. This kind of great joy can be experienced by everyone, but it cannot be described in writing even in the slightest. Shanghai Christian Literature Publishing Society, P.O. Box 1227.

### A Perspective on the Legal Validity of Transfer Drafts for Settlement

— Ding Yuchang

Yesterday, I read Mr. Yu Yonghua's article, "Following My Article on the Ministry of Finance's Telegraphic Transfer Restriction Measures," which stated, "Solely from a legal perspective, the previous financial stabilization measures were implemented effectively in the interior for a long time without hindrance. Why have they gradually lost their effectiveness in Shanghai, requiring the Ministry of Finance's recent telegraphic transfers for supplementary restrictions? This can only be attributed to the Shanghai Bankers' Joint Reserve Association's publicly set exchange rates for drafts and the court's rulings that transfer drafts do not have legal tender status, leading to this situation." This expresses deep regret that the Shanghai Bankers' Joint Reserve Association and the courts have failed to deeply understand and earnestly implement the national policy of stabilizing finance. Criticizing the virtuous is a classic principle, and its argument is quite appropriate. However, Shanghai's environment is unique, and the government often faces obstacles when implementing national policies during wartime, not just in the matter of drafts. The crux of the matter lies in the fact that our country's legal rights in Shanghai have not been fully maintained.

Since our country implemented the legal tender (fapi) policy, the legal tender has been the sole currency, as confirmed by law and in fact. Following the "August 13th Incident," the government implemented "Financial Stabilization Measures" to restrict withdrawals and deposits. In Shanghai, transfer drafts were universally used by banks and money shops, serving to prevent capital flight and reduce the circulation of legal tender, preventing it from being exploited by the Japanese puppet regime to obtain foreign exchange. Transfer drafts originally took the form of negotiable instruments but served as a supplementary currency to the legal tender. Banks and money shops used them to pay legal tender deposits, and according to the law, they had the same settlement validity as legal tender, without any distinction. The fact that they could not be exchanged for legal tender, like general negotiable instruments, was confirmed by government decrees, which also served to prevent capital flight and reduce the circulation of legal tender. However, as the war prolonged, the twenty-week period had long passed, and even the 5% weekly withdrawal limit could be fully exhausted. Furthermore, since March of last year, the government implemented foreign exchange controls and promulgated the "Foreign Exchange Application Regulations." Legally, the buying and selling of foreign exchange should be centralized at the Central Bank. "Foreign exchange that the state refuses to supply, sought instead in the black market, cannot be considered normal." However, due to the existence of the concession system and the presence of numerous foreign banks, capital flight had an easy path to follow. Coupled with the westward shift of the war, Shanghai's position as China's financial center remained unshaken. Therefore, foreign trade in the interior relied on Shanghai as the final clearing location. A surge in imports became a common phenomenon in China's international trade, and it is undeniable that the government could not satisfy the Shanghai foreign exchange market, both in terms of national policy and in practice. This led to the emergence of a foreign exchange black market. In this illegal foreign exchange black market, legal tender could be used to freely buy foreign exchange outside the "Foreign Exchange Application Regulations." However, transfer drafts could not be exchanged for foreign exchange in the black market; they had to be converted into legal tender first. Consequently, the settlement validity of transfer drafts inevitably became unstable, which is the main reason for the discount on transfer drafts. If there were no foreign exchange black market, and legal tender could not be used to obtain foreign exchange without applying to the Central Bank according to the "Foreign Exchange Application Regulations," then why would holders of transfer drafts accept a discount to exchange them for legal tender? Why would various industries hold discriminatory views towards transfer drafts? And why would the maintenance of the same settlement validity between transfer drafts and legal tender become a problem? But does the government have the power to eliminate the foreign exchange black market? No one can answer this question with certainty. Therefore, the denial of the same settlement validity between transfer drafts and legal tender, while formally a court judgment, is essentially due to the illegal foreign exchange black market. Since the foreign exchange black market cannot be legally suppressed, even if the court rules to maintain the settlement validity of transfer drafts, it would only create further disputes. Ultimately, it would merely transform a legal issue into a diplomatic one.

Moreover, the Bankers' Joint Reserve Association announced the exchange rates for transfer drafts at the time under the entrustment of national banks and to safeguard general legitimate commerce. When the discount on transfer drafts continued to rise sharply, speculation and manipulation became deeply entrenched. If national banks did not authorize the Bankers' Joint Reserve Association to stabilize the discount rate on transfer drafts, the disparity between transfer drafts and legal tender would widen even further, further benefiting speculators. Although the government has put great effort into stabilizing Shanghai's finances, the special environment and incomplete legal rights have hindered its measures. For example, since the "Financial Stabilization Measures" after the "August 13th Incident" confirmed that transfer drafts could be used to pay legal tender deposits, their settlement validity should be maintained before this law becomes invalid. Why, according to recent reports, did the four national banks—Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank—only allow 95% of the 22 million yuan in transfer deposits from banks and money shops to be exchanged for legal tender starting from July 4th? This means that transfer drafts do not have the same settlement validity as legal tender, not only as judged by the courts but also as confirmed by the government. With such contradictory measures from the government, how can the settlement validity of transfer drafts be maintained?

In conclusion, Shanghai's environment is unique, and the financial industry has a strong colonial character, especially in today's isolated island era. The government's promulgation of wartime financial stabilization laws and regulations based on national policy often encounters difficulties due to incomplete legal rights, sometimes even leading to distorted phenomena. The settlement validity of transfer drafts, initially confirmed by laws and regulations and then denied by the courts and the government, is one example of this distorted phenomenon. Even the recent government measures regarding foreign exchange, revising the "Foreign Exchange Application Regulations" to the "Imported Goods Foreign Exchange Application Regulations" and promulgating the "Prohibition of Imported Goods Measures," cannot be said to be unaffected by Shanghai's illegal foreign exchange black market. And the failure to fully maintain Shanghai's legal rights is an important factor contributing to this unique environment.

Research and Criticism

### The Relationship Between Private Prosecution and the Victim (Continued)

— Mu Weijun

How Victims Can Utilize Private Prosecution Procedures

If a criminal case meets the above-mentioned positive and negative requirements, it is legal for the victim to initiate a private prosecution and request a public prosecution. Therefore, in situations where the requirements for private prosecution are met, the victim can choose to initiate a private prosecution or file a complaint requesting a public prosecution. Although the private prosecution procedure is designed to protect individual legal rights, the benefits it offers to victims are often overlooked by the general public. Consequently, victims often only file complaints requesting a public prosecution for crimes that meet the requirements for private prosecution, unaware of the potential advantages of utilizing the private prosecution procedure. The benefits of the private prosecution procedure for victims are outlined below:

If the victim wishes to pursue a public prosecution, they can file a complaint with the prosecutor or judicial police officer (in the Shanghai concessions, with the police). While this procedure is simpler than private prosecution in terms of formalities, Article 315 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that "if the prosecutor concludes the investigation of the same case, a private prosecution cannot be initiated again." Therefore, after a complaint is filed, if the prosecutor concludes the investigation, regardless of whether the result is prosecution or not, the victim loses the right to initiate a private prosecution. Furthermore, Article 232 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that "in cases involving crimes listed in Article 61 of the Criminal Law, the prosecutor may make a disposition of non-prosecution if they deem it appropriate, taking into account the matters listed in Article 57 of the Criminal Law." If Anbo concludes the investigation and decides not to prosecute, the victim (original complainant) can only, according to Article 235 of the Criminal Procedure Law, within seven days of receiving the decision of non-prosecution, submit a written statement outlining the reasons for disagreement, through the original prosecutor, to the chief prosecutor or procurator general of the direct superior court, requesting reconsideration. There is no other means of redress.

Article 336 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that "if a party is dissatisfied with the judgment of the lower court, they may appeal to the higher court." The term "party" in this context, according to Article 3 of the same law, refers to the prosecutor, the private prosecutor, and the defendant. Therefore, the prosecutor, the private prosecutor, and the defendant can all be the subjects of an appeal. However, because the parties in a public prosecution and a private prosecution are different, the subjects of appeal differ accordingly. The parties in a public prosecution are the prosecutor and the defendant, so those with the right to appeal are also the prosecutor and the defendant. Since the victim is not a party in a public prosecution, they naturally have no right to appeal. If the victim is the original complainant, they may request the prosecutor to appeal, but the prosecutor has the discretion to grant or deny the request and is not bound by it. In a private prosecution, the parties are the private prosecutor and the defendant, and those with the right to appeal are also the private prosecutor and the defendant. Therefore, a victim who initiates a private prosecution has the right to appeal if they are dissatisfied with the judgment of the private prosecution case, according to the law.

Article 491 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that "a person who has suffered damage as a result of a crime may, in criminal proceedings, incidentally file a civil lawsuit, requesting compensation for their damages from the defendant and the person liable for compensation under the Civil Code." Therefore, if a victim has suffered damage as a result of a crime, whether in a private prosecution or a public prosecution, they may, according to Article 492 of the same law, file an incidental civil lawsuit after the initiation of criminal proceedings and before the conclusion of the second instance arguments. If a victim files a complaint requesting a public prosecution and the prosecutor concludes the investigation and decides not to prosecute, the victim can only request reconsideration according to the law and cannot initiate a private prosecution, as mentioned earlier. If the result of the reconsideration is still non-prosecution, the victim who has suffered damage as a result of the crime can only pay the litigation costs and file an incidental civil lawsuit in the civil court. This is because filing an incidental civil lawsuit, according to the law, must be done after the initiation of criminal proceedings to meet the requirement of being incidental.

Article 507, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that "if an incidental civil lawsuit is dismissed due to a judgment of acquittal, dismissal of prosecution, or non-acceptance in criminal proceedings, an appeal cannot be filed unless there is an appeal against the judgment in the criminal proceedings." In public prosecution proceedings, the victim is not a party to the criminal proceedings, so they are not entitled to be the subject of an appeal, as mentioned earlier. If the prosecutor does not appeal the judgment in the criminal proceedings, the victim cannot appeal the judgment dismissing the incidental civil lawsuit, even if they are dissatisfied.

Since the relationship between private prosecution and the victim is as described above, victims should know what to do when there is a situation where they can utilize the private prosecution procedure. (The End)

News

### Shanghai Bar Association

It has been found that member Xu Zuoliang has submitted two proposals that have been processed and recorded as follows:

A Proposal Regarding Lawyers Wearing Neat Uniforms in Court to Emphasize the System

Judges, prosecutors, and lawyers are the three major professions in the judiciary. The state, in the solemn courtroom, specially permits lawyers to wear uniforms and sit in court to respect their position. Lawyers, in performing their duties, should not only fulfill their responsibility of integrity and trustworthiness, but also be mindful of their demeanor and etiquette. It has been observed that some lawyers appearing in court do not button their uniforms properly, and some even have their lapels open like cloaks, which is disrespectful to the system. The Shanghai court is subject to scrutiny by both Chinese and foreigners, and all lawyers should exercise self-restraint. It is hoped that in the future, when appearing in court, lawyers will wear neat uniforms and not neglect these minor details. Members may have occasional observations and dare to offer them without impropriety, requesting discussion and resolution to notify all members to pay attention to the system and respect etiquette. This request is addressed to the Shanghai Bar Association.

A Proposal Regarding Matters Requiring Attention and Correction in Court Trials of Criminal Cases

I rarely handle criminal defense cases. Recently, I observed in a certain court of the Special First Court that there are aspects of the trial of minor criminal cases that urgently need improvement. Article 306 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that the appeal period and the appellate court for judgments subject to appeal shall be announced together. This shows that the legislator attaches great importance to the defendant's right to appeal. Therefore, the court should give the defendant ample opportunity to consider. However, in a certain court, the inquiry of whether the defendant wishes to appeal is not made by the judge but by a court clerk or bailiff immediately after the judge announces the judgment. If the defendant is not a repeat offender, they may not even know what it means to "accept" or "not accept." Many vaguely agree and then regret it later. Whether the defendant appeals is related to the length of their detention pending judgment. The judge should carefully analyze and explain the advantages and disadvantages of appealing or not appealing, so that the defendant understands clearly, and then ask the defendant to express their intention to appeal or not appeal. This is the proper way. The Shanghai court is subject to scrutiny by both Chinese and foreigners, and such an important inquiry is actually performed by a court clerk or bailiff on behalf of the judge. While it may be convenient in practice to have the talent of resolving cases with a few words, what about the prestige of the court? This is one aspect that should be corrected.

Article 283 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that the presiding judge should, before announcing the conclusion of the debate, ask the defendant if they have anything to say. This is a right granted to the defendant by law and should not be neglected by the judge. However, the judge in a certain court often does not pay attention to this last inquiry to the defendant. This is another aspect that should be corrected.

Article 41 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that the record should be read to the person being questioned or shown to them for review, and they should be asked to sign or affix their fingerprint immediately after the last line of the record. However, it has been observed that in a certain court, the person being questioned is only asked to sign or affix their fingerprint, without being read or shown the record. Moreover, the person being questioned may not even know the purpose of their signature or fingerprint. This is another aspect that should be corrected.

It is common to see court clerks writing summaries of judgments beside the judge after the judge announces the judgment, while simultaneously having the defendant make a uniform cross on the delivery receipt. It is unknown whether this summary has been delivered to the defendant. If it has been delivered to the defendant, why is it not signed by the defendant themselves? This is another aspect that should be corrected.

Judges and lawyers share a common responsibility to uphold the spirit of justice. Having observed these issues, I dare not remain silent and specially submit this proposal, requesting that it be presented to the court for attention and correction. Your approval of its appropriateness is respectfully awaited. This is addressed to the Shanghai Bar Association.

Legal Questions

(Question) Man A and Woman B (both adults) mutually desire to marry, but Woman B's parents object and state that if she marries Man A, they will definitely persuade her to divorce him. Now, Man A and Woman B are participating in a group wedding, but the regulations require the signatures of both parties' parents. Since Woman B's parents object, it is difficult to obtain their signatures. Therefore, the following questions arise: (1) If Man A forges Woman B's parents' seal for the marriage certificate (Man A's seal is not a problem), is the certificate valid? (2) If Woman B's parents discover this and sue Man A for forging the seal, can the sentence be mitigated or can he be found not guilty according to the law? (3) If Woman B angers her parents as a result and they even announce her disownment in the newspaper or use other methods to declare her separation from the family, what are the legal provisions for this situation? If Woman B is indeed disowned by her parents, will her right to inherit their estate in the future still exist? (Gao Ji)

(Answer) (1) The fact that Man A forged Woman B's parents' seal on the marriage certificate does not render the entire certificate invalid. (2) If Man A's forgery of the seal causes damage to the public or others, he shall be held liable for the crime under Article 217, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. (3) The relationship between parents and children is based on blood ties and cannot be severed by legal acts. However, if the parents have a legitimate reason, they may, according to Article 1128 of the Civil Code, order their family members to separate from the household. (4) Whether Woman B loses her right to inherit depends on whether any of the circumstances listed in Article 1145, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code exist. In conclusion, since Woman B is an adult, she has the right to decide on her own marriage, and a marriage certificate is not a legally required document, so Man A should not forge a seal and violate the law. (Huang)

(Question) (1) Suppose A has two wives, each with one son. When the first wife died, her eldest son's name was inscribed on the ancestral tablet for worship. Later, the eldest son died, and then the eldest grandson died. According to local custom, after A dies, his great-grandson B should have his name inscribed on the tablet and issue funeral announcements, specifically enjoying a certain amount of sacrificial land. However, A had recorded in his diary that he was abolishing the great-grandson and replacing him with his second son C, and that the sacrificial land would also be given to him, with a draft funeral announcement attached. After A dies, C performs his duties according to his father's wishes, but B protests based on custom. (1) Does A's diary have the effect of a will? (2) Is B's protest reasonable? (3) Does C have the right to the title and enjoyment of the sacrificial land? (Tian Tong)

(Answer) (1) If it meets the requirements for a written will, it can take effect. (2) No. (3) Yes.

(Question) A has one son and one daughter. The son is married, and the daughter is married. A passed away four years ago, leaving a large estate. Two years ago, the son, based on a will, only gave his sister (i.e., the daughter) 200 yuan in silver. (1) Can the daughter now request a share of the estate from her brother? (2) What circumstances are considered an infringement of inheritance rights under Article 1146 of the Civil Code? (Zhang Lifu)

(Answer) (1) If the statute of limitations has not expired, she can request it. (2) There are various different circumstances. All those who should inherit but have not inherited are included. (Wu Guangding)

Brief Remarks

### The Merits and Demerits of Women's Inheritance Rights

— Xia

Before the implementation of the Civil Code, inheritance of parents' estates was limited to men. Therefore, those without sons had to adopt a son to carry on the family line, while biological daughters could not inherit. Later, due to the efforts of women's associations to advocate for gender equality, women were granted the same inheritance rights as men. This is a benefit. However, according to Article 1148 of the Civil Code, inheritance involves inheriting all rights and obligations of the deceased's property. Furthermore, Article 1153 of the same law states that heirs are jointly liable for the debts of the deceased. Therefore, if women obtain inheritance rights to parents with an estate, they can share it equally with their brothers. However, if they inherit from parents with debts and do not perform limited inheritance or renounce inheritance within the statutory period, the result will inevitably be that all of the parents' debts will be transferred to them. This is the demerit. However, there have been reports of brothers and sisters fighting over property, but there have been no reports of fighting over debts. Is this the true meaning of equality?

### The Evolution of "Serial Pictures"

— (Jun Xiang)

For Thirty or Forty Years, "Serial Pictures" Have Been Incessantly Infusing Readers with Potent Poison

"Serial pictures" are also known as "person books" or "small books." The reason why they have been popular for thirty or forty years, and welcomed by the general public and children, is twofold: firstly, the meaning of the pictures in "serial pictures" is straightforward, and the text portion is at least much clearer than that in "chapter novels," making it easy for ordinary people with limited education to fully understand; and secondly, the rental price of "serial pictures" is cheap, suitable for the economic capacity of ordinary people. In addition, most of the content of "serial pictures" is full of various kinds of "low-level interests," so their appeal is naturally quite large.

In the early days, "serial pictures," whether in form or content, were far inferior to those of later years: they were not continuous, mostly depicting one or two pictures from each chapter of a "chapter novel," fragmented and scattered, making it impossible to see the development and evolution of the entire story. The characters in the pictures were also drawn extremely crudely and simply, without background or explanation. The paper used was glossy paper, and the printing was extremely poor.

Later, "serial pictures" gradually began to improve. Firstly, in order to make the pictures more interesting and vivid, the authors of "serial pictures" connected the story content, allowing readers to get a clear overview of the entire story. Secondly, a "description column" was added above each picture, sometimes using the original text as the basis for the picture, and sometimes the authors themselves wrote a summary. Suitable backgrounds for the story's transformation were further added to each picture, and the art of drawing characters was much better than in the early days, but the paper was still glossy, and the printing naturally did not improve.

Recently, "serial pictures" have made great progress in form. The paper has been changed from eye-damaging glossy paper to newspaper paper. The drawings are more refined and artistic than in the past, and the descriptions have been changed by the authors to be more clear, popular, and easy for the public to fully understand.

In terms of form, "serial pictures" are indeed constantly improving. However, when we examine the evolution of the story content in "serial pictures" over the past thirty or forty years, we have little reason to be optimistic.

In the early days, the story content of "serial pictures" was not continuous. More elaborate ones would depict two pictures for each chapter, while simpler ones would mostly select a few of the most exciting and well-known segments of a story to draw. Therefore, a rather long story could only fill a thin little book. The authors themselves did not create, and the drawing was based on a few popular novels left by Ming and Qing novelists, with occasional adaptations from Peking opera.

In the second period of "serial pictures," although the stories were connected, the drawing was still based on a few popular chapter novels. Although there were also fresher works with Shanghai society as the theme, such as "Yan Ruisheng" and "Jiang Laowu's Martyrdom."

During that period, swordplay novels and movies were very popular. The authors of "serial pictures" saw through people's psychology of worshiping such superhuman heroes - swordsmen, so they fabricated many swordplay "serial pictures," gaining a large group of middle- and lower-class readers and infusing them with potent poison.

Even now, swordplay "serial pictures" still occupy two-thirds of the stalls, which is truly the most lamentable point in the "history of serial pictures."

The Emergence of Movie Stills

"Serial pictures" with popular novels as their theme were about to disappear due to the public's gradually waning interest in them, and "movie stills" took their place.

The emergence of "movie stills" has only been in the last two or three years. They have also attracted many readers. Many ordinary people who look down on movies see the content of each film through "movie stills." Now, almost every film has a "movie still" "serial picture" published within half a month of its release.

As for serial pictures created by the authors themselves that are in line with the current era, they are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, an absolute minority. I have only seen one, "Refugee Tears," which uses the Shanghai refugee circle as its theme.

The above is a brief report on the evolution of "serial pictures" over the past thirty or forty years. Strictly speaking, "serial pictures" over the past thirty or forty years have not only failed to take on the task of educating the public, but on the contrary, in order to boost sales, they have brought various potent poisons to the public - haven't we seen many pure and innocent children, after seeing the various forms of swordsmen in the pictures, become obsessed and want to run to some mountain or cave to find those sword immortals? Now that the War of Resistance has entered its second stage, "serial pictures" have not only failed to cooperate with the War of Resistance, but have redoubled their efforts to anesthetize the public.

It is said that a group of progressive painters are beginning to use "serial pictures" to cooperate with the War of Resistance and use them as a powerful tool to educate the public. I hope they will make some good achievements in the near future and set an example!

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 14: Thousands of Homes Benefit from Village Cooperation, Myriad Miles of Waves Witness Flight across the Sea

In the end, the cooperative store became even more impressive. People needed to obtain their daily necessities from the cooperative store, and to meet their needs, the store stocked an increasing variety of goods. At the end of that year, Zhu Aili calculated the number of goods sold in the store and found that there were over three hundred and forty-five kinds. He said with a smile, "People have always referred to those large general stores in cities as department stores. But in reality, they have more than a hundred kinds of goods. Even this small cooperative store of ours already has over three hundred kinds of goods. The reason is that there are many things we don't have here. Otherwise, with a little more flexibility, we could easily have a thousand kinds of goods and be called a 'thousand-goods store'." Originally, when they first started this cooperative store, they established a rule that they would not sell luxury goods. Moreover, the initial regulation was that items costing more than one yuan would not be sold. This was not only because they didn't sell luxury goods, but also because their capital was too small. If they were to sell items costing several yuan or more, they would quickly run out of working capital after stocking just a few dozen items. Later, after the capital was increased to one thousand yuan, they relaxed the rule to not selling items costing more than two yuan. In reality, the cooperative store never stocked luxury goods. For example, in the socks section, they only stocked cotton socks and thread socks, not silk stockings. In the soap section, they only stocked laundry soap, bath soap, medicated soap, etc., but not expensive floral-scented soaps. Other sections, such as the cosmetics section, also had some essential women's products. However, things like perfume costing several yuan a bottle, as well as novel and glamorous cosmetics, especially imported foreign goods, were strictly prohibited from being sold. Cigarettes were not sold at first, but later they were, because cigarettes have recently come under state control, becoming a state-owned enterprise and a public monopoly. This cooperative store gradually expanded, and a capital of one thousand yuan was no longer sufficient. But later, it became a custom that all villagers residing in Liberty Village had to buy shares, and everyone became a shareholder in the cooperative store. Even those who moved to Liberty Village from elsewhere had to buy shares and become a member of the cooperative store in order to enjoy the rights of this cooperative. Every shareholder of the cooperative store was given a booklet. If they wanted to obtain any goods, they could use the booklet to get them, and the accounts would be settled at the end of each month. However, the value of the goods taken could not exceed their share capital—one yuan—unless they had previously deposited funds in the cooperative store, in which case this limit did not apply. Every six months, the accounts would be settled, and all profits, after deducting expenses, would be distributed to the shareholders. Many such consumer cooperatives have now been established in China. The beauty is that the customers are also the shopkeepers, and the shopkeepers are also the customers, one and two, two and one.

### Sponsored by the Silver and Banking Industry Amateur Association: Exhibition of Fan Paintings by Famous Shanghai Artists

— Ying

Gathering Masterpieces of Renowned Figures from Shanghai's Art Scene in One Place

The Silver and Banking Industry Amateur Association – shouldn't this name be familiar to us? From tea servers, messengers, and veteran clerks to managers and bank presidents; from refugees crying for food in refugee camps to enthusiastic individuals presiding over disaster relief efforts, to all those who generously donated to the refugees, no one is unaware of this organization.

The reason is very simple and clear:

Because it is the only large group in the financial industry that has developed from its own members. It has been so in the past, it is so now, and it will continue to be so in the future. It tirelessly promotes the work efficiency, academic cultivation, leisure life, and welfare of employees in Shanghai's financial industry; at the same time, it has never forgotten the mission given to it by the times, namely the disaster relief work that Shanghai should be undertaking at present. Through ball games, drama performances, the highest level of enthusiasm from its members, and the painstaking efforts of its colleagues, it has always stood on the front line of disaster relief, constantly appealing and pleading for the suffering people.

Recently, it is hosting another exhibition of fan paintings by famous Shanghai artists.

Due to the environment, the original idea of using the proceeds from the sale of the works, either through commissions or entirely, for charity and disaster relief has been cancelled. It has been changed to replenish the funds for the calligraphy, painting, and seal engraving class of the Association's Academic Committee and the library, and to purchase medical and health equipment for the Welfare Committee.

Therefore, this "Exhibition of Fan Paintings by Famous Shanghai Artists" is different from ordinary fan painting exhibitions. It includes masterpieces by the top masters of the current Shanghai art scene, such as Wu Hufan, Wu Daiqiu, Qin Qinghui, Tang Dingzhi, Feng Chaoran, Zhao Shuru, Xu Bangda, and other gentlemen, as well as recent excellent works by well-known painters in the silver and banking industry, such as Pan Zixie, Ye Yuanqing, and Chen Zishou. Efforts are being made to actively solicit contributions from them. (Because there are many famous artists, they cannot all be listed.) Here, it is also necessary to add that the Association also hopes that those artists who may have been overlooked or forgotten to be solicited, and those who have an affinity for calligraphy and painting, will enthusiastically display their own and collected works in this exhibition.

The pre-determined target for collecting fan paintings is one thousand pages, and the exhibition location is the Association's headquarters at 334 Nanjing Road. The exhibition dates are from July 23rd to July 31st. The days are getting closer and closer. In these few days, not only all the staff of the Association's Academic Committee and Welfare Committee have been fully mobilized for this fan painting exhibition, actively carrying out their work. Even honorary directors of the Association, such as Xu Jijing, Wu Yunzhai, Zhu Boquan, Lin Kanghou, and Pei Yunqing, several senior figures in the financial industry, are extremely concerned and enthusiastic about this fan painting exhibition. In addition to serving as sponsors, they have also each agreed to write or paint two pages of fan paintings, making this exhibition even more impressive.

Wait and see: All art lovers, all those who wish to obtain a beautiful fan painting in the hot summer, this exhibition of fan paintings by famous Shanghai artists will give you a twelve-point satisfactory harvest! (Que Chou)

### Strong Man, Glamorous Woman

— Bai Hua

"Winner Take All"

Produced by 20th Century Fox, Screening at the Grand Theater

"Strong Man, Glamorous Woman" depicts how American boxing promoters speculate and deceive boxers, using them as tools to make money. This kind of theme is naturally not new to "Strong Man, Glamorous Woman." But in "Strong Man, Glamorous Woman," there is one point that makes us pay even more attention, that is, after the boxer Steve became famous, he did not restrain himself, became proud and dissolute, not knowing that his future would be completely destroyed in an instant. Therefore, it makes me think of recent rumors that many film industry employees went to gamble in the "badlands" of Western Shanghai, and after losing heavily, their behavior became improper, and they were dismissed by the company. These "rumors" may indeed be "groundless," but they are not without "clues." Let's not talk about anything else for the moment, but destroying one's own future with one's own hands is already such a terrible risk!

In terms of performance, the film's director can also remove redundant scenes and make the entire film develop smoothly. In the three boxing scenes, he tightly grasps the tense atmosphere at the time and analyzes the different emotions of each character. The first time: Steve replaced Boley in the ring, and was not noticed by the crowd. Only Gambini was overjoyed. When he struck, even Walker, who was running the boxing business, was shocked. The second time: When Steve was defeated, the director simultaneously depicted Gambini's disappointment after losing money, and Shirley's grief and shame. The third time: In a situation where everyone was ecstatic, Steve won a great victory. The director's handling of the atmosphere in these three different boxing scenes is indeed very skillful.

The character of Gambini is also successfully portrayed. He is simple-minded and easily emotional. His character is clearly outlined in every action. Naturally, Henry Armetta, who plays this role, is also an excellent actor.

Tony Martin, who plays Steve, is merely competent. Gloria Stuart, who recently visited Shanghai, plays Shirley, and her performance is average.

### Yan Lugong's Calligraphy in the Guoguang Art Journal

— Wu Hufan

Su Dongpo once said: "With Yan Lugong, the world's talents are exhausted." Yan's calligraphy was so highly regarded by the wise men of the past. When young children enter school, the teacher teaches them calligraphy, and they must take Yan Zhenqing (Gongquan), and Yan's style is more common than Liu Gongquan's, together becoming the standard for the world and future generations. Yan's calligraphy is robust and vigorous, upright and majestic, sweeping away the weaving and charming customs of the Six Dynasties and early Tang Dynasty, returning to simplicity, like Du Fu's poetry and Han Yu's prose, all suitable to be masters for a hundred generations. There are many ink rubbings handed down, but very few genuine works. Those that I have seen are the "Memorial to My Nephew Ji Ming," the "Yingzhou Post" in running script, and the "Autobiographical Imperial Edict" and the "Bamboo Mountain Couplet" in regular script. The "Memorial to Ji Ming" is now in the Forbidden City, the "Yingzhou Post" is in the Li family, and the "Imperial Edict" is in the Pu family, and they are not easy to see again. The "Bamboo Mountain Couplet" was previously collected by the Tibetan Ye family, and now it is appreciated by Mr. Zhang Shijian of Wuxing. Its calligraphy is very ancient and profound, majestic and unique, as if emerging from harsh self-cultivation, simple but not unrefined, unrestrained but not excessive, majestic like the heavy bronzes of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, compared with the calligraphy of Wang Xizhi and Yu Shinan, it still seems to be merely pursuing beauty.

Xu Bangda recently compiled the "Guoguang Art Journal," which collects and prints the traces of ancient bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and paintings to promote art and literature. His intention is excellent. The first page of the initial issue is the genuine work of Yan Lugong's "Bamboo Mountain," showing that he knows how to choose materials. In the past, Zhang's secret collection was treasured exclusively, but now the rare texts of the art world are appreciated together. His contribution is truly indelible, hence this record.
