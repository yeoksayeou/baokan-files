The Chinese army is unstoppable; the advancing troops have reached Huangsha Street. The Japanese army in Xinqiang is fleeing northward in extreme disarray. (Urgent telegram, 6th)

Guilin – At dawn today, the Chinese army recovered Pingjiang (note: this city fell on the 28th of last month). Another unit recovered Xiangyin Yingtian. The Chinese pursuing troops advanced to Huangsha Street (30 kilometers north of the Miluo River) this afternoon and began mopping up the Japanese army towards Xinqiang. (Urgent telegram, 5:30 PM, 6th) From Pingjiang – The Chinese pursuing troops advancing from Wengjiang engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army near Pingjiang on the evening of the 5th, enduring three hours of intense combat. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, retreated northward. The Chinese army officially recovered Pingjiang at 10 PM that night. (Urgent telegram, 6th)

Changsha – The Japanese army in northern Hunan has now begun a complete collapse. The Chinese pursuing troops completely wiped out the Japanese army struggling with their backs to the river on the south bank of the Miluo River on the evening of the 5th, recovering Yingtian, Miluo, Xinshi, Pingjiang, and other places. Another pursuing force also occupied Xianshi, Changshou Street, and other areas east of Pingjiang simultaneously. All of the Miluo River is under Chinese control, with no trace of the Japanese army. That evening, the Chinese army took advantage of its victorious might and strongly crossed the Miluo River to continue the pursuit, leaving the Japanese army no room to breathe.

Miluo – The Chinese army, which occupied Huanggu Cha this morning, continued to pursue the retreating Japanese army, reaching Dajing Street, 30 li to the northeast, and captured the area in one fell swoop this afternoon. Dajing Street is located between the Xinqiang and Miluo Rivers. Now that Huangsha Street on the railway front has also been recovered, the Chinese army, with these two opposing strongholds, can not only protect the Miluo River but also use them to recover the original positions on the south bank of Xinqiang. (Telegram, 9 PM, 6th)

Miluo – After the Chinese army recovered Baishui in Xiangyin, all units took advantage of the victory and advanced rapidly, recovering Yingtian, Miluo, Xinshi, and other key points on the evening of the 5th.

The Chinese pursuing troops crossed the river and advanced into Huangshi City (north bank of the Miluo Northern Tributary) on the morning of the 6th. Huangsha Street in the northern section of the Yuehan Railway was also recovered this morning. This place is only 30 li from Xinqiang, which can control the northwest of Lujiao and Jiuma Ji, and poses a major threat to the Japanese army on the south bank of the Xinqiang River. It is expected that the Chinese army will achieve even more remarkable feats between the two rivers. (Telegram, 6th)

Pingjiang – The Japanese army trapped in the Changshou Street and Xianshi areas was completely routed by the Chinese army after days of encirclement and annihilation.

Changde – At 8 AM this morning, a telephone call from Yuanjiang reported that after the Japanese troops invading northern Hunan were defeated and routed, the small groups of Japanese remnants occupying the east and west banks of the Xiang River were panicked and also tried to find an opportunity to escape. To cover the withdrawal of these remnants, two Japanese warships sailed from Heye Lake to Jia Port (north of Liuxingshan) across from Yingtian at 4 PM yesterday and shelled Huanshan in the Chinese with more than a dozen shells. In the evening, the Japanese army entrenched on Liuxingshan boarded the ships and fled. The Chinese army then recovered Liuxingshan. At 8 PM, a Chinese unit took advantage of the darkness and crossed the Xiang River, directly attacking the Japanese nest from behind. The 200-300 Japanese remnants entrenched there put up slight resistance and fled in a hurry, boarding Japanese ships and fleeing towards Yueyang. Yingtian was also recovered by the Chinese at 2 AM last night. With the Japanese troops in Liuxingshan and Yingtian cleared, there is no trace of the Japanese along the Xiang River. (Telegram, 6th)

(Telegram, 6th)

Gaoan – The Japanese army suffered heavy losses after being surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army at Ganfang Zhaoqiao. The remaining Japanese forces in the area are fleeing towards Jiuxianyang. The Chinese army is sending teams to track down and mop up. The Chinese army also discovered more than 300 Japanese corpses, more than 40 boxes of gasoline, and more than 40 boxes of bullets in the Shiwopu Mountains north of Jiuxianyang, as well as countless other military supplies, which the Japanese army did not have time to transport during their retreat. This shows the significant losses suffered by the Japanese army in northern Jiangxi. (Telegram, 6th)

Chongqing – According to a certain military authority, in the Battle of Northern Hunan, the Japanese army, with the Saito, Iyehisa, Amakasu, Fujita, and Ogiwara divisions, as well as special forces and naval landing forces, totaling tens of thousands of troops, coordinated by land, sea, and air. On one hand, they stirred up trouble in western Jiangxi in an attempt to contain the Chinese forces. On the other hand, they invaded southward along the northern section of the Yuehan Railway, attempting to take Changsha in one fell swoop. After starting to stir up trouble in northern Jiangxi on September 14, the Japanese army in northern Hunan launched a fierce attack on the Xinqiang River on the 23rd. At the same time, Japanese warships also entered the mouth of the Xiang River from Dongting Lake, operating on the flanks of the Chinese Xinqiang River and Miluo River positions. The Chinese army had long established its deployment in that area and was confident of success. Based on a set strategy, they adopted a defensive posture on the front while using powerful guerrilla forces in the Mufu Mountains to conduct flanking maneuvers, first inflicting significant losses on the invading Japanese army. Afterwards, they used necessary forces to defend the southern mouth of the Miluo River line, cleverly shifting the main force to the flank area, opening the front and luring the Japanese army deep into the pocket. The Japanese army fell for the trap and stuck its head into the bag. The Chinese army immediately seized the opportunity, using powerful forces to block Japanese reinforcements north of Pingjiang, while the forces south of Pingjiang unleashed their iron fists and launched a counterattack against the invading Japanese army. From the 27th to the 6th of this month, after more than ten days of fierce fighting, more than 30,000 Japanese soldiers were killed. Those who were wounded were unable to be transported to the rear due to the Chinese cutting off the rear lines. The remaining troops fled in disarray. The Chinese have crossed the Miluo River in pursuit, and advance pursuit units are lying in ambush. They are currently intercepting the retreating Japanese army in the area and launching an annihilation strike. Looking at the Battle of Northern Hunan, it is a larger defeat following the Battle of Suizao. The gains for the Chinese army and its contribution to the long-term war of attrition cannot be overstated. The rise and fall of the combat power of the Japanese and Chinese armies in this battle further solidifies the belief that the final victory is guaranteed. (Telegram, 6th)

### Sichuan Province New Grain Storage Plan

Chongqing – This year, Sichuan Province has reported a bumper harvest, and all parties are concerned that low grain prices will hurt farmers and affect people's livelihoods. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, with foresight, issued a telegram on August 22 to the Executive Yuan, instructing the responsible authorities to quickly purchase grain in large quantities in advance for relief. The Executive Yuan ordered the two ministries of finance and economy to comply. The Ministry of Economic Affairs then ordered the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to prepare. The Bureau prepared a draft outline of the Sichuan New Grain Purchase and Storage Plan in accordance with the spirit of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's original telegram and reported it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It was approved by the Executive Yuan meeting on September 26, and approved by Chairman Wei. The plan is divided into two parts: one is to handle transportation and sales, and the other is to handle storage. For storage, the more than 130 counties in Sichuan are divided into three grades: first-grade counties store grain worth 60,000 yuan per county, second-grade counties 50,000 yuan per county, and third-grade counties 40,000 yuan per county. In addition to the 1.67 million yuan to be raised by the central government, the storage funds will be handled by the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China. Regarding transportation and sales, the focus is on maintaining the minimum price, and supplementing surpluses and deficits is secondary. When the market price is lower than the standard price, purchases will be made at the standard price as much as possible. When the market price is higher than the standard price, purchases will be suspended. At the beginning of the implementation of the plan, each county must establish a People's Food Regulation Committee. The storage warehouses will be implemented by the committee in accordance with the instructions of the provincial agencies. According to the plan, X million shi of new grain will be transported and sold, X hundred X million shi will be stored in each county, and XXXXXX shi of military grain will be handled. Approximately XXXXXX shi of new grain can be purchased in Sichuan, equivalent to XXX hundred XX million dan, accounting for one-tenth of the total rice production in Sichuan. All warehouses, those used exclusively for storage, will be funded half by the Sichuan government, and the rest will be loaned by the Agricultural and Commercial Bank. Those used exclusively for transportation and sales, in addition to the Agricultural and Commercial Bank's existing warehouses, will be responsible for the establishment of warehouses as soon as possible. The total funds required are 15.416 million yuan, of which 7.67 million yuan will be allocated by the national treasury, 6.7 million yuan will be loaned by the four banks for storage funds, and all transportation and sales turnover will be handled by the four banks. The Agricultural and Commercial Bank is now waiting for Ji Zuyou to come to Chongqing from Rongcheng to discuss the implementation plan and will start handling it immediately. (Telegram, 5th)

Editorial

### Hitler's Speech

Hitler can be called a great orator without shame! His speech yesterday is really worth reading. After reading it, no one can say that his call for peace is not sincere, he really does not want war! Because Germany under the rule of the National Socialist Party, after years of military buildup and preparation to fulfill its desire for expansion, has created a huge Third Reich. But Germany does not have as large overseas colonies as Britain and France. Most of the raw materials for the military industry need to be imported from foreign countries, and its reserves are not as sufficient as those of Britain and France. He really is not suitable for war, let alone a long-term war. In terms of raw materials for the military industry, Germany needs to import 75% of iron sand, 80% of magnesium, 90% of kerosene and gasoline, 95% of copper, and 90% of lead from overseas, and it has no chromium (chromium) at all, so it needs 100%. The only raw material that Germany can supply itself is coal; but in fact, there are also problems. First, because Germany must use this to exchange some necessities lacking in Germany with its neighboring neutral countries. Second, because German workers are often in a state of idling. Third, because Germany lacks gasoline and rubber, etc., it has to use chemical methods to create artificial gasoline and artificial rubber. Coal is the main raw material for this compound; therefore, although the coal production is large, the consumption also increases. In addition, Germany's main coal-producing area is the Saar area, the current Western Front battlefield. Part of this coal-producing area has been occupied by France, and part has been destroyed by artillery fire, or at least targeted by artillery fire; in short, because of the Western Front war, it cannot all work as usual and supply as usual. After she occupied Poland, although part of it could be compensated by Poland's coal mines, how difficult is it for Polish miners to dig coal for the Germans to adapt to ideal efficiency! As for kerosene, Germany usually needs to consume more than 6 million tons per year; in wartime, it is estimated that it needs to consume 15 million to 20 million tons per year. Although the production of artificial gasoline can reach 2.5 million tons per year, it is still too far from the actual needs. These many material deficiencies are all factors that make Germany sincerely hope for peace. If Germany were rich in cash, it might not be difficult to avoid the enemy's blockade and purchase what it needs from various neutral countries; but unfortunately, this is almost like drawing a cake to satisfy hunger. It is said that at the beginning of this war, Germany only had 6 million pounds of gold reserves domestically and 10 million pounds of foreign exchange reserves abroad: how could this little amount be enough for war waste, let alone a long-term war?

Although the above figures were not published by the German side, so there may be some discrepancies with the actual situation, it is believed that they are not too far from the facts. In short, Germany's material resources are far inferior to those of Western European democratic countries, which is an undeniable fact. The British and French governments have repeatedly declared their determination to fight to the end and will defeat the National Socialist Party before they are finished. Regardless of what percentage of certainty such words have, or just express determination, but confronting each other on the front line is always a serious fact that Hitler cannot deny or avoid! Therefore, after winning Poland, and after Britain and France successively expressed their determination to fight, he did not completely respond to the enemies on the Western Front with the arrogance of a victorious hero; instead, he tried his best to use his strengths as a great orator, eloquently, to make up for the lack of material resources.

We observe from the side: we sincerely hope for an early peace in Europe, and sympathize with the endangered cultural heritage and millions of lives, and also acknowledge Hitler's sincerity in calling for peace, and every fragment of truth contained in his speech: if now is the early stage of the dispute between Germany and Britain and France, if now is the crossroads of war and peace, then this one speech alone can also hope to be effective; but we cannot help but regret that now is not the first page of the history of the dispute between Germany and Britain and France! In other words, if it were at the juncture of war and peace, peace might be found from this, but now it is difficult to end the war in the middle of the war!

### Hitler Delivers Speech, Presents Final Peace Proposal to Britain and France, Hold International Conference to Discuss General Solution, Delineate National Borders, Restore Poland According to Ethnicity Under German-Soviet Guarantee of Neutrality

Berlin - Führer Hitler delivered a speech at exactly 12 noon today, with very peaceful wording. Mr. Hitler suggested resolving the acute problems caused by the Polish conflict, as well as basic international issues such as armaments, international trade, currency issues, and international security, through an international conference. Mr. Hitler's speech lasted two hours. The first twenty minutes described the German army's victory in the German-Polish battle, then he turned his attention to discussing German-Soviet relations and common interests. It is said that this is a key point in the transformation of German foreign policy. The friendship between Germany and the Soviet Union proves that Germany has no ambition to seize a superior position in the world, nor the desire to conquer Ukraine or the Ural region. External accusations against Germany are unfair. He only mentioned the issue of completing the revision of the Treaty of Versailles, saying that the final stage of completing the revision of this treaty required bloodshed, which was against Germany's initial wishes. It is claimed that the purpose of German foreign policy is to clarify Germany's relations with other countries. Mr. Hitler also mentioned that Germany signed non-aggression pacts with the Baltic coastal countries and Denmark, and solemnly stated that Germany has no demands on Denmark or Belgium. Germany's border with Hungary and Yugoslavia will not change. He then solemnly stated that Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy have long-standing friendships and reaffirmed that Germany has no territorial demands on France, either now or in the future. Mr. Hitler further stated that the German government is committed to reaching an understanding with Britain, and said that he still believes that world peace cannot be achieved without completing this understanding. Then Mr. Hitler discussed the peace between Germany and Britain and France. It is claimed that he is willing to raise the following questions before the people of the world: Why must war break out in Western Europe? Is our war aim to restore Poland as created by the Treaty of Versailles? Mr. Hitler believes that this goal cannot be achieved. Then, is the Western European war our desire to destroy Germany? Even if this goal can be achieved, similar problems will occur in the world within five years. Mr. Hitler discussed the solution to the Eastern European problem, saying that Germany's borders will conform to historical and ethnic needs, and the problems of all ethnic minorities in Eastern Europe must also be resolved. The need to solve the Jewish problem was also discussed. Mr. Hitler then mentioned the issue of rebuilding Poland, but it must not be allowed to adopt an anti-German policy, and consideration will also be given to creating a sense of security in Europe. The German government is willing to explain that its foreign political goal is to acquire colonies, which is Germany's last demand. Germany is willing to cooperate in reducing armaments and advocates abolishing warfare against women and children. Only after the restoration of peace and the convening of an international conference to solve all the above-mentioned problems can it be meaningful. As for the impact of the war, not only will the participating countries suffer, but also the whole world. At the end of his speech, Mr. Hitler reiterated that what he said above was his final proposal, and said that if warmongers reject it, he will not hesitate to fight to the end. (6th, Huitong) Hitler said that the most urgent problems for Germany at present are to establish fair and lasting German borders, adjust the order of Eastern Europe, adjust the issue of the large number of Jews in that area, and create a Polish state, so that no danger will occur in the area. Mr. Hitler then listed Germany's five demands as follows: (1) Appropriately resolve Germany's borders based on ethnic and social conditions, appropriately adjust German territory and various ethnic groups in southeastern Europe, resolve the Jewish problem, rebuild trade relations between countries, and establish a Polish state, with Germany and the Soviet Union guaranteeing its neutrality.

### Hitler Praises War Achievements, Ridicules Poland for Misconduct

Berlin - When the Reichstag convened in the Kroll Opera House, National Socialist members in brown uniforms and uniformed military officers returning from the Polish front were everywhere. All foreign envoys attended, and the whole place was silent, completely different from the previous sessions when the whole place shouted "Long live". At 12:05 noon, Führer Hitler walked into the hall and took his seat among the government officials. The whole place stood up to pay respect. Then, General Göring, Speaker of the Reichstag, announced the opening of the session and delivered a brief speech, commemorating the fallen soldiers. (6th, Havas)

Berlin - When Führer Hitler delivered a speech to the Reichstag, he reviewed the achievements of the German army in the Polish war, regarding it as an "unprecedented victory in history". He pointed out that the combat achievements completed by the German army in 18 days would have taken 14 months to complete 25 years ago. Hitler emphasized the humane nature of the German army's operations. He said, "I forbid sacrifices that are not absolutely necessary." Regarding the occupation of Warsaw, there was no question that the German army would break Warsaw's resistance. The German army's achievements from September 25 to 27 could have been achieved from September 10 to 12, but he wanted to avoid the sacrifices of the first-line German troops and hoped that Poland would have the opportunity to show responsibility and common sense, so he repeatedly decided to extend the deadline for the Warsaw garrison to surrender the city and the deadline for civilians to evacuate. Bombers and heavy artillery teams were also often ordered to only bomb various military targets. "My suggestion not to bomb the Praga district was to reserve a place for civilians to evacuate. I made two decisions to strive for the evacuation of foreigners, and after various difficulties, I succeeded. The German army began its offensive on September 25, and the Warsaw garrison surrendered on September 27." Hitler praised the achievements of the German army's infantry, tanks, air force, and submarines. He said, "The military power of a country with 36,000,000 people was completely destroyed within four weeks, and the victor did not suffer a single defeat. This cannot be regarded as a blessing of luck, but as proof of training, leadership, and courage." Hitler cited two examples to prove this. (1) General Blaskowitz led a division and advanced towards Warsaw on the left wing of General Reichenau's army. At the time, it was thought that the Polish army had retreated to the Vistula River, but it was suddenly intercepted by the Polish army. The Polish army attacked the German army with infantry and cavalry. The exhausted German army resisted five or six times its strength and fought bravely while waiting for reinforcements. When the Polish army broadcast the news of victory, the besieged German army had already reported to me that it had stopped the Polish army's activities. (2) The Second Reserve Division was ordered to suppress the Polish army, force it to retreat to the northern "corridor", occupy Gdynia, and advance towards the Hel Peninsula. The division encountered resistance from the elite units of the Polish army, but eventually advanced step by step in a few days, capturing 2,000 Polish soldiers and occupying Gdynia. The remaining 4,700 troops of the Polish army were forced to retreat to the Hel Peninsula. When the councilors stood up to pay respect, Mr. Hitler announced the exact number of German casualties in the German-Polish war. According to the statistics on September 30, 10,572 officers died, 30,322 were injured, and 3,409 were missing. He then said that the fortresses of Warsaw and Modlin and the Hel Peninsula had all surrendered. The Polish campaign had in fact come to a halt. As a result of the war, the Polish army was completely defeated and the Polish state had disintegrated. 694,000 prisoners have set off for Berlin, and the captured spoils are still difficult to estimate.

Mr. Hitler then gave a detailed account of the history of Poland's founding and development after the European War. It is said that in 1919, the Poles claimed that Poles accounted for 95% of the residents in the land they demanded. Later, the results of the plebiscite proved that their statement was inaccurate. For example, in East Prussia, Poles only accounted for 2%.

Mr. Hitler also mentioned the abuse suffered by non-Poles, although 1.5 million Germans were forced to leave their families and were not allowed to carry essential items (such as clothing), Germany still established a tolerable relationship with Poland. Unfortunately, the Polish authorities made a mistake and thought this was a symbol of weakness.

After Mr. Hitler described the gradual increase in Poland's aggression against Danzig last spring, he still tried to reach an agreement with the Polish government. It is claimed that I thought about making it easier for the Polish government to accept our proposal and expressed to them that Germany was willing to guarantee Poland's independence, similar to the guarantee that Germany gave to Slovakia, but Poland refused. There are two reasons why Poland rejected Germany's proposal. (1) Poland harbored the ambition to occupy German territory and attempted to annex East Prussia, Pomerania, and Silesia, not only pushing the Polish border to the Oder River, but also as far as the Elbe River. (2) After Poland obtained the guarantees of Britain and France, although it was not threatened in any way, it brazenly provoked Germany, hoping to realize its ambition.

Hitler continued to describe Poland's atrocities against Germans, with many German villages being reduced to ruins and residents being brutally murdered, as well as other atrocities.

### Hitler Does Not Acknowledge Breach of Faith, Says He Is Determined to Lift the Constraints of the Treaty of Versailles

Berlin - Hitler said, "The authorities of Britain and France have repeatedly made statements, often using distrust of my promises as an excuse, but I have made promises to the German nation that they must be freed from the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles and restore their rights that are vital to their survival. I have fulfilled this promise. When foreign politicians accuse me of breaking faith, I protest because of this." (6th, Havas)

### Poor Response from Britain and France

London - After Führer Hitler's speech in the German Reichstag was broadcast here by radio, the reaction from British political circles was very simple. They all said that the speech did not contain any new elements, and the so-called peace offensive was not as great as generally expected, nor did it provide any guarantees for the future situation. In general, people did not think it was different. In short, this speech "has no value at all." (6th, Havas)

Paris - After Führer Hitler's speech in the German Reichstag was transmitted here, the first reaction of French officials was that Hitler was repeating his old tricks, in other words, after each new incident, he repeatedly declared that there were no more demands, and other countries did not need to have any doubts, and that there were still some details to be resolved. His argument was nothing more than "As far as Poland is concerned, please let me and the Soviet authorities do whatever we want. The Baltic coastal countries have been assigned to the Soviet Union, and I have no demands. I did not fight against Poland, but Poland was the aggressor." In this way, the long-proclaimed peace plan contributes very little to the current situation. Although Germany is prepared to make peace, it must be allowed to do whatever it wants with the lands it has conquered and organize Southeastern Europe according to its own interests. That's all. As for Hitler's claim that he no longer has any territorial ambitions in Europe, it is also a well-worn phrase. He solemnly made this promise at the Munich Conference before he annexed Czechoslovakia. He also said this when he and the Soviet Union divided Poland. He did not provide any promises for the future situation, which is not in line with the prerequisites put forward by the governments of Britain and France. Britain and France can only remember his violations of faith and deal with them accordingly. (6th, Havas)

### Soviet Union and Latvia Also Sign Mutual Assistance Treaty, Soviet Union Obtains the Right to Station Troops on Land, Sea, and Air, Will Sign Similar Treaty with Lithuania

Moscow - Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov and Latvian Foreign Minister Menders began negotiations on the issue of concluding a mutual assistance agreement between the Soviet Union and Latvia on October 2. Those participating in the event on the Soviet side were Stalin, Potemkin, and Soviet Ambassador to Latvia Zotov. On the Latvian side were Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kosins. As a result, the mutual assistance treaty was signed on October 5. (5th, TASS)

Moscow - The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the President of the Republic of Latvia, in order to develop the friendly relations established by the Treaty of Peace between the two countries of August 11, 1920, based on the principles of recognizing each other's national independence and non-interference in internal affairs, recognize the Treaty of Peace of August 11, 1920, and the Treaty of Mutual Non-Aggression and Peaceful Settlement of Conflicts of February 5, 1932, as the solid foundation of the friendly relations and obligations between the two sides, and jointly believe that it is in the interests of both countries to clearly state the concrete conditions for guaranteeing each other's security. Therefore, they determined that it was necessary to conclude the following mutual assistance treaty, and each appointed plenipotentiary representatives. On the side of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the plenipotentiary representative was Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union. On the side of the President of the Republic of Latvia, the plenipotentiary representative was Foreign Minister Menders. The two plenipotentiary representatives, after proving their qualifications to each other, met and agreed on the following conditions:

Article 1. The two Contracting States undertake to provide each other with all assistance, including military assistance, in the event that the sea borders of the two countries in the Baltic Sea, or the borders adjacent to the two Republics of Estonia or Lithuania, and the bases specified in Article 3, are directly invaded or threatened with invasion by any major European power.

Article 2. The Soviet Union undertakes to assist the Latvian army with armaments and other military equipment under favorable conditions.

Article 3. In order to safeguard the security of the Soviet Union and consolidate its own independence, the Republic of Latvia grants the Soviet Union the right to lease land in the towns of Liepāja (Liepāja) and Ventspils (Ventspils) at reasonable rents to establish naval bases and several airfields. The exact addresses and boundaries of these bases and airfields shall be designated by mutual agreement. In addition, in order to guarantee the Irbe Strait, the Soviet Union is also invited to establish coastal defense batteries along the coast between Ventspils and Pitrags under the same conditions. In order to protect the above-mentioned naval bases, airfields, and coastal defense batteries, the Soviet Union may station land and air forces in the designated locations at its own expense, with an absolute limit on the number of personnel. The maximum number of personnel shall be stipulated in a special agreement.

Article 4. The two Contracting States undertake not to conclude or participate in any alliance or group that is hostile to either Contracting State.

Article 5. The implementation of this Treaty shall not in any way affect the sovereignty of the two Contracting States, and they shall be allowed to maintain their state organizations, economic and social systems, and military facilities. The locations designated for the establishment of naval bases and airfields in Article 3 shall remain the territory of the Republic of Latvia.

Article 6. This Treaty shall come into effect after the exchange of instruments of ratification. This exchange of instruments shall be carried out in Riga within six days from the date of signing. This Treaty shall be valid for ten years. Unless one of the Contracting States considers it necessary to cancel it one year before the expiration, it shall automatically be extended for ten years thereafter.

The two plenipotentiary representatives have signed and confirmed this Treaty. It was established in Moscow on October 5, 1939, in two copies in Russian and Latvian. (6th, TASS)

Moscow - Molotov hosted a banquet last night to entertain Menders. During the banquet, Molotov and Menders exchanged toasts, and the atmosphere was exceptionally harmonious. On the same day, Menders and Gan set off from Moscow to return to their country. National flags of the two countries were hung all over the station, and there was a guard of honor to see them off. (6th, TASS)

Kaunas, Lithuania - Foreign Minister Urbšys returned to the country yesterday from Moscow, reporting on his talks with Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov, and will go to Moscow again. According to informed sources here, the Soviet Union wants Lithuania to sign a mutual assistance treaty with it, and has designated two places as Soviet air force bases. (5th, Havas)

### Soviet Troops Withdraw from Lithuanian Bulge

Berlin - According to official news agencies, Soviet troops have now withdrawn from the bulge on the border between East Prussia and Lithuania in accordance with the German-Soviet agreement. German troops will be able to take over completely on Saturday. Lithuania's border with Germany will then be twice as long as it was before the partition of Poland. The German-Soviet committee for demarcating the new border agreed that after the Soviet troops withdrew on Thursday, German infantry and engineering units would cross the border from four places. It is also claimed here that the last remaining 8,000 Polish troops surrendered to German troops at Kok, east of Diebelin, at 10 a.m. today. (6th, Reuters)

### Neutral Zone Established Along US Coast

Washington - British Ambassador to the United States Lothian has asked US Secretary of State Hull to explain the significance of the neutral zone demarcated by the Pan-American Conference. After a journalist asked Hull whether this announcement contained any threatening meaning, Hull replied that the 21 republics of the Americas had agreed that if any belligerent state did not accept or comply with its decision, the 21 republics would consult with each other on how to deal with it. According to this, the neutral zone extends from the coast of the New World to the sea, in some places as far as 600 miles. Hostile or belligerent acts are not allowed in this area. (6th, Reuters)

London - After the Pan-American Conference passed the "Declaration of Panama" and decided to establish a safe zone within 300 miles of the coast of the Americas, British naval officials refused to express their opinions because they had not yet received more detailed information, only saying that it would be beneficial and harmless to demarcate a large safe zone on the sea.

### German Submarine Sunk by French Oil Tanker, British Navy Intensifies Search of the Sea, Ship Accidents Have Been Greatly Reduced

According to current information from Paris, a French oil tanker has sunk a German submarine. It is said that after the submarine was hit, a terrible vibration occurred, and then oil stains were found on the nearby sea. (6th, Reuters)

Paris - A French oil tanker sank a German submarine yesterday. People were surprised when they heard about it. According to the shipowner, when the ship was sailing to a certain sea area at 6:30 p.m. yesterday, it found what looked like a submarine in front of it, so it quickly changed its direction of advance. In a short while, a loud bang was heard, and the ship was suddenly hit violently, followed by an explosion. The whole ship was shaken incessantly, and at the same time, waves splashed on the deck. Soon after, a vortex appeared on the sea, and a large amount of gasoline floated up. In an instant, all was silent. It was then known that a submarine had been sunk. Naval experts said that this matter is very easy to understand, because in order to avoid attacks from enemy warships and airplanes, submarines are often unwilling to constantly expose their periscopes to the surface of the water, so after catching a glimpse of an enemy ship, they often immediately sink in order to sneak to the vicinity of the ship they are preparing to attack, and then launch torpedoes. However, if the ship that is becoming the target of attack suddenly changes its course, the submarine is very likely to collide with it while secretly advancing, causing it to sink itself. Yesterday's event was probably like this. (5th, Havas)

London - The Ministry of Information recently issued a public statement stating that since the British Navy has stepped up its search for German submarines, the number of ship accidents in this country has been decreasing day by day. In summary, in the first week of the war, the tonnage of ships in this country that were sunk totaled 85,000 tons, in the second week it decreased to 46,000 tons, in the third week it decreased to 21,000 tons, in the fourth week it decreased to 9,000 tons, and in the fifth week it was only 876 tons. It can be seen that the various measures taken by the naval authorities are truly effective. Although the German side issued news that German submarines had been attacked by British armed merchant ships and falsely accused British merchant ships of becoming disguised destroyers, none of these were accurate. It is clear that the country's slander in this way is intended to create new excuses to continue attacking British merchant ships and ships of various neutral countries. As far as the current situation is concerned, it is credible that half of the country's submarines operating at sea have been lost. As for the pirate ship that appeared once on the sea off the coast of Brazil, there has been no trace of it so far. The British Navy has taken various secret measures to wipe out pirate ships when they are encountered. (5th, Havas)

### "Iroquois" Returns from Europe, US Receives Warning from Germany, Clearly a German Propaganda Strategy

Washington - The White House announced last night that German Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder formally warned the US government that the "Iroquois," which is currently carrying American expatriates back to the country, will suffer the same fate as the "Athenia" when it approaches US territory. According to a report from President Secretary O'Leary, Admiral Raeder said that the information he obtained came from reliable sources. Germany's intention in this move is to push the responsibility for the "Athenia" sinking case to Britain and France, saying that after Britain and France sank ships carrying American expatriates, they publicized that this was done by the German side, the common intention of which was to drag the United States into the Allied forces to fight. O'Leary said that the US government does not take this warning very seriously. The government has instructed the captain of the "Iroquois" to be extra vigilant and has sent a cruiser to escort the voyage. The "Iroquois" left Ireland on October 2, and all passengers were American expatriates. The German Embassy here said that it had not received any news about this matter. (6th, Associated Press)

Washington - Germany warned the United States that someone was trying to sink the American ship "Iroquois" near the American coast. The news was quite shocking here, but the government believed that this was an extraordinary propaganda strategy, because Germany surmised that American public opinion had already believed the previous German claim that the American ship "Athenia" was sunk by a British ship. However, Americans clearly did not believe it, so Washington found it strange that Germany would make this new propaganda on the basis of having lost credibility in order to gain something. It is now known that the "Iroquois" carries a total of 584 passengers and crew members, all of whom are Americans. (6th, Reuters)

### Western Front Quiet; German Army Preparing for Large-Scale Frontal Assault on French Maginot Line

Paris - General Headquarters announced in its 63rd war bulletin, "Reconnaissance units of both enemy and our forces were engaged in various locations today. Other than that, the entire front was quiet." (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Paris - The focus of attention on the Western Front has shifted to the Mersch and Saar corridors east of Luxembourg. The French army's raid near the Luxembourg border has completely occupied the Borg Forest, and assault troops have consolidated their captured positions. The German army is desperately trying to prevent the French from continuing their advance in the western part of this corridor for two reasons: (1) A French advance would threaten any German plans to violate Luxembourg's neutrality and greatly reduce the space for German maneuvering; (2) If the French were to reach the outskirts of Boulay, six miles from the French border, the forward defenses of the Siegfried Line to the south would be weakened and vulnerable to a flank attack by the French. Some new German tanks are equipped with six-inch guns, apparently intended for attacking artillery forts. Therefore, observers now believe that the German General Staff may prefer a large-scale frontal assault on the Maginot Line rather than a flanking maneuver through neutral countries. A French war bulletin issued last night stated that the front was quiet all day, with reconnaissance patrols active at various points. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### India Forms Two Air Force Squadrons to Aid Britain in War

London - The Information Department announced that the Indian government has formed two active and reserve air force squadrons to assist Britain in the war. Mr. Fraser, New Zealand Cabinet Associate and Education Minister, will come to London to attend the Imperial Conference. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Amsterdam - According to news from the Indian capital, the Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, had another lengthy discussion with Gandhi yesterday, discussing the current international situation. It is reported that Gandhi will report the content of the talks to the Indian National Congress. The Viceroy then met with Indian Muslim leaders for discussions. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)

### Seventeen British and Swedish Cargo Ships Detained in Soviet Territory

Moscow - According to authoritative sources, twelve British and five Swedish ships, carrying cargo to England, have been detained by Soviet authorities in the port of Murmansk. It is claimed that the Soviet Union is taking this measure based on a decree issued by the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on September 9, which stipulates that if a country takes measures unfavorable to Soviet international trade, the Soviet Union will detain cargo bound for that country. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)

### Americans Sympathetic to China Promote "Bowl of Rice" Movement to Raise Funds for Chinese Refugees

Havas News Agency, New York dispatch - The Chinese Refugee Relief Association launched a "Bowl of Rice" movement in major American cities last year to raise donations, with very good results. It is now scheduled to conduct this campaign again in October, with an earnest appeal from the president, Mr. S. Roosevelt (nephew of the late President Roosevelt), requesting the sincere support of people from all walks of life. He stated, "Liuzhou City in Guangxi Province, China, was wantonly bombed by 27 Japanese aircraft in September of this year, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries. There were no surgical instruments available to treat the injured. The suffering of Chinese civilians is evident from this. They desperately need minimal relief from the terror from the sky. More than 50 million people are homeless in China. It is our bounden duty to rescue them from their plight." From this, it can be seen that although the European war has caused anxiety in the United States, the Chinese refugee relief work has not been affected.

### Germany Forbids Listening to Foreign Broadcasts; Secret Police Use Tricks to Arrest People

Paris - The Paris Evening News quotes a telegram from Souletique, claiming that German secret police have adopted new tricks to arrest Germans who listen to foreign broadcasts. They place small advertisements in German newspapers stating, "A shop sells used radios that can receive signals from all European stations." Anyone who goes to the shop to buy a radio is seized by two policemen. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

### Opposition to the Ministry of Trade Movement; Japanese Political Strife Expands; All Ministry of Foreign Affairs Staff Resign

Tokyo - All section chiefs and administrative officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a board meeting on the morning of the 5th and decided to resign en masse, urging Foreign Minister Nomura to streamline diplomacy and handle matters properly. In the afternoon, all bureau chiefs and 250 subordinate officials also joined. The movement against the establishment of a Ministry of Trade has spread to all administrative staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Taniguchi Masashi summoned representatives of the administrative authorities at 3:30 p.m., stating that he would strive to realize everyone's hopes within the scope of matters decided by the cabinet, and hoping that everyone would not act rashly. However, the representatives rejected this statement and resigned. The section chiefs and administrative officials then held a plenary meeting starting at 5:30 p.m., resolving to submit suggestions to the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. The issue is gradually expanding and becoming more complicated.

Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today published news about the internal strife in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in prominent positions. It is reported that all personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including 300 lower-level staff, have resigned. Yesterday afternoon, a four-member committee representing the civil servants met with Foreign Minister Nomura, explaining in detail that the establishment of a separate Ministry of Trade completely disregards the inseparable nature of overseas politics and economic diplomacy, and therefore, from a national policy standpoint, it is absolutely unacceptable. Nomura should reconsider his attitude and insist to the cabinet on the necessity of diplomatic unification. Nomura replied that he could not accept this view and that the opponents were overstepping their duties as civil servants. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Tokyo - It is reported that the Cabinet is taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the internal strife in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Semi-official circles here believe that Foreign Minister Nomura will be able to resolve this dispute satisfactorily. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs convened a meeting of staff representatives at 11:30 last night, urging them to resume their duties as usual and accept the Cabinet's adopted procedure of establishing a Ministry of Trade. After the meeting, Foreign Minister Nomura made the following statement to reporters: "I listened to the opinions of the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs staff for more than an hour and expressed my views. However, the attitude of some younger staff members still seems very strong. I do not know if I can persuade them. Although I cannot say for certain that there will be a serious conflict, I am prepared to deal with the situation no matter what." (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Tokyo - Foreign Minister Nomura will meet with Prime Minister Abe this morning to discuss the incident of more than 300 staff members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs resigning due to the establishment of the new Ministry of Trade, and to submit the resignation letters of the resigning personnel. "Asahi Shimbun" criticized the incident today, saying that the government will not change its decided policy and will establish the Ministry of Trade as soon as possible. According to the "Chugai Commercial News," Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Mr. Kawai has refused to accept the appointment as ambassador to Thailand. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### Thirty-Nine American Warships Sail to Hawaii

Los Angeles - It was previously reported that 45 American warships were ordered to sail to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. It is now known that 39 of them sailed to Hawaii on Thursday morning, including the aircraft carrier "Enterprise," carrying 80 aircraft, 6 heavy cruisers, 1 light cruiser, and 31 destroyers. (American Press dispatch, 6th)

San Diego - Thirty-nine American warships, carrying 106 aircraft and accompanied by a large number of fleet reconnaissance troops, sailed to Hawaii late last night. After arriving at Pearl Harbor, the naval concentration in Hawaii will be the most substantial ever, except during major exercises. According to official sources, this action has been under consideration for several months and is for training purposes. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### Hitler Visited Warsaw Yesterday; Reviewed the Invading Polish Troops; Issued a Letter of Consolation to the Soldiers; Returned to Berlin by the Same Plane that Evening

Berlin - According to a report from a special correspondent of the German News Agency regarding Führer Hitler's inspection of Warsaw, Hitler departed from Berlin by plane early yesterday morning and arrived at the Warsaw Central Airport at 11:30 a.m. after a two-and-a-half-hour flight. German Army Commander-in-Chief von Brauchitsch, Air Force Chief Milch, Army Commander Rundstedt, Army Commander List, Air Force Commander Loehr, Kesselring, Warsaw Garrison Commander Lieutenant General Kitzinger, and others welcomed him at the airport. All the generals wore the Iron Cross medals they had recently received for their meritorious service in the Polish campaign. After Hitler inspected the honor guard, he stepped out of the airport to the sound of the German national anthem and went to the Skola command headquarters. After a short meeting, Hitler drove to visit the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the "European Hotel," and the diplomatic residence area of Ujazdowskie Avenue. Most of the city was not damaged. Hitler then reviewed the German troops at the command platform built in the middle of the street. The troops paraded for two hours. After the review, Hitler went to pay his respects at "Belweder," the former residence of the late Polish President Marshal Piłsudski. The interior and exterior were intact, and Piłsudski's military uniforms were on display. Hitler seemed deeply moved by this Polish general who advocated German-Polish peace. Hitler then returned to the airport and returned to Berlin by the same plane that evening. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)

Berlin - Führer Hitler and the supreme commanders of the German army issued the following letter of consolation to the soldiers on the Eastern Front yesterday: "Soldiers on the Eastern Front, in early September you protected Germany from Poland. Today, the army, navy, and air force have all fulfilled their military duties. Today, I take this opportunity to congratulate you on the victory of Warsaw. The German military operation in Poland demonstrated the good military spirit of German soldiers everywhere. The people of the whole country are delighted with your meritorious service to the country. The previous European war sacrificed 2 million soldiers. Today, your victory makes the future of Germany unshakeable. Marching forward under the same national flag, I believe that you will be loyal to the country and serve the country at any time." [Hitler's Seal], October 5, 1939. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)

### Full Text of Hitler's Speech (Continued) (Continued from Page 4)

German women and children in villages were also abused and massacred. If one percent of these atrocities had occurred in British territory, British gentlemen would have condemned it in hypocritical and horrified tones.

Hitler continued that Poland had mistaken Germany's tolerance for weakness and believed that Germany's concessions indicated that it could continue to invade. Poland also misunderstood the German government's sense of responsibility and the German leader's determination to reach an understanding.

German-Soviet Agreement

The foundation of the German-Soviet treaty is based on common interests. Not only do the two countries have the same relevant issues, but both countries also recognize the need to cooperate with each other. Since Stalin does not consider Sovietism an obstacle to establishing friendly relations with other political ideologies, there is no reason for National Socialist Germany to take a different path. The two countries respect each other's different ideologies and systems, and there is no longer any reason for hostility. The German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact is a turning point in Germany's entire foreign policy. The two countries can not only maintain peaceful relations but can also cooperate permanently. Germany is not striving for world hegemony, nor does it want to seize the Ural Mountains, Ukraine, Romania, or other territories. The German-Soviet agreement can prove this. Disputes cannot be allowed to arise between Germany and the Soviet Union, so the boundaries of spheres of influence have been delineated, and each maintains security and order within its sphere of influence while avoiding harming the interests of other countries. Germany's tasks within its sphere of influence are as follows:

(1) Establishing German borders, taking into proper consideration historical, ethnic, and economic conditions.

(2) Pacification work, ensuring the security of German territory and the security of Germany's sphere of influence.

(3) Most importantly, establishing a new order based on racial needs, allowing all ethnic groups to obtain more reasonable ethnic boundaries.

Hitler said that the German people are scattered throughout Eastern and Southeastern Europe, are not easily assimilated, and must adopt a long-term policy to establish a new European order and eliminate potential friction. Germany and the Soviet Union have agreed to mutually assist in resolving this issue.

Land Demands

Hitler reviewed Germany's relationship with the League of Nations, believing that the League was a tool for maintaining the Treaty of Versailles. He said, "If 46 million British people can demand to rule 40 million square kilometers of land, then 82 million German people's demand for 800,000 square kilometers of land and the return of colonies should not be considered inappropriate. Germany's demands are limited to the most vital survival interests. If the natural survival interests of the German people are not directly threatened, I will advise the German people to abandon their demands. All countries in the world desire peace, and none are as eager as Germany.

Relations with Other Countries

At this point, Hitler discussed Germany's relations with its neighbors and the great powers, analyzing and discussing them as follows:

(1) Germany has concluded non-aggression treaties with the Baltic states, and their interests are purely economic.

(2) Germany has no disputes with the Nordic countries in the past or today. Germany would have proposed signing non-aggression treaties with Sweden and Norway, but those two countries believed that they were not threatened and did not need to conclude them.

(3) Germany has no old grievances with Denmark. Although the Treaty of Versailles would have ceded a portion of German territory to Denmark, Germany and Denmark later resolved their differences and signed a non-aggression treaty.

(4) As for German-Dutch relations, they have always been harmonious, and there have never been any differences between the two countries.

(5) Since I came to power, Germany has strived to strengthen relations with Belgium. I have abandoned any demands on Belgium, even the intention to make demands at all.

(6) As for Yugoslavia, after I annexed Austria, I guaranteed it that the German-Yugoslav border was the final border. Germany will maintain peace with Yugoslavia forever.

(7) Germany adopts the exact same attitude towards Switzerland as it does towards Belgium. There has never been any doubt regarding the friendship of the two countries.

(8) Germany and Hungary have a traditional friendship, and the German-Hungarian border will never change.

(9) When Slovakia became independent, it automatically requested German support, and Germany recognized its independence.

(10) Regarding the great powers, first discuss German-Italian relations. It is forcefully stated that the German-Italian border has been solemnly guaranteed and will never change. The enemies of the World War have become the closest allies, concluding a covenant based on ideology and politics, becoming a

(11) Regarding France and Germany, efforts have been made to eliminate the bad atmosphere, hoping to create a situation that is tolerable to both sides. Therefore, the Alsace-Lorraine issue is never mentioned. No French politician can say that Germany has made demands on France.

(12) As for British-German understanding, it has been my life's goal. Even today, I still believe that there can be no peace in Europe unless British-German relations improve. Based on this belief, I decided to take the path of peaceful negotiations. If it fails, the responsibility does not lie with me. At this point, Hitler raised a major question, investigating the cause of the war on the Western Front:

(1) Will it be for the restoration of Poland under the Treaty of Versailles? I solemnly declare today that the Versailles policy can never be revived. With Germany and the Soviet Union guaranteeing this, the Polish issue should be decided entirely by Germany and the Soviet Union.

(2) Has Germany made any demands that endanger the interests of the British Empire? I firmly say no. I have never made any demands on Britain or France.

Current Problems

Hitler continued that the current problems are nothing more than two: one is to resolve the problems caused by the disintegration of Poland, and the other is to eliminate the international difficulties that endanger the political and economic survival of all countries. Germany believes that the following six steps must be taken to rebuild order in the area west of the German-Soviet dividing line:

(1) Creating Germany's historical, geographical, and economic borders.

(2) Reorganizing the living space based on ethnic principles.

(3) Attempting to adjust the Jewish question.

(4) Reorganizing economic life and improving transportation convenience.

(5) Ensuring the security of the area.

(6) Establishing a plot-free area within the territory to threaten German-Soviet relations. Germany's goal in adjusting the entire European situation is twofold: on a smaller scale, to establish order politically and reorganize economically in the center of European turmoil; on a larger scale, the entire Europe must first establish a sense of security. To achieve this goal, first, all countries must frankly state their diplomatic objectives. Germany's diplomatic objective, in a nutshell, is: "Abolish the Treaty of Versailles." There is nothing else to seek.

As for the colonial issue, Germany is appealing based on fair principles and economic common sense, not wanting to threaten with force. Second, to achieve the goal of adjusting the entire world's peace, international trade and transportation must be developed, and the production of all countries must be adjusted to meet actual needs. Markets and currencies must be reorganized so that obstacles to the exchange of goods and free trade can be gradually removed. Third, and most importantly, is the absolute guarantee of peace and the establishment of a sense of international security. Among these, disarmament is the most prerequisite. I have repeatedly proposed motions on this issue in the parliament, but they have all been rejected, probably because I proposed them. I firmly believe that Europe can only restore a sense of security after international agreements define the legal and illegal use of armaments. The Geneva Protocol prohibits (A) killing wounded soldiers, (B) abusing prisoners of war, (C) attacking non-combatants, (D) using poison gas, (E) using submarines, and stipulates the types of prohibited items. Indeed, the methods of modern warfare are becoming increasingly terrible and must be abolished. In the Polish war, I tried to limit air warfare, only bombing military targets, and drafting effective international regulations is certainly possible. Europe can maintain peace, and the foundation for economic prosperity can also be established. I do not believe that there are responsible politicians in Europe who do not want their people to enjoy prosperity. This wish must be realized by the cooperation of European countries. Those who work for the future of the nation should aim to assist this cooperation. To achieve this great goal, the major European powers will one day jointly draft solutions so that all countries have a sense of security, tranquility, and peace. However, preparatory work must be carried out before this meeting is held. This meeting can never be held amidst the sounds of cannons. The continuation of the status quo on the Western Front is unimaginable. The number of daily sacrifices will inevitably increase. If one day France attacks Saarbrücken and destroys it, then Germany will destroy Mülhausen. If the French army advances and attacks Freiburg, then the German army will retaliate in Strasbourg. In other words, the artillery of both countries will penetrate deeper and deeper into the other country. If that is the case, some international journalists will find it interesting, and aircraft merchants and arms dealers will make huge profits. However, the people will suffer, and the suffering of the victims will be unspeakable. In the future, there will be new territories between Germany and France, but they will not be prosperous cities but ruined wastelands. The reason I make this argument is to hope that our people can escape the suffering of war. If I cannot persuade Churchill and his followers, then this is my last statement. We have no choice but to fight to the end.

### US Senate Heatedly Debates Neutrality Amendment Bill; Stimson Broadcasts to the Nation, Advocating Repeal of Arms Embargo

Washington - President Roosevelt's secretary, Mr. O'Leary, answered questions today, saying that the Senate seems to be inclined to vote in favor of the government's Neutrality Act, which is very gratifying. Senator Walter George, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted that the Senate would consider amending the two points of shipping restrictions and 90-day credit. When the Senate resumed debate, Republican Mr. Nye and Democrat Mr. Overton both spoke against the repeal of the arms embargo. Mr. Nye demanded that the government implement the cash-and-carry bill without repealing the embargo. Mr. Overton claimed that repealing the embargo was tantamount to armed intervention in the European war. Democrat Mr. Schwertner defended his statement, saying that the government's Neutrality Act is the most complete and orderly method of avoiding war ever implemented by any country. If Congress does not intentionally want to involve the United States in the European war, then the best way to do so is to pass the current bill. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Washington - The Senate continued its debate today on the Neutrality Act amendment bill proposed by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Dupe, a Republican isolationist stalwart, delivered a speech strongly opposing the repeal of the arms embargo clause, advocating that the original bill be divided into two parts: one concerning restrictions on domestic trade with belligerent countries, and one concerning the repeal of the arms embargo clause, and then voted on separately. The isolationist senators supported this proposal, hoping to use this tactic to pass the first bill, namely the clause on "cash transaction, transportation on their own responsibility," and reject the second bill, namely allowing arms to be shipped to belligerent countries. The government senators, on the other hand, believed that if the original bill were divided into two, it would have to be sent back to the Foreign Relations Committee for review, which would inevitably delay the process, and they would do their best to avoid it. In addition, Republican Senator Nye (also a leader of the isolationist faction) supported the implementation of the "cash transaction, transportation on their own responsibility" method, but opposed the repeal of the arms embargo clause as a condition for exchange, believing that this would endanger American peace. Democratic Senator Overton also made the same argument, which was immediately refuted by the original proposer, Senator Pittman, who strongly argued that the current Neutrality Act is not neutral, and that its nature is beneficial to continental countries and not to maritime countries; also, its content prohibits the shipment of arms to belligerent countries, but does not prohibit the export of cotton or other goods used for war. At this point, Democratic Senator Schwertner stood up to defend the Pittman bill and put forward a new legal argument, saying that a neutral country is prone to trigger liability problems because of passing laws prohibiting the shipment of arms to belligerent countries, because belligerent countries, after discovering that merchants of the neutral country have violated this law, will inevitably protest against it, or even wage war against it under the pretext of violating the treaty. On the contrary, if the neutral country acts in accordance with international law and does not prohibit the export of arms, then the belligerent countries, even if they issue a "contraband" list, cannot criticize it as a violation of neutrality. The slogan commonly used by the opposition is that the Pittman bill will plunge the United States into the whirlpool of war. In fact, after further research, it must be known that this statement is difficult to establish. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

### Christianity in China: The Spirit is Now Understood by the Masses

(Havas News Agency Air Mail from New York) The Executive Committee of the North American Foreign Mission Conference has recently announced that the preaching of Christianity in China for the past two years has not been hindered by the war, but rather stimulated by it. This proves that the experience of the past two years shows that Christianity is a source of strength, vitality, and hope during wartime and is also necessary. Although the daily lives and minds of the Chinese people have suffered various hardships, their spiritual life has continued to grow. Churches everywhere are crowded, and Christian groups in schools are increasing and are full of vigor. The sales of the Bible are so great that the supply cannot meet the demand. In short, the spirit of service of the Christian church has been understood and recognized by the Chinese masses.

### The Japanese Army's Difficult Battles in Chao-Shan: Japanese Troops on the Chao Coast Still Besieged; Japanese Warships Still Fail to Invade Shantouwei

Shantou Correspondence: A certain division of the Chinese army stationed in Jieyang moved to the Sangpu Mountains in early September, controlling the central area of Chao'an, Chenghai, and Jieyang counties. From a commanding position, they adopted a proactive offensive posture. On the evening of September 11, after the Chinese Zhenzhong Brigade conquered Anbu and besieged Shantou, the division cooperated with the local security forces and guerrillas to control the outskirts of Chaozhou. In the past ten days, they have twice attacked Chaozhou city, annihilating many Japanese soldiers. On the 12th, Chaozhou city was still surrounded by the Chinese army, with the vanguard only one mile from the city walls. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, the Chinese army's forward headquarters encountered more than 200 Japanese infantry and cavalry at the northern foot of Hulu Mountain, engaging in a battle until sunset. The Japanese army was still defeated and retreated towards Yixi Station. The An-Jie Road battlefield in Fengxi and Yunbudi had repeatedly defeated Japanese cavalry and artillery. On the 12th, some traitors led a Japanese army unit of 40 to 50 men in civilian clothes to reconnoiter the Chinese army's position. They were discovered by Chinese sentries, and both sides engaged in battle. The Chinese army killed more than 20 Japanese soldiers. However, the Japanese army repeatedly tried to break through the encirclement line of Chaozhou city and turned to invade Jieyang, also dispatching several thousand reinforcements from Qiongzhou, Weizhou Island, Nanpeng Island, and Nan'ao, but their morale was low and they had no fighting spirit. These reinforcements advanced towards the front of the Chao-Shan Railway on the 13th. Anbu, Caitang, Fuyang, and other stations, which had been recovered by the Chinese army, upon learning of the large Japanese force, the Chinese army retreated in advance to villages in the Sangpu Mountains to observe the Japanese army's strength. The Japanese army, thinking that the Chinese army was afraid to fight, recklessly attacked Sangpu Mountain, Hailian Mountain, and Shaxi, engaging in fierce battles with the Qiu and Gui battalions of the Chinese security forces. By 3:00 PM, they abandoned more than 30 bodies and retreated in defeat. The Chinese army seized five rifles and one machine gun. The Chinese Hua Zhenzhong Brigade learned that the newly added Japanese army numbered only 400 men. That evening, they once again launched a military encirclement of Anbu and attacked Fuyang and Gezhou. On the 14th, Japanese strongholds in Chao'an and Shantou were closely besieged by the Chinese army, and the encirclement became tighter and tighter. Units of the ××× Group stationed in Fengshun, Wuhua, and Meixian also joined the fighting near Chao'an, assigning a strong brigade to encircle every stronghold at Zhuhao Mountain, Jinshan, Hulu Mountain, Bijia Mountain, and Jianghugong, cutting off their communication. The local militia and guerrillas stood on the outer lines, resolutely cutting off Japanese army's water and land transportation. Several Japanese army units have been trapped for many days without supplies, so the Japanese army in Chao-Shan is currently in a difficult battle. Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 13th, the Japanese army sent five warships and eight aircraft to cover 400 Japanese soldiers in a forced landing at Shantouwei. The Chinese army on the shore ambushed and engaged in battle. By 2:00 AM on the 14th, the Japanese army was still defeated and returned to the warships. At noon on the 14th, they sent warships to harass Chenghai and Chaoyang, attempting to disperse the Chinese forces in order to relieve the Japanese army's strongholds, but when the rubber boats approached the shore, they were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army and civilians, and they ultimately failed. Therefore, the dire situation of the Japanese army in Chao-Shan is becoming increasingly apparent.

### The Japanese Army in Jiangyin: Seducing People to Return; Deadline of One Month to Return or Homes Will Be Confiscated

Jiangyin Correspondence: Before the war, Cheng County had a population of more than 5,000 households, totaling more than 25,000 men, women, and children. Since the Japanese army occupied it, residents have fled to other places or moved to rural villages. Although a small number have returned in nearly two years, according to recent surveys, the population of Dongnei is only 2,717, Nannei 1,192, Xinei 1,775, and Beinei 3,281. Homes that were destroyed have not been able to be rebuilt. Last month, the head of the Japanese garrison, Miyake Diaoxi, was replaced by Shiseino. Seeing the desolation in the city and the residents of the city and suburbs avoiding returning, he ordered the head of the Japanese special service team, Hata, to issue many printed materials, threatening the people to return. The language was extremely exaggerated, full of lies. The original text roughly stated that since the military situation in the county has been stabilized, local order has long been restored, and the market is also progressing daily. However, it has been found that while some have gradually returned from their refuge in other places due to the incidents, there are still many who have delayed returning. Now, regarding the population of a corner of the city and suburbs, based on the current Baojia system, the total number is far different from the original number. Empty houses and closed doors are often seen, without a single person. If this continues, what will become of things? Now, with the permission of the garrison, we are instructed to earnestly advise you, otherwise, we will decide to dispose of the houses, even the foundations, and move them for other construction. All people who have taken refuge elsewhere must be informed that each of you has a family fortune, why bother to give it up voluntarily? After this advice, all those who have taken refuge elsewhere must return as soon as possible within one month. If you delay intentionally, once the houses are disposed of, there will be no regrets, etc. However, despite such threats from the Japanese, middle- and upper-class people have not returned at all, treating it with indifference, which shows that the Japanese army finds this desolate city extremely boring.

### The Miserable Living Conditions of Residents Inside Wuxi City: Puppet Government Orders County Resident Certificates; Fuel Shortage and Market Chaos

Wuxi Correspondence: The puppet county government of Xiyi, following the wishes of the Japanese, in order to prevent Chinese patriots from entering the city, stipulated that from the 1st, all residents in the city would be issued county resident certificates. The procedures for issuing them are quite cumbersome, requiring certification from the puppet Baojia heads. Those with county resident certificates do not need to obtain travel permits when traveling outside. Therefore, the residents of Wuxi are increasingly suffering. Recently, there has been an unusual shortage of fuel in the city. Because farmers bringing firewood to the city are generally stopped by Chinese mobile teams, the price of rice straw is only eight catties per yuan. The lives of the residents are miserable. The market has been extremely chaotic since the shortage of copper coins and fractional currency. There are tens of thousands of bamboo tokens used as fractional currency. However, recently, there has also been an unusual shortage of one-yuan legal tender and one- or two-jiao notes. For example, exchanging five yuan of legal tender for one yuan is impossible, and exchanging one yuan of legal tender for one- or two-jiao notes is also a fantasy. Merchants have insufficient capital turnover. The reason for the shortage is that someone is manipulating it in secret.

Most of the pigs come from Jiangbei, and a small number are raised by local farmers. Recently, the number of pigs arriving has suddenly decreased, with only about 20 pigs arriving each day, leading to an excess of demand over supply. The price of raw pigs has risen from 48 yuan per dan to 50 yuan to 53 or 54 yuan, and the price of meat is extremely high, requiring six or seven jiao per catty. The Meat Industry Association is trying to find ways to dredge the source, but it is still subject to various obstacles, and the taxes are heavy. It is feared that the desire to reduce pig prices cannot be achieved.

### The Japanese Army is Powerless to Guard Key Waterway Points in Jiangzhe: Now Under the Control of the Chinese Army

Suzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army decided to invade northern Hunan. Prior to this, they transferred a large number of Japanese troops from here, causing the Japanese army's defense zone in the suburbs of Suzhou to become increasingly weak. Although the Japanese army used puppet troops as substitutes, they still felt that the staffing was insufficient, so they had to withdraw the garrison troops from the waterways and organize a mobile-style troop to demonstrate in various places every day, putting on a false show of strength. The Chinese army near Suzhou, aware of their plan, took advantage of their weakness and attacked the Japanese army in Luxu (Wujiang County) on the 25th of last month, cutting off their water communication line, making it impossible for the Japanese army to run rampant on the water, and thereby controlling the Suzhou-Zhejiang waterways. Important strongholds such as Jinze, Shengze, Shuangta, Zhouzhuang, Luxu, and Xinta are now all in the hands of the Chinese army. Currently, the Japanese army is afraid that the Chinese army will take advantage of the situation to attack, so they have deployed defenses in the vicinity of this county and transferred a large number of puppet troops to reinforce defenses in Chenmu, Jiaozhi (Wuxian County), Beiguan, and Pingwang (Wujiang County). However, it is heard that the Chinese army's current activities are aimed at controlling the Japanese army's defense zone, so they will not launch a counterattack on any area for the time being. They will wait until the arrangements are in place before launching a large-scale suppression of the Japanese army.

### Trends in Teacher Education in Various Countries (7): Soviet Russia's Pragmatism

Since the Communist Party took power in Soviet Russia, it has reversed its old views and seems to have a retaliatory effect on education. Therefore, restrictions are made without sparing effort. Let us first take its universities as an example. Universities under the control of the Soviet government aim to cultivate specialized experts required by the state. The curriculum of each school is formulated by central officials, and Marx's theory is used as a dogma to consistently teach students in order to train them. As for university professors, they must pass a test of their teachings beforehand before they can take office. If there are any reactionary remarks, they will be warned, tried, or even dismissed. The Soviet government treats university professors like this, so one can imagine how it treats primary and secondary school teachers. However, in terms of the active training of primary and secondary school teachers, it can be said that they believe that teachers in communist countries should be pioneers of labor culture, understand communist theory, and have either agricultural or industrial skills. They should be able to hold an axe and use a saw, and be workers of reality. In addition, since they are education workers, joining the labor union and constituting a factor in the Soviet state mechanism, sharing weal and woe with the whole, is of course a necessary condition. In 1931, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decided that all teachers should learn about factory production, Soviet agriculture, collective farm law, handicraft industry law, and the basic knowledge and skills of various machine shops. Of course, this is not enough to be competent. The object of education is children and teenagers. In order to make their nature and environment compatible, they have to devote themselves to hard work education. Therefore, anatomy of students' physiology and biology, as well as child psychology and psychology, are all essential knowledge. In order to fundamentally understand their national system, sociology, especially Marx's philosophical dialectical materialism, should be particularly clear. As for the training of teachers, there are two main places. First, in the last two years of the nine-year secondary school, they are given the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in teaching positions, so that they can be kindergarten, first-level school, and primary political education school teachers. This can be said to focus relatively on ordinary knowledge and skills. The second is educational technical schools, located above seven-year primary schools, and for ten-year schools, they tend to industry or agriculture according to the needs of their locality. There is no other need to compare Japanese and Soviet teacher education. The only special feature is the desire to use a fixed ideal school type to mold their teachers and further mold their people to achieve the same effect by different routes. (End of the full text)

### Anti-British Movement in Peiping: Two Church Schools Closed

(Reuters Telegram from Peiping, 6th) The anti-British movement in Peiping has caused two British church schools to close. A Chinese newspaper in this city stated that these schools have closed because the anti-British movement has caused most students to transfer to other schools. The anti-British church movement in various parts of North China has caused almost all British churches in Hebei, Shanxi, and northern Henan to close.

### Measures to Restrict Re-enrollment of Suspended Students in Fujian: Education Department Orders All Middle Schools to Comply

(Fuzhou News) The Fujian Education Department has formulated measures to restrict the re-enrollment of suspended students in middle schools and instructed all middle schools in the province to comply. The notification states that students in middle schools or normal schools may request suspension for one semester or one academic year due to special circumstances of their bodies or families. This has been clearly stipulated in the revised middle school regulations and the revised normal school regulations. However, since we are currently in a period of resistance against Japan, some suspended students in various schools have been unable to return to school on time due to transportation blockades. This should be slightly changed to make it possible to remedy the situation. Now, special restrictions are formulated in accordance with the regulations and in consideration of the actual situation as follows: (1) The period of suspension requested by students should, as stipulated, be a maximum of one academic year in principle, but if a student is still unable to return to school after the suspension period due to special circumstances, he or she may continue to request suspension for one semester or one academic year. (2) When students who request continued suspension request re-enrollment, they must be subject to a grade placement test, and only after passing the test can they be re-enrolled. (3) Students who do not request continued suspension after the suspension period expires, or who do not re-enroll after the continued suspension period expires, should not be allowed to re-enroll thereafter. (4) Suspension and re-enrollment in vocational schools should be handled in accordance with the preceding regulations. In addition to separate orders, these orders are issued to be followed.

### Finance Quiet Foreign Exchange Market
Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in exchange rates or listings. The British exchange in the gray market was exceptionally dull. China's finances have seen repeated new achievements recently, and the financial situation is quite solid. Operators, to avoid failure, have gradually abandoned the means of manipulating the market. Therefore, the impact on the foreign exchange market is only the supply and demand of actual use. However, initially, because Chinese merchants had a slight appetite for buying, and British banks were also active in tracking advantageous opportunities, the morning situation was slightly soft. In the afternoon, due to a cable from Hong Kong and Sassoon's selling, the market once returned to equilibrium. Finally, because HSBC and other banks had good purchasing interest, the result was still slightly soft. British gold was quoted at 4/6/875, and the US dollar closed at 7.50. Because there were fewer arbitrageurs this month, it was slightly closer to the spot price. It was heard that a certain Chinese bank had offered US dollars for November delivery. The entire day's trading was very quiet.

Beneficial Chinese Merchants Still Engaging in Settlements
In the early morning, the London large bill and Bank of America prices were flat. London gold remained stable. Exchange rates for the British pound against the US dollar and the French franc were flat. The exchange rate against Shanghai was 25. The US dollar against the British pound shrank by 1.5 points. The exchange rate against Shanghai did not change. The exchange rate against the French franc was 875. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 4/6/5 for British gold and 7.53125 for US dollars. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was flat and the US dollar was tighter by 03125, due to the exchange rate shrinkage. After opening, the market was quiet and unchanged. When HSBC's listing was announced, there was no movement. When the silver equalization tax was announced, there was no increase or decrease. After that, because Chinese merchants came to settle, and British banks had a good appetite for accepting, only certain HSBC banks and others were still eager to supply. Therefore, although the situation was tight, it was not dramatic. HSBC sold spot British gold to favorable Chinese merchants at 4/6/5 and 4/6/875, and a certain bank sold spot US dollars to favorable Chinese merchants at 7.53125 and 0.50. It was heard that a certain Chinese bank sold US dollars for November delivery to foreign banks at 7.4375. Subsequently, there were fewer transactions, so the process was even more unchanged. Until the noon close, the bank's spot selling price was 4/6/46875 for British gold and 7.50 for US dollars. Compared to the morning opening, the British pound was slightly tighter by 03125, and the US dollar was also slightly softer by 03125.

Sassoon From Hong Kong Sold
In the afternoon, initially, because the Western merchant Sassoon came to sell, and a telegram from Hong Kong reported sales, successively selling spot British gold at 4/6/5 to HSBC and other banks, and spot US dollars at 7.53125 and 5625. This caused the situation to return to equilibrium once. After entering, because HSBC and others still had a good appetite for accepting, and the selling trend had ceased, the state of the market was soft again. Until the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was 4/6/46875 for British gold and 7.50 for US dollars, 4/6/4375 for British gold for this month, 7.4375 for US dollars for this month, 4/6/40625 for British gold for November, and 7.375 for US dollars for November. As a result, compared to the previous day's spot, the British pound was tighter by 03125, and the US dollar was softer by 0625. This month saw no gains or losses.

The British Pound in New York is Relatively Weak Reuters, New York, 5th. Today, in the New York foreign exchange market, the British pound is relatively weak. According to bankers, this is only a reaction to the recent stabilization of the rising trend. Since the beginning of September, the Bank of England has been unwilling to sell British pounds to the United States, but it is rumored that it now intends to sell them, so as not to make the exchange rate high. The prices of other European currencies vary.

Hong Kong Exchange Market: British Pound Flat, US Dollar Tighter
Hong Kong, 6th. Today's exchange market opened steadily. The British pound was unchanged, and the US dollar spot was tighter by 1875, at 75.25. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 5 yuan, to 330 yuan.

### Rumors Subside Gold Prices Firm
Yesterday's cash gold bar gray market situation was colorless all day, with very slight fluctuations. The rumors of recent days have subsided, and foreign exchange fluctuations on the day were quite narrow. People's minds were not enough to influence, and buying and selling were not as prosperous as before. The situation turned from weak to firm. The morning opening immediately retreated to 4,050 yuan. Subsequently, because securities firms slightly sold, followed by slow sales, such as scalp trades, there were absolutely no large inflows or outflows. Meanwhile, a certain gold firm took the opportunity to absorb. However, it once fell to a low of 4,040 yuan. Because foreign exchange was soft and Hong Kong firms had a slight appetite for purchasing, the result rebounded to a high of 4,060 yuan. The closing price was 5 yuan higher than yesterday. The ups and downs were ordinary, very suitable for the tastes of general smaller speculators. The entire day's trading was only 700-800 taels, which has indeed returned to the narrow market when gold prices had not soared. Silver shop jewelry gold was unchanged all day, and customs gold was also stable.

Gold Bar Rose 5 Yuan
Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened flat and weak. Initially, twenty taels were sold by money changers to silver shop firms at a price of 4,050 yuan, which was 5 yuan lower than the previous close. After opening, cash gold shops sold thirty taels to money changers, and the price continued to be lowered by 5 yuan, to 4,045 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold firm and money changers raised the price, and it immediately returned to 5 yuan higher. A certain gold firm bought twenty taels from securities firms at a price of 4,050 yuan. Later, because securities firms still had supply intentions, combined with sales from cash gold shops, it fell by another 10 yuan. Cash gold shops sold ten taels to gold firms at a price of 4,040 yuan. After that, it was suddenly heard that foreign exchange was soft, triggering buying interest. For a time, sellers were waiting and watching, and the price jumped 10 yuan. Money changers bought ten taels from silver shop firms at a price of 4,050 yuan. Later, because a certain money changer continued to absorb, and a certain gold firm also had a purchasing appetite, it continued to raise the price by 10 yuan. Money changers mutually traded thirty taels at a price of 4,060 yuan. Near noon, it slightly weakened again. A certain gold firm sold twenty taels back to money changers at 4,055 yuan, as the noon closing price. In the early afternoon, it opened weakly and fell by 5 yuan. Silver shop firms bought twenty taels from money changers at a price of 4,050 yuan. Although foreign exchange slightly turned tight and firm afterwards, a certain money changer had a good appetite for absorbing, so the market reversed and rose. A total of 100 taels were purchased from peers and trading firms at prices of 4,055 yuan and 4,058 yuan. After entering, it was heard that foreign exchange was slightly soft again, so it continued to raise by 2 yuan. Gold firms bought twenty taels from money changers at a price of 4,060 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it rose 5 yuan compared to the previous day. The entire day had only 20 yuan of ups and downs. The cash gold shops' own-brand gold was sold at 10 yuan higher than the gold bar price, and purchases had to be reduced by about 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Unchanged
Silver shop jewelry gold was exchanged per tael, because the gold bar price fluctuated very slightly, so it did not change all day. Da Tong Hang still hung 410 yuan. New Tong Hang was the same as the above price, and purchases had to be reduced by about 20 yuan.

### British Gold Pound Fell the Most
Yesterday's foreign currency market was calm. The British gold pound fell by 1.50 yuan, which was the largest drop. The US gold pound also fell by 1 yuan. Philippine notes rose by 0.05 yuan. Japanese gold notes once rose to 1.40 yuan, but eventually retreated to 1.38 yuan. As a result, it still fell by 5%. Korean notes also rose to 1.205 yuan, but ended at 1.19 yuan, still up by 2%. The rest remained unchanged.

### Discount and Call Loan Rates All Fixed
Yesterday's discount rate for foreign exchange drafts and bills remained at around 70 yuan per thousand yuan, unchanged. The call loan rate of the Money Industry Association remained at 0.19 yuan. The morning and afternoon markets were the same.

### Indian Silver Falls Again British and American Prices Return to Flat
London, 5th. In the silver market, speculators came and went, and the market was flat. The market was flat after closing, and there were no large transactions. Large bars of silver, both near and far term, were weak. New York Silver: The US spot price was unchanged. Mumbai Silver: The Indian silver market continued to be sluggish. The current and future terms continued to fall sharply by 1 rupee "Anna." The transaction list totaled 60 sheets.

### Securities Active Buyers Domestic Bonds Thriving Foreign Stock Transactions Also Very Prosperous
Yesterday's securities gray market situation showed an increasingly strong trend. Market prices slowly rose without a reversal. People's minds were optimistic and gradually becoming consistent. Since the victory in the Xiangbei battle, its success far exceeded the Battle of Taierzhuang. Morale was extremely encouraged, which had a significant impact. In addition, the visit of the envoy from the invading country to Chongqing was generally considered to be related to the financial aspect. Therefore, buyers were even more active, and they consistently absorbed with the intention of making profits. In addition to covering short positions, they may have turned long. Hongda Liaoyi and others also had considerable absorption. On the selling side, except for Tong Kang Yong Kang Mao Tai and other firms, the rest were scattered retail investors taking profits. Class A has broken through 54 yuan, and Class B has also broken through the 47 yuan mark. The trend should still be a curved upward trend. The market price as a result, continued to rise 0.50 to 0.85 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated to be 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading: fifty shares of the Cotton Yarn Exchange were traded at a price of 39.75 yuan. Suddenly, it rose by another 1 yuan.

In addition, the Public Works Association reported that yesterday's stock market could be called a big boom day. The volume of transactions in the banking stock sector was rare in the institute. Prices were exceptionally beautiful. Shanghai Silver Company, Yangzi Silver Company, International Trust Company and Jardine Matheson and other stocks rose the most. Other stocks, although not advancing rapidly, were at least able to maintain their original position. Rubber stocks were also more active, and prices slightly improved. But comparing the entire market, it can only be regarded as a background in the painting and still lacks special prominence.

London, 5th. Today's London Stock Exchange listing of British companies' stocks saw a slight increase. HSBC Bank Hong Kong registered shares rose by 1 pound, to 73 pounds. Gula Kirk Rubber shares rebounded by 9 pence, to 16 shillings and 3 pence. The rest remained unchanged. London, 5th. Today, China's foreign debt, still opened with four types of currencies: French, American, etc. The listing market was stable and unchanged.

### Yarn and Cloth Cotton Yarn Merchants Inactive in Procurement Prices Slow and Not Declining
The yarn market's performance declined, because demand was sluggish. In South China, affected by controlled exchange rates, the merchants were unable to procure. Therefore, transactions were greatly reduced. The general float was large, and due to the poor environment, the thought of unloading spontaneously arose. The chips on the market became more relaxed, and the market was inclined to fall. However, the general well-funded people came to search, maintain, and hoard when prices fell, so the decline was still slow. Judging from the market situation, it will certainly not escape the weak situation. It is difficult to have new posture discovery unless actual needs improve. It has currently fallen to 120 yuan lower than its peak.

The current yarn opened in the morning. Peers gathered together, everyone folded their hands and did not move. It was delayed until 9:50 before the market opened. There were many sellers on the market, and the opening price fell by 10 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse was 740 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 725 yuan. During the middle, it slightly fell by another three or four yuan, but customer sales were still sluggish. Until the close, a portion was slightly dragged in, and it rebounded by four or five yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 855 bales were traded. On the 7th, 10 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and 55 pieces were shipped to foreign countries. The market price for 20-count Double Horse fell by 11 yuan, Tiannu fell by 8 yuan, and Double Globe fell by 7 yuan. The amount of purchases by each merchant is listed on the left.

### Active Local Cotton Trading
Local cotton trading saw another improvement. Yong'an Factory purchased a large amount of white-packaged Hua cotton, estimated at 4,000-5,000 bales, and prices were stable. Other manufacturers have not developed. As for the trading among peers, it was also more active than the previous day. Although the source from northern Jiangsu has not been cut off, transportation along the way is very difficult. Today, there were 1,372 bales of Nantong cotton at the pier. It was heard that the quality of the goods was inferior, and the price was 3-4 yuan cheaper. Goods with bright silk, fine hair, and fine fiber were still reluctant to loosen. 1,040 bales of Changyinsha cotton arrived. On the 7th, 295 pieces of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong. The current cotton selling prices are listed on the left.

Nantong Cotton 157.00 Yong'an Factory Purchased 3,500 Bales Payment Sent to Factory
Changyinsha 162.00 Also Also 1,000 Bales Also Also
Nantong Cotton 149.00 Peer Purchase 200 Bales Also Warehouse Delivery

North Taicang 151.00 Peer Purchase 100 Bales Also Warehouse Delivery
Also Also 152.00 Also Also 100 Bales Also Also

Another message: Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai Port has been very sluggish recently. All parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude, so the market is unusually quiet. Factories have slightly purchased American cotton orders, but the amount is not large. Japanese factories have also purchased Indian cotton, all of which are immediate loading orders. This batch of Indian cotton can be transported by the middle of next month.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market initially saw cotton prices slightly rise by several pounds due to peer purchases. Later, due to the strong selling of the southern set and the selling of the New Orleans silk merchants on the market, the market turned weak. As a result, the market was very uneven, with rises of 1 pound and falls of 2-3 pounds. Indian Cotton Market: Recently, due to the strengthening of the British and American exchange rates and the relatively stable European political situation, cotton prices have fallen. Yesterday, it fell another 3 rupees. Egyptian rose 10 pounds yesterday and Liverpool fell 1 penny.

### Grain New Rice Arrivals Surge Selling Prices Continue to Fall
The decline of Japonica rice continued to be fierce, and people's minds were already vacant. In addition to the transportation problems in Changzhou, Wuxi, Songjiang, and other areas, the new goods from various places could be freely transported. Yesterday, it was estimated that 5,000-6,000 bags of goods from Suzhou, Jiaxing, and other places were transported by train, and 3-4 ships of goods arrived from He Xia. There were few local merchants who came to do business, so the merchants frantically sold again to find a way out. However, the result was ultimately ineffective. The total transaction volume was only 4,000-5,000 bags, and the prices of the goods fell by as much as 1-2 yuan to 4-5 yuan. Although the various grades of Japonica rice showed higher prices and final resolutions, the new milled Zhente goods were still expensive because they were not much in the market and it was difficult for buyers to obtain them. However, the middle grades and Suzhou, Tongzhou, Kunshan, and other grades only opened at 35.5 yuan to 35 yuan, a depreciation of about 2 yuan. New Japonica rice was 31.3 yuan. Fengjing Baige initially opened at 30 yuan and closed at 28.9 yuan. Its price drop was the most drastic, reaching 3-4-5 yuan. Songjiang Bo Po, due to lack of goods for a long time, opened at 34-5 yuan. Yangjian Gao was 34 yuan, and the final price was 33 yuan, a depreciation of 2 yuan. Luzhi, however, had fewer arrivals and was quite popular with stores. According to the market, it could have held its ground, but was constrained by other goods, so it also went down 1 yuan. The special opened at 36 yuan, the middle grade at 35.5 yuan to 35 yuan. The customer sharp price was the cheapest. If Jiangbei New Sharp only opened at 30 yuan and 2 jiao, the next opened at 29 yuan and 6-7 jiao. Wuhu Gao pointed at 30 yuan and 05 jiao, and the final price was 29.5 yuan. The sharp was 28-9 yuan, and the yuan was also 1 yuan. Old was 32-3 yuan, and new goods were 30 yuan and 05 jiao to 30 yuan.

Another message: The performance of customer indica rice fell, down a small 1.3 to 1.4 yuan from the previous market. According to the current low price of customer indica rice, the market could have stabilized. The daily sales volume was also more prosperous than japonica rice. However, the new drops have been terrible for days, totaling as much as 10 yuan. Moreover, Japanese merchants secretly sold, and the Jiangbei, Beijing, and Wuhu sources have 3,000-5,000 bags every day, so the market is difficult to support. Yesterday, the highest price of machine-indica rice was only 29 yuan and 057 jiao, and the final price was 29 yuan. Rice was only 28 yuan and 35 jiao, and brown rice was 27-8 yuan.

### Flour Market Difficult to Save Declining Trend Wheat Arrivals Sparse Sales Sluggish
Flour: Yesterday's spot trading was bland, because the No. 2 flour factory still kept the original price of 7 yuan, unwilling to compete with the low-priced recycled goods. Therefore, factory flour lacked a large number of transactions early on. Recently, local merchants' actual sales have been paying attention to purchasing warehouse receipt goods. Yesterday, Lao Che brand opened at 6.756 yuan, and Bingchuan brand was only sold at 6.7 yuan. The Phoenix brand flour of the Japanese factory was only sold at 6.45 yuan. The selling atmosphere was full in the morning, and its declining trend was difficult to save for a time. The total transaction volume was estimated to be 30,000-40,000 bags. It was heard that in the later market, the customer hoarding side was still trying to hold on because the factory price was not low, so the market felt slightly stable. Today, 9,500 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.

Wheat: Yesterday's trading continued to lack progress. Arrivals were not surging. Holders believed that the European war situation was difficult to be peaceful, and the source of foreign wheat was ultimately difficult to divide. Most of them were waiting on the market for a good price. Chinese and Japanese factories made slight purchases, and hoarders also inquired slightly. As a result, the market was still the same as the previous market. The total market sold 3,500 bags of wheat from Guandian, Suzhou, Wuxi, Kunshan, Danyang, and Yangzhou. Except for 2,000 bags purchased by Fu Fu two factories, the rest were purchased by Chemical Industry Society and others.

### Miscellaneous Grains Sesame Sales Active Yellow Beans Raised and Reduced
Recently, the miscellaneous grain market has been largely the same, and the market has not changed much. Sesame Guangdong merchants' sales are active, and the current source is still only small tickets, so the market has recovered a lot, and the overall situation continues to be firm. Yesterday, in addition to purchasing 12 bags of Wuhu white sesame in this street (price details in the market price column), Guangdong merchants purchased 100 bags of Danyang white sesame and 200 bags of Hankou sesame. Yellow beans are not taken for export sales in high markets, resulting in a trend of high lows and killing low prices. Yesterday, the market opened 400 bags of Taicang beans, priced from 13.1 yuan to 12.8 yuan, and 75 bags of Jiangbei beans, priced at 14.5 yuan. Today, 460 bags of beans and 250 bags of sesame are shipped to Hong Kong. Another 2,000 pieces of bean cake were shipped to foreign countries.

### Sugar Market Sugar Prices Mediocre
Yesterday's sugar market was stable. The association's planned delivery spot was slightly smaller than 55 yuan for 24 coarse white local warehouses. Foreign warehouse goods were initially 54.8 yuan, and later returned to 55 yuan. There was no change in transshipment goods. Taikoo sugar was also initially flat and then tight. East Warehouse B mark was 58.8 yuan to 59.2 jiao, West Warehouse 50 to 9 yuan to 59.5 jiao. The rest of the CW marks and others were returned according to the rules. H mark cart was 43 yuan to 43.2 jiao. The prices of local cotton white and No. 1 ice remained unchanged. The prices of national sugars were slightly looser and still lacked bulk transactions. The goods from the Xinghua store will be opened soon, and the market trend looks soft.

### North and South Goods New South Water Lily Seeds
Southern Pond Water Lily Seeds: The first batch of scattered goods has arrived in Shanghai. Since the goods have been out of stock for a long time, it feels very light. This street sold more than 200 yuan. The old goods of the pond lily seeds are still sold at the original price, and the market is firm.

### Silk and Tea Zhen Mei Green Tea Foreign Firms Actively Purchasing
Yesterday's green tea market continued to be active. The Zhenmei's outgoing route was exceptionally sharp and agile. The pearl tea was also scarce. The Zhenmei of excellent quality was enthusiastically purchased by Tongfu Baolong Yihua Xiehe and other companies. The market price was firm and rose by 12-3 yuan. A total of more than 1,800 boxes of various green teas were traded in the city. The market was stable except for the Zhenmei which saw a rise. The various foreign firms are packing and loading the goods they have purchased. It is heard that a total of more than 8,000 boxes will be loaded next week.

Today, 130 pieces of tea leaves are shipped to Hong Kong, and 50 pieces are shipped to the west.

### Coal Cooked Coal Rose and Then Fell
The price of cooked coal rose to 80 yuan per ton with coal balls at the end of the previous month. However, due to the easing of coal balls, the cooked coal business was hit hard. It also fell sharply, cutting 6 yuan. Small cooked coal costs 54 yuan per ton, 3.7 yuan per load, or 100 market pounds. Regular customers do not take delivery. As for the selected large pieces, add them according to the price.

### Hardware Freight Expensive Copper Prices Rose Slightly
Hardware transactions were quiet because prices were high and everyone was afraid to purchase them. The market was silent. However, people's minds were still firm due to the lack of overseas sources. Among them, copper products were produced in the United States and Japan, which are not affected by the European war, so the source has not been cut off, and there are many stocks. However, the freight along the way is expensive, so the market price in Shanghai also increased. Yesterday, TC purple copper blocks were sold at 250 yuan per load, purple copper skins from No. 12 to No. 22 were sold at 260 yuan per load, No. 16 purple copper wire was sold at 260 yuan per unit, and yellow copper strips from 4 points to 1 inch were sold at 230 yuan per load. It is said that No. 12 to No. 20 yellow copper skins were sold at 230 yuan per unit.

### Piece Goods The Demand for Woolen Cloth Retail Stores Has Increased Significantly
Woolen fabrics have been in great demand recently due to the cool autumn weather, active retail sales of Chinese clothing fabrics, western suits, men's and women's coats, shoes, hats, and accessories. The retail market has been very prosperous and the demand is very hot. Sample shops from the dismantling firms are now selling 2,000 yuan or more of spot transactions every day. Clean water shops in the Qipan Street area are now selling more than 1,500 to 1,600 yuan, and less than 500 to 600 yuan.

### The Shanghai West Incident: A Possible Solution Emerges, Municipal Council Attempts to Remove Obstacles, Continued Negotiations Are Only a Matter of Time

The issue of roads built beyond the Settlement boundaries and the actions of the Japanese and puppet regime fluctuate in intensity. Yesterday, the situation appeared to ease somewhat. The area from Jing'an Temple along Haig Road to Xujiahui, representing the far western boundary of Shanghai West, saw no changes in the immediate situation. However, the far eastern boundary of Shanghai West, around Jiaozhou Road to Connaught Road (Yanping Road), has experienced a series of gangster robberies, leading to a sudden increase in tension. Police searches have shifted from west to east. Throughout the day, a large number of detectives are stationed at key locations, checking pedestrians and vehicles. Six detectives are transported in each vehicle, and two armored cars patrol the area, maintaining strict vigilance. In the Caojiadu (commonly known as Wujiaochang) area, trucks of Japanese military police and puppet police are frequently seen. Armed puppet police patrol in formation. The police patrol teams continue their normal duties, merely exchanging glances when encountering each other on the road. At the guard posts on Great Western Road (Yih Ding Pan Road), Tunsin Road and Columbia Road, Chinese constables have been replaced by Indian constables, maintaining a standoff with the puppet police. Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, met with reporters yesterday morning, stating that the Municipal Council is seeking a solution to the incident with the utmost tolerance, and that continued negotiations are only a matter of time. He also noted that police force in Shanghai West has increased compared to previous years. Details are listed below:

Continued Negotiations Will Certainly Take Place

The English "China Press" reports that Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, stated to reporters this morning (the 6th) that the Municipal Council will not automatically concede its rights over roads outside the Settlement. The Municipal Council is constantly striving for patience to avoid any unexpected incidents that may disrupt the situation. This is quite obvious. Mr. Fessenden once again denied that he had held any meetings or negotiations with the "Grand Avenue" authorities after meeting with "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an in the city center a month ago. However, he stated that negotiations would take place sooner or later.

Police Strength in Shanghai West Is Not Weakened

At that time, both sides will have some "give and take" on this matter. The current situation is not what the Municipal Council desires, so the Council is currently trying to remove obstacles. Mr. Fessenden explained the police activities of the Public Concession in the roads outside the Settlement, saying, "Many people believe that the number of constables on the roads outside the Settlement has decreased. The truth is quite the opposite. The police force in these areas is now twice as large as it was before the war in 1937, and the police force in these areas has greatly increased since March 1st."

Negotiations Were Held Before the Shanghai War

The "Continental Times" reports that government officials told reporters yesterday (the 5th) that the Municipal Council will certainly attempt to resolve the various issues concerning the roads outside the Shanghai West Settlement. In 1937, the Municipal Council and Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun were about to reach a resolution on various issues in the area, but it was interrupted by the war. However, the current "Municipal Government" does not accept the previous plan, as it stipulates that the Municipal Council should collect taxes from residences and shops on the roads bordering the Settlement.

Someone Is Behind All Actions

Although formal negotiations are currently suspended, on the surface, Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, is consulting with "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an. However, behind Mr. Fessenden, there are other officials seriously considering all aspects of the current situation. And behind "Mayor" Fu, there are also other officials, mostly Japanese "advisors" and soldiers, who present their opinions and demands to the Municipal Council through the "Mayor". Under the instructions of the Japanese, the "Municipal Government's" method of solving the problem is to dispatch ineffective police forces to the roads outside the Settlement.

Temporary Tolerance to Seek a Solution

However, the Municipal Council has not taken such infringing actions. The Municipal Council will certainly not concede its rights in the area, but currently it is determined to tolerate such infringing actions. Even if the Concession police and the "Grand Avenue" police give conflicting traffic signals at the same location, causing disorder, it is now temporarily tolerated. Given the current situation, the Municipal Council can only continue to act to the best of its ability and make every effort to find a solution in the shortest possible time.

Western School Not Occupied

The Municipal Council's Western School on Yuyuan Road was invaded by puppet police on the 3rd, causing great panic among the families of the students. When reporters asked Mr. Fessenden, Director-General and Director-General of the Municipal Council, about this the day before yesterday, he said that he was paying close attention to this matter. However, yesterday, Mr. Hailey, the director of the Education Department of the Municipal Council, told reporters that the puppet police did not invade the Municipal Council's Western Girls' School on Yuyuan Road, nor did they invade any other Municipal Council schools.

### Puppet Police Mistakenly Arrest a British Man, Apology Averts Further Action

British national Walter J. Ward, a well-known athlete working for Reuters, was forcibly taken from his residence at No. 23, Lane 1984, Jing'an Temple Road by puppet police in Shanghai West at around 9:00 p.m. on the 5th, and taken to Great Western Road. His prepared wireless telegraph machine was also taken away. All the details have already been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Later, it was learned that after the police received the report of this case, Mr. Dick and Mr. Samson rushed to the location and to the Japanese Military Police Department and made serious representations. Major Asher led a team of British soldiers and accompanied Acting Superintendent Smith to meet with a Japanese major. The Japanese side then stated that it was a mistaken arrest, and released Mr. Ward at 0:15 a.m. yesterday (the 6th) and returned the seized items. According to yesterday's news, Mr. Ward received an apology from the "Grand Avenue Police" soon after his release.

### Tensions Rise in the Southwest Suburbs of Shanghai, Chinese Troops Await Opportunity at the Border of Qingpu and Songjiang Counties, Large Force Approaches Pinghu with Great Momentum

The situation in the four suburbs of Shanghai has been quite tense for several days. It is reported that guerrilla forces lurking in various counties near the suburbs will take demonstrative actions around the Double Tenth National Day celebration and take the opportunity to attack the Japanese defense zone. Therefore, the Japanese military is engaged in heightened alert. The "Grand Avenue Police" have also been "ordered" by their superiors not to take leave without reason from today, and have assembled in various "departments" to be dispatched at any time. It is said that the Japanese military is most concerned about a part of the southwestern suburbs of the city, because the Chinese troops, whose numbers are unknown, at the border of Qingpu and Songjiang counties may attack the Shanghai city area. Currently, the inspection of civilians entering and leaving various districts in the suburbs is becoming more stringent. No one may forget to carry a "Citizen's Pass," which is like a talisman, otherwise they will encounter unimaginable danger.

Gunfire in Shanghai West

Residents in Shanghai West heard clear machine gun fire late the night before last. Residents in the western district of the French Concession also heard gunfire at around 3:00 a.m. yesterday. Where did this gunfire come from in the middle of the night? It is worth investigating. According to local villagers in Shanghai West, recently regular Chinese troops have moved to the section of the Shanghai-Suzhou Railway along the line. The Japanese troops stationed along the railway have been on high alert recently. This gunfire seems to have been fired by the Japanese military as a demonstration.

Closure of Zha Port

Zha Port, Luhui and Jinhuiqiao towns on the border between Punan and Fengxian were attacked by Japanese military harassment a day ago, according to a Reuters report from this port on the 6th. According to sources at the British Consulate, regarding the arrest and detention of Reuters employee Walter by the Grand Avenue Police at his residence at No. 23, Lane 1948, Jing'an Temple Road last night, two officials from the Shanghai "Special City Government" apologized to British Consul General Phillips this afternoon. British Consul Kitson received them on behalf of the Consul General. The two officials were Lu Ying, Director of the Police Bureau of the Shanghai "Special City Government," and Colonel Igarashi, the chief advisor of the Police Bureau. Lu Ying apologized on behalf of the Shanghai "Special City Government" for the arrest and detention of Walter, and told the British Consul that the Grand Avenue Police entered Walter's residence without knowing that it was the property of a third country, and did not know that he was a British citizen, so they made the arrest. The police responsible for this matter have been punished. Lu Ying also assured the British Consul that such incidents would not happen again, and that they would never interfere with British nationals in the future. Full protection will be given to British residents under the jurisdiction of the Special City Government. They were immediately recovered by the guerrillas. Only Zha Port and Pubei are guarded by Japanese troops, and there are Japanese warships on alert in Puxin. The day before yesterday, a team of Japanese troops explored from Zha Port to the countryside of Luhui and Jinhui, and had a fierce battle with the guerrilla forces of Fan Gen部. The waterway of Zha Port was completely cut off. The Tiancheng Company's ships traveling from Shanghai to Luhui, Xinchang and Jinhui were all blocked outside the port and turned back to Shanghai yesterday morning.

County Magistrate Captured

Water traffic between Shanghai and Pinghu has been difficult to resume because regular Chinese troops are concentrated in the Xindai area, strictly prohibiting the operation of ships named with the character "丸". Ships traveling from Shanghai to Pinghu only reach Zhujing. Above Zhujing, passengers and goods rely on wooden boats. According to news from the shipping industry, a certain county magistrate of Pinghu County was surrounded by a team of Japanese troops in a certain village because he personally investigated the sufferings of the people in disguise, and was betrayed by traitors. The Japanese troops planned to burn down all the houses and people in the village. The county magistrate, regarding death as homecoming, stepped forward, resulting in his capture, but the houses and villagers were preserved. After the Chinese troops learned of this, they dispatched a large force to approach Pinghu County to rescue him.

### Division of Currency Insufficient, Another 500,000 Yuan to Be Printed, Central Bank Has Contacted Wing On Company, Guild of Tobacco and Exchange Trades Advises Against Hoarding for Profit

After the issuance of the division of currency notes by the Central Bank, circulation on the market has still not been widespread. Therefore, the price tickets of various companies such as trams, buses, Sincere, Wing On and The Sun have become the only alternative to cash due to actual demand. It is a question as to when this situation will end. The amount of division currency currently issued by the Central Bank is insufficient to meet the needs of the market. Those who hold division currency are driven by curiosity to hoard it and not use it in the market. If this situation cannot be broken, the complexity and disputes of Shanghai division currency substitutes will be difficult to resolve.

Strictly Prohibit Hoarding

The Shanghai Tobacco and Exchange Trades Guild, in view of the fact that the division of currency notes has not been widely circulated in the market after issuance, specially sent a letter to its members yesterday, advising them to circulate the division of currency notes and recall the price tickets that have been issued. At the same time, it was publicly announced in the market, "This guild is entrusted by the Central Bank to distribute one-cent and five-cent division currency notes, which have been distributed to all member companies. However, the market has not yet seen widespread circulation. Moreover, this division currency is a legal currency of the country. Citizens should exchange it. In addition to the commission that should be collected, there should be no discount. This guild has sent a letter to its members and hopes to quickly circulate this division currency on the market and recall the issued price tickets. If any hoarding is found in the future, we will report it to the authorities for legal sanctions. Don't say that we are being too harsh then."

Gradual Issuance, Contacting for Continued Printing

After the first batch of division currency notes was issued on the 29th of last month, the Tobacco and Exchange Trades Guild was entrusted to distribute them to various markets. The Central Bank directly exchanged them with various banks and silver shops and adopted a gradual issuance system. Various trade guilds and major companies that need division currency for legitimate reasons can apply directly to the bank by letter. The bank will酌情酌量兑给, depending on the actual number required. The first batch of division currency notes has issued more than 300,000 yuan and will soon be completely issued. The second batch has been contacted by the head office with the Wing On Company in Hong Kong for continued printing. Once agreed, a contract will be signed. It is said that the number is still 500,000 yuan.

Citizens' Branch of Guild to Collect Division Currency

The 16th district branch of the Xincheng Road Citizens' Union, in view of the fact that various shops have requested to collect division currency notes on their behalf for circulation, sent a letter to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank yesterday, saying, "To the honored bank, since your bank issued one-cent and five-cent division currency notes, it has been very convenient for industry and commerce. Many member shops of this union now request to collect this division currency on their behalf for circulation. As various shops cannot collect this division currency, there are indeed many difficulties in their business. Therefore, we are writing to inform you that we can collect and distribute it on behalf of the union with funds. We hope that you will investigate and reply."

### European Transport Continues, Silk and Tea Sales Brisk, Foreign Firms Purchase Chinese Silk in Large Quantities, Chinese Tea Sales Unprecedentedly Prosperous

The sales of Chinese silk and tea to the European market have been particularly prosperous recently, a rare phenomenon since the European war. Prices have also increased. Details are recorded as follows:

The external sales of Chinese silk have always been dominated by European countries, occupying an important position in foreign trade goods. Since the outbreak of the European war, foreign firms stationed in Shanghai have stopped placing orders, resulting in a large surplus of silk factories' inventory and a decline in silk prices. Now that most foreign ships have resumed sailing, the transportation of goods to Europe is no longer hindered. Foreign firms in various countries are placing more orders for Chinese silk to prevent the European war from expanding and still be able to operate as usual. They have ordered foreign firms in Shanghai to purchase Chinese silk as much as possible, and large quantities have been shipped to Europe in recent days. The Japanese side is coveting our country's overseas market and is dumping inferior silk at lower prices, implementing an economic encroachment conspiracy. Although Chinese silk has been hit by this, it is still selling very well to European countries due to its excellent quality.

Tea Industry Sources Reveal Prosperous Export Numbers, Chinese Tea exports have European markets as biggest consumer by quantity, followed by the Indonesian archipelago, along with US and Russian territories. Previous European war affairs put a stop to Chinese companies exporting tea to Europe. As shipping has become more available, all backlogged teas have been shipped out of Shanghai, with Jardine Matheson, Union, Ewo, and Jardine Henderson tea firms all back in business. Both red and green teas are being shipped to Europe, with prices ranging from seventy-two or seventy-three yuan to one hundred seventy or eighty yuan. Averages have seen increases of twenty-three yuan to thirty-forty yuan, tea prices and sale numbers are an unprecedented boon post-war. Shipments to the United States and the South Seas are also seeing high numbers, which is an important help to the war-time economy. According to the Municipal Council Health Department's report on the 5th of this month, there are now houses, with a total of 38,819 refugees.

### Japanese National Arrested by Police for Secretly Photographing a News Agency, Clarification Reveals Employee of Continental Times, Three Japanese Nationals Released by Police

The UK Rapid News Agency, located at No. 316, Times Building, No. 160 Edward Road, suddenly had three Japanese nationals bring a camera to the front of the agency at 6:00 p.m. yesterday, set off magnesium flares, and take pictures of the agency's facade. They were discovered, and an alarm was sounded. A large number of constables were stationed near the Times Building. Hearing the alarm, they rushed to the scene and arrested the three Japanese nationals, but they refused to hand over the film. They were later sent to the police station. According to the three Japanese nationals, they were employees of the Continental Times. The police immediately called the Continental Times to inquire. The newspaper then sent someone to the police station to admit that the three Japanese nationals were employees of the newspaper and stated that the newspaper instructed the three of them to take pictures of the front of the Rapid News Agency. The police asked why they took pictures of the agency's facade. They said that the Rapid News Agency was an anti-Japanese organization and published anti-Japanese news in Chinese and foreign newspapers, so they took this action. The police then asked the Rapid News Agency how to handle this matter. According to the agency officials, as long as they retrieved the film, there would be no other requirements. The employees of the Continental Times spoke in a firm tone and said that if they needed to retrieve the film, they should go to the newspaper in Hongkou. The police considered that the case was not important and released the three Japanese nationals at around 8:00 p.m.

### Large Quantities of National Rice Being Transported to Shanghai, Food Panic Subsides, Rice Shops Reduce Rice Purchases, Market Management Committee Standardizes Fees for Businesses

With sources of national rice decided to be dredged, being transported in a steady stream for Shanghai distribution, the food supply for the entire Shanghai market is gradually stabilizing. Rice prices will soon fall. Transport permits for Wuhu, Suzhou, Changshu, Wuxi and other rice-producing areas will soon be negotiated. Merchants and traders are actively selling. Two or three ships came down the river yesterday. More than a dozen cars of rice and grain were loaded onto trains and transported to Kunshan, Tongli, Jiashan and other places. More than 6,000 bags of new rice were transported by ship. Yesterday, rice prices continued to fall by two or three yuan or three or four yuan. The market trading was sluggish. Buyers watched and waited. A total of more than 5,000 bags were traded in the morning. The Rice Shop Trade Council and the Market Management Committee have recently stipulated that businesses should pay market fees. It has been approved by the 50th decision-making meeting. The details are recorded as follows:

Sources Dredged, Large Quantities Awaiting Transport

The food panic for the entire Shanghai market has passed. The rice-producing areas have experienced even water supply this year. The late rice is abundant. Sources have been dredged and are awaiting to be transported to Shanghai for distribution by boats and vehicles. It is reported that although taxes and levies have been collected locally, the price per stone is within 20 yuan. Merchants and traders are actively proceeding and negotiating for shipment. At present, the rice and grain shipped from Jiashan and Nangang, Fengjing and other cities and counties along the Shanghai-Jiashan Railway has gradually increased, from more than 5,000 or 6,000 bags per day to more than 10,000 bags. The number of rice purchases by rice shops in Shanghai has been significantly reduced compared to a few months ago. Therefore, the later sales are sluggish, and the inventory will gradually increase month by month. The daily rice demand has decreased. It is reported that the daily rice demand was at least more than 10,000 bags in the past, but now it is only about 7,000 or 8,000 bags. Therefore, it is expected that the food supply for the entire Shanghai market will stabilize, and the hidden worries of citizens have subsided.

Management Committee Stipulates Fee Payments for Businesses

The Rice Shop Trade Council and the Market Management Committee convened the 50th decision-making committee meeting on the 1st of this month to discuss the fee payment methods for businesses in the market. The market has posted the 90th public notice yesterday, saying, "According to the decision of the 50th Market Management Committee meeting on the 1st of this month, due to the increase in various expenses with the trend, the fee payment for businesses has been re-stipulated and listed as follows: (A) 10 yuan per month for each trade. It is stipulated that each trade has a maximum of eight people and may not be increased. (B) 4 yuan per month for each trade without a license. It is stipulated that each trade has four people. If you need to add a license, it is 1 yuan per person per month. (C) 4 yuan per month for each dealer. It is stipulated that each dealer has four people. If you need to add a license, it is 1 yuan per person per month. (D) 1.5 yuan per month per broker. The fees to be paid in each of the above items will be collected starting from this winter. In addition to other notices and separate letters, this public announcement is recorded for public knowledge. This is announced."

### Yih Hua Company's De Yao Ship Detained Yesterday by Japanese and Puppet Regime, Ordered by Puppet Police to Sail to the Fish Market, A Total of 13 Foreign Ships Detained Recently

The De Yao ship of Yih Hua Shipping Company, which operates between Shanghai and Beisha, was sailing from Qinglong Port to Shanghai yesterday morning with passengers and goods. According to usual practice, it should sail to Pier No. 12, Public Bund for parking. However, when it sailed to the river near Lujiazui, it was detained by the Japanese army and commanded by puppet naval forces. After boarding the ship and asking to review the manifest, without explaining the reason, the ship was detained and ordered to sail to Yangshupu Fish Market. At noon, the Water Police Department of the Japanese Consulate notified the Yih Hua Shipping Company on Guangdong Road of this move, but also did not explain the reason. The company has strongly denied the general speculation that the ship was carrying Chinese guerrillas. According to reporters, the Japanese side has recently detained many small foreign merchant ships, more than 12 coastal ships. They are still forced to anchor outside Wusongkou, causing great damage to the Far East shipping industry of foreign merchants. The detention of the De Yao ship is another record of this incident.

### Japanese Forces Seek to Force Vaccinations

According to a recent report in the English China Press, a Japanese language paper reports that the Shanghai Japanese Epidemic Prevention Commission, at a Thursday afternoon meeting at the Japanese General Association Hall, in Penglu, discussed methods of prevention and of shipping vessel inspections before passing a resolution to forcibly vaccinate Japanese nationals, Chinese, and other residents within areas controlled by the puppet regime, in an effort to prevent the spread of smallpox.

Two Japanese soldiers were patrolling the location, holding tools for fixing barbed wire. Local residents also claimed that the puppet railway bureau was set to take control of the Bazilu railway hospital to house refugees, inspiring fear among those refugees.

### After a Order to Settle Foreign Exchange for Exported Goods, Ningbo Cargo Ships Rerouted, Xin Anna to Xinghua, En De to Hong Kong

After the Zhejiang Customs Office decreed that Shanghai-bound exported goods from Ningbo had to settle using foreign exchange, various industries in Ningbo telegraphed the Finance Department to request a revised order. However, the Finance Department had not yet given any response. Aside from a minority of necessary Shanghai-bound goods, the majority of exported goods were temporarily put on hold. Due to these circumstances, Shanghai-bound goods were drastically reduced, leading to ships on that route being rerouted. The American ship Xin Anna of the Weili Han Company, for example, changed course to Xinghua after returning to Shanghai from Zhenhai the day before. In addition, the China-Italy Company ship En De, which is set to return to Shanghai soon, has made the decision to reroute to Hong Kong starting on the eleventh. The Da Pu, managed by the Norwegian Hua Lun Company, was delayed until 4 PM yesterday, holding over 1000 passengers. The Italian Yihua Company ship Bao Li, after returning to Shanghai on the 3rd, had plans for drydock maintenance, but due to the number of passengers and after inspecting the hull, made the decision to stay in operation as usual and depart today in the afternoon.

### Japanese Puppet Regime Desperately Attempts To Control Shanghai-area Land Goods and Fruit, Branch Market Set to Open in Southwestern Shanghai, Small Number of Chinese National Involved

Regarding the desperate attempt by the Japanese puppet regime to control the city's goods and fruit, this affair is currently proceeding at a breakneck pace. As this reporter knows, the Four Lines Warehouse has been determined as the general market, with locations on Avenue du President Doumer and Hongqiao Rd selected for branch markets in western Shanghai. The side of 16 Pu (Old City) is still pending. Those in the land goods and fruit trade have adopted an extremely firm attitude, watching and awaiting developments. It is said that there is a small number of land goods merchants who are scheming to cut off competition from within. Given that produce is essential to the livelihood of all Shanghai residents, future developments bear scrutiny. The market is rumored to be run jointly by government and merchants, with agreements from the Military Affairs Council, Headquarters of the Garrison, Ministry of Military Affairs, Armies of the Sea and Land, as well as the Puppet City Government.

### Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Declares That It Has Not Sent Members to Sell Goods

As prices have been rising and allowances have increased in the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, it recently sent a letter to bodies requesting that they continue to solicit donations in accordance with the resolution of the first general meeting of members, on the premise that it does not hinder their operations, in order to provide relief. In addition to asking various organizations to continue soliciting donations, the association has never sent anyone to sell any goods in order to help provide disaster relief. Recently, it has been discovered that someone is selling printing ink to all walks of life, which is obviously an unscrupulous person who is impersonating the association in an attempt to defraud people. In addition to sending letters to all parties concerned, it is hoped that all walks of life will pay attention and not be deceived.

### Municipal Council Police Department Rumored to Establish New Japanese Desk

According to Japanese sources, the Public Concession Municipal Council Police Department established a Special Affairs Desk after the August 13 Incident at the request of the Japanese side. However, the status and authority of the desk were lower than other desks, which the Japanese side considered to be unsatisfactory. Therefore, Akagi, the Japanese Special Deputy Superintendent of the Police Department, negotiated with Bowen, the Superintendent. As a result, the Police Department first abolished the Special Affairs Desk and established the Japanese Desk instead, raising its status and appointing the Japanese Deputy Superintendent Higawara as the chief of the desk. The desk is directly under the Superintendent. The affairs of the desk are still to suppress anti-Japanese elements.

### Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade Award Ceremony - Thirty-Seven Recipients

Mainland News reports: The Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade held an award ceremony yesterday (the 5th) at 5:00 PM. Thirty-seven Chinese members of the fire brigade, who have served for 20 to 30 years, were awarded medals by the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, for their dedication to their duties. The award recipients came from the Yangshupu, Hongkou, Central, Xinzha, Yichang Road, and Jing'an Temple fire brigades. Five of them were employees of the fire brigade workshop.

### Bandit Executed in Xiaochuan Shakou

The bandit Lu A'xiang of Xiaochuan Shakou gathered a gang for robbery and extortion. The villagers feared his tyranny and dared not speak out. Recently, a certain unit of the regular guerrilla force, acting on secret information from the villagers, discovered the bandit's whereabouts. On the 2nd, they completely routed the gang, and the bandit leader Lu A'xiang has been executed by firing squad. The villagers in the surrounding areas celebrated with joy.

### Exemption from Typhoon Tax - High Tide Expected Again in the Huangpu River

The observatory has detected that the chance of typhoons hitting Shanghai in the future has decreased. Starting next month, the entire Chinese coastline will be exempt from the typhoon tax. At that time, domestic astronomical institutions will no longer report on typhoon paths. Furthermore, according to the Shanghai Bureau of Conservancy, a high tide is expected again in the Huangpu River starting from the 13th of this month. Its magnitude will not be less than the current one. This high tide will begin on the 13th and last until the 18th. The highest level will reach 12 feet 2 inches, and the lowest will be 10 feet 05 inches. Considering that the height of the Bund waterfront of the Huangpu River is only 13 feet, the water level will be very close to the shore, which is worth noting. In addition, the river current will be particularly turbulent during the high tide, so those navigating ships should also pay attention.

### Major Shanghai Stores Hold Charity Bazaar to Aid Afflicted Chinese - Market Set Up at the British Girls' School on Haig Road Starting This Afternoon at 2:30 PM, Proceeds to Benefit the Renji Benevolent Society

Today (October 7th) at 1:30 PM, a charity bazaar to aid the poor and sick will be held at the British Girls' School, 425 Haig Road. All profits will be donated to the Renji Hospital Women's Auxiliary Society.

Those who participated in the Society's first charity bazaar on October 15th of last year will surely remember the lively scene. It is said that the total income reached over three thousand Chinese dollars. More than one thousand dollars have already been used to help outpatients, and the remaining two-thirds have been used to purchase handicraft materials for inpatients and to compensate the social workers specially hired by the Society.

The Shanghai Sincere, Wing On, Sun Sun, and The Sun department stores, as well as the Wing On Textile Factory, the Majestic Hotel, Keseling Western Restaurant, Sullivan Confectionery Company, and others, recognizing the Society's excellent achievements and admirable intentions, have specially donated large quantities of snacks, candies, toys, food, and clothing to be displayed at the charity market, allowing people from all walks of life to choose and buy at will. The handicrafts made by members and patients will also be sold at the market. Therefore, compassionate gentlemen, ladies, and young people should take their children, younger siblings, and cousins ​​to stroll around there. If you get tired, you can sit down for refreshments and listen to a speech by Lady Missup, the wife of the British Assessor. Fortunately, there are many things to see and buy, so feel free to take your time and choose as much as you like. When you go home, you will be "fully loaded," and your heart will be full of joy, because "doing good is the greatest joy."

The Renji Hospital Women's Auxiliary Society has only been established for over two years. Speaking of the Society's founding, there is a history worth recounting. Recalling when the sounds of cannons were heard in the suburbs, two tragedies occurred in succession: one in front of the Great World entertainment center and the other in the bustling Nanjing Road. At that time, the hospitals in Shanghai really could not accommodate so many injured people. However, hospitals are, after all, hospitals. They cannot, like theaters, put up a sign saying "Full House Today, Please Come Early Tomorrow." So they had no choice but to accept everyone. However, it was impossible in reality to allow "those who come" to lie in hospital beds and enjoy the usual treatment of patients. Therefore, the tragic situation was truly beyond description. At this time, many British women, without prior arrangement, went to Renji Hospital to share the volunteer nursing work and, in the spirit of humanity, justice, and compassion, did their best to help the afflicted Chinese. Later, because of their shared goals, they formally established the Auxiliary Society. As a result, the scope of service expanded day by day, the effectiveness of the work became more and more apparent, and the strength of the group gradually became evident.

In the beginning, all the members were Westerners. Later, Chinese women, not wanting to be left behind in doing good deeds, enthusiastically joined one after another. This made the work progress more smoothly, and there were no language difficulties between the staff and the patients. When the Chinese army withdrew west, Shanghai immediately became an "isolated island." However, the Society continued to relieve the suffering of others in accordance with its original intention of serving the community. They all knew that what patients needed was not only medical treatment but also compassion and understanding.

These "living Guanyins" with the heart of a Bodhisattva - the members of the Auxiliary Society - not only do their best to fulfill their obligations, but also have to pay out of their own pockets. Not to mention anything else, just the membership fee alone costs five dollars a year. However, if you want to contribute more, then paying one dollar is enough, because the principle of "money for money, effort for effort" applies here as well. Under the leadership of Chairperson Ms. Liu Wu Zhuosheng and Vice-Chairpersons Madam Ni and Mrs. F.W. Poate, the Society's affairs have made significant progress. Speaking of Chairperson Liu, many people must know her, and the students who have been taught by her must be able to recall her patient and guiding style. As for other responsible personnel, they are as follows:

Chairperson of the Occupational Therapy Committee: Mrs. H. Maxted. English Secretary: Ms. Yin (Mrs. Bernard Read). Chinese Secretary: Mrs. Zhang Yongquan. Treasurer: Mrs. Hou Xiangchuan. Library Committee Member: Ms. Wang Xin'en. Chairperson of the Infant Care Committee: Ms. Chen Jingling, Madam Pan. Chairperson of the Clothing and Fabric Committee: Madam Xu, Vice-Chairpersons Mrs. W.M. McLennan, Mrs. P. Farqubatson. Chairperson of the Visitation Committee: Mrs. G. Fubdkay Andrew. Chairperson of the Children's Toy Committee: Mrs. H.G. Stock. Western Publicist: Miss E. Adiam. Chinese Publicist: Ms. Wang Peizhen. Hospital Representative Nurse: Miss Tayler. Member Representative: Ms. Zheng Shengzu Xin (Director of the Women's College of Shanghai University).

After reading the above list, you can understand the general outline of the Society's work. However, it still seems necessary to add a brief explanation here. For example, the term "occupational therapy" is still very new in China. Its purpose is very simple: to relieve the monotony of life for patients during the healing period; as for obtaining the cost of light manual labor after the patient recovers to supplement daily living expenses, that is secondary. The books and magazines provided by the Society's Library Committee rely entirely on the generous donations of people from all walks of life. Patients can borrow them to read, which can pass the time, relieve boredom, and increase knowledge, and the benefits are considerable. The two committees for children's toys and clothing and fabric are dedicated to soliciting broken clothes, old clothes, and dolls, etc., and then mending and repairing them before distributing them to patients. In addition to asking people to sponsor infants, the Infant Care Committee also manages the affairs of protecting discharged women and children.

It is said that once upon a time, a minor girl who looked like a maid was accompanied by her mistress to the hospital to give birth. The child born soon died, and this "poor Qiu Xiang" then returned to her master's home. The master was the one who raped her and made her pregnant. Therefore, the wife could not help but feel a little jealous of her; now seeing her return, she naturally regarded her as a thorn in her side and constantly abused her. One night, just when the northwest wind was blowing very hard, she actually got her drunk on strong liquor and pushed her out into the dark street outside the wall, preparing to let her freeze to death alive. At that time, she was only thirteen years old.

But that traumatized mind was still able to recall the two words "Renji." Because only at "Renji" had she received comfort and pity. In a semi-numb state, she vaguely uttered the sounds "Renji, Renji." Passersby, hearing the sound and seeing the situation, could not help but feel compassion and brought her to the place she mentioned. When she arrived there, she gradually woke up and knew that no one would beat her or scold her anymore, and that she could not go back to the master's house. So she revealed all the facts. Afterwards, the Auxiliary Society sent her to the "Gate of Hope" - the Jiliang Institute - to receive education and protection with other women who had escaped the pit of fire. The police authorities filed a public lawsuit against the master and his wife. As a result, the court punished the mistress with the crime she deserved and sentenced the master to 18 months in prison. Such cases are too numerous to mention.

This kind of social service work is worthy of promotion and implementation, and tomorrow's charity bazaar is also "worthy" of taking a look and buying something. Now, the organizing staff are "working hard" to make sure that everyone, adults and children alike, leaves with a smile. How do I know? There is a work distribution table for the preparatory committee as proof. The table is as follows:

(1) Lottery, Patient Handicrafts - Mrs. Maxted. (2) Performances, Sweets - Mrs. Frederick. (3) Refreshments - Mrs. Young. (4) Children's Supplies - Mrs. Beynon. (5) Chinese Goods - Mrs. Huang Zhenqiu. (6) Household Goods - Mrs. Poate. (7) "Fishing" Game - Mrs. Gorlovsky. (8) Homemade Products (such as peanut butter, fruit jam, etc.) - Mrs. Read.

### Detailed Account of the Parricide Case: The Father's Violent and Cruel Nature Abused His Wife - Two Sons Secretly Conspired to Put Him to Death - Infused Electric Current and Then Dismembered the Body - The Daughter Discovered It and Secretly Reported It to the Police for Arrest

Ten years ago, in the Shanghai International Settlement, a case occurred in which an unmarried woman named Zhang Wenqing killed her stepmother. It caused a sensation at the time. Later, Ms. Zhang was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment and is still serving her sentence in the women's prison of the First Special Court. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 5th of this month, a case of sons killing their father occurred in Haig Road in the Shanghai International Settlement. A brief account was published in yesterday's newspaper. Now, the details are recorded below:

Zhou Yongjie

Was a native of Ningbo, and was of an age nearing knowing one's destiny. He used to be the manager of a Sino-French pharmacy in the Northeast, and was skilled in business and had some savings in his hands. Later, due to old age, he retired and came to Shanghai to live as a gentleman. He built a house at 228 and a half Haig Road. The house was a three-story Chinese-style building, where he lived with his wife, Ms. Jing (48 years old, from Shanghai), his eldest son, Qinji (28 years old), his younger son, Qinxiang (21 years old), and his eldest daughter, Qinzhu (25 years old, still unmarried). However, Zhou Yongjie was quite violent and stubborn, which led to a weak relationship between husband, wife, children. Zhou's wife, Ms. Jing, had heart disease, and Zhou

Treated Her Even Worse.

Verbal abuse and mutual beatings were often heard. On one occasion, Zhou severely beat his wife and then evicted her. After two or three weeks, although she was persuaded to return, Zhou was still angry and did not speak to her. Every midnight, he would make excuses to yell loudly, non-stop until dawn. All of this was deliberately done to oppose his wife, intending to make her leave the world early. His two sons, Qinji and Qinxiang, witnessed their mother suffering and tried to dissuade him, but he turned his anger on his two sons, cut off their financial support, and did not allow them to study (because Qinxiang is currently studying at Datong School in Pudong). Qinji and others thought that their father's

Situation Had Changed Greatly.

If this continued, they feared that their mother's life would be in danger. In order to strike first, Qinxiang initiated the plan to kill their father. From then on, the two brothers often used the Gujiazhai Garden in the French Concession as a place for secret meetings. After several discussions, on the 4th of this month, they decided to take action. They purchased wires, electric light bulbs, a saw, screws, and a drill, preparing to electrocute their father and then dismember the body to destroy the evidence. After the materials were prepared, they returned home without saying a word and had dinner together as usual, sleeping in separate rooms. At around 1:00 AM on the 5th, Qinxiang got up and woke up Qinji, and they

Sneaked Into Their Father's Room.

Using the bulb to connect the electric current, they separately touched his head and feet. Zhou Yongjie died unknowingly. They moved the body to the balcony and went out to buy a bottle of sulfuric acid and two bottles of nitric acid, and a wooden box. They returned home to carry out the dismemberment. First, they cut off his head and placed it in a bucket. Then, they sawed off his legs, wrapped them in towels, and placed them next to the body. Unexpectedly, while they were dismembering the body, their sister, Qinzhu, learned of the situation. Believing that her brothers' actions were inhumane, she secretly reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detectives Zhu Jihuang, Liang Junshan, Wu Qilan, and Western detectives to

Investigate.

They saw Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang carrying out the dismemberment work. They arrested them, along with the corpse, Zhou's wife Ms. Zhou Jing, and the wires, bulbs, saws, screws, drills, and other items, and took them all to the police station, where they were detained separately. The body of Zhou Shui-jie was taken to the mortuary. Yesterday morning, the police sent Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang to the mortuary for questioning and took Zhou Jing to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court, where they charged them with the crime of killing a direct ascendant relative in accordance with Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The police lawyer Wang Shoutang detailed the above situation and requested a postponement. Ms. Zhou Jing testified that her husband had

Abused Her Severely.

However, regarding the point of conspiring to commit murder, she claimed that she did not know about it beforehand, and although she knew about it after the death, she did not participate in the dismemberment work because she was frightened and fainted. Judge Chuan Lin ordered her to be detained pending further investigation, and postponed the hearing for seven days to investigate and verify the facts. The prosecutor's office sent a prosecutor to the scene to verify that the body was indeed killed. The body was handed over to the family for burial, and the murderers were detained pending further investigation.

### Signboard Blown Down by Typhoon - Kills a Person - Shop Owner Sentenced to One Year in Prison

On the morning of August 30th of this year, when a typhoon hit Shanghai, a horizontal signboard installed above the gate of the Kyoto Catering Company at 983 Avenue Joffre, due to years of disrepair and corrosion of the iron hooks, was blown down by the wind. A woman surnamed Wang Chen, a native of Ningbo, happened to be passing by and was struck in the head and died before she could be treated. At the same time, another pedestrian was also injured in the head and went to the hospital for treatment and recovered. Now, the French police have found that Lin Weirong, the owner of the Kyoto Catering Company, a native of Ningbo, did not pay attention to it beforehand. On the 1st of this month, Lin Weirong was sent to the Second Special Court, where the French Concession authorities filed a public prosecution against him for the crime of causing death by negligence. Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated him and ordered Lin to be released on bail pending further investigation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang opened the court again for a continued hearing. The defendant Lin Weirong did not appear, but his defense lawyer and the witness, a painter named Chen Tingsheng, appeared in court and testified that the signboard had been repaired two years ago, but it had been installed for twelve years. It was indeed blown down by a strong wind. The court verified the testimony and ordered the debate to be opened. Believing that the defendant had indeed been negligent in preventing it beforehand and should bear responsibility, it announced the end of the debate and sentenced Lin Weirong to one year of imprisonment for causing death by negligence. The defendant was detained in the detention center pending the appeal period.

### Forcing Good Women Into Prostitution - Two Criminals Detained Pending Sentencing

Wang Boqing, who opened a brothel at 143, Lane 1, 14, Yunnan Road, usually colluded with his concubine Tang Lingmei to go out under the guise of helping others to entice good women to work as prostitutes. Recently, Tang Lingmei was hired by Fei Songsheng, a native of Huzhou, at 4, Jiande Lane, Yu Yuan Road. On the nth day of last month, she designed to entice Fei's seventeen-year-old niece, Fei Huamei, and Fei's relative, Li Jufang (also seventeen years old), to go out and abscond together. The two women were lured to a small inn that night and raped by Wang Boqing one after another. Then, they were taken to his brothel and forced to receive guests at the Great World entertainment center. After the case occurred, detectives Liang Junshan from the Jing'an Temple Police Station arrested Xu Jingan, Zhang Hua, Wang Peifang, Zhao Xiaonan, Yang Shunquan, Tang Yunsheng, and other suspects. Fei and Li were rescued, and a seventeen-year-old girl named Li Suzhen was also brought to the police station. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the court continued the interrogation. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that Wang Peifang and Tang Yunsheng had been arrested for selling, enticing, and forcing good women into prostitution, but the others were not involved. He requested their release. After the judge interrogated them, Wang and Tang were ordered to be detained pending sentencing. Xu Jingan, Zhang Hua, Zhao Xiaonan, and Yang Shunquan were released. Fei and Li were handed over to their families to be taken back. Li Suzhen was temporarily kept at the Jiliang Institute.

### Excavating Ancestral Graves - Ruling to Suspend Trial - First Confirm Ownership

Su Langqing, a native of Lijiazhai, Leishangda Road, French Concession, sixty-six years old, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Li Shihua, who lived in the same house, and his clansmen Su Fusheng, Li Guoxiang, Li Guanlin, Li Xiangqi, and Li Jinchang, and other six people, of excavating ancestral graves. He requested an investigation and attached a civil lawsuit to recover the remains of his ancestors. According to the complaint, the plaintiff's seventh-generation ancestor sold one mu and four fen of land in the 28th Bao, 12th Jia, north of Zhaozhu Road to Li Shihua's ancestor during the Xianfeng years, and there were four ancestral graves on the land. There was a deed of sale, which has been more than eighty years. On August 20th of this year, Li Shihua suddenly hired Su Fusheng and the other defendants to excavate the graves without permission. The plaintiff learned of this and reported it to the Beitang Road Police Station, but the prevention was ineffective. He requested an investigation and recovery of the bones of his ancestors. According to the complaint, the court, at 3:00 PM yesterday, opened a trial by Judge Sun Penghan. The defendants hired lawyers such as Wang Shouan to defend them. The plaintiff only claimed that the ancestral graves were excavated, but failed to provide sufficient evidence. The defendant Li Shihua testified that the land was passed down from his ancestors, and the graves were the Su family's. This time, he sold the land and ordered the owner, Su Fushun's son Su Menggen, to move it away. Su Fusheng testified that the graves contained his ancestors. His son established his will and ordered his son to relocate the burial, and it had nothing to do with the plaintiff. The plaintiff's land was to the south. After interrogating the other defendants, the court held that the two sides had their own opinions, but the plaintiff did not provide any evidence. It was ruled that the trial be suspended, and the two parties were ordered to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court to confirm the ownership of the graves before proceeding with the trial.

### Male and Female Drug Traffickers - Sentenced to Fifteen Years Each

Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao ascended the bench in the First Criminal Division and announced the verdict: Jin Ziqing and Wang Li were jointly selling drugs and were sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment each. Xu A'er and Li An were acquitted. The confiscated heroin and other drugs were confiscated according to the list. Zhou Heshang, a fishmonger from Dachang, 32 years old, usually sold his goods at a higher price, which was envied by other colleagues in the Datong Road vegetable market. Yesterday morning at about 8:00, when Zhou took fish and shrimp to the vegetable market for sale, his colleagues firmly refused to allow him to sell separately and beat Zhou, causing injuries to his abdomen. After the Chinese police intervened, Zhou was seriously injured and was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. At 8:15, he arrived at the hospital, but due to injuries to his stomach, he died at 9:10 before he could be treated. The police searched for the murderers at the scene of the incident and arrested one fishmonger, who was detained pending interrogation. Zhou's body was sent to the mortuary for examination.

### Case of Postal Worker Forcibly Transferred - Expected to be Resolved Satisfactorily

Chen Daquan, the leader of the Undeliverable Mail Group of the Shanghai Post Office, transferred postal worker Chen Guoxian out of personal spite, which aroused the indignation of all postal workers, who collectively requested the authorities to investigate thoroughly.

### Public Concession Police - Searching for Flower Club Gambling Den - Gambler Jiang A'bao and Others Fled and Have Not Been Captured

Flower club gambling is extremely harmful. Recently, flower club gambling has been rampant in Hongkou. Jiang Asheng, Wai Tou Bao Lin, Wang Abaod, Yu Deli and others openly set up a public gambling den at No. 10, Baoan Lane, Haining Road, gathering people for profit. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret, and the Public Concession Police learned of it yesterday. They dispatched a large number of detectives to search and arrest them. Unexpectedly, Jiang and others had already escaped without a trace. The police are now strictly hunting them down.

### Railways Being Built in the City Center - Military Equipment Being Implemented - Approximately 60,000 Square Meters of Muslim Cemetery in Zhenru Occupied - Muslims Plan to Telegraph Japanese Muslims to Uphold Justice

Since the Battle of Shanghai, in order to achieve long-term occupation, the Japanese have been implementing various military equipment in the city center. In order to expand traffic and facilitate transportation, they plan to build a railway in Zhenru, directly reaching Baoshan, Wusong, Jiangwan and other places. The Shanghai Muslim Cemetery and the Public Land of the Cattle Industry Association, near Zhenru Station, have been included in the railway line, occupying 60,000 square meters of farmland. The Japanese have notified the gravediggers there, ordering them to relocate the graves, arousing the anger of all

Muslims.

According to a reporter from Daguang News Agency, after receiving the news, the Executive Committee of the Muslim Church sent people to Zhenru to inspect the site. They saw that the Japanese had built a model station building and had also set up route markers. Observing the situation, it seemed that they would officially start construction soon. Yesterday, they visited the person in charge of the Muslim community, who said that regarding the Japanese occupation of the Zhenru cemetery and the order to relocate the graves, they had convened an emergency meeting of Muslim representatives and decided to argue with reason. Because according to

Muslim Religious Regulations,

After a believer dies, his body is placed in a bottomless coffin and buried in the ground. Therefore, after a long time, the remains have assimilated with the soil. If one wants to relocate the grave and re-examine the bones, it is difficult and impossible in fact. Therefore, they have sent people to negotiate with the Japanese, requesting a change in the railway route to preserve the current state of the cemetery. If no result is obtained, they will telegram Japanese Muslims to uphold justice and request them to find a way to stop the Japanese military to avoid the Muslim cemetery from suffering misfortune.

### Change of Rent to U.S. Dollars, Denial of Lease Termination: Tenant Mrs. Taylor Loses Lawsuit

Mrs. Taylor leased two houses at 433-435 Great Western Road from Li (i.e., Li Dingshu, 34 years old, from Hefei) on April 1st of this year. The rent was 175 yuan per month, and the lease was for one and a half years, expiring on October 1st of next year. Recently, Li notified Mrs. Taylor that due to foreign exchange issues, the rent of 175 yuan must be paid in U.S. dollars, otherwise the lease would be terminated immediately. Mrs. Taylor then filed a petition with the Civil Division of the Special Court, accusing landlord Li Dingshu of seeking a judgment that the lease contract was valid and that the lease could not be terminated. After reviewing the case, the court found that Article 6 of the contract stated that if Party A (the landlord) wished to terminate the lease of the premises rented by Party B (the tenant) midway, they must give one month's notice, and thus the contract could be terminated according to law. Therefore, the court ruled against Mrs. Taylor. Mrs. Taylor was dissatisfied and retained lawyer Zhou Fu to appeal to the High Second Branch Court. The hearing has already concluded, and Judge Xia Xiong ruled yesterday that Mrs. Taylor's appeal against Li Dingshu's request to prevent the termination of the lease contract was "dismissed." The appellant shall bear the costs of the litigation. If she is not satisfied with the judgment of this court, she may still appeal to the Supreme Court according to law.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor,

Upon reading the news column in your esteemed newspaper yesterday, which stated that over a hundred Japanese soldiers and police officers in trucks arrived at No. 99 Great Western Road, occupied the houses, and forcibly evicted all the residents, while the Third Shelter of the Cilian Branch attached to the interior was not interfered with and is now guarded by military police, with a side door opened for refugees to enter and exit, we were greatly surprised. While it is true that the police from the Great Western Road police station came to investigate our shelter, the aforementioned events did not occur. We fear that the report is based on inaccurate rumors. Therefore, we are writing to your newspaper to request that you investigate the matter.

Sincerely,
The Third Shelter of the Cilian Branch
October 6th

### Losing More Than You Gain

— Pei Chu

The era when European countries seized colonies from less developed regions outside Europe, returned laden with riches, and enjoyed them at will is over and will never return. There are two reasons: first, some less developed countries are striving to become strong and seeking progress, making other countries hesitant to invade them lightly; second, all the land that could be divided has already been divided and belongs to someone, and there is nothing left for any upstart to covet. The result of this shift in the situation is not a sudden act that happens overnight, so trying to change this situation is not something that can be achieved by violence in a day or two.

Some upstarts stubbornly refuse to believe this principle and insist on copying the old tricks of the great powers of the past, using imperialistic methods to stir up trouble and plunder from east to west. As a result, they either gain nothing or lose more than they gain, which is worse than gaining nothing and results in great losses. Japan is an "original sinner," the first to invade China, and is now trapped in a quagmire from which it cannot extricate itself. As long as China continues to resist, the outcome is predictable. Italy's invasion of Abyssinia required great effort and cost an unknown amount of energy, but all it gained was a rocky field. And this rocky field is now growing thorns, preventing them from living there in peace, and forcing them to seek help from Emperor Selassie of Abyssinia. Finally, there is Germany, which is now the focus of everyone's attention. What did it gain by destroying Czechoslovakia and Poland?

Since nationalism replaced statism, everyone knows that no strong country can destroy any small, individual nation. Just as Czechoslovakia and Poland were able to restore their countries in the past, they will naturally be able to do so again in the future. Therefore, what Germany gains at present will ultimately be lost in the future. And even in the present, even if we say that Czechoslovakia and Poland, especially Poland recently, can be temporarily gained by Germany, what Germany loses is far greater than what it gains. This is not a loss of Germany's military strength or material resources, nor is it a loss of manpower, but a loss of the hearts of the people, a loss that is greatest and cannot be compensated! What is this? It is that the people of Nazi Germany can henceforth freely absorb communist ideas. Given that Germany is a country that is most suitable for the development of communism, a first-class industrial power, and an extremely poor country, the overthrow of the Nazi government is inevitable and rapid.

Doesn't Germany, like Italy and Japan, know the consequences? Why do they still do such things that lose more than they gain and result in great losses? If you say they are stupid, they will naturally not admit it, but if you say they are wrong, even if they do not admit it, it is always an undeniable fact. In addition to the thought of greed, they have also added some vanity, so they are now in a dilemma and will eventually fall into an unbearable situation. What is called vanity is that they think they are a first-class power and must have a vast territory and acquire some colonies to decorate their facade. This is simply ridiculous, but they are precisely so concerned with saving face!

The ruling classes of these countries, fearing their own decline and inability to continue ruling, have no choice but to develop outward in order to maintain their position, so they have to use various pretexts to invade other countries. This is also a very valid reason. However, even if they calculate that their aggression will gradually succeed, and their own position can still be maintained through gradual effort, the success of aggression has limits, while the maintenance of position has no limits. In the future, they will still perish, lose more than they gain, no, lose greatly! Originally, their ruling method, fascism, is fundamentally wrong and incurable. Let us see, all the present tricks are about to come!

### From "Bei-jing"

— Senior Brother

A friend came from "Bei-jing." After I accompanied him to appreciate the extravagance of Shanghai, it was already dusk. So we decided to "feed our brains." He was afraid he wouldn't be used to Southern cuisine, so I specially found a Tianjin restaurant. As soon as we entered, we heard a familiar Tianjin accent.

"Eat somethin'? You, eh?" It was that professional smile again.

We casually ordered a few dishes, and of course we also wanted to drink some wine. "What kinda wine? You, eh? Jia Pi? Bai Gan?..."

After drinking a glass of Bai Gan, my friend's face became flushed, and he naturally talked even more.

"Old Han, tell me some stories from 'Jing'!" I finally brought up the request that I hadn't had time to talk about all day.

My friend frowned, quietly ate two bites of food, and frowned with a red face as if he were thinking. Suddenly, out of nowhere, he began: "Now there are no unemployed people on the streets of Bei-jing!"

I listened attentively. I ate and drank while nodding and raising my head to show understanding and ask questions. Now I raised my head suspiciously, with a big "?" on my face.

"Do you want to know why? Because—because people without jobs are not allowed to stay in 'Bei-jing'!"

"Among the unemployed vagrants, there are bound to be some 'bad elements.' Usually, they can't be as law-abiding as employed 'citizens.' If there are no unemployed vagrants among the citizens, wouldn't the world be at peace! So everyone in 'Bei-jing' must have a job—of course I also have my job, I am an honorary accountant for a familiar shop."

"But this has made it difficult for those college students who are 'recuperating' in Bei-ping. Where can they find a job? ———— But college students have received higher education after all, and they can come up with ideas on the spur of the moment. They pooled some money and opened coffee shops. The money spent was limited, but the job was found. They even made a fortune. So now there are quite a few coffee shops opened in front of several universities. The shops are quite nicely decorated and have waitresses. Business is of course booming, and most of the customers are college students. ——— Black coffee, red lips, distinct colors, I guess this is what is called stimulation?"

"It is said that one opened in front of the ×× gate, with a capital of one thousand yuan, and after a few months, it has already earned more than two thousand. I hope the owner of this shop studied economics in the past, otherwise, his education —……"

My friend seemed deeply moved, and slowly sipped his wine, his face becoming even more flushed. Seeing that he seemed to want to sigh, I quickly preempted him with a sound: "Alas!——"

"Didn't you write me a few letters a while ago?"

I nodded.

"Oh, that really brought me a lot of trouble. I was invited to the headquarters of the military police. They asked me what kind of person wrote the letter. Of course, I could only tell the truth: 'A student.' They also asked me 'What is he to you?' I said: 'A cousin. A teenager who is in junior high school.' Fearing that you would cause some trouble, I stuttered and added these two sentences: 'A child, doesn't understand anything.'"

I made a face and stuck out my tongue.

The person who interrogated me was of course also a compatriot. Perhaps seeing that I was so embarrassed, he said: "Okay, it's nothing. ——— But it's best to write fewer letters in the future." Then he lowered his voice in a very friendly manner. After pausing for a while, my friend changed his tone:

"Things in 'Bei-jing' are simply like a tangled mess. I don't want to waste too much brainpower, so let me tell you a little about the situation on the road this time."

"People who are qualified to stay in 'Bei-jing' will not leave easily. It takes a lot of twists and turns to get that 'exit permit.' Every place you go on the road, you will inevitably be questioned. My exit permit was obtained through a friend. I spent some money, so I only waited a few days."

"I didn't have time to study the flood in Tianjin in detail. There, I didn't see any victims, but I saw a few couples sitting in small boats taking pictures." At this point he laughed happily; I also laughed happily, the matter was indeed very funny, we laughed reasonably.

After laughing enough, the conversation continued:

"When I arrived in Yantai, the streets of Yantai were busy drafting soldiers. The draft was very special: blocking both ends of the road, so all the pedestrians on this road were caught. They were taken to the command. If the store came to bail them out, there was still hope of being released: otherwise, you can stay there with peace of mind, and wait for a round number to be collected, and it is said that they will be loaded onto a ship and transported away——I will not drink any more wine. Let's not talk too much, let's eat."

The dishes were gone, and there was not much wine left: it was indeed time to eat. So I shouted: "Hey——!"

My friend was drinking tea, and I couldn't think of anything else to say for a while. Maybe I had drunk too much wine, and my head was a little heavy. Occasionally, I heard a few scattered words floating from the next seat, very beautiful Beijing dialect, but a bit harsh:

"... mutton... hot pot... when will I go back to hot pot..."

### Random Thoughts

— Yun Tian

Theory and practice cannot be separated, writing and action cannot conflict—whether in public or private life, one must be up to "standard." Standard is a level; it's not difficult to achieve, and it can be mentioned in writing; however, one should not place greater importance on beautiful writing (even if one has done one's best in practice), but rather on action. Good writing can be hidden away in a famous mountain, but a bad character will be passed down through the ages. Sakyamuni did not use writing to move people, and his greatness remains undiminished; Yan Song wrote beautiful poems about the mountains and forests, but to this day, people still understand his treacherousness. If you think that these stories are all copied from books and let out a cold laugh, then so be it!

The god of art wept at the symphony of jazz music and the sound of cannons, and she had already smelled the stench of corpses. The culture of the idle has not always been without progressiveness, but now it is retreating to the fire. But let it burn, burn brightly, so as not to fail the suffering Prometheus.

Afterwards, the stench of corpses will be gone.

Someone said, "The strange sounds of 'peng chai peng chai' in the ballroom are the most exquisite. It is the same as Zhuangzi tapping a skull with a horsewhip, hee!"

This person is naturally a literati, very ethereal. But unfortunately, Zhuangzi is only a philosopher, not a re-creator, even if the skull stands up straight and announces the philosophy of "the victory of death."

But the skull seems to have a reason for existence, otherwise Zhuangzi will drag his tail and leave. Haha, abandoned, abandoned, tap, tap!

A cultural warrior has his excellent traditions—courage and integrity; but there is no need to be hypocritical and deliberately straightforward, because the latter will be detrimental to himself. Build good "works" so that the fatal flaw is not seen. Frowning when you hear a hateful laugh is not enough. But never sublimate the essence. If, like Li Bai in front of others, you praise the reign of Kaiyuan as "extracting gold from the sand and mining jade from the stone, all obtaining their essence," it will only make yourself blush, which is the helpless thing of a hanger-on, although in Li Bai's case, it can be forgiven to some extent.

To put it simply: what we do, "in the end" is still not praised by bad guys, or regarded as comrades, but we will not die at their hands either.

### Homeward Journey

— Xiao Feng

The traces on the clear pond and shallow beach
Further imprinted with layers of mountain peaks.
The water flows, lamenting endless homesickness,
And one gazes endlessly at the smoke and clouds of the northern capital.

The autumn wind plays a high tune with a rustle,
Reeds flutter, full of white hair,
The wild geese in the long sky cry, vaguely still old acquaintances;
Only at first were we hurried companions on the same road,
Today, we greet each other with smiles.

Startling the dogs barking in the desolate village,
One also hears one's own familiar footsteps.
Heavily, the shoulder rubs against a blister
Straw sandals worn through pair after pair.

Strike a match,
Sucking the sooty early tobacco pipe with a sizzle;
In the thick-greased white copper head,
Bright and dark, a red light rises.

Let thoughts sublimate,
Following the wisp of green smoke rising from the corner of the mouth;
The half-opened thatched door under the weeds,
There is the dear mother, gazing with her blurry eyes.

### The Birthday of Cinema

— Pei Pei

Yesterday (October 6th) was the 45th anniversary of the birth of cinema.

Everyone knows that cinema was born in the laboratory of scientists and raised in the accounting office of capitalists. Although it has only been 45 years since its birth, its gestation period was very long, with the first signs appearing as early as 100 years ago.

In 1833, in the 1830s of the 19th century, it appeared on the market in the form of a toy. It first became popular in England, and ten years later, in 1845, it slowly spread to the United States. This toy was called the "Wheel of Life."

It is said that after the "Wheel of Life" was brought to the United States, it enchanted the Americans, and everyone became interested in it, which aroused the research of general scientists on it. The result was the emergence of several imitations such as "Motorscope," "Vitascope," and "Zoatrope."

Based on the improvement and experimentation of these immature machines, Sellers invented a "Kinematoscop" on February 5, 1861. This is the "grandmother of cinema."

On May 14, 1893, Thomas A. Edison invented the "Kinetoscope," which was truly regarded as the "mother of cinema" because it was closer to modern film machinery.

The era when Edison invented the "Kinetoscope" happened to coincide with the "World's Fair" being held in Chicago, and people watched the invention of the great scientist Edison with amazement.

After returning to the United States from Chicago, Edison took the opportunity to live in his hometown for a few days, and then returned to the laboratory where they were studying the invention of cinema.

On the morning of October 6, 1894, Edison had just entered the laboratory when he received a shocking report. This report not only pleased Edison, but also made everyone in the laboratory happy. Because the result of this report was: the experiment of shadow movement was successful.

That night, Edison excitedly gathered the neighbors in the vicinity, without telling them beforehand why he had invited them, and after inviting them into the fifth room, he showed a movie on a white cloth. It was a segment of a dance by a girl named Anna Belle. When the people present saw Anna Belle's dance movements on the white cloth, they were all pleasantly surprised. In this way, October 6, 1894, was designated by them as "the birthday of cinema."

New Film Introduction

### Juarez (Continued)

— Enterprise

The director's treatment of this historical epic is very meticulous in delineating the two characters, Juarez and Maximilian. For example, Juarez's appearance is shot from the back, and all the shots of Juarez's appearance give the audience a serious feeling, which shows his respect for this historical great man. As for Maximilian, when he went to Mexico, he was told in a few simple scenes that Mexico's beautiful mountains and rivers had been ravaged by invaders, and Juarez's letter pointed out that he was being used. Later, under the leadership of General Baron, he felt the sorrow of being a puppet. The director's description in this regard is extremely delicate.

The two climaxes of Juarez going alone to see Udinan, and the final victory and Maximilian's execution are both tense and moving. (1) Juarez's carriage; sentry reports; the people follow the carriage; Juarez walks face to face in the middle of the firing squad; Udinan stands up after drinking, ... He divides the characters of justice and rebellion very clearly, and the emotional atmosphere is also strong. (2) After Maximilian was arrested, ambassadors from various countries asked for a pardon, but Juarez refused. In prison, the director uses the black shadow of a horse and the sound of a pendulum to transform into Juarez's heartfelt pain. After Maximilian's death, Juarez said in front of his body: "Please forgive me!" The receding lens followed until the end of the play, filled with a strong, desolate atmosphere.

In short, the characters in "Juarez" seem to be jumping in front of us, and the excellent acting skills of the actors and the technical success are all worth recommending to the audience in Shanghai as a great film. (End)

### Love

— Xiao Tian

A said, "If you want to find a partner for love, you should go to the ballroom."

B said, "If you can find a partner for love in the ballroom, then you can also find a pure and tranquil Bodhisattva in the stock exchange. The black eyes of the dancers only recognize silver dollars, so how can you talk about love? " It is unknown which of the two is right, let me (44) explain the meaning of the two words "love" and tell you whether it is right or wrong, please correct me.

The word "love" means that the heart receives it. It must be that the heart has a feeling, and love arises spontaneously. This is simple and self-centered. For example, if I say that I love someone or something, no matter who it is, the person or thing that is loved has no right to forbid me to love it. To love is to love, and not to love is not to love. Isn't it very simple and free? But human nature will never just love and be done with it, they must further want to continue to feel, and even want to possess. If you happen to see a cute thing, you love it, you will definitely go back to admire it, and even buy it back and take it as your own. Accordingly, you can imagine that if you fall in love with a person, you will definitely not just love and be done with it, you must go further, even further, and even want to take it as your own. But people are not things after all. If you move a thing from someone else's hand, you can be considered to have possessed it, but people are not that simple. If you possess the shell, without possessing the heart inside the shell, it will show you a terrible...word.

The word "affection" requires reciprocity. I love her, but she doesn't love me, and the condition of love is not established. But from a self-centered perspective, the condition of love is established. So there is only a condition of love between people and things, and there can only be a condition of love between people. This condition of love must be that I love her and she loves me to be considered established. But this...does not stipulate what I must love about her and what she must love about me for the condition of love to be considered established. So generally speaking, in the ballroom, most of the dance guests love the dancers' beauty, and the dancers love the dance guests' money. Since both sides love each other, how can you say that the condition of love is not established? Based on this principle, A's statement cannot be said to be without reason. But to go further, what if the beauty fades? What if the money runs out? In fact, this is needless to say. Since the purpose of love no longer exists, the condition of love will of course disappear. Try flipping through the daily newspapers, which day doesn't have this kind of news? B's statement can be said to have been made in view of this.

I say that the elements of love are definitely not only composed of beauty and money. Even if they are, they are superficial and cannot be maintained for long. Are gold and beauty the only needs in life? So if you want to talk about true love, you have to talk about being able to understand each other's emotions and meet each other's needs. The ancients said, "To die without regret to have found a confidant," but how many people can understand this meaning?

### Extramural Notes: A Proposal for Shanghai to Establish a Theater for the Joint Performance of Kunqu, Qinqiang, Pihuang

— Xu Yun

Once this plan was settled, performances were given daily. One day, due to extraordinarily cold weather, the audience was even more sparse. After paying for lighting, donations, and other expenses, the remaining amount was insufficient to even provide thin porridge for the entire troupe. Naturally, the one yuan grooming fee for Shichang could not be paid. The next day, when they were scheduled to perform again, this fellow performer went on strike and did not show up. Shichang sat backstage waiting for a long time, and the performance on the stage was nearing its end, but the person still had not arrived. At this point, the backstage martial artists were filled with public indignation. They all said, "We, the actors who perform a whole act alone, still can't receive even one yuan a day. He is merely attending to the lead actors, yet no matter how difficult it is, we have to pay him one yuan first every day for him to work (gan huo, meaning to do things). Yesterday, because the income was too low, we didn't give him money, and today he doesn't care about righteousness at all and refuses to come to work. In that case, let's beat him up and then disband!" At that time, I heard about this situation in Beijing and felt that these people were truly too pitiful. They are all performers, so why are the famous actors of the Pihuang opera so luxurious and extravagant, while the Kunqu opera performers are so poor that they are about to disband entirely for the sake of one yuan? Isn't this too unfair? Furthermore, Hou Yongkui's "Lin Chong Flees by Night" (Wang Yiyou is already dead) is, without doubt, several times better than Li Wanchun's performance. The "Strange Tiger Assassination" and "Double Meeting" by Han Shichang and Ma Xianglin are also not necessarily weaker than the Four Great Dan of Pihuang opera. Moreover, these people have not gained their skill in a short period of three to five years; they have suffered for many years, and can’t even eat their fill of thin porridge. Yet, they see the newly trained disciples of the Pihuang opera going south and earning large sums of silver, three or five thousand dollars, which cannot help but make them feel disheartened and greatly aggrieved. I fear that they will slowly change careers and seek other opportunities, and the Kunqi opera troupes in the North, which are barely surviving, will disappear from the singing stage and become a forgotten melody.
