### Japanese Troops Land Near Beihai; Chinese Defense Forces Inflict Heavy Blows, Annihilating Several Japanese Units; Chinese Troops in Southwestern Shanxi Achieve Consecutive Victories, Recapturing Villages

Hong Kong: This morning, the 15th, taking advantage of inclement weather, Japanese troops launched a large-scale landing near Beihai, apparently with the aim of invading Yongning. Local garrison troops are bravely resisting, and the battle is ongoing. (15th Special Dispatch)

Hong Kong: This morning, Japanese sources here officially announced that Japanese troops landed near Beihai in Guangdong Province this morning, attempting to seize the lifeline connecting Chongqing and French Indochina in order to cut it off. According to news from Macau, the Japanese troops in Beihai landed at 9:00 AM today. It is said that the Japanese army and navy landed without encountering resistance from the Chinese army. The Japanese landing site was Longmen, 90 kilometers across the sea from Beihai. (15th United Press Dispatch)

Guilin: At 6:05 AM this morning, twelve Japanese warships shelled Qisha in Fangcheng. Five minutes later, more than forty Japanese warships were added, continuing to bombard the coast, and several Japanese aircraft made low-flying strafing runs, seemingly attempting to land. At 8:00 AM, six Japanese warships with three smokestacks appeared off the coast of Guantou Ridge near Beihai, intensively shelling the shore and releasing smoke screens. (15th Telegram)

Tokyo: Today, a spokesman for the Naval Ministry declared that Japan's military operations in Beihai are aimed at intensifying the blockade of the South China coast. After the fall of Beihai, all Chinese seaports will fall into Japanese hands. (15th Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing: The authorities here are currently awaiting an official report from the Guilin Southwestern Theater regarding the news of the Japanese landing in Beihai. It is said that this was expected, as Chongqing has received news in the past few days that Japanese naval, land, and air forces have concentrated on the Guangxi coast. According to intelligence received by the Chinese authorities here, Japanese troops have concentrated 50 aircraft on Hainan Island and 24 on Weizhou Island. The main force of the Japanese Fourth Fleet is reportedly concentrated near Hainan Island. A total of more than 60 Japanese warships and transport ships have gathered near Beihai. According to the Chinese military authorities here, they do not feel troubled by the Japanese landing in Beihai, as they have long been prepared for it. It is now believed that the Japanese army, through aerial and ground bombardment, may be able to occupy Beihai without much difficulty, but it will be extremely difficult for the Japanese to invade the interior from Beihai, as all the roads in the area have been thoroughly destroyed. Moreover, the people's organizations in Guangxi Province are as famous as its army, and they will certainly put up a strong resistance to any Japanese attempt to invade the province. (15th Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo: According to a communiqué issued today by the Japanese General Headquarters, Japanese troops, under the cover of Japanese warships, landed near Beihai this morning. According to a Japanese dispatch from Hong Kong, Beihai has been occupied by Japanese troops, but official confirmation of this news has not yet been received. According to the communiqué issued by the General Headquarters, elite Japanese naval and land forces, in close cooperation, braved the adverse weather this morning and suddenly landed near Beihai in Tokyo Bay and are now advancing inland. The Army Department of the General Headquarters also issued a communiqué stating that elite army troops, in close cooperation with the navy, landed near Beihai at 6:00 AM today and immediately began to advance. In the past few days, the weather near Beihai has been bad, with strong winds and big waves. This morning, the wind speed reached 18 meters per second. According to a communiqué issued by the Naval Department of the General Headquarters, the fleet led by Vice Admiral Takasu, commander of the South China Naval Fleet, escorted army transport ships to the waters near Beihai before dawn today. Under the cover of naval gunfire, the army immediately began landing and is currently advancing inland. Today, the wind is strong and the waves are high, but all Japanese troops are in good spirits. (15th Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing: According to Chinese military sources today, the Chinese coastal defense forces in Qinzhou Bay have annihilated several Japanese units that landed. Under the fierce bombardment of the Japanese navy and air force, they are putting up extremely strong resistance against the Japanese troops, who are now attempting to advance towards Beihai. However, the Chinese troops in Beihai are prepared to defend the area with all their might. According to a Chinese military spokesman, if the Japanese troops can advance further, they will encounter even stronger resistance. Furthermore, the news of the Japanese landing near Beihai was not surprising, as it is generally believed here that the Japanese goal in landing in Beihai is nothing more than (1) to disrupt the constructive atmosphere of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and (2) to create news of victory in order to recover their face after their great defeat in northern Hunan. It was also said that the Japanese could have taken Beihai two years ago, but they did not take it at the time, and it is now at a great disadvantage to attack it, because China has strong defenses in that area. Therefore, it will be difficult for the Japanese to advance easily. For example, the Japanese have occupied Xiamen and Shantou for a long time, but they still cannot penetrate deeply. Therefore, if Japan wants to cut off the transportation route between Guangxi and Annam, it must adopt a large-scale offensive, preparing to sacrifice a large part of its manpower and resources, before there is any hope. According to Chinese sources, the shortest distance from Beihai to the Guangxi-Vietnam Highway is 140 kilometers, and from Xisha (transliteration), 75 kilometers west of Beihai, to the highway is 120 kilometers. There are highways from Beihai and Xisha to Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Province, so the Japanese are obviously aiming to attack Nanning, but the Japanese wish will definitely not be fulfilled, because since the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, the Chinese side has long expected the Japanese to take this action. However, the Guangxi Muslims, under the leadership of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, believe that the defenses there are extremely strong and there is nothing to worry about. According to Chinese sources, there are currently 40 Japanese warships and one aircraft carrier anchored in Qinzhou Bay. At around 6:00 AM this morning, they first shelled Xisha (transliteration) at the tip of the peninsula and the surrounding villages and towns and the north, and then released a large amount of smoke screens and landed with 20 speedboats. The Chinese coastal defense forces also returned fire and resisted with all their might, wiping out several landing Japanese units. Later, the Japanese navy and air force frequently covered the Japanese troops, who were able to land. The Japanese landing this time benefited from its air force, as Japan, in addition to relying on the aircraft carrier anchored there as a base, also has a newly built airfield on Weizhou Island. At the same time, the Japanese navy concentrated there also accounts for one-third of the fleet in China. Furthermore, the recent Japanese action of forcing down a British Imperial Airways airliner on Weizhou Island was obviously a means by which the Japanese prepared to attack the mainland there, fearing that it would be discovered. (15th United Press Dispatch)

Sihui: Japanese warships shelled Qisha (southeast of Fangcheng) heavily. At around 3:00 PM, twelve Japanese boats full of Japanese soldiers landed near Longmen and are now engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. (15th Telegram)

Guilin: Several Japanese aircraft flew over Hepu, Qin County, San Niang Bay, Di Jiao, Sha Jiao, and Beihai on the 13th to reconnoiter. (14th Telegram)

Xingji: A person from Taiyuan said that the Japanese army in southeastern Shanxi suffered another heavy blow, with a total of more than 10,000 casualties. Lieutenant General Joazuka, the commander of the Japanese army, recently telegraphed Nanking Japanese Commander-in-Chief Nishio for assistance in an attempt to retaliate. Division Commander Ushijima was indeed seriously wounded by the Chinese army near Changzhi and returned to his country for recuperation last month. (15th)

Xingji: Japanese troops besieged in Xiangning City launched a counterattack towards Fujia Village on the 13th and were defeated by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 14th, they launched a full-scale attack to the north, attempting to break through one point of the Chinese siege line. A bloody battle unfolded in the Pingyuan Village area, ten miles north of Xiangning City. Chinese officers and soldiers fought bravely, heavily damaging the Japanese army. From morning until about 2:00 PM, although the Japanese fought hard and repeatedly released poison gas to cover their advance, they were completely defeated by the Chinese army and retreated south in disarray. When they reached the outskirts of Xiangning, they were intercepted by the Chinese army. The remnants of the Japanese army were unable to enter the city and fled in panic towards the southern mountains. At 6:40 PM, the Chinese army successfully recaptured Xiangning City and sent teams to pursue the retreating Japanese army and continue to search. (15th Telegram)

Shaanzhou: After the Chinese army's consecutive days of sweeping operations against the Japanese army in the area north of Hongtun Road and west of Baijin Road in southeastern Shanxi, the remnants of the Japanese army fled in confusion and were ambushed by the Chinese army along the way, suffering heavy casualties. At the moment, there is no trace of the Japanese in the area. (15th Telegram)

Xingji: More than 1,000 Japanese troops from Taigu invaded southward on the 9th, reaching Baibi, north of Huixian, and were intercepted by the Chinese army. On the same day, more than 600 Japanese troops from Laiyuan also invaded Huixian from the east and fought against a certain Chinese unit. In the evening, the Japanese army fled to the East and West Xingzhuang, south of Huixian. The Chinese army launched a surprise attack under the cover of night, and the stalemate lasted until dawn on the 11th, when the Japanese attempted to break through to the west. After being attacked from the front and rear by the Chinese army, they returned to the old city of Dongxi Qingxiu, south of Dongxi Xingzhuang. More than 200 Japanese troops were urgently dispatched to reinforce, but were ambushed and defeated by the Chinese army. At the moment, the Chinese army is continuing to encircle and annihilate the remnants of the Japanese army. (14th Telegram)

### The Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Holds Its Third Meeting; Kong Xiangxi and Others Report on the Financial and Economic Situation; the Kuomintang and the Communist Party Agree on Wartime Plans

Chongqing: The Sixth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held its third meeting on the 15th. President Chiang presided over the meeting. After announcing the minutes of the second meeting, various reports were given, including reports by Committee Members Zhang Ji and Ma Chaojun on the comforting of troops at the front, a report by Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi on finance, and a report by Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao on the economy. After several hours of reports by various officials, the meeting adjourned. (15th Telegram)

Chongqing: According to reliable sources today, the issue of relations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will not be mentioned at this Sixth Plenary Session, and the Japanese propaganda about friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will be denied. It is said that there are no serious problems between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the two parties have the same views on all major wartime plans. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party also hold the same views on the issue of constitutionalism. This can be seen in the recent resolutions of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and in President Chiang's speech on Monday. There is also no question that the two parties agree to cooperate until the end of the Sino-Japanese War. Kuomintang authorities told a reporter from the Associated Press that the main content of this Sixth Plenary Session will be to review the work achievements of the past nine months, the government's policies and the direction of the War of Resistance, and that there will be no changes in government personnel. At yesterday's meeting, Executive Yuan President and Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, and Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin gave reports on administration, diplomacy, and military affairs, respectively. Dai Jitao of the Examination Yuan and others were elected yesterday as chairmen of the declaration drafting committee. (15th Associated Press Dispatch)

Editorial

### The Dead End of Japan's Eagerness to End the War Against China

Recent public opinion in Japan and the expressions of officials have frankly stated their eagerness to end the war against China. Japan has been invading China for two years and four months. Apart from plundering some resources in the militarily occupied areas, destroying China's order and laws, and spreading evils such as opium and gambling, it has gained nothing. However, the consumption of huge amounts of manpower, material resources, and financial resources has already shaken the foundation of its domestic economy and society. Originally, the Japanese economy had only entered the stage of modern capitalism, and due to natural limitations, it could only focus on the development of light industry, completely relying on the maintenance of foreign trade. However, in this Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese government's so-called wartime measures fundamentally blocked this normal economic activity. Strict control of foreign trade only caused the amount of imports and exports to decrease sharply, causing the production capacity of various industries to decline again and again. Although subsidy policies, commodity linkage systems, and improved trade administrative agencies were adopted to try to revitalize export trade and restore industrial activity through so-called rationing and control, the consumption of the war of aggression, which was beyond its capabilities, could not be remedied by human efforts. For example, recently the Japanese claimed that foreign trade had improved, believing that the control policy had been effective. In fact, Japanese trade has never improved. The increase in the amount of imports and exports and the conversion of the trade balance to a deficit are due to Japanese merchants dumping a large number of commodities in the exclusive military occupation areas and then plundering various commodities in the military occupation areas, exchanging them for large amounts of military currency and sending them to their home country. This is the truth of the so-called improvement. Various important commodities that it has always regarded as the most important markets in Europe, the United States, and Southeast Asia, and which it boasts are the best in the world, are all continuing to decline. After the outbreak of the European war, Japan was not only isolated diplomatically, but also in an even worse economic situation. It is naturally very difficult to maintain trade with Europe and Southeast Asia as it did in the past, and the United States' gradual retaliatory actions against its so-called New Order in East Asia are a fatal blow to the Japanese economy. How much economic strength can it have to support a long-term war and maintain domestic social stability in the absence of foreign aid? I am afraid that no one in Japan with any sense of awareness does not understand this. The East Daily recently stated that Elder Saionji is currently worried about the domestic and international situation in Japan, which is an example. Then the recent propaganda to end the war against China is the anxious cry and internal demand of the Japanese people. As for Japan's attempt to develop foreign trade after the end of the war, taking advantage of the opportunity of the European war, this is only an incidental hope.

China and Japan are adjacent to each other, and economically, there is a close relationship of mutual benefit and reliance between them. If Japan had not resorted to violence, there would have been a possibility of equal cooperation. Unfortunately, Japan妄想destroyed China and monopolized the Far East, which led to today's great mistake. Japan only has some people with foresight who are worried about this great mistake, but have not thoroughly awakened to it. Therefore, it is still渺茫when they will be able to achieve their hope of ending the war! It is not China that is dragging it down. China has always been passively resisting the war. Although it has suffered from the tea毒of Japan and sacrificed countless lives and properties, the people are惨痛 and angry, and are united in their hatred of the enemy, but they have no demands on Japan. Recently, President Chiang stated in his address at the Sixth Plenary Session that China's national policy has always maintained four principles: (1) Opposing Japanese aggression to protect the integrity of sovereignty, territory, and administration; (2) Abiding by international conventions; (3) Not participating in anti-communist agreements; and (4) Complete independence and autonomy in diplomacy. This is peaceful, this is fair; whether it is about sentiment or reason, it is valid for the whole world; if Japan is awakened, if Japan hopes to end the war, it should accept these four principles.

Unfortunately, Japan only has some people with foresight who only know how to worry but never awaken; it thinks that the "New Order" can deceive international recognition, and the "New Regime" can deceive China into peace; deceive again and again, then it can deceive into annexing China and monopolizing the Far East; in fact, people with conscience and conscience, who would be ambiguous! For example, regarding the so-called New Order, the US Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grew, very婉转ly explained that he would not be deceived, which is clear evidence. However, Japan still喃喃自语about this, 刺刺不休. We think that if the understanding is insufficient, or even goes astray, it is regrettable, and it can be saved. If it has been discovered that it cannot deceive people, but it is still 大吹大擂, it is deceiving itself. If it is deceiving itself and it doesn't matter, there is still something to say; now Japan is economically and militarily unable to maintain its policy of aggression, and it has already reached a state of 可忧可虑, this kind of deceiving oneself is 耽误 itself! If it delays itself and eats its own fruit, it is not worthy of pity. But we hope that Japan will not wait until it is too late to regret

### British and French Troops Withdraw from North China; US Policy Unaffected; US State Department Denies Protecting British Interests on Behalf of Britain

Washington: The State Department here today specifically denied rumors that after the British government decided to withdraw British troops from North China, it asked the United States to come forward to protect British interests in China, and said that the United States' position in the Far East is not affected by the British and French troop withdrawal actions. (15th Associated Press Dispatch)

London: Official sources here have resolutely denied rumors that Britain will withdraw its troops from Shanghai, calling them unfounded. In addition, there are claims that the Japanese army in Tianjin has taken even stricter measures against the British Concession, and that coal supply has reportedly been cut off, which cannot be confirmed here at present. (15th Havas Dispatch)

Tianjin: This morning, the British and French troops stationed in Tianjin have not yet begun to withdraw. Foreigners are deeply stimulated by the British and French reduction of troops, while the Japanese army is still stationed opposite the British and French concessions. (15th Associated Press Dispatch)

Tianjin: Sources that have always been reliable stated today that, according to the plan to withdraw most of the British troops stationed in China, a squadron of the British troops stationed in Shanghai, the East Surrey Regiment, will be transferred to Tianjin to replace the Royal Welch Fusiliers. A platoon of the East Surrey will be transferred to Beijing to protect British interests. The military authorities here refused to confirm or deny this. Regarding the news that a company of the East Surrey Regiment is coming to Tianjin, they refused to comment. When the Royal Welch Fusiliers will leave Tianjin, the French troops preparing to withdraw have been ordered to sail elsewhere within three weeks. (15th Associated Press Dispatch)

Washington: Regarding Britain's withdrawal of troops from North China, the Washington Post here believes that it cannot be viewed as a common occurrence, but it would be too much to say that this action will have a major impact. Although Britain's withdrawal of its troops from North China will create new problems, Japan also has its own problems. First, the Soviet Union has always been Japan's hidden danger, and second, Japan's war in China is also in an unfavorable state. Because of the above reasons, both Japan and Britain are trying to maintain friendly relations. According to Simmons, a diplomatic correspondent for the American Howard newspaper chain, after Britain withdraws its troops from North China, the situation in the Far East may change rapidly, and American interests may be affected by the European War more directly and to a greater extent. Regarding the Netherlands' intention to ask the United States to protect its interests in the Far East, Simmons believes that the United States does not understand and cannot undertake this task, and is unwilling to bear this task, because this action is very different from the US national policy. (15th Associated Press Dispatch)

Chongqing: The "English Chu Pao," the mouthpiece of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published an article yesterday expressing its deep fear that the British government's decision to withdraw troops from North China means that Britain intends to sell out China as the European War drags on. The newspaper pointed out that the news of the British troop withdrawal was met with great satisfaction by Japan, and hoped that the intensification of Japan's actions against China would force Britain to abandon its position in the Far East. In China, it will inevitably cause disappointment. The explanation given by the British side that the troop withdrawal is necessary for the European War is considered difficult to believe, especially the "maintenance of troops in necessary locations," is even more doubtful. In the past, the entire British garrison stationed in North China could not prevent the British expatriates in Tianjin from being humiliated again and again. Now, with only one team and one battalion remaining, hoping to protect the lives and property of expatriates is nothing short of self-deception. Regardless of whether this action represents another concession by Britain to Japan, China cannot but worry about Britain's Far East policy. (15th Haitong Dispatch)

### Britain's Far East Policy Has Not Changed; Butler Answers Questions in the House of Commons

London: At the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Labour MP Baker referred to Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent remarks to a reporter from a Japanese newspaper and asked whether some of the words in this statement could be misunderstood as Britain having changed its attitude towards the Far East. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler immediately replied, "The last paragraph of the statement involves the Far East. The original text is hereby sent to the members of the committee for review. The previous statement on the Far East policy has also been included in the Prime Minister's statement, so that it can be seen that our country's Far East policy has not changed. In addition, the speech recently delivered by US Ambassador to Japan Grew in Tokyo has been largely published. Foreign Secretary Halifax intends to ask Mr. Baker to review it. The British government is not in a position to issue a formal statement at this time." (15th Havas Dispatch)

### Anglo-Japanese Negotiations on the Tianjin Incident Remain Stalled

London: The diplomatic correspondent of The Times said that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin Incident are still stalled, and the two sides are only exchanging unofficial opinions that cannot bind the two governments. As for the silver stored in the British bank in Tianjin, the British government is prepared to accept a solution that can be agreed to by the Chinese National Government, but it is not prepared to take China's assets without the consent and permission of the owner to dispose of them. (15th Reuters Dispatch)

### The Japanese Kwantung Army Remains Suspicious of the Soviet Union; Border Demarcation Issues Are Being Delayed

Changchun: The Japanese and Manchukuo authorities here are now closely observing the progress in Europe, especially the situation related to the Soviet Union. Newspapers are also publishing news about the Soviet-Finnish negotiations and the recent situation in the Balkans in important positions. Although the Soviet Union is preoccupied with matters in the West and will not repeat the Nomonhan or Zhanggufeng incidents, the military authorities here still maintain a cautious wait-and-see attitude. The Kwantung Army remains suspicious of the Soviet Union, so it is always preparing to deal with any military action by Outer Mongolia or the Soviet Union. According to the military authorities here, there is still no possibility of understanding with the Soviet Union as recently reported in the newspapers, because Japan has long wanted to demarcate the borders between "Manchukuo" and the Soviet Union and between "Manchukuo" and Mongolia, and has done a lot of work on surveying the borders, but the Soviet side has taken no action and is only delaying. According to the Japanese, apart from the sea, the border of "Manchukuo" from the southern end of Outer Mongolia to the Sea of Japan is the border between Japan and the Soviet Union, not just the border between "Manchukuo" and Mongolia. The Japanese military authorities often ask themselves whether the Zhanggufeng and Nomonhan incidents and the Soviet Union's supply of arms to the rebels in the northern provinces of "Manchukuo" will continue to occur. The resentment of the Japanese military when Germany and the Soviet Union signed the non-aggression pact has not yet subsided. According to common speculation, this resentment will not dissipate for a while. (15th Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo: Lieutenant General Umezu, Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army and Japanese Ambassador to "Manchukuo," recently arrived in Tokyo from Changchun and was granted an audience with the Emperor of Japan at 10:30 this morning. Chief of the Army General Staff Prince Kan'in and Minister of War Junroku were in attendance. Umezu reported on the situation in "Manchukuo." In the afternoon, Umezu reported on the same matter to the Army Ministry and the General Staff. (15th Reuters Dispatch)

Rome: Newspapers here recently carried news from Berlin that the general public in the Soviet Union is expecting that the Soviet Union and Japan can enhance their relations and hope that the two sides will quickly approach each other. There is also talk that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will visit Tokyo next spring. (14th Havas Dispatch)

Paris: Diplomatic circles here recently said that the Soviet Union, in the past few years, has been working hard to woo Japan to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. Now, it has changed its course and is working to mediate between Japan and the Soviet Union. The initial news about the mutual approach between Japan and the Soviet Union came from Berlin, which can be seen. In fact, the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union has not progressed much, as the German spokesman said. Those in Japan who are in favor of reconciliation with the Soviet Union are the ones who previously advocated that the Anti-Comintern Pact of the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy be changed into a military alliance treaty. It can be seen that the reason why they suddenly changed their attitude towards the Soviet Union is still because they sympathize with Germany and listen to Germany's suggestions. According to well-informed sources, Japan and the Soviet Union are indeed conducting negotiations, hoping to resolve various county cases and thereby establish a new foundation for the relationship between the two sides. However, the main goal of the Japanese side is to get the Soviet Union to stop aiding China. In the view of foreign observers, there is no sign at the moment that the Soviet Union is prepared to abandon its great policy towards China. (14th Havas Dispatch)

### Japanese Foreign Minister Meets Soviet Ambassador to Discuss Pending Issues

Tokyo – Foreign Minister Nomura met with Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin at the Foreign Ministry at 3:30 PM on the 15th. He stated his intention to promptly begin discussions regarding the revision of the temporary Japan-Soviet fisheries treaty and exchanged opinions on various pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union. The meeting lasted from 3:50 to 4:25 PM. Furthermore, regarding the issues of detained vessels, the confirmation of rights to oil in northern Sakhalin, and North Pacific fisheries between Japan and the Soviet Union, Ambassador Togo in Moscow and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov are conducting separate consultations. The majority of the detained vessel issue has already been resolved. It has been decided to convene a commission soon to specifically discuss the demarcation of the Manchurian-Mongolian border. (15th, Dōmei News)

Tokyo – A Foreign Ministry spokesperson, in response to a question from a foreign journalist this morning, stated that Japan is indeed pursuing a good-neighbor policy towards the Soviet Union, as advocated by President Roosevelt. Therefore, we do not understand why the American people hold feelings of unease and suspicion regarding the improvement of Japan-Soviet relations, as expressed in the New York dispatch reported in today's newspapers. Japan desires to establish friendly relations with its neighbor, the Soviet Union, naturally. We sincerely hope that the Soviet Union will reciprocate Japan's good-neighbor policy. (15th, Reuters)

### Japanese Army Promotes Rice Conservation; One Rice-Free Day Per Month

Tokyo – The Army Ministry and the General Staff held their first "Rice-Free Day" today to promote a national rice conservation movement. Minister of the Army Shunroku and 1,500 other officers and employees ate bread and pasta instead of rice for lunch. It has since been decided that every Wednesday will be a "Rice-Free Day." Government agencies, including divisional headquarters, will follow suit. An Army Ministry spokesperson said today that the shortage of rice in Japan is due to poor harvests in Korea and western Japan. If the entire nation can forgo eating rice for one day each month, it will not be difficult to cope with this shortage. (15th, Reuters)

### Sun Fo Discusses Sino-Soviet Relations in British House of Commons; Sir Leith-Ross to Host Dinner

London – Sun Fo, President of the Legislative Yuan of China, delivered an interesting speech to the China Committee of the House of Commons last night. The committee members listened intently and asked many questions regarding Sino-Soviet relations. Sun Fo is scheduled to return to Paris on Friday. While residing at the Chinese Embassy here, Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi hosted a series of tea parties, allowing Sun Fo to meet with representatives of the Conservative, Liberal, and Labour parties, as well as journalists from major newspapers. On Sunday, Sun Fo had a lengthy conversation with British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill and gained a very satisfactory impression of the British government's attitude towards China. Sun Fo also had a long discussion with Sir Alexander Cadogan, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and former British Ambassador to China. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's chief economic advisor who led a financial mission to China in 1935, will host a dinner on Thursday to introduce Sun Fo to President of the Board of Trade Stanley. The Chinese community in London is quite pleased with the results of Sun Fo's visit and believes that it will have a particularly good influence at a time when Japanese propaganda is very active.

### Resignation Wave in Indian Congress Party Cabinet

Shillong, India – The Assam Congress Party coalition cabinet resigned today. This is the last resignation among the eight Congress Party cabinets. The reason is dissatisfaction with the British policy towards India outlined in the recent White Paper presented by the Viceroy of India. (15th, Reuters)

### Philippines' Future: Filipinos to Decide; Quezon Delivers Speech

Manila – Today is the fourth anniversary of the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. President Quezon, in a speech delivered during a military parade, stated, in essence, that the future of the Philippines will be entirely determined by Filipinos themselves. Quezon avoided talking about the issue of independence. Quezon also argued that because the retail business in the Philippines is entirely controlled by Chinese, Japanese, and Americans, the retail business should be Filipinized. However, Quezon also stated that Filipinization does not mean depriving foreigners of businesses already established in the Philippines, but only that Filipinos should also develop the retail business on the island. Vice President Osmena also gave a speech, stating, "Our political activities to fight for freedom have ended. The major issue we should pay attention to from now on is economic stability, which is a necessary condition for independence." Today, 11,000 Philippine Army soldiers, 5,000 military academy students, and 30,000 spectators celebrated the fourth anniversary of Philippine autonomy. (15th, United Press)

### Diplomatic Secrets Continue to Be Exposed in a London Lawsuit; Lord Rothermere Once Offered Advice to Hitler

London – During the continuing trial in the High Court of Princess Hohenlohe's lawsuit against British press magnate Lord Rothermere for breach of contract, more interesting facts about negotiations with Hitler were revealed. The plaintiff's lawyer, Beyfus, asked the Earl, showing him an unpublished letter, "Did you not make a suggestion to Hitler in this letter, and if Hitler acted on this suggestion, would there not be a very violent reaction in Europe?" The Earl did not answer. Beyfus asked again and again. The Earl then said, "I don't think so." Beyfus continued, "In 1938, the Earl interfered in European affairs as he had done before, and on a larger scale." The Earl replied, "I do not admit this. At that time, I was only trying to avert war between the two peoples." The Earl's son, Harmesworth, who succeeded his father as chairman of the company that owns the Daily Mail and other newspapers, testified that he only knew the Princess as a friend of his father and did not know that she was an employee until only a month ago. The defendant's lawyer, Travers, began the Earl's concluding argument, saying that the Princess had brought a suit she knew to be dishonest, hoping to put pressure on the Earl to settle the case privately rather than disclose certain confidential letters. In fact, these letters would not harm the Earl's reputation, but merely contained information on confidential negotiations with the people of another country on a confidential matter. The Earl was deeply dissatisfied with the Princess's involvement of confidential matters in court. The Princess originally attempted to extort Harmesworth by threatening to disclose letters obtained from his father. The plaintiff's lawyer, Beyfus, argued that the Princess had to keep them, and it was incredible that the Earl did not know that the Princess had copies. The judge said that the letters from Hitler did not contain anything disreputable or contradict his statements at the time, and neither did the letters from Lord Rothermere. The case was adjourned for further hearing. (14th, Reuters)

London – In the case of Princess Hohenlohe's lawsuit against Lord Rothermere for breach of contract, Justice de Yu of the High Court ruled in favor of Lord Rothermere today, on the grounds that Lord Rothermere had not stipulated that he had to guarantee the Princess's political reputation or pay her £5,000 per year.

### German Government Replies to Dutch and Belgian Peace Mediation with Sympathy; Declares It Will Not Be Coerced by Force; Expresses Difficulty Accepting British and French Conditions

Berlin – The Belgian and Dutch ministers to Germany visited the German Foreign Ministry yesterday. Officials in charge of the Foreign Ministry informed the two ministers of the content of Germany's reply to the peace appeal of the two countries. It is understood that the German reply will be officially delivered to the Kings of Belgium and the Netherlands in The Hague and Brussels this morning. (15th, Haitian Press)

The Hague – The "Electricity News" here recently reported that German leader Hitler's reply to the notes of the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands has been sent to the two governments through diplomatic channels. The content expresses sympathy for the two heads of state's attempt to mediate peace, but declares that Germany will find it difficult to accept the conditions put forward by Britain and France. The actions of Britain and France have completely closed the door to a peaceful solution. If they wish to strive for peace, they only need to issue a declaration stating that they are happy to end the war and are prepared to negotiate peace terms. However, under the current circumstances, if Germany were to take action to restore peace, it would inevitably be misunderstood as succumbing to force, which Germany would not be happy to do. In addition, German political figures are extremely indignant at Britain and France's demand for the restoration of the complete sovereignty and freedom of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.

### Germany Threatens to Attack Foreign Armed Merchant Ships; Will Treat Them the Same as Warships; Several British Ships Continue to Be Sunk

Berlin – A spokesman for the German Naval High Command met with foreign reporters yesterday afternoon to explain Germany's attitude towards foreign armed merchant ships, pointing out that according to international conventions, armed merchant ships should in principle be regarded as warships and treated the same as warships. A reporter asked, based on German newspaper reports, what treatment would be given to the "Mauretania," which is now in the port of New York and has been armed. The spokesman replied that the ship would be treated the same as a warship in the Atlantic. The reporter asked if the installation of cannons on the ship could be regarded as purely defensive measures. The spokesman replied that international law does not have such a stipulation, and that under normal circumstances, merchant ships and passenger liners have no reason to be attacked, nor is there any need to defend themselves. Therefore, the installation of cannons indicates an intention to attack. (15th, Haitian Press)

London – The British ship "Madeira" (8,000 tons) exploded in the North Sea last night and sank immediately. Two crew members were killed and twenty-two were injured. The captain and the remaining crew were rescued. (14th, Havas)

### British Air Force Takes Great Risks; Successful Reconnaissance Flights Over Germany; Takes Multiple Photos of Fortresses Deep Inside Territory

London – The British Air Force has taken hundreds of photos of German towns, harbors, and military destinations in recent weeks. British planes have penetrated more than 200 miles into German territory several times. Although they have encountered active resistance from German fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns, they have ultimately returned with photos. More than 100 of these photos show military targets in great detail and contain extremely important information. This was taken during a reconnaissance flight in good weather. Another time, photos were taken of 16 airfields and the fortified areas of Emden and Hamburg. The total distance of each flight rarely fell below 800 miles. Very few planes did not fly back safely. One British plane, when targeting an airfield during its reconnaissance flight, flew so low that it passed under two German bombers that were about to land at the airfield. Another time, a British plane flew so high that the crew had to rely on oxygen supply equipment to breathe. The British Air Force is responsible for this dangerous work, and it is easy to be attacked by the enemy and face the natural dangers of winter flight, so occasional losses are expected. One British plane was flying at a high altitude at a temperature of 20 degrees below zero. When it reached its destination and flew back, the fuselage was hit by anti-aircraft fire. The gunner was injured, and the lookout removed his parachute straps, life preserver, and coat, squeezed himself through a narrow gap in the frame to the gunner's seat, wrapped the injury, and comforted him until they flew out of German territory, then returned to his lookout seat and resumed his lookout duties. This lookout did not wear a coat in the freezing temperature throughout the flight back from Germany. Such brave behavior is to be seen in the Air Force. (15th, Reuters)

### German Planes Actively Operating; Reconnaissance Over Shetland Islands; Leaflets Distributed in Paris

London – A German reconnaissance plane was seen again in the skies over the Shetland Islands before dusk yesterday. This was the third time within 24 hours that a German plane had flown over the island. In the previous two attacks, the German planes dropped at least 12 bombs, estimated to weigh 500 pounds each. A seven-pound piece of shrapnel hit a small shed. Four bombs landed in the sea without causing damage. Four bombs fell less than a quarter of a mile from a school, and another four fell on a hilltop three miles away. (15th, Reuters)

Paris – It was rumored that a plane of unknown nationality flew over the city yesterday, dropping leaflets containing a speech by Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov. This has now been confirmed, and it is known that the leaflets were printed in Germany, indicating that the plane was German. (14th, Havas)

### British and French Finance and Economy Expand Cooperation Scope; Finance Ministers' Meeting Results in Complete Agreement

London – After two conversations between French Finance Minister Reynaud and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, Reynaud boarded a plane and returned to his country this afternoon. (15th, Havas)

London – The Treasury released a communiqué stating, "French Finance Minister Reynaud, at the invitation of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, arrived in London on the 13th of this month with a group of officials and held talks. Both sides agreed that the UK and France should continue to cooperate closely in economic and financial matters. A review of the current cooperation methods was carried out, and it was decided to maintain and expand their scope. Several issues of a general and technical nature were also discussed. The opinions were completely consistent. At the conclusion of the talks on the 14th, Finance Minister Reynaud suggested that opinions be exchanged frequently in the future to maintain continuous contact, and Chancellor Simon expressed his deep sympathy." (15th, Havas)

London – French Finance Minister Reynaud has arrived in London for a short stay and will discuss various financial and economic issues arising from the war with the British authorities. In a broadcast speech, Reynaud said, "Our big problem is to bravely cope with the needs of the war. France now needs more foreign exchange. At the beginning of the war, everyone had the greatest confidence that our country would win. Today, we still do. France has a clear and firm determination to join the war, so that this war can ensure that future wars will never happen again, and it is gratifying that the British people also have the desire to achieve true peace."

### German-Dutch Situation Eases; Rumor that US Ambassador Told Netherlands that It Will Provide Moral Support

Paris – Although the tension between Belgium and the Netherlands towards Germany has eased slightly, observations from the air have revealed that there have been no major changes in the concentration of German troops on the Belgian border. The general opinion here is that Hitler will repeatedly use tactics to keep small countries in a constant state of alarm. As for the reason for the current easing of the tense situation, Italian newspapers have cited four points: (1) the nature of Dutch Foreign Minister Kiel's broadcast speech on Sunday (Kiel's speech solemnly declared that recent military measures were not due to an increase in danger, but only for prevention); (2) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's meeting with the Belgian Ambassador in Berlin; (3) the German ambassador's visit to Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak; (4) the US Minister to The Hague's audience with the Queen of the Netherlands. It is rumored that the US Minister had an audience at the request of the Queen of the Netherlands. (13th, Reuters)

The Hague – Some newspapers here have expressed dissatisfaction with the government's military measures, which have caused nationwide panic. According to foreign observers, the reason for the Dutch government's unease is that Germany is mobilizing troops near the Dutch border and that the National Socialist Party is carrying out large-scale activities within the Netherlands. Domestic dynamics are easy to control, while German pressure from abroad naturally threatens the Netherlands. Residents who had previously fled to the capital from the border area have now returned to their hometowns. In addition, US Minister to the Netherlands Gordon paid a visit to Queen Wilhelmina on the 12th of this month. The content of the conversation has not been officially released, but according to well-informed sources, this matter is very important. Minister Gordon is said to have presented a letter from President Roosevelt to Queen Wilhelmina. From this, it can be seen that if the Netherlands is invaded or unreasonably oppressed, it will certainly receive active sympathy from the United States. The current easing of the situation is probably due to this. (14th, Havas)

### German Foreign Traffic Apparently Not Completely Severed; Difficult to Fill Holes in the British Blockade; Progress in German-Soviet Economic Talks

London – According to observations here, the British economic blockade of Germany has many defects. Although German ships at sea have been cleared by the British Navy, Germany's foreign lines of communication have apparently not been severed. The Netherlands, Belgium, and the Nordic countries are all loopholes in the British blockade. In addition, the Soviet Union and the Balkan countries can supply Germany with food, oil, manganese, livestock, and minerals, and Swedish iron seedlings can also be continuously exported to Germany. Recently, Germany sent a trade delegation to the Swedish capital to discuss ways to increase Swedish exports to Germany. In addition to its own economic assistance to Germany, the Soviet Union's trans-Eurasian Siberian Railway can also be used by Germany to import Manchurian soybeans, completely free from British control. According to diplomatic sources here, Soviet railways are broad-gauge, while German railways are narrow-gauge. However, Germany is rushing to build new vehicles to overcome this transportation obstacle, and the wheel disks can be arbitrarily enlarged and reduced. They can run on German railways and can also be forced to stay on Soviet railways without any hindrance. After these vehicles are completed, they can reach the border of Manchuria for Germany to transport soybeans. At the same time, Italy is also using its neutral position to conduct large-scale trade with Germany. Although the British authorities in Gibraltar also carry out the same inspections on Italian ships, due to the presence of a strong Italian navy in the Mediterranean, it is not possible to seek special concessions to achieve delay. This is also one of the loopholes in the blockade against Germany. (15th, United Press)

Berlin – According to Goering's mouthpiece, the "Aisen City National Daily," German-Soviet economic negotiations have now entered a new stage. Part of the German delegation negotiating in Moscow has returned home to participate in business discussions in Berlin. The rest are staying in Moscow, maintaining close contact with the Soviet government. Once the Berlin talks are over, all German representatives will return to Moscow to continue negotiations.

### Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Stall but Do Not Break Down; Finnish Delegation Returns Home for Instructions; Says Soviet Union Never Threatened

Helsinki – The Finnish delegation that held negotiations with the Soviet government in Moscow has returned here today. Finnish Finance Minister Tanner, one of the important delegates, told people after arriving here that the negotiations had been conducted cordially throughout, with no threats or ultimatums. The negotiations did not break down. (15th, Reuters)

London – Diplomatic sources here said that according to reliable sources, the Soviet Union does not want to conquer Finland by force, but rather to destroy the country's resistance through psychological warfare. In other words, Soviet troops should be constantly concentrated near the Finnish border, thereby taking a psychological offensive while waiting for Finland to weaken on its own. In addition, Soviet officials insist that Finland's decision to resist is purely due to encouragement from the United Kingdom and the United States. The Soviet diplomatic authorities are therefore likely to strive to urge the British government to advise Finland and the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula to take a more compromising attitude, while also requesting that Britain agree to greatly increase the amount of trade between the UK and the Soviet Union. It is worth noting that the British government submitted a list to the Soviet Union three weeks ago detailing the various goods that the UK could export to that country, but the Soviet government has not yet responded for some reason. (14th, Havas)

Helsinki – Since the government began raising 50 million Finnish marks in national defense bonds, it has only been a few days, and the amount of public subscriptions has already exceeded the predetermined amount. According to general estimates, the total amount of private subscriptions and voluntary donations is no less than 100 million marks. In addition, the government representative sent to the Soviet Union returned yesterday. Although the Soviet Union has issued news that Finnish morale has been greatly depressed as a result, in fact the people remain calm as usual and have full confidence in the future situation. Most of the citizens of the capital who had been ordered to evacuate have recently returned, and their calmness can be seen from this. (11th, Havas)

Helsinki – It was rumored that several Soviet planes had flown over the Finnish city of Viipuri, and one of them had been shot down by Finnish anti-aircraft guns. Responsible officials here recently denied this. (15th, Havas)

### Number of Soviet Troops Stationed in Lithuania Temporarily Limited to 20,000

### Pan-American Financial Conference: U.S. Representative Expresses Views

Guatemala City, Guatemala, America—The Pan-American Financial Conference held a plenary session yesterday. Representatives from nineteen countries attended. The U.S. chief representative, Gaston, immediately expressed his views, stating that the countries of North, Central, and South America should use the monetary agreement of England, France, and the United States as a blueprint to conclude a Pan-American financial agreement, establishing a foundation for regular cooperation among the finance ministries of the American countries. He said, "Our Secretary of the Treasury, Morgenthau, having observed the operation of the monetary agreement among England, France, and the United States, is very satisfied that the finance ministries of the signatory countries are in contact with each other daily. It is now time to pay special attention to the monetary policies, exchange affairs, and banking policies implemented by the American republics over the past decade." After Gaston finished speaking, the plenary session elected three committees to discuss the issues of gold standard currency value stability, the removal of trade barriers, and the improvement of mutual contact and loan amounts among the central banks of the respective countries.

### Roosevelt Asks Congress for Additional Temporary Funding of $271 Million for Various Expenses to Safeguard Neutrality

Washington—President Roosevelt recently told reporters that he has submitted a bill to the Finance Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives requesting an additional temporary appropriation of $271 million. This covers the various expenses incurred by the government to safeguard neutrality since the outbreak of the European war. Of this amount, $119 million is for the Army, $146 million for the Navy, $4.5 million for the Coast Guard, and $1.5 million for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. (Havas, 14th)

Washington—Under Secretary of State Welles recently told reporters that the Minister of the Republic of Southern Ireland to the United States has requested the U.S. government to revise the war zone designated by President Roosevelt so that American ships can continue to sail to Southern Ireland. The scope of the war zone was determined by the President after deliberation with the relevant cabinet ministers. Because the Republic of Southern Ireland has made this request, the State Department is conducting further thorough research and has not yet made a decision. President Roosevelt also stated that the neutral countries along the Baltic coast and the Scandinavian peninsula, as well as the people of the Netherlands and Belgium, have protested against the war zone he designated. In reality, there is a definite danger if American ships continue to navigate as usual within this zone. His intention is simply to prevent attacks on American ships. (Havas, 14th)

### Polish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Consult with British Authorities to Review the Diplomatic Situation

London—Polish Prime Minister General Sikorski and Foreign Minister Zaleski flew to London from Paris yesterday. This afternoon, they held talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax and attended a dinner hosted by the British government in the evening. It is reported that during the talks between the Polish cabinet members and Foreign Secretary Halifax, they reviewed the general situation and the diplomatic situation arising from the cooperation between Poland and its allies, England and France. Regarding this matter, well-informed sources said that the future of Poland is a delicate issue. For example, when Poland is restored in the future, England and France should not be forced to fight against the Soviet Union in order to recover the regions of Belarus and Ukraine. It is only that the responsibility for the war should be entirely attributed to Germany, and Germany should cede territory as compensation. The Polish authorities understand this situation and are well aware that it is not appropriate to make specific demands at this time; everything must depend on the circumstances. Currently, the most important thing for the Polish cabinet members is how Poland can cooperate militarily with its allies, England and France. Several Polish warships have already been incorporated into the British fleet and are patrolling in the North Sea. Prime Minister Sikorski will inspect them. The Polish army is currently training in France, and Poland's approximately £20 million in gold can also be used by England and France when necessary. (Havas, 14th)

### Two German Ships Attempt to Break Blockade, Ultimately Intercepted by British Ships

London—Qualified sources here claim that the German ships "Mecklenburg" and "Panara," while returning to Germany, attempted to reach Norwegian territorial waters by taking advantage of bad weather and northern fog, but were intercepted by British ships. This is another clear demonstration of the efficiency of British naval patrols. When the "Mecklenburg" was intercepted by a British ship two days ago, it disguised itself as the Dutch ship "Hogkerk." Both German ships had previously taken refuge in South American ports. When intercepted, the crew scuttled the ships to avoid capture. The reason German merchant ships are now leaving their neutral ports of refuge is that they are willing to accept total losses rather than continue to pay anchorage fees, due to Germany's lack of foreign currency. German merchant ships are now using various strategies to try to quietly pass through British naval patrols. Some German ships have escaped British naval patrols, but the return of German ships to Germany is of little use to Germany because, except for the Baltic Sea, all other seas are controlled by Britain.

The delegation will return to Ningxia from western Suiyuan after the 13th, planning to return to Chongqing via Pingliang and Xi'an. (13th)

### Anti-British Slogans Found Again in Beiping Yesterday

Beiping—Travelers arriving here reported that the Japanese side has tightened restrictions on the obstacles leading into the British concession in Tianjin. The blockade completed five months ago has now become "illegal profiteering," as those who want to pass quickly must pay a price, with varying fees. Coolies pay a few cents, while cargo trucks must pay over a hundred yuan. At the same time, anti-British activities, reportedly due to the suspension of funding, have been quiet for a week, but anti-British slogans have now been found again in Beiping. Morrison Road, Donghua Gate Road, Hadamen Road, and others are plastered with these slogans. Although newly printed, the wording is still familiar from before, such as "Down with Britain," "Exclude the British," and "Resist the British," all written in English. (Reuters, 15th)

### Wartime European March - Special Correspondence from London - The British Empire Enters the War

— Uncle Di

Indeed, Britain had no choice but to fight. - Reaching the point where it had no choice but to fight, in a situation where it had to fight, encountering the opportune moment to fight. Strictly speaking, now is already too late to fight. It has lost its most powerful ally, the Soviet Union, the heroic Spanish Republican government, Austria, the well-equipped Czechoslovakia, and Albania. The losses on this side represent the opposite, an increase in strength, on the enemy's side. The weakening and strengthening of this force, in Britain, has been deeply felt in the diplomatic blunders of the past few months. The traditional initiative of the British Empire on the European continent since the last great European war suddenly disappeared. Replacing it was the distrust of most countries towards Britain, except for France. In common parlance, it is the so-called "decline in prestige". As a result, in Britain's recent diplomatic negotiations, it has encountered unprecedentedly thorny situations and a sense of helplessness. Perhaps only the British government authorities involved can truly appreciate the bitterness within. According to the British authorities, this situation is attributed to the effects of German and Italian counter-propaganda. However, facts speak louder than words. The German and Italian propaganda machines repeatedly predicted that Britain was preparing to sell out the interests of other countries and succumb to aggressor nations, and later, just like Britain predicted the aggressive steps of Germany and Italy, they all came true one by one! In fact, why wait for the subsequent facts to prove it? In reality, even before the final revelation, Britain was always full of various activities. Trying to conceal all these activities from others and prevent them from knowing anything is fundamentally impossible, so why must the German and Italian propaganda machines expose them?

Germany and Italy recently predicted Britain's betrayal of Poland again, at a time when the war had not yet officially broken out. If Britain did not resolve to fight again, then the situation at that time would also be very clear: it would immediately lose Poland as an ally. After Poland was finished (whether it was an ally of Germany and Italy or a dependency of Germany and Italy), France would be next to become a target of aggression. The question of France is equivalent to the question of Britain; if the day of reckoning arrives for the French Empire, then the day of reckoning for the British Empire will arrive as well! However, the ultimate strategy of Chamberlain and his ilk in Britain is to abandon the British Isles altogether and move the capital to Canada in the event of necessity. These words sound alarming; however, this is by no means a masterpiece of Goebbels in Germany; the author of this, without any discount, is in the British Isles! Moreover, this is by no means an accidental utterance of a few individuals; the theoretical basis and detailed methods, if written in outline, would probably take several thousand words. Because it involves too much, I will not elaborate here.

My main point here is to explain that once Poland is finished, the next thing is the fate of England and France themselves. Following this line, it is very clear that it will inevitably lead to the collapse of the British Empire. Therefore, far-sighted people in Britain immediately won national support for their proposal, and Britain had no choice but to step forward and fight. - Even if Italy and Spain participate in the war, it doesn't matter.

It is already too late to fight now, but if we don't fight now, then things will be even worse later! So, if we are to fight, Britain has decided to fight now. - This is only one side of the issue.

However, there is another, more important side. During the Abyssinian question a few years ago, Britain could have fought, but it didn't; in the Spanish question, it also had the necessity of fighting or being willing to fight, but it sat idly by: the Austrian question, the Czech question, and this year's annexation of Albania were all major threats to its imperial interests, and each time, with the strong support of the Soviet Union and France, it was the best time for it to go to war. However, not only did it not fight, but on the contrary, it helped Germany and Italy repeatedly break up the cooperation and joint action between France and the Soviet Union. Now, in a situation where Germany and the Soviet Union have suddenly buffered, militarily speaking, the position of England and France is the most unfavorable it has been in these years, yet it has decided to start a war! Why is this?

Narrating in this way, we seem to have reached the crux of the matter; what kind of views and expectations did the British Empire have when it entered this war?

What attracts our attention very much at the beginning is the view of the far-sighted people in Britain, (by which I mean the group represented by Churchill, Eden, Halifax, and others,) on the "Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact." In the article above, I said that if Britain believed that the Soviet Union and Germany would truly form an alliance, then this war could not be fought. Now that I think about it, I didn't exaggerate at all; on the contrary, I would add another sentence: if Britain once discovered that the Soviet Union and Germany "truly" had a tendency to "ally," then I think that it would probably be the eve of the end of the war. This is just a hypothesis for the sake of explanation, which may be absolutely impossible in essence. Therefore, few people in Britain today believe in the "alliance" theory of the Soviet Union and Germany that is being spread by the propaganda and public opinion organs of England and France; that kind of statement is intended for people of other countries to see, and its effect is: to disappoint countries that originally had hopes for the Soviet Union; and to disappoint countries that originally had hopes for Germany. Therefore, in the international atmosphere of widespread disappointment with the Soviet Union and Germany, there is no doubt that there should be something else to be done, which should be the diplomacy of England and France.

The estimation of the future relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany, in form, seems to be similar to what Prime Minister Chamberlain said in Parliament: "It has no influence at all". But in reality, we must know that this is one of the most fundamental factors when Britain decides its attitude.

Hitler, with the "Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact" in one hand, directed his army to attack Poland. At that time, he indicated to Britain that this time his target was only Poland and had nothing to do with Britain; but on the other hand, Ciano persuaded Beck that England and France would not fight for Poland at this time, so the best plan was to compromise with Germany. If Britain had decided to fight at this time, then in the blink of an eye, Poland would have become an ally of Germany.

Poland's attitude wavered. But British diplomacy began to be active, supporting Poland and fighting together.

The situation is very obvious, such a danger exists; what if Poland is finally defeated by Germany? In that case, would Britain's current decision not be a self-inflicted annoyance?

The answer is absolutely no. The reasons can be summarized as follows: (1) If Poland is defeated and annexed, then an annexed Poland means adding an internal contradiction and burden to Germany. However, if a German-Polish compromise is reached and an alliance is formed, then it means that Britain has another emerging opponent in the battlefield of international demand for the redistribution of world resources. Which is the lesser of the two evils? It is obvious at a glance. (2) Poland has more than one million troops, and they are quite modernized. It goes without saying that Germany wants to thoroughly defeat them and must prepare for considerable consumption. (3) If the war is prolonged, friction between Italy and Germany over this matter will increase. (4) Under Germany's storm-like aggression, all the small countries of Southeastern Europe will panic. When Poland is in danger, they can of course automatically rise up to help Poland. (5) And the most important point is that once the Soviet Union and Germany lose such a powerful barrier as Poland is now, in any case, the future will be a time of turmoil. In any case, these two of Britain's greatest enemies will have to divide a part of their gaze of hostility towards Britain and look at each other.

It is not yet known whether these expectations on the British side can be fully realized. However, when Poland responded to the war, Britain had already achieved half of its current hope; when England and France simultaneously declared war on Germany, permanently closing the door to a German-Polish compromise, Britain's wishes at this stage have been fully realized.

Poland has already started to fight, and it should always fight on like this. - For its own sake, and for the sake of England and France.

The focus of everyone's attention at the moment is probably: how will Britain actually help Poland? Some time ago (and it is still being rumored now), it was said that England and France were preparing to immediately send a large number of expeditionary forces by sea to Poland when the war broke out, landing in Poland by way of the small countries of Northern Europe and Romania. Now, judging from various signs, this rumor is probably in vain. Moreover, under the circumstances of the strict neutrality of the Northern European countries and Romania, this plan, even if it exists, cannot be realized. At present, Britain's aid to Poland, according to the semi-publicly rumored plan here, is probably concentrated in two aspects: one is the support of the air force, and the other is loans. According to Poland itself, it can buy a large number of armaments from the Soviet Union. In short, in the future, the sincerity of England and France in helping Poland should be judged by the extent to which these two aspects are achieved in that stage.

Militarily speaking, without the participation of the Soviet Union, and in the situation where the rest of the Southeastern European countries and the Northern European countries do not participate in the war, Poland's response to the war against Germany has a political effect that far outweighs the military effect. This is a sacrificial and political war. It is probably absolutely impossible to win against Germany alone. In this stage, if the latter three kinds of international situations listed above finally arise as Britain wishes, then it should be said that it is the most ideal result, otherwise, we might as well be honest and say: the direction of Britain's war against Germany will have to be somewhat erratic. But erratic is not a retreat, on the contrary, because the direction is erratic, those helmsmen who are in charge of the British Empire's advance will have to seek a way out in advance in this turbulence.

### Resolutions of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Conference: Reorganizing County Education Administration, Providing Relief to Unemployed Educators in Occupied Areas

(Xinghua Correspondence) The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, in order to promote education in the province, specially convened a provincial education conference in Xinghua in September. Attendees included principals of provincial secondary schools, directors of county education bureaus, section chiefs and supervisors from counties where the bureau had been abolished, principals of county-run secondary schools, principals of private secondary schools, principals of provincial elementary schools, and relevant education personnel, totaling eighty-two people. Director Ma Yuanfang presided over the meeting, presenting reports and leading discussions.

Excerpts are as follows:

(A) Educational Administration Group

(1) The educational administrative organizations in counties of this province that have become war zones lack consistent standards for establishing bureaus, setting up sections, or merging sections. A draft of regulations for the wartime educational administrative organizations of counties in this province has been proposed, specifying standards for the educational administrative institutions in fully occupied and recovered counties. Is this feasible? Please discuss. Resolution: Amended and passed. (2) Education administration supervisors in guerrilla areas of this province cannot fully oversee their responsibilities. A section chief should be specially appointed within the county government to take charge, in order to facilitate progress. (3) Adjust and promote education administration in occupied counties. (4) Reform the local education supervision system. (5) Education committees should still be universally established in occupied areas. Please decide. (6) In occupied counties, in order to enhance the effectiveness of supervision, the full-time education committee system should be restored. (7) Education committees should still be established in occupied counties in order to strengthen supervision and liaison, and to increase educational effectiveness. (8) It is proposed to add one education committee member to occupied counties to facilitate supervision. (9) In occupied areas, roads are dangerous and schools are numerous, making county supervision exceptionally difficult. It is imperative to specify the number of education committee members in order to facilitate inspection. Resolution: The above eight proposals are combined for discussion. The main proposal is changed to "Adjusting the Educational Administrative Institutions of Various Counties," and it will be handled according to the temporarily regulations for wartime educational administrative organizations in this province, as amended and passed in the first proposal. (10) Drafted herein are notes on matters that county magistrates and education bureau chiefs in Jiangsu Province should address during wartime. Please discuss. Resolution: Amended and passed. (11) Education personnel in occupied areas who do not betray their principles should be given awards. Resolution: Passed. Please have the Education Department formulate award measures and announce them for implementation. (12) Since the start of the war of resistance, the central government has not issued clear laws or regulations for punishing and offering rehabilitation to education personnel who have collaborated with the enemy. In order to facilitate the punishment and handling of collaborationist personnel, a set of provisional measures for the punishment and rehabilitation of collaborationist education personnel in Jiangsu Province has been drafted. Is it feasible? Please discuss. (Resolution) Amended and passed. (13) The Education Department has successively issued education plans for various occupied counties, provisional measures for the restoration of elementary schools at all levels in occupied counties, provisional measures for the establishment of village private schools in occupied counties, and provisional measures for operating wartime mobile schools in occupied counties. Are there any difficulties in implementing these in the occupied areas? Should they be supplemented? Please discuss. Resolution: If there are difficulties, each county shall submit a separate report to the Department for approval. (14) A plan to destroy the enemy's puppet education is being drafted. Please discuss. Resolution: Amended and passed. (15) Please find ways to provide relief to education personnel in occupied areas. (16) Provide relief to unemployed teachers.

(18) How should graduates of secondary schools who are unable to continue their education be assisted? Resolution: Forwarded to the Department for reference. (19) How should schools at all levels in this province thoroughly implement the National Spiritual Mobilization and the National Covenant? (20) Please stipulate that the National Spiritual Mobilization and the National Covenant be the main content of moral education in all schools, and formulate detailed implementation measures. (21) Schools at all levels should intensify spiritual training. Resolution: The above three proposals are combined for discussion, with the seventeenth proposal as the main proposal. The key points for the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization and the National Covenant in schools at all levels in Jiangsu Province, as proposed in the seventeenth proposal, are amended and passed. (22) In the occupied areas, under the increasingly urgent encirclement of the enemy and puppets, all schools should minimize formal schooling and focus on content. Improving private schools and self-study tutoring groups should be vigorously encouraged and promoted. Their teaching, management, training, etc., should be handled in the same way as schools. Please decide. Resolution: Refer to and handle according to the provisions of the notes on matters that county magistrates and education bureau chiefs should address during wartime, as passed in the tenth proposal. (23) In the occupied areas, the population is constantly migrating, and the actual number of elementary school students is inevitably subject to sudden increases and decreases. The standard for student numbers should be slightly lowered to avoid the risk of school closure due to sudden decreases. Is this necessary? Please decide. Resolution: Each county shall submit its own report to the Department for approval. (24) What appropriate measures should be taken by schools in cities and towns during times of war emergency? (25) During times of war tension, if the education bureau cannot operate in towns and villages, it should immediately move to a safe location and send personnel to take charge in different areas in order to facilitate communication and increase efficiency. (26) This county has a vast territory and a special situation. If it is necessary to move the government office to a village to conduct administration, it will be inconvenient. Can branch offices be added to remedy this? Resolution: The above three proposals are combined for discussion.

Passed according to the original outline of the twenty-seventh proposal. (30) The supervision forms issued by the Department are very complete, but since their implementation, there have been many obstacles. Can they be appropriately changed to meet wartime needs? Please discuss. (31) The twenty-five types of forms previously issued to county supervisors are numerous and inconvenient to use. It is proposed to revise and create new forms. (32) The supervision forms issued by the Department in the sixth year are numerous. In this extraordinary period, it seems difficult to use them. How should they be changed? (33) It is proposed to revise the supervision forms for supervisors and education committee members to adapt to wartime needs. (34) It is proposed to revise the supervision forms for supervisors and education committee members to adapt to the supervision work in occupied counties. (35) Please revise the supervision forms for supervisors and education committee members for wartime use. Resolution: The above six proposals are combined for discussion. Please instruct the Department to issue simplified supervision report forms for supervisors and education committee members for use by various counties. (36) How should supervisors, education committee members, and inspectors submit reports on a regular basis to facilitate timely review and instruction to increase effectiveness? Resolution: Handle according to the regulations for supervisors and education committee members. (37) The elementary school counseling system should be restored and improved. It is proposed that the Department add provincial counselors, and that provincial elementary schools add directors (or counselors) of counseling departments.

Resolution: Forwarded to the Department for reference.

### Finance: Balancing Adding Positions and Closing Positions, Gold Market Falls Only Slightly

Yesterday's spot price of gold and black market situation did not change much, and the fluctuations were not large. However, the operators with relatively abundant strength were still adding positions as they saw fit, so although retail investors continued to emerge, there was no significant impact. The future is extremely difficult to grasp. In the current environment, it is feared that it may not be prosperous within this week. The market opened in the morning with a sluggish appearance, and was affected by the continued easing of foreign exchange and the cash number for sale, and fell to a low opening price of 3,645 yuan. Fortunately, soon Qian Duye and others competed to buy cheap goods, and the sluggishness was slightly recovered, hovering between 3,650 and 3,660 yuan. Around 10:30, foreign exchange suddenly reported that it was tightening again, and people's hearts were slightly shaken. Jinhao frequently added positions for speculators, and Li Angda reached 3,668 yuan. However, before the close, the selling wind came again due to the shift from soft to flat in the foreign exchange market, and it still fell back to 3,650 yuan. In the afternoon, the market was calm because there was no market on Wednesday for foreign exchange. Only the securities help bought some, and the price increased slightly. The closing price was already reported at 3,660 yuan, only a small one yuan higher than the previous day. The transaction throughout the day was slightly light, about a thousand taels. Silver jewelry shops remained unchanged all day, and customs gold was still flat.

Spot Gold Only Fell Two Yuan

Since the exhibition, each piece (ten taels) of gold initially opened because the foreign exchange market was slightly hardened, and the cash number was eager to sell. The opening price was actually reduced by 17 yuan. The cash number was sold to Yinhangbang for ten taels, for 3,645 yuan. After the opening, a certain Qian Duye came to buy cheap, and the seller took the opportunity to raise the price, and it immediately rebounded by 15 yuan. Qian Duye entered Zhengquanbang for 30 taels for 3,660 yuan. Later, Jinhao released more than 100 taels on behalf of customers, and the price was reduced by 10 yuan again. Jinhao sold 40 taels to Zhengquanbang for 3,650 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange suddenly reported that it was softening again, and people's hearts were shaken. A certain Jinhao bought it for speculators, and the Hong Kong gang also came to move around a little, so it rebounded by 18 yuan. Yinhangbang entered Jinhao for 20 taels, for 3,668 yuan. Then, the selling wind from retail investors started again, and the foreign exchange market had changed from tight to flat, and the entrants were sparse, so it fell by 18 yuan again. Qian Duye mutually did 10 taels, for 3,650 yuan. At noon, it rebounded again, Qian Duye entered Jinhao for 20 taels, for 3,654 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the situation became more and more quiet. The opening price increased by one yuan. Zhengquanbang entered Jinhao for 10 taels, for 3,655 yuan. Later, Zhengquanbang continued to absorb dozens of taels, and raised the price by five yuan again. Zhengquanbang entered Qian Duye for 20 taels, for 3,660 yuan. After entering, it fell back by two yuan. Qian Duye mutually did 10 taels, for 3,658 yuan. Later, Yinhangbang entered Jinhao for 20 taels, for 3,660 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it was small two yuan, and it has fallen for four consecutive days, a total of seventy yuan. The whole day was up and down by twenty-three yuan. The selling price of the licensed gold for cash was about 10 yuan higher than the spot gold. The purchase was reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current price of gold is 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold.

Jewelry Remains at the Original Price

The silver jewelry for each tael of jewelry was exchanged because the spot price rarely changed, so it did not change all day. Datonghang still maintained the original price of 370 yuan. The new Tonghang was the same as the upper price, and the purchase was still reduced by 15 yuan.

### Transactions Not Prosperous, Foreign Exchange Market Completely Flat

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC listing, there were no ups and downs. The dark market of British and American exchange rates showed a slight easing trend in the calm, but the result was not glorious or disgraced compared with yesterday's closing. At the beginning of the morning, the British and American exchange rates were slightly reduced, resulting in the opening of the market in a re-reporting of the old state of British flat and American tight. Later, because the Japanese line Zhengjin and the American line came to vomit and plug, and speculators continued to sell, although HSBC was willing to absorb when it was cheap, the head had already felt sufficient. British gold once grew to five ban shier wu, and the American exchange rate also hardened to eight yuan liuer wu. Then, importers needed to settle foreign exchange, and speculators also profited from short covering, so the market once softened, to five ban shier ling san yier wu and eight yuan ban. Extending to noon, buyers and sellers hesitated, and the transaction turned light, and it was reported to close in a stable state, British gold five ban shier yiba qi wu, American exchange rate eight yuan wu liuer wu, which was equivalent to the previous day. The futures trend was also the same as the spot. The transaction in half a day was flat.

Japanese Merchants Sell, Foreign Firms Enter

The exchange rate of British to American and to French was flat, and to Shanghai was big ling liu er wu. American to British small yier wu, to Shanghai long er jiao, to French rise yier wu. The central listing of each exchange rate was as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling price, British gold five ban shier yiba qi wu, American exchange rate eight yuan wu san yier wu, compared with the previous receipt, British flat American tight ling san yier wu, is the reason for the shrinking exchange rate. After the opening, the Japanese line came to block the sale, and American line and speculators also had a selling appetite, but HSBC sucked in when it was cheap, so the loosening trend was alleviated. It is estimated that Zhengjin vomited to HSBC spot British gold five ban shier wu, followed by speculators selling to Datong and other foreign lines spot American exchange rate eight yuan liuer wu, and at the same time a certain line also sold spot American exchange rate eight yuan wu liuer wu to counterparts. HSBC's listing revealed that it would not move, and the balance tax on silver was revealed to be small one cent er wu. After this, the foreign bank circle came to dig a little, and speculators and others covered short positions, so the situation once turned soft, and the foreign banks settled the spot American should be eight yuan wu liuer wu and half a yuan, and then the speculators covered the profitable December American exchange rate of eight yuan san qi wu, at the time British gold also followed the soft to five ban shier ling san yier wu, since the sale of the buyers waited and watched, the transaction suddenly thinned, so the state was also seen to be flat, extending to the noon receipt, the bank's spot selling price, British gold five ban shier yiba qi wu, American exchange rate eight yuan wu liuer wu, December British gold five ban shi er wu, American exchange rate eight yuan san qi wu, as a result, the current period of British and American exchange rates were not glorious or disgraced compared with the previous day, and there was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Unchanged

The "Joint Notes" black market also rose by qi jiao ban, to ninety-two yuan wu jiao.

### Foreign Exchange Fluctuations

Due to the weakness of the pound exchange rate, British gold notes slightly decreased. There was relatively strong demand for American gold notes, and the market price fluctuated with a firm undertone, initially at 11.62 yuan, and later in the evening at 11.625 yuan.

### Converting Sycee Gold to Standard Gold

Reply to Mr. Yongyu:

Since the Battle of Shanghai on August 13th, spot transactions of standard gold have completely ceased in the Shanghai market. Therefore, most of the standard gold on the market has been acquired and melted into sycee gold, as sycee gold is the only form in which gold bars are currently bought and sold. Therefore, selling standard gold to cash shops or jewelers requires deducting a certain amount for fire labor, but the amount is not large and there are no formal regulations. However, the fineness of standard gold is lower than that of sycee gold. Standard gold is only 9.78 fine, while sycee gold is 9.93 fine, a difference of 0.15. If you want to calculate the price of one "ping" (70 taels) of standard gold, simply multiply one "ping" (70 taels) of standard gold by the market price of sycee gold, and then multiply by the difference in fineness between standard gold and sycee gold. Subtract this amount from the market price of one "ping" of sycee gold to get the result. The formula is as follows:

### Discount Rate Unchanged

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills decreased from 37 yuan per 1,000 yuan in the morning to 36 yuan, then hovered between 36 and 37 yuan in the afternoon, ultimately closing at 37 yuan, the same as the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained at 0.15 yuan in both the morning and afternoon sessions, it is said.

### American Silver Still Weak, British and Indian Silver Declining

London, 14th: The silver market saw widespread selling and lacked support, with limited trading. The market was weak, and remained weak after closing. India showed some interest at the listed price. Bar silver saw a recent decline of 0.1875, and a forward decline of 0.25. New York silver report: American spot prices remained stable. Also, Bombay silver report: The Indian silver market was weak and sluggish. Spot and December futures both fell 17 annas, and January futures fell slightly by 15 annas.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Listless, Foreign Stocks Recover

In the gray market for securities, yesterday's market, after a rebound the day before, lacked the ability to continue rising. The rumors of borrowing remained unfounded nonsense. A slight increase in market sentiment was exploited by long-term speculators to sell off their holdings. To suppress, one must raise, this is indeed a tactic of long-term speculation. However, it is a pity that those who blindly follow do not think and drift with the tide. Rumors from Nanjing grew louder and louder. Yesterday, the market price was initially firm in the morning, then weakened, and finally stabilized slightly. The bulls were still struggling. The shrewd bulls were slowly unloading their holdings. In the afternoon, they initially tried to rally the market again to confuse the public, but more and more people sold off their holdings, and the market price slowly declined. However, some retail investors were still buying on the dip. Tiensheng, Dafeng, Jiufeng, and others continued to sell. As a result, Category B bonds broke 9 yuan, and Category E bonds broke 8 yuan. The slight rise the day before was completely fleeting, down 0.01 to 0.05 yuan compared to the day before. The total transaction volume was approximately 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock transactions: 20 shares of Ning Shao Steamship Company were traded at a price of 8 yuan.

The public exchange market was quiet and trending firm. Steel stocks stood out, opening at only 12.20 yuan and gradually rising to 13.20 yuan for buying and 13.30 yuan for selling at closing. The transaction volume was considerable. Rubber stocks remained slightly soft.

London, 14th: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds remained stable, with no gains or losses for bonds of all grades.

London, 14th: Today's listed prices for British Far East company stocks reversed course and declined. Most stocks saw declines. Shanghai Waterworks A shares fell 1 pound to 10 pounds even. Mercantile Bank shares continued to fall 5 shillings to 8 pounds even. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (London Registered) shares fell 1 pound to 84 pounds. Kulak-Lim Rubber shares fell 2 pence to 18 shillings 1 pence.

### Yarn and Cotton: Strong Demand for Coarse Yarn, Prices Without Major Fluctuations

The yarn market was calm, but with narrow fluctuations and light trading, so the situation was not strong. As for current yarn sales, fine yarn was not widespread, but 10-count coarse yarn was still being generously taken by buyers from various southern provinces, who were constantly seeking it. However, in order to reduce inventory and promote sales, factories were willing to sell, so the market price could not rise, but it was higher than the price of 20-count yarn. Currently, the general opinion among operators is that there is no hope for a decline in raw cotton prices, and factory costs are increasing, so the foundation of the yarn market may be further consolidated.

The opening of the spot yarn market this morning saw no major changes, with the opening price at 647 yuan. The foreign exchange rate was then quoted as unchanged, and market sentiment was even. After a while, it was heard that demand for coarse yarn from Guangdong buyers was still strong, and traders resumed buying, and the price rose back to 648 yuan. However, the market situation was still scattered and weak. A total of 1,355 bales were traded in the first half of the day, and the market was generally similar to the previous day. Chongxin Factory opened with 250 bales of 20-count Dafu yarn at a price of 612 yuan for immediate payment, and 100 bales of 10-count Dafu yarn at a price of 520 yuan. Today, 144 pieces of yarn were exported to Hong Kong, and 15 pieces to Guangzhou Bay. The amount purchased by each buyer group is listed below:

Traders: 785; Fuzhou: 125

Yunnan: 25; Hong Kong: 350

Inland: 70; Total: 1,355

### Cotton Merchants Hoard, Waiting to Sell at a Good Price

Cotton trading was slightly quiet, because the yarn market was weak, and factory appetite was not strong. Japanese factories sought to take action, but Yong'an Factory recently opened up a lot in coarse yarn, supplementing Pingguo'er raw materials to offset costs, only slightly embellishing it. However, traders were thinking intensely, and have already packaged and stored dried and clean cotton in warehouses, waiting to sell at a good price, showing a strong bullish sentiment. From Northern Jiangsu, there were 3,725 bales of Tong cotton, 488 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 674 pieces of Beisha cotton. Today, 357 pieces of cotton were exported to Hong Kong, and 50 pieces to Haikou. The current cotton situation is recorded below:

Haiti Point: 127.00; Trader purchased: 200 bales

Changyinsha: 129.50; Trader purchased: 400 bales

Tong Cotton: 135.00, 135.40; Trader purchased: 362 bales

American Fine Cotton: 129.50; Trader purchased: 200 bales

Tong Cotton: 135.25; Trader purchased: 300 bales

Pingguo'er: 28.00; Yong'an purchased: 200 pieces

Another report: The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has recently become dull again. Yarn sales have not improved, so factories are quiet, and traders are also taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, Japanese manufacturers still have sporadic transactions in American cotton, but the number is very small, and they are all for immediate shipment. However, the general opinion is that American cotton trading may have a prosperous day.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market has been very active recently. It showed a firm trend from the beginning yesterday morning. The number of cloth sales is improving daily, and Yan Jinfu has a large number of openings, so factory demand is very healthy, triggering a large number of spot transactions. Traders were therefore intensely purchasing in the market, so there was a soaring wind, and it triggered a large number of short covering. Yesterday's closing price rose another 3 to 4 points compared to the previous day. However, yesterday's Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by more than 4 rupees. The Egyptian market has been closed for two days, and Liverpool fell by 7 pence.

### Grain: Customer Xiang Rice Hoarding, Some Selling Yesterday

The rice market has been soaring all week, and all prices seem to have reached their peak. After the market softened once the day before yesterday, yesterday's opening was still normal. However, hoarders, seeing that actual sales were becoming cold, privately calculated that there seemed to be little hope of profit, and almost all stopped. In addition, the appetite of local countryside shops was increasingly sluggish, which reversed the previous sensation and showed weakness. However, the vendors from other places still held on to their strategies due to their own interests, and were unwilling to relax their sales. With both sides holding on, the mid-market phenomenon formed a fixed color. However, at this time, the market is constantly changing drastically, and regardless of buyers or sellers, they are wary of any market downturn. Seeing this situation, hoarders suddenly sold, and many people followed suit. A large number of people sold, and the market was full of goods. Local customers all stood by and watched, the sales ground became more sluggish, and the market was difficult to support, resulting in a downstream result. If the new japonica rice arrives, it is uniquely prosperous, with 23-24 trucks of Su, Kun, Qing, Si, Feng, and Lian goods. The market is half a yuan cheaper than the previous market price. Other goods also depreciated by different amounts of 0.2-0.3 yuan. The initial opening price of Jiangbei sharp rice was 28 yuan, and the closing price was 27.8 yuan, then down to 27.3-27.4 yuan. The initial opening price of Jingwu sharp rice was 28.1-28.2 yuan, then only 18.28 yuan and 27.8 yuan and a half, then down to 26.5 yuan for broken rice. The total number of transactions in the unified market was only over 6,000 bags.

In the morning, customer Xiang rice merchants continued to inquire with shops and countryside operators, and the sellers raised the price again, and the market price once rose by 0.1-0.2 yuan. However, the appetite of shops was very weak, and they stopped after buying a little. Also, the countryside was watching with expensive prices, and hoarders' manipulation gradually lacked a basis. Then it was heard that a certain firm had 20,000 bags of Anhui Xiang rice that had just arrived yesterday, which was being unloaded into warehouses, and floating profits were immediately sold, so the market gradually fell. The total market transaction was also less than 2,000 bags. However, the high price of Wuhu Xiang rice has been opened up to 28.2 yuan, it is said.

### No Whole-Batch Outlet for Flour

The current flour market is quite mediocre, because the sales ground is lifeless. There are only sporadic embellishments from both the North and South factions, and there is no large outlet. Even retail transactions on this street are affected by the cheap dumping of miscellaneous flour from the inland, and the appetite is sluggish. Only a small number of retail investors from the Qingdao faction in the unified market, and the Hong Kong faction, due to available ship positions, have slightly configured it. The transaction volume is less than 30,000 bags. The second flour factory continued to open at 7.1 yuan, and the selling price of warehouse receipt flour was different by 0.05-0.1 yuan. The situation is generally similar to the previous one.

The wheat market continued to be deadlocked, and the appetite of various factories was consistently sluggish. Hoarders are even more on the sidelines and do not take action. As a result, only three trucks of Suzhou wheat were traded in the market, at a price of 11.15 yuan, which is 0.2-0.3 yuan lower than before, it is said.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Rises Again

Kobe Barrel Oil: 75 Yuan; Raw Oil Shipped to Hong Kong in Large Quantities

The soybean oil market, under the potential of no surge in sources, has created a monopoly for speculators, resulting in repeated and sharp price increases. Kobe barrel oil has reached a rare high price of 75 yuan. Although bulk oil is relatively looser, the overall situation is still moving forward, and the market is rising frequently. Yesterday, barrel oil rose by 1.5 yuan, and bulk oil rose by 1.2-1.3 yuan. Ten barrels of Kobe oil were traded, and the price is detailed in the market price column. Twenty barrels of Dalian oil, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 100 pieces of Qingqi oil, 100 pieces of Yanqi oil, 30 barrels of Jiangbei barrel oil, and 50 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were traded. Also, 100 barrels will be delivered in 2-3 weeks. Peanut oil saw a small movement from Hong Kong buyers, with 100 pieces from this street going to Jiaozhou, and 150 barrels of Qingdao oil. The market is 1-5 yuan higher than the previous market.

Hong Kong, calculated by the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai, and for the sake of accumulation, and at the time of the emergence of new raw oil, raw oil shipped to Hong Kong is quite incessant. Yesterday, another 160 pieces and 4,140 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong. There were also 123 bags of raw kernels and 967 bags of beans exported to Hong Kong today. 1817 bags of beans were shipped to Haikou, and only 220 bags of beans arrived in Shanghai, coming from Beisha.

### Piece Goods: Loose and Tight Camel Down are Selling Well in Time

Yesterday, there were more retail transactions than wholesale in the woolen cloth market, and the price of goods remained firm. However, the seller secretly seemed willing to increase the commission transferred by the brokers. Loose and tight camel down are now in season, so sales are very prosperous. All woolen cloth businesses are thriving. The wholesale price of first-grade Mao Bei camel down is 5.75 yuan per yard. Tiansheng Invincible brand Art Velvet is 5.5 yuan per yard. Weilin Tiger Pattern is 5.25 yuan. Weiyi Double Deer Pattern is 2.75 yuan. Art Velvet is 3.6 yuan. Tianhe Wufu brand is 2.05 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands and second-grade goods are generally sold for 1.8-1.9 yuan. Foreign goods and silk shops are more prosperous than woolen cloth shops.

Today, 184 pieces of piece goods were exported to ??? Port, 97 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 28 pieces to Haiphong, and 244 pieces to Haiphong.

### Metals: Deformed Steel Bars Slightly Inferior

Deformed steel bars were very strong a few days ago. Construction firms on this street and buyers from Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao all purchased a lot. However, since recently, people's minds have changed, and standards have softened. Compared to the past, they are slightly inferior by 40-50 yuan. The current market price is 750 yuan per ton for 3-4 points, and 710 yuan per ton for 5 points to 1 inch. A few days ago, construction firms purchased more than 20 tons, Qingdao firms announced the purchase of 30 tons (but did not ship it). Tianjin and Yantai also shipped more than 10 tons. About 20 tons were shipped to Ningbo, and more than 10 tons to Fujian, it is said.

### Statistics: Price Changes

— Hui

—September—(1)

The rising price trend of September continued unabated. The main reason was the impact of the war in Europe. Because merchants generally feared that foreign goods sources would be blocked, and they could only rely on the existing goods on the market, which could not supply long-term sales in the future, the psychology of hoarding prevailed in Shanghai. Even non-industry hoarders hoped for the wealth dreams of the last European war, and wildly raised prices to collect and hoard. Under the dual pressure, how could prices not be expensive? Therefore, the sound of price increases was heard every day, and the social impact was undoubtedly accelerating the reduction of purchasing power. Here, only the price increase notices published in newspapers in September are counted. The prices of raw materials originally differed in the morning and evening, and each newspaper's commercial conditions column had listings for reference. This is omitted here. A total of 137 price increases occurred in September, a decrease of 29 from August. The 137 types of goods with price increases can be divided into 16 categories: food and beverage, clothing, daily necessities, metal and electrical, printing and publishing, medicine, cultural supplies, packaging, transportation, cosmetics, fuel, construction, decoration, raw materials, cleaning and hygiene, and candles. Among them, food and beverage items ranked first with 26 price increase units, metal and electrical items ranked second with 21, daily necessities ranked third with 19, transportation items ranked fourth with 17, medicine items ranked fifth with 16, cultural supplies ranked sixth with 13, clothing and cosmetics ranked seventh with 12 each, printing and publishing ranked eighth with 8, construction items ranked ninth with 6, packaging, fuel, and raw materials ranked tenth with 3 each, decoration items ranked eleventh with 2, and cleaning and hygiene and candles ranked last with 1 each.

Although the Japanese troops tried their best to negotiate, the British troops insisted on not allowing them to pass.

### Shanghai American Military Commander Replaced by Baker; Assumes Office in China in February Next Year; Former Commander Fegan Has Received Orders

United Press International, Washington, 14th: According to the US Navy Department, Colonel Baker has been appointed as the commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment of the US Navy in Shanghai and will assume office in China in February next year. The current commander of the American forces in Shanghai is Colonel Fegan. Colonel Baker was born in 1894 and is originally from California. He graduated from the US Naval Academy and served as a major officer in the US Marine Corps in 1915.

According to the Continental News, yesterday (the 14th), it was heard from reliable sources that Colonel Fegan, the commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment of the US Navy stationed in Shanghai, has received orders to return to Washington. The Fourth Marine Regiment Command has not yet issued a statement, but it is said that Colonel Fegan will return to the United States by the beginning of next year, and his successor has also been appointed as Colonel Baker. Colonel Baker is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at the end of January or the beginning of February, but the exact date has not yet been determined. Colonel Fegan came to China from Washington about a year ago and succeeded Colonel Plath as the commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment.

### Commemorating the Founding of the Marine Corps: US Military Holds Grand Parade; Antique Uniform Performance Most Spectacular; Military Leaders from Various Nations Attend to Observe

Yesterday, the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse was filled with guests. More than two thousand Americans and their friends from various countries were invited to witness the celebration of the 164th anniversary of the founding of the United States Marine Corps, hosted by the Fourth Regiment of Marines stationed in Shanghai. The original anniversary of the US Marine Corps is November 10th, but due to continuous rain last week and accumulated water on the field, the ceremony was postponed to yesterday.

The weather was perfect.

The event proceeded extremely successfully. Yesterday's US military parade was perhaps the most spectacular of the twelve years since the Fourth Regiment of Marines arrived in Shanghai. The ceremony included performances and modern military drills. The highlight of the performances was the appearance of four Marines dressed in the green and maroon uniforms of the US Marine Corps from 164 years ago, before the audience. Then, in quick

costume changes,

the equipment was altered, displaying the changes in uniforms, vehicles, and military equipment throughout the generations, presenting a living history to the audience. This performance was the idea of Colonel Fegan, the commander of the Fourth Regiment of Marines. Colonel Fegan had been designing this historical performance for many years, having been

engaged in research

before coming to China. He originally planned to hold it at the US Marine Barracks in Washington, but unexpectedly received orders to come to Shanghai to command the Fourth Regiment of Marines, and this grand performance was moved to Shanghai. The antique uniforms worn by the performing soldiers were designed by Colonel Fegan himself and tailored in Shanghai. The performance team also carried the original flag of the thirteen colonies

the earliest banners

and the ancient flag with the "Don't Tread on Me" rattlesnake graphic, which were also made in Shanghai. When Admiral Hepburn, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Colonel Fegan of the Shanghai Marines Fourth Regiment, and staff officers of the Asiatic Fleet stepped onto the reviewing stand, they received a solemn and enthusiastic salute from the soldiers. After the inspection, a banquet was held at the Marines Club on Jing'an Temple Road.

Those at the banquet

included Major Morandi, Commander of the Italian Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai; Major Banti Volio, Law Enforcement Officer of the Italian Marine Corps; Colonel Hongbei, Commander of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps; Faber, Commissioner of the French Police, and his wife; Major General Kanto Yoshinobu, Commander of the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai; Kurihara, Senior Staff Officer of the Japanese Marine Corps; Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the US Yangtze Patrol; Admiral

Hepburn,

Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, and his family; Mr. Gao Qi, US Consul General; Major General Tibet, Commander of the British Defense Force stationed in Shanghai; Lieutenant Colonel Maulai, Commander of the West Forze Highland Team; Lieutenant Colonel Sivanton, Commander of the East Auxiliary Team; and Colonel Glini, Commander of the French Defense Force stationed in Shanghai.

### The Future of Portuguese Shipping is Uncertain; Portuguese Consulate Claims All Ships Released Unconditionally; But Portuguese Shipping Companies Fail to Confirm This

According to the Continental Times, the status of the eleven Portuguese ships officially announced to have been released by the Japanese naval authorities last week remains unresolved. Although the Portuguese Consulate claims that all ships were released unconditionally, inquiries to the five Portuguese shipping companies to which the detained ships belong failed to confirm this. According to an official from the Portuguese Atlantic Company yesterday (the 14th), the company's "Hailong"

has been released,

but on the condition that the ship be inspected by the "Dadao" government's "Navigation Bureau." The fees charged for this special inspection by the Japanese-backed regime are likely to be quite high, but the ship itself will not be registered with the puppet regime and will continue to sail under the Portuguese flag. Furthermore, an official from another Portuguese company, Mouchang, claimed that they had received notification of the release of their company's ships, but were currently waiting for the Japanese to propose conditions so that their company's ships could resume sailing. According to reliable sources,

the merger of five small

companies to form a large Portuguese shipping company is currently underway. However, due to the large number of ship owners involved, the organization of the company is proceeding slowly. The Portuguese Consul General denied rumors that the Portuguese authorities in Shanghai would no longer allow any ships to be registered, claiming that the rumors were completely unfounded. It was also reported that five Portuguese shipping companies were discussing a merger to form a large company, which is currently underway. According to reporters from Dagong News Agency, inquiries to the Portuguese American Steamship Company, Zhengde Steamship Company, and Huamei Shipping Company, which represents Portuguese ships,

were unanimously denied.

There is no merger of new companies or business dealings, and it is practically impossible. However, it is known that someone is indeed organizing a new company to restore the operation of the released ships.

### Movements of British Troops Stationed in Shanghai

One Company of the East Surrey Regiment May Be Transferred to Tianjin to Replace Another

Since the British government decided to withdraw troops stationed in North China, yesterday, according to a United Press dispatch from Tianjin, one company of the East Surrey Regiment of the British Defense Force in Shanghai will be sent to Tianjin to replace the British Defense Force Light Infantry Regiment of the Fulham Regiment to protect the interests of British expatriates. When reporters inquired with the British Defense Force Command here, they said it was too early to confirm, but the content of the news was not wrong. There are also rumors that the entire West Force Highland Team of the British Defense Force in Shanghai will be withdrawn soon, but this could not be confirmed yesterday.

### Zhejiang Authorities Strictly Prohibit Sailors from Hiding Strong Young Men

According to news from the shipping industry, in order to strengthen the war effort and maximize the replenishment of manpower, the military authorities in Zhejiang Province previously issued an order to all counties strictly prohibiting strong young men from coming to Shanghai. However, since the resumption of the Shanghai-Ningbo route, many sailors have been tempted by large profits and often hide strong young men to smuggle them out. Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command, in view of the fact that selected strong young men must not move without a permit issued by the county, and that those who move without a permit will be treated as draft dodgers, and that there are clear provisions for the recruitment of national service and the implementation of lottery in Zhejiang Province during the emergency period, it is therefore considered that smuggling strong young men to Shanghai, even if there is no traitorous behavior, is also helping draft dodging, and should be dealt with in accordance with the Criminal Law and the Regulations for Punishing Crimes against the Military Service Law. A special telegram was sent to the Provincial Military Control Command to instruct all counties to comply. After receiving the order, the Yinxian County Government immediately forwarded it to all district offices and the Yinxian Shipping Association for notification.

### Fudan and Aurora Universities Mourn Ma Xiangbo Yesterday Morning; The Two Assemblies Were Solemn and Respectful, with the Utmost Honors; Permanent Commemoration Measures are Being Planned; A Centenary Shrine is Being Built in Chongqing

Chongqing: The Ma Xiangbo Memorial Society has been discussing commemoration measures for several days. In addition to (1) holding a memorial service, (2) publishing posthumous works, (3) raising funds to support the family, and (4) building a Xiangbo Library at Fudan University, concrete steps have been formulated. Now, at the suggestion of Yu Youren, a "Centenary Shrine" will be built in Chongqing to show eternal commemoration of this virtuous and respected elder. It is reported that Wu Zexiang, Secretary-General of Chongqing Municipality, representing He Guoguang, has agreed to use the old site of Fuzichi as the construction site for the Centenary Shrine. It is also heard that funds will be raised separately for the project. Changing Fuzichi to the Centenary Shrine is of great significance. (15th Dispatch)

After Mr. Ma Xiangbo passed away in Liangshan, Aurora and Fudan Universities, which he founded, held memorial services and Requiem Masses at the Saint Peter's Church on Rue Lupan and the sixth floor of the Pudong Fellow Association respectively, yesterday morning. In addition to the entire staff and students of both schools, people from all walks of life attended the ceremonies, which were extremely crowded and honored. Details of each event are as follows:

Fudan Memorial Service

Over a Thousand People Attended, with the Utmost Honors

Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Fudan University held the "Memorial Service for Master Ma Xiangbo" on the sixth floor of the Pudong Building. More than a thousand people attended, including members of the Board of Trustees of the university, university, affiliated high school, experimental middle school, alumni association, faculty, students, and guests from all walks of life, including Wen Lanting, etc., with the utmost honors. Each guest was given a badge with the "Portrait of the Master from Dantu," which was pinned to their chest as a memorial. The venue was decorated with white cloth banners in front of the Pudong Building. The surroundings of the venue were hung with elegiac couplets presented by the faculty, students of Fudan, and guests from all walks of life. The altar was also decorated with white cloth banners, decorated with pine, cypress, and flowers. The national flag, the Fudan school flag, and the portrait of Mr. Ma Xiangbo were hung in front. Although the arrangement was very simple, it was solemn and respectful, and admirable.

Separate Tributes, Solemn Ceremony

The memorial service began at 10:00 AM, and the ceremony was solemn. First, Chairman Xia Jingguan paid tribute, and the entire assembly paid the most respectful bow three times to the portrait of Mr. Ma Xiangbo. Then, Guo Zhongliang, representative of the Fudan Board of Trustees, Jin Tongyin of the University Department, Yin Yiwen of the Affiliated High School, Zhu Zushun of the Experimental Middle School, and Xu Xiaochu of the Alumni Association, offered flowers separately. Chen Zhongda respectfully read the memorial text, and Mao Xibi Yidu read the biography of Ma Xiang.

Overwhelmed with Grief, Compilation of Speeches

Afterwards, the chairman delivered a speech, saying that Mr. Ma was very enthusiastic and accomplished in running education during his lifetime. Now that the teacher is dead, his spirit will last forever. He hoped that future generations would follow the teacher's legacy and work hard. Then Huang Bingfu gave a speech, saying that not long ago, a grand centenary celebration was held for Mr. Ma, and it was hoped that Mr. Ma would reach one hundred and ten or one hundred and twenty, but today, months later, this memorial service is being held, and all walks of life are extremely sad. But who can avoid death in life, only death is heavier than Mount Tai, lighter than a feather. During his lifetime, the teacher was loyal to the country and concerned about the country. Some months ago, he received a letter from the teacher saying, "Why linger in a foreign land when old age beckons?" It can be seen that the teacher's death was by no means painless, but was a heart disease, sacrificing himself for the country. Although the teacher's body has passed away, his spirit will last forever. The widespread irrigation of the teacher's spirit is the new life of the Republic of China. Later, Zhang Chongren, the representative of Mr. Ma Xiangbo's family, gave a reply, reporting the course of the teacher's illness (see previous report), saying that when I got married not long ago, my father-in-law still earnestly instructed that the country was in trouble, and that everything should be frugal except for the necessary ceremonies, and thanked everyone on behalf of the Ma family. The meeting was then adjourned.

Aurora Memorial Ceremony

Aurora University in this city was also founded by Teacher Ma. All teachers and students cherish the spring breeze and specially joined Catholic friends to hold a Requiem Mass at Saint Peter's Church on Rue Lupan at 7:30 AM yesterday morning to express their condolences. Details are as follows:

Catholic Friends, Requiem Mass

At 7:00 AM, in the faint morning light, Aurora students and Catholic friends in black crowns and white clothes flocked to Rue Lupan, rushing to Saint Peter's Church. President Chaylard of Aurora University stood in front of the stone steps of the church, greeting guests. Ma Xiang's nephews Zhu Zhiyao and Zhu Jilin, his great-grandson Zhang Chongren and his wife, and those who had known the Ma family in their lifetime, also entered the church to participate in this grand Requiem Mass. According to statistics, no less than a thousand people participated.

Solemn Arrangement, Solemn Air

The church was arranged in a very solemn manner. The altar was surrounded by wooden fences, with a memorial platform in the middle, covered with soft silk, similar to a coffin, to represent Mr. Ma's remains. Upstairs at the entrance of the church, there was an orchestra and choir, playing elegies. The altar and the memorial platform were surrounded by white torches, and the shining light flickered in the solemn air.

Chanting Scriptures, Mournful Music Lingering

At 7:30 AM, the main priest, Father Yao Zhanchen, and the accompanying priests, Father Qiao Dianai and Father Fu, dressed in brilliant religious robes, stepped in front of the altar amidst the lingering sounds of mournful music, praying aloud and chanting scriptures, rising and falling, corresponding to the elegies and mournful music. After a while, eight boys holding sacred lamps were added, and led by the main priest Father Yao, they circled the memorial platform twice, sprinkling holy water everywhere to bless the remains. Finally, the Eucharist ceremony was held. This solemn and grand Requiem Mass was completed in order in one hour, and it dispersed at 8:30 AM.

Planning Permanent Commemoration

In order to permanently commemorate Mr. Ma, Aurora and Fudan Universities intend to launch the organization of a library and compile and print Mr. Ma's posthumous works, and coordinate commemoration measures for long-term remembrance. Aurora is actively preparing for it. The Fudan Alumni Association also received a telegram from Wu Nanxuan, Vice President of Fudan University in Beibei, claiming, "The Fudan Board of Trustees and Alumni Association in that place plan to raise funds to build a library for Mr. Ma in Beibei and compile and print his posthumous works for permanent commemoration."

Fudan's Memorial Text

On November 15th, the 28th year of the Republic of China, the Fudan University Board of Trustees, Fudan University, Fudan Affiliated Middle School, Fudan Experimental Middle School, and Fudan Alumni Association, respectfully offer this clean wine and offerings to the spirit of former President Ma Xiangbo from Dantu, saying: Alas, Master rose in East Asia, renowned in the world. For five hundred years, he revived the decline, inspired the deaf and shook the blind, followed like the wind, and was respected by all. Master's achievements are recorded in the country. Cai Yang promoted labor, traveled at home and abroad, enjoyed after worry, and established national peace. Long-term planning, the interests of the country were gained. Master's way is like a dragon, kind and loving, kind and gentle, upright and unhidden, pure and devoted, and deeply understood by rituals, attracting attention from the court and the public. Master's heart is like the moon and the sun, with clean ambitions and integrity, embracing simplicity and guarding unity. He left the Southern State and rested in Liangshan, enduring hardships and remaining steadfast, and the Mingyi divination was auspicious. Master's learning is a deep study of heaven and man, gaining knowledge and investigating things, subtle and boundless, measuring power comprehensively, and having great and pure thoughts. Translating the Four Saints, reversing the three gods. Master's years were healthy and long-lived, with a jade face and square pupils, thick eyebrows and white hair. He communicated with An Qi in art and joined Shao Hao in years. Like a mountain and a ridge, he was a treasure to the country. Master's teachings were old and diligent, transmitting scriptures in Zhushui and lecturing in He Fen. Fang Du received his studies, and Liu Jia was able to write. Students gathered widely, and the green tent was famous. Heaven truly produced a sage, surpassing the ancients and the present, a blessing to the country and a ferry to the people. There is no way to stay the scene, how can it be suddenly ended? Family sacrifices must not be forgotten, and the determination to die will be lost. I mourn this old man, why not ask for a legacy? What was previously admired, now lost and no one to rely on. Not what A likes, public opinion is here. The world's grief, the private of the disciples. Mount Tai collapsed, and there is no way to climb. The affection of teachers and the depth of thoughts. I steal a stick of incense, what can I rely on? Keeping the heart in my clothes, building a hut for the grave. Mountains and rivers are separated, and it is difficult to express words. The wine and shame are respectfully offered, only sincerity and reverence. May the spirit come to enjoy and see the foolish heart, remembering the beginning and the end, tears pouring down. Alas, enjoy it!

Ma Xiang's Deeds

Mao Xibi, who wrote and read Mr. Xiang's deeds, said: The teacher's surname is Ma, his name is Xiangbo, and he is from Danyang, Jiangsu. His father, Duke Songyan, practiced medicine and was fond of giving. His mother, Madam Shen, was also happy to do good. The teacher was born on March 19th of the 20th year of the Qing Daoguang reign (72 years before the founding of the Republic of China), the year the British captured Zhoushan in the Opium War. He entered school at the age of five. In that year, his younger brother Meishu was born, so the teacher was five years older than Meishu. Combining the General's life and deeds, it can be divided into four periods, which are described as follows:

(1) The period of youth cultivation. After entering school, he read the classics of the church and the Four Books. He was extremely intelligent and able to recite everything he saw. At the age of eleven, he entered Xuhui Public School with his younger brother Meishu. After finishing the Four Books and Five Classics, he studied in the general course for ten years, and then in the specialized course for another ten years. He was fluent in religion, philosophy, Greek, Latin, physics, chemistry, and mathematics.

(2) The period of preaching and politics. The teacher was fourteen years old when Hong Xiuquan entered Jinling. After twenty, he was ordered by the church to engage in relief work in the Su-Tai area, working diligently and tirelessly. At the age of thirty, he was ordained as a priest by the Roman Catholic Church. He then preached in Su-Wan and obtained the consent of Duke Songyan to distribute wealth to relieve the disaster and raise funds for the flood relief. These are all the teacher's inheritance of family education, and the promotion of Christ's love of God and love of neighbor, as well as for the suffering people. In terms of politics, he mainly handled foreign affairs and deliberated on politics. Handling foreign affairs was between the ages of twenty-six and fifty-six, a period of twenty years. He first entered Li Wenzhong's staff to help with foreign affairs, and was deeply appreciated. He planned to establish a national bank and was sent to the United States to borrow 50 million, but it was not successful due to the opposition of court officials. In order to consolidate diplomatic relations, he was sent to Korea, but the Grand Yuanjun could not use him. He went to France to inspect business affairs and was warmly welcomed. After the age of fifty, he served as the consul in Nagasaki and the counselor of the embassy. He served as the director of foreign affairs in Jiangsu in the first year of the Republic of China. During the period of deliberation on politics, it also lasted for ten years. In the second year before the founding of the Republic, the Jiangsu Provincial Advisory Bureau was established, and the teacher was elected as a provincial councilor. In the second year of the Republic, it was changed to the Provincial Assembly. In the third year of the Republic, Yuan's order was dissolved, and it was revived in the sixth year of the Republic. Since then, the teacher has been elected in every election, and has contributed greatly to the politics of Jiangsu Province.

(3) The period of running schools. The teacher was already sixty-four years old when he ran Aurora. He invested tens of thousands of dollars with the purpose of starting with language and seeking Western learning subjects. There are four main categories: (A) Linguistics, (B) Mathematics, (C) Physics, (D) Zhi Zhi Xue. The teacher himself taught Latin, Zhi Zhi Xue, and Mathematics. On Sundays, he gathered to give lectures. Other subjects were taught by church elders. The school administration was assisted by students, which opened up the pioneer of student autonomy. The teacher was already sixty-six years old when he established Fudan after Aurora disbanded. He asked Jiang Du Zhou Fu to allocate more than 70 mu of official land in Wu淞炮台 as the school site and allocated 20,000 yuan. He opened the school first at the Wu淞提督行轅 and obtained Jiang Du's approval to allocate 1,000 yuan per month as a regular expense. The foundation of Fudan Public School was laid. The teacher was the first president. The following year, he was sent to Japan to handle the aftermath of returning students. Within two years, the president was changed three times, Yan Youling, Xia Jiancheng, and Gao Mengdan. He returned to his post in the third year before the founding of the Republic. In the second year before the founding of the Republic, he concurrently served as the director of Jiaomu as a councilor of the Advisory Bureau. During the Xinhai Restoration, the Wu淞 school building was occupied and suspended for one year. In the first year of the Republic, the teacher ordered Yu Youren and Shao Lizi to ask the authorities to allocate the Li Gong Ancestral Hall in Xujiahui as the school building and obtained President Sun's allocation of 10,000 yuan to continue running the school. The old marshal resumed his post as president. There were two instances of leaving and returning. The teacher's concern for his alma mater can be seen from this.

(4) The period of late-year writings and Montreux. After the age of seventy-eight, the teacher lived in the Tushanwan Leshantang, writing by the pool and practicing painting again. Those who obtained it at that time regarded it as a treasure. In addition to his brother Meishu, the teacher completed the book Ma's Grammar after the age of fifty, which is the standard of Chinese grammar. After the age of sixty, he wrote Latin Grammar as a textbook for Aurora. After the age of eighty, he wrote Zhi Zhi Qian Shuo, and after the age of ninety, he wrote a sequel to Zhi Zhi Qian Shuo, and also translated the Four Saints' Gospels. After the 918 Incident, the teacher had many words of concern about the times and anger at the world. He entered Beijing in the winter of the 25th year and was selected as a member of the National Government by the Central Government the following year. In the autumn, the Shanghai War broke out and the National Government moved west. The teacher entered Guilin by carriage. Last autumn, the teacher, at the age of ninety-nine, moved to Liangshan. On November 4th of this year, he died without illness, seven and a half months after his centenary birthday. Looking at the teacher's life, he failed to fulfill his ambitions in politics. He assisted Wen Zhong in handling foreign affairs, but the national bank plan failed to materialize. He planned to establish diplomatic relations with China and Korea, but the Grand Yuanjun could not use him. In the fifth year of the Republic, Yuan's imperial system was self-imposed, and the teacher advised against it but did not listen. This is a clear sign. As for running schools, although he suffered setbacks, he persevered and finally succeeded. The length of the alma mater's history and the magnitude of its achievements are all the teacher's gifts. In recent ten years, although the teacher was old and infirm, he never forgot the alma mater he founded. In the autumn of the 19th year, Fudan held the 15th anniversary celebration and traveled far to Jiangwan. In the summer of the 23rd year, the affiliated high school held the 95th birthday celebration. In the spring of the 24th year, the Lixuetang of the affiliated high school was completed, and he came in a carriage to participate in the ceremony. The teacher was rich in emotion and liked to meet with young people. He would respond to requests for calligraphy and would write for several hours without tiring. His outlook on life can be said to be similar to Confucius' "forgetting food when angry, forgetting worries when happy, and not knowing that old age is coming." Recently, when he heard good news in his illness, he was unusually excited, got up to eat, and there was a faint voice of "news, news" in his dying moments. His concern for national affairs and Sun Yat-sen's dying words of "peaceful struggle to save China" have the same meaning. The good news that the teacher was looking forward to is still awaited, and the teacher's success in running education, knowing it spiritually, must be smiling in the white cloud township to today's memorial service, with a hall full of peaches and plums.

### Three Giant Norwegian Ships Scheduled to Leave Shanghai

Taishan and Sanmin Ships Sail South; Titanic Ship Sails to America

Several large, fast, new ships of Norwegian nationality, managed by the British Tianxiang Ocean Shipping Company in this port, with tonnage of more than 12,000 tons, are dedicated to sailing from Shanghai to Los Angeles in New York, USA, and from Shanghai to Hong Kong, Singapore, and other ports. The voyage is very fast, and it takes only 34 days to reach New York from Shanghai and 2 days to reach Hong Kong from Shanghai. The "Taishan" (M/Y "Taishan") will sail to Hong Kong and Singapore on the 17th of this month, and the "Titanic" (M/Y "Titania") will sail to the United States. Furthermore, since the outbreak of the European War, the number of ships here has suddenly decreased, so the cargo loads of export ships are very enthusiastic. The Norwegian merchant Sanmin Steamboat, represented by the Lian Shunhang of this port, runs the Shanghai-Hong Kong coastal route all year round. Due to its accurate and fast schedule, complete passenger facilities, and simple cargo handling procedures, warehouses are set up in various ports. Therefore, cargo owners and passengers are satisfied. It has repeatedly departed fully loaded with passengers and cargo. It is now known that the ship will arrive in Shanghai on the 16th, berth at the Jinliyuan pontoon, and will depart directly to Hong Kong Haifang for the fifth time on the 20th. It is also known that most of the passenger and cargo cabins have been pre-booked, especially for yarn and cloth. The ship has a tonnage of 3,500 tons, a speed of 11 nautical miles, and a passenger capacity of 700.

### Real Estate Transactions Active; Over 10 Million Yuan in Transactions Last Month; Sale of Tongfu Lane Real Estate Not Yet Completed; Owner Asking for Over 1.4 Million Yuan

Real estate transactions in this city have recently become more active. A news item recently reported that a large real estate transaction was concluded in the central district, stating that real estate transactions last month reached about 3.5 million yuan. In fact, the number of transactions last month was more than this, and should be over 10 million yuan. It was also stated that a certain lane on Jing'an Temple Road in the central district has also been sold, with a price of 1.22 million yuan. Reading the reported number of acres clearly refers to Tongfu Lane. Inquiries to lawyer Shen Zhaojiu, who is handling the owner's side of Tongfu Lane, revealed that the sale of the lane's real estate has not yet been completed, because the property is located in the central district and is an extremely good property. The owner's side is unwilling to sell it easily unless they receive a price of more than 1.4 million yuan. According to the previous valuation of real estate in this city by the Bureau, the standard is no longer suitable for current needs. It is heard that there will be a trend of raising and re-evaluating this year. If so, real estate in this city will inevitably become more expensive.

### Rice Shortage in Japan: Assistance from Korea and Taiwan is Likely to be Difficult; Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Regularly Discusses Storage and Stockpiling; Shanghai Rice Prices Will Not Be Affected in the Future

Japan has experienced droughts and floods this year, leading to a poor rice harvest. It is importing rice from abroad, a phenomenon not seen in nearly six years. The western 23 prefectures of Japan, such as Yamaguchi, Hiroshima, and Okayama, have suffered unprecedented crop failures in recent years. The Japanese government has set a maximum rice price of 35.40 yuan. By September, the market price on the exchange had reached around 42 yuan, and people were paying nearly 50 yuan when buying from rice shops. The Japanese government is now trying to import the first batch from Taiwan to regulate the market and has again set a maximum rice price of 38.13 yuan.

Korea and Taiwan also Report Reduced Harvests

However, although the Japanese government has set price limits, rice prices continue to soar. Moreover, harvests in Korea and Taiwan are also lower than in previous years. According to the Japanese government, Korea's actual harvest this year is 13.99 million stones, a decrease of 10.13 million stones compared to last year. Taiwan's first rice crop yielded 4.03 million stones, a decrease of 860,000 stones compared to last year. In the past decade or so, Japan has had to import 8 to 10 million stones of rice from Korea and 4 to 5 million stones from Taiwan each year.

Entrusting Mitsui to Handle Purchases

However, considering the current situation, continued imports from Korea and Taiwan may be difficult. To plan for the future, it is said that Mitsui & Co. has been entrusted to purchase rice from Wuhu, Jiujiang, Changshu, and Changzhou and transport it to North China for storage. This measure will not affect the inland areas. However, the Shanghai area may be affected to some extent if the Japanese side actually carries out this plan.

Rice Industry Associations Purchase in Large Quantities

It is reported that the price of rice in the producing areas is 14 to 15 yuan per stone. Even with transportation costs, expenses, and taxes, the cost per stone is only about 20 yuan. Therefore, the increase in rice market prices is clearly an intentional attempt to raise prices. However, rice price fluctuations have a significant impact on the livelihoods of citizens. Yesterday, a leader in the rice industry revealed that rice industry associations are currently trying to purchase large quantities and establish public warehouses for storage to stabilize public sentiment and lower rice prices. The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association will hold a joint meeting of directors and supervisors today (the 16th) at 3:00 PM to discuss storage and stockpiling matters. The rice industry hopes that the authorities will lead and eliminate public panic about the future food supply.

Large Quantities of Rice from Nanjing and Shanghai Arrive in Shanghai

Recently, due to the active guerilla activities of Chinese troops in various areas, the Japanese side has halved the number of freight cars on both lines since the 8th (a total of 20 cars) to transport soldiers to various locations for reinforcement, resulting in sluggish freight transport. Rice has been affected the most, leading to a sharp increase in rice prices by as much as 2 to 3 yuan in a few days. By yesterday, the freight cars on both lines had returned to normal, and 10 additional cars were temporarily added due to excessive accumulation of goods at various stations. As a result, a large batch of rice from the interior arrived in port, totaling 6,000 stones, mostly high-quality white rice from Tongli and Kunshan. However, indica rice was in short supply. Public sentiment calmed down, and demand decreased accordingly, with few transactions. Except for a slight drop in the price of indica rice, the prices of all other varieties fell by more than one yuan.

### Armed Chinese Detained; British Troops Have Not Yet Released Them; It is Still Unclear Which Unit They Belong To; They Once Went on a Hunger Strike and Then Resumed Eating

The Mainland News reports that on the morning of Friday the 5th, sixteen people in uniform carrying rifles, pistols, and hand grenades were disarmed and detained by British soldiers of the East Surrey Regiment on Brenan Road. The sixteen people were very dissatisfied with their detention and went on a hunger strike at the end of the week. The incident started on Sunday morning when they told the British soldiers guarding the prison cell that they would not eat unless they were released. The British soldiers did not respond, so they carried out their hunger strike. By lunchtime, the sixteen people still refused to eat, but some of them looked quite haggard. By breakfast on Monday morning, they could no longer endure it, and the 24-hour hunger strike ended. As of last night (the 14th), no one had come to claim them, so they are still being held by the East Surrey Regiment. It is said that both the British troops and the detained people are gradually becoming tired of the situation, but neither side has taken any action regarding their release. The British military authorities have decided to wait a few more days for the sixteen people's masters to come and negotiate and then prepare to handle the case. However, there is some doubt as to whether anyone will claim them. According to the sixteen people, they arrived in Shanghai from Anhui Province ten days ago. However, they also seem to be unaware of who they work for. They were only given uniforms, guns, and hand grenades after arriving in Shanghai and were instructed to patrol the roads. They chose Brenan Road and were subsequently arrested by the East Surrey Regiment. The green uniforms they wore were different from those of the "Great Way" police or so-called "Self-Defense Corps."

### Increasingly Frequent Cargo Transport Between Shanghai and Ningbo

Numerous Junks Gather Outside Zhenhai Port; Fifteen Merchant Ships and Sea Vessels in Total

The shipping route between Shanghai and Ningbo is extremely slow. In the past half month, no ships have returned to Shanghai from Zhenhai. It was not until the day before yesterday that the "Dapu" of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company arrived in Shanghai from Zhenhai. After arriving in Shanghai, the ship entered the dock for annual repairs and will not sail to Zhenhai for the time being. The Norwegian merchant ship "Ningou," which sails to Zhenhai and is loaded with more than 5,000 tons, was chartered by three customs brokers and sailed to Zhenhai yesterday afternoon. It will then load local products from Zhenhai and bring them to Shanghai. This ship is operating on a short-term basis and will withdraw from the Shanghai-Ningbo route after the cargo has been loaded and transported. Junks from six provinces, including Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, are gathering, and joint transportation will soon be implemented. Ningbo is now the only port of entry and exit, so cargo transport has suddenly become very busy recently. Numerous ships are gathered outside Zhenhai Port, including the merchant ships "Xin Xiangtai," "Shili," "Hanna," "Moufou," "Haida," "Deping," "Yongtai," "Xinjiang," "Haifu," "Maile," and the sea vessels "Chuguang," "Haiguang," "Baoguang," "Meinan," etc., totaling fifteen ships.

### Abandoned After Eight Years of Marriage; Came to Shanghai to Find Her Husband and Was Abused; Wife Sues for Living Expenses

Liu Wang, a woman from Hejian, Hebei, residing at No. 241, Xinxin Lane, Jin Shenfu Road, is 45 years old this year. Represented by lawyer Zhou Lianze, she filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the Special Second District Court against her husband, Liu Shuzhi (43 years old, from the same village as Ms. Liu, currently residing at No. 226, Jin Shenfu Road, formerly the owner of the Xinxin Hotel), seeking living expenses. It is claimed that after the plaintiff and defendant married in the sixth year of the Republic of China, the defendant left eight days later on the pretext of seeking a livelihood and never returned for a long time. He then took Li, a concubine, in Qingxian, Hebei. When the plaintiff found out, she rushed to negotiate, but the defendant fled with the concubine. It was not until September of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China that she learned that the defendant and the concubine had opened the Xinxin Hotel in Shanghai. The plaintiff came to Shanghai accompanied by her father, but after only half a month, she returned to her hometown with him. In January of the following year, the plaintiff came to Shanghai alone and lived with the defendant. However, the defendant denied having a wife, and she was repeatedly abused by his concubine. After her elder brother came to Shanghai to mediate, he advised the plaintiff to live separately from the concubine for more than a year, and they lived in peace. However, the defendant, yielding to the concubine's wishes, terminated the lease on the plaintiff's house and stopped providing living expenses. After requesting mediation, her father came to Shanghai again and persuaded the defendant to allow the plaintiff to live with him in the current address at No. 241-5, providing meals and a monthly allowance. Unexpectedly, every time the plaintiff asked for the allowance, she was insulted and scolded by the defendant and his concubine. Starting in May of this year, the allowance was suddenly stopped, and starting on August 24th, meals were also stopped. The defendant's repeated difficulties clearly indicate his intention to put the plaintiff to death, and their relationship has completely broken down. Therefore, she is forced to sue for a judgment ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff living expenses until she reaches the age of 60, for a total of fifteen years and three months, at 30 yuan per month, totaling 5,490 yuan, and to approve a provisional attachment order to facilitate enforcement. The court, based on the complaint, held a hearing in the morning yesterday, presided over by Judge Yu Changzi. Both parties were summoned to the hearing. The plaintiff, accompanied by her lawyer, arrived and recounted the past. The defendant testified that he had never interrupted the plaintiff's meals and that he had always given her an allowance of two or three yuan per month, and he had not stopped giving it. After considering the circumstances, the court instructed both parties to go outside and attempt a reconciliation, and the hearing was adjourned to a later date.

### Owner of Dingyuan Bank Robbed of Huge Sum

Eight Thousand Japanese Yen Robbed; One Thief Arrested on the Spot

The Dingyuan Bank at No. 243 Hankou Road has a branch at No. 287 Peng Road. The owner of the bank, Zhang Yiding, carried 8,000 Japanese yen (equivalent to 10,200 yuan in Chinese currency) from the Peng Road branch in his private car, driven by driver Guo Zixiang, at 8:30 AM yesterday morning, heading to the Dingyuan Bank on Hankou Road. Unexpectedly, when passing the intersection of Renfei Road and Hong Kong Road, two robbers suddenly appeared, one wielding a pistol, blocking the road and ordering them not to make a sound. They robbed all the Japanese yen and fled. One of the robbers, Huang Yicai, carrying a pistol, was reported to the police by Japanese detective Kobayashi and Chinese detective Yang Zhaoqing of the General Police Station when passing the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Beijing Road. They worked with nearby Chinese police to arrest Huang, seizing a pistol and four bullets. Driver Guo Zixiang was also detained as a suspect. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao-yi explained the incident, stating that it was still necessary to investigate the accomplices who were at large and to investigate whether Guo Zixiang was an accomplice. Therefore, he requested permission to adjourn the case. After questioning by Judge Qian Hongye, the two defendants were ordered to be detained and the case was adjourned to a later date.

### Merchants Driven by Greed; Exploitation Through Usurious Rates; Unauthorized Implementation of Bank Credit Loan System; Speculation and Trickery Affecting Social Economy

Fang Rongshi, an employee of the Huadong Company at No. 581 Jing'an Temple Road, is usually good at accumulating wealth and managing his finances, so he has saved up a small amount of money. When the various banks in Shanghai promoted the credit loan system, Fang suddenly had an inspiration and seized the opportunity to use the name of credit loans to lend money at high interest rates. However, because he had not obtained the permission of the government authorities in accordance with the law and had speculatively and cleverly carried out the duties of a bank without authorization, he was criticized by informed people. However, Fang was a good businessman and worked hard to win over customers, and his business was not bad. Since the August 13th Incident, the social financial situation has become tight, and the credit loans of various formal institutions have mostly been put on hold temporarily out of consideration for the borrowers' difficulties. However, Fang had a whimsical idea and suddenly contacted the various debtors separately, using the bait of only seeking to recover the principal and not pursuing interest. As a result, many debtors tightened their belts and worked hard to repay the money. However, after the principal was fully recovered, Fang suddenly changed his attitude and threatened to sue to recover the interest. As a result, most of the debtors had IOUs and were afraid of being sued, so they dared to be angry but dared not speak out, and tried every means to raise money to settle the matter. Little did they know that the debts Fang invested in stated 100 yuan on the face of the note, but only 70 or 80 yuan were actually received. The interest had already exceeded the legal interest rate. Recently, a man named Qiu Xu borrowed 80 yuan on behalf of his friend Shen Yingzhen. After the war, Shen had left Shanghai, so Fang consulted with Qiu and agreed to repay the original amount in monthly installments of 5 yuan. Qiu believed that his friendship with Shen and Fang was deep, and because the IOU was in Qiu's name, he made a special request. Unexpectedly, after the original amount was repaid, Fang demanded interest. Qiu had no choice but to agree to continue repaying 5 yuan per month. Unexpectedly, Fang refused and sued in the First Special District Court. The case is scheduled to be heard today, and Judge Guo Wei will summon the parties. Although the amount involved in this case is small, it has a significant impact on the social economy. It is expected that there will be many interested people in the audience at that time, eager to see what happens.

### Xu Xigeng and His Concubine: Embezzlement and Theft; Keda Pharmaceutical Factory Requests Arrest and Severe Punishment

Wu Zizhen, a native of Yin County, Zhejiang, of the Keda Pharmaceutical Factory at No. 444, Shanhai Pass Road, recently retained lawyer Cheng Zhengping to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court against Xu Xigeng, an employee, and his concubine, Xu Chen, for embezzlement and theft, and to attach a civil lawsuit. The main points of the prosecution are as follows: The defendant, Xu Xigeng, was formerly an employee of the factory. In early April of this year, on the pretext of returning to his hometown for recuperation, he took advantage of the opportunity to steal a cashier's receipt book, Nos. 8910 to 9000, and settlement sheets, etc., and secretly went to Jinhua, Zhejiang. In September of this year, he privately withdrew 13 boxes of Western medicine from the Gongyi Fengji Transportation Company, valued at 4,762.12 yuan in legal tender. After Zhang Bonian recovered some Western medicine worth 1,180.85 yuan from Gongyi, the remaining 3,581.27 yuan was embezzled and used for his own purposes. On August 14 of the same year, he privately collected 297 yuan in payment from the Ningbo Wuzhou Pharmacy, and on July 9, he privately collected 250 yuan from Dongyang Shi Wanchang, totaling 4,128.27 yuan. After the plaintiff learned of this, he sent someone to the Dongya Hotel in Ningbo to confirm that the defendant and his concubine, Xu Chen, had fled Shanghai from Ningbo on August 20 and were hiding in the concession, jointly and continuously embezzling. Although the plaintiff published a warning in the newspaper, they ignored it. They have committed the crime of embezzlement under Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law and the crime of theft under Article 320 of the same law. He requests that they be arrested and severely punished according to the law and that the civil lawsuit be attached, ordering the defendants to jointly and severally compensate 4,128.27 yuan in legal tender. Yesterday morning, this case was heard by Judge Huang Risheng in Criminal Division 3. The defendants did not appear. Lawyer Cheng Zhengping, the plaintiff's agent, stated the reasons for the prosecution and requested an arrest warrant. The court ordered an adjournment for further verification.

### Jin Ying Radio Station Manager Kicks His Son

He was sent to the First Special District Court. The interrogation was adjourned to a later date, pending examination of Huang Renchu's injuries. The hearing continued yesterday afternoon. The victim, Huang Renchu, appeared in court and testified that his injuries had passed the danger period. As long as his father does not abuse him from now on, he is willing to go home with his father. However, he asked the judge to give him legal protection. Judge Qian asked the defendant, Huang Guoping, "Did you hear what your son said?" Huang Guoping replied, "I know. As long as Renchu listens to my instructions, I will never hit him again." After reviewing the testimony, the court adjourned the case for seven days for further hearing.

### Japanese Coal Briquettes Attempted Dumping; Coal Briquettes Lowered in Price to Compete

The Japanese side is dumping various goods in our occupied areas. Recently, the Japanese side shipped back various types of coal, totaling 1,400 to 1,500 tons, and first tried to sell them to coal merchants. Because few people wanted to buy them, the puppet regime came forward and established the Damao Coal Yard and Briquette Factory at Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong, producing more than 100 tons of briquettes per day for dumping in Shanghai. Coal briquette factories in Shanghai announced yesterday that they would lower prices by 4 yuan per ton and 0.3 yuan per load to compete with Japanese goods.

### Letter

To the Editor,
We recently read your newspaper's November 15th edition, Section 3, page 11, which included an article about the three Zhao siblings, Zhao Fengzhang, Zhao Jinkun, and Zhao Xunmei, who were allegedly seduced by their cousin to steal their grandfather's savings account. The article stated that all three siblings were studying at schools such as Shanghai Guang. After investigation, our school does not have any students with these names. This is clearly an error. We hereby request that you correct the record.

Sincerely,
Shanghai Guang Middle School, November 15th

Dear Editor,
I have recently seen a report on the relocation of the warehouse of the Beixin Bookstore in your newspaper of the 10th and 12th, which contains many inaccuracies. Our company previously leased a portion of the building at No. 168 Connaught Road to the Beixin Bookstore. Because the bookstore illegally sublet to other tenants, we sued and obtained a court judgment ordering them to vacate the premises within a specified period. The bookstore repeatedly exceeded the deadline and failed to comply. We then obtained a court eviction order and sent bailiffs several times to enforce the order, and hired workers to move the goods. To this day, the bookstore has not completely vacated the premises. Our company's handling of this matter is completely protected by law, and there has been no illegal action, nor was there any presence of the Xu brothers on the scene. We do not understand how the report could be so different from the facts. We have always admired your newspaper's accurate and detailed reporting, and we hereby submit this letter for clarification and correction. Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Youyi, November 15th

### Cannot Follow the Closing

— Hearing the Song

The language exhibition has already closed. However, the actual language movement is still in its nascent stage, and it cannot "close" with the exhibition. Therefore, in order not to betray the meaning of this exhibition and to cooperate with the development of popular literature produced by the construction of mass literature, we should shoulder the responsibility of actively unfolding this movement.

No one can deny that language is not an antique for decoration, but a real thing; since it is real, it should take the masses as the standard for choice. What suits the masses, we must strive for and develop; what is not suitable for the masses, we must choose and discard; if it is completely wrong, then we can only ask it to avoid; other than that, there is no so-called compromise.

In the past, from Liang Qichao's liberation of classical Chinese to advocating the phonetic alphabet, we certainly cannot ignore its contribution to the language movement, but we cannot say that we have no opinions at all. The most obvious thing is that the spirit of compromising with the old things is too strong, so that in the end, it is still more considerate for the "small number of people" and less considerate for the "masses."

Although the old things have many advantages, they are only a few; and that must also be determined based on the real needs of the masses.

So what do the masses need? That is naturally "language unity." The so-called language unity is really the minimum requirement, and it can no longer be arbitrarily "discounted." Look at the vernacular written in square characters since the May Fourth Movement until today, how many articles can be regarded as truly unified in language? None, none! Why? In a word; it is because they did not think about the masses. What can be regarded as truly unified in language and can be accepted by the masses should be simple, reasonable, easy, universal and suitable for the needs of modern science. Regarding this, it seems that only the mass language constructed by the Latinized New Script can cope with it, because the New Script is a living script, so it is perfectly suitable for the living masses.

Now that we have this new script as the goal of the language movement, then we can do it without hesitation. However, some enthusiasts feel heartbroken, thinking that doing so betrays the history of Chinese characters too much and also obliterates its artistic value. In fact, this is too much of a misunderstanding of the principles of social evolution. Although the history of Chinese characters is very long, it is not immutable. For example, the transformation of ancient Zhou script into seal script, and the transformation of seal script into regular script, are they not all changes? This is just a commonplace. The current promotion of the new script is also a necessary phenomenon in the evolution of writing, so why look at it differently? Moreover, the promotion of this new script is purely for the sake of the masses.

Do it, let's promote the new script that considers the masses! If there is a language exhibition in a few days, I hope that there will be ten or a hundred times more achievements presented to everyone.

Really, the language movement cannot close with the exhibition, because the world is constantly progressing—not wrong! My nonsense.

### Two Girls — Picking up Memories from the Ashes of the Disaster —

— Tang Wei

It was just the end of September, and on the streets of Harbin, thin clothes could hardly withstand the cold wind.

I pulled up the collar of my suit, put my hands in my trouser pockets, and squeezed my ribs with my arms. This walking posture may not be very spirited, so even the beggars on the side of the road didn't pay me any attention.

It took me two full hours to run from where I lived to the West Eight Market. By the time I found the reserved room number, the sun had already left no trace of light in the universe.

This was a house very close to the suburbs. Except for the road facing it and a few identical small rooms on the left, the north and west sides were a vast prairie.

I gently knocked on the door a few times, and an old Russian woman with white hair peeked out from inside. She just glanced at me and withdrew. Then there was a sound of leather shoes, and Pan ran out first, grabbing one of my hands.

"Have you recovered? Still coughing?" she asked.

"Still a little coughing!"

We came in, and a fair-skinned woman with a pair of round, big eyes stood facing us; compared to Pan's skin color, it simply made people doubt that they were not of the same ethnicity.

"My classmate Xu! This is where she lives." Pan introduced me.

I had seen Xu at a friend's banquet before, so she was a little surprised to see me today.

"I really didn't expect that the Mr. Liang that Pan mentioned was actually Mr. Tang."

She smiled charmingly.

"We met once at a friend's treat!" I explained to Pan.

The room was not very spacious, and with the large wardrobe in the corner of the wall, there was even less space; a wooden bed and a not-so-large desk were placed under the window. The bed sheets were dazzlingly white, and two photos were hung diagonally on the gray walls, which looked very elegant and compact.

Pan talked about what had happened in the past two months and the living conditions of the brothers in the mountains. In her conversation, I heard many exciting stories; at the same time, I also heard about the sacrifices of two friends and the injury of one friend.

"The biggest difficulty in the team is the lack of medicine." she stubbornly said.

"Some medicines have already been prepared; are there many wounded now?"

"There are nine people in total. If the medicines don't arrive, at least five people are in danger!" "Besides medicine, do you have any other missions this time?"

"The main thing is medicine; the other thing is to bring you the letter of condolences from Captain Sun and the friends in the headquarters!"

"I'm really ashamed. Everyone is desperately fighting in the hail of bullets, and I'm comfortably squatting on the streets of Harbin. How can I deserve everyone's condolences."

She handed me three or four letters together, and I shyly tore them open to read; while we were talking, I didn't notice when Xu went out. After I finished reading the letter, she bought bread, sausage, and a box of more polite Western snacks.

"Maybe Mr. Tang..." She quickly changed her words and said; "Or Mr. Liang hasn't eaten dinner yet, please have some snacks!"

She politely opened the snack box.

"This is too extravagant!"

"It's okay to have a little."

Pan didn't like snacks very much. She pinched a thick piece of bread crust and continued talking while eating;

"At the end of last month, the river overflowed its banks. The team was living in Changfa Village. In the middle of the night, they heard the sound of water. In less than ten minutes, the water had already reached their necks; hundreds of soldiers and civilians ran through the mud to Yuema Ridge; damn it, they ran into Li Xisan's men, and if it wasn't for Yu Sipao's (Note) relief, they would have had to fight to the death this time!"

She took a few bites of bread one after another, and then stuffed a piece of dried sausage.

Xu seemed to be unable to stand it, and persuaded her from the side!

"Eat slowly, dry crusts are not easy to digest!"

Pan didn't seem to pay much attention to her warning; she continued to talk;

"As a result, they gave us four hundred bullets, and the brothers asked them for two packs of cigarettes..."

"Are you living with Miss Xu today?"

"Yes, I'm living with Xu!"...

Finally, we decided on the method of carrying the medicines and arranged to see her again tomorrow morning.

When I returned, it was almost midnight, and the wind almost penetrated my bones. Two completely different girls were trembling in my mind like a bundle of fire.

### Grass under the Lamp

— Lan Wen

Ancient City

There was news about that ancient city in the newspaper again. After reading it in one breath, I couldn't calm down a bit. So I folded up the newspaper.

The ancient city always evokes a line of fantasy in me, in the old days.

The sunset glow burns half the sky red. Wouldn't it be "infinitely good" to stroll on the city wall? (It's a pity it's just near dusk.) If there is someone walking beside you, you may even forget the time for dinner.

Looking at the ancient city, maybe there will be a gorgeous ancient dream?

But some people have complained about it in the past, didn't they just separate the petitioning team for the sake of a city?

Now, they say they want to demolish the city. Are you indignant?

If you know how to use silence to replace words, you should also know how to use action to vent your anger.

I opened the newspaper again, and I was looking for news of the ancient city's roar.

Traveler

Floating across the sea, the traveler returned from a distant place, where there is an unfree cage, and the devil's hand strangles people's throats, and no one has the freedom to breathe.

But, what about here? When the ship docked, the traveler was melancholy. "Crows all over the world are generally black", "Where is the pure land"? The beacon fire has gone far away, and the light has long followed.

It is the era of beacon fire, it is the years without laughter. Traveler, are you tired of trekking? Or are you tormented by some small misfortunes?

Don't play the song of weariness; you have to beat a war drum. Join the ranks of battle.

### Night Thoughts

— Xiao Xing

A small mountain stands alone, the lonely flowing water, the days are melancholic!

Golden dreams, purple dreams, dance gracefully, and finally hit the small nail of reality, shattered, extinguished. As a result, the whole world suddenly changed its appearance, and depression struck like a small snake, stubbornly wriggling in the body.

I envy the broad-shouldered man, and I admire even more the person with a strong heart; but I am so fragile that I am pitiful. (I remember thin ice, and a finger can poke a hole in it.)

The years pass silently, accompanied by the faint smoke from the roofs of people's houses. I have always locked myself in the house. Will the breath of the fields make me refreshed? Will the tempering of wind and rain make me stronger? It's time to go out. (In the vast night, I may be going on a long journey, greeting a greeting.)

"What are you thinking about? This year, this day." A friend who visited during the day asked. I am used to thinking, imitating the meditation of philosophers, and torturing that young life with bitter thoughts all day long. But, I didn't answer her words, I just smiled faintly.

The light yellow light drew a small circle, and my thoughts were also locked in this small world. "This year, this day" The short six words whipped fiercely. I, a little dizzy, I can't say that weight. However, I don't feel powerless about tomorrow." I know; "to live on".

Since we have lost our way, we can still bravely run forward; after any disappointment, we will not let the cry of the young conscience subside, and we will always find a broad road. I have such conviction.

### Struggle

— Written by A.H. Olough, translated by Pinpin

Don't say that, struggle is ineffective,

Work and trauma are even more in vain,

The enemy will not retreat and will not be defeated,

Everything will not change.

If hope is the deceived, fear is the deceiver;

Look, in the hazy clouds on the horizon,

Your comrades are still chasing flying birds,

And you are standing still.

The tired waves sway in vain,

Like there is nowhere to flow,

But far away, through the stream, make an outlet,

The sea comes serenely.

Not only by the eastern window,

When the light of dawn shines brightly

When slowly climbing into the sky,

It is the West, look, the earth is also shining.

### A Humble Opinion on Improving Peking Opera

— Sick Dove

The decline of Peking Opera is an undeniable fact. The times can best determine everything in society. The modern mission of drama is the reflection of real life, not just the unchanged performance of history in the past. At the same time, every art contains the vitality of the author, whether it is an actor or a playwright. The meaning of old wine in new bottles is to use the existing form and attach completely new content. The script must be popular, because popularization itself is a very important part of the enlightenment movement; and the popularization of old wine in new bottles is a point worthy of attention in the issue of popularization. Undoubtedly, what the public's spirit is daily and likes to approach is the set of old-fashioned things. This old-fashioned thing contains countless feudal remnants and is unwilling to let go; therefore, injecting new content into the old-fashioned style is a good way to speed up the burial of old ideas in the remaining minds.

As for the method of improvement, the author's meaning is to adopt a gradual approach. Because Peking Opera has a solid history of hundreds of years, and the performance method has a deep-rooted impression in the minds of the audience. For example, "Liang Hongyu", "Fisherman's Hate", and "Peach Blossom Fan" directed by Ouyang Yuqian in the past were all very meaningful, but from a business perspective, they were obviously failures. The key to their failure is undoubtedly that the method of improvement was too radical, too poetic, and could not be harmonized with the entire stage personnel. The ordinary audience of the petty bourgeoisie could not help but be disappointed.

The biggest shortcomings of Peking Opera are the lack of contemporary scripts and profound and clear dialogues, and the performance method is also quite insufficient, but it is easy for the audience to accept. In order to continue its survival, it is necessary to fill it with various novel techniques. The current problem is to see who can shoulder this mission during this transition period.

The author is a loyal comrade of Peking Opera. In view of the trend of the great era, I feel that the old Peking Opera can no longer stick to the old ways. Therefore, I don't dare to show my clumsiness and briefly express my humble opinions for reference in arrangement.

### Wang Yurong's "Reading Problem"

— Bai Ping

I recall when Wang Yurong was a singer in Nanjing, the issue of reading caused a sensation in society. I will now describe the process to give readers a smile. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, Wang Yurong was still a singer at the Feilongge Tea House in Nanjing Confucius Temple. Every time the lanterns were lit and she swayed onto the stage, the price she received was extremely limited. At that time, I was editing the news section of the Nanjing Evening News. One day, I received a news draft saying that a singer named Wang Yurong had changed her name to study at Jinghua Middle School in Beijing and was discovered by the school authorities and was often expelled. At that time, my brother Jia Huijian was editing the Qinhuaiyue section of the Nanjing Evening News. When he saw this news item, he was furious and said, "Why can't a singer study? In the autocratic era, it was possible that actors and prostitutes could not enter school. In modern Western countries, opera singers are regarded as noble arts. This kind of feudal thinking really needs to be criticized." So he first published an article to promote attention from people in society. All the newspapers in Beijing saw it and expressed their sympathy and responded one after another. At that time, the reporters stationed in Beijing from the Shanghai newspapers selected the most wonderful sentences from the newspapers' comments and sent them as special telegrams, because whether a singer could study or not had become a major issue in society.

At that time, Nanjing Jinghua Middle School was privately established by Chuan Kuanglin from Sichuan. Seeing that the attacks from the newspapers were very fierce, he entertained reporters and made a great speech, saying that when Wang Yurong came to the school to study, he did not know that she was a singer at first. He only saw that she had permed hair, exposed big legs, and wore glamorous clothes, which were quite seductive. Later, he went to Confucius Temple for social events and learned that this student was Wang Yurong, a singer. In order to rectify the school spirit, it was necessary to expel her. At that time, the Social Affairs Bureau believed that Chuan's handling was appropriate, and Wang Yurong could only sacrifice her desire to study and the tuition fees she paid. What she gained was only the sympathy of the public opinion circle.

Soon, Yurong suddenly disappeared from the Qinhuai River. I don't know where she went. Someone asked her sister Wang Yuqin, who was also a singer at Confucius Temple. According to her, her sister really had the ambition to study and was not hypocritical. After being expelled from the school, she often sobbed at home and was depressed. Now that she saw that she could not realize her wish to study, she decided to go north to Tianjin and Peking, and seek in-depth training from famous teachers, hoping to become a famous actor. In a few years, I saw in the newspaper that Yurong had performed in a famous garden in Peking and was quite popular. This time, she was invited by Huang Jin to go south to continue performing, and she became famous in one fell swoop. As the saying goes, "Where there is a will, there is a way." And her spirit of aspiring to study, persevering and struggling is really commendable.

When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, I went to Shanghai and made a living by writing books. I often saw her sister Yuqin buying groceries at a South goods store around Huaihai Road. Sometimes she held a baby in her arms, presumably she was married and was a housewife. Compared with her sister, she was really insignificant.

### Introducing "Hong Kong Singing Girl"

— Gu Fen

The plot of "Hong Kong Singing Girl" tells the pitiful life of a singing girl. It especially inserts a little more love component than "Elastic Daughter". Lu Ming's performance is indeed quite impressive. What is worth mentioning about this film is the addition of many newcomers. The director is Sun Jing. It is his first time directing a film, and his technique is very clear. Yu Lin, Yue Lin, Yan Hua, and Cao E all did a very good job.

After watching this film, we have a feeling that many of those pitiful people in the pink-collar profession group who lack reason are willing to be playthings for those so-called rich old men to flirt and have fun, which is really lamentable? After "Hong Kong Singing Girl", we believe that at least some people will be moved by it and change their outlook on life. Therefore, we are willing to introduce this work to women in social occasions.

### Chinese "Nora" on stage

The "Women's Liberation" sponsored by the Young Women's Association and performed by the Haiyan Drama Club is Ibsen's original work "Nora". In order to suit the performance at this time and place, it was adapted and Chineseized by Yi Qiao. The play is a world-famous masterpiece and has a long-standing reputation in China. There is no need to repeat it. It is now scheduled to be performed at the evening show this Friday, the matinee on Saturday and Sunday, and the evening show on Sunday (only three shows) in the auditorium of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association. It is also heard that a preview will be held at 9:00 am on Friday to entertain criticism from all walks of life.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Most dramas are at odds with official history. According to my Xu Zhi book, Zhou Shi was a man from Fengshan, Suining. The Yuji Temple built on the top of the mountain still exists today. Extremely detailed murals are painted on both sides of the gate, depicting Yuji's battle map. Lady Zhou was also brave and good at fighting, unlike in the drama, where she only drew her sword and committed suicide, which led to the submersion of Lady Zhou's martial strategy. It is also said that Yuji had another son who escaped, which is the so-called "loyal and good people will not have no descendants". In a corner of Fengshan, the Zhou family has a large number of descendants, who are probably Yuji's descendants. In the early years of the Republic of China, Zhang Xun was stationed in Xucheng and arrested and killed revolutionary party members, which was heard every day. A Mr. Zhou Zhongmu was a member of the old Tongmenghui and was teaching at the Seventh Normal School in the city. He often instilled revolutionary ideas in his students. Later, someone secretly reported to Bian Shuai and Zhou was arrested. After Zhou Peizhang, he denounced the crimes of the warlords without the slightest fear. In a few days, he was shot by Zhang. Before his death, he sat cross-legged and was calm. His scholarship and morality were respected by the villagers. Only after his death did they know that Mr. Zhou was also a descendant of Yuji. His heroic behavior was enough to be compared with his ancestor. I think if the "Ningwu Pass" drama can be adapted and performed in Peking Opera, scenes such as the lady's street battle can be added, which can be played by a martial actress, and it will be even more exciting.

Old actors rely on patience to eat, new artists rely on support to make money

It is commonly said that "old people and yellowed pearls are worthless," but who knows that Wang Lao's worship of Yao Qing has turned out to be a great success. This time, the Golden Authority originally intended to have Wang Yurong take over the team after De Zhu, but because Yao Qing accompanied her beloved apprentice to the south, it caused the attention of various newspapers, who competed to promote it in advance, so Yurong's value also increased invisibly.

— Thin Wren

He did not fail to stand tall with his six-foot body, and the mandarin ducks died together as loyal ministers. Sun San ascended to immortality today, laughing loudly and weeping ghosts and gods.

Righteous courage and loyalty came from the narrow alley, only knowing the country but not the family. Seeing her chew off her clove tongue, ten thousand ages will always bloom with blue blood flowers.
