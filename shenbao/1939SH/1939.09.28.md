### German Foreign Minister Re-visits Moscow: Consultations on Military and Diplomatic Issues; Soviet Influence Extends Towards the Baltic Sea, Pressuring Estonia to Conclude a Broad Political Agreement

Moscow: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, at the invitation of the Soviet government, arrived here by plane today. He will hold consultations with the Soviet government on various issues related to the Polish situation. (TASS dispatch, 27th)

Berlin: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, at the invitation of the Soviet government, departed from Tempelhof Airport at 9:00 this morning on the "Grenzmark" aircraft for Moscow. He was accompanied by the Soviet Ambassador to Germany, Shkvartsev, the embassy secretary Pavlov, and several of Ribbentrop's staff. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)

London: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, accompanied by the Soviet Ambassador to Germany and 36 others, departed from Berlin by plane at 9:00 this morning for Moscow. It is reported that leader Butz also among them. They arrived in Königsberg at 11:15 a.m., stopping briefly before continuing to Moscow. They are expected to arrive at Moscow's civilian airport at 6:00 p.m. today. It is unlikely that any talks will begin before tomorrow, as the Turkish delegation is also in Moscow. The Turkish delegation will leave Moscow tomorrow. Diplomatic circles in the Soviet capital believe that Ribbentrop's visit to the Soviet Union is not only about the Polish situation but must also involve other important issues, such as a Soviet-German military alliance or jointly preventing Turkey from joining the Anglo-French bloc. London newspapers are refraining from making hasty speculations about the significance of the German Foreign Minister's visit to Moscow. Some observers fear that another diplomatic bombshell is brewing, while others believe that Stalin's suspicion of Hitler is no less than that of Britain and France, and find solace in this. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Berlin: Since the announcement of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Moscow, Berlin residents have been paying close attention. Because the German-Soviet treaty stipulates the obligation for both countries to discuss issues of common interest, the general public is not surprised by the German Foreign Minister's visit. Furthermore, after the collapse of Poland, it is necessary to consider the future fate of its territory. According to political figures, the dividing line between Germany and the Soviet Union only demarcates the areas that the German and Soviet armies should immediately occupy and should not be regarded as the final border. Many believe that Ribbentrop will use the opportunity of his visit to Moscow to discuss other diplomatic issues with the Soviet government, including the aggressive war of Britain and France on the Western Front, and the issues raised by the visits of the foreign ministers of Estonia and Turkey to Moscow. Due to the special nature of this visit, no procedures can be stipulated. No information has been obtained regarding the duration of Ribbentrop's stay in the Soviet Union. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)

Moscow: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to arrive here before tomorrow. Foreign observers have generally stated that this is the second time Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has been invited since August 23rd, but Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and even Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin have not reciprocated. Furthermore, after Estonian Foreign Minister Selter visited here once before, he suddenly returned to his country to attend an emergency cabinet meeting. It is now reported that he has come to Moscow for the second time. It is generally believed that Germany is very concerned about the Soviet Union's intentions towards Estonia. Therefore, Ribbentrop's second invitation is probably related to the Estonian issue. In addition, the Soviet troops in Poland are now gradually approaching the border line set by Germany and the Soviet Union, and they should construct defensive public works along this line to strengthen the Soviet Union's position vis-à-vis Germany. According to diplomatic sources here, under these circumstances, it is in Germany's interest to resolve the Polish issue as soon as possible; otherwise, the Soviet Union may continue to make demands on Germany based on its newly created advantage. For this reason, foreign observers believe that before German leader Hitler proposes a peace agreement to Britain and France, he may wish to first establish an alliance treaty with the Soviet Union so that Germany can have no worries about the future if Britain and France refuse the peace agreement. Furthermore, with Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu here negotiating with Molotov, Ribbentrop's sudden visit to the Soviet Union may be intended to influence these negotiations and encourage the Soviet Union to pressure Turkey to distance itself from the Western European democracies. This is also possible. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Moscow: Estonian Foreign Minister Selter arrived here again at 5:30 p.m. today by plane from the capital of his country. In addition to the country's envoy August, two jurists accompanied him, one being the speaker of the country's parliament and the dean of the Law Faculty, Uluots, and the other being Professor Piip, an expert in international law. It is said that after arriving here, they will sign an agreement with the Soviet authorities to dispel Soviet concerns about Estonia's neutrality. As for the extent to which the country's independent status can be maintained, nothing has been heard. What is known is that the issue of "foreign submarines appearing in the Baltic Sea" is no longer being discussed. According to some sources, the German naval attaché to the Soviet embassy went to the capital of Estonia yesterday. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Denmark: According to the "Political News," the Estonian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Selter, is scheduled to fly to Moscow today. The Soviet Union has requested Estonia to sign a new trade agreement and use a port in the Baltic Sea, probably Vosel or Baltiyskiy, as a naval base. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Lithuanian Capital: Regarding Estonian Foreign Minister Selter's sudden departure from the city and the country's Prime Minister's upcoming visit to Moscow, it has been learned here that the Soviet Russian government wants to conclude a broad political and economic agreement with Estonia, one of the clauses of which is that Soviet Russia demands the establishment of a free port area in Estonian ports, where Soviet Russia can station troops to protect Soviet Russian interests. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)

Moscow: After Estonian Foreign Minister Selter came here the other day and had a meeting with Foreign Minister Molotov, he suddenly returned home. Then, the country's envoy to Soviet Russia, Leo August, returned to his country this morning. It is said that this trip is intended to accelerate the current negotiations between the two sides. Foreign observers say that Foreign Minister Selter's visit is just like the visit of Czech President Hácha to Berchtesgaden, Germany, in March of this year to accept German demands. It is rumored that Molotov made several demands on Selter, the nature of which is like an ultimatum. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Rome: According to reliable sources received here, the reason for Estonian Foreign Minister's sudden visit to Moscow is that the Soviet Union demanded that Estonia immediately disarm the armaments and batteries on three islands in Finland. It is said that these three islands are geographically sufficient to control the throat of Leningrad, so their armament is deeply resented by the Soviet Union. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

Finnish Capital: Although official sources here believe that the news that the Soviet Union is about to protest against the armament plan of the Åland Islands is a rumor and is not credible, neutral sources say that the Soviet Union's influence in the Baltic Sea has recently increased significantly. At the same time, the Åland Islands hold a pivotal position in the Baltic Sea war, so the Soviet Union's demand for a solution to this issue may not be far away. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

London: According to news here today, the Soviet government has obtained the consent of the German government to include the Eastern Balkan countries within the Soviet sphere of influence, causing concern among all circles about the fate of Estonia, Romania, and Bulgaria. According to news from Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, Foreign Minister Selter will travel to Moscow again on Wednesday to discuss the "tense relations" between the Soviet Union and Estonia with the Soviet side. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

Turkish Foreign Minister Stays in the Soviet Capital: Talks Between the Two Sides Are Very Harmonious

Moscow: Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union Molotov received Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu at the Kremlin yesterday. The guests included the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Yakgun, Soviet Deputy People's Commissars for Foreign Affairs Potemkin and Dekanozov, and the Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Terentiev. Afterwards, Saracoğlu, accompanied by the Turkish Ambassador, met with the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Kalinin. The Secretary of the Presidium, Gorkin, and the Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Terentiev, were also present. On the same day, Molotov invited Saracoğlu and his entourage and members of the Turkish Embassy to lunch. Among the Soviet dignitaries present were Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Potemkin, Dekanozov, Lozovsky, Gorkin, and Terentiev. During the luncheon, Molotov and Saracoğlu exchanged toasts. (TASS dispatch, 27th)

Moscow: The Turkish Embassy in the Soviet Union hosted a banquet this afternoon to welcome Foreign Minister Saracoğlu. Also present were Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Defense Commissar Voroshilov, and many senior officials of the Foreign Commissariat. It is reported that after Saracoğlu's arrival here, he had three meetings with Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday afternoon and evening. The progress was reportedly very good. Foreign Minister Saracoğlu was originally scheduled to return home tomorrow evening, but because German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, at the invitation of the Soviet government, is scheduled to arrive here today to resolve "various issues arising from the Polish situation," Soviet and Turkish ministers will not have time to hold talks tomorrow, and Saracoğlu's return date has had to be postponed. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

No Rift in Soviet-Romanian Relations: Maintaining Neutrality as the Basis

Rome: Rumors that relations between the Soviet Union and Romania are strained, and that Soviet troops arriving near the Romanian border have had many disputes with Romanian border guards, have been denied by officials here, who describe them as pure fabrications. They say that border traffic between the Soviet Union and Romania is normal, and that relations between the two countries are based on a policy of neutrality, with no rift between them. Soviet military authorities on the southern border of Poland are particularly capable of maintaining a completely neutral attitude towards Romania. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Rome: It is reported that the Soviet Union has reaffirmed its guarantee to respect Romanian neutrality. Official and unofficial circles have expressed surprise at the rumors that the Soviet Union will make changes in Bessarabia (formerly part of Russia and ceded to Romania after the European War). The Soviet Union has recently been building fortifications along the Dniester River border and increasing its troops there, and Romania has also increased its troops to defend Bessarabia and is also building defenses on the Romanian side of the Dniester River. However, officials have expressed the hope that the Soviet Union will not have any malicious intentions. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Soviet Troops Deployed on the Border; Tensions in Soviet-Estonian Relations; The Soviet Union Attaches Importance to the Escape of the Polish Submarine; Still Not Satisfied with Estonia's Explanation

Moscow: The local radio station broadcast a message last night, stating that Soviet troops have been concentrated on the Estonian border, so the Northern Russian Red Army has been adapted to wartime organization. Also, according to the official radio station, the Soviet fleet is cruising between Russia and Finland, and the fleet in the White Sea has also "gained new functions due to the environment." (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

Moscow: Regarding the escape of a Polish submarine from the port of Tallinn, Estonia, the Soviet government is not satisfied with the explanation made by the Estonian government and insists that this submarine has entered the Gulf of Finland after being repaired in the Estonian port. Therefore, the situation between the Soviet Union and Estonia has become serious. Estonian Foreign Minister Selter's visit here is precisely for this reason. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Moscow: TASS released a communiqué today regarding the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Estonia as follows:

"Regarding the escape of a Polish submarine detained in the port of Tallinn, the explanation given by the Estonian government is not satisfactory. Therefore, the Soviet Union and Estonia are engaged in negotiations to determine steps to ensure the security of Soviet territorial waters and prevent the activities of foreign submarines hiding in the Baltic Sea. According to the Estonian government, when the aforementioned Polish submarine entered Estonian territorial waters, 'its machinery was damaged and its movements were not flexible.' If this is the case, it is difficult to understand how a submarine so damaged could have escaped the eyes and ears of the guards and escaped from the capital's port. Accordingly, it is highly likely that the submarine was completely repaired and refueled in the port of Tallinn so that it could escape on its own.

"Furthermore, according to news from Leningrad, periscopes of submarines of unknown nationality were found in two places in Luga Bay today. From this, it can be concluded that there must be a secret base for submarines of unknown nationality somewhere near the Estonian coast. Taken together, the problem of ensuring the security of Soviet territorial waters and preventing the activities of submarines is very important." (TASS dispatch, 28th)

Berlin: According to a broadcast report from Moscow received here, regarding the Estonian ship "Osel," the Soviet Union has issued an ultimatum to Estonia. However, the German Foreign Ministry and the Propaganda Department have denied knowledge of this news. It is reported that the Polish submarine "Osel" entered the port of Tallinn, Estonia, for repairs. According to Swedish sources, it escaped a week ago under the escort of two Estonian soldiers and sailed to the Swedish coast, where the two Estonian soldiers were released in a small boat. However, according to the Estonian side, the Estonian soldiers fired at the submarine when it escaped, but it soon submerged into the water. Although airplanes, warships, and speedboats were dispatched to pursue and attack it, all were unsuccessful. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

Port of Tallinn, Estonia: The Commander-in-Chief of the Estonian Army stated in a radio broadcast yesterday that if Estonia is attacked by another country, it will resolutely stand up and fight to maintain Estonia's independence. Estonia does not want to be involved in this European war, but if another country attacks Estonia, Estonia will have to fight it, just as it did twenty years ago. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

Capital of Latvia: Due to the suspension of Soviet-Estonian business negotiations, the Estonian government held a meeting yesterday afternoon in the capital of Estonia, chaired by President Pads. Estonian Foreign Minister Selter also presented a report to the joint meeting of the two houses of parliament, but the content has not yet been announced. According to official statements, Foreign Minister Selter, along with Estonian Envoy to the Soviet Union Rae and Professors Uluots and Piip of the International Political Committee, are scheduled to travel to Moscow today to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union. Rumors that the negotiations were suspended due to the issue of Soviet transit trade through the capital of Estonia seem to have been confirmed. The official hope is to formally announce the truth today. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)

### Germany Prepares to Launch a Peace Offensive Against Britain and France; If Rejected Again, It Will Not Hesitate to Fight, Claiming to Have Weapons to Win

Basel, Switzerland: The Berlin correspondent of the "National Daily" cabled that "German officials say that Germany will launch a 'peace offensive' within three days. The current question is whether Germany can make peace with Britain and France or whether it must implement a main force war on the Western Front. Although Germany does not want a long-term war, if Britain and France are determined not to make peace, it will have to deal with it with all its strength. The German side urgently wants to obtain an answer to this question," etc.

(Havas dispatch, 27th)

The Hague: The Rotterdam Daily recently published news from Berlin stating that semi-official German sources and the press are saying that if the peace proposals that Germany can put forward are rejected, it will fight Britain with all its strength, without any scruples. The country's newspapers also stated, "Germany has a weapon that has not yet been used. Once it is forced to do so, it will use it. Its destructive power is very great and sufficient to achieve a decisive effect." This so-called weapon may refer to a newly invented poison gas bomb, but it is not yet known. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Brussels: German newspapers have recently published news, often saying that Belgium will launch a diplomatic initiative in the hope of restoring peace in Europe. Political figures here have commented on this, saying that according to Dutch newspapers, German leader Hitler may often propose peace agreements to Western European democracies in a short period of time, based on the current situation, but there is absolutely no hope of accepting these agreements. Therefore, what the German newspapers say about how Belgium will do this and that is probably just a probing nature. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

German Foreign Minister's Visit to the Soviet Union

British Newspapers Speculate

London: Regarding German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's second visit to Moscow, British newspapers are very surprised. What is the truth behind it? Too many newspapers put forward two explanations. One says that Germany is very uneasy about the Soviet Union's gradual expansion of its influence into the Balkan Peninsula and therefore urgently wants to reach a compromise with the Soviet government. Another says that this is a strategy of Germany before proposing peace agreements to Britain and France. Judging from the fact that Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu and Ribbentrop arrived in the Soviet Union at the same time, the first statement is not without reason. However, judging from the concentration of German troops on the Western Front, it seems to coincide with the second statement. Which one is true and which one is false is still difficult to say at this moment. The "Daily Mail" wrote, "Certain circles believe that the real goal of Ribbentrop's trip is to discuss with the Soviet authorities a peace plan that can make Britain and France feel satisfied and at the same time preserve Hitler's face. The fate of the Balkan Peninsula countries may also be involved." The "Times" published a report from a correspondent on the Lithuanian border regarding Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Moscow, saying that "Since the implementation of the 'New Axis' policy (referring to the Berlin-Moscow Axis), the German government has been quite disappointed, so it has to postpone various issues in Eastern Europe." The "Daily Express" wrote, "Leader Hitler will launch a peace offensive against us in the near future. He and the important cabinet members have recently been scattered in various places and returned to Berlin yesterday. Today, they gathered at the State Council to hold an important meeting. According to the German government's intentions, it wants to threaten Britain and France to accept the country's proposals, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is rushing to Moscow at the same time as Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu is visiting the Soviet Union, which is also deliberately mystifying, intending to make people believe that Germany, the Soviet Union, and Turkey are plotting to conclude a secret agreement and divide the Balkan Peninsula and the Near East. At the same time, Germany and the Soviet Union intend to divide the Baltic Sea coastal countries. In fact, this peace offensive and the concentration of troops on the Western Front are enough to prove that Germany has reached the end of its rope. "If Germany wants to continue the war, it can only invade Romania and advance towards the Black Sea. "But if Germany takes an offensive on the Western Front now, then its real meaning is that the German military authorities know that the road to the East has been blocked by the Soviet Union, so it has to turn to the West." The "News Chronicle" wrote, "The Soviet Union's attempt to economically control the Balkan Peninsula is becoming increasingly active. This is what Leader Hitler is uneasy about, so he decided to send Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Moscow to try to stop it. Some say that the German side has always believed that after the partitioning of Poland, Stalin intends to put forward peace proposals. This time, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop may be persuading Stalin that the time for putting forward peace proposals has come. However, no matter what, the talks between the Soviet Union and Germany today will have an important impact on the war on the Western Front. It can be asserted that rumors that Germany and the Soviet Union may conclude a military treaty are difficult to realize. The Soviet Union is now pursuing a self-serving policy. It does not feel threatened in any way. Germany is at war with Britain and France, so it has no time to spare. It is not beneficial for the Soviet Union to form a military treaty with it." (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Relations Between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union

German-Soviet Suspicion Unresolved: Britain and France Take Advantage

Capital of Switzerland: The local "New Free Press" recently commented on the relations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, stating that "Britain and France have remained calm about the Soviet Union's entry into Poland and have decided not to sever diplomatic relations with the country. The reason for this is that the Soviet Union's move is enough to force Germany to maintain a significant number of troops in Poland, which is indirectly beneficial to Britain and France. As for the Soviet Union's failure to make demands on Romania's Bessarabia province (formerly part of Russia before the last European War), this may be in return for Britain and France. Britain and France have an obligation to guarantee Romania, the same as their obligation to Poland. If the Soviet Union were to take any action against Romania, Britain and France would have to deal with it. As for the situation in the Baltic Sea, if the Soviet Union takes no action in the Gulf of Finland after Germany occupied the Free City of Danzig and Poland's Port of Gdynia, then Germany will have an advantage in the Baltic Sea and extend its influence to the country, which is not what the Soviet Union wants to hear. However, unless Germany is completely defeated on the Western Front, the Soviet Union will remain dormant and maintain a good-faith neutrality towards Germany to avoid getting caught in the whirlpool and causing a crisis within the country. In short, the Soviet Union does not intend to help Germany, and it does not want to abandon the promotion of communism within the country, waiting for the country to collapse before taking action. Britain and France are not pessimistic about the close relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, but only contain the Bolsheviks within their own countries, which is the reason for this." (Havas dispatch, 27th)

London: Military experts believe that Germany's losses in Poland should not be ignored. According to French observations, the new recruits Germany transferred to the Western Front came from the interior of Germany and certainly not from Poland. Some say that there are 500,000 Soviet troops on the Polish border. If they only want to occupy Russia and Polish Ukraine, then 500,000 troops would be enough, so why suddenly mobilize four million people? The National Socialist Party is deeply concerned about the revival of Pan-Slavism in the Balkans under the guidance of the Communist Party. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Editorial

### The European War and the Destruction of the World Economy

Since Germany declared the end of the Eastern Front war, the European war has entered a new stage. Germany originally hoped that after defeating Poland, Britain and France would lose their objective of fighting Germany. Then, a third party would mediate to achieve a victorious peace. Unexpectedly, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's definition of "localized war and the major war has not yet broken out" was not accepted by Britain and France. Therefore, the war on the Western Front gradually intensified. Judging from the current war situation, France has the Maginot Line, and Germany has the Siegfried Line. Both are strong and defensible. Unless one side is willing to violate the neutrality of other countries, it will not easily gain a deep penetration opportunity. Therefore, a stalemate is inevitable, and a long-term war situation will emerge.

Modern warfare is a comprehensive battle of military, political, and economic forces. Comparing these three forces, in a quick decisive strategy, military and political factors are the most important. However, in a long-term war, the economy is the determining factor. For example, Germany's defeat in the First World War was due to excessive economic poverty. We do not need to speculate on whether the current European war requires a long-term war or whether we can achieve a quick and decisive result from the military and political aspects. However, in terms of economics, countries have indeed begun to engage in long-term warfare. Britain has imposed a naval blockade on Germany and is implementing the interception of wartime prohibited goods. Germany has also implemented a counter-blockade policy using submarines. This method of confrontation started extremely fiercely, comparable to the end of the First World War. Although all parties are currently making boastful statements like "You can't starve me to death," the initial results have actually had a considerable effect. Germany has accused Britain's blockade policy of being an inhumane operation against women and children. British Prime Minister Chamberlain also called on the nation to wage a long-term economic war to resist German submarines. These are all expressions of deeply felt wartime oppression.

How the actual economic activities within Britain, France, and Germany are currently, cannot be known to outsiders because they involve military secrets. However, judging from their foreign trade status, the three countries are all highly developed industrial and commercial nations. Therefore, in foreign trade, imports are mostly food and raw materials, while exports are mostly manufactured goods. This is especially true for Britain and Germany. In the past, the import of raw materials and food by Britain often accounted for about 80% of total imports, and the export of manufactured goods also accounted for about 75% of total exports. The import of raw materials and the export of manufactured goods both account for more than 80% of the total import or export value. Britain and Germany both attach great importance to their overseas commerce. Therefore, destroying the other's overseas commerce is the most important economic strategy. Because of this, the struggle between blockade and counter-blockade will inevitably intensify. The impact will not only be on the participating countries themselves, but even all of humanity will suffer significant consequences.

So far, only Britain, France, Poland, and Germany have participated in the European war. The Soviet Union stopped abruptly after entering Poland and cannot be considered a belligerent. The existing antagonistic attitudes are only between Britain and France and Germany. It is currently difficult to predict whether other countries will join the war in the future. However, based on past facts, economic reasons are often the reason for participation in the war. If the scope of economic warfare between the two sides gradually expands, it will be difficult to avoid other countries joining the war, either voluntarily or passively. Britain, France, Germany, and other countries have recently repeatedly declared and guaranteed the neutrality of neighboring countries, and declared that they will comply with the international laws of war. However, modern guarantees have fundamentally become a way of lying. International law is only an expression of humanitarian justice recognized by the international community, and it does not actually have coercive sanctions. How can this stop the barbaric actions of war? For example, the scope of activity of Germany's submarine policy is not only around Britain, France, and their territories, but even extends to the coasts of Central and South America. Its destruction of maritime transportation is not limited to sinking British and French merchant ships. Even ships from other neutral countries have been repeatedly bombed by them. For example, Britain's interception of wartime prohibited goods requires neutral countries' merchant ships to be inspected by British warships. In addition, there are indirect restrictions on entrepot trade through neutral countries. For example, yesterday Germany issued a warning to all neutral countries, demanding that they suspend commercial relations with Britain and France. The continuous performance of these kinds of struggles will inevitably expand the scope of the European war. This is imaginable.

Regarding the impact of the European economic war on the world economy: Britain, France, and Germany are all countries that occupy a very important position in world trade. In terms of the value of the three countries' own trade in the past, they account for about 30% of world trade. With the difficulty of maritime transportation and the absolute maintenance of neutrality by non-participating countries, it will not only be Britain, France, and Germany that will be hit, but the trade of the whole of Europe and even the world. In the past, the trade volume of Europe accounted for more than 50% of the total world trade. If more than 50% of the world's trade stops operating, this will cause the world to lose the normal relationship between production and consumption. The war will destroy European economic activity, and will naturally also destroy the economic vitality of places outside Europe. Furthermore, its impact will not only be on the present but will extend far into the future. War is already bloodshed and massacre; economic panic will become chronic carnage.

### Warsaw Besieged for Three Weeks, Reduced to Level Ground by Artillery and Airplanes; Defending Soldiers Fought Bravely, Repeatedly Thwarting Powerful Enemies; Berlin War Report Says Defending Soldiers Have Requested Surrender

(London) Yesterday was the 21st day of the siege of Warsaw. In the evening, the city broadcast a radio message, stating that 200 airplanes were constantly bombing, heavy artillery was also bombarding fiercely, German airplanes dropped hundreds of incendiary bombs, causing many fires, most public buildings were burning, firefighters and civilians were bravely putting out the fires, but due to lack of water, the effect was minimal. The food situation is already difficult, especially because of continuous shelling and air raids by the Germans, making it even more inconvenient to distribute food. Hundreds of horses killed by artillery shells in the streets have been slaughtered and divided for food. Furthermore, according to a public statement issued by the Warsaw Garrison Headquarters on the 25th of this month, German airplanes dropped incendiary bombs, causing hundreds of fires, and eight German airplanes have been shot down. Loss of life is incalculable. Warsaw has become a scene of rubble, but the defending soldiers are currently maintaining defenses and repelling the enemy. Modlin is currently surrounded but is still bravely holding out. (Reuter, 27th)

(Berlin) This afternoon, the German High Command announced that since the German army began its fierce attack on Warsaw yesterday, the Polish army's first and second lines of defense have been captured by the German army. Polish generals all knew that the situation was hopeless. This morning, they expressed their willingness to surrender the Warsaw fortress to the German army. The German Commander-in-Chief ordered General Blaskowitz to negotiate the surrender of Warsaw. (Haitong, 27th)

(Berlin) A report received here states that Warsaw surrendered unconditionally at 10:30 this morning. (Haitong, 27th)

### German Troops on Western Front Bombard French Rear; German Reinforcements Arrive in the Rhineland

(Paris) The General Headquarters has just released War Bulletin No. 46, stating that "Last night, enemy artillery, in addition to shelling the city of Wissembourg behind our army, remained generally quiet." (Havas, 27th)

(Paris) The General Headquarters has just released War Bulletin No. 45, stating that "Yesterday, enemy artillery was active in many locations south of the cities of Deux-Ponts and Bitche in the Saar region. Enemy infantry also attempted to attack the banks of the Lauter River at dawn but were repelled by our army." (Havas, 26th)

(Paris) The war on the Western Front continues in the countryside west of Haguenau, connecting the Saar Line and the Haguenau Forest. The nature of the war has not changed, limited to artillery bombardment and local skirmishes. In each engagement, no more than a company of soldiers from either side participates. German artillery fire bombarding the French front has now weakened. Except for the area east of Deux-Ponts, where there is still significant activity, the front is relatively quiet. (Reuter, 27th)

(Copenhagen) A telegram from a political reporter stationed on the German front line states that the German army units that were originally fighting in Poland have now been mostly transferred to the Western Front. Residents of towns near the Siegfried Line, including residents of Aachen, have been almost completely evacuated. The German army is currently constructing fortifications in the Wissembourg area. The army has sufficient supplies, but food for the people is severely restricted. (Havas, 26th)

(Paris) The French General Headquarters is currently studying in detail the German concentration of forces in Aachen and Baden. As a result of French air force reconnaissance deep into German territory, it has been discovered that German reinforcements are now distributed along the Rhine River. These reinforcements, coming from the Eastern Front, are very few in number. (Reuter, 27th)

(Brussels) Socialist Member of Parliament Henri Rolin recently published an article in the newspaper Le Peuple, stating, "Germany is actively constructing defensive fortifications near the city of Aachen. Looking eastward from the Hoeselt customs office on the Belgian border, it is clearly visible. The German side has already built a huge bunker and constructed a tank defense line made of reinforced concrete, painted green." (Havas, 27th)

### Soviet Republic Established in Poland

(Moscow) It is reported that the Soviet government will immediately establish a Polish Soviet Republic in the Soviet-occupied areas of Poland, in accordance with the principles outlined in Stalin's book "Marxism and the National Question," and that Communist Party members from Moscow and Kyiv will replace the Polish authorities in governing, in order to completely eliminate the Polish nation's resistance and traditional spirit. According to Stalin's views, the national question within Poland can only be resolved through revolutionary means, and all national questions are crucial issues in relation to the labor revolution and the labor dictatorship. (Havas, 26th)

### Full Text of Chamberlain's Speech in the House of Commons: Reporting on the Current War Situation

(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain today spoke in the House of Commons, dispelling any hopes abroad that peace might be possible after the conquest of Poland. The Prime Minister stated, "The unity and determination of our people has never been greater than it is today. We are determined to eliminate the constant threat of German aggression once and for all, of which Poland is only the most recent example. This simple fact cannot be stated too often. Our country and France have joined the war specifically to eliminate this threat to ourselves and the world. Our people are now more united than ever before, determined to achieve this goal."

The Prime Minister spoke of the war on the Western Front, saying that French forces have continued to make advances in some areas of the Western Front. Although German reactions have increased, French forces have managed to maintain all their gains.

The Prime Minister, in recalling what he said on September 20 regarding the difficult problems faced by the Romanian government due to the retreat of Polish forces into Romanian territory, stated that the British government, upon hearing the news of the assassination of Romanian Prime Minister Calinescu, has followed the Romanian government's efforts to deal with these difficult problems with sympathy. On September 21, he instructed the British Ambassador to Romania to express to the Romanian government the shock of the British government and people at this atrocity, and their sincere condolences for the loss suffered by Romania.

The Prime Minister spoke of the war against submarines, saying that there have been many recent attacks on German submarines. Since the last war, great progress in the endurance, speed, and reliability of aircraft has enabled the British Air Force to make a very important contribution to the work of searching for and attacking submarines. Coastal patrol work has also greatly helped the navy in defending against the scourge of submarines.

The Prime Minister spoke of the war preparations of the Dominions, saying that these preparations are still actively underway. Dominion warships are currently cooperating with the British fleet, and Dominion armies are also currently in training in order to join the war when the environment requires it. Dominion air forces are currently preparing to serve overseas. As a result of close cooperation, the supply of munitions, food, and raw materials is now flowing from the Dominions to Britain in increasing quantities.

The Prime Minister spoke of civil defense, saying that Britain is at risk of air raids, and that preparations for civil air defense must not be relaxed in the slightest, nor must the scope of civil defense be reduced in the slightest, so as not to weaken Britain's ability to cope with air raids.

The Prime Minister spoke at length about the work of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, saying that, generally speaking, the functions performed by the Ministry of Blockade during the last war will now be exercised by the Ministry of Economic Warfare. The main purpose of this ministry is to disrupt Germany's economic structure to the extent that it cannot continue the war. If Britain can prevent Germany from importing the raw materials necessary for its war industry, it will certainly be able to destroy Germany's ability to wage a long-term war. However, the people of the country should not be overly optimistic, because Germany has accumulated varying amounts of the various raw materials it needs, so the people of the country cannot expect results in the short term. Britain's control at sea can cut off Germany's supply of many raw materials from the start of the war. In the three weeks since the start of the war, Britain has seized 256,000 tons of contraband destined for Germany, including 62,000 tons of oil and 37,000 tons of manganese ore.

German propaganda has been very active, claiming that Britain's contraband interception measures have no impact on Germany and only hinder the trade of neutral countries. This propaganda is extremely false. In fact, at the beginning of the war, we clearly announced that we urgently wanted to take care of the needs of the legitimate trade of neutral countries. The British government is willing to consider any suggestions that neutral governments may offer regarding this matter. Currently, the British government is engaged in friendly discussions with several governments. The British government hopes that in some matters, it can establish measures that will simplify contraband management procedures. These facts speak louder than words. I believe that the public opinion of neutral countries will definitely compare Britain's clearly announced policy with Germany's threats to neutral countries that harbor sinister intentions. These German threats have materialized in recent days, such as the sinking of three neutral merchant ships in an environment that clearly violates international law. Germany has recently been promoting the idea of listing food as conditional contraband and criticizing Britain for carrying out an illegal and inhumane blockade. It should be known that naval blockade and land siege are no different. Can the commander besieging the enemy allow food to freely enter the besieged city? In any case, Germany cannot make this kind of accusation when its submarines are attacking ships sailing to Britain, regardless of humanity and the submarine warfare regulations that it previously solemnly acknowledged.

If Britain wants to develop its greatest efforts, the support of both labor and management is essential. The authorities responsible for the machinery industry are now planning to expand the supply of labor. This initiative is particularly inspiring. The trade unions have also agreed to lift their original conditions under appropriate safeguards. This move has spared the government the difficulties of the last war and is a contribution that the entire country appreciates. (Reuter, 26th)

### Twenty German Airplanes Bomb British Fleet

(London) First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill stated in the House of Commons this afternoon, "A squadron of our battleships, an aircraft carrier, and several cruisers and destroyers were attacked by approximately 20 German airplanes in the central North Sea yesterday afternoon but suffered no damage or casualties."

According to a message from the German High Command in Berlin today, "Several German bombers suddenly attacked the British fleet in the North Sea yesterday, including several battleships, an aircraft carrier, and several cruisers and destroyers. As a result, one aircraft carrier and one battleship were destroyed." It is reported that the German aircraft returned to their rear bases after completing their mission without any losses.

### Churchill Announces Success in Countering German Submarines; Says German Submarine Commanders Still Considerate of Humanity; Opposition Parties Advocate Swift Prevention of Crisis

(London) British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill today described the British Navy's extraordinary efforts to counter German submarines in the House of Commons, saying that Britain's response to submarine attacks is, firstly, the implementation of a convoy system, and secondly, the equipment of all merchant ships and fast mail ships with armaments to defend against submarines and aircraft. In the past half month, armed merchant ships have been sailing out of British ports in a steady stream, some under convoy, some departing alone. In a short time, the entire British Empire's shipping industry will be armed. Normally, Britain has 2,000 ships sailing at sea every day, so arming merchant ships is a large-scale undertaking. However, the ports now have gun emplacements and other equipment, as well as trained gunners to manage the gun emplacements and train the crew. Thirdly, British warships are attacking submarines. British warships are now searching for and attacking submarines with great courage and intensity. Compared to 25 years ago, the Central Kingdom today has far more advantages in dealing with submarines. In the past, when searching for and attacking submarines, it often required 15 or 20 destroyers to coordinate actions for a whole day. Now, one or two destroyers are enough to maintain a pursuit for a long time. The intensity of attacks on submarines by warships and aircraft in this war is almost five or six times greater than in any similar period during the last war. In the first half month of the war, Germany has lost six or seven submarines. The Prime Minister has already mentioned this matter before. According to this number, it accounts for ten percent of the total number of submarines that Germany possessed at the start of the war. Counting the submarines that Germany has actively utilized, the number that have been lost is almost one-fourth or one-third. However, Britain's attacks on submarines are only just beginning. The strength of Britain's search and attack on submarines is increasing day by day. Around late October, this strength may be three times greater than at the start of the war, and the opportunities for submarines to attack in the open sea will also be greatly reduced with the implementation of the convoy system. The British Air Force has important work in searching for and attacking submarines in this intense war, supplementing the inadequacy of Britain's strength at the beginning of the war. The Admiralty has decided to make as much use as possible of aircraft carriers in order to protect the many unarmed and unconvooyed merchant ships sailing to the British coast. However, the crisis of naval warfare is always present, and sometimes tragedy cannot be avoided. The Courageous was followed by four destroyers, but two of them happened to be searching for and attacking a certain submarine attacking merchant ships, and were not beside the Courageous. As the Courageous was preparing its aircraft for landing on the deck in the twilight, it was suddenly attacked by an unseen submarine. This is indeed a very rare encounter. However, this blow has not reduced our confidence in the methods currently being adopted. Now, three weeks into naval warfare, I feel that the new methods formulated by the Admiralty before the war do not need to be modified in any way. Britain's world trade is still continuing without interruption and has not been reduced in the slightest. The ships transporting British troops are currently arriving at their destinations under escort, while enemy shipping and commerce have disappeared from the sea. More than two million tons of German ships are now avoiding German and neutral ports. The number of German ships that Britain has already seized and repurposed for its own use is 67,000 tons more than the number that Britain has already lost. (The audience cheered loudly at this.) In terms of oil, Britain has unfortunately lost several oil tankers, but in the first half month, Britain lost 60,000 tons of oil and captured 50,000 tons of enemy oil. In addition, a large number of oil tankers have arrived safely in Britain by normal means. Britain lost 65,000 tons of ships in the first week of the war, 46,000 tons in the second week, and 21,000 tons in the third week. In the last six days, only 9,000 tons have been lost. Britain now has more supplies in storage than it did before the declaration of war. In any case, it is not possible for Germany to starve the British in a short time. German submarine commanders sometimes strive to act humanely. We have seen them give advance warnings and try to help the crew save their lives. One commander even sent a telegram to me personally, telling me the location of the British ship he had sunk, and signed the telegram "German Submarine." When I received the telegram, I did not know where to reply, but that person is now in our hands and is being treated appropriately. (The audience cheered.) However, German submarines are not lacking in cruel acts, as evidenced by the sinking of the Athenia, the Royal Sceptre, and the Haxby. Britain cannot accept that this kind of war does not conflict with the war customs of arbitration and the laws of war that Germany has been willing to accept in recent years. Britain is now trying to make up for the ships it has lost. Therefore, ships that have already been shelved are now being repaired and prepared for sailing, and in addition to implementing shipbuilding procedures, new ships of a simple nature are being rushed to be built. Therefore, Britain will soon have more ships to cope with various new forms of attack. (Reuter, 26th)

(London) After Churchill spoke, Labour Party leader Attlee took the floor and said that the House of Commons welcomes Churchill's powerful remarks and admires the work of the Navy and Air Force in countering the scourge of submarines. The close cooperation between Britain and France in all aspects is also welcomed by the House of Commons. Britain's morale is very good now and should be maintained throughout. Liberal Party leader Sinclair also spoke, slightly criticizing the leaflets that were finally dropped on Germany, saying that he did not believe that these leaflets would have the expected impact on the German people. If British manpower is not utilized properly as soon as possible, extremely bad consequences will occur. Hitler is trying to end the war in six months, so Britain urgently needs active preparation and organization to resist the crisis that Britain will encounter. (Reuter, 27th)

### German Giant Ship Bremen Confirmed to Have Fled to the Soviet Union

(London) First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill stated in the House of Commons this afternoon that the German large passenger ship Bremen has been missing since it left New York. According to British naval sources, this ship has already taken refuge in a certain Soviet port. (Havas, 27th)

### Sweden Protests to Germany Regarding the Sinking of Cargo Ships

(Stockholm, Sweden) Following the sinking of two Swedish ships, the "Gatruert Bratt" and the "Szlezien", which were carrying wood pulp and lumber, respectively, by German submarines, the government has ordered its minister to Germany, Mr. Lisher, to lodge a protest with the German government and reserve the right to demand compensation. (Havas, 26th)

(London) Following the repeated sinking of neutral ships, it was rumored that the Swedish government had ordered a ban on the export of celluloid and wood pulp by Swedish ships. The Swedish legation has issued a public statement denying this, stating that the country's export trade is proceeding as usual and there have been no changes. (Havas, 26th)

(Stockholm, Sweden) Following a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four Nordic countries (Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark) in the middle of this month to discuss neutrality issues, it has been decided to hold another meeting here on the 28th of this month to discuss maritime safety issues. It is generally believed that this is related to the repeated sinking of neutral ships. (Havas, 26th)

(London) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop recently claimed that the British government had sent notes to the three neutral countries of Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands, threatening them not to export certain raw materials to Germany, or allow them to be transshipped to Germany, otherwise they would be considered to have violated neutrality. The Information Department has issued a public statement denying this, stating that the governments of Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands have all stated that this is not the case. Furthermore, it is said that Germany claims that it has not signed the 1936 Submarine Warfare Agreement and is not bound by it. In fact, Germany was one of the original signatories to this agreement and was also the first country to violate it. (Havas, 26th)

### The United States Defends Its Neutral Rights, Negotiating with Britain to Reduce Inspection Difficulties

(Washington) British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in a speech in the House of Commons today that Britain is negotiating with various neutral countries to resolve the issue of their trade with Germany. When Secretary of State Hull was asked about this matter by reporters today, he replied that the US government hopes to reserve all rights and also hopes to find ways to reduce the difficulties faced by neutral ships due to the belligerents' implementation of blockades. At this moment, they are in contact with the British government to simplify the procedures for British warships to inspect American ships. (Havas, 26th)

(Washington) President Roosevelt recently made a statement to reporters, saying that various goods, especially metal products with military value, are necessary for US national defense, and he hopes that the people will not sell them to foreign countries. Also, certain metals such as manganese, tin, and chromium, as well as rubber, the United States has to purchase from foreign countries to supply national defense industries. Although current laws do not prohibit the sale of these items, after I make this request to the press, the people should be able to understand and not export them to foreign countries. (Havas, 26th)

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull reiterated his attitude on neutrality yesterday, stating that the US government is determined to reserve the neutral countries' right to navigate under international law. Therefore, the British and American authorities will hold informal discussions on the scope of naval warfare in order to reduce the difficulties of American shipping. According to British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Britain is discussing the issue of naval blockade with neutral countries, so Hull's remarks have indeed confirmed Chamberlain's words. Isolationist senators in the United States held a meeting yesterday and decided to attack President Roosevelt's neutrality plan and oppose the repeal of the arms embargo. (Associated Press, 27th)

(Washington) After a senior official announced that the Navy Department had decided to send a large number of warships from the Pacific coast to Hawaiian waters for training, it is widely believed that some officers in the US Navy advocate concentrating the Pacific Fleet in San Pedro Harbor and distributing it to various regions. (Reuters, 26th)

(Washington) While the Navy Department is preparing to concentrate the fleet for exercises in Hawaii, President Roosevelt yesterday discussed with Representative Scrugham, chairman of the House Naval Appropriations Committee, a plan to strengthen the US Navy. Scrugham informed the President that the Navy seemed ready and that the country was quite confident in the current situation. After meeting with the President, Scrugham told reporters that the European war would probably not increase the US Navy budget for the next year. He solemnly stated that the size of the naval budget will be based on developments between now and January 1, 1940. (Associated Press, 27th)

### Pan-American Conference Discusses Neutrality Issues, Plans to Divide a Safe Zone on the Western Side of the Americas

(Panama City, Panama) Regarding the issue of maintaining neutrality in the Americas, Mexico, Cuba, Bolivia, Colombia, and the United States have all submitted proposals to the Pan-American Conference. The conference held a closed-door meeting at 10:45 am to discuss the proposals of Cuba and Colombia, but no vote was taken. It continued to meet in the afternoon and decided to form three committees: a Neutrality Committee, a Peacekeeping Committee, and an Economic Cooperation Committee. The Cuban proposal has attracted great attention from all parties, but it involves many issues that need to be studied at length. The main purpose of the proposal is to establish a so-called "continental sea" as a safe zone on both sides of the American continent, that is, in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, so that all wars, in whatever form, will not spread to the coasts of the Americas. The establishment of this zone is based on the preservation of neutrality by the American countries, requiring respect from all belligerents. The key points of this proposal can be divided into three items: (1) Any actions by belligerents that are intended to spread the war to the continental sea shall be regarded as endangering the security of the Americas. (2) Presumed lines will be drawn in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans between the western Americas and Europe and Africa, and between the eastern Americas and Asia. Within these lines is the continental sea, which will be a safe zone in which belligerents may not engage in combat or exercise belligerent rights, interfering with the commerce or mutual relations of the American countries. (3) After the above proposal is passed, it will be published in the form of a declaration, named the "Panama Declaration". (Havas, 26th)

### Ambassador Hu Gives Speech in the US, Saying Countries Will Continue to Aid China

(Washington) Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih recently gave a speech to the American Women's Press Association, stating that although the European war has broken out, all countries will continue to aid China. China has been fighting for all democratic countries for more than two years. Now that countries are fighting for the restoration of Poland, they cannot abandon China. Even the Soviet Union probably has no intention of abandoning aid to China. (Havas, 26th)

(Chongqing) China's army mouthpiece, "Saodang Bao," published an article this morning stating that President Roosevelt's Neutrality Act is beneficial to Britain and France and has no impact on China. Because German merchant ships have disappeared from the sea, the "cash and carry" terms only benefit Britain and France. Since the United States has not recognized the war between China and Japan, the current Neutrality Act will not affect China. The new Neutrality Act is ostensibly aimed at preventing the United States from being drawn into the European war, so President Roosevelt's proposal will likely be passed by Congress. (Reuters, 27th)

### US Revises Neutrality Act, Lindbergh Does Not Oppose Lifting Arms Embargo

(Washington) Colonel Lindbergh, a famous aviator who advocated banning arms exports, held a closed-door meeting yesterday with six senators who advocated repealing the embargo provisions to discuss the revision of the Neutrality Act. It is said that his views on the government authorities show agreement. If so, the isolationist faction has probably lost an important leader. A senator who participated in the meeting said that the rumor that Colonel Lindbergh belongs to the isolationist faction is not accurate, and that the current Neutrality Act really needs to be revised, which Colonel Lindbergh also agrees with. (Havas, 27th)

(Ottawa) Regarding the revision of the US Neutrality Act, the draft proposed by the government occasionally stipulates that the various restrictions of the current Neutrality Act do not apply to military supplies transported abroad via rivers, lakes, and the land border with the United States. Although the term "abroad" does not specify a country, its intention is clearly to give the Canadian Federation a convenience that other belligerents cannot enjoy. Political figures here are very pleased to hear this, believing that after this amendment is established, American military supplies can come continuously, directly improving the Canadian Federation's combat capability, which also indirectly improves the combat capability of Britain and France. Therefore, Canada will occupy a very important central position between Britain and France and the United States. (Havas, 26th)

### US Ambassador to Japan Embarks to Return to Post

(San Francisco) US Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grew, has returned to the country for four months. Yesterday, he boarded a ship here to go to Yokohama. Mr. Grew visited President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull during his return to the United States. Also, US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, is scheduled to sail to Manila on the Cleveland liner today. (Associated Press, 27th)

### British Chancellor of the Exchequer Announces Increased Income Tax

(London) At the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Simon declared, "The current development plans must be based on preparation for a three-year war. Therefore, the people of the whole country must make significant sacrifices and contributions to national taxation. Various direct tax rates must be increased, including income tax, which should be increased to seven shillings from January 1st to March 31st next year. The next fiscal year, that is, from April 1st next year, should be increased to seven and a half shillings. It is estimated that this fiscal year can increase revenue by £70 million, and the next year can increase revenue by £146 million." (Havas, 27th)

### French Government Decides to Dissolve Communist Party, Move Carries Great Significance

(Paris) The Cabinet has decided to dissolve the Communist Party, which split from the Socialist Party in 1920. The leaders of the Communist Party are Garsin, Doray, and Kalamanas. (Reuters, 27th)

(Paris) The Council of State decided today to dissolve the Communist Party and all organizations related to the Party, and to prohibit the publication of all kinds of books and pictures promoting communism. Communist congressmen must accept this decision of the government and stop propagating communism in order to continue to attend the congress. However, the congress may still convene closed meetings when necessary and refuse Communist congressmen to attend. (The French General Confederation of Labor decided yesterday to completely break away from the Communist Party.) In addition, the Council of State also decided that insulting the British Empire will be punished in the same way as insulting France. (Havas, 26th)

(Paris) The Cabinet decided that no action would be taken against the 70 communist members of the House of Representatives and the two communist members of the Senate unless they broke the law. At the cabinet meeting, Premier Daladier reviewed the overall political and military situation. The French Communist Party has 500,000 dues-paying members. In the 1936 election, the Communist Party received 1.25 million votes. The party organization can be described as second to none among French parties. (Associated Press, 27th)

(Paris) After the Council of State decided to dissolve the Communist Party and its affiliated organizations, the police authorities sent personnel to guard the Party headquarters and the offices of various organizations, and prevented Party members from continuing their activities. (Havas, 27th)

(Paris) The dissolution of the French Communist Party has been commented on by political and diplomatic figures, who all say that its significance is extremely great. It is not only related to domestic affairs, but also a clear proof of France's determination to resist internal aggression. In the past, German propaganda often falsely accused France of being the source of the "Red Peril". France's actions this time are a response to this. Since the establishment of the German-Soviet agreement, European countries from Italy to the Balkan Peninsula and Turkey have been uneasy about the threat of Bolshevism. Recently, there have been rumors that the Soviet Union concentrated its troops and threatened the border of Romania, although the Romanian side has firmly denied it. However, the nature of the Soviet Union's influence on Poland has already affected the ideological realm. Given the situation, those Eastern European countries with weaker social structures and Slavic minorities in their countries are right to be afraid. It is reported that the governments of Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria are currently exchanging views and plan to organize a united front to strengthen their solidarity. (Havas, 27th)

### Hungary is Highly Wary of the Soviet Union, Soviet Troops Are Only Sixteen Kilometers from the Hungarian Border

(Budapest) According to news heard here today, the progress of the Soviet Red Army has been halted due to wind and snow in the Carpathian Mountains. The Red Army is still sixteen kilometers away from the Hungarian border. Political circles here were initially alarmed by the fact that they will soon be directly adjacent to the Soviet Union, as this development was completely unexpected by the Hungarians. According to officials here, Hungary's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact is not against the Soviet Union, but only against the Third International. However, people here have always regarded the Third International and the Soviet Union as one and the same, with no difference between them. (Soviet Telegraph, 27th)

### Lithuania Trusts the Soviet Union, Believes the Crisis is Over, Army Begins to Demobilize

(Lithuanian Capital) Since the Lithuanian government obtained the guarantee from Germany and the Soviet Union that they would respect Lithuania's neutrality, it has continued its demobilization efforts today. According to Lithuanian newspapers, Lithuania and the Soviet Union have always been friendly, and now that Soviet troops have arrived on the borders of Lithuania, what worries do we have? (Associated Press, 27th)

### The Czech Nation is Under Violent Rule, Puppet Government Obeys Orders, Revolution Will Surely Erupt One Day

(Paris) After the leader of the Czech Catholic Party, former Czech Prime Minister Šrámek, arrived here, he confirmed the unrest in Bohemia and Moravia. Mr. Šrámek recently secretly left, passing through the Polish border to arrive here, accompanied by Hara, the deputy president of the National Unity Party. According to the Germans, the only party that exists in the two provinces of Bohemia and Moravia is the National Unity Party. Šrámek told reporters that when he left, the Prague government was nothing more than a puppet. The German secret police wield absolute power and implement a reign of terror. Even among moderates, their anger is close to boiling point. He believes that the rebellion that occurred in Bohemia and Moravia a few days ago was inevitable. (Reuters, 27th)

(Berlin) The Slovak Consul in London, Mr. Hammin, who yesterday made the comment that "the voices of the Slovak people have been temporarily silenced due to the blatant abolition of all treaties and agreements," has now been dismissed. Mr. Hammin was summoned to Berlin on September 1, but he refused to comply. (Reuters, 27th)

### Internal Disagreements in Germany, Goebbels Loses Favor with Hitler Due to Anti-War Stance

(Zurich, Switzerland) It has recently been heard that the Swedish Minister of Propaganda, Goebbels, has lost the trust of Führer Hitler due to his opposition to the war and his disagreements with Air Force Minister General Goering and Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder. The fact that he has been silent during this important period proves the truth of this statement. Foreign observers here believe that Goebbels may not be openly condemned, but will gradually withdraw from the political stage, and his vacant position may be taken over by Dr. Weiner, a friend of Air Force Minister Goering. (Havas, 27th)

### Former Leader of the Romanian Iron Guard Executed

(Bucharest) Former Iron Guard leader, lawyer Herziglig, was arrested last night and has been executed. His crime was being the mastermind behind the assassination of Prime Minister Calinescu. The government has officially issued a notice on this matter, which also includes the names of other Iron Guard members who have been executed elsewhere, and states that the situation in all parts of Romania is very calm. (Associated Press, 27th)

### Zeppelin Factory Claims it was Not Bombed, Germany Denies British Rumors

(Berlin) The official here has formally denied foreign press reports that the German Zeppelin Aircraft Factory and the Kiel Canal were bombed by the Anglo-French Air Force, stating that the German authorities will invite neutral foreign reporters to visit the two locations to prove the British side's fabrication of rumors. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)

### Dutch Passenger Plane Attacked by German Air Force, German Officials Explain the Truth

(Stockholm, Sweden) A Dutch civilian aircraft flying between Malmö and Amsterdam was strafed with machine guns by an aircraft of unknown origin at an altitude of 2,400 feet in the sky over the North Sea, 70 miles northwest of Heligoland yesterday. Gustav Rehn, a Swedish civil engineer, was killed. Although the plane was damaged, it still landed in Amsterdam. (Reuters, 27th)

(Berlin) German officials issued an explanation last night regarding the shooting at a Swedish seaplane returning to the Dutch passenger plane, stating that "At 2:30 pm on September 26, 1939, the Dutch passenger plane was attacked by a German seaplane outside Heligoland. This was the result of unfortunate circumstances. First, because the aircraft's design was very similar to that of enemy aircraft; secondly, because the weather was poor, making it difficult to identify; and third, because the aircraft entered the clouds after discovering the German aircraft, leading to this accident. However, when the German Air Force saw that it was a Dutch aircraft, it immediately stopped firing." (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)

### Soviet War Report Continues Advance Towards the Boundary Line

(Moscow) The General Staff of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army issued the following war report on the 23rd:

On September 26, units of the Red Army continued to advance towards the demarcation line, occupying the fortresses of Osowiec and the towns of Holmen, Chamosc, and Rawa Ruska, Sambor, and reaching points before Legolodo, Osowiec, Sukory (35 kilometers southwest of Belostok), Melechimon (25 kilometers southwest of Byersk), Baishra, Holmen, Chamosc, Yavorov, Sambor, and Turka (40 kilometers southwest of Drogobych).

On the same day, the Red Army continued to mop up the remnants of the Polish army in western Belarus and western Ukraine. Between the towns of Brest-Litovsk and Włodawa, 30 trains were intercepted and 25,000 Polish soldiers were captured. 1,000 Polish soldiers were captured south of Kobryn. 8,000 Polish soldiers and 1,000 horses were captured in the Holmen area. 2,500 armed Polish soldiers and a batch of military supplies were captured in the Yavorov area (Yavorov is 20 kilometers southwest of Holmen). (Havas, 27th)

### Polish Gold Transported to Syria

(Rome) According to news received here from Istanbul, a Romanian ship loaded with a large amount of Polish gold arrived at the Turkish ports of Haydarpaşa, escorted by Polish officials. It will soon be transferred to Syria or Lebanon. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)

### Jewish Tycoons Move from England to America

(Prague) According to the "Volgar Zeitung" here, several famous Jewish bankers and wholesalers, who moved from Prague to England before the Czech incident, have now moved from England to America. Among them, Jewish tycoon Peterjek, who once controlled most of Czech industry, has sent eight members of his family from England to America. The merchant's desire for safety can be seen from this. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)

### Japanese Plan to Establish Consulate in Macau

(Hong Kong) Japanese Consul Okazaki in Guangdong will be transferred to Hong Kong and will take office on the 2nd of next month. Tajiri will go to Shanghai on the 5th, and Kita will be transferred to Guangdong. Japan also plans to establish a consulate in Macau. Tajiri said that an Anglo-Japanese understanding may be reversed recently. (Special dispatch, 26th)

### The Chinese Army in Northern Hunan Recaptures Guiyi; Fierce Battles Near Xinshi; Many Japanese Soldiers Drown

Changsha – On the 25th, Japanese troops forcibly crossed the Miluo River in multiple directions. A portion fiercely attacked Guiyi, which was briefly occupied by the Japanese. Another portion harassed Xinshi, resulting in intense fighting. At dawn on the 26th, the Chinese army launched a full-scale counterattack, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. By 8 AM, the Japanese were unable to withstand the assault and collapsed. The Chinese army seized the opportunity to pursue and inflict heavy losses. Countless Japanese soldiers were killed in battle and drowned. Guiyi was immediately declared recaptured. The Japanese forces at Yingtain suffered heavy losses after being severely attacked by the Chinese army. There was no fighting near Changle Street on the 26th. (Dispatch of the 27th)

Hong Kong – A Changsha dispatch reports that the battle for Yingtain continued fiercely on the 25th. From morning to noon on the 25th, the Japanese forces attempted to attack Miluo in three directions. Chinese soldiers fought valiantly, achieving victory on all fronts. The Chinese positions on the south bank of the Miluo River were fortified. On the morning of the 25th, a certain mobile unit launched a fierce attack on the Japanese forces at Nanhu Town on the Xinqiang River, achieving a major victory and capturing over 2,000 enemy soldiers. Currently, all fronts are relatively stable. The Japanese continue to amass troops and plan to launch another offensive. (Special Dispatch of the 27th)

Chongqing – According to news received here, fierce fighting broke out yesterday at a location 100 kilometers north of Changsha along the Yuehan Railway. As a result, the Japanese forces have been repelled. There have been no significant changes on other fronts. Chinese military sources stated that there were no major developments in the Dongting Lake and Gao'an battles yesterday. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch of the 27th)

Chongqing – According to news received here today, the fighting in northern Hunan has now spread to the north bank of the Miluo River, but the city of Miluo is still being firmly defended by the Chinese army. The Japanese landed at Yingtain three days ago. At that time, 1,500 Japanese soldiers who landed were killed by the Chinese army. The Chinese also sacrificed an entire regiment (none survived), highlighting the intensity of the battle. Subsequently, the Japanese army used Dongting Lake as a transportation route to continuously reinforce Yingtain, reaching 10,000 troops, hoping to cut off the railway communication line behind the Chinese army defending the north bank of the Miluo River. Currently, the Japanese are attacking Changsha in three directions, each with a full division, all equipped with mechanized units. One route is advancing towards Changsha from the northeast along the highway, another route is advancing towards Changsha along the railway, and the third route is advancing towards Changsha using Dongting Lake. The Miluo River area is indeed the focus of the battle. (Associated Press Dispatch of the 27th)

Changsha – On the 26th, Japanese troops on the south bank of the Miluo River launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army, assaulting more than ten times in one day and night. The Japanese even used poison gas. The Chinese defenders fought bravely and their morale was extremely high. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese positions remained unmoved. The attacking Japanese forces were repeatedly repelled by the Chinese army. (Dispatch of the 27th)

Chongqing – A Chinese telegram received here today stated that after the Japanese army landed on the east bank of Dongting Lake behind the Chinese army, the Chinese army in northern Hunan has abandoned its positions on the south bank of the Xinqiang River and retreated south. They are now defending the line from Xiangyin East to Baishui Railway Station on the Yuehan Railway. Both armies are currently busy redeploying their forces north of Changsha, preparing to start a new battle. It is believed that the Japanese advance has temporarily slowed down due to the rain yesterday.

Tokyo – According to Japanese military news received here today, two Japanese units continued their southward advance along the Yuehan Railway last night and occupied a key military point on the railway 40 kilometers north of Changsha at midnight. Another military news report stated that two other Japanese units, on the morning of September 26th, broke through the first line of Chinese defenses on the south bank of the Miluo River and then launched a general offensive against the second line of Chinese defenses 2 kilometers south of the Miluo River. It is reported that after two hours of intense fighting, the Japanese army forced the Chinese army to retreat from its strong positions. The Chinese authorities are now making every effort to reinforce the Chinese army in the upper reaches of the Miluo River. It is now believed that the Chinese army is attempting to intercept the Japanese army advancing south from Tongcheng. The Japanese army on that route, after defeating 7,000 troops belonging to the 140th, 134th, and 21st Divisions of the Chinese army in the Huangyang Mountains south of Tongcheng, has surrounded the Chinese army in the upper reaches of the Miluo River. The Japanese army is now pressing the Chinese army in that area, forcing them to retreat. (Reuters Dispatch of the 27th)

### A Comparative View of the Two European Wars (Continued) Chen Chuxiang

England's position has remained largely unchanged, due to its separation from the European continent and its powerful navy. Except for air raids, it is unlikely to suffer other invasions. Therefore, it has sent troops to France to assist in both wars. (In fact, England's intervention in European wars also has its traditional route, which is to rely on its superior terrain and naval power, sufficient to protect the country from enemy invasion, while also being able to transport troops to the European continent to fight. Napoleon's defeat by the Allied forces can be taken as evidence. Although the power of the air force has shortened the distance across the English Channel, the air force cannot occupy land. England has been catching up rapidly in developing its air force and air defense equipment in recent years, so the degree of threat is naturally reduced.)

Now the Polish army has been beaten to pieces, and the fall of Warsaw is probably only a matter of time. (As of this writing, Warsaw is still being defended by Polish forces.) Originally, according to comments from military experts in England, France, and neutral countries, Poland was already considered to be doing its best to resist Germany, given its terrain. Along the 1,900-kilometer border between Germany and Poland, Poland did not have strong defenses like the French-German border. The terrain was mostly open country suitable for the movement of mechanized troops. They believed that Poland should retreat in this situation, shorten its lines, and launch a counter-offensive after the dry weather changed, relying on favorable terrain. They cited the story of Poland's war against Soviet Russia in 1920, when it retreated 600 miles and finally achieved a complete victory in the Battle of Warsaw. They believed that Poland's thousands of tanks could still play a major role in the future. Therefore, their conclusion was that the German army would not easily completely destroy Polish resistance in a short period. Unexpectedly, the Soviet Union would suddenly send troops, and the Polish army was finally defeated.

On the Western Front, Germany completely abandoned the offensive of 1914 and repeatedly declared "If people do not offend me, I will not offend them." As for the French army, which adopted an offensive stance, it only carried out local attacks in the no-man's-land between the French and German lines, with only slight progress. The main purpose of the French army was still to probe the weak points of the Siegfried Line, preparing for a joint British-French offensive in the future. French military experts claimed that the Siegfried Line was hastily built and could not compare with the French Maginot Line, which was painstakingly built at a cost of 14 billion US dollars. However, the Hindenburg Line in the last European war was also built in wartime, and the Allied powers were only able to step in when the German army was exhausted. Although the offensive weapons are more advanced than before, are the defensive tools not also? Two years ago, the Chinese army was able to hold out in Shanghai for three months, which shows this point. Therefore, the French army will not rashly launch a large-scale offensive until it has reliable assurance and waits for the British army to arrive with overwhelming strength. This is no different from Germany's attack on France in the last war. At that time, Germany considered that the border with France already had defenses, making an attack difficult, so it forcibly passed through Belgium. Apart from the German General Staff's mistaken estimate of Belgium's strength, was Germany not also acting prudently? In the last war, Germany failed to fully achieve its intended goals in Belgium, and the Russian army launched a major offensive in East Prussia, forcing it to transfer part of its army back east. The Battle of Tannenberg certainly destroyed the Russian army's offensive power, but the strength of the right wing on the Western Front was greatly weakened and its distribution was too wide. As a result, Joffre was given the opportunity to concentrate a large army to cooperate with the British army. In the Battle of the Marne, Joffre drove the German army back to the Aisne River. The Germans themselves could not deny that it was the turning point of the last war. This time, the German army took advantage of the Soviet Union's pincer attack to calmly resolve the Polish issue first, and then concentrate on dealing with England and France, which is indeed much more convenient. What is worrying is whether the Soviet Union will no longer change its mind.

In the last war, England used blockade tactics against Germany, and this time is no exception. Similarly, in the last war, British merchant ships suffered the most damage from German submarines. In recent days, British merchant ships have again been the sole target of German submarine policy. This is originally due to traditional and topographical factors, and there is nothing surprising about it. The total tonnage of the German navy this time is only a quarter of that of England, and in terms of quantitative proportion, it is half as weak as last time. Its submarines are said to be less than half the number of the last time. Therefore, in terms of naval comparison, England and France believe that they have an absolute advantage. Their current problem is only in stopping German maritime transport, attacking German submarines, while implementing a warship escort merchant ship policy, ensuring the safety of their own maritime traffic, and intensifying the blockade to contain the other side. If we hope that the navies of both sides will have some kind of confrontation, judging from the fact that there was only one major naval battle, the Battle of Jutland, in the four years of the last European war, and its result is still disputed by England and Germany, and the truth is unknown, we will probably be disappointed. On land, in order to achieve the actual actions of participating in the last war, England will naturally have to transport troops and military supplies to France to assist. British aircraft, in terms of offensive, will of course very likely stay in France to some extent due to the limitation of distance. In addition to actions on the battlefield, the British Empire has also cut off all commercial ties with Germany. This economic warfare is the main cause of the blockade policy. This blockade line is not as complete as the last time. Germany feels that it has now joined hands with the Soviet Union in the east, and the small countries in the southeast are all maintaining neutrality, which is completely different from the situation of being blockaded last time, which it finds comforting. What will be the future developments and their advantages and disadvantages? It is impossible to foresee for the time being. According to the saying that "onlookers see most of the game," the Japanese military experts' comment that Hitler is a "land-based figure" who ignores the decisive power of the British and French navies, when viewed in conjunction with the fact that the British Empire's autonomous territories are all participating in this war, may have its value. Incidentally, it can be mentioned here that propaganda warfare progressed very quickly almost until the end of the last war. Before the start of this war, Germany consistently adhered to its style of last year, filling newspapers with news of Polish people abusing Germans. As soon as the war started, British aircraft flew over Germany twice to drop 9 million leaflets. In addition, England announced that it was preparing for a war of more than three years, and Germany declared that it would fight for ten years. Apart from genuine determination, does this not also have the effect of propaganda warfare? As for the rumored four-power alliance between Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan, it is even better material for large-print headlines in newspapers. Tanks were invented and applied in the last war. Now, as soon as the war started, it was reported that 600 French tanks had attacked the Saar region. The progress of the air force, the strong fortresses between France and Germany, the new method claimed by England to defend against submarines, and the application of all other weapons and tactics are even more incomparable to the last war.

It seems that Italy has not yet joined the war. This article has not mentioned it. The axis policy of the past few years and the recently concluded military alliance between the two countries have long led people to have the concept of the division of two major camps: the totalitarian countries and the democratic countries, or the aggressive front and the peaceful front. As soon as the war started, Germany actually notified Italy that it did not need its military assistance. According to Reuters, Mussolini broadcast, clearly pointing out that Germany informed him that it intended to engage in armed force when he was busy seeking a peaceful solution, which led him to conclude that Germany had seriously violated the understanding between Italy and Germany, and therefore the responsibilities he had previously assumed were no longer binding. If the above-mentioned news is indeed true, from the surface of the words, we can compare it with the statement made by the Italian Foreign Minister in 1914: "Austria's operations contain aggressive goals and are inconsistent with the purely defensive nature of the Triple Alliance. In this situation, Italy maintains neutrality." We cannot help but feel that there is a "different tune but the same effect." Now, in terms of facts, Italy has at least temporarily maintained neutrality, and it is said that its border with France has been reopened and its foreign shipping has been restored. What will be its future trend? This is really a question that all European countries value the most. Recently, it has been reported that there are frequent diplomatic contacts between Germany and Italy, and England and France are also showing great courtesy to it. Where will Italy go? Is it also waiting for an opportunity, bargaining, like last time, or is there really a secret agreement with Germany to come out to mediate after Germany has won a complete victory in Poland? In the past two or three years, Italy has been used by its allied brother and has really exerted a lot of effort, but in reality, its own momentum is not as prominent as before. Mussolini is now able to jump out of the whirlpool of war and is praised as the most realistic politician in Europe without illusions. Can he easily let go of this opportunity? The Soviet Union is actually willing to join hands with Germany, which is completely the opposite of the attitude of Tsarist Russia, which resolutely supported Serbia last time. What are the conditions exchanged between the two sides? There is really a question worth asking. If it wants to restore its old territory in Europe, in addition to concluding the so-called secret Soviet-German agreement to divide Poland, it probably will not forget the three Baltic countries and Bessarabia in Romania. Its current territory is enough for its future development, and it is already working on this. In the future, will it focus on domestic development, or will it focus on restoring the European status of the Tsarist era? The news that the four-power alliance between Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan was reported in Nanjing is probably a smoke screen for propaganda. If it removes England and France and replaces them with Germany, Italy, and Japan, is it not "replacing violence with violence"? The key figures in the Kremlin will not have carefully considered the key advantages and disadvantages between temporary co-option and officially going to sea.

The small countries surrounding the German border are now all maintaining neutrality, and it seems somewhat different from the situation twenty-five years ago, when the European war started due to the dispute between Austria and Serbia, Montenegro joined the Allies, and Belgium was forcibly passed through and resisted Germany. However, at the beginning of the war at that time, other small countries also maintained neutrality, which is not much different from the present. What will be the trend of the small countries now? Germany is extremely concerned and has already issued a warning, saying that if they have any unstable tendencies, they will deal with them with swift action. Judging from the current situation, when the small countries do not have the certainty of killing a tiger that has fallen into a well, their strength is indeed too small, and they probably will not subjectively get involved in the vortex of war. Spain is also currently maintaining neutrality. What kind of repayment will this exhausted, wounded, and unrecovered dictatorship country give to its allied brother? Due to its geographical situation, it is extremely worthy of attention. However, the most painful thing for the general small countries with both advantages and disadvantages is their geographical location, which often causes the belligerent countries to destroy their neutrality. For example, a Belgian plane was shot down by the British, and the Netherlands and Greece suffered unexpected disasters. The nature of the seriousness is certainly not as great as the destruction of Belgium's neutrality in 1914, but the bitterness of their situation can be said to be equally comparable.

Going back from the small countries to the main belligerent countries, in the eyes of the Germans, England is the most hated by them, just like they hated France at the beginning of the last war. Now, Germany says that France is controlled by England and blindly follows it. Apart from diplomatic effect, is there any other possible explanation for this argument? England and France have repeatedly declared that they will never conduct peace talks with Germany under the circumstances that Germany has created a fait accompli in Poland. But now that the big brother of the Slavic people (the Soviet Union) has unexpectedly come out to support it, England and France are inevitably a little embarrassed. When the last World War broke out, the division of camps was relatively clear. Now, even if we temporarily define Italy and the United States as still being in a similar position as before, and add the Soviet Union and Japan, the international situation will suddenly become "confused." The relationship between England and France and the Soviet Union in Europe and the Far East, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany, the relationship between Germany and Japan, the relationship between England and Japan and the Soviet Union, the horizontal and vertical openings and closings, and the choices and abandonments in between are really a "dazzling array" of magnificent views. If you want to give a thorough explanation of these relationships and their destination, I am afraid that only "time" can be competent.

### The Ministry of Education Promulgates Resolutions of the National Education Conference Regarding Measures for Educational Supplies, a Total of Three Measures and Regulations

(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The Third National Education Conference this year proposed matters related to educational supplies, which were resolved as follows: (A) Schools and colleges should seek to coordinate the purchase of foreign books and magazines. The reason given is that during the war of resistance, foreign published books and magazines are sufficient for reference, and it is essential to seek the development of learning. However, in the past, schools and colleges did not coordinate, and purchases were often the same. In addition, many original editions of teaching materials were purchased, which also affected foreign exchange during the war of resistance. In order to coordinate and unify the purchase of foreign books, magazines, and instruments by schools and colleges, and to take into account the balance of foreign exchange, the following measures are proposed: (1) Draft provisional measures for the purchase of foreign instruments, books, and educational supplies by national, provincial, and private colleges and universities; (2) Establish a Foreign Instrument and Book Purchase Review Committee; (3) Schools and colleges jointly establish a Foreign Educational Supplies Agency. (B) Factories and shops in the war zone that manufacture, transport, and sell cultural supplies should estimate the general needs of supplies and find ways to manufacture and transport them. (2) In areas where remittances are blocked, if cultural supplies needed by schools at all levels are supplied by factories and shops, the price can be paid by the competent authority from the allocated funds, based on the receipt voucher and the invoice, after the number of items has been checked, inspected, and the payment amount has been determined, and then deducted from the school's funds. (3) Request the Ministry of Communications to formulate convenience and preferential measures for transportation agencies of water, land, and air transportation for the transportation of cultural supplies in the war zone. (4) If spiritual training materials and important books cannot be supplied by various bookstores, they shall be sent by the higher-level competent education authority. The competent education authorities at all levels shall, according to the required quantity, jointly or independently print them in a simple manner. (5) Simple instruments that can be imitated and applied by schools locally shall be made locally or manufactured by craftsmen. The above-mentioned resolutions on educational supplies have now been approved and promulgated by the Ministry of Education.

The "Provisional Measures for the Purchase of Foreign Instruments, Books, and Educational Supplies by National, Provincial, and Private Colleges and Universities," "Regulations of the Foreign Instrument and Book Purchase Review Committee," and "Regulations of the Foreign Educational Supplies Agency" are recorded below:

(1) Provisional Measures for the Purchase of Foreign Instruments, Books, and Educational Supplies by National, Provincial, and Private Colleges and Universities

(Article 1) In order to facilitate and unify the purchase of foreign instruments, books, and educational supplies by national, provincial, and private colleges and universities (hereinafter referred to as "colleges and universities"), and to save foreign exchange, the Ministry of Education hires experts to establish a Foreign Instrument and Book Purchase Review Committee (hereinafter referred to as "Purchase Review Committee") to be responsible for the selection of foreign-made instruments and the review and distribution of books, magazines, and teaching materials, and to promote the establishment of a Foreign Educational Supplies Agency (hereinafter referred to as "Agency") by various colleges and universities to be responsible for the procurement, transportation, and printing of foreign instruments, books, and educational supplies. The organizational regulations shall be formulated separately. (Article 2) The existing instruments and books of each college and university shall be cataloged according to categories and sent to the Purchase Review Committee for reference. (Article 3) The number of each type of book approved for purchase shall be limited to one copy. If a book that is applied for purchase has already been prepared by a certain college or university, it may be borrowed at any time for reprinting if the Purchase Review Committee approves it as necessary. The borrowing procedures shall be formulated separately. (Article 4) When reviewing and ordering books and magazines, the Purchase Review Committee shall pay attention to the appropriate distribution of the four categories: (1) literature, philosophy, and art; (2) natural sciences; (3) social sciences; and (4) applied sciences. (Article 5) The books approved for purchase shall be determined by the Purchase Review Committee as either purchased individually or jointly. Those purchased individually shall be kept by the college or university that applied for the purchase. Those purchased jointly shall be reprinted by the Agency and distributed to various colleges and universities for preservation. The books purchased jointly shall be distributed by the Purchase Review Committee according to the departments of each college and university, not limited to the application. However, the books used as teaching materials may be transferred and distributed separately by the Purchase Review Committee after soliciting the required number of copies from each college and university. (Article 6) Each college and university shall purchase foreign instruments and books in accordance with the instrument and book purchase portion listed in the temporary budget. After the approved foreign exchange limit for purchase, a list of the types, names, prices, original manufacturers, publishers, or original authors, publishing locations, and years of manufacture or publication shall be sent to the Purchase Review Committee for review. (Article 7) After receiving the purchase application from each college and university, the Purchase Review Committee shall review them according to type, or entrust experts outside the committee to review them, check for duplicate catalogs, consider the appropriate distribution of types, and their purchasing power, and sign separately for individual purchases, joint purchases, or adoption as teaching materials, and report them to the Ministry of Education for consultation with the Ministry of Finance to issue a foreign exchange notice, together with the applied funds, and forward them to the Agency for processing. (Article 8) The Agency shall order on behalf of the applicant in a quick manner based on the application that has been signed by the Purchase Review Committee and the foreign exchange notice issued by the Ministry of Education. If there are many merchants acting as agents for a common category of goods, it shall obtain at least three quotations from nearby, and choose the one with superior quality and low value to order. It shall also instruct the seller to prepare the goods completely and issue a receipt according to the annotations on the application and deliver them to the address. If it needs to be transferred by the Agency, it shall be transferred in a quick manner. The remittance slip and transfer fee receipt shall be submitted to the Ministry of Education for verification and deduction from the accounts of each college and university. (Article 9) The Purchase Review Committee shall approve the books to be used as teaching materials, and shall indicate the transportation and the number of copies, as well as the distribution quantity, on the order.

Native factory nails were previously in high demand, and standard prices plummeted, once exceeding the 60 yuan mark.

### Remaining Balance of Loans from Four Banks Still 100 Million Yuan, Remaining Balance in Shanghai Still Over 18 Million Yuan, All Industries Across the Country Revitalized After Receiving Relief

The Four Banks Joint Loan Committee aims to promote the circulation of capital for finance, agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce in the interior.

Thus, all industries have received relief from the four banks, resulting in flexible turnover, increased production, and doubled exports. Since implementation, there have been significant achievements. The cumulative amount of loans issued has reached 300 million yuan in national currency, and the remaining balance of loans is still 100 million yuan.

Prepare for Year-End Settlements After the Mid-Autumn Festival

Settlement and Reorganization of Shops Unrelated to the Overall Market

Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival settlement day, and all banks and money shops were closed. Companies and firms were busy handling settlements, and all outstanding debts were recovered. The Shanghai financial market, after being regulated by the Four Banks Joint Loan Committee and the Banking and Money Industry Preparatory Association, has been extremely stable due to the increase in new remittances and legal tender funds in the market. All industries have safely passed this Mid-Autumn Festival, and no unfortunate incidents have occurred, unlike in previous Mid-Autumn Festivals. From today, all banks, money shops, and informal markets for foreign exchange, foreign currency, gold, securities, yarn, cotton, miscellaneous grains, etc., will open and operate as usual.

### Representative of World Youth Conference Elaborates on Impressions of European Tour, Chinese Representatives Receive Much Attention at the Conference, All Parties Concerned About the Far East War

The Continental Daily News reports that five representatives of the Chinese delegation of twenty-seven, including Liang Xiaochu, who attended the World Christian Education Youth Conference in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, returned to Shanghai yesterday (26th).

Nine Chinese representatives were assigned to various positions. Although Europeans were aware that war was imminent during the conference, representatives expressed deep concern about

The Far East Incident.

The Chinese delegation's independent arrival in The Hague made a strong impression on the representatives of various countries. Many of them thought that China had been completely blockaded, and they were greatly surprised to discover that the Chinese delegation consisted of men and women from all parts of China. During the conference, world Christian leaders such as Dr. Mott and Dr. Koo gave speeches. Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands read

The Queen of the Netherlands'

Special welcome letter to the representatives of various countries. Mr. Liang mentioned the European war, saying that after the conference, he traveled to European capitals. According to his observations, all countries are preparing, waiting for "the time to take action." He and his fellow representatives encountered blackouts in London in preparation for enemy aircraft attacks. The representatives were most excited when they arrived at Seutaz Port on the Athos II on their way home, as the European war was about to break out. At that time, the situation had reached

An extremely tense state.

Passengers were not allowed to disembark. When the ship docked at Suez Port when war broke out, it was held up for four days, during which passengers were not allowed to send letters or telegrams. At the same time, German Jewish refugees on board were detained in the lower-class cabins by the French authorities. French troops boarded the ship at night to defend it. When the ship set sail from Suez to Djibouti on September 4th, the ship notified passengers that no lights were allowed at night, even smoking on deck was prohibited. When they visited Columbus, they saw that the local youth association building had been converted into a concentration camp, and German people were detained there by the British authorities.

Approximately one hundred guests, including leaders from British and American business circles and Chinese education, medical, and business communities, such as Li Denghui, Liu Tingfang, Zhang Jiafu, and Gu Angruo, filled the hall.

The atmosphere of the meeting was exceptionally enthusiastic.

Corbett was elected as chairman, reporting on the significance of Moral Re-Armament and the recent developments in its promotion in various countries. This was followed by a unified singing of the pioneer song, the melody of which was extremely powerful. Afterwards, Du Lihua reported on the telegrams from US President Roosevelt, the British Houses of Parliament, and Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek, all expressing support for the Moral Re-Armament movement. Subsequently, various speakers took the stage, including Mrs. Du Lihua, Miss Green, Mrs. Merritt, farmer Fillon, Dr. and Mrs. Ferguson of Renji Hospital, Mr. and Mrs. Logan (son of the former Bishop Wu of Hankou), and Miss White of the electricity company, representing the Westerners. On the Chinese side, there were four young people who had recently returned from the United States: Zheng Shuyuan, Huang Yanyi, Tang Minghe, and Cai Wenhao. Lastly, Wang, Diao Xin-de, and Tang Ren-xi reported on their recent experiences and future visions and plans. Because there were many Western guests at the meeting, the entire event was conducted in Western languages. Western newspaper reporters covered the news and took many photographs.

Honesty, Purity, Unselfishness, and Love

The North-China Daily News reported that Chinese and foreign individuals supporting the Moral Re-Armament movement gathered at the Metropole Hotel last night (the 26th), creating a lively atmosphere. Colette Beck served as chairman, and numerous attendees were called upon by the chairman to describe the changes that had occurred in their lives after becoming supporters of this movement. It is reported that the Moral Re-Armament movement, under the leadership of its founder Buchman, is becoming increasingly popular in Europe and the United States. Its origins lie in Christianity, and its principles are absolute honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love.

Moral Re-Armament Can Eliminate the Scourge of War

Those who delivered brief speeches at the meeting last night stated that their lives had changed as a result of respecting and striving to implement these principles. The speeches were very interesting. According to the views of the founder Buchman, the chaos in the world is due to a lack of moral re-armament. In order to achieve security, countries must reorganize themselves morally, because the fundamental crisis of the world is a moral crisis. Mr. Buchman once stated in a published announcement: "If a wave of absolute unselfishness sweeps across all countries, then wars can be declared over."

The Source of Contemporary Conflicts

Speakers last night included Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson of Renji Hospital, Dr. and Mrs. Lu Zi, Pastor Tang, and several other Chinese and foreign supporters. Colette Beck himself was also among them. The famous American statistician Marbison, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, strongly emphasized the urgency of Moral Re-Armament. He stated that if moral re-armament does not replace physical re-armament, it must at least be on par with it. I deeply endorse the efforts of Buchman and his group, who bravely declare that only Moral Re-Armament can save the world from destruction. Today's conflicts are a natural consequence of ignoring God's laws. If we continue to ignore them and still seek peace, then churches and religion are unnecessary. Therefore, those of us who believe in God and study history should expect wars to continue unabated until spiritual awakening occurs. In short, the world must be spiritually reorganized before it can achieve continued material progress.

Food for the Refugees is Gradually Becoming Insufficient

A Difficult Situation is Approaching

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held its 19th board meeting the day before yesterday. Those present were Yu Qiaqing, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, Tang Naikai, Xue Kai, Wu Zhai, Mao Lishi, Yuan Lvdeng, Yan Fang, Li Guangcheng, and Wang Ji. Resolutions included: (1) The standard for refugee food distribution for the first half of September was set at 11 yuan, 8 jiao, 2 fen, and 2 li per 100 people per day, and 1 yuan and 9 jiao and 2 fen per refugee per half-month. For the second half of the month, the standard was set at 16 yuan, 7 jiao, 9 fen, and 1 li per 100 people per day, and 1 yuan and 5 jiao per refugee per half-month. (2) The number of refugees receiving food rations will not be restricted for the refugee maternity hospital and the association's first and second shelters. The number of refugee children in middle school should be based on 1708 people from the first half of September. All other numbers should be based on the number of refugees from the first half of September as the maximum and can only decrease, not increase. (3) Mr. Michael stated that the Nanshi refugee area is currently facing a shortage of funds because the July issue of the charity lottery has been suspended. He proposed requesting the association to purchase 300 tons of Saigon rice from the association at the exchange rate of the seven-member delegation. A public decision was requested. It was resolved that the Saigon rice ordered by the association is specifically for the use of the association's refugee food distribution, and the quantity is only 1,000 tons, which is only enough for a few months of food distribution based on the current number of refugees. The request to purchase 300 tons of rice is difficult to approve. However, since both the Nanshi area and the association aim to relieve refugees, the association should do its best to assist. It was decided to lend 500 bags of Saigon rice to the Nanshi refugee area. If the area requests assistance from the association due to financial difficulties in the future, the association will consider it. The rest is omitted.

### The Second Phase of Military Expenditure Public Bonds to be Issued on October 1st: Term of 25 Years, Annual Interest of 6%, Revenue from Consolidated Tax and Other Sources Designated as the Fund

In order to replenish the funds for the second phase of the war of resistance, the National Government is issuing military expenditure public bonds for the 28th year of the Republic of China. The fixed amount is 600 million national currency. The first phase of 300 million yuan was issued on June 1st. The second phase of 300 million yuan will be issued on October 1st. The annual interest rate is 6%. It is stipulated that repayment of principal will begin on March 31, 1942, and the principal and interest will be fully repaid in 25 years. Principal will be repaid by lottery twice a year, on March 31st and September 31st each year, until all debts are cleared by September 31, 1966. The fund is designated to be the revenue from consolidated tax and tobacco and alcohol tax. The Ministry of Finance will allocate the funds to the account of the National Debt Fund Management Committee of the Central Bank on a monthly average basis in accordance with the repayment schedule, and store and pay them separately. If there is a shortfall, the national treasury will allocate the full amount to make up the difference.

Rumor that a Shanghai-Ningbo Ship Was Bombed is Confirmed to be False

Deping Returns to Shanghai Safely, Moufu Arrives in Dinghai on the 29th

Yesterday, it was suddenly rumored in the city that a foreign ship outside Zhenhai was bombed by a Japanese warship. Fellow Ningbo natives in Shanghai were extremely concerned and inquired about the matter. It has been confirmed that the news is purely a rumor and absolutely false. Since the Moufu ship on the Shanghai-Ningbo line shortened its voyage, it has been very convenient for passengers. The various situations are recorded below.

Purely a Rumor

Since the Shanghai-Ningbo line ships changed their berthing location to outside the port and announced the resumption of voyages, foreign ships have been operating frequently, and both passengers and cargo have been extremely crowded. However, yesterday, it was suddenly rumored in the city that a foreign ship outside Zhenhai was bombed by a Japanese warship. For a time, fellow Ningbo natives in Shanghai were extremely concerned and inquired about each other. A reporter from Dagang News Agency inquired with various shipping companies and learned that the news was purely a rumor. Although Japanese warships are sometimes seen outside Zhenhai, there has been no activity, let alone attacks on merchant ships. The situation there is still safe. The rumor is absolutely false.

Deping Arrives in Shanghai

The Deping ship of the Zhongyi Shipping Company sailed from Shanghai to Zhenhai in October and anchored off Qiliyu to wait for unloading and loading. It has been more than a month. The ship was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 24th, but was delayed until yesterday morning due to insufficient loading. It arrived safely in Shanghai last night at around 10 pm and berthed at the Bund Garden Pier. Some said that the foreign ship bombed in yesterday's rumor was the Deping ship, but this proves that it is nonsense.

Voyage Shortened

Because Shanghai-Ningbo ships unload cargo in order outside the port, the voyage is extremely slow, and passengers are delayed, making round trips extremely inconvenient. In order to facilitate travel, the German merchant Lihua Foreign Firm's Moufu ship decided to shorten its voyage. The ship is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 29th and will still sail to Ningbo on the first day of the month. Fellow Ningbo natives in Shanghai were pleased to hear the news. Yesterday, there was a crowd of people asking for insurance policies at the ship's ticket agency on Ningbo Road. It is reported that tickets will be sold starting today, and it is also learned that other ships will also follow suit, which will greatly facilitate travel between Shanghai and Ningbo.

German Consulate Forbids German Nationals from Communicating with Neutral Countries

The German Embassy in China yesterday notified German nationals in Shanghai that if any German national wishes to inquire about the situation of their relatives or businesses within "enemy territory," they may submit a letter to the Consul General for assistance. They should not independently communicate with the authorities of neutral countries, for fear that such letters will leak German information.

### National Grain Harvest, Partial Establishment of Warehouses for Storage: Encouraging the Establishment of Agricultural Warehouses to Regulate Surpluses and Deficits and Balance Needs

In view of the fact that most provinces have had abundant grain harvests this year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, through the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau, has drafted purchase measures to avoid harming farmers due to low grain prices and to accumulate reserves to prevent famine years. These measures have been approved by the Executive Yuan and have been circulated by the Ministry to various provinces and cities for compliance. The measures also encourage the establishment of warehouses to store and pledge grain, crack down on hoarding, and stabilize prices. This approach is beneficial to wartime food supply. The grain needed in Shanghai is mostly transported from nearby occupied areas, which is not affected. Details are as follows:

Handling Transport, Sales, and Regulating Surpluses and Deficits

Grain transport and sales agencies should be established in the provinces and municipalities where the provincial government is located, in larger counties under their jurisdiction, or in important areas for grain distribution. These agencies should handle grain transport and sales matters. They should also determine the quantity of exports and purchases based on the actual surplus or deficit situation within their jurisdiction and be responsible for handling the regulation of grain surpluses and deficits. Areas with insufficient grain should have grain transport and sales agencies or local governments work with grain merchants and financial institutions to purchase, transport, and store reserves. Areas with surplus grain should supply as much of the surplus as possible to areas with insufficient grain, and there should be no obstruction between provinces, cities, and counties.

Cracking Down on Hoarding and Stabilizing Prices

Grain regulation agencies should provide assistance and guidance to merchants and civilians purchasing and transporting grain as much as possible. When transportation is stagnant, they should find ways to facilitate transportation. If abnormal rises and falls in local grain prices occur due to speculation by unscrupulous merchants, the local government or grain regulation agency should take appropriate measures to stop them. They may also carefully set the highest or lowest grain prices in important grain markets based on the actual situation to prevent manipulation. If private individuals hoard large quantities of grain, hindering the supply of grain to the military and civilians, it may be purchased at a fair price.

Establishing Warehouses to Store and Pledge Grain

Agricultural warehouses should be established everywhere to store and pledge grain. Before they are fully established, simple agricultural warehouses may be set up first, using rural public houses, ancestral temples, or farmhouses and merchant warehouses as grain warehouses to conduct warehousing, pledging, loan and other businesses. Provincial governments should build grain storage warehouses, stipulate phased storage methods, purchase and store grain, and raise funds in accordance with the law to store enough grain to meet the set standards. In addition, they should encourage banks to establish agricultural warehouses, operate grain storage, pledging, transport, and sales businesses, and stipulate that warehouses should maintain close contact with each other and regulate each other.

### British Ships' Import and Export Schedules Are Not Allowed to Be Announced: Secret Orders from the Naval Authorities in China: The Situation Becomes Tense Again, Affecting Business Operations

Since the outbreak of the Second European War, the shipping industries of the belligerent countries have suffered greatly, and there has been a crisis of complete suspension of voyages. Afterwards, there was a slight relaxation. Except for ships that must pass through the Mediterranean Sea, which were all suspended, those sailing along the coast of China and to various parts of Southeast Asia gradually resumed voyages with the understanding of the naval authorities. However, the names and flags of all ships have been painted over, and the smokestacks and hulls have also been repainted.

Changxing Company Received Secret Orders Yesterday: Since then, the situation has suddenly become tense again. The voyages and schedules of the Empress passenger ships of the Changxing Company have been kept strictly secret since the day before yesterday. According to yesterday's newspaper, it was also heard yesterday that various British shipping companies, such as the Great Britain Company, Jardine Matheson, and Swire, have received secret orders from the naval authorities in China that the import and export schedules of ships are not allowed to be announced. Therefore, starting yesterday, the various companies have kept the voyages of their ships strictly secret. This measure will inevitably affect business operations.

Irregular Ship Business Suddenly Becomes Busy

Therefore, irregular ships can take the opportunity to make profits. It is reported that the American ship Grampian, managed by the Hua Lun Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai today and is scheduled to continue sailing to Hong Kong on the 30th. The Norwegian ship Dapu, also managed by Hua Lun, is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow and is scheduled to go directly to Hong Kong on the 3rd of next month. The Norwegian ship Sanmin, managed by Lian Shun Company, is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong on the 30th, also going to Haiphong. The Norwegian ship Boweike, managed by the Qiacheng Shipping Company on Avenue Edward VII, was fully loaded with passengers and cargo and went directly to Hong Kong on the evening of the day before yesterday (the 25th), and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow. There are plans to add more ships to operate on the South China line, which are currently being planned. Shao Shijun Reluctant to Leave, Rushing to Complete the Handover

Shao Shijun, with the support of someone, has been acting arbitrarily since he became the head of the "puppet consolidated tax bureau," causing increasing friction with the "Reformed Government." Since he narrowly escaped assassination this spring, he has spent very little time at the bureau, entrusting all affairs to the head of the first section, resulting in the bureau's affairs becoming increasingly corrupt. Now, at a time when the "new regime" is in flux, the position of "puppet consolidated tax bureau chief" is being sought after by all parties. According to reliable news obtained from a certain party, the head of the bureau was notified by Shao a few days ago that he must rush to complete the handover by the end of this month. In the future, the position of "bureau chief" will be filled by someone with connections to the "new regime." Japanese and Puppet Control of Vegetable Business: A Market to be Set Up at the Four Banks Warehouse, Forcing Vegetable Vendors to Register

The Japanese and puppet authorities are intensifying their control over Shanghai's main food supplies. It was learned yesterday that the "Shanghai Vegetable Market" being prepared by the puppet municipal government is ready to open for business. According to a discussion with a certain freight company, vegetables coming to Shanghai from the countryside will have to pay a "registration fee" at the market, which will inevitably lead to higher vegetable prices. The establishment of the "Vegetable Market" is a step by the Japanese side to complete its control of the main food supplies in the two concessions in order to realize its monopoly plan. The "Vegetable Market" has been decided to be located at the old site of the Four Banks Warehouse on North Suzhou Road, and a wharf will be built so that vegetables transported along the Suzhou Creek can be loaded and unloaded there under control. In addition, several branch markets will be established in the suburbs. According to the Japanese side, after the opening of the "Vegetable Market," the total monthly sales of vegetables in Shanghai will be increased from 400,000 to 600,000 Japanese yen to 1 million Japanese yen after the implementation of this control plan.

Changsha Postal Delivery as Usual: Remittance Fees to Kunming, Qingdao, and Other Places Revised

The General Administration of Postal Savings and Remittance Business recently stipulated the following remittance fees and surcharges for remittances from the mainland to Shanghai or from Shanghai to the mainland: (1) The remittance fee from Kunming to Shanghai has been reduced by 23 fen from 40 fen per yuan. (2) The remittance fee from Shanghai to Kunming is 2 jiao per 100 yuan. (3) The remittance fee for remittances to Chengdu, Chongqing, and other places is 1 yuan per 1,000 yuan (0.1%). (4) The surcharge for remittances from Qingdao to Shanghai has been reduced by 5 fen from 10 fen per yuan. According to a report from a reporter from Xinhua News Agency who inquired with the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau yesterday, although Changsha postal remittances are in a state of war, the postal remittance bureau is still issuing remittances as usual. The limit is 3,000 yuan per person per day. The remittance fee is 1 fen per yuan and the surcharge is 1 fen. Regarding parcels from and transiting through Changsha, regardless of merchandise or personal large or small packages, the parcel business section of the Shanghai Postal Administration is still receiving and sending them as usual yesterday. According to senior officials of the bureau, although postal delivery is difficult due to traffic obstructions, the transportation section of the bureau has been in contact with all war zones to dredge postal transportation and find ways to deliver mail. Moreover, the Changsha Post Office has moved to a certain place after the fire, so the postal delivery in Changsha may be as usual if war breaks out there. However, the delivery time will be extended only.

Combustible Materials Found in Classroom

Fortunately, Quickly Extinguished, Averting Disaster: At a certain middle school at 694 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession of this city, black smoke suddenly appeared in a closed and empty classroom at 12:05 am on the 26th. A certain Mr. Jia, who lived behind the school and was not asleep, discovered it, pushed the door open, and saw that the room was burning. He quickly reported to the school authorities, who in turn reported to the police station and fire brigade. They drove to the scene and completely extinguished the fire at 11:20 am. However, it was heard that when the police officers were investigating the cause of the fire, they found some kind of combustible material in the room. In addition to taking it back for research, many believe that the combustible material must have been placed in the room by someone trying to cause a fire at the school.

Woman Asks to Confirm Identity

Zhu Zhengkui (81 years old, local), a real estate merchant residing at No. 4, Yipin Lane, Chengdu Road, Dagu Road, was recently sued in the Civil Division of the First Special Court by Zhu Wang Dabao (38 years old), who hired a lawyer to request confirmation of her identity. The court approved the request. Yesterday, Judge Tao presided over the first hearing. The defendant himself did not attend, but was represented by a lawyer. According to the plaintiff Wang Dabao's statement, she lived with the defendant when she was eighteen years old. Now, she is suddenly abandoned and ignored, so she is asking the court to rule that she is a member of the defendant's family. According to the defendant's lawyer, who has already been registered, Wang Dabao worked as a maid in the defendant's home in 1936 and the employment agency can testify to this. The plaintiff and the defendant have no family relationship and the facts are completely fabricated. The court verified the statements, and the arguments were concluded. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on October 2nd.

### Shanghai's Foreign Firms Amidst the European War: Prices of Foreign Goods are High and Unpopular, Resulting in Sluggish Business and a Sharp Decline 一栗

Since the outbreak of the European War, Shanghai's industry and commerce have first shown signs of unease. Regardless of whether this is an opportunity for the development of domestic industries, those most affected at this time are British, French, and German foreign firms. Foreign firms have always been regarded highly in the minds of the general public because their business is simple: they are just middlemen in buying and selling, and they can always obtain a large surplus every year. Their employees have light duties and rich incomes (compared to the general situation). However, after the Shanghai War, the business of foreign firms seemed to gradually decline. At that time, due to transportation inconveniences, the prices of foreign goods increased. Recently, due to repeated foreign exchange contractions, the prices of foreign goods have risen even higher. On the surface, foreign firms during this period can make a lot of money. In fact, this is not the case, because the prices of foreign goods have risen to such a degree that customers have become wary of buying them, and the business policy of foreign firms is more serious than before the war. In general, a 20% deposit was sufficient for foreign firms to order goods this year, or even less than 20%. Recently, however, this is not the case. For each item ordered, a 60% deposit must be paid first, and the delivery time is long. Under these circumstances, customers use domestic goods if they can be substituted, and use old ones if they can be saved. Currently, with the outbreak of the European War, merchant ships from Britain, France, Germany, and other countries sailing to the Far East have been suspended. The sources of European goods for Shanghai's British, French, and German foreign firms are not smooth, so the business of foreign firms has suffered a great blow. For the orders that customers have already placed, they have announced cancellations. Sales are limited to the existing goods in Shanghai, but most merchants have a mentality of hoarding for profit because they have seen the precedent of the first European War, where many small merchants became nouveau riches. Currently, those with existing goods such as pigments, hardware, wool, industrial raw materials, and machinery parts are unwilling to sell them and are waiting and seeing. As a result, prices are soaring. The more they rise, the more enthusiastic hoarding becomes. However, in fact, only high prices are heard, but no customers buying goods are seen. It should be known that few people have long been asking about foreign goods, and under the current deformed situation, it is of course even more impossible to talk about them. At a banquet last night, I met a Chinese buyer for a German foreign firm. I took the opportunity to ask him about the business of foreign firms. He gave an example of hardware and said, "The price of hardware has risen by one or two times compared to before the war, but business is not booming. Sales in Shanghai are the largest. Therefore, the business situation is far worse than before the war. At present, with the outbreak of the European War, foreign goods are being hoarded for profit, and there are even fewer buyers. The business is inevitably getting worse and worse." He further said, "German foreign firms have been in a state of stagnation and are now trying to cope with the situation. In addition, they have suffered an unexpected blow, which is the problem of German merchants withdrawing deposits. One of our managers and the manager of a certain British bank were close friends for many years. He once went to the bank to withdraw a sum of money, but the bank manager bluntly said: Friendship is friendship. Under today's circumstances, friendship can only be put aside. We'll talk about it after the war is resolved!" The clannishness of Westerners can be seen. Indeed, foreign firms, which have always been regarded highly, have suffered a terrible fate at this time. Currently, the prices of the remaining foreign goods in Shanghai's mines and ditches are indeed shockingly high, but very few customers are willing to use them. They are just tools for speculators! Chinese people can take this opportunity to strive to manufacture domestic products to replace expensive foreign goods and reduce trade deficits, which is of great significance to the country's finances.

### Disputes over Eviction in Qingyuli: High Court Rules for Delay
### Landlord and Tenant Sign New Agreement, Tenants File Counterclaim Requesting Investigation

The Chongqing Road Qingyuli houses leased by the Shanghai Women's Commercial Bank were recently ordered to be vacated due to the bank's need to rebuild. This was met with resistance from the tenants, leading to a lawsuit. After three trials, the tenants lost, and the bank immediately applied to the court for enforcement of the eviction order. However, all 3,000-plus tenants argued that due to the extraordinary times, finding new housing was difficult and they were temporarily

unable to relocate.

This led to multiple conflicts. Last Friday, the Women's Bank surrounded the houses with bamboo fences, intending to forcibly demolish them, which again led to a dispute with the tenants who tore down the fences. As a result, the Women's Bank reported the matter to the police, who arrested three tenants and charged them with destruction of property in the First Special District Court, releasing them on bail of 300 yuan each

pending trial.

The date for enforcement of the eviction arrived again the day before yesterday. The Women's Bank, under police protection, rebuilt the bamboo fences. However, the tenants, unable to find new housing at this time, were forced to have representatives elected by over 3,000 tenants, burn incense, and petition the First Special District Court, requesting a temporary suspension of the eviction. The executive magistrate Peng Shi and chief clerk Cha Liangjian received them and, after the

tenant representatives

explained their difficult circumstances, Magistrate Peng and others agreed to a three-day postponement. The representatives left satisfied. However, for legal recourse, they have filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. It is also reported that the tenants petitioned the court, filing a counterclaim, stating that the Women's Bank and the property owner, the Poor Children's Education Institute, had actually signed a new agreement, extending the demolition period to December 31, 1941. The new agreement also stipulated a 20% rent reduction from January 1, 1939. They requested a thorough investigation. It is now learned that the High Court issued a ruling the day before yesterday (the 26th), ordering the tenants to provide a security deposit of 15,000 yuan, and granting a stay of execution pending the outcome of the retrial. Furthermore, five tenants, including Liu Xiaoda and Huang Yongbin, were summoned by the Chengdu Road Police on the afternoon of the 26th. As there was no criminal suspicion, they were immediately released.

### Shooting of Mother-in-Law Case Postponed for Investigation; Wife's Condition Improves

Li Guangming, a 45-year-old Hebei native residing at 79 Wenlin Road in the French Concession, who was arrested at No. 322 Jingxingli, Lane 116 on the same road, returned home at noon on the 17th of this month and learned that his wife, Li Jiang (34 years old, from Xuzhou), was still having an affair with Yang Haijiang, a carpenter from Haimen at 128 Zha Pu Road,

carrying on secret relations.

They often communicated privately by phone and secretly met in a room when she went to buy vegetables in the morning. He confronted her, but his mother-in-law, Jiang Xue (64 years old), defended her, causing Li to become angry. He took his service pistol and fired six shots at his wife and mother-in-law, each hitting them twice. The mother-in-law died instantly from wounds to vital organs, while his wife was wounded in the breast and waist. After the

incident,

Li tried to shoot himself, but the bullets were used up. When the police arrived, they arrested Li and sent him to the police station. Li Jiang was sent to the hospital for treatment, and Jiang Xue's body was sent to the morgue. The Second Special District Court verified the report. As no family members were present, the Charity Hall prepared the body for burial. The police then escorted Li to the Second Special District Court

pending investigation.

Further action will be taken after the victim recovers. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Magistrate Zhang Minsheng presided over the criminal trial in the First Division. According to the police lawyer, the victim, Li Jiang, has gradually improved since being admitted to the hospital and is now able to speak and is out of danger. He requested a postponement for a detailed investigation after Li Jiang is discharged from the hospital. The court verified the request and granted the

postponement.

The defendant remains in custody. As for the deceased, Jiang Xue, her son is in the countryside and has received news and come to Shanghai to claim the body and file a lawsuit with the court, requesting strict punishment of the defendant and seeking damages.

### Juvenile Convicted of Embezzlement, Given Suspended Sentence

Lu Yaoting, a Cantonese aged ten, was formerly a bill collector for the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road, specializing in collecting bills from Westerners. On March 29th of this year, he suddenly disappeared, but he sent a letter to the company's

manager, stating that he had embezzled and used 845 yuan and 98 cents of the accounts he collected,

and that he was running away because he could not make up the shortfall. He also attached a detailed account. The company reported this to the police and requested the First Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant. The arrest was made the day before yesterday, Lu suddenly went to the Sincere Company to see the manager, and the investigator Chen Guisheng reported this to the Old Gate Police Station. Detective Tao Rubib arrested Lu and sent him to the Special District Court for embezzlement. Lu confessed

without hesitation

that during the New Year, he and his employer and colleagues gambled in a room at the Astor House Hotel, resulting in losses of over 300 yuan. Unable to make up the shortfall, he then embezzled over 400 yuan and went to Fuzhou to set up a shop, hoping to make a small profit to repay the Sincere Company. However, he failed due to the Japanese air raids. Yesterday, Sincere

managed to negotiate

a method of gradual repayment with him, but he was arrested. The police lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, said that the defendant was young, had no prior criminal record, and showed remorse. For the sake of the defendant's rehabilitation, the court should give him a chance to repent and strive to be good. Magistrate Xie Shi-de considered the report and sentenced Lu to six months' imprisonment for embezzlement, suspended for two years.

### Beggar Steals Thousand-Yuan Bills, Arrested and Sentenced to One and a Half Years

The Xie Yuanxiang Kerosene Company at 750 North Suzhou Road ordered the old treasurer, Lu A-zhong, to withdraw 1,000 yuan from the Four Banks Joint Savings Society on Jing'an Temple Road at 11:30 a.m. the day before yesterday. When Lu was carrying the money back to the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Ningbo Road, a beggar, Tan Longzhang from Pudong, suddenly rushed forward and snatched the 1,000 yuan in legal tender from Lu and fled. Lu shouted, and Chinese detective Zhang Bingchun and others arrived and chased Tan to the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Beijing Road, where they apprehended Tan along with the stolen 1,000 yuan. He was taken to the Old Gate Police Station. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division. The police lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, charged him with robbery. When questioned, Tan Longzhang confessed that he was very hungry and saw Lu buying mooncakes, so he thought that what he was holding was mooncakes, so he robbed him to satisfy his hunger and did not know that it was money. He begged for leniency. Magistrate Feng Shide verified the confession and sentenced Tan Longzhang to one year and six months' imprisonment for robbery as a warning. The original stolen goods were returned to the owner.

### Climbing Over Defense, Beaten to Death

Shen Baosheng, a local man residing at 58 South Wuxi Road, owned property on the east side of Shenjiazhai, Tianyaoqiao, Xujiahui. After the occupation, he entrusted Ni Songhua (53 years old this year) from Dachang to act as a caretaker. He usually traveled to the concession and had a pass. At around 7:00 a.m. yesterday, Ni left the concession for business, but he did not take the designated route. He climbed over the barbed wire fence. Those on guard discovered this and beat him for violating the rules, causing injuries to his abdomen. He went to Renji Hospital, but treatment was ineffective and he died at 1:00 p.m. that afternoon. The hospital reported this to the French Police, who sent detectives to investigate and took the body to the morgue to be examined. His family will be notified today to claim the body.

### Enjoying the Mid-Autumn Festival, Drunk and Violent, One Punch Kills

At around 8:00 p.m. last night, many rickshaw pullers gathered in a small restaurant in Gujia Lane on Beijing Road, drinking heavily to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival. Unfortunately, they drank too much and became intoxicated. At that time, a certain person甲 quarreled with Xu Huachang (40 years old, from Jiangbei), leading to a fight. Xu Huachang was punched in the chest by甲and immediately collapsed. At first, they suspected that Xu was very drunk, but then they saw his face turn pale and quickly called the police, who took Xu away. The hospital notified the Old Gate Police Station, who took Xu's body to the morgue for examination. When they went to the suspect's residence, he had already fled upon hearing the news. Only the suspect's mother was detained for investigation.

### Boatman Shot, Japanese Soldiers Mistakenly Open Fire

Shi Yingen, a 36-year-old man from Wusong, made a living by rowing a boat. At around 3:00 p.m. yesterday, he loaded a boat with firewood from Gaoqiao and rowed into the Huangpu River, hoping to sell it at a good price. Unfortunately, he encountered a Japanese patrol boat midway. The Japanese ordered Shi to stop his boat for inspection, but the current was too strong and the waves too high, making it impossible to stop. The Japanese, seeing his haste and confusion, suspected something was amiss, and as they could not communicate, a misunderstanding arose. They opened fire on Shi, hitting Shi Yingen in the abdomen, causing him to bleed profusely and collapse in the cabin. After the Japanese boarded the boat and inspected it, they arranged to send him to the concession at 4:30 p.m. and admitted him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his condition is critical.

### Woman Sues for Legal Separation, Court Orders Out-of-Court Reconciliation

Zhu Hui-shan, the manager of a paint store at 140 Lane 5, Traffic Road, Shandong Road, was recently sued by his wife, Zhu Wang Rong-ti, through lawyer Zheng Lin-tong, in the civil division of the First Special District Court, seeking a two-year legal separation, monthly support of 150 yuan, and payment of gifted money in the amount of 1,200 yuan. The court accepted the suit, and the defendant, Zhu Hui-shan, also hired lawyers Zhang Yi-ping and Du Xi to file a response, requesting dismissal of the plaintiff's suit and counterclaiming for cohabitation. Presiding Judge Tao summoned them for a hearing and ordered them to attempt an out-of-court settlement. The case was reheard yesterday morning. First, the plaintiff's representative stated that there had been a postponement. The plaintiff's mother and relatives had come forward to mediate, but the defendant was only willing to pay 80 yuan per month in living expenses and was unwilling to pay the gifted money. As the conditions could not be reconciled, the mediation failed. Then, the defendant, Zhu Hui-shan, testified, "Our relationship was originally very good. I have always cohabited with the Qian family. Now Wang has listened to slander and left with the children, asking me for a legal separation. I do not agree, because my income is very small. In these extraordinary times, the cost of living is extremely high, and I really cannot afford two households. Although the gifting of money is a fact, it is not a consolation payment. Although the deposit book is in her possession, my chop is still required for withdrawals to take effect. Now I want to revoke the gift of money in accordance with Article 408, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code." The court reviewed the arguments and postponed the case for further out-of-court reconciliation. If reconciliation fails, the hearing will be resumed on October 6.
### Opium Hidden in Shoe Heels, Still Discovered

Shen Xi-lang, a Shanghai native and shoemaker, hid six packages of opium (weighing six ounces) inside specially made black leather shoe heels on the morning of the 25th of this month and put them on his feet. He walked to the Bund near Beijing Road when he was surrounded by the public. The Chinese police officer No. 2981 arrived and arrested him. Four ounces of opium were dug out of the hollow in the shoe heel. He was taken to the police station and charged with drug trafficking. The defendant admitted that his old mother was sick and had ordered him to buy it in West Shanghai for her to smoke. The inspections on the road were very strict, so he designed a hollowed-out shoe heel to hide it, but he was still discovered. He begged the court to commute the sentence. Magistrate Feng verified the statement and sentenced Shen Xi-lang to six months imprisonment for possession of opium, allowing him to commute the sentence at a rate of three yuan per day. The evidence was confiscated.
### Several Cases of Plague Discovered in French Concession Last Week

According to the French Shanghai Daily report of the 27th, the French Concession Health Department reported the following health conditions within the concession for the past week: Among the Chinese population, 19 cases of turbulence were discovered, with one death. In addition to cholera, there were also nine cases of diphtheria and twenty-nine cases of dysentery.

### White·Slaughter·Events

Hui Jianglan, a Cantonese youth society (Hui Jianglan, 20 years old this year), has been an extra in various film companies. On the 25th, he went to the Wu family apartment at No. 1, Lane 244, Baer Road, and borrowed room No. 38 to stay overnight. For some unknown reason, he stabbed himself. Yesterday morning, he hanged himself in the room with a leather belt on the iron bed frame. At noon, the tea room discovered the body, but it was too late to save him. He had already died. The police were notified and the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue for examination. No family members could be found. The court has been notified for inspection.

Xia Yuzhen, a local young woman, Xia Yuzhen, 30 years old, residing at No. 54, Lane 835, Zhimupu Road, suddenly committed suicide by poisoning at her home yesterday around midnight. After she was discovered, she was taken to Hudong Hospital. It is said that the woman committed suicide because she was angry after arguing with her family.

Qian Shen, the wife of the owner of a paper store in Qinglian Street, Jiumudi, Qian Shen (36 years old, from Zhenjiang), due to gambling and extravagant spending, had her clothes and her husband's clothes all taken to the Changsheng Warehouse in the concession. The day before yesterday, her husband, Qian Longsheng, had no robes to wear, so he beat her several times. That night, she secretly swallowed opium paste and committed suicide. Her husband discovered this and took her to Hunan Hospital for treatment yesterday morning. However, it was too late, and she died on the way.

### Weather Forecast

The Xujiahui Observatory reported at 4:30 p.m. yesterday: The weather around Shandong is clear, with easterly winds. The weather here and to the east will change from overcast to clear, with fog or rain, and easterly or northeasterly winds. A low-pressure system in Central China is currently moving east. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 68.5 degrees, and the lowest was 64. The same day last year, the highest was 83.5 and the lowest was 64.3.

### Luggage Entrusted Two Years Ago Still Missing; Zhang Da-zheng Sues Customs Brokerage

Zhang Da-wei, a 57-year-old Wujin native who now practices law in this city, was ordered by the Ministry of Justice to serve as a prosecutor at the Yichang District Court in Hubei Province in the autumn of 1937. He was then transferred to serve as a judge at the Hankou District Court. He traveled from Shanghai to take up his new post. Due to the suddenness of the journey, he had twelve pieces of luggage worth over 20,000 yuan. As it was inconvenient to carry them with him, he

divided them into sixteen pieces

and entrusted them to the Zhen Da-wei Customs Brokerage at 18 New Yong'an Street in the French Concession to clear customs and load onto a ship for transport. At that time, the August 13th Shanghai Incident had already occurred, but the Nationalist army had not yet withdrawn from the suburbs, and transportation to various places was still convenient. Zhang, fearing that the luggage would encounter accidents or delays en route, specifically requested Yang Hu, commander of the Shanghai Songhu Garrison,

to issue a passport

and handed it over to the customs brokerage to transport the luggage together. Unexpectedly, Zhang did not receive the entrusted luggage from the time he arrived in Hubei until last year, when the Nationalist army withdrew from Hankou. Zhang returned to Shanghai after many twists and turns. To this day, he has not received the entrusted luggage and has no news of it. After inquiring with the Zhen Da-wei Customs Brokerage, they remained vague. He also hired a lawyer to send a letter urging them to investigate the whereabouts of the luggage, but the brokerage refused to receive the letter. At this point, Zhang believed that the Zhen Da-wei Customs Brokerage had committed a breach of trust

and embezzlement.

He hired lawyer Wang Xin-tang to file a self-prosecution lawsuit against Zhu Qi-rong (a.k.a. Zhu A-mao), the representative of the Zhen Da-wei Customs Brokerage, in the criminal division of the Second Special District Court, seeking legal punishment for breach of trust and embezzlement, and attaching a civil suit to recover the original items or 20,000 yuan in national currency, the value of the luggage. The case will be

scheduled for trial soon.

### Different Paths  Jin Ye

"Magicians can all perform tricks, but each has their own unique skills." This principle, when applied to walking, is equally true.

The path of a fool often leads to a dead end. There are several reasons for this: perhaps their eyesight is poor, or they are still asleep, not opening their eyes. They fumble blindly throughout their lives, getting deeper and deeper into a narrow space. If they realize they are hitting a wall and rein in their horse at the edge of the cliff, there is still hope. But if they keep rushing forward, the future is unimaginable. In the end, they will inevitably collide with the point and perish. To encourage such a person, the common saying is: "Died unjustly, self-inflicted disaster; your eyes were not properly opened."

Secondly, a slightly more intelligent person knows (but does not recognize) that there are roads in the world (not dead ends). They do open their eyes and follow existing roads. However, they are quite lazy and only know how to use what is readily available. So, when they encounter high mountains, wide rivers, or the end of the road (not the true end, just the end of a stage), they become hesitant. There is no ready-made road anymore. If they could act like the primitive people described in Zhuangzi, who, when "there were no paths on the mountains and no boats on the rivers," could immediately turn back (ancient people had simple thoughts and there were few humans), but that won't work now. Later arrivals have blocked the way back, so you can't turn around. The only result is being pushed off the road to end in ruin. Of course! Such a person is also not worth emulating.

So, what about those who can stand straight and steady?

If a person is not blind and knows that there are existing roads in the world, that is not enough. They must recognize (not simply know) the history of the road, the reasons for its creation; and they must be able to understand the road they are currently on; and understand the road they need to create and walk. That way, they won't be blind and they won't be pushed off. Unfortunately, even if they don't reach the end, their spirit will endure, and they will still achieve something, allowing later generations to follow in their footsteps. Such people can be called "early pioneers."

Because pioneers need to open up and create new roads, the roads in the world never cease. They can meander left or right, high or low, moving forward.

### A Tour of the Maginot Line  Translated by Yi Yuanjie

In 1914, the French army was obsessed with offensive strategy and despised the method of defending with deep trenches and high walls. Later, when the war broke out, the heavy casualties suffered by the French army were a tragic consequence of the erroneous concepts above.

Since learning this lesson, the French army no longer relies on the flesh and blood of soldiers for border defense, but only on superior firepower and reinforced concrete. Based on the experience of the Great War, they have seen that only by properly coordinating and protecting manpower can they exert maximum defensive value. The Maginot Line is the ultimate expression of this theory.

A Vast Project

The Maginot Line can truly be called one of the great achievements of this century. Just a few simple numbers are enough to show the magnitude of the project. According to an officer who once worked as a supervisor, between 1929 and 1936, about 12 million cubic meters of soil were excavated from underground; about 1.5 million cubic meters of artificial stone were made with reinforced concrete; about 50,000 tons of steel plates were used; about 15,000 workers were hired; the tunnels dug, if made into a straight line, would reach the distance from Paris to the sun; the entire project cost a total of 7 billion gold francs. However, this construction work never ends, and its fortifications are constantly being strengthened.

Impenetrable Walls

During the last war, although the Verdun fortress was bombarded with thousands of artillery shells, thirteen of the eighteen reinforced concrete fortresses remained intact. Therefore, before building the Maginot Line, engineers conducted precise research on the materials used to build the Verdun fortress. They believed that only reinforced concrete structures like Verdun were suitable for the construction of the Line.

But they were not satisfied, and they conducted further experiments to determine how thick the reinforced concrete layer, the steel plate layer, and the soil should be. They used 500mm. Large-caliber short-range howitzers bombard specially built fortresses to test whether they could withstand three shells hitting the same spot. And in actual construction, the outer layer was tripled in thickness. Each of these deeply buried giant towers, weighing 120 tons, was built as a whole. No matter how large the shell, it could not penetrate its solid walls.

Internal Equipment

Inside the Maginot Line, electric motors were installed to keep the internal air pressure slightly higher than the outside, so as to prevent the infiltration of poisonous gas. The cannons in the turrets were mounted on spherical bases, allowing them to rotate freely. The muzzles were embedded in steel plates to prevent the flow of toxic air from the outside. When artillerymen manned their guns, they were just like sailors on warships, unable to see the outside world at all, relying only on officers to direct their movements with a compass. Using reflecting telescopes mounted in steel plates, the officers could see the outside world clearly. They determined their shooting targets based on a gridded map.

### Rainy Days by Jin Mang

The streets wear mourning garb,

The sky flickers with threads of tears;

Threads of tears sting the burning faces of people,

Eyelashes sparkle with crystal light.

What kind of day is this?

The rain will tell you;

The streets, as silent as a "funeral hall," will tell you.

The rain drapes the streets in mourning cloth,

Somber "funeral attire" covers the passersby;

Silent mouths are made even more silent by the rain,

But the beating heart is still a beating heart!

Let the light rain be even more dismal,

Let the city streets be shrouded in darkness—

Dark clouds will thunder with mighty booms,

Then comes a heavy downpour,

Causing the streets to be flooded,

The flood will wash away all decay;

And the mourning garb,

Will be removed from the sky after the storm,

Removed from the city streets,

Removed from the beating hearts of people!

The telephone protection is very dense, all buried under the five layers of dense stone slabs, and each line has at least two backups. The endpoint of these underground networks is the telephone exchange located 150 feet deep. The equipment inside the exchange is sufficient to provide service for 25,000 telephone sets.

If the enemy invades, the Maginot Line area will be immediately covered by a barrage of fire. Each hidden cannon is like a volcano, ready to spew its flames forward, backward, left, and right. This is not enough; the upper structure of each hidden gun emplacement is also covered by a network of light machine gun fire. If enemy soldiers try to approach the top of the fortress, bullets and shells will suddenly fly in from all directions, making it impossible to advance a step.

Strict Vigilance

In the "Maginot" Line area, sentry posts, alarm points, reflecting telescopes, listening devices, infrared-covered artillery fire, and other defense equipment can truly be described as being as numerous as stars in the sky. Whether it is day or night, there are always the ears and eyes of scouts watching everywhere, and defensive weapons are prepared everywhere. Even though we had announced our visit in advance, we were still constantly followed by mobile sentries on motorcycles, monitoring us for a distance. If we strayed slightly from the predetermined route, soldiers would immediately appear and return us to the original path.

The defense works built in the Alps are truly breathtaking. Caves have been carved into the towering rocks, resembling the nests of terrifying demons. The soldiers guarding the Alps River are stationed there. During the harsh winter, the accumulated snow on their tents can be ten feet thick.

Land Fleet

To use an analogy, the Maginot Line is

like a fleet moored on the border in continuous mountains. Each fleet has scouts responsible for reconnaissance; the front of the line is also densely filled with guardhouses, each guarded by twelve soldiers. Their sole purpose is to resist enemy attacks for three days, allowing the high command to identify the main point of attack. Just like naval warfare, after the scout ships complete their mission, they retreat towards the main fleet. The main battleships of the Maginot Line are the underground fortresses. When the scout soldiers in the guardhouses have completed their mission, they retreat to the fortress via winding mountain tunnels. The area of the line is thirty miles wide. Looking around, one sees only hills and mounds, with tunnels crisscrossing underneath, resembling rat holes.

The diversity of architectural engineering is an advantage of the Maginot Line. The size of the buildings varies, and the methods of camouflage also differ, making it impossible for observers to distinguish the true from the false. From the Jura Mountains to the foothills of the Alps, I inspected thirty hidden gun emplacements and could not find two that looked the same.

Underground Castles

Now it's time to talk about the main battleships of the Maginot Line. It is simply a huge underground barracks. There are several miles of passageways, lit by bright electric lights. There are railway tracks for trains to run on, as well as electrical ventilation, hot and cold water facilities, kitchens, dormitories, warehouses, and so on. The warehouses are stocked with enough food for several months.

The警戒綫 (Jǐngjiè xiàn, "Warning Line") protrudes from the ground, like a periscope rising out of the water. Soldiers are on guard in the watch stations day and night in shifts. If an enemy is discovered, an alarm is immediately raised, and then the light machine guns start firing, preventing the enemy from approaching the hidden gun emplacement. At the same time, the top of the hidden gun emplacement is fully prepared, and soldiers approach the turret and immediately unleash machine gun fire.

Apart from guarding duty, the soldiers' only task is to endlessly dig in the soil with iron shovels. They must constantly build protective works, reinforce barbed wire, and tend to the "bamboo shoot field." The so-called "bamboo shoots" are actually large steel bridges driven into the soil with their tips exposed above the ground. These steel bridges are driven into a slope, uneven in height, to prevent tank attacks. When a tank is stranded on the steel bridges, flat trajectory guns unleash their power, destroying the crawling monster from its belly. If the tank escapes this line of defense, it encounters a second steel thorn line, with mines that can be detonated by a mechanism on the tip of the shoot. The tank cannot escape this difficult obstacle under any circumstances.

The soldiers' resting place "must have the greatest comfort and the least danger." This is a famous saying by General Baudoin, and the Maginot Line has reached this standard. The resting places for the soldiers throughout the line are as far away from the gun emplacements as possible. For example, one fortress is located at the foot of a mountain; while the soldiers' resting place is located on the other side of the mountain, connected by a 600-foot-long tunnel. In such an environment, the soldiers are naturally full of energy and vitality, unafraid of the enemy's attacks. Furthermore, in a fierce battle, if a gun emplacement is invaded by the enemy, there are movable steel doors in the passageways that can be tightly closed, so that the invading enemy is confined to a part of the fortress and does not endanger the entire fortress.

(The above is just a sketch of the outline of the Maginot Line. The entire article is based on the inspection notes of Belgian military expert Robert Leurquin. Many places are not described in enough detail and clarity, which may be because it concerns military secrets, and he deliberately wrote vaguely.)

### Deep Breath by Stevie

—Random Notes from Hometown—

Take a deep breath! Fresh and clear air.

It's ridiculous. From childhood to the last few years before leaving home, I lived in this hometown every day. However, I have only now realized the loveliness of the countryside air.

It has the ethereal fragrance of orchids in an empty valley, and the cool freshness of spring water gushing from mountain streams. Why not? All day and all night, it dances in the shimmering ripples, swirling in the wheat waves of the fields, and sucking on the crystal dew drops on the tips of leaves... All day and all night, it is filled with the blue and colorful vitality of life; even more filled with the magnificent, passionate, and vibrant life of the countryside!

I curse the city, the smoke, soot, dust, sand, carbon dioxide, and pigeon coops in the city... Everywhere is a pungent stench and a heavy atmosphere. But I also praise it, for making me now feel the threat to my life.

From the two glasses of the doctor's myopic eyes, a pair of stern eyes, and under a twitching mustache, in a slow and heavy tone, I chose a path, returning to the homeland I had left for many years!

So, every day, I walk around in a few vegetable plots, along a row of low trees, extending to the boundless wilderness and distant paths, even facing a clear autumn pool.

At leisure, I count the morning stars in the sky, laughing at them for trembling in the face of the morning breeze; I peek at a crescent moon, moving from the chimney to the treetop over there, waiting for the sky to turn from blue-gray to light purple, and the rosy clouds to faintly appear under the smoky willow trees; I also quietly watch the blue sky reflected in the water, and fish nibbling at the edges of the clouds...

Boundless blue waves in the fields, thatched huts dotted in the green sea, the loneliness of small birds, the mist of dawn, and a few sparse shadows scattered here and there. I do this every day; I see these floating points every time (perhaps they also see this little point of me). Is this my post? And is that their sentry line?

I seem to have glimpsed the secrets of nature; I want to throw myself into the embrace of the earth, the hometown is too beautiful!

Sometimes, a few gunshots cut through the sky, and I smell the odor of millet, which is more stimulating than the gasoline in the city.

I seem to have glimpsed the true meaning of life. I breathe deeply, like the greed of old people, unwilling to let go of even the smallest bit, not afraid of bursting my lungs because the hometown air is so lovely.

Every day, I patrol in a few vegetable plots...

I breathe deeply...

### Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Love Domestic Films

— Xiong Jian

Recently, Mr. Hu Qiufu, a representative of the Singapore Film Company, came to Shanghai to negotiate the purchase of film prints. I happened to meet him at an occasion the other day and talked to him about the recent situation of domestic films in Southeast Asia.

Mr. Hu said that in Southeast Asia, the world used to be dominated by martial arts films and supernatural films, and only these types of films could make money. However, since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the overseas Chinese have been extremely enthusiastic about their motherland, and their attention has also shifted. They hope to learn about the recent situation of the motherland and the war of resistance on the screen. Their film company has contracts with the Tongqing and Central China film studios. All "Central" productions, whether newsreels or feature films, are first shown in the cinemas belonging to their company in Southeast Asia. In the past, every film was very popular among the overseas Chinese.

As for entertainment films, the most popular in Southeast Asia are historical costume dramas. The subjects of historical costume dramas are mostly popular historical stories, characters, and events that have long been known to every household, young and old. In the past, films such as "Meng Jiangnv", "King of Chu", and "Mulan Joins the Army" were extremely attractive to audiences. Moreover, historical costume dramas all belong to historical events and rarely involve modern politics and society. When the local inspection foundation examines them, things like deletion and editing will not occur.

After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Hu visited various film companies and took the opportunity to negotiate the purchase of prints. He is in contact with acquiring several costume dramas that are currently being made by various companies. Regarding the future, if there are any good films in Shanghai, Mr. Hu has entrusted director Wu Cun to notify him after watching them at any time. He also told me that he is preparing to contact several Soviet films to be shown in Southeast Asia.

### Ms. Lan Lan Talks About: The History of Drama and "Sai Jinhua" (Part 2)

— Leng Fang's Notes, Random Notes by Performing Artists. Work in the Last Two Years

After coming to Shanghai, I began performing on stage when the 40s Drama Society performed "Sai Jinhua". I reluctantly took on the role of Mrs. Klingde. Although I felt that I did not perform very well at the time, my interest in performing was greatly increased. Next, "Love and Death" and "Marriage" were staged one after another, and I played a more important role in each. After the "August 13th" incident, until the national army on the Songhu Line withdrew westward, many colleagues in the art world left Shanghai. I wanted to do as much work as possible in the silent isolated island of the theater world. Up to now, in addition to performing in various drama societies, I have acted in "Women's Apartment", "Sunrise", "Mei Luo Xiang", "Love and Death Struggle", and "Tears of Flowers". I have also directed the two dramas "Demon of Desire" and "Tears of Flowers". This is also my first attempt. Of course, I cannot expect to have any good results.

The first taste of the silver screen I love movies, just like I love drama. I have never had the idea of making movies. Not long ago, Yihua Company invited me to perform in "Women's Apartment." After this attempt, it has aroused a great interest in me. I believe that movies and dramas are sister arts that have a connection. In acting in movies, I can see myself on the screen, and then correct my performance. It is indeed more interesting than acting in dramas. However, when I first stepped onto the photography scene, I felt very scared. The scene was so empty and hollow, which was different from the situation where there were many audiences in front of me when performing a drama. Moreover, the filming work only makes fragment performances for each shot, and emotions are difficult to express consistently, which is not as pleasant as performing on stage.

Feelings about acting in Sai Jinhua These days, I am starring in "Sai Jinhua" at the Xuan Palace Theater. This play uses Mr. Xiong Fosi's script and has been heavily adapted by Mr. Wei Ruhui. In order to make the era of the original work different from the current situation and to adapt to the objective environment at this time and place, the entire play has been cut into four acts while maintaining its brilliance. The content performed is only limited to the life deeds of "a famous courtesan." All costumes, props, and scenery have been borrowed from Xinhua Company this time, which is really a great help that adds a lot of color. However, limited by time - the obsolete Mid-Autumn Festival will be staged at the Xuan Palace Theater. I am afraid that I will not be able to perform my play well. I will sincerely accept criticisms and advice from all parties. In addition, my feelings about Sai Jinhua are that she is very forthright by nature, and because of her rich life experience, her observation of things is very clear. Furthermore, in the chaotic situation under the Allied Forces' entry into Beijing at that time, a prostitute could only do so. From her personal standpoint, it was indeed correct; but when considering the entire matter, I still hope that the audience can take a broad view and should not give this character in the play any sympathy.

### From Zhao Junyu's Inability to Return to Shanghai, to the Reason for Naming Him Little Ox

— Liu Zheng Hu

Zhao Ruquan is on stage, but Zhao Junyu, who shared hardships with Zhao and was inseparable from him, has not been seen. The general fans are suspicious. Now I will write down the reasons why Junyu could not return to Shanghai and the reason for naming him Little Ox in his childhood.

According to Junyu, he is one of the four famous Dan in the south, and his fame is well-known in the pear garden. He first learned the art of the big face, and his stage name was Da Da Shi Kuiguan. Then he changed to martial arts student, then sang Xiaosheng, and in recent years he has been known as Qingyi Huashan. In short, his life's art is vast and profound, which is convincing. Ruquan relies on him as his right-hand man, which is well-founded. I love listening to him perform the Xiaosheng play "White Gate Tower" the most. His appearance is handsome and refreshing, like a jade tree facing the wind. The singing is also very charming (Ziyun); Junyu was originally a martial arts student with deep attainments. Unfortunately, in recent years, he has indulged in black books and especially likes women. Twenty years ago, he was contended by promiscuous prostitutes. Now his color and art are much inferior to what he was back then, and he is hardly mentioned. Junyu has native products to smoke in Yunnan, and the price is quite low, so he can live in peace. Therefore, although he wants to come to Shanghai, he has not been able to do so.

Junyu's grandfather, Gao Shou, in Jian'ou, was known for his kindness in his hometown; his father, Xiaolian, was a famous martial arts student. When I was a child, I watched him perform "Iron Rooster", and I still have a deep impression of it. Junyu is also from a family of actors. His nickname, Little Ox, is said to be because his grandfather Gao Shou once strolled outside and suddenly saw a farmer leading an ox past. When he reached the front, the ox suddenly stopped moving, lay on the ground and cried mournfully, with tears like a tide. Gao Shou felt pity and was surprised by it. He asked the farmer the reason, and the farmer said that he was going to lead him to the slaughterhouse to be sold. When asked about the price, he said that 30 taels of gold would be enough. Gao Shou then used 32 taels to pardon the ox's death and release it to the animal park. At that time, his daughter-in-law was already pregnant and about to give birth. One day, Gao Shou was taking a nap at home, and in a daze, he saw an old ox rushing into the inner chamber. He was shocked and woke up. Suddenly, his family reported that he had a grandson. Gao Shou recalled the dream and named him Little Ox. Although the matter involved superstition, it was quite interesting. Junyu received the family's remaining celebration and was full of talent. It was not difficult for him to show off in the theater world. Unfortunately, he was misled and could not compete with Ruquan at the same time in Shanghai, but was frustrated in southern Yunnan. No wonder Xiaolian often wanted to burst into tears when he heard that he was not coming.

Overview of "One Night Empress" "One Night Empress" tells a lingering and deeply moving story. Under the director's careful handling, the story is quite brilliant. Mr. Zhang Shankun's first direction is such an amazing work!

The story is based on the famous Peking opera "Mei Long Town", but "Mei Long Town" only tells a fragment of Qi Xie's story, while "The Night Empress" goes even further. Not only does the film reverse the self of the Peking opera "Mei Long Town", it also permeates the consciousness of the times. For example, when Li Fengjie was robbed by the evil tyrant Li Jingwu, Xiao Xi called on the masses to work together to rescue her; when Li Fengjie was separated from Emperor Zhengde, she advised Emperor Zhengde to focus on national affairs and not be attached to personal love, etc. It can be seen that the film is indeed outstanding and worthy of repeated aftertastes!

Chen Yunshang's "Mulan Joins the Army" and "Fairy Yunshang" have given us very good impressions one after another. In this drama, thanks to the director's giving her more opportunities for close-up shots, her performance is further improved. Mei Xi's Emperor Zhengde is also not an ordinary actor who can handle the role. The suitability of the other actors also shows that the film did go through careful consideration and coordination before production.

### The New Atmosphere of the Storytelling Arena After Autumn Cool

— Yu Xiu

Hot weather is originally the "confinement period" for storytelling arenas. You think, who would be happy to sit bored in a small room in the scorching heat? Therefore, the storytellers always have a "summer break" to avoid "playing the top millstone," which is laborious and not rewarding. The storytelling arenas are left to second- and third-rate actors to play the role. Now that the golden wind sends coolness and the early autumn weather is here again, the storytelling arenas naturally cannot let it go easily. They have all readjusted their personnel and invigorated their spirits, so there is a new atmosphere worth reporting.

The first good news is that Li Bokang, who has been in retirement for a long time, has now made a comeback and is broadcasting for a certain company. His voice is round and jade-like, and he is becoming more and more brilliant. The second is that Huang Yian, who was once rumored to have disappeared, has reappeared in Huyuan. Li and Huang are both the backbone of the Runyu Society, and the two books "West Chamber" and "Yang Naiwu" have become "unique copies in the country" that cannot be separated. Therefore, whether it is broadcast on the radio or sung in the storytelling arena, they are welcomed everywhere, needless to say.

Yalu has recruited "Shen Xue", "Jiang Zhu", "Tang Feng" and the veteran Sui and Tang Wu Junan, who has just come out of Suzhou. The lineup is new and can be called second to none; only the four storytellers of Nanyuan, Ye Shengxiang, Xu Jixiang, Yan Xueting, and Zhou Yuquan, can contend with them. Huiquan Dazhong, because Yalu and Nanyuan are in front, Mr. Pan has to be extra careful. The big Mid-Autumn Festival will be clear.

The famous storytelling artists of Guangyu Society are now almost all concentrated in Shanghai: like Ye Shengxiang's Jintai, Xu Jixiang's Heroes, Wu Junan's Sui and Tang, and Li Hanchen's Yue Zhuan, each has its own strengths and is enough to call on customers. Now, old listeners are making the most of their resources, which can be said to be "lucky to listen."

Cheyu Society concentrated its elite in a venue in Nanjing, possessing the strong power of "Mei Lan," "Qin Yun," and "Three Heavens." It is enough to compete with any venue of Guangyu Society and Runyu Society. Moreover, each time, new opening chapters are released, and a large amount of "filial piety" is offered every day. Therefore, listeners who like to listen to "singing" all flock to it. Recently, the threshold is like a market, and each performance is crowded. The business is really not bad.
