Editorial

### Lessons from the Soviet-Japanese Fishery Negotiations

The fishery negotiations between the Soviet Union and Japan have been dragging on for nearly half a year since they were initiated by Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo and Litvinov in October last year. Dozens of meetings have been held without any result. The area of fishery dispute between the Soviet Union and Japan is the fishery area in the Soviet territorial waters of the Sea of Japan, the Bering Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk. According to the Treaty of Portsmouth after the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Imperial Russia allowed Japan to fish in the aforementioned locations along the coast. This is the source of Japan's so-called "treaty-based" rights, and the only basis for Japan's so-called willingness to gamble its national fortune on fishing rights. For thirty years, Japan has taken the opportunity to develop its ambitions under the pretext of treaty provisions. During the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, Japan once occupied the northern sea fishing area by force. Although the occupied fishing area was later taken back by the Soviet Union, Japan's fishing encroachment has occurred almost every year.

The initial establishment of the Soviet-Japanese fishery agreement was in 1905, and it was supplemented in 1928. It expired in 1936. Before the expiration, Japan requested a renewal and revision. As a result, the Soviet Union allowed a one-year extension, temporarily allowing Japan to fish in the specified three hundred and several fishing grounds and to be exempt from the Soviet bidding methods. By the end of last year, the date of the expiration of the extension had arrived again, and Japan of course still hoped that the Soviet Union would continue to grant it. However, the Soviet Union recently not only saw through Japan's insatiable ambitions, but also discovered that Japan had taken advantage of the convenience of the aforementioned fishing grounds to engage in activities within Soviet territorial waters that were detrimental to Soviet national defense. Therefore, the Soviet Union resolutely advocated the recovery of more than 40 fishing grounds related to national defense. At the same time, in view of Japan's overdue payment of the Chinese Eastern Railway debt, the Soviet Union made Japan's repayment of the 6 million yuan Chinese Eastern Railway debt a prerequisite.

Since the start of negotiations last year, the Japanese authorities have repeatedly issued threatening remarks, but the Soviet Union has insisted on its original position and has not been shaken. On the 15th of this month, during the suspension of negotiations between the two sides, the Soviet Union resolutely auctioned off 300 and several fishing grounds. Four of them have already been auctioned, all of which were obtained by Soviet businessmen. It was also decided to hold the second auction on April 3. After the news of the initial auction was released, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita made a statement, stating that Japan did not participate in this auction and could not recognize the Japanese interests if any of the four auctioned fishing areas were involved, and declared that the Soviet Union should bear the responsibility for the incident. However, the world's public opinion believes that this claim by Japan is purely a bluff. In the 20th month of the war against China, Japan has no way to maintain the current situation, so how dare it challenge the Soviet Union, which has been recuperating for 20 years!

Sure enough, two days after Arita's statement, because the Soviet Union was unmoved, he then made a statement, stating that Japan was willing to automatically participate in the second auction of fishing grounds. In today's newspaper dispatch, it is also reported that the end of negotiations between the two countries may not be far away. Although we do not know the details of Japan's participation in this auction, it is already very clear that this time Japan must yield due to its internal weakness.

The course of this fact has indeed given China, which is in the war of resistance, a major lesson. First, Japan's yielding shows that China's war of resistance has indeed weakened Japan's strength, making it outwardly strong but inwardly weak. As long as China can continue the war of resistance, the date of victory is in sight. Second, Japan's yielding to the Soviet Union shows that only a firm and tough foreign policy can deliver a head-on blow to the aggressor. Therefore, to defeat Japan and stabilize the order in the Far East, China must resolutely resist, and other countries must use effective sanctions!

The inflow totaled $368,902,000, either in the form of securities trading or bank deposits. Among them, foreign purchases of U.S. securities totaled $48,895,000, and U.S. purchases of foreign securities totaled $75,653,000. After offsetting the two, the inflow of foreign capital into the United States totaled $26,758,000. In that year, deposits from South American countries in U.S. banks totaled $18,005,000, and deposits from Far Eastern countries totaled $77,082,000. Further analysis of the funds flowing into the United States still shows that the most came from Europe, totaling $388,655,000, but this is far less than in previous years. In 1935, the inflow totaled $1,200,598,000; in 1936, the inflow totaled $850,714,000; in 1937, the inflow totaled $601,727,000; and last year it dropped to $388,655,000. Year after year, the inflow of funds from various countries into the United States has been as regular as the tide. Since the global economic panic, from January 1, 1935, the total amount of foreign capital flowing into the United States has reached a huge $3,779,225,000. (26th Havas Dispatch)

### Continued Fighting in the Donghai Area of Northern Jiangsu

Taixian Correspondence: The focus of the war in Northern Jiangsu has gradually shifted to the Donghai and Shuyang areas. Although County Magistrate Zhu Aizhou led his team to resist in Shuyang County, Japanese reinforcements continued to arrive at Fangshan, southwest of Donghai. Fierce fighting has broken out in the Fangshan area. At the same time, 200 Japanese soldiers attempted to surround the Chinese army in Cangmafang, Shuyang. Both sides fought fiercely all day. The brave Chinese soldiers repeatedly charged and fought heroically, eventually annihilating all the Japanese soldiers. The houses in the western street of Cangmafang were completely reduced to ashes after being continuously bombarded by the Japanese army with artillery.

### Chinese Army Recaptures Shangxingbu; the Entire City Has Been Burned Down by the Japanese Army

Lishui Correspondence: On the 20th, the Central Jiangsu guerrillas advanced into Lishui County. A fierce battle took place between Lishui and Tianwang Temple with the Japanese Morita unit. As a result, the Japanese army was defeated and fled back to Tianwang Temple. All bridges on the highway five miles west of Lishui were destroyed by the Chinese mobile team. Shangxingbu has been recovered by the Chinese army. Shangxingbu was originally the most prosperous commercial area in Liyi. Lishui was lost and suffered no losses. Since it was occupied by the Japanese army, it has been wantonly ravaged, and the tragic scene can be seen everywhere. Before leaving, the Japanese army set fire to Shangxingbu, and all the houses in the city were reduced to ashes. All villages, large and small, within five miles of the highway were also burned down. As many as 40 innocent men and women were killed. The guerrillas have attacked Huangchi Town, which belongs to Gaochun County, and are fiercely fighting with the Japanese army there.

### Poland's Ambition Towards Germany Still on Military Alert; Germany Denies Making Demands on Poland; Switzerland Also Increases Defense on Border

Warsaw: Military preparations here are still actively underway, but in great secrecy. (27th Reuters Dispatch)

Warsaw: The rumor that Germany has made demands on Poland cannot be confirmed. However, it is generally believed that Poland has made military preparations because it believes that Germany may exert pressure to modify the Danzig situation. It is said that Poland is determined to take precautions to avoid being caught off guard. It is also said that Poland firmly opposes any concessions in the Polish Corridor. Recently, someone said that Germany may propose building a German highway through the Polish Corridor. (27th Reuters Dispatch)

(Paris) According to the right-wing newspaper London News, Germany sent a note to the Polish government on the 24th of this month, asserting that the issue of the Free City of Danzig should be resolved directly by Germany and Poland, without regard to the solution proposed by the League of Nations: (1) Germany should be allowed to enjoy certain rights in the city of Danzig; (2) The position of Polish High Commissioner should be abolished immediately; (3) The port of Danzig should still be used by Poland. (27th Havas Dispatch)

(London) According to the News Chronicle, Hitler presented a note to Poland, containing three points, demanding the virtual restoration of all German rights in the Free City of Danzig. The three points he requested are as follows: (1) Abolish the position of League of Nations Commissioner in Danzig; (2) Germany and Poland should effectively resolve the Danzig issue; (3) All rights in Danzig, except for certain port rights of the Polish side, should belong to Germany. (26th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Berlin) Yesterday, it was widely rumored that Germany had sent three notes to Poland one after another last week, demanding the return of the Free City of Danzig and the city of Otterburg, and allowing Germany to build a highway through the Polish Corridor to connect the German province of West Silesia with East Prussia. Germany will gather troops on the southern Swiss border. All these rumors have been dismissed as inaccurate by people who are unable to obtain reliable information here. (27th Havas Dispatch)

Swiss Capital: In order to be prepared, Switzerland has strengthened its border defenses and has issued orders to lay landmines to protect important locations such as highway bridges on the border. (27th Reuters Dispatch)

Swiss Capital: The Federal Council held a meeting this morning to discuss the international situation. It unanimously believed that the international situation has eased considerably, but it is regrettable that there are still rumors of German troops concentrating on the Swiss border. However, it was still decided that the training period for border troops and reservists (a portion of which was mobilized in January this year) and staff should be extended by two weeks, and officers and junior officers should also be retrained.

(London) Undersecretary Butler stated in the House of Commons today, guaranteeing that the recent changes in the international situation do not involve economic retaliation measures against Germany. (27th Reuters Dispatch)

### Britain Still Attaches Great Importance to Romania; Trade Mission to Depart Soon

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons this afternoon, "After the Romanian government signed a supplementary commercial agreement with Germany, it notified the British government of the content and stated that the agreement did not contain any provisions of a political nature or sacrifice Romania's economic independence. In addition, the British government has always attached importance to promoting trade between Britain and Romania and promoting bilateral economic relations. What I should state is that the British government had already decided to send a trade mission to that country. Since the Romanian government has expressed its hope that the trade mission can depart as soon as possible, the British government is willing to comply." (27th Havas Dispatch)

(Paris) Romanian Prime Minister Calinescu made a statement to a Paris Evening Post interviewer yesterday, stating, "One thing has been determined, that is, if Romania is attacked, no matter which country the aggressor belongs to, it should rise up to defend itself and use all its strength to maintain its territorial integrity. The commercial agreement recently concluded between Romania and Germany began negotiations in February of this year and is not related to the recent events in the international community. Romania's existing or future commercial relations with other countries will not be affected as a result." (26th Havas Dispatch)

### Germany Also Has Intentions Towards Yugoslavia; Seeks Commercial Rights

(Paris) The fact that three German deputies in the Yugoslav parliament were summoned to Berlin has sparked much discussion among political and diplomatic circles here. It is said that Germany has made commercial proposals to Yugoslavia, seeking to include the Yugoslav market within Germany's "area of vital concern." This measure directly conflicts with Italy's interests. Back when the Rome-Berlin Axis was formed (October 1936), the two sides divided their spheres of influence in the Danube region. Austria and Czechoslovakia were assigned to German control, while Romania and Yugoslavia were assigned to Italian control. Hungary was a joint sphere of influence of both Italy and Germany. The outline of this division was confirmed during Prime Minister Mussolini's visit to Germany in 1937. Subsequently, Austria and Czechoslovakia were either incorporated into Germany as provinces or became German protectorates. Romania was also forced to sign a commercial agreement with Germany, granting it huge economic benefits. As a result, Italy had to buy oil from the Soviet Union and, in order to recover the price, disregarded the fact that the Soviet Union was the target of the Anti-Comintern Pact and built warships for it. Now that Germany is expanding its influence to Yugoslavia, Prime Minister Mussolini must have realized this and, finding it unbearable, clearly declared in his speech yesterday that Italy's interests in the Adriatic Sea should be in a superior position. Until 1932, Italy regarded Yugoslavia as a formidable neighbor, with a coastline that was winding and everywhere a natural barrier for the navy, which could not be compared with Italy's flat and unsheltered coastline. In 1937, it signed a treaty of friendship with Yugoslavia, and the crisis posed by Yugoslavia disappeared. But if German forces now enter Yugoslavia, it will form a new crisis for Italy.

### German Army Occupies Seven Army Corps in Czechoslovakia

(Berlin) Lt. Col. Weidel, a German military officer who accompanied the occupation of Moravia and Bohemia, published an article in a newspaper today, stating that on March 15, the German troops that crossed the German-Czech border to occupy the provinces of Moravia and Bohemia consisted of seven army corps, drawn from the provinces of Silesia, Saxony, North Bavaria, and Austria, which entered Czechoslovakia in an encirclement from all directions.

### Spain: Negotiations Broken Off; Nationalist Forces Issue Final Warning Demanding Immediate Surrender or City Will Be Attacked

Madrid: As of now, there are no signs of an attack by the Nationalist forces. The city remains calm, save for the sound of anti-aircraft guns firing at twelve Nationalist bombers in the sky. The enemy aircraft did not drop any bombs. The police headquarters is crowded with people applying for passports. The road from Madrid to Valencia is filled with refugees. (Reuters, 27th)

Burgos: General Franco issued an ultimatum at 2:10 PM yesterday to the people in the areas controlled by the government forces, demanding an immediate cessation of resistance. He emphatically stated that since the Catalan campaign, the victory of the Nationalist forces has been universally recognized. Even the leaders of the government forces acknowledge the Nationalist's superiority. The outcome of the war is as clear as day. If the people in the government-controlled areas repent and cease resistance, the Nationalist government will be magnanimous, except for criminal offenders who will be tried by the courts. All military personnel and leftist party members will be given a chance to reform. (Haitong Telegram, 27th)

(Paris) According to news received here, the surrender of the Madrid government forces may occur within 24 hours. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, a government aircraft flew to Burgos and returned at 5:45 PM. The Nationalist authorities declined to disclose the identity of the government representative and the purpose of his mission, but it is widely believed to be for discussing surrender terms. According to sources in Madrid, when the Secretary of the National Defense Council, Rio, gave a speech yesterday, he read out a telegram sent by the government forces to Burgos the day before, stating, "A plane will be sent tomorrow as a symbol of surrender. Please inform us in advance when your forces will enter." (Haitong Telegram, 27th)

Burgos: Regarding the ongoing peace talks between the two sides in the Spanish Civil War, after the representative of the Republican government brought back the conditions proposed by General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, to Madrid, he arrived here again by plane at 3:00 PM this afternoon. He immediately continued negotiations with the plenipotentiaries appointed by General Franco, namely Police Chief Colonel Engel Ria and Intelligence Chief Colonel Gonzalo. They continued until 5:00 PM this afternoon, when he returned to Madrid on the same plane. According to general knowledge, General Franco demanded the immediate surrender of the Republican government and refused to continue negotiations. It is rumored that the Nationalist government has decided to launch a general offensive against Madrid, but due to heavy snow in recent days and blocked roads, it had to postpone the advance. Considering that the Nationalist forces launched an offensive on the central Cordoba front at dawn today, it is evident that the war may not be avoided. It is generally expected that although Madrid may fall without a fight, the other territories under the Republican government are not actually controlled by the National Defense Council. Unless force is used, it will be difficult to make them submit. (Havas Telegram, 26th)

Madrid: After the breakdown of the peace talks between the two sides in the Spanish Civil War, Secretary of the National Defense Council, Rio, delivered a broadcast speech, explaining the course of events. He stated that the peace delegation sent by the National Defense Council to Burgos had presented eight conditions for peace to the Nationalist government authorities: (1) The Nationalist government should respect the territorial integrity of Spain; (2) The Nationalist government should respect the combatants of the Republican government and should not treat them harshly; (3) Republican government combatants arrested by the Nationalist forces should be brought before ordinary courts for trial and should not be subjected to retaliatory measures; (4) The lives, freedom, and interests of government military officers and soldiers should be protected; (5) The lives, freedom, and interests of militia members should be protected; (6) The lives, freedom, and interests of Republican government civil servants should be protected; (7) Republican government personnel who wish to leave the country should be given a 25-day preparation period; (8) Italian troops and indigenous troops from Morocco in North Africa should withdraw from Spain. After receiving these conditions, the Nationalist government put forward two points in response: (1) The Nationalist government will not only not interfere with Republican government personnel who voluntarily leave the country, but will also guarantee their safety before leaving the country; (2) As a show of sincerity, the Republican government should transfer all military aircraft to the Nationalist government between 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM on the 25th of this month. The National Defense Council believed that the conditions attached to this answer could not be immediately implemented in practice, and therefore requested an extension of time. Unexpectedly, the Nationalist government suddenly ordered its plenipotentiaries to cease negotiations at 6:00 PM this afternoon and demanded that the peace delegation sent by the National Defense Council return to the government forces' positions. "Since our compatriots have been killing each other for over two years, this tragedy has no possibility of ending now. The responsibility for this should be borne by the Nationalist government. Although the main policy of the National Defense Council was to conduct peace talks, it will continue to work towards this in the future." (Havas Telegram, 26th)

Madrid: The peace talks between the two sides of the civil war have been declared broken. A broadcast message released here explained the breakdown, stating that after the National Defense Council presented eight conditions for peace to the Nationalist government, the Nationalist authorities had made a response, four of which were unacceptable to the National Defense Council: (1) Government military officers and soldiers who obeyed orders to defend the country were considered criminals; (2) Anyone who participated in the war to uphold their ideals was also considered a criminal; (3) Anyone who participated in political party activities and did not support the Nationalist uprising on July 17, 1936, in other words, members of all parties from the Republican Union Party to the Anarchist Federation, the Nationalist government would not guarantee their safety; (4) The Nationalist government would not guarantee the length of detention for criminals and stated, "They must be detained for a considerable period to encourage them to reflect." (Havas Telegram, 27th)

Madrid: The National Defense Council here has dispatched peace delegates to Burgos to negotiate with representatives of the Nationalist government for many days. The Secretary of the National Defense Council, Teodoro, announced in a radio speech today that the Nationalist government authorities have suddenly terminated the negotiations, and the peace talks have therefore broken down. The Nationalist forces are preparing to launch a general offensive in the near future, and the National Defense Council has no choice but to take defensive measures. (Havas Telegram, 26th)

Madrid: Residents here are puzzled by the government's failure to issue communiques regarding the peace negotiations. (Reuters, 27th)

Madrid: The National Defense Council has just issued a communique stating that the enemy forces on the Estremadura front launched a general offensive today under the cover of heavy artillery fire and occupied several of our army positions in the Pozoblanco area. (Havas Telegram, 26th)

### Japan-Soviet Fishery Negotiations Reportedly Shift; A Compromise Can Be Reached

(Moscow) According to Japanese sources, the prospects for resolving the Soviet-Japanese fishery dispute have improved. It is reported that the Japanese side is now willing to accept a temporary agreement and abandon its fishing rights in 37 fishing grounds. It is also reported that the Japanese side is willing to participate in the auction of fishing grounds in Vladivostok, provided that the Soviet Union guarantees that Japanese fishermen can obtain more than 200 fishing grounds and avoid competition from Soviet fishermen. Japanese representatives have stated that a solution may be reached within a few days so that Japanese fishing boats can sail into Soviet territorial waters before the start of the fishing season on April 10th. (Reuters, 27th)

(Moscow) According to a Japanese announcement tonight, after two hours of talks between the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Maxim Litvinov, and the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigenori Togo, the Far Eastern fishery issue has shown signs of compromise. Litvinov and Togo will meet again on Tuesday. Japanese sources here hope that this dispute can be resolved as soon as possible so that they can participate in the second unofficial auction of fishing grounds in Vladivostok on April 3rd. If this matter is not resolved, the Japanese hope that the second auction date can be postponed for several days, as they expect that if the second round of talks between Litvinov and Togo fails to resolve the fishery issue, it will at least be resolved in the third round. The main point of contention between the two countries is that 37 fishing grounds previously fished by the Japanese have been closed by the Soviet authorities for strategic reasons. The Soviet side intends to replace these 37 fishing grounds with other fishing grounds. (Associated Press, 26th)

### France Ready to Negotiate with Italy, but Needs Clarification on Three Demands

(Paris) After Italian Premier Mussolini's speech, the most important thing for the French side is that Italy publicly announced its demands regarding Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal, but did not mention Nice, Savoy, and Corsica. Many believe that France will take this opportunity to diplomatically explore the possibility of reopening negotiations. (Reuters, 27th)

(Paris) Italian Premier Mussolini's speech has been commented on by responsible sources here, who all say that the dispute between Italy and France has now officially become a diplomatic issue. The demands put forward by Italy are limited to Djibouti Port, the Tunisian protectorate, and the Suez Canal, but it is not yet certain whether they are territorial in nature. Until this point is clarified, it is impossible to determine whether France and Italy have the possibility of negotiating, and it cannot be determined for even a single day. In addition, all newspapers say that France has never refused to negotiate with Italy, but is unwilling to make any concessions on territory. Le Temps reported, "France has never refused to participate in any international negotiations, but if a certain country makes demands that infringe on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the French colonial empire, especially regarding the Tunisian protectorate, France will answer no." Le Parisien reported, "France has never refused to negotiate with anyone, but will never allow anyone to seize an inch of its land." (Havas Telegram, 26th)

(Paris) Local newspapers originally thought that Italian Premier Mussolini's speech yesterday would be very emphatic and provocative in nature. Now that they see it is so calm, they are not too worried. Le Journal reported, "Although the audience expressed their approval with applause in several sections of the Italian premier's speech, what he said did not add fuel to the fire, but rather aimed to preserve peace." The newspaper also quoted its Berlin correspondent as saying that the Italian premier did not congratulate Germany on its annexation of Czechoslovakia and the recovery of the Memel region. The Germans pretended not to care much about this. "They also avoided mentioning Mussolini's statement that Italy has superior interests along the Adriatic coast." Le Petit Parisien reported, "France has no demands on Italy. If the Italian government believes that France and Italy have the possibility of negotiating, why not communicate its wishes to the French ambassador to Italy, Ponte?" The right-wing Le Figaro reported, "Since Italy has demands, if it wants to know the French government's opinion, it should seek it through normal diplomatic channels." Le Temps reported, "After Germany's power increased greatly, Italian Premier Mussolini must have felt that Germany would one day advance towards the Adriatic Sea. However, he was encouraged by Foreign Minister Ciano and Fascist Party Secretary-General Starace to the point where he could hardly extricate himself." L'Oeuvre, the newspaper of the Radical Socialist Party, reported, "We do not know what Italian Premier Mussolini wants from us, nor do we know whether we can accept it, discuss it, or consider it intolerable. It is said that Mussolini's spokesman, Gayda, has made some statements, but what can the French government do if it cannot negotiate with the likes of Gayda?" Le Populaire, the newspaper of the Socialist Party, reported, "Mussolini is truly a disciple of Hitler, and his imitation of Hitler can be said to be meticulous, even down to the way he speaks to the masses. It is futile for us to try to find out any detailed information or his intentions in his speech. However, Mussolini's spokesman, Gayda, published an article in Il Popolo d'Italia on the day of Mussolini's speech, saying that there are still 3.5 million Germans in France, and the implication is clear." (Havas Telegram, 27th)

(Berlin) Today's newspapers carried articles authorized by official circles, stating, "Italy has now explained its historical rights to Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal through the words of its political leader, and the issue of resolving the dispute is now public and cannot be ignored." (Reuters, 27th)

(Berlin) Regarding Italian Premier Mussolini's speech in Rome yesterday, Berlin political circles believe that it is an important contribution to clarifying the policies of the Rome-Berlin Axis and therefore express their complete approval. Regarding the three points raised by Mussolini: Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal, Berlin believes that Mussolini has expressed his willingness to negotiate. How things will proceed in the future depends on France's response. Today's newspapers also published articles commenting on Mussolini's speech. "The Berliner Lokalanzeiger stated that the obstacles between France and Italy mentioned by Mussolini in his previous speech in Genoa have now been eliminated due to the change in the situation in Spain. However, this rift has not yet been completely healed." (Haitong Telegram, 27th)

(London) After Italian Premier Mussolini's speech yesterday, British newspapers have commented on it, unanimously believing that he intends to negotiate with France. As to whether it is beneficial for France to negotiate with him, opinions differ. The Times carried a dispatch from its Rome correspondent stating, "Although the Italian premier's speech mentioned the Rome-Berlin Axis, it has created an opportunity for France and Italy to resolve their disputes. If France can give Italy reasonable concessions, Mussolini is prepared and willing to be friends with France, but he will not forget his ties with Germany." The newspaper's diplomatic correspondent said, "The British government is currently studying the Italian premier's speech carefully. The initial impression of the general public is that the European situation has not become more tense as a result." (Havas Telegram, 27th)

### Whether Britain Will Implement Conscription Still Divides Opinions; Chamberlain Repeatedly Meets with Opposition to Request Cooperation in Strengthening National Defense Plan

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain met with the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Greenwood, at 10 Downing Street this morning for talks. People in political circles are paying close attention, saying that the government and the opposition Labour Party have been exchanging views repeatedly for a week. The purpose is to persuade the parties to cooperate with the government to strengthen the national defense plan so that it can be promoted more quickly. The matter will still be presided over by Prime Minister Chamberlain and participated in by the opposition, so it is not a cabinet reshuffle. In addition, Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons several months ago that he would never implement conscription in peacetime. Now he may ask the House of Commons to allow him to retract his previous statement when necessary. If so, a military conscription system may be implemented domestically first. (Havas Telegram, 27th)

(London) Regarding the issue of implementing conscription, semi-official circles here have released a communique authorized by the government, stating that the government has no intention of adopting conscription and does not intend to implement national mandatory registration. It stated that after Italian Premier Mussolini's speech this morning, the international situation has not only not deteriorated but has become more relaxed. If major changes occur in the international situation in the future and unexpected events cause it to erupt immediately, the government may reconsider the issue of implementing conscription. At that time, it may even invite the opposition parties to participate in a national cabinet. However, as far as the current situation is concerned, the realization of this proposal is still far away. Members of various parties in the government mostly oppose the proposal to implement conscription. When most members of the Conservative Party held a meeting one day, they considered promoting a "mandatory training plan" and believed that this plan was different from conscription. However, when discussing the content of the plan, opinions failed to converge. In short, because continental countries border other countries on land, they have to maintain large armies. The situation is different in our country. What we should pay attention to is that in the event of unexpected events in the future, we may take joint action with other countries. In this case, it is questionable whether we can fulfill our obligations without implementing conscription from beginning to end. (Havas Telegram, 26th)

(London) Well-informed sources here recently stated that the issue of implementing conscription is still of the greatest concern to the cabinet. The views of the cabinet members are not the same. Foreign Secretary Halifax fully supports it and has obtained Prime Minister Chamberlain's consent to some extent. However, Home Secretary Hall Nay and Chancellor Simon strongly oppose it. They all say that if the government extends the term of military service or implements conscription, it will never win the general election. It is said that the Imperial Defense Committee supports the establishment of a mandatory service system that is different from conscription. However, the opposition Labour Party opposes all kinds of mandatory service systems, regardless of their form. At the very least, they are unwilling to implement it under the leadership of Prime Minister Chamberlain. In short, how to decide on this issue depends on the rise and fall of the war crisis. (Havas Telegram, 26th)

(London) According to a Reuters parliamentary correspondent, there is no basis for the rumors circulating in some newspapers and elsewhere that Prime Minister Chamberlain will resign. It is said that the rumors of a cabinet split are mainly due to the issue of implementing conscription. (Reuters, 26th)

Stirling, Scotland: Opposition Labour MP Johnston, who once served as Lord Privy Seal, gave a speech here, expressing his opposition to conscription. He stated that the people should know why they are being conscripted. Members of our party will never fight for the cause of the empire. If France and Italy clash over Djibouti Port, our party will not want to be drawn into the vortex. To induce Mussolini to separate from Germany, the Suez Canal and Gibraltar should be internationalized. (Havas Telegram, 26th)

Dublin: Irish Republican President Eamon de Valera returned from Switzerland yesterday. He passed through London and met with Prime Minister Chamberlain in the suburbs of Coates Town to discuss the European situation. This matter is highly valued by Republican political circles, who are asking what the Republican attitude will be in the event of a European war. Regarding this, two different opinions have already emerged within the opposition Irish Unity Party when the House of Representatives recently discussed national defense issues. One part advocates strict neutrality, while the other believes that neutrality is impossible. The debate is fierce and difficult to resolve. Well-informed sources say that the Republican attitude in the future European war is important to the United Kingdom. It can take the opportunity to re-propose the issue of the unification of Northern and Southern Ireland. The Northern Irish Minister of Finance, Andrews, recently visited London and is said to have informed the British government of the concessions that Northern Ireland can agree to in order to facilitate the establishment of a settlement plan. (Havas Telegram, 26th)

Grimsby: Former Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech here this afternoon, advocating that all parties should immediately form a united national cabinet and unite all peace-loving countries in Europe to curb German leader Hitler's blind advance. He said, "At this point, all we can do is unite and work hard. We cannot waste another hour. We must work actively so that the whole world knows that Britain has woken up and is very sincere. There must be an immediate ceasefire between the parties and a new cabinet must be formed on the broadest basis. As for foreign affairs, Foreign Secretary Halifax issued a statement on the 22nd of this month expressing his willingness to unite all peace-loving countries in Europe to resist future German aggression. I believe that the government should step up the promotion of this policy, and it will be more likely to succeed if it can speak on behalf of all parties in the country. I firmly believe it. As for domestic affairs, the government must immediately take necessary measures on industrial resources and human resources to complete the maximum effort in military affairs in the shortest possible time. In short, if the government can promote this policy both domestically and abroad, it will undoubtedly promote national unity." (Havas Telegram, 26th)

### The New Fourth Army's Year of Anti-Japanese War: Experiences and Lessons

— Xiang Ying

Our Army's Course in the Anti-Japanese War

The New Fourth Army was established in a very short time, truly emerging from the midst of the Anti-Japanese War, which distinguishes it from other armies. It can be said that the establishment of our army has gone through four stages until today.

First Stage: Reorganization. The predecessors of our army were the Red Guerrilla forces and Red Army units scattered across the southern provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei. Since the July 7th, August 13th Incidents, the Red Army and Red Guerrilla forces in the southern provinces, in order to defend the Republic of China and strive for the liberation of the Chinese nation, were reorganized into the New Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army on October 2nd of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], according to the order of the Military Commission. In reality, the reorganization of our troops into the New Fourth Army began in January of the 27th year [1938], and it can be said that the formal completion of the reorganization took place in the 27th year. Although our troops were scattered across seven or eight provinces in the south, covering a vast area and consisting of many units, they were able to unanimously complete the reorganization of the troops under this order and the decision of the Chinese Communist Party. From January to mid-February of the 27th year was the period of reorganization for our army.

Second Stage: Concentration. One month after the reorganization, the New Fourth Army was ordered by Chairman Chiang [Kai-shek] to concentrate in two locations, north of the river to concentrate towards XX, and south of the river to concentrate towards XX. After February 10th, the second stage began, with the reorganized troops concentrating according to the designated areas. First, the First Detachment moved out from various garrisons on February 10th, followed by the Second Detachment and the Third Detachment continuing to advance. North of the river also gradually concentrated towards the XX area. Our military headquarters moved from Nanchang to southern Anhui on April 10th. Although the vast majority of our troops were more than two thousand li apart, and most of them marched on foot, they finally completed the concentration on April 10th. After the concentration was completed, the commander-in-chief of the war zone sent personnel to XX to inspect the concentrated troops. From February 10th to April 10th was the second stage.

Third Stage: The Advance and Deployment of Troops. When our troops had finished concentrating, we received an order from the commander-in-chief, instructing us to quickly advance and move to the combat areas to engage in battle. This was the order of April 15th. I remember that the mission assigned to us in the order was to form a guerrilla network in the designated areas, attack the enemy, disrupt their transportation, and build guerrilla base areas in the designated areas.

After our troops completed the inspection, they began to advance towards the designated areas and combat areas on April 28th. This was the day the vanguard of our army advanced. This vanguard was organized from a portion of our troops in the south of the river. Its mission was to understand and scout the advance routes and combat situations in order to facilitate the advance of the troops. After the vanguard set off, the main force troops followed in succession, advancing into the combat areas south of the river along with the vanguard. At the same time, our headquarters also moved to the southern section in May to command the entire army in combat. From April 20th to May, on the one hand, our troops advanced, and on the other hand, they engaged in combat after entering the combat areas. This was the third stage of our army's Anti-Japanese War.

Fourth Stage: Combat. After our troops advanced to the combat areas and formally deployed, they officially engaged in combat. (A) First, when the troops north of the river arrived at the designated combat area (May 16th), the enemy was attacking Hefei, attempting to cross the west bank on the east bank of Chaohu Lake. The first battle of our army began at Jiangjiahekoun. The result of the battle was the complete defeat of the enemy landing at Chaohu Lake. They captured eleven guns and one Japanese flag. This was the victory of our army's first battle north of the river. (B) Second, on June 18th south of the river, the first battle south of the river began at Weigang, south of Zhenjiang. It can also be said that it was the first decisive victory south of the river. This time, it was an interception of cars traveling south from Zhenjiang. Except for one that escaped, all were destroyed, and one Japanese Major Doi and one Captain Umeoka Takero were killed, and ten long and short guns, as well as other military supplies, and more than 7,000 Japanese yen were captured. This was the victory of the first battle south of the river. Since May 16th north of the river and June 18th south of the river, battles began, and the most intense battles were conducted south and north of the river. This type of combat was based on the mission given to us by the commander-in-chief, and the mission was completed through combat. This combat mission was still a guerrilla warfare mission. Until the end of September, we then received an order from the commander-in-chief, instructing our troops to take over the friendly forces' positions on the Qingyi River. On October 7th, one detachment went to the area along the Qingyi River to take over the positions. This was the beginning of our army assuming local positional warfare. In this stage, most of it was guerrilla warfare and a small part was positional warfare. In terms of the army's firepower, our army's firepower was very weak. Without strong firepower, it was impossible to assume positional warfare and conduct positional warfare. However, for the needs of the Anti-Japanese War, and to facilitate the operations of friendly forces on the same front, we had to reluctantly accept this mission and complete this mission. Some people say that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army do not fight positional warfare, and that they refuse positional warfare. People who say these things do not understand or misunderstand. We can say that our firepower is worse than any army. An army with weak firepower cannot assume positional warfare and cannot complete positional warfare missions. But for the sake of the Anti-Japanese War, as long as it is beneficial to the Anti-Japanese War, even if it means greater sacrifices, we must accept this mission and strive to complete it.

This explains the four stages of our army's Anti-Japanese War: the first stage, reorganization; the second stage, concentration; the third stage, advance and deployment; and the fourth stage, combat. These four stages are the experiences of our army in the 27th year of the Republic [1938]. (To be continued)

### Renewed Fighting Between Hungarian and Slovak Forces

Bratislava – According to news received here, although Hungary and Slovakia have declared a ceasefire, fighting has now resumed on the border. The artillery fire is quite intense, and there have been many casualties. Although the authorities hope to stop the war, they have been unsuccessful. Slovak political circles claim that the Hungarian side wants to occupy more territory in order to pressure Slovakia during negotiations to demarcate the boundary line. According to reports, border demarcation negotiations are scheduled to begin today in the Hungarian capital. (Reuter, 27th)

### The Fourteenth Dalai Lama Will Be Chosen by Drawing Lots from the Golden Urn

Scheduled to be Held This Winter

Presided Over by Wu Zhongxin and Reting

Chongqing Telegram – News from the frontier states that the reincarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, who passed away on December 17th of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], has already been found, and the Fourteenth Dalai Lama is about to emerge. This reporter made a special visit to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, the Tibetan Affairs Office, and Tibetans in Chongqing, spending an entire day in order to obtain a great deal of interesting news.

It is said that the location where the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama was discovered this time was in Qinghai. How was it discovered? It was based on the spiritual instructions obtained during sea gazing. This sea-gazing ceremony is held at Tengri Lake near Lhasa, presided over by Reting Hutuktu, the regent of Tibet. During the ceremony, a phenomenon similar to a mirage will occur on the surface of the sea.

Spiritual Manifestations. This phenomenon is used to make predictions. However, this phenomenon is not obtained by gazing at the sea only once. Since the Dalai Lama's passing, Reting Hutuktu has held the ceremony hundreds of times. Finally, results were obtained in the winter of the 25th year [1936]. What was revealed this time faintly contained the characters for Qinghai, so it was determined that the future Dalai Lama would be in Qinghai. After more than a year of searching, the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama was found in Xining, Qinghai, last autumn. Moreover, his birth date coincided with the Dalai Lama's death date, which fully complies with Tibetan religious regulations. In Tibet, the birth date coinciding with the Dalai Lama's death date is also a necessary condition for being designated as the Dalai Lama's reincarnation.

However, according to other sources, two children believed to be the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama were also found in the area northeast of Lhasa inhabited by Han Chinese in the spring of the year before last. According to Tibetan religious regulations, in addition to sea gazing, the Dalai Lama's last words can also serve as a basis for searching for the Dalai Lama's reincarnation. For example, if the Dalai Lama stated in his last words where he would be reincarnated, and a child whose birth date coincided with the Dalai Lama's death date is later found in that place, then that child can be considered the Dalai Lama's reincarnation. It is said that the children found in Lhasa were found based on this.

As of now, a total of three reincarnations of the Dalai Lama have been found. It is unlikely that there will be any new discoveries. As for how to determine which one of these is the true reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, a

Solemn Lottery

Ceremony will be held to determine him. This ceremony is conducted according to the Golden Urn Lottery Law established by the Tibetans in the 57th year of the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty (1752). It is said that in the past, the transmission of the robes and bowl of the lamas was always done by the "Chui Zhong" (i.e., after the lama's death, temporarily acting as the regent of Tibet, performing rituals to descend the gods and impartially designating the successor). The Golden Urn Lottery Law was established in the 57th year of the Qianlong Emperor. A jade urn is placed in the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, and the names of the children found to be reincarnations of the Dalai Lama are written on separate slips, which are then placed in the urn. The "Chui Zhong" then publicly draws a slip. Whoever's name is drawn will inherit the Fourteenth Dalai Lama. Those whose names are not drawn will also be given important positions, as it is believed that these children, although not the Dalai Lama's reincarnation, are also of divine origin. The host of this Golden Urn Lottery ceremony is Wu Zhongxin, the current chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, who has been ordered by the National Government to preside over the ceremony together with Reting Hutuktu, the current regent of Tibet. The date has not yet been determined, and it will have to wait until the child found in Qinghai is sent to Lhasa before it can be held. However, due to the difficulties of transportation between Qinghai and Tibet, it is estimated that the journey will take place in the winter of this year at the earliest.

### A Trip to Shao and Shan

A Prosperous Atmosphere in Counties Along the Highway

Rapid Advances in Industrial and Commercial Enterprises in Xingning

Shantou Correspondence – The Shao-Chao Highway not only connects the river basins of northeastern and eastern Guangdong Province but, because of its connection with the Shao-Lian Highway, can also be used to reach the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Its starting and ending points are, on the one hand, the center of Guangdong Province's rear defense during the Anti-Japanese War, the location of the war zone command and the provincial government, and on the other hand, the coastal area, the only commercial port in southern China after the fall of Guangzhou and the loss of Haikou, Shantou. In the current stage of the Anti-Japanese War in southern China, it is no accident that this highway, which serves as the artery connecting northeastern Guangdong Province, has attracted attention. This reporter returned from the interior and spent three days traveling the entire length of the highway. Due to the short time and the fact that I was traveling by car, what I saw was of course a cursory glance, but the journey along the way left some indelible impressions. After unloading my luggage, I rushed to write this for the reference of those who are concerned about transportation in the interior.

### Spring Arrives in Qujiang, Full of Vigor

When traveling east, it was just after the Lunar New Year. Firmly resolute people and a lively market, everywhere expressing a vigorous scene. Qujiang has taken on the mission of being the center of the Anti-Japanese War. In particular, the general civil servants, although living in extreme material deprivation, are all working hard and striving forward. This situation is indeed much improved compared to before the fall of Guangzhou. Transportation has also not encountered irreparable difficulties because the railway has been destroyed. Now, long-distance buses from various places are mostly running smoothly. Although there is a shortage of vehicles, the porters walking on the highway can also supplement the lack of machinery. Currently, most of the import and export goods from Hunan, Jiangxi, and northwestern Guangdong are gathered and distributed in Qujiang. In addition to being a military and political center, it is unexpected that Qujiang has also become the economic center of southern China.

### The Volume of Passenger and Freight Traffic on the Shao-Chao Highway Has Increased Sharply

This is because, in the current stage of the Anti-Japanese War in southern China, the import and export goods from Hunan, Jiangxi, and northwestern Guangdong mostly rely on this Shao-Chao Highway for transportation. Therefore, as soon as the vehicle transport opened, passengers and goods from various places poured in like a tide. Currently, the majority of people staying in the inns in Qujiang are merchants waiting for buses to travel east, and most of the goods piled up in the stores' warehouses are local products waiting to be transported east by bus. Merchants traveling east from the interior find it difficult to buy a bus ticket even after waiting in Qujiang for three or four days. Sometimes, due to the small number of tickets and the large number of passengers, they even use the method of drawing lots to decide who gets to buy a ticket. Although the fare is only 25 national currency dollars, some people are willing to pay two or three times more to ride on the freight trucks owned by various commercial firms. Currently, there are three or four companies on the Chao-Shao Road that transport goods in and out. They all have their own new-style light trucks, some with more than ten vehicles, others with two or three. They mostly transport daily necessities such as cloth and cigarettes to the interior, and transport local products from the interior. It is said that they have made a lot of profit recently. This is indeed a very speculative business in a time of national crisis.

### Very Good Impressions of Wengyuan and Lianping

After waiting for a few days for a passenger bus in Qujiang, the reporter knew that it would be impossible to buy a ticket in the short term. After much trouble, I finally boarded a freight truck traveling east. The freight truck departed at 7 a.m. on the 23rd of last month. There were a total of five freight trucks traveling together. The trucks were full of local products such as fruits from northwestern Fujian. After traveling for half a day, there was really nothing to see on the road except for the continuous mountains. At noon, we arrived at a market town under the jurisdiction of Wengyuan County, named Longxian Market. This market town is relatively prosperous in commerce because it is located at the confluence of the Furong River and the Zhen River, and because there is a highway that can directly reach Heyuan. After eating lunch in Pingli, we continued our journey. The car gradually drove into the territory of Lianping County, and the mountains on both sides gradually became steeper. After passing several dangerous slopes and several winding mountain foothills, we saw that the sky was approaching dusk. The village women gathering firewood and the yellow cows grazing still loomed among the weeds and wild smoke along the way. Thinking of the hardships of life in the mountainous areas and the hard work of the local people, one could not help but sigh. At 5 p.m., we arrived at Zhongxin Market under the jurisdiction of Lianping County. That night, because of the inconvenience of traveling, everyone split up and found inns in the market to stay overnight. Zhongxin Market also has highways that can reach Heyuan and Huiyang. The mushrooms and Jingpersimmons produced nearby are all transported out through this market. Since the Shao-Lake Highway opened to traffic, the commerce here has become even more prosperous. Because it is close to the Jiulian Mountains with steep ridges and layers of rocks, the terrain is also extremely dangerous. This is indeed an important place for the rear defense of the eastern front of Guangdong's Anti-Japanese War. It is said that the Jiulian Mountains here have thousands of paths and connect nine counties, which is enough to establish a strong fortress for Guangdong's rear defense.

### Xingning's Industry is Highly Developed

After spending the night in Zhongxin Market, we set off towards Laolong early the next morning. Because we were traveling through mountainous areas and remote suburbs, there was nothing along the way that was worth remembering. At 11 a.m., we passed Laolong, and the highway gradually progressed towards the lowlands. At 5 p.m., the car had arrived in Xingning. As soon as we arrived in the highly prosperous city of Xingning, we suddenly saw the modern urban facilities here and entered another world. Xingning's cloth industry was originally very developed. After the coastal cities were successively destroyed after the July 7th Incident, it relied on this industrial base to suddenly and rapidly develop. After the Shao-Chao Highway opened to traffic, its prosperity reached a fever pitch. Tens of thousands of merchants thronged the streets all day long. The chimneys of the factories spewed thick smoke day and night. In addition to the cloth industry, other industrial and commercial enterprises gradually established themselves. Factories for repairing automobiles, factories for manufacturing metal products, and even factories for manufacturing cigarettes could all be found here. The products were transported east along the Huiyang Highway and north along the Shao-Chao Highway. Undoubtedly, Xingning's industrial and commercial enterprises have replaced Guangzhou's past obligation to comfort the interior. The reporter continued on from Jieyang and arrived in Chaoan in the afternoon. After staying overnight, I took the train on the Chao-Shan Railway to Shantou, thus ending the journey on the Shao-Chao Highway.

Educational News

### Social Education Facilities in Zhejiang Province Since the Anti-Japanese War

Running People's Schools and Promoting Electrification Education

Organizing Wartime Service Mobile Teaching Groups

The Zhejiang Provincial Education Authorities regard social education as an urgent task for the Anti-Japanese War and national reconstruction. Mobilizing the people's grassroots work is an urgent matter. Therefore, since the war, they have spared no effort to promote the establishment of social education facilities. The following is a summary of the attitudes and facilities of Zhejiang Province in social education during the year after the war.

### Running Wartime People's Schools

The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education has been promoting supplementary education for out-of-school people in peacetime, and the need for it is even more urgent after the war. In addition to the 19 counties and cities, including Hangzhou and Hangxian, that have fallen into the war zone, which have been handled with separate measures, the "Provisional Measures for Running Wartime People's Schools in Various Counties and Cities of Zhejiang Province" have been specially formulated and promulgated, ordering various counties to uniformly run them. Wartime people's schools have now been planned one after another, and those that have been completed separately include 2,100 schools, 2,930 classes, and 118,668 students.

### Establishing the Bihu Implementation Area

Since western Zhejiang became a war zone, the social education agencies of the province suffered a disastrous fate, which greatly affected their work. Eastern Zhejiang is located in the rear, and the population has increased sharply. In order to meet the needs of the actual situation, the Bihu Social Education Implementation Area was established in Bihu Town, Lishui, in September of last year. The area has two groups, general affairs and teaching, which are engaged in promoting library reading, sports activities, and people's schools. After several months of operation, it has taken on a rough shape. This year, it was decided to increase personnel to conduct more concrete experiments.

### Promoting Electrification Education

Electrification education is a powerful tool for promoting culture and awakening the people. During the war, in order to expand its promotion, the "Zhejiang Province Implementation Plan for Broadcasting Education Network and Film Education Network" was specially formulated and implemented step by step. All electrification education personnel in the province were also summoned to hold a discussion meeting on electrification education work. Definite decisions were made on the production of anti-Japanese war films, the preparation of electrification education funds, and the improvement of film touring teams, in order to make long-term progress in electrification education work in the future.

### Supervising and Concurrently Running Social Education

The Zhejiang Province primary and secondary schools have been concurrently running social education for many years, and the results have been remarkable. In May of last year, the Ministry of Education ordered various schools at all levels to concurrently run social education, in order to eliminate the boundaries between schools and society, and to socialize schools and schoolize society. The Zhejiang Department of Education specially drafted a plan and issued a notice to all schools at all levels to strictly implement it. In addition, wartime service groups and mobile teaching groups were organized, which have seen rapid development compared to the promotion of social education before the war.

### Wu Zhihui Speaks on the Educational Problems in the Mind of an Outsider (1)

Strict Management in Education is Necessary to Avoid Failure

With National Crisis at Hand, Practice Economy by Setting an Example

(Chongqing Correspondence) Mr. Wu Zhihui, a veteran of the Party and the State, recently gave an academic lecture in Yu, responding to the joint office of Chinese Educational Academic Groups. The topic was "Educational Problems in the Mind of an Outsider." In terms of educational management, he quoted classics and elaborated extensively, emphasizing that education cannot be effective without strict management. Furthermore, with the country facing a crisis, he stressed the importance of practicing economy by setting an example and earnestly implementing it. His earnest words were enough to admonish current customs. The original text is recorded below:

Gentlemen,

Today, I am grateful to the joint office of Chinese Educational Academic Groups for allowing me to give a speech on educational issues. Because I am a complete outsider when it comes to education, today's topic is "Educational Problems in the Mind of an Outsider." It may be too absurd to have an outsider speak to you about the educational problems you are studying. However, today is a holiday, so please feel free to laugh. Moreover, for an outsider, even nonsense can serve as a reference.

In recent years, our leader, the President, has often mentioned the four words "guan, jiao, yang, wei" (管教養衛 – manage, teach, nurture, protect) in his instructions. Recently, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education also provided a very concise explanation of the meaning of these four words. In my layman's terms, "guan" (manage) means to make people do something and not allow them not to do it. "Jiao" (teach) is to tell them what they should do, so they must not fail to do it. "Yang" (nurture) means to cultivate their abilities. "Wei" (protect) means that once they have the ability to protect themselves, they can also protect the country and the people. As the saying goes, "guan jiao, guan jiao" (manage and teach), teaching cannot be without management. Nurturing and protecting both belong to the part of education. Therefore, the four words "guan, jiao, yang, wei" can be summarized as the two words "jiao yu" (教育 – education). Now, using my outsider's perspective, let me talk nonsense about "guan, jiao, yang, wei." What is "guan" (manage)? Nowadays, people often misunderstand the meaning of "guan," as if it is only to manage others, forgetting that those who manage others must first manage themselves. Therefore, when people hear the word "guan," they are not very happy. For example, when I walk on the street, I sometimes have to listen to the police's command and management. If I misunderstand the meaning of "guan" and think that I am a person of status and should not be managed by a mere policeman, then this is not right. The first condition of "guan" is to be able to manage oneself. Because managing oneself is the noblest thing. A person who waits for others to manage them is already inferior. If they still refuse to be managed, they simply lose their status. Therefore, it is best to be able to do it without anyone managing you, but to be able to reflect on yourself and know that you will never do anything that benefits yourself but harms others. If everyone does this, society will naturally achieve governance without management. When it comes to the question of whether or not to manage, one cannot help but talk about the goodness or evil of human nature. Many scholars throughout history have discussed the issue of the goodness or evil of human nature. Some say that human nature is good, some say that human nature is evil, and some say that human nature is both good and evil. In my personal opinion, let's not ask about human nature. I can presume that people are half good and half bad. The world's population will never be all good, nor will it be all bad. Think of an orange tree. The oranges on the tree will never all be big. Some will be good and big, and some will be small and bad. In short, "people's rights can be equal, but people's wisdom cannot be equal." Our Confucius also said, "Those above average can be told about higher things; those below average cannot be told about higher things." Who is considered an average person? The Book of Han has a distinction of nine levels of personality. I think four, five, and six are average people, one, two, and three are above average, and seven, eight, and nine are below average. Based on this classification method to distinguish people's goodness and evil, we can say that among a hundred people, there is one best good person in terms of goodness. In addition, there are four good people in terms of good and evil who are not easily corrupted. There are also fifteen good people who occasionally become bad. In terms of evil, there are also five bad people who are not easily turned good, and there are fifteen bad people who occasionally become good. Removing the ten at each end, the remaining sixty are what we call average people, because they can be good people or bad people. If we carefully examine the actions of people from all walks of life, we can prove that this statement is not very wrong. This theory can also be seen in political endeavors. Europe and the United States have party politics. They often divide into two major parties, conservative and liberal. Why do the members of the two parties have varying numbers? Because of the varying numbers, sometimes the Conservative Party is in power, and sometimes the Liberal Party is in power. According to party loyalty, once a person joins a party, they should not betray it. Then, however many are divided at once should remain unchanged forever. Why do they vary? This is because those above average will never betray the party, while those below average are mostly wavering elements who easily change, often suddenly conservative, suddenly liberal, shifting their support according to their likes and dislikes. Therefore, the ruling party follows them to power and follows them down. I dare say that no matter how culturally advanced or educationally developed a country is, at most only sixty-five out of a hundred people are good, and at least thirty-five are bad. Conversely, no matter how culturally and educationally backward a country is, there are always thirty-five good people out of a hundred, and at most only sixty-five bad people. In the first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Ding Fubao thought that I had worked in the education field and joked with me, saying, "I am willing to give one million yuan a day and ask you to teach all the people in the world to be good." I shook my head and said I couldn't do it. He then said, "Since it is not easy to teach them to be good, then I will give one million yuan a day and ask you to teach all the people in the world to be bad." I still shook my head. At that time, everyone who heard the joke also shook their heads. Now everyone must think that prostitution, gambling, and eating are things that everyone likes, and persuading people with prostitution, gambling, and eating will surely be pleasing to them. How would you know? You try standing on the streets of Shilihong to teach people prostitution, gambling, and eating. I guarantee that many people will slap you. This proves that my assertion that there are ultimately thirty-five good people is not very wrong. (To be continued)

### Specialist Schools Above the Xiang and E Provinces Are Being Relocated Again

Seven Schools including Tangshan Engineering College

The Ministry of Education recently ordered the schools originally relocated in Hunan and Hubei to find new locations for relocation. These include: (1) National Jiaotong University Tangshan Engineering College relocated from Hunan to Kunming, (2) National Jiangsu Medical College relocated from Hunan to Guiyang, (3) Private Wuchang Zhonghua University relocated from Yichang to Chongqing, (4) National Zhongshan University relocated from Luobao to Longmen, Guangxi, (5) Private Lingnan University relocated to Hong Kong, (6) Jiangsu Provincial Bank Specialist School relocated from Taoyuan to Qiancheng, (7) National Art Specialist School relocated to Yunnan.

### Fudan University Renamed National Xikang University

To be Relocated to Xikang from Chongqing

Shanghai Private Fudan University was completely destroyed by fire. Therefore, in addition to a part of the school remaining in Shanghai to start classes, it has also relocated to Chongqing to start classes. All school affairs are still the responsibility of President Qian Yongming and Vice President Wu Nanxuan. Considering the school's long history and satisfactory management, the Ministry of Education has ordered the school to relocate to Xikang and be renamed National Xikang University to cultivate talents for the border region. After receiving the order, the school is currently preparing for the relocation.

### Children's Welfare Association Extends Education for Newsboys

Fourteen Newsboy Schools Have Been Opened

Sports Meet to be Held After Children's Day

The Children's Welfare Association of this city has already established ten newsboy schools and has now increased the number to twenty-one. Fourteen schools have opened. The funds are raised by Chairman Chen Heqin and total more than 800 yuan. The Shen Bao donates 300 yuan per month. The original trial period was for six months and was scheduled to end at the end of April. It is now known that it has been decided to continue the funding. It is also heard that Cao Jingyuan, the principal of Peicheng Girls' Middle School in this city, donates 20 yuan per month and provides a classroom free of charge to run the newsboy school. Furthermore, the Association plans to hold a newsboy sports meet after Children's Day to promote newsboy sports.

### Ministry of Education Pays Attention to Elementary School Physical Education

Daily Morning Exercises to be Implemented

Implementation Guidelines Determined

(Chongqing Correspondence) The Ministry of Education believes that physical education is a basic necessity for self-defense. However, training cannot be effective if applied to adults or the elderly. It must first be applied to elementary school children to be effective. The importance of elementary school physical education is based on whether a person is healthy or not, which is developed in childhood. Especially during this period of intense resistance against Japan, it is even more important to vigorously promote it. The Ministry of Education has now ordered all public or registered private elementary schools in all provinces and cities to actively implement it in accordance with the Ministry's regulations. Morning exercises must be implemented every day before class. The implementation guidelines for elementary school physical education are recorded below:

A. Based on the school environment: (1) Venue, (2) Equipment, (3) Economy. B. Based on the student's level: (1) Exercise ability, (2) Knowledge ability. C. Based on local conditions: (1) Nature, (2) Habits. D. Based on the value of teaching materials: (1) Exercise can be done anytime and anywhere, (2) Inspire good behavior in children, (3) Others.

### Huaijiu Girls' Middle School Screens Students

Huaijiu Girls' Middle School has recently been holding student screening registration. The students to be screened are all the junior high school students in the South Campus (including seven classes: Autumn 3rd Grade A, Autumn 2nd Grade A, Grade C, Autumn 1st Grade A, Grade C, Grade D, Spring 2nd Grade A) and the entire junior high school 2nd Grade B class in the North Campus. In addition, there are several students in the senior high school grades 1 and 2 and the junior high school 2nd Grade B class. All students who are to be screened have been notified by the school to their parents by special letter, requiring them to fill out a guarantee letter and send it back to the school by registered mail before the 30th of this month, or ask the parents to bring the students to Weihaiwei Road for contact. Those who fail to comply by the deadline will be considered as voluntarily withdrawing from school.

Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign exchange market saw the British exchange rate supported by foreign firms and electricity companies, but the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank spared no effort to maintain a rate of 8 shillings and 2.25 pence. As a result, the situation remained unchanged. The US exchange rate should have softened slightly due to the continuous decline in the British-American exchange rate for two days. However, as Hong Kong Electric continued to sell, the final result was evenly matched, with flat trading. The Hong Kong exchange rate was relatively stable due to the equilibrium between supply and demand.

In the early morning, London's long-term and short-term interest rates were flat. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London gold prices did not fluctuate. The exchange rate of the British pound against the US dollar decreased by three cents, while remaining flat against the French franc and the Shanghai dollar.

The situation remained relatively stable. When the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's official rate was announced, it remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax also remained flat, still at 5.00%. Subsequently, foreign firms also bought US exchange rates at 16.09375 yuan from a certain bank. Following that, Hong Kong Electric suddenly sold US exchange rates at 16.125 yuan to Sino-Belgian. The Hong Kong dollar was slightly stronger. Near noon, overseas Chinese sold Hong Kong exchange rates at 55.375 yuan to foreign firms, resulting in a turnaround to flat prices.

### Securities: Government Bonds Turn Steady in the Afternoon

In the unofficial securities market yesterday, there was a tendency for continued gains. However, some speculators deliberately spread fabricated rumors in the market. Those who relied on hearsay for information sold off their holdings, while the rumor-mongers took advantage of the low prices to absorb. Market prices fluctuated accordingly. Finance Minister Kung's speech was related to foreign debt. Therefore, the market had already secretly turned towards gains after the market closed. Speculating on the future, there should be a rebound today. In the early morning, Hongda, Chengkang, Xie Da, and Dafeng, among others, were actively absorbing Class C shares. No. 38 absorbed Class E shares. However, the market price began to decline as Lianhe, Runli, Tiansheng, and Zhenkang, among other bulls, sold off their holdings. Excess longs emerged, and the price fell by 3 to 5 cents before noon. The market was quiet in the afternoon, and prices were stable. No. 5 bought Class A shares, and No. 20 and Dafeng bought Class E shares. Tongkang and No. 7 sold off slightly. Market prices varied, with highs and lows alternating. In the end, the total value of transactions was over 500,000 yuan, with a small decrease ranging from 2.5 cents to 5.5 cents. There were no transactions for the 96 shares. A summary table is listed below: Category - Highest, Lowest, Closing Price, Compared to the Previous Day; Unified A - 57.40, 57.25, 57.40, Down 0.25; Unified B - 51.55, 51.20, 51.25, Down 0.45; Unified C - 51.30, 50.75, 50.80, Down 0.55; Unified D - 50.05, 49.60, 49.70, Down 0.50; Unified E - 50.25, 49.75, 49.90, Down 0.45

### Foreign Currencies Fluctuate with an Upward Trend

Last Saturday, the price of pure British gold remained unchanged, and the British-American exchange rate decreased by 0.0625. Yesterday, foreign exchange transactions in Shanghai were very active among electricity companies and foreign firms. The supply from Hong Kong Electric and banks was smooth, and market prices were stable, with no clear winners or losers. The opening price was quite firm, and bullion shops and retail investors actively bought, causing market prices to rise gradually. However, gold shops and money changers sold off at high prices, causing prices to fall again. The market continued to fluctuate. In the afternoon, investor sentiment was uncertain, the market was sluggish, and transactions were very rare. The demand for British and American gold pounds was not high. The flow of British and American gold notes was still active, and foreign banks actively absorbed them, leading to a firm trend. There were very few transactions at the association. Only Hengmao sold and Xiangkang bought 20 American gold pounds. Yesterday's market prices showed an increase of 1 cent for British gold notes, 3 cents for American gold notes, 1 cent for Singapore notes, and a decrease of 5 cents for Dutch notes. Canadian notes increased by 2 cents. There were no changes in other currencies.

### Discount Rate Unchanged

### Yarn & Cotton: Inventory Accumulates Daily, Yarn Prices Decline Sharply, 20-Count Shuangma Falls Below 10 Yuan, Potential for Equalization of Chinese and Japanese Yarn Prices

The yarn market continued to decline, and the downward trend intensified. This was due to sluggish demand and difficult transportation, leading to a daily increase in existing stock. Furthermore, warehouse owners, recognizing the unfavorable environment, were reluctantly selling off previously stored goods. Banks were also trying to unload their holdings, further exacerbating the oversupply situation in the market. As a result, market prices declined sharply. Most market brokers were entrusted to sell, causing the market to become chaotic and exhibiting clear signs of panic. Market prices declined steadily. 20-count Shuangma yarn was generally regarded as the standard by speculators, and the large number of long and short positions amplified the downward trend. The prices at the foreign warehouses had broken through the 370 yuan mark, with the lowest price reaching 367 yuan in the afternoon, a drop of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. However, buyers were scarce and hesitant to try, reflecting the extreme level of fear.

Regarding the current yarn situation, few industry insiders expressed optimism at the opening of the market this morning. Most stated that the demand was too weak and that it was difficult to maintain a foothold in the market. Most were also disheartened. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was slightly lower at 376 yuan, with 15 bales traded among peers. Shortly after, reports of weak sales caused market prices to decline steadily. The market only heard selling voices and saw no buyers. The price kept going lower. The lowest price reached 371.5 yuan, with warehouse prices at 370 yuan. Afterwards, some bulls bought, pushing the price back up by 2 yuan. The current price was 373.5 yuan. In the afternoon, the market was deserted, with few people around. Market prices immediately fell by 3-4 yuan, and selling pressure suddenly increased, further weakening the situation. Due to certain rumors, the closing price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 367 yuan, with warehouse prices at only 366.5 yuan. In the end, the total trading volume for various syndicates in the morning was 1,605 bales. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn fell by 10.05 yuan, Tiannv by 8.5 yuan, Muyang by 6 yuan, and others by 4-5 yuan. The decline in 10-count coarse yarn was more moderate, only 2-3 yuan, due to uninterrupted sales in Tianjin. Shenxin Factory opened with 250 bales of 10-count Tongzijun yarn at a price of 289 yuan. Yesterday, 30 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped from Sichuan to Wenzhou, and today 10 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong and 200 pieces to Shantou. The volume of yarn purchased by various syndicates is listed on the left: Peers: 760; Fujian: 25; Shantou: 35; Tianjin: 545; Yunnan: 115; Hong Kong: 105; Wenzhou: 10; Inland: 10; Total: 1,605

The Japanese yarn market remained stable, as investors were optimistic and large players were mostly in long positions. As a result, the frequent declines in Chinese yarn did not affect Japanese yarn. Some said that Chinese and Japanese yarn prices may equalize in the future, so the price of yarn for the following month is expected to remain strong. The current price for 20-count Shuiyue yarn is 390 yuan, and the current price for 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 331 yuan.

### Cotton Also Falls with Yarn, Factory Purchases Halt

Regarding the external cotton market, New York cotton prices initially rose due to positive livestock feed reports and slight purchases from Wall Street. However, most industry players adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards the cotton market, awaiting developments in Washington. However, the information coming out of Washington was extremely contradictory, with reports of the Smith proposal being implemented and rumors of the US government's cotton export subsidy bill being passed by Congress, causing considerable uncertainty. Yesterday, New York rose 2 points per pound, and Indian White Baloch rose sharply by 2.5 rupees in April and May due to speculative manipulation. Egyptian rose 10 points per pound. Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was slightly tight. Converted to legal currency, cotton prices increased by 0.5 yuan per bale for American and Brazilian cotton, 1 yuan for Indian cotton, and 1 yuan for Egyptian cotton.

In the Shanghai cotton market, as yarn prices have been falling for five consecutive days, and rumors of negative news from Nanchang spread yesterday, causing yarn prices to fall another 10 yuan, most factories have halted their purchases of raw cotton. However, the cotton inventory of each factory is very low, and the Indian cotton ordered earlier has not been delivered on time, causing considerable anxiety. In the future, attention will be shifted to American cotton. Yesterday's prices of external cotton are listed below: Raw Material - Grade - Delivered to Factory Including Tax; 60-count Egyptian Cotton, High Grade - 107.10; Also, Medium Grade - 104.20; 80-count, High Grade - 131.00; Also, Medium Grade - 120.85; 20-count American Mitterlin - 84.30; Also, Low Grade - 71.20; 32-count, 93.00; Also, Low Grade - 82.15; 42-count, 94.85; Also, Low Grade - 83.05; Also, South American Brazilian Cotton, High Grade - 88.60; Also, Medium Grade - 85.30; Also, Low Grade - 76.15; 50-count, Indian Pingguoer - 62.50; 16-count, Indian Omala - 65.10; 20-count, 72.85; 24-count, Indian White Baloch - 80.25; 32-count, American Xinter - 85.45; 32-count, American Pengjiapu - 89.85; 42-count, American Pengjiapu - 89.85

The business of domestic cotton is increasingly sluggish. However, the demand for velvet cotton is still relatively strong. Market sentiment has slightly eased due to the continuous sharp decline in the yarn market, but cotton inventories are weak, so the decline is minimal. Huoji fell by 2.5 cents compared to the weekend, and Tonghua fell by 5 cents. The source of supply from Subei is gradually becoming smoother. Yesterday and today, 1,372 bales of Tongzhou Xiasha cotton arrived. The current cotton trading situation is as follows: 5,800 bales of Zhejiang cotton arrived; Tongzhou cotton, 79.50 yuan, purchased by peers, 170 bales, bank transfer, warehouse delivery; Huoji cotton, 71.25 yuan, also, 1,000 bales, cash; Also Huoji cotton, 72.00 yuan, also, 1,000 bales, cash; Te Yao Yi, 67.00 yuan, purchased by Yong'an Factory, 1,000 bales, bank transfer, delivered to factory.

### Piece Goods: Singapore Purchases of Colored Bleached Cloth are Strong

The situation in Zhejiang and Eastern China has stabilized. Shipping to Ningbo and other ports has returned to normal. Local sales have been reduced because buyers from Hunan and Jiangxi have stopped purchasing, and the sales area has shrunk. Furthermore, the exchange rate between Shanghai and Ningbo has recently risen sharply from 23 yuan per thousand to 69 yuan per thousand. As a result, most of the ordered goods have been retained in Shanghai. Only a small portion of the goods that are urgently needed for sales are still being shipped. Guangdong merchants continued to purchase 150-160 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill of various brands, including Fugui, Diqiu, Jiaopinglian, and Renzhong, and over 100 cases of colored cloth, colored twill, and poplin. Dyeing factories in this street purchased 150 pieces of undyed fine twill. The sales of woven cloth and fine cloth are weak. Retailers and warehouse owners have been selling off their holdings at reduced prices of 5-10 cents in recent days. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan are still actively purchasing over 100 cases of bleached cloth, bleached twill, colored cloth, and printed cloth. Singapore purchased over 1,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and colored twill from overseas. The sales of colored cloth and bleached dyed cloth have remained largely unchanged, while the sales of bleached fine twill have increased by 10 cents per piece due to the rising prices of undyed cloth.

The market for white cloth from Eastern China is weak. The sales of fine cloth and fine twill have decreased by about 5 cents per piece. 12-pound Longzhao fine cloth and fine twill are both selling for 12 yuan in the market. There is little trading with foreign merchants. Dyeing businesses in this street continued to purchase over 800 pieces of various brands of cloth.

Yesterday, 168 pieces of imported piece goods arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin. Today (28th), 350 pieces will be exported to Shantou, and 55 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Lack of Spring Overcoat Materials, Non-Chinese and Non-Western Styles Suddenly Unpopular

The retail and wholesale trade of woolens and fabrics remained strong yesterday. There is a shortage of spring overcoat materials in the market, creating opportunities for the sale of Harris Homespun and other materials. Yesterday, ordinary Harris Homespun from England was selling for 8.5 yuan, and No. 1 Harris from England was selling for 10 yuan wholesale. Domestic Tianjin Renli plain-colored fabrics were selling for 5.5 yuan, and plaid fabrics were selling for 6.5 yuan.

The sales of non-Chinese and non-Western fabrics have been lacking recently. There have been few large transactions, except for a small number of retail sales. It is rumored that many merchants have been warned to donate to relief organizations such as the Red Cross and refugee organizations, which has caused them to become fearful.

### Food: Affected by Dumping of Foreign Flour, Local Flour Mills Reduce Prices Again, Northern Merchants' Prices Only 4.40 Yuan, Large Quantities of Foreign Flour Sold to the North

The prices of flour mills continued to fall sharply. Because of foreign flour dumping, local merchants' demand for local flour has decreased daily. Forced by the environment, each factory had no choice but to cut prices to compete with foreign flour. Therefore, yesterday's factory price for No. 2 flour, except the wholesale price which decreased by 5 cents to 4.55 yuan, was only 4.5 yuan for merchants' prices. It was also heard that Northern merchants had a special price of 4.4 yuan for Pao Che flour. The market situation was quite chaotic. The total volume of transactions was over 100,000 bags including those from local and Northern merchants. Because of continuous arrivals of foreign flour, the future of local flour may be difficult to develop for the time being. Today, 17,500 bags of flour and 8,500 bags of bran will be shipped to Shantou.

The market situation for foreign flour is that existing orders remain strong, because the production price has remained steady these days. The price of May delivery foreign flour needs to be 4.6 yuan per bag. Buyers are afraid of being crowded out when the new wheat arrives, so there have not been any new transactions. As for the existing supply in the market, it is becoming increasingly abundant. Recently, many Northern merchants have been buying foreign flour in Shanghai. Yesterday, Zhenxing Company sold 20,000-30,000 bags of Bat Brand Standard No. 2 foreign flour to Northern merchants. The price increased from 4.4 yuan to 4.5 yuan (bank transfer price). The retail sales of existing foreign flour are relatively flat because the price of local flour is already lower than foreign flour.

The wheat market remains stagnant. There are very few retail arrivals. Most of it is directly sent to factories and assigned customers. In the official market, amid the falling price of flour, there may still be a fight.

### Locally Produced Xian Rice Rises

The purchases of locally produced Xian rice are active by both merchants and hoarders. Retail sales in this street are also very fragrant because the price of locally produced Xian rice is more suitable and tastes extremely delicious. Therefore, the total daily transaction volume increased to 3,600-3,700 bags. The high and decided prices from each stall unanimously increased. Nanjing Xian rice opened at 13.15 yuan to 12.89 yuan. Wu Xian ranged from 12.89 yuan to 12.35 yuan. Prices were 10-15 cents higher than the previous day's prices. Saigon rice, after opening at a low price last week, retail sales gradually became active. Yesterday, as locally produced Xian rice continued to rise, the seller's asking price increased to 17.12 yuan.

### Japonica Rice Sales in Street are Normal

Yesterday, the sources of supply from each syndicate, He Xia, arrived with over 1,000 bags of rice. The market sentiment was still good in the early morning. Traders were actively buying, so the situation continued to be tight. The prices of thick and thin Japonica rice were slightly higher by a few cents to 10 cents. However, because local sales were normal, the evening market became flat. The situation of Du Yang Jian Pu Jian was similar to that of the Japonica rice market. The price still remained in equilibrium between supply and demand, maintaining the original price.

### Australian Wheat Continues to Arrive, 260,000 Bags of American Flour Arrive in Shanghai, The Highest Import This Month

The continuous arrival of Australian wheat has already been noted in this newspaper. The Barbara Marie of Paulie Foreign Firm arrived with 7,500 tons of foreign wheat. It is berthed at the 13th or 14th buoy, and unloading is underway. It is heard that the company will have the Solvus ship with wheat arriving in Shanghai on the 5th of next month. The quantity has not been confirmed. Regarding the recent rumor that 260,000 bags of American wheat flour have arrived in Shanghai, after inquiring with each party, there has not been such a large volume of wheat flour imported this month. Perhaps it is still en route. According to the shipping industry, it is probably impossible for a ship to carry such a large quantity (of bags).

### Oil Cakes: Crude Oil Rises Sharply with a Slight Decline, Soybean Oil is Controlled by Japanese Merchants, Soybean Cake Trading is Still Lively

Crude Oil: The market situation has weakened because Qingdao has indicated that it can release the previously agreed-upon oil, so people's hearts are tired. However, under the heavy taxation of the unified system, the selling price is probably not easy to be too cheap. Yesterday, only 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were sold at a price of 29 yuan and 28.8 yuan. This fell 2 cents from the weekend.

Soybean Oil: The market situation is entirely controlled by Dalian. The market was slightly soft in the early morning, causing people to be uneasy. Later, positive news was frequently transmitted from Dalian, and the market atmosphere improved, with strong buying enthusiasm and strong price increases. The final price increased by 30-50 cents compared to last weekend. However, at the close of the market, Xintai, operated by a Japanese merchant, sold 300-400 barrels for May delivery at a price of 32.3 yuan, which was 6 cents different from the highest price of the day. Therefore, the underlying trend today may be unstable. Yesterday, the total market traded 200 cans of factory-canned oil at a price of 26.8 yuan, 100 pieces of Fengnian oil, 50 pieces of Yanqi oil, and 50 pieces of Da Xiao oil. The total amount of existing Dalian oil agreed to be opened for delivery was over 2,000 barrels.

Soybean Cake: For existing stock, Quanzhou merchants purchased 1,500 pieces of Changzhou Sipai cake at a price of 3.39 yuan, and 2,000 pieces of Da You brand cake at a price of 3.47 yuan and 3.48 yuan. A batch of Jiangbei Xiaobing was traded on Sunday, with the price being the original price of 6 cents. Both the spot price and the futures transaction were lively, and the market was slightly tighter. Transactions for April delivery were 3,000 pieces at a price of 3.13 yuan. Transactions for May delivery were 3,000 pieces at a price of 3.15 yuan. Transactions for June delivery were over 20,000 pieces at a price of 3.17 yuan and 3.18 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Soybeans Sell Well and Rise Sharply, Futures Dalian Soybeans Market Stalls

Yesterday, both futures and spot yellow soybeans turned to rise. The Dalian futures soybeans for April delivery rose due to the rise in the Dalian market. Japanese merchants had no intention to sell, and the market stalled. Only one car was traded at a price of 8.33 yuan, which was 3 cents higher than last Saturday. Guangxia local merchants actively purchased existing soybeans. In a situation with few goods, the market rose sharply by 7-8 cents. One car of Dalian soybeans was traded at a price of 8.44 yuan, and 1,300-1,400 bags of Chongming Sha Huang were sold at a price ranging from 8.3 yuan to 8.57 yuan.

Yesterday, 885 bags of soybeans arrived from Tianjin, and today 600 bags will be shipped to Hong Kong.

A few bags of Qing slices were offered at 11.3 yuan, based on Chaozhou standards. According to Shantou telegrams, the train station was indeed bombed, but it was not related to the city, so the market price was not greatly affected. It was found that 990 bags of sugar arrived in Shantou yesterday, and another 2,585 bags were transported from Hong Kong.

### Silk & Tea: Double Palace Factory Silk Rises to 1,040 Yuan

The overseas silk market, the opening price in Yokohama has slightly decreased, spot and near-term futures each fell by over ten yuan, long-term futures are slightly two yuan, New York Saturday no market, the Shanghai silk market still lacks turning points, factory silk and native silk foreign merchants are not asking.

### Coal: Pacific Bituminous Coal Newly Arrived with Over 1,000 Tons

The situation in the coal market is very clever, the volume of sales to each factory is vast, the purchasing intention of merchants is also thick, therefore, the circulating goods in the market feel lacking again. Some time ago, a foreign firm had Pacific bituminous coal newly arrived, lumps and powder together were over 1,000 tons, at the wharf in Pudong, entrusted to a certain business to manage the sale, the price per ton, was 37 yuan for the face lumps, 35 yuan for the general coal, 34 yuan for the coal powder, delivery from the warehouse, and other fees were added.

### Metals: Raw Material is Lacking in 本釘, Production From Domestic Factories is Extremely Little

### Hua Army in Eastern Zhejiang Firmly Defends Original Positions; Japanese Merchants in Hangzhou Prepare to Withdraw; Guerrilla Warfare to be Launched in Western Zhejiang

Since the Japanese army attempted something in Eastern Zhejiang and secretly landed at Wenjia Yan, Dongsha Zhou, on the banks of the Fuchun River, they have been completely annihilated after a fierce counterattack by the garrison. To contain Japanese forces, the Chinese army has gathered a large force to launch a general offensive towards Hangzhou, preparing for a large-scale attack. According to a telegram received by sources in this city, a certain unit of the Chinese army has secretly crossed the Qiantang River and advanced to the north bank, adopting a large encirclement strategy against Hangzhou. As for the coastal areas of Eastern Zhejiang, the troops of Generals Huang Shaohong and Liu Jianxu, as well as the Eastern Zhejiang Security Brigade, are stationed in various key areas with substantial strength. Although the military situation in Jiangxi Province is tense, it is not affected.

Japanese Merchants in Hangzhou Prepare to Withdraw

According to a certain passenger who arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday morning, after Hangzhou fell, the Japanese established a puppet regime and actively tried to revitalize the city. However, there are few Chinese residents, and those who remain are mostly from the poor class. The majority of residents are Japanese. The Qixiaying and Yanling Road areas of Hangzhou, which used to be bustling, are now mostly occupied by Japanese who have forcibly seized shop bases to open stores. Since the outbreak of the Eastern Zhejiang war, the previously quiet Eastern Front has become tense again. The Chinese army has crossed the river to launch a general offensive against Hangzhou, so the Japanese army in Hangzhou is extremely frightened. Most Japanese merchants have packed their bags and are preparing to evacuate when necessary. Many Chinese residents living in Zha Kou and other places are also fleeing, creating a rather chaotic situation.

Japanese Planes Bomb Yangguang Mountain in Yuyao

Furthermore, according to a telegram received by the aviation industry from Ningbo, at 4 PM on the 26th, three Japanese planes flew over Yuyao and dropped twelve bombs on Yangguang Mountain. It is reported that most of them landed in the wilderness, causing little damage. It is also learned that a large number of Japanese warships are still gathering in Hangzhou Bay, attempting something in Eastern Zhejiang. On the evening of the 24th, they shelled Linshan An and other places in Yaobei Township on the south bank of Yuyao. The Chinese garrison calmly awaited and did not retaliate.

Guerrilla Warfare to be Launched in Western Zhejiang

Zhou Enlai, Deputy Minister of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, has been inspecting defenses in Zhejiang with Chairman Huang Shaohong for several days and is very busy. After returning to his hometown province within days to visit relatives, he will go to southern Anhui for inspection and meet with Chairman Xiong Shihui of Jiangxi in Nanchang. Zhou has already drafted a work plan to dispatch a part of the New Fourth Army of southern Anhui to Zhejiang Province to launch guerrilla warfare. He is currently discussing it with Commander Gu and Commander-in-Chief Liu Jianxu, and it will be implemented soon. The military defenses of Zhejiang Province will become more solid in the future. As for the current allocation of military defense duties: (1) The coast is garrisoned by the troops of the Wenzhou-Taizhou and Ningbo defense command headquarters, and the security team of Xuan Tiewu, director of the Zhejiang Security Department; (2) Defensive works have been built on the south bank of the Qiantang River, garrisoned by the troops of Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Huang Shaohong; (3) The troops of Xiang Army's Liu Jianxu are garrisoned along the Fuchun River and other places. A Japanese invasion is definitely out of the question.

Japanese Warship Damaged Outside Zhenhai Port

On the evening of the 24th, several Japanese warships were anchored in the waters off Ligang outside Zhenhai Port. The Zhenhai Fortress artillery was ordered to open fire and bombard the Japanese warships. It is reported that one ship was hit by artillery shells and damaged. The Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port have now sailed elsewhere, but Japanese warships frequently patrol the waters off Eastern Zhejiang. More than ten Japanese warships are concentrated in Hangzhou Bay and have not sailed elsewhere. A Japanese warship sailed from the northeast to the waters off Mount Putuo Luojia in the early morning and anchored near Xiadang. It set sail that night. The Japanese aircraft carrier anchored off Chumen in Wenzhou has also sailed elsewhere.

### Jiangnan Shipyard Destroyed by Plainclothes Team; Japanese Army Blockades Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway; Japanese Warship at Yanglinkou Attacked by Gunfire

The Nanshi area was suddenly under martial law the day before yesterday (the 26th), and water and land transportation on the Jiangmian River above the 16th Pier was also blockaded by the Japanese army. According to investigations, the night before last (the 25th), a Chinese plainclothes team of over a hundred people surrounded the Jiangnan Shipyard, which was occupied by the Japanese army, and launched a fierce attack on the shipyard. Although the Japanese troops stationed there resisted with all their might, they failed to drive away the plainclothes team. As a result, more than ten Japanese soldiers were killed, and the plainclothes team left unscathed. Most of the shipyard was destroyed. Afterwards, the Japanese announced martial law and searched pedestrians, but found nothing. Because "face" was at stake, the incident was not disclosed.

Strafing a Transport Ship

The Japanese No. 1 transport ship, carrying military supplies and food, sailed from the Huishan Wharf to Jiangbei to resupply the Japanese army. The day before yesterday (the 25th), when it sailed to Yanglinkou, it was strafed by guerrillas using dense machine-gun fire. Dozens of Japanese soldiers drowned, and the losses were enormous.

Blockading the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road

Since the Central Regular Army and guerrillas have advanced in a roundabout way towards the Jiangnan area, the Japanese are extremely alarmed. The Japanese army in Hangzhou has blockaded the traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, attempting to cut off the connection between the Regular Army and the guerrillas, and has piled up a large number of obstacles. Jisha Island, which is more than 200 miles away from Shanghai in the Zhejiang sea, is now garrisoned by a powerful Chinese guerrilla force, which has expanded its organization and gathered over

Two Hundred

Strong, with substantial strength. It also has a large marine sailing fleet engaged in maritime guerrilla warfare, operating from time to time outside the mouth of the Yangtze River, posing a major threat to the Japanese. The commander of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Landing Forces, Totsudo, suddenly drew 2,000 naval personnel on the evening of the 24th, bringing small steel cannons, light and heavy machine guns, and other weapons, and also

Conscripted En Masse

A hundred and fifty pseudo "members" of the pseudo-Greater Shanghai Youth Corps, which the pseudo-"municipal government" had organized last year, were attached to the ship to attack the island. Fearing that the shoals around the island would make it difficult to attack, they also transported 40 rubber dinghies. They also drew Japanese translators and newly organized pseudo-"Constitutional Police" from various places to avoid language barriers. When these pseudo-personnel departed, except for the translators, the rest were forced to carry short guns and grenades, but the mission was not specified. On the 25th, the transport ship had already arrived outside Hengsha Island and was lowering the rubber boats one by one in order to

Transport Troops to Attack

They also instructed the pseudo-"Youth Corps members" to be the vanguard. At that time, the guerrillas on the island, seeing the Japanese action, were all waiting in strict array on the beach. Just as a gale and rain were raging, fearing that landing on the island would result in huge losses, they ordered a retreat to Shanghai, each returning to their original defense, canceling the attack on the island. The pseudo-"Youth Corps members" who were forced to fight were extremely frightened and returned, all rejoicing and congratulating each other. Fearing that the Japanese army would conscript them a second time, many fled in the previous two days.

### More Than 30,000 Wounded Japanese Soldiers Remain in Shanghai

According to someone from Hongkou, the Gongda Spinning Factory has been converted into a storage depot for aircraft materials and ammunition. But since the start of the Yangtze River war, Japanese military hospitals everywhere have been overflowing, unable to accommodate them. Even in Shanghai, the hospitals in Longhua and other places in Nanshi, and one place in Wusong, were already full. Therefore, the Gongda Spinning Factory, the largest building in Hongkou, was converted into a Japanese military hospital. In the months since, it has accommodated wounded soldiers. Excluding deaths, there are currently over 35,000 people.

### Italian Ambassador Left Shanghai Yesterday

### Chinese Cotton Mills Lack Raw Materials; Order Foreign Cotton for Supply; Foreign Cotton Imports Have Increased Sharply Since January; Domestic Cotton Exported to Japan for Manufacturing Ammunition

Since the Japanese puppet regime controlled cotton in its occupied areas, the amount of cotton exported to Japan has increased sharply. Cotton mills in Shanghai were forced to order foreign cotton, which has been shipped to Shanghai in batches since January of this year. Domestic cotton exported to Japan is used for manufacturing ammunition and as textile raw materials. The details are as follows:

Ordering Foreign Cotton to Transport to Shanghai for Supply

Due to the Japanese puppet regime's control over cotton in the occupied areas, the various Chinese cotton mills in Shanghai could not transport it to Shanghai. At the same time, the government banned the transportation of cotton to Shanghai because it is a raw material for ammunition, resulting in a shortage of raw materials for the mills. They had no choice but to order foreign cotton from India and other places. In January and February of this year, imported cotton totaled 167,785 metric tons, valued at 11,800,302 yuan in national currency. India accounted for the most, with 82,714 metric tons, followed by Brazil with 21,271 metric tons, and then Egypt with 18,193 metric tons.

Japanese Puppet Regime Controls Large Quantities to be Transported to Japan

The Japanese puppet regime controlled cotton in its occupied areas and loaded it onto Japanese ships to be transported to Japan to supply textile raw materials and manufacture ammunition. In 1938, the total amount exported to Japan, the Kwantung Leased Territory, Korea, and Taiwan was 1,217,471 metric tons, valued at 89,897,717 yuan in national currency. From January to February of this year, the total was 36,768 metric tons, valued at 2,926,606 yuan in national currency. Japanese merchants have established cotton management agencies in Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Jinan, Shanghai, and other places to control transportation and sales.

### Flags to be Lowered at Half-Mast Tomorrow by All Sectors to Commemorate Huanghuagang Martyrs; The Seventy-Two Martyrs Bravely Sacrificed Their Lives, Their Spirit is Great; All Sectors Determined to Carry on Their Legacy to Complete the National Reconstruction

Tomorrow is the Memorial Day of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang. All sectors of the city have decided to mourn in unison. The entire city will automatically lower flags to half-mast, suspend entertainment, and promote the relief donation movement and the national spiritual mobilization. The details are as follows:

Brief History of the Sacrifice of Revolutionary Martyrs

The Huanghuagang Uprising was a sequel to the uprising of the Guangdong New Army two years before the founding of the Republic of China. The location of the uprising was in Guangzhou, and the general headquarters for planning the uprising was set up in Hong Kong, with the martyr Huang Xing as the commander-in-chief. Xie Liangmu raised tens of thousands of dollars from overseas Chinese in Nanyang as funding. At the time of the uprising, Mr. Huang Xing led more than a hundred comrades to attack the Governor-General's Office. Later, because the Governor-General of Guangdong, Zhang Mingqi, transferred troops to encircle and suppress them, the revolutionaries were ultimately defeated due to numerical inferiority. Afterwards, the Governor-General of Guangdong implemented even more terrifying policies, and party members and civilians with shaved hair were killed. After the event, seventy-two bodies were recovered and buried in Huanghuagang. However, because of the Huanghuagang Uprising, the tide of revolutionary anger among the Chinese people was further aroused, and the belief in the Three People's Principles penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people, finally leading to the Wuchang Uprising on October 10th and the founding of the Republic of China. Therefore, the sacrifice of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang occupies a glorious and great page in the history of the Chinese Revolution.

Flags Lowered, Entertainment Suspended by All Sectors

All sectors of this city believe that the revolutionary martyrs of Huanghuagang bravely sacrificed their lives to complete a great mission, and their spirit will last forever. During this period of the War of Resistance against Japan, when the national crisis is severe, remembering the martyrs inspires infinite admiration and worship. Therefore, all groups, schools, shops, and households in the city have decided to automatically lower flags to half-mast tomorrow and suspend the entertainment industry. The Jianghai Customs, the Post Office, and the courts of the two special districts will all be closed as usual. Schools will also hold memorial ceremonies to express condolences and mourn.

Thrifty Relief, Spiritual Mobilization

It is also learned that the citizens of this city, although living on an isolated island, deeply feel the suffocation of the atmosphere and the harshness of the environment. However, they have spared no effort in advocating and implementing thrift and relief for refugees. The total amount of monthly donations reaches more than 100,000 yuan. Due to the large number of refugees, the economy is still tight, so fundraising work continues to reduce the burden on the government. At the same time, in order to uphold the government's policy of resistance to Japan and inherit the revolutionary legacy of the martyrs to complete the great cause of national reconstruction, all groups in agriculture, industry, commerce, and education have decided to actively promote national spiritual mobilization to concentrate their strength and strive for final victory.

### After Stipulating Methods for Repaying Debts with Customs Duties, Ministry of Finance Strives to Maintain Creditworthiness; Outstanding British and French Debts Still to be Repaid; Central Bank Requests Instructions from Ministry Regarding Gold Standard Payment Method

In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has always fulfilled its debt repayments on schedule. Since announcing the methods for repaying debts with customs duties on January 15th, it has now been decided to handle the matter in the same way due to the interception of salt taxes in various places by the Japanese, and to formulate an appropriate method that conforms to reality in order to maintain creditworthiness. The details are as follows:

Foreign Debts Guaranteed by Salt Tax Revenue

As of June 1937, the foreign debts guaranteed by salt tax revenue included: (1) the 1908 Anglo-French loan of £500,000; (2) the 1912 Crisp Loan of £3,930,837; (3) the 1911 Hukuang Railway Loan of £5,656,000; (4) the Vickers Marconi Loan of £2,403,200; and (5) the 1919 Chicago Bank Loan of $5,500,000. The total was £12,490,037 and $5,500,000.

Government Strives to Maintain Creditworthiness

Although the Ministry of Finance has stipulated methods for repaying various debts guaranteed by customs duties and salt tax revenue, in order to maintain creditworthiness, the debts guaranteed by surplus customs duties that were due at the end of January, as well as the Fuxing Loan due at the end of February and the Jinlong Loan due at the end of March, will still be subsidized by the central government and repaid as usual. As for the Anglo-French loan guaranteed by salt tax revenue that is due on April 15th and the Crisp Loan due at the end of March, they will still be repaid as usual. As for the measures taken for various debts guaranteed by customs duties and salt tax revenue, they were actually due to environmental circumstances. The Ministry is now formulating an appropriate method that conforms to reality to maintain China's creditworthiness.

Gold Standard Payment for Jinlong Loan, Instructions Requested from Chongqing by Telegram

A "New Voices" reporter learned from banking circles yesterday that the eleventh repayment of principal and interest on the financial long-term public debt guaranteed by surplus customs duties, which is scheduled to be paid at the end of March, was drawn by the National Debt Fund Management Committee in Shanghai on March 10th. In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has decided to fully repay it upon maturity. Regarding the payment method, it has not yet been issued. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has already telegraphed the head office to request instructions on the payment method and has decided to start payment on March 31st after receiving the order. It is reported that the principal and interest due for the Jinlong Loan are originally 1,125,000 yuan for the principal and 421,875 yuan for the interest.

Uniform Periodic Lottery for Category C Bonds

The seventh repayment of the principal of the Category C bonds of the 1936 Unification Public Bonds will be drawn in Shanghai on April 10th under the order of the National Debt Fund Management Committee. The date of repayment of principal and interest is July 31st. The payments will be made by the Central Bank and its commissioned Bank of China and Bank of Communications, as well as the Central Trust. The amount of the seventh repayment of principal and interest for various Unified Bonds is: (1) Category A: principal of 3,600,000 yuan, interest of 4,252,500 yuan; (2) Category B: principal of 1,350,000 yuan, interest of 4,365,000 yuan; (3) Category C: principal of 2,800,000 yuan, interest of 10,290,000 yuan; (4) Category D: principal of 4,400,000 yuan, interest of 16,005,000 yuan; (5) Category E: principal of 2,080,000 yuan, interest of 7,566,000 yuan.

### Misfortune of Japanese Banks: Overt Profits, Covert Losses

According to a report in the French "Peiping Political and Economic News," based on the latest statistics released by the Japanese, the total profits of various privately owned Japanese banks, such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi, in 1938 were 5,866,600 Japanese yen. However, it is reported that the total amount of their bad debts reached 8,504,000 Japanese yen. Because of this, all Japanese banks are overtly profitable but covertly losing money, and almost all of their reserve funds have been converted into public bonds.

### Post Office Holiday Notice

Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1534: "It has been determined that the 29th of this month is a regular holiday for this Bureau. The office hours of all sections and branches of this Bureau shall follow the established Sunday schedule. This notice is hereby given for general information.

### Japanese Traffic Regulations Ineffective; Fail to Prevent Accidents; Jewish Car Badly Damaged, Japanese Public Bus Should Be Responsible

The "Shanghai Evening Post" reported that the strict traffic regulations recently implemented by the Japanese authorities in Hongkou and Huishan, as well as other areas under their control, have failed to prevent traffic accidents. Shortly after 2 PM yesterday (the 26th), two public buses collided at the intersection of Broadway Road and Minhang Road. One of the buses was operated by the Japanese, running on a circular route through the main roads of the areas north of the Suzhou Creek. The other bus was carrying Jewish refugees living in the northern district to and from the Waibaidu Bridge. According to witnesses, the Japanese bus was stopped at the station on Broadway Road almost directly opposite Minhang Road, while the Jewish bus was driving down Broadway Road towards the Waibaidu Bridge. Then the Japanese bus started to move, and without paying attention to the Jewish bus, attempted to turn into Minhang Road, colliding with the Jewish bus, causing significant damage to the protective structures and the left side panel. Fortunately, no one was injured. If the two vehicles had not been moving slower, there might have been more serious consequences. There are 3,000 Jewish refugees living in the northern district. Because they often go to the south of the bridge, the committee in charge of their welfare decided some time ago to purchase a bus themselves to save money. It is said that the bus travels several fixed routes every day. It is reported that yesterday's accident is being investigated today by the Public Concession Police Department and the Japanese Consulate's General Affairs Section.

The prosperous central area was completely reduced to ashes. 1,326 houses and shops were destroyed by fire, each housing three to five families,

Nearly a Thousand Deaths

More than a thousand people were injured. There are still corpses being burned and crushed in the fire, impossible to estimate. Property losses amount to 50 million yuan, a truly unprecedented disaster. Now, the essence is exhausted, the vitality is greatly damaged, and the refugees are displaced, about 20,000 to 30,000.

### Commissioned Relief; Group Ancestral Worship; Puan Taoist Temple Held at the Jueyuan in Hart Road

This year's Puan Taoist Temple, because of the current Qingming Festival this spring, realized that it would be very inconvenient for people from all walks of life to go to various places to sweep tombs or worship ancestors at home. Therefore, it is permitted to hold a large-scale group ancestral worship on April 6th (Qingming) at the Buddhist Pure Land Society in the Jueyuan on Hart Road. The ceremony is solemn and grand. High monks chant scriptures day and night and provide vegetarian lunches. A percentage of the proceeds will be donated to help refugees. Those from all walks of life who wish to transcend their ancestors and parents may participate. This can avoid trouble and save money, and the merit is better than everything. The fee for righteous recommendations is only 5 yuan in national currency per lotus seat, and the fee for supplementary recommendations is only 2 yuan. There are no other charges. However, because Qingming is near, those who wish to participate must first register at the Puan Taoist Temple at 422 Hart Road. If it is inconvenient to travel far, call 30738, and a staff member will be sent to contact you. The charter will be sent upon request.

Refugee Egg-Cracking Work

There are still many refugees in the shelters of Shanghai, most of whom come from the countryside or are industrial and commercial people who have lost their jobs due to the war. If the able-bodied do not work, they will easily develop laziness. If relief is stopped, they will not be accustomed to the labor of the past and indulge in pleasure, which will harm society. The International Relief Committee of this city, in view of this, has expanded the original craft group, with Mr. Li Guiyong as the chairman and Mr. Zheng Wenhan as the director of the group, urging the various shelters to carry out various crafts. In addition to expanding the original embroidery, sock weaving, grass rope weaving, sewing, knitting, rattan, and straw mat crafts, recently, in view of the importance of training refugee skills, a radio training class and a soap-making training class have been held. Yesterday, cooperation was obtained from the Yumin Egg Factory to select male and female refugees in the first shelter on Masnan Road for egg-cracking work. It is said that each refugee earns 20 to 30 cents a day.

### Visiting the Refugee Camp Before Departure: French Commander Inspects Refugee Children, Believing China Will Ultimately Triumph – One of the Most Meaningful Days of His Service in China

Colonel Bo Wenjie, commander of the French garrison in Shanghai, has served in China for many years with the French defense forces. He has a deep understanding of the Chinese people and has expressed his sympathy for China's resistance against Japan. During the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle, he led the French garrison in rescuing Chinese refugees with all his strength, for which he was deeply grateful by the Chinese government and people. Recently, as Colonel Bo's term of office neared its end and his return home approached, he made a special visit to express his concern for Chinese refugees. A few days ago, he went by a command vehicle to the International Relief Committee's First Refugee Camp on Route Massenet to observe the living conditions of the refugees. He was warmly received by Mrs. Pan Dayu, the director of the camp, and Father Mumu. Six hundred refugee children stood in two neat rows on both sides of the main road inside the camp, standing at attention and saluting with spirited bravery. Colonel Bo was deeply moved. He patted the refugee children and said, "Good chests, you will all be good soldiers!" He then handed his movie camera to Director Pan and, acting as the reviewing officer, inspected the refugee children, asking Director Pan to take photos of him as a memento. Afterwards, Director Pan led him on a tour of the entire camp. He highly praised the dedication of the camp staff and expressed to the refugees his absolute belief that China would ultimately be victorious. He bid farewell at a little after eleven o'clock. Upon leaving, he said to Director Pan, "This is the most meaningful day of my service in China!" He then sealed a check in an envelope and handed it to Mrs. Yu Gidan, asking her to purchase supplies to reward the refugee children on Easter.

### More Jade and Precious Stones Shipped to the United States for Exhibition – A Total of 7,200 Pieces Valued at Two Million Yuan

The first and second batches of exhibits from Shanghai manufacturers for the U.S. World's Fair were shipped in January. The remaining jade and precious stones, etc., that could not be packed in time, after the efforts of the Shanghai Managers' Association and Mr. Lu Shou Lian, were shipped to the United States on the Changxing Company's Empress of Japan on the 19th of this month. A reporter from the New Voice News met with Mr. Lu at the International Hotel yesterday, who gave the following details:

Jade and Precious Stones Valued at Two Million

This third batch of jade and precious stones shipped to the United States for exhibition consists of 20 boxes, with more than 300 styles, totaling 7,200 pieces, including jade incense burners, crystals, jade artifacts, etc., valued at more than two million yuan.

Jade Manufacturer Sends Personnel to Oversee

Among them is a pair of antique jade palace lanterns, valued at more than 150,000 yuan. There is also a small jade pendant two inches high that can be worn on the chest, valued at US$15,000. All of the above jade and precious stones were handled by three major Shanghai companies: Gu Xianji, Jin Changhou, and Cui Huaxuan. The companies also sent four people, including Zhang Zitian, at their own expense to oversee everything.

Admission Tickets Collected for Viewing

The manufacturers participating in the U.S. World's Fair, along with the countries along the Pacific Ocean, are attending under the name of their countries. Only China, due to the wartime situation, is attending under the name of manufacturers. Therefore, there are some funding problems. Chinese merchants in the Americas must collect an additional 25 cents for entrance to "China Village" to help with expenses, but it was recently reduced to 10 cents to make it more accessible.

Tiantu MSG Sets Up Separate Exhibition

The owner of Tiantu MSG Factory took the Clipper to the United States specifically to exhibit the MSG business.

The sample rooms in the food section feature famous foods from various countries, but China has not yet participated.

Chinese Native Products Sold Out

After being designed and improved by the Shanghai Managers' Association, native products such as figurines and landscapes have also been shipped to the United States. It is said that Americans are very fond of Chinese art. Chinese landscape figurines have been sold out. This is due to the appropriate design of the Shanghai Managers' Association, which gave Americans a very good impression. In the future, if Chinese domestic products can sell well in the United States, the Shanghai Managers' Association will have played a significant role. It is said that the scale of the U.S. World's Fair is much larger than the past Chicago World's Fair. The Chinese domestic products shipped to the United States by Chinese manufacturers are guaranteed by the Shanghai Customs, with reduced export taxes. All jade and precious stones will be displayed in the "Emerald Heaven" room inside the pagoda of "China Village."

After verifying the statements in court, the judge ordered a postponement of the trial to April 3rd. The defendant was remanded in custody.

### Opium Public Sales in Western Shanghai: Internal Strife Erupts; 50,000 Yuan in "Entertainment Expenses" End Up in the Pockets of the Handlers

The public sale of opium in western Shanghai was very profitable for the "soil firms." Initially, there were only five firms, as an experiment. Seeing the business flourish, the number of firms continued to increase to as many as fifteen. According to reliable sources, the estimated total profit each month reached a huge sum of over 200,000 yuan. Recently, due to increased attention from the concession authorities, for safety, the owners of the "soil firms" decided to allocate 50,000 yuan each month from their surplus as "entertainment expenses." These funds were entrusted to Lan Jizhi, the owner of Yu Chang "soil firm" and the most active in promoting the public sale of opium in western Shanghai, and a man named Zheng Fuying for management and distribution. Unexpectedly, Lan and Zheng, driven by insatiable greed, pocketed most of the 50,000 yuan in "entertainment expenses," causing internal disputes within the Shanghai Western "Soil Firm" Association. However, according to those familiar with the details, the allocation of 50,000 yuan each month by each "soil firm" as "entertainment expenses" was indeed true. Ostensibly, the funds were managed and distributed by a Zhu Shunlin on behalf of Zheng and Lan, but in reality, the entire amount was embezzled by Zheng, Lan, and Zhu. Therefore, there have been intense undercurrents within the Shanghai Western "Soil Firm" Association recently.

### Another Accomplice Apprehended in the Plot to Kidnap Sheng Yupeng

Sheng Zecheng (also known as Lao Si), a descendant of Sheng Xingsun, a former Qing Dynasty Grand Guardian of the Heir Apparent, lived at No. 75 Yuyuan Road. His nine-year-old son, Yupeng, attended the Western District School of the Municipal Council at No. 48 Avenue du Parc. At 3:15 PM on the 20th of this month, Chen Jin'du, the son of Chen Fu, an old servant of the Sheng family, suddenly conceived an evil plan. He hired accomplices and rented a car, driving to the school with the intention of luring Yupeng out and kidnapping him for ransom. The plot was thwarted when Detective Wu Chengmo of the Jing'an Temple Police Station arrested Chen Jin'du and his accomplice, Zhang Zhixiong, and sent them to the First Special District Court for trial and detention. Yesterday, the Chinese and foreign detectives in charge of this case apprehended another accomplice, Zhang Jinqing, a native of Jiangbei, at No. 12 Miaolong Lane on Jing'an Temple Road. He was taken to the police station and then sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case and requested permission to detain him for joint trial. After a brief interrogation by Judge Xiao, he ordered him to be remanded in custody pending a joint trial with Chen Jin'du on April 3rd.

### Divorce Suit Rejected

Chen Shiru, a native of Shaoxing and an employee of the China National Products Company on Nanjing Road, residing at No. 300 Qipu Road, married a woman from the same hometown, Tong Qiaoxian. They had several children. In recent years, Tong became influenced by modern trends, and her clothing and lifestyle became extravagant. As a result, the 20 yuan monthly allowance Chen provided was insufficient for her expenses. She became dissatisfied with her husband and often ridiculed him, causing their love to deteriorate and leading to frequent arguments and fights. Recently, Tong hired lawyer Zhang Fukang to file a suit for separation of three years against her husband, Chen Shiru, in the District Court of the First Special District, requesting a court order for the defendant to continue paying a monthly allowance of 20 yuan during the separation period. However, Chen hired lawyer Yan Hongxiang to file a counterclaim against Tong Qiaoxian, requesting a court order for her to cohabitate with him. He argued that her sudden lawsuit was instigated by someone behind the scenes and requested that the original suit be rejected to prevent the couple from divorcing. Judge Peng summoned both parties for questioning and rendered a judgment yesterday. The main points of the judgment were that the plaintiff's suit was rejected and the plaintiff, Tong Qiaoxian, should cohabitate with the defendant, Chen Shiru. However, Tong had already moved elsewhere.

### Teenager Run Over and Killed by Tram

At 3:45 AM yesterday, Tram No. 152 of the French Tramway Company, Route 18, traveling between the North Railway Station and the Xieqiao area, was driven by driver Tang Jingmei (No. 13). As it was traveling south in front of the Slaughterhouse Company on Avenue Doumer in the French Concession, Guan Zairong, a 16-year-old local resident of Huacheng Road, suddenly crossed the road westward from the pedestrian crossing at the entrance of the Xin Wanxiang Sauce Shop on Huacheng Road. Driver Tang inadvertently knocked Guan down, and the wheels ran over his lower body and legs, causing severe injuries to his hips, legs, and abdomen. He was immediately taken to Guangci Hospital but died before treatment could be administered.

Jihua Pharmacy, a leading new pharmaceutical enterprise in Shanghai, was founded on Yunnan Road, north of the Xixin Bridge, and has been in operation for over thirty years.

### Love is the Foundation of Marriage

Deep love between couples makes a good family;

A husband's weakness casts a shadow on a sunny day!

The family is people's home and the foundation of society. The backbone of the family is the couple, which everyone knows. But what is the foundation of a couple? Probably not a few people are ignorant of this. Because in society, there are marriages bought and sold under the magic of money, as well as combinations of men and women dominated by feudal forces, relying solely on the words of matchmakers and the orders of parents, or even betrothals in the womb, and strange shapes such as red faces and white hair are not uncommon. In addition, ordinary stupid men and women, either blinded by vanity or confused by appearances, hastily consummate their good deeds, thus ruining their life's happiness, which is also very common. Men and women live together without love, which is called sleeping in the same bed with different dreams, and only wastes their youth. Isn't it very sad?

Then what is the foundation of a couple? Undoubtedly it is love. A loving couple, not only when they spend time together day and night, their hearts are connected, their pulses are connected, giving birth to clever children, organizing a happy family, how happy is their life! Even if they are separated, thousands of miles away, their love is still entangled, their dreams are intertwined, and they have a great sense of being unable to separate! Why is their love so deep? In our medical research, it is nothing more than the development of the unique physical characteristics of women, which have a strong aesthetic power to attract men; and the strength of men's energy, which can meet the needs of women. In addition, of course, aspects such as men and women's thoughts, morals, and personality are also related, but they are not the main thing. Because of this reason, women are particularly particular about beauty, and after marriage, men must pay special attention to maintaining their energy. If they can truly be healthy men and beautiful women, they will surely have a love as deep as the sea and be happier than flying. If a man has committed masturbation and nocturnal emission in his early years, or has been promiscuous after marriage, or has been injured by other worries, resulting in spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, neurasthenia, thin sperm and infertility, then the married life cannot be complete, and love will be shattered without a trace. If it is not treated quickly, it will lead to a tragedy of the couple turning against each other and the family! Regarding the method of treatment, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the most effective treatment is to take the reproductive gland preparation "Reproductive Hormone", because this agent can produce sperm and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood, and nourish nerves within one day and night after taking it. If you can continue to take it, you will be able to completely cure the above-mentioned symptoms in a short period of time, and you can also achieve the effect of prolonging life and rejuvenating yourself. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Hymito's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gates and control this leakage, so the effect is even faster.

### The Misery of Shrunken Breasts!

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Since the wave of women needing health and beauty has spread to various cities, I think all women who are ugly with shrunken breasts should be aware of it! Because a woman's lifelong happiness can be said to be completely controlled by a pair of breasts. If the breasts are shrunken and beauty is lost, then no matter how good her environment is, she cannot escape the slaughter of the devil. Let me give an example of a recent inquiry: "...To say my environment, there are many servants at home, I have a car to go in and out, I pay attention to clothing, and the enjoyment is excellent, which can be said to be the extreme of human wealth, but because I have been sick and in pain since I was a child, now I have irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, abdominal pain, and brain swelling, which makes my body uncomfortable every day. What I regret most is that due to the constant invasion of diseases, I have become haggard, my buttocks are thin, and my breasts are especially shrunken and pitiful. No matter how I dress up, when I go out, people see me, I don't know why, they always whisper about me. A quick-tongued relative even called me [old gun widow] behind my back. When I heard this title, I was really angry and dizzy, but what's the use of being dizzy? Alas!...I am twenty-five years old this year, but I don't have a partner yet, and my youth is wasted, can I not..." In the environment of Miss ×, her experience is like this, and the miserable fate of others whose environment is not as good as her can be imagined. However, in this day and age, science is omnipotent, and this kind of defect is also very easy to make up for. The main reason for shrunken breasts and aging is entirely due to the dysfunction of the ovaries, which affects metabolism. If you take the right medicine at this time, the ovarian preparation "Female Reproductive Hormone", it is not difficult to eliminate various gynecological diseases in a short period of time, make the body healthier day by day, and then the breasts will naturally be tall and the complexion will naturally be smooth. If you continue to take it, you can also prevent disease and prolong life and maintain youth.

### Spermatorrhea is Like Digging Your Own Grave

— Sexually Transmitted Diseases Specialist Doctor Zhan Nianceng

Perhaps our shouts are too weak, but we have exhausted our voices. We are very uneasy seeing large numbers of young people running into the grave. This is indeed the misfortune of the times, but it is also our responsibility. We beat our chests and ask ourselves, feeling deeply guilty! However, young people of the times, you must also take care of yourselves. If you are not aware of it at all, then the efforts of others are in vain. Young people should be aware of the importance of their own responsibilities, especially in this great era, almost everything is waiting for you to rise up. But to shoulder this responsibility and prepare for the future struggle, you must have a strong physique and a smart brain. We know that there are not a few young people who are conscientious and hardworking to serve the country. But most are addicted to alcohol, or cause damage to their sexual function due to masturbation or early indulgence during the period of spring passion. Lack of sperm control, followed by nocturnal emission. Or, more frequently, nocturnal emission can cause spermatorrhea, kidney deficiency, incomplete development, neurasthenia and other symptoms. Then they are trapped in weakness and pain all day long. Not only can they not bear the heavy burden of the times, but they can not even perform the marital life of passing on the family, and they are hated by their wives, leading to all kinds of tragedies in the family. Therefore, if this disease is not removed, it is like being in a tomb. Although you are breathing, what is the meaning of being alive?

Regarding the effective treatment of nocturnal emission, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, we all believe that we must purify the heart and reduce desires, abstain from masturbation, and take "Hymito's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gates and calm the mind, and nocturnal emission can be cured. If the above-mentioned symptoms have been caused by nocturnal emission, you must also take the reproductive gland preparation "Reproductive Hormone" to nourish essence and blood, strengthen the brain and kidneys. If you can continue to take it, you will be able to recover soon, and you can also achieve the effect of prolonging life.

### Gonorrhea Destroys Reproductive Tissues

Gonorrhea is very fast in reproduction and very destructive, so people who suffer from gonorrhea are burdened by it for life. And the place where it destroys is always inseparable from the reproductive organ tissue. Like prostate inflammation, seminal vesiculitis, vasitis, orchitis, etc., all have the terrible possibility of destroying reproductive function. Therefore, infertility due to gonorrhea is 80-90%, which is something that every leucorrhea patient must pay attention to. It is advisable to carefully detect the symptoms and confirm that they belong to gonorrhea. Therefore, the medical equipment for diagnosis must be complete. Such as urethroscope, cystoscope, high-power microscope, slide glass, etc., are all indispensable. A clear diagnosis is like reconnaissance of the enemy's strength and location in war. With such information, you can win by surprise and capture the enemy. Treatment of Lin disease is also the same. First use scientific methods to diagnose the location of the disease, and then use scientific methods to completely cure it. Therefore, even stubborn and difficult to treat leucorrhea is not to be feared. All kinds of leucorrhea that can destroy reproduction can be treated with German Hershey's serum. Its bactericidal power penetrates deep into the tissues and can enhance the ability to resist gonorrhea. Its effectiveness is superior to all serums and pigment injections. It can replace all surgery. And on the one hand, use the latest invented filter-level electrotherapy by Dr. Genna, a German pharmacist, to insert the catheter into the urethra, so even strong gonococci will find it difficult to resist this type of projected electricity, so it can especially exert the bactericidal effect of Hershey's serum. It can also filter out the toxins produced by gonococci, so filter electrotherapy is the most advanced electrotherapy and is unparalleled in the world. It has been adopted by major venereal disease hospitals in the West. Various gonorrhea that destroy reproductive tissues can be cured in a short period of time and guaranteed to restore reproductive ability.

Departments Also treat syphilis, inguinal bubo, chancre, and painless new method of circumcision.

### Letter

To whom it may concern, according to the statement from the party concerned, Wenlan Joint Rental Agency, in the news column of your newspaper, there was a report of a rental dispute between the landlord and tenants of Wenlan Fang on Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession, which is inconsistent with the facts. We request a correction. After checking, before the transfer of property rights of the Wenlan Fang houses, each building originally rented for seventy yuan. After the property rights were transferred to our agency in November of the 26th year, the rent was only thirty-five to forty-two yuan. At the same time, all tenants were notified to come to sign contracts. The house tickets and contracts all clearly stated that water and electricity costs were to be borne by the tenants themselves. At that time, the water and electricity company did not have this type of water meter, so it was delayed until February of this year that the installation was completed. However, a small number of tenants have been making trouble, refusing to pay rent, speaking disrespectfully to collectors, and ignoring repeated demands for contract signing. Their intentions are self-evident. Furthermore, the Wenlan Fang managed by our agency consists of a total of thirty-three buildings, while your newspaper reported more than twenty, which is also inaccurate. Therefore, we specially request your great lawyer to send a letter requesting a correction, and hope you will handle it accordingly. Sincerely, To the News Editors of Shen Bao, Lawyer Lu Shidao, March 27th.

Commentary

### Encouraging the New Pharmaceutical Industry and Addressing the Physicians' Association

— Liu Yixiang

I have always loved using domestically produced new drugs. Initially, I was worried about the impurity of the quality and felt uneasy when using them. However, after careful inspection and selection, the results were satisfactory, which I found comforting. However, recently, the number of pharmaceutical factories has increased, and the types of new drugs have also increased. When Factory A releases a new drug, Factories B and C are sure to follow suit, even resorting to cutting corners and reducing materials to compete with each other, which greatly disappoints users. Looking at the rubber industry before January 28th, because a certain factory made a significant profit, everyone rushed to catch up, manufacturing crudely and recklessly, and selling at low prices. As a result, no profit was made, or they went bankrupt or closed down, resulting in a lose-lose situation. This is what is called a suicidal policy. The path taken by the new pharmaceutical industry is quite similar to this. With the lessons of the past, I cannot help but feel concerned. Pharmaceutical factories in Europe and the United States all produce products of uniform quality and constantly improve them. However, pharmaceutical factories in our country only greedily seek immediate small profits, reducing the quality when sales are good. I hope that the new pharmaceutical industry will have a long-term vision, taking revitalizing national products as its responsibility, striving for excellence, and not lowering quality due to competition. For example, the competition for yeast preparations is the most intense. Although the price has decreased, the quality is far from what it used to be. What the medical community hopes for are excellent products that can replace foreign goods, not cheaply made products. Each factory should have a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation and should not compete by reducing quality. Minor quality differences are fine for two or three nutritional supplements, but if all medical injectable drugs are handled in this way, the future of the new pharmaceutical industry will be very bleak. As a result, those who love national products will have to turn to high-priced foreign goods. The Swiss Ciba Pharmaceutical Factory and Roche Pharmaceutical Factory do not produce many products, but each one is of excellent quality. I believe that the new pharmaceutical industry in our country should take them as a model, not producing crudely and recklessly. It is most fortunate.

Finally, I have a suggestion for the Physicians' Association. The Physicians' Association, occupying a leading position, should unite with the health bureaus of the two concessions to register new drugs. Those that meet the standards should be issued certificates, and those that are found to be of poor quality or do not meet the standards after registration should be punished. In this way, unscrupulous operators will be deterred, and legitimate operators will be protected. Doctors can use qualified drugs with peace of mind, achieving multiple benefits in one fell swoop. I hope that the officials of the authorities will work hard to achieve this.

### Regarding Public Bathhouses

— Jiang Shao Song

Bathing is the first step in cleanliness and hygiene, which everyone knows and does not need explanation. However, aside from schools with perfect facilities, and noble organizations and institutions with their own bathrooms, people in the metropolis can also go to hotels that have rooms with bathrooms to bathe. The bathing problem for other people can only be completely entrusted to public bathhouses - commonly known as "mixed baths". This is a place exclusively for men to bathe. Women can only wait for the arrival of the God of Summer to make things easier. The heavy cost of running into a public bathhouse, the common use of bath towels, and the dirtiness of the large pool - these fundamental improvement problems of the bathhouse will not be discussed at the moment. Let us first discuss two problems. These two problems are the special scenery of the public bathhouse, namely "back scrubbing" and "foot massage". I must state that I am not criticizing the value of the profession, but rather contributing some opinions from a hygienic point of view for the reference of bathers. Every public

The Problem of Back Scrubbing

Every public bathhouse is prepared with a large batch of naked back scrubbing staff for the bathers to use. If the bathers do not want back scrubbing, they are very unwelcome, and the service in the bathhouse seems very indifferent. So most of the bathers who step into the public bathhouse receive back scrubbing. Some fat old patrons even specify one or two experts to give a heavy full-body massage. Light scrubbing is not satisfying. Some old bathers bathe every day and scrub every day. Without bathing and scrubbing, they feel itchy and unbearable. Some even use boiling hot bath water, scrubbing as they pour the water on themselves. These are habits formed along with the public bathhouse. From a medical and hygienic point of view, there are quite a few flaws. Why? During back scrubbing, the skin temporarily becomes congested. In other words, most of the blood in the body rushes to the skin. Therefore, staying in the bathroom for too long easily causes fainting, such as acute cerebral anemia and other acute diseases. The face turns pale, and the person becomes unconscious, causing panic and confusion. This kind of news is often heard. Skin congestion causes internal organ anemia because the amount of blood in the human body is limited and will not increase due to bathing. If you follow the saying "do not get a haircut on an empty stomach, and do not bathe on a full stomach," it is even more unreasonable because internal organ anemia also leads to digestive organ anemia. Digestive power will definitely decrease, so going to bathe and scrub after a full meal is very likely to cause digestive disorders and is very inappropriate. If you bathe and scrub every day, spending a long time in the bathroom, the chance of catching a cold increases in the winter. Daily washing and scrubbing with boiling hot bath water often anesthetizes the superficial nerves of the skin, and the skin's nutrition will deteriorate, and its resistance will decrease. The skin becomes loose and easily infected with skin diseases or eczema. It is easy for us to see that many people who often bathe and scrub suffer from skin diseases, probably due to the habit of scrubbing. There must be some causal relationship. There is also one thing that needs to be added as a warning. Many people who initially suffer from scabies always run to the bathhouse to scrub their backs. Although scrubbing can temporarily relieve itching, the skin becomes congested and its resistance weakens. Boiling hot bath water cannot kill the mites, but the spread of scabies becomes faster and more extensive the next day. This is a definite course. I am not saying that people with scabies should not bathe. Bathing is indeed excellent, but do not scrub your back because the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.

The Problem of Foot Massage

Many people leave school life and enter society to work. After going to public bathhouses to bathe, they gradually develop the habit of foot massage. The person being massaged feels both pain and itch, with an indescribable feeling of pleasure. Initially, there is a situation of half-acceptance and half-rejection, both happy and afraid. After deciding and trying it a few times, it becomes like a smoking addiction, impossible to stop. Some with long-term addiction even choose skilled masseuses for heavy massage, not stopping until the skin breaks and water flows out. However, the foot massage cloths used in the bathhouse are always the same ones. Many of those old bathers and old friends who massage feet often suffer from chronic eczema or athlete's foot (Hong Kong foot). While massaging left and right, again and again, all the bathers become infected with foot dampness or athlete's foot. The author has several close friends who have personally experienced this situation. Some even had large areas of skin broken by the foot massage, resulting in prolonged pus and blood that took a long time to heal. Several people decided to never massage their feet again. As a result, their old foot dampness and athlete's foot completely healed. These are all very true facts. There is also an unrealistic saying circulating in society that if foot dampness is cured, the damp heat will attack internally and turn into internal diseases. Do not believe this. Foot dampness is indeed difficult to treat in people who continue to massage their feet. The popular saying that it turns into internal diseases after being cured may be a way for doctors to shirk responsibility. When internal diseases subside, various skin eczema and so on on the body can indeed be alleviated somewhat. This is because during internal diseases, the skin is malnourished, and the bacteria parasitic in the skin layer wither and die, and skin secretions are also greatly reduced. Therefore, the habit of foot massage can be said to be entirely without merit. The feet are originally prone to eczema. We cannot guarantee that people who do not massage their feet will never suffer from eczema, but foot massage is indeed the best way to push the boat along and help spread the infection. Regardless of the bathhouse managers being annoyed and unable to please the bathers, I urge all bathers to make up their minds and quickly quit the habit of foot massage. This habit is harmful and useless.

### The Scientification of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Continued from Issue 6)

— Zhou Mengbai

(Antipyretics II) Scutellaria baicalinsis, Georg.

Morphology

This product is collected from the roots of Scutellaria baicalinsis and dried between November and February of the following year. The plant is a perennial herb of the Lamiaceae family, produced in the northern provinces of our country. The underground roots are deep yellow and hard. The stems are about one meter tall, the leaves are opposite, without stalks, lanceolate, with sharp ends. Spiked inflorescences emerge from the leaf axils, with pale purple labiate flowers blooming in summer, after which small spherical achenes are formed.

Taste and Contraindications

The taste is slightly bitter, so its nature is bitter and neutral. It is contraindicated with cinnabar, peony bark, and Veratrum nigrum.

Quality

Dark brown and solid is the best quality, called Tiao Ling. Old roots and those that are hollow in the middle are inferior, called Ku Ling. Currently, those produced in Shanxi and Rehe are considered the best. Those produced in Korea and Japan are of lower quality.

Ingredients

Contains yellow needle-shaped or plate-shaped crystals of Scutellarin. According to recent reports, its roots contain two derivatives: Woogonin C16 H12 05 and Baicalin C21 H18 O11.

Effect

It is an antipyretic and tonic drug, effective in treating influenza, tetanus, vomiting, and diarrhea. Daily dose: 3 to 10 grams, used as a decoction. The ancient prescription Huang Qin Tang is made with Scutellaria baicalinsis 9 grams, jujube 9 grams, licorice 6 grams, peony 6 grams, and water 600 grams, decocted to 200 grams, and taken in three divided doses daily, suitable for feverish diarrhea, large intestine catarrh, and bacillary dysentery.

Old Saying

Ling, said Wen, is written as Quan, referring to its yellow color. Ling also means Qian, which is a yellow-black color, hence the name Huang Ling. Chen Xiuyuan commented on Huang Ling: "Huang Qin, Huang Lian, and Huang Bo all have a bitter taste and yellow color, and their main treatments are roughly similar. Generally speaking, stagnation can treat heat, bitterness can dry dampness, and yellow belongs to earth. Yellow and bright belongs to metal. Metal borrows the color of earth to become its color, so gold is the most valuable of the five metals." In ancient times, there was no scientific theory to discuss medicine. It was so difficult. Why do those who talk about medicine today still like to follow the ancients? Are they lacking scientific knowledge, or are they intentionally respecting the old?

### Talking about Rheumatic Pain

— Wang Yu Gang

The name rheumatic pain is a common term in the old customs. What is its meaning? From the name, it indicates due to wind and dampness. However, the two factors of wind and dampness are mostly inducing factors. Its pathogens are probably elsewhere. According to the symptoms of this disease, when looking for it in the categories of new medicine, I feel that it is most similar to the disease Rheumatismus, so I have translated it as rheumatic pain. However, what new medicine calls neuralgia can also be considered rheumatic pain by the old customs. Syphilitic myositis, arthritis, periostitis, etc. can also be mistaken for rheumatic pain. Conversely, true rheumatic pain can also be mistaken for syphilis. This kind of mistake is also due to the old customs not recognizing the value of diagnostics. The pathogens of rheumatic pain, after many efforts by many researchers, have indeed not been discovered to this day. However, most people explore from the aspect of infectious diseases. The scientific journey is originally an arduous task. There are many patients with rheumatic pain. There are more people in the South of our country than in the North. This is probably because the humidity in the air in the South is higher. The body parts it invades are divided into muscles and joints. Its symptoms are divided into acute and chronic. The acute symptoms of muscle rheumatic pain are pain and swelling of the larger muscles, such as the trapezius muscle in the back, the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the neck, the deltoid muscle in the shoulder, the pectoral muscle, the intercostal muscle, the lumbar muscle, etc., either invading one muscle or invading several muscles at the same time. The pain is severe, and high fever often occurs. If there is no heart disease, the prognosis is generally good. Chronic patients have no fever, the pain is also mild, with a sour nature, occurring and stopping from time to time, and it is not easy to completely cure. The acute symptoms of joint rheumatic pain are the same as the former, but the invasion is in the joints, either one or several, often accompanied by the danger of endocarditis or pleurisy. Chronic patients are mostly limited to one joint, occurring and stopping from time to time, hindering movement. The treatment of this disease, although acute is dangerous, is easy to be effective. The method must be a combination of internal medicine, external application, and injection. In internal medicine, of course, salicylic acid is the main component, supplemented by cardiac stimulants. If the fever is too high, antipyretics are added. External medicine focuses on relieving pain and reducing inflammation, such as cold compresses, applying ichthammol, scopolamine ointment, etc. Among the injectable drugs, intravenous injection of Atophanyl has the fastest effect, but attention must be paid to whether the patient's heart is healthy. For chronic patients, internal medicine is salicylic acid and iodide, and external application is hot water baths and warm poultices, or artificial sun lamps, but the effect is slow. As for the injectable drugs, the current understanding is that Fangji preparations are effective. I have used them repeatedly but have not been satisfied. In short, the pathogens of this disease have not yet been discovered, so it is reasonable that the treatment is difficult to be effective.

Food and Nutrition Knowledge

### Scientific Research on Food and Nutrition

— Zhou Zhenyu

Introduction

When hungry, seek food; when thirsty, seek drink. Therefore, eating and drinking are the basis of life. Only knowing how to seek food and drink without knowing the effects of eating and drinking will gradually damage health in the small way and can cause disease in the large way. How can the way of food and nutrition be neglected?

Checking our country's medical books, there are also the Food Scripture of the King of Huainan, the Food Therapy Materia Medica of Meng Shen, and the Ancient and Modern Food Treatment of Sun Simiao. The ancients' emphasis on the way of food and nutrition can be seen in these. However, in the 20th century, science has progressed with each passing day, and there have also been new developments in the knowledge of food and nutrition. Therefore, the author takes the knowledge of food and nutrition as the warp and the results of scientific research as the weft, willing to ask the gentlemen of the world for their quality.

(1) The Importance of Food and Nutrition

The success of one's career is based on having a healthy body. With a sound body, one can have a sound spirit. With a sound spirit, one's career will be successful in everything. To maintain a healthy body, appropriate food and nutrition are essential.

The new knowledge of food and nutrition is indeed the main discovery of modern science. The remarkable characteristics of this knowledge are that it is accessible to common sense and can be implemented by everyone. If you follow its path, the happiness and joy of a lifetime will be endless. (To be continued)

### Supporting the "Anti-Spitting Campaign"

— Mao Lie

It seems that some people say that at a time when the whole country is busy resisting the war, some things that are not directly related to the war can be reduced, and the strength to do these things can be transferred to special use for the war. Therefore, the "Anti-Spitting Campaign" is regarded by some people as one of these things, thinking that the Shanghai Women's Association, which initiated this campaign, can put this matter aside and do something more urgently needed.

This statement is certainly correct. However, I think that there is nothing wrong with launching this campaign at this time. Resistance to the war is the top priority, that's right; but it is only the top priority, it does not mean that in addition to resistance to the war, nothing else, especially public welfare matters, should be done. Therefore, as long as any organization launches any legitimate campaign, under the condition of not forgetting resistance to the war as the top priority, dividing labor and cooperating, or doing what they can with the remaining strength, who can say that it is not right? Moreover, this campaign is indeed closely related to the health of the nation, and we should pay attention to it at any time and any place. Only a healthy nation can undertake the progress of world civilization; and only a healthy nation can better achieve the success of resisting foreign insults. If we want to be healthy, we have no choice but to resist spitting!

It seems that some people also say that launching this campaign in Shanghai is somewhat like doing it for the Europeans and Americans to see, in order to maintain our dignity. If this is really the case, it is considered unnecessary to make this extra effort. I also think that this statement has considerable reason, because we have our own habits, such as they shake hands when they meet, and we clasp hands, why must we accommodate them and learn their ways to get a compliment from them? However, what is spitting, this bad habit, all about? I think that not spitting, at least not spitting randomly, is something that every modern person should be able to do, regardless of whether Europeans and Americans see it or not! Just as Europeans and Americans like competitive sports, we should also promote competitive sports, and we cannot say that we are learning the fashion.

In addition, I think that launching this campaign in Shanghai or any large city is more urgent than in small cities or villages in the inland. Because in places with many people, tubercle bacilli can be even more rampant. I hope that as far as our current situation is concerned, now that this campaign has been launched in Shanghai, the residents of our Shanghai will all rise up to support and implement it.

To be honest, in every place we go, the sound of coughing and spitting is endless, and with every step we take, phlegm and spittle are constantly in our sight. What kind of phenomenon is this after all! As an individual, I truly hate and detest it! Why should we let it go and not eradicate it completely!

### Morning Exercise

— Zhang Zhenshan

——A Fragment of a Strong Man's Life

The dawn sliced through the darkness of the night. The wilderness gradually changed its colors; the leaves and wild grass all exuded the gentle breath of the morning; the rolling clouds, as they rose with the morning sun, competed in a display of beautiful and magnificent colors—some golden yellow, some cyan and purple, some milky white.

The bugle call, carried by the morning breeze, spread out, even more solemn and clear in the silent sky! Every strong man was stirred with burgeoning ambition.

We braved the misty morning air, ran into the drill ground, and rushed towards the fluttering flag of our company. As a group, we ran, our feet making a "stab-sh, stab-sh" sound. The cinder road stirred up black dust, spreading and covering the nearby grass with a layer of black powder.

"Whistle-whistle—whistle—" suddenly another whistle blast signaled assembly.

Standing under the company flag, we formed a long line: attention, alignment…following the instructor's strong voice, we began to move. Circular movements, once, twice, three times…then, more fiercely, more tensely, running, sprinting, lying down, charging; then breaking down into smaller units, and reassembling.

After these exercises, we began to divide into two opposing groups, practicing positional warfare, setting up guerrilla networks, disrupting the enemy's rear, and assisting the regular army in counterattacks. The use of intelligence and strength seemed like a real battle situation!

Although we were all sweating, our heads like steaming baskets, hot air rising, sweat dripping from our heads to our cheeks, soaking our collars, no one noticed.

During the break, the instructor relaxed his sternness and said to us very kindly:

"Among you, there are quite a few pampered young masters, but your discipline and performance are almost equal to that of a regular army; however, we cannot be complacent, because we are the reserve force for the current stage of the War of Resistance, and we have the responsibility to revitalize the nation and create a new China! Be more courageous, more determined, and strive towards the goal of national liberation!…"

When he finished speaking, a kind smile appeared on his face: then, he ordered us to sing and dismissed the company.

The excited group became even more excited; raising our strong voices, we sang loudly: "For the freedom of national survival, we will not hesitate to use our hot blood, we will not hesitate to use our skulls, to fight against the invaders!…"

At this time, the company, with songs, solemnly walked out of the drill ground, each person seeing clearly the beautiful wilderness bathed in the morning sun; on our hearts, the desire to expel the enemy was further strengthened.

### Thoughts on Reading Books and Newspapers (Continued)

— Tu Lao

A certain newspaper reported: a certain artist went to a certain place to "serve." But it is unknown what "service" he "serves"? Judging from the circumstances, it is probably nothing more than painting and calligraphy.

However, I thought of Zhao Mengfu.

It is said that when Zhao Mengfu painted horses, he first had to lie on the ground and make a horse posture himself, and then start writing. Although this legend ostensibly compliments Zhao Mengfu's realistic skills, in reality, I think it is secretly scolding Zhao Mengfu. If I were to interpret Zhao Mengfu's horse paintings, it would precisely be the material given by the reality of the northern foreign (Jin and Yuan) invasion of China at that time. The horses of the border were the best tools for war at that time, and Chinese historians had long been grateful for them. Whether Zhao Mengfu's horse paintings were due to admiration, awe, or surprise is now impossible to investigate. But after he "loyally protected the Yuan Dynasty," it is entirely possible that he would paint several "portraits" of the horses raised by the "Yuan" generals. At this time, the artist had become a flatterer. So I think that legend is actually a satire.

But now it is a bit difficult for artists to flatter invaders. Cars, tanks, and airplanes can naturally be painted, but even if they are exactly alike, they have no vitality. Only painting cannons is more interesting, but they must be painted as cannons that are currently shelling people. However, painters cannot bring their pens to the battlefield to paint. Learning from Zhao Mengfu, let a cannon shell you first, but you will inevitably lose your life. -- This is really impossible to think of.

However, I suddenly remembered the fate of the painter depicted in Ryunosuke Akutagawa's novel "Hell Screen"... Ah, let's not continue.

I like to read advertisements, but only to understand some new social tricks. Current advertisements are really much more exciting than before.

"To cope with the national crisis, you need a lively body." is an advertisement for a dance hall. "To make it easier for guests to care for refugees, the price of dishes has been greatly sacrificed." is an advertisement for a restaurant. "To fight the war of resistance, the first thing you need is a strong body, and wine can generate blood and nourish the mind." is an advertisement for a hotel...

However, the most brilliant is: "In times of national crisis, you must seek health", and to be "healthy" you must take medicine, and the effect of taking medicine is to "definitely satisfy your wife".

We have been advocating "humor" for several years, and now we really have "humor". But unfortunately, the "humorists" are not paying attention.

However, what best shows the prosperity of the isolated island is that "forbidden books" are being reprinted everywhere", as if we are now living under the rule of a revolutionary government. But looking at the titles, the "forbidden books" are indeed "forbidden books", but they are all "forbidden" because the books are really obscene. Now our eyes are really blessed, and we can see so many good treasures. If this continues, I think "The Carnal Prayer Mat" and "Apricot Flower Heaven" and other "forbidden books" will soon be reprinted solemnly, Amen!

### "Spring"

— Liu Lan

Some people love the season when yellow leaves flutter and fallen flowers cover the ground. They wander in ancient paths in the setting sun of autumn, accompanied by their lonely shadows; or sit in the courtyard, gazing at yellow leaves, idly counting fallen flowers, but people say: "This is too old and late in life, young people should not abandon the world like this." However, it is said that the poet's wise eyes can still see "life" in autumn.

Some people also love the cold and severe winter, a vast expanse of white snow, a crystal world. It is said that this is also the temperament of a poet, and even more the character of a warrior. My thoughts then galloped in the wilderness, the open fields, and the icy and snowy lands. What is the state of mind of the fighters doing great work? Cursing or appreciating? Let the facts fill in the answer!

But I, an ordinary and mediocre person, long for spring, a vibrant and energetic season!

A voice rang in my ears: "Spring is here!" I don't know who whispered to me. The tone was so gentle and harmonious. Like adding fuel to the flame, it will become a moving love song. But I said faintly: "There is no spring here." Perhaps angered by this indifferent attitude, there was no reply, and the footsteps of the visitor gradually disappeared into the distance.

I opened the window and looked up. The sky was gray and gloomy, filled with dark clouds. A gust of wind blew from the distant sky. Could it be bringing the message of spring? I wondered. A pungent smell of blood rushed towards me, not the breath of spring. "There is no spring here," I muttered the sentence again. I closed the window tightly.

Driving a light boat of recollection, I swayed on the sea of memory: throughout the winter, I recited Shelley's famous line: "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" Yes, spring will come soon. But now, winter is gone, and there is still no spring here.

"Miscellaneous flowers grow on trees, and warblers fly in confusion." A scene of warmth and harmony, a charming scenery, is really easy to make people yearn for. But the fields of Jiangnan, no, the entire earth, are no longer tranquil and solemn. Demons have brought great turmoil. The plains are dotted with desolation: broken walls and dilapidated houses, bloody corpses, violated girls, and suffering children. Friends, is this a symbol of spring?

I tell you: "There is no spring here!"

But ah, I also want to tell you: "Spring will come." After the cultivation of sweat and the irrigation of blood, the earth will return to spring, and the intoxicating spring breeze will ripple in the fields.

But, in the end, I want to ask you: "How will you sweat and bleed for the earth—our mother?"

"Hey, you say, you say!"

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

"Today you are the father-in-law, I have nothing to offer, so I respect you with this cup, please don't refuse."

Town Chief Chen declined for a while, and seeing that he couldn't refuse, he raised the cup in front of him and said, "As you wish! As you wish! I'll drink it."

"No! You must drink this cup in front of me, that's the proper etiquette." One-eyed Li snatched Town Chief Chen's wine glass and replaced it with his own cup.

Town Chief Chen knew that One-eyed Li had seen through his plan, and refusing to drink would be self-defeating. He hardened his heart and laughed loudly.

"Ha! Ha! Do you suspect that I would poison you on this happy day? Since you don't believe me, I'll drink it to show you."

After saying that, he raised his neck and drank the poisoned wine in one gulp, then poured a glass of poisoned wine for One-eyed Li and earnestly urged everyone to toast. One-eyed Li saw that Town Chief Chen had finished the wine and no longer suspected him. The X army officer and the Pacification Squad leader certainly did not suspect anything either. At the same time, Town Chief Chen earnestly and bitterly persuaded them, and they couldn't refuse, so they unknowingly drank the wine in the cup.

With the wine in their stomachs, the talk and laughter became uninhibited. The X army officer and One-eyed Li kept teasing the Pacification Squad leader, who was so happy that he grinned and just laughed. One-eyed Li said to Town Chief Chen again:

"Your Miss Xiuyue and the Pacification Squad leader are really a match made in heaven."

Town Chief Chen was already suffering from abdominal pain, but he still forced a smile and said:

"Don't say that! I'm just afraid that my little girl is incompetent and not worthy to serve him!"

"This is East Asia Co... co..." The Pacification Squad leader couldn't finish the "co", he held his stomach with both hands and said, "Why does my stomach suddenly hurt!"

After he said that, the X army officer and One-eyed Li also felt abdominal pain, very uncomfortable, and couldn't help but glare at Town Chief Chen and asked:

"What's going on?"

Town Chief Chen couldn't bear the pain any longer. He left his seat, jumping and leaping, while still laughing loudly.

"Ha! Ha! Ha! What a celebration meeting, it's clearly a death meeting. You're taking the road to hell when there's a path to heaven..."

The X army officer was furious, pulled out his pistol, aimed it at Town Chief Chen's head, and fired a shot. With the firing of this shot, he himself, the Pacification Squad leader, and One-eyed Li all fell to the ground bleeding from all seven orifices.

This shocking live drama startled the X puppet troops who were indulging in pleasure and drinking, and they all gathered around to see what was happening. At this moment, suddenly, with a "boom" of a signal cannon, Commander Ye's troops had launched a counterattack from the east, west, and north roads into Hepu Town. (44)

Spring and Autumn

### Japan in Wartime

— Gong Huai

Since the Japanese army lit the fire of aggression on the Lugou Bridge, twenty-one months have passed. When the war first started, the Japanese soldiers were full of hope that they could "win a quick victory" and seize "a large amount of benefit" with "a small amount of force." They thought that adding planned political conspiracies to new weapons such as airplanes, cannons, and warships would easily make our country "kneel". But under the strong resistance of our army, "quick war and quick decision" has become a daydream, which was of course beyond the expectations of those who advocated militarism.

So, what is Japan like in wartime? Please see the following news, although they are all "trivial" social trends that seem "unimportant", but using the "small" to represent the "big", it is not difficult to imagine the results that the invaders deserve from here.

Professor Famine

According to news from the Japanese Ministry of Education, recently, in universities across the country, a large number of professors and assistant professors have been arrested or suspended for participating in People's Front groups or being reported for having anti-war thoughts. As a result, all universities deeply feel the professor famine, making it difficult for Minister of Education Araki to cope. Currently, six universities, including Tokyo Imperial University, have a total shortage of 169 professors and 162 assistant professors, which is truly an unprecedented phenomenon in the Japanese education sector.

Unable to Marry

Japanese women have not yet broken away from the constraints of feudal society. "Good wife and wise mother" is their highest moral standard. Most women take "marriage" as a shortcut to solve their lives, but recently, due to the protracted war against China, young men have been sent to the front lines in China in large numbers, and the number of casualties is so high. Invisibly, it has taken away the husbands of many Japanese girls, making it impossible for girls of marriageable age to find a marriage partner. According to a recent survey by the Tokyo Municipal Social Bureau, there are 200,000 in Tokyo alone. These young girls, unable to marry, have to wander the streets in search of jobs, but where are there so many ready-made positions to place these marriageable girls?

Horse-drawn Carriages Reappear

Gasoline is an important fuel in wartime, and Japan, which is poor, naturally regards it as a treasure and is unwilling to waste any more of it. Therefore, cars have become very rare in Tokyo recently, and most of them use charcoal as a substitute. Horse-drawn carriages, which have disappeared from Tokyo for decades, have reappeared to replace cars and freight trucks, as if returning to the early Meiji era. If the war does not stop, horse-drawn carriages will inevitably flood Japan.

Dismissal of Leaders

The result of the shortage of textiles will bring about a change in Japanese clothing. Soon, the new clothes of Japanese women must be shortened uniformly, which is a government order. In the future, Japanese girls will wear fashionable clothes without "collars" and "sleeves", and their underwear will be shortened to an alarming extent. Such a "chic" dress will be a special decoration in Tokyo at that time.

Fewer Babies

In a meeting of the Japanese House of Representatives, Ito Iwao, a member of the Seiyukai, asked Minister of Health Hirose about the decline in Japan's birth rate, expressing anxiety and asking the government to explain its countermeasures. According to Hirose's reply, the birth rate has indeed "significantly" decreased in this war of aggression. "The usual production of nearly two million per year is probably reduced by three to four hundred thousand." This is still the so-called official report, and the actual number should not be limited to this. Moreover, because people's lives are difficult, the mortality rate of infants and young children is also higher than usual, which is a serious social problem.

"The happy, cherry-blossom-like Japan has disappeared, and a shadow of sorrow covers every inch of land, and tears of sadness drip on everyone's heart"! These words of Sano Seki accurately describe the situation.

### Safety Movement

— Xin Liang

The continuous vehicle accidents caused by carelessness are currently the most serious problem in the United States. In order to reduce their number, I have appointed Secretary Robert and Senator Moore to jointly form a committee to conduct research on protecting national life and property.

Fortunately, due to the widespread dissemination of the various terrors caused by reckless driving through writing and other methods, countless drivers are now well aware of this fact; I have high hopes for them, because the solution to this serious problem must rely on the strength of all drivers.

May our lives be safer from now on. If only each of us, each family, is careful and mindful when walking or driving, and not reckless, then thousands upon thousands of people will certainly not die in vain under the wheels.

U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, on the first day of 1938, in view of the increasing number of vehicle accidents, specially issued the above remarks; his intention, of course, was to promote the attention and caution of every citizen, and to use collective strength to reduce the number of these unfortunate deaths. At that time, an article entitled "- And Sudden Death" was also published in a magazine called "Reader's Digest." The article analyzed the various causes of the serious problem of "vehicle accidents" in great detail and thoroughly. As expected, the attention of the entire American public was focused on "vehicle accidents." Needless to say, as proven by past facts, this safety movement in the United States was successful.

Now, Mr. Baker, the head of the Transportation Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, seeing the sudden increase in traffic accidents in Shanghai last year (it is reported that the death toll totaled 8,729 people, breaking all previous records), also wants to launch a safety movement, named "Safety Week"; its purpose and intention are exactly the same as the one conducted by President Roosevelt mentioned above, which can be said to be a coincidence. Whether viewed from the perspective of the life of every Shanghai citizen or from the perspective of the welfare of the entire society, this safety movement is indeed worthy of our advocacy and vigorous promotion. Why should we die in vain under the wheels due to the carelessness of others, and why should we accidentally crush a beloved compatriot who has no grievances or enmity?

In fact, the problem now is not that we do not know what to do about "vehicle accidents", but whether we can concentrate our minds and spirits to do everything we know about methods and precautions. The National Safety Council of the United States says: "If each of us applies everything we know to prevent vehicle accidents, then the number of these accidental deaths can be reduced by 50 percent." Therefore, every citizen of Shanghai, if you want your life to be safe, you must work hard to do everything that can prevent vehicle accidents, that is, you must do your best to support and promote this safety movement.

Secondly, in terms of education, we must also do our best to promote the importance of "caution", the terror of being crushed to death, and various "safety" concepts. Then, the effectiveness of the safety movement will also increase greatly, without a doubt. In addition, such as organizing "safety patrol teams", strictly enforcing traffic regulations, strictly holding examinations for vehicle drivers, improving traffic lights, and adding street lights...etc., are also worthy of our attention. In short, by holding this safety movement with the strength of all citizens, we will definitely ensure that our lives are "safe".

### Thoughts on "Fallen Rouge"

— Si Jing

"Fallen Rouge" is a very familiar story, and this story may be happening around us: a pampered young lady, because of the sudden change in her family, is forced onto a path of inevitable depravity, and finally, like a bubble rising from a pond, quietly ends her life, as if she had never come into this world. Can you deny that this is not a story happening around us? But when these poor lives leave this world, let's take a look at the people standing around her (including the executioners who killed her). Some sigh, some make terrifying cold laughter, and what about the executioners who killed her? He left without looking back. Then, other people left as if they had finished watching some excitement. They followed the people who left first to watch the second "excitement" happen, and so on countless times. After watching "Fallen Rouge", I had the same feeling as above. It only conceptually tells the audience such a story, but does not point out the dark side that created such a story, letting people see things they have never seen before, so that those who sigh feel their own weakness: those who laugh coldly feel their own cruelty, and are angry: as for those executioners, at least they can never be seen again.

Therefore, the biggest shortcoming of "Fallen Rouge" is its lack of proactiveness. First: Like the character Zhao Zhenni, she undoubtedly represents progressive women, but after seeing her once at school, she did not appear again until Lu Ming became a dancer, and this only appearance was so fragile!

Second: It is not enough to use a letter to show Jia Nong's destruction of the Huasha market. From the time he participated in Lu Ming's birthday party, we were more aware that he was a pseudo-gentleman who had ulterior motives for Lu Ming.

Really, if on the one hand, the progressive woman Zhao Zhenni can be emphasized, and the fall of Lu Ming can be contrasted on the other hand, and on the one hand, the oppression of national capital by foreign capital can be written more clearly, then this script will definitely be very meaningful.

### Huang Hua Gang (Ballad Singing)

— Yi Bai

There are two types of ballad singing: one is long-form, called "Manzi Huo," and the other is short-form, called "Duan'er Shu," also known as "Chang Pian." What is sung in today's "Luozi Guan" (entertainment venues) are all "Chang Pian," which are excerpts from long-form pieces. For example, "Dream of the Red Chamber" originally had thirteen sections, "Qianjin Quande" originally had eight sections, and "Fei Gongren Assassinating the Tiger" originally had four sections, all of which are obvious examples. Although this piece is not divided into sections, it uses Wen Shengcai's deeds as an introduction and the Huang Hua Gang event as the main text, making it a relatively long piece. As for the historical materials, I thank Brother A Ying for lending me the "Guangdong Uprising Compilation," which prevented me from indulging in speculation. Although the human world is ever-changing, the way of heaven is unpredictable. If you are willing to seek happiness for the people, you should not be afraid of suffering yourself. Grieving at the times, I wipe away heroic tears and use a few rustic words to mourn the country's demise, lamenting the corruption of the Qing Dynasty's late reign, the Empress Dowager's interference, and the court officials' servile and shameless behavior, completely forgetting the three hundred years of national subjugation. Four enlightened people tried to do what they could, only suspecting that the imperial system was going to abandon the reformists, and people's hearts were not of one mind, and they would support the emperor as well as reform. The secret was not kept, and the Empress Dowager found out, and an edict caused the Six Gentlemen to suffer. Internal affairs were neglected, leading to foreign insults, and the Boxers relied on their power and became arrogant. The Eight-Nation Alliance broke through Beijing, and the Summer Palace became their horse pasture. The Chinese nation suffered a collective humiliation, which ignited the nameless and uncontrollable fire in the hearts of patriotic heroes.

At that time, everyone was terrified at the mention of this person, Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Tongmenghui. For many years, Sun Yat-sen had been running around for the revolution without success, and had been exiled abroad due to being pursued. Seeing the difficulties of the times, he could not sit idly by, and hurriedly gathered comrades to discuss. He said, "The Qing emperor and his ministers have long been spiritually dead and buried in the grave. Let's take advantage of the last breath of life to restore the Han rivers and mountains with one heart." After the meeting, Shi Jianru was sent to sneak into Guangdong Province, and Zheng Shiliang was sent to start an uprising in Huizhou City. Who knew that support was lacking and both failed, Shi Jianru lost his life and Zheng Shiliang fled. Sun Yat-sen persevered without being discouraged, and thus staged this tragic historical drama, the Huang Hua Gang Uprising.

At that time, the forces supporting the emperor still existed, and the reformist party still had Tang Caichang as a survivor. Sadly, he was captured and executed for launching an uprising in Wuhan, and Qin Lishan was implicated in Anhui. From then on, the more the revolutionaries sacrificed, the stronger their will became. As the Xinhai year approached, the efforts of the revolution gradually intensified. The spring sunshine was bright on the tenth day of the third lunar month when a shocking event occurred in Guangzhou City. General Fu Qi, who also served as the Guangzhou General Commander, went to Yantang to watch the air force drills. After watching the planes, he returned to the governor's office, and as he passed by the Provincial Assembly, he was about to turn a corner. Suddenly, a loud shout came from the crowd, "Where are you going, you dog official!" A man with a short stature rushed out, holding a short gun and firing at Fu Qi, several shots rang out, and Fu Qi was wounded. Although there were dozens of guards, everyone was in a panic at the sound of the gunshots, and they abandoned the general and fled. The brave man charged back and forth as if he were in an empty realm, and fired another shot at Fu Qi, sending him to meet the King of Hell. In the chaos, he discarded the short gun and left. Who knew that a patrolman secretly followed him and encountered a Henan detective team on Yongsheng Street, which captured the brave man and sent him to the barracks. The three judicial offices interrogated him, but the brave man, with iron chains on his body, remained calm. He said, "My name is Wen Shengcai, and I am from Shunde. What are you beasts in official robes asking about? My original intention was to kill a tiger, but I mistakenly identified the imperial entourage and killed a sheep. So be it, I killed this thief to avenge the nation, as a warning to all of you, you must be fair. You ask me how many party members there are, there are truly thousands upon thousands, an endless sea of people. I see that you are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, honorable Chinese, why are you willing to flatter the enemy and act as accomplices? Kill me! Let you claim credit and receive rewards, and get promoted. Haha! You must be careful in the days to come." Wen Shengcai faced death bravely without any fear, and did not implicate others during the interrogation. On March 16th, he received an edict, and on the 17th, he resolutely went to the execution ground. On the way, he kept laughing loudly, his expression calm and composed. He even advised his compatriots to fight for the Han people. With the sound of a cannon, his head fell to the ground. Martyr Wen, his name is still fragrant today. (End of Part 1)

### Clear Skies After the Rain

Chapter 6: Praising Renrui's One Seed with Three Blossoms; Recounting Friendship, Two Gentlemen Meet Heroes

Some kindergarten students, who had left for eight or nine years, had trees that had not only grown taller than people but had also become lush forests. Some had just planted trees, just sprouting tender buds and branches, but they all wanted to see the trees they had planted themselves with their childhood feelings. Therefore, Principal Zhang would hold a reunion every year in May or June, when the trees were lush, inviting kindergarten students who had left the kindergarten and their parents to the kindergarten for a day of pleasant conversation. Various refreshments would be prepared, and they would sing or play games under the shade of the trees in the garden. The old kindergarten students who had graduated and the new kindergarten students who had not graduated were as loving as brothers and sisters. Seeing their own trees thriving, they really felt reluctant to leave. This year, at the reunion, one of the so-called old kindergarten students, who had been born in the women's and children's hospital here. He was an orphan, his father had died early, and his mother was not in good health, so he was also raised in the orphanage and had been a kindergarten student in the kindergarten. Now he was a second-year junior high school student, and the tung tree he planted was also very tall. Everyone elected him to give a speech. In his speech, there were a few words that, although somewhat childish, were very touching. He said, "I am fourteen years old this year, and it seems that I have already left the kindergarten life. But I still envy the happiness of the younger brothers and sisters. It's a pity that I can't shrink my body and be as big as them. It's a pity that this reunion is only one day. It would be great if it lasted for more than a week. But no matter what happens in the future, I will definitely come every year. I want to sit in the house where I was born, and I want to look at the tree I planted. I will definitely come every year, until my hair turns white, I am still an old kindergarten student of this kindergarten, I am considered an old brother among the younger brothers and sisters." Dr. Zhang Ting was also very touched when she heard this, and held his hand and just wouldn't let go. Now, because it was a clear autumn day, it was not suitable for outdoor activities. Although they were divided into four groups, they were still in one house, sometimes singing and playing games, and sometimes together. In this house, there were specially made small tables and small chairs. Each nanny managed a group. The clothes were also the same. The younger brothers wore black clothes, which were the clothes for the young boys. The younger sisters wore white clothes, which were the clothes for the young girls. Today, Ms. Tong Haiying heard that the two young girls, He Zong, had come to visit the kindergarten with Zhu Ai, and she personally came to entertain them. She asked the kindergarten students to bow to the two young ladies of the He family, and she herself played the organ, selecting the interesting little sisters who sang well, and sang for the two young ladies to listen to. It is exactly:

Several lines of ranks, new phoenix shadows, a song heard, the sound of farewell wind.

### In a World Filled with Gunpowder, Hollywood War Films are in a Frenzy—Arms Rental Businesses are Booming

— Daizi (Fool)

The Spanish war has not ended, the Sino-Japanese war is still in progress, and the powder keg of Europe, Czechoslovakia, is about to explode. In a world filled with the smell of gunpowder, Hollywood film companies have recently been competing to produce war epics.

In the film city, many studios have recently been filled with the sounds of swords and guns, presenting a tense military situation. Female stars apply menthol to their eyelids, so that when the male lead goes off to war, tears will naturally flow in their smiles. Every war film is like this.

Currently, Hollywood is producing all the war films it can. After Paramount's "Invasion" is completed, it may even allow us to discover a film that exposes plunder.

When Griffith was filming "The Birth of a Nation," a lot of money was spent on the war scenes. But now, the war films produced by various companies cost even more than back then. Temporary soldiers are paid $10.50 per day, and the rental fee for guns is $50 per thousand.

At Selznick's studio, the nighttime war scenes for "Gone With the Wind" have already begun filming. The burning of Atlanta scene is very grand. And these war scenes are all filmed using directorial techniques, and some of them are very magnificent.

There is a man named Stanbridge in Hollywood who has a large collection of weapons. He also keeps a lot of ancient weapons at Paramount Pictures. When film companies need weapons for war films, they rent them from him. Recently, the demand has surged, and he has made a fortune.

Because of the recent competition among companies to produce war films, Stanbridge's arms rental business has become very busy. "Hotel Imperial" needed 250 Austrian-style rifles, and the number of Russian-style rifles needed was equally large. At the same time, he also loaded these guns with smokeless powder, and the cartridges were filled with black gunpowder, which were used differently for daytime and nighttime filming.

Even in "Union Pacific," although it is not a true war film, when McCrea and his men resisted the Indian uprising, they used 210 rifles; and those rioters were at a disadvantage because they were holding old-fashioned rifles from 1863. Similarly, in "Heritage of the Desert," there is a scene that uses 50 rifles.

Stanbridge's biggest deal was to supply hundreds of new Spencer rifles and all the machine guns in his collection. But the problem of anti-aircraft guns and heavy artillery arose. The government may be able to help; but some of the weapons must be designed by the film company, so that people can get a deep impression, even though it is not a formal battle. When Warner began filming "Juarez," the war scenes would be filmed in Burr Place, and they had 400 old-fashioned rifles and some new guns, which was enough for the background of the film.

"Dodge City," starring Errol Flynn, needed 100 bulky old-fashioned guns and some small-caliber pistols. But there were not enough of them, so the extras who were not actually fighting all used fake guns made of rubber.

In Stanbridge's armory, there are a total of 660 British-made Lee-Enfield rifles. Recently, they have been transported to RKO every day in trucks, for the purpose of filming "Gunga Din." From now on, the same guns will have to be repaired and prepared for use in the war scenes of "The Light That Failed."

### Charlie Chaplin's Fiftieth Birthday

— Lu Degang

The silver screen humor master Charlie Chaplin is fifty years old this year. He was born on April 16, 1889, in Brixton. His father was a stage singer of some local renown, who died early, leaving behind a poor family. Chaplin's mother worked hard to raise Chaplin and his younger brother. At the age of fourteen, Chaplin played a supporting role in the play "Sherlock Holmes." At the age of seventeen, he joined the Karno Troupe as a clown. Later, through an introduction, he transferred to another theater troupe and went to perform in the New World. Soon after arriving in the United States, he was hired by Keystone Film Company as an actor. From then on, he rose rapidly, and his fame grew day by day. In total, almost every film he made after becoming famous was a sell-out. Chaplin's ability to attract audiences was not due to good fortune, nor was it due to his tattered boots and cane, but entirely due to his outstanding artistic talent and diligent training.

To commemorate the 50th birthday of this great artist, the entire United States will hold banquets to celebrate. At the same time, movie theaters across the country will exclusively screen films about Chaplin's life for a week. Therefore, recently, various production companies have been copying Chaplin's old films day and night in order to transport them to various places for screening. Chaplin has this honor, which is enough to be proud of!

### Wang Xianzai and His Wife Join Xinhua Together

— Yin Si

Star's Previous Negotiation Encountered Twists and Turns Xinhua Still Permits Future Borrowing at Any Time

Wang Xianzai, recently returned to Shanghai from Sichuan and Yunnan not long ago, has become a new prey in the film industry, immediately arousing competition among various companies to recruit him. Because he is a unique and outstanding talent for villain roles, he is truly "rare and valuable," and everyone needs him. Xinhua Film Company was represented by Han Langen to negotiate, and they first agreed on the contract terms. At the same time, Star Film Company, based on the long-term relationship between old hosts and guests, insisted that he must return to his old home. As a result, Wang Xianzai was in a dilemma and felt very hesitant. Seeing this stalemate, Star Film Company immediately asked Bian Yuying, the business director of Huacheng Film Company, to negotiate with Xinhua, requesting that he be allowed to return to Star Film Company for employment. Xinhua also accepted the request, in order to show consideration for the friendship of the industry. Later, Star Film Company learned that Wang Xianzai had already signed the contract and sent it to Xinhua; therefore, they did not want to destroy this accomplished fact and make him break the contract, and finally expressed their willingness to give way to Xinhua Film Company. At this point, the Xinhua authorities signed a contract with Wang Xianzai as a solution. Wang also determined his way out and joined the Xinhua camp. However, if Star Film Company needs Wang Xianzai for filming in the future, Xinhua can still borrow him at any time, relying on friendship. As a result of this outcome, everyone felt very satisfied. At the same time, Wang's wife, Yuan Zhu-ru, also signed a long-term contract and joined Xinhua with him.

### Jizi's Drama Talk

— Baochu

Ge Shishan is both vigorous and graceful, Yang Baosen's singing is melodious

Hiding from Qin on an isolated island, suffering a lot, occasionally entering the singing arena, also to borrow wine to dispel sorrow and long songs for crying. A few days ago, I was invited by a friend to visit the Golden Theater. When I arrived, Baosen's "Scolding Cao" was just coming on stage. The introduction, the setting, and the dialogue were all smooth and flawless, and the enunciation was strong and clean. The "flowing water" and "two sides" were pure and correct. The drumming can be called a masterpiece. Baosen and Baozhong both regard drumming as the standard for the current old student actors. The flexibility of the wrist and the crispness of the strikes, even Shu Yan and Fu Ying may sigh in admiration. I watched Guan Shaohua perform this before, and honestly, everything from Kuai downward is not worth mentioning. If Baosen can put more effort into facial expressions and costume plays, then he can be considered the successor to Shu Yan. There is no need to imagine a second person. Once, I watched him perform "Visiting Mother" with Zhang Eyun. During the crying scene and parting, Yan Hui raised his left foot as if to leave, and according to the routine, Liu Lang (played by Guan Shengxi) should kneel and hold his foot to show that he could not bear to let him go, which would show the emotions of the brothers. But Baosen raised his foot, and Liu Lang looked at it and rejected it, as if he wanted to reason but didn't. In reality, Sen had to stretch out and then withdraw. Not only those who watched felt uncomfortable, but the performer himself must have had strange feelings. Shengxi's voice is loud and the inside acting of an old man is outstanding. I hope he does not become arrogant, which would hinder his progress. After "Scolding Cao" was "Jinshan Temple," in which Yan Shishan played the White Snake in "Flooding Jinshan." The singing and speaking in the water battle and the fighting were all amazing. It is said that this play was personally taught by his uncle, "Nine Whirlwinds," and is the same as what Mei Lanfang performed. His makeup is charming, his posture is agile, and his balance on the stilts is steady. Among today's female roles, there is probably no one who surpasses him. Shishan is capable of many plays, such as "Hu Family Village," "Female Killing Four Doors," etc. This time, I have not yet seen him perform. I hope the authorities of the Golden Theater can arrange for him to perform them one by one and satisfy the eyes of the Shanghai people. Eyun then performed "Broken Bridge Offering Pagoda." According to the original "Broken Bridge" belongs to Kunqu Opera, but Eyun performed it in Luan Tan, which is inevitably inferior. Sheng Lan is capable in Kunqu, but that night he could not show his strength, which is really disappointing.

### Entertainment News

The 30th collection of "Honglian Temple" new play at the Gongwu Stage will be staged next Friday (31st). If rehearsals are not ready, it may be postponed to around April 3rd.

The Yifeng Drama Society at the Carlton Theater rehearsed two versions of "Wen Su Chen" last night, but the performance date has not yet been determined, possibly in a week or so.

The Gengxin Stage invited the female Dan Zhang Wenqin, and paid her a deposit of 300 yuan the night before, but Zhang returned the money and reached a compromise with the Cade Theater, re-entering the theater to perform, increasing the salary by 100 yuan, for a total of 650 yuan. Cade General Manager Dong Yong telegraphed to the Gengxin authorities to speak for her.

Female Dan Wang Xichun and Jin Suwen were sent by Chen Shaopeng from the United Film Company to the backstage of the Carlton Theater the night before to discuss the costume issues for the film "Wen Su Chen."

The Yin Xing Dance Troupe was hired by the Suzhou Grand Theater in Suzhou and is scheduled to depart on April 1st and take the stage on the 6th. The main actors are Xu Xu, Jin Liwa, and Chuan Ruiying.

The female actor who plays male roles, Yu Guifen, has had a recurrence of her stomach illness and is currently taking agarwood painkillers, which is very painful for her.

Another portrait of a certain lady: Since this lady's photograph was published in this journal, many readers have written to inquire about her background, current situation, ... and even several people have requested to meet her; I have already forwarded all the letters. According to her, "I am currently working hard to learn Mandarin, dance, music, and performing arts, etc., and it is not yet time for public presentation, please readers look forward to it."

### Secret History of the Forbidden City's Palace and the Pear Garden in the Old Capital (131)

— Xu Muyun

The Main Reason for Releasing Cao at Huarong Road

"Huarong Road" is a famous play by Da Tou (Big Head), and also an important show for Hongsheng (red-faced role) and Jing (painted-face role) to sing and dialogue. After Da Tou's death, Wang Fengqing also often performed it. Those in Shanghai who sing red-face plays mostly follow the San Mazi (Wang Hongshou) school. Twenty years ago, there was a person in Shanghai famous for performing Guan plays. In addition to Wang, who enjoyed the reputation of living Guan Gong, there were also Xia Yuerun and Zhao Ruquan. Zhao's performance was sometimes too casual, which led to the nickname of "slippery Guan Gong." San Mazi, being a member of the Anhui opera troupe, had a deep understanding of both singing and acting. His masterpieces, such as "Zhan Jing Tang," "Sao Song Xia Shu," "Xu Zai Pao Cheng," and "Xue Yong Lan Guan," are still models for later generations. People like Qi Lin Tong and Lin Shusen all took Wang as their model. Wang was born with phoenix eyes, which gave him a bit of majesty after dressing up. Moreover, he was very pious in worshiping Guan Di. Before each Guan play, he would fast and bathe, burn incense and kowtow. The next day, when he went to the backstage to dress up, he would also burn sandalwood in the room, kowtow, and then begin to dress up. From this time on, he would no longer talk to anyone. Before going on stage, he would sit high on a chair, and all the supporting characters in the play, such as Zhou Cang and Guan Ping, would kowtow to him, considering himself as a character in the play. Because he meticulously studied Guan Yu's character with great sincerity, and poured all his energy into performance, acting, recitation, and singing, his performance of Guan plays was naturally superior to everything else and worthy of the nickname of living Guan Gong. After his death, Lin Shusen and Jin Shaoshan jointly recorded a record of "Huarong Road." The flowing water sections they sang were extremely moving, and therefore publicized this play.

A very strange question is that since Kongming clearly knew that Cao Cao would take the Huarong Path after being defeated, he could have easily sent a general to capture Aman, who slipped through the net. However, he insisted on letting the brave and invincible Guan Yunchang take the military order, establish a military pledge, and let the powerful enemy go. This led to the various strange dramas of palace coups and usurpation. The four hundred years of the Yan Han Dynasty were eventually plundered by the Cao family. Isn't this clearly showing that Mr. Zhuge was taking Liu's dynasty too lightly? In fact, there is a great truth in this. For many years, not only the people who watched the play "Huarong Road" did not guess it, but also the people who read the Three Kingdoms thoroughly did not expect it. Bu Wang also heard it from an old opera fan. I will write it out and ask the experts for criticism and instruction.
