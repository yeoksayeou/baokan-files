Editorial

### Japan's Errors in Understanding

Discussing "Japan's Errors in Understanding" seems unnecessary for today's newspapers, as it has already been extensively discussed. However, I still want to address this issue because the tragic and severe evolution of the Far East situation causes deep sorrow for all who have compassion. How can we seek relief from suffering and find light in the darkness? Since Japan insists on its aggression, China can only achieve this through resistance. Only when China succeeds in its resistance can it achieve its own liberation and enlightenment. This is a joyous but arduous path for China. Before aggression exposes its own collapse, if Japan sincerely repents, both China and Japan can achieve liberation, and its enlightenment can benefit the entire international community. In the past, Japan was like a madman, not even considering repentance. Therefore, even pointing out its errors in understanding was merely a form of exhortation. Now, whether Japan has the sincerity to repent remains to be seen through future facts and signs. However, observing the recent sentiments within Japan, some people seem to be changing their ways of the past few years, even decades. This is not enough to prove its repentance, but it shows that it is aware of its desperate situation and seeks liberation. If it still misunderstands, it will only bring trouble upon itself. I sincerely hope to correct its errors.

There are countless examples of Japan's erroneous understanding. Recently, Japan has been seeking liberation on one hand while blaming others on the other. To illustrate with one example, it can be generalized to the rest. According to a Reuters report, the Japanese military spokesperson in Beiping claimed that Britain is using its influence to manipulate the National Government of China to prolong the Sino-Japanese War and deplete Japan's national strength. Therefore, it advocates expelling British influence to protect the survival of the East Asian people. None of these statements are true. It is China that is directly depleting Japan's national strength. From the beginning of Japan's armed aggression, China has explicitly stated that its resistance is a war of attrition, using the depletion of Japan's national strength as its basic strategy and daily tactic. The war was initiated by Japan, and it is the countries that continue to supply Japan with arms and ammunition that are prolonging the war and increasing Japan's consumption. Japan is acting like a madman, sparing no expense to send its gold reserves overseas. Japan does not care about consumption, so various countries supply Japan with what it wants to consume. Why blame others instead of reflecting on oneself? As for British influence, it must coexist with the people in the areas where its influence extends. If Britain attempts to exterminate the East Asian people, then the moment it attempts this, British influence in East Asia will collapse. If Britain's actions in China are contrary to the survival of the Chinese people, then British influence will be eliminated without Japan's intervention. Even if Japan is willing to be a bodyguard for British influence, it will be of no use. What is even more erroneous is to consider the National Government as being manipulated by Britain. We deeply and firmly believe that Britain cannot manipulate the National Government, nor can any other country. It is crucial to recognize that China's sole objective is the integrity of its sovereignty and territory. Under aggression, resistance is the only means to maintain this objective. China has always used this objective as the standard for distinguishing friends from enemies in the international community. In the past two and a half years, it has used the extent of each country's support for this means to distinguish the depth of friendship. This objective is unwavering and cannot be manipulated by Britain. Let alone Britain, if the Chinese government were to abandon or diminish this objective, it would not only fail to gain the support of the people, but would also be abandoned by them. In other words, the survival and demise of the government depend on this objective. How can other countries have room to manipulate it? Under this objective, means are used to adapt to the environment, and resistance is the way to adapt to aggression. The support that other countries provide to China, and the support that China accepts from other countries, must in fact be support for resistance. The core meaning still lies in the integrity of sovereignty and territory. If integrity is not achieved, then China will resist to the end, friendly countries will support to the end, and China will accept support to the end. Once sovereignty and territory are complete, there is no need for resistance in fact, and no other country can force China to continue the war. This is the inevitable boundary between China's resistance and other countries' support. It cannot be manipulated by Britain or other countries.

Japan still holds these erroneous understandings, so its attempts to seek liberation are not only self-deceiving in terms of understanding, mistaking it for helplessness, but also often leading it down the wrong path in terms of method, thus exacerbating its suffering. It claims to expel British influence, intending to threaten Britain and obtain a compromise that would benefit its liberation. Whether Britain fears the threat or is willing to compromise is another matter. Even if a compromise is reached through threats, even if the Anglo-Japanese compromise is somewhat detrimental to China's resistance, it is impossible for China to accept aggression and abandon resistance because of this. Why? Because the survival and demise of the Chinese government, and the support of the people, are based on the integrity of sovereignty and territory. The Chinese people view this as a matter of survival. Whether Britain compromises with Japan or not cannot shake this foundation. Japan's threats to Britain, and its recent attempts to ally with the Soviet Union and conspire to entice the United States, have the same outcome. It should be known that although China benefits from the support of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries in its resistance, China's resistance does not depend on the attitudes of these countries. It ends only when Japan's aggression ends. Aggression exists for one day, and resistance exists for one day. This means that Japan will suffer consumption for one day, suffering for one day, and will never find liberation. Recently, Japan's multiple efforts have failed because its sincerity for repentance is insufficient and its understanding of the principles is insufficient. Each of these contributes half the reason.

### The U.S. Will Decide Its Attitude Based on the Outcome of the Tokyo Talks; American Arms Dealers Are Only Interested in Profit; Italian Reporter Also Writes an Article Criticizing This

Washington: Well-informed sources stated today that the prospects for a swift and satisfactory commercial treaty between the United States and Japan are not promising. Washington officials declined to comment on the situation of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty and the announcement by Undersecretary of State Welles in November that the abolished treaty would not be reinstated. Secretary of State Hull yesterday refused to endorse the Grew-Nomura talks being held in Tokyo, only saying that he currently had nothing to say on the matter. Observers believe that the Tokyo talks are broad in scope and can only be used to determine whether there is a basis for future commercial negotiations. Judging by the approach taken by officials here, they feel that the Tokyo talks are too vague and are unwilling to make any criticism. Perhaps the United States is deliberately remaining silent to wait for Japan to take the initiative. Neutral parties today doubt the reports that the United States and Japan can reach a new agreement before the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty in January next year. Observers here are discussing the possibility of the United States and Japan extending the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty by exchanging notes to negotiate a transitional arrangement. They concluded that whether the United States will take this action depends entirely on whether other U.S.-Japan issues are resolved. It is generally believed that the final attitude of the U.S. government will be determined by the attitude of Congress. Congress will convene for three weeks before the expiration of the commercial treaty. Neutral parties doubt that there will be any change in Congress's attitude towards Japan. They believe that Congress will continue to support President Roosevelt's abolition of the 1911 U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. (8th United Press)

Rome: The "Roma Daily" correspondent in New York yesterday attacked the U.S. government for not implementing a ban on arms exports to Japan. It was reported that the U.S.'s Far East policy is entirely determined by economic purposes. The value of arms and raw materials imported into Japan from various countries totals 1,215,000,000 U.S. dollars, of which 161,000,000 U.S. dollars are supplied by the United States. Due to the current tense relations between the United States and Japan in China, the United States may implement a ban on arms exports to Japan. However, the United States is once again a victim of its blood money policy because arms manufacturers are unwilling to lose their highly profitable Japanese clients. (8th United Press)

### Those Who Pass the National Higher Examination Will Be Sent for Training First

Chongqing: Those who pass the preliminary examination and those who are on the waiting list for this year's National Higher Examination will be sent to the Central Political School for training.

It is reported that the Political School has scheduled the training to begin on February 1 next year. (8th dispatch)

London: According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, the League of Nations delegation led by Foreign Resolution Butler has flown to Geneva on a special plane due to the suspension of flights between London and Paris. The League of Nations Administrative Council meeting may be postponed for 48 hours if the British delegation cannot arrive on schedule. (8th Reuters)

Geneva: The Soviet Union is unlikely to be forced to withdraw from the League of Nations, and European powers are unlikely to formally propose to the League of Nations General Assembly to force the Soviet Union to withdraw from the League of Nations. Britain and France are currently unwilling to participate in the plans of South American countries to deal with the Soviet Union. Diplomatic circles here believe that the League of Nations General Assembly will be very short, and the League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution will not provoke the Soviet Union, but will only condemn the Soviet Union's actions. (8th Huitong)

### Finland Asks All Countries to Provide Tangible Assistance; Not Just Empty Promises

Fenjing: A Finnish Foreign Ministry spokesman told Reuters, "The Finnish people are now asking, what will the world do for Finland? Everyone is giving sympathy, but what we need is not just sympathy. If no one comes to help Finland, how can this small country of 3 million people resist the Soviet Union of 180 million people forever? Finland may be destroyed and meet the same fate as Poland, or even worse. Empty promises are useless. Providing immediate assistance in the form of arms and troops is the key. Finland's failure will have a greater impact on Britain, France, and the world than Poland's failure. Germany must also consider it. The Soviet Union now considers it its ally, but what opportunities will Germany have even if it can control Britain and France?" (8th Reuters)

London: European countries are providing assistance to Finland's resistance. Currently, Italy, Germany, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Sweden are supplying Finland with arms and raw materials. British aid to Finland has also begun, and France will also begin to provide assistance. The United States may directly provide Finland with economic aid. Finland's resistance can last for at least several months. Anti-Soviet sentiment is rising daily throughout Europe. Countries such as Italy may provide direct assistance to Finland in the form of manpower and arms. (8th United Press)

Fenjing: The Finnish government neither confirms nor denies reports that European countries, including most belligerent and neutral countries, are supplying Finland with arms and other materials. It is said that the Finnish government warmly welcomes assistance from any party. (8th United Press)

London: According to news last night, British manufacturers will supply Finland with 20 to 50 aircraft. Some have already been transported to Finland. Although there is no confirmation on how these aircraft are transported, it is speculated that they are first shipped out by fast cargo ships, and then take off to Finland when they are a considerable distance away. (8th United Press)

London: According to reliable sources, 60 Italian aircraft, piloted by Italian pilots, have already flown through Germany to Finland. This is the first batch of Italian aircraft to assist Finland. (7th Havana)

Washington: Red Cross Chairman Davis stated after discussing aid to Finland with President Roosevelt yesterday that the United States will immediately ship 50,000 sets of surgical instruments from New York to Finland via Bergen, Norway, and will hold a national fundraising campaign. Given the current public sentiment in the United States, the goal of 3 million U.S. dollars can definitely be achieved. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau also stated that negotiations between the Treasury Department and the "Export-Import Bank" have been underway for a month, with the aim of enabling Finland to obtain loans.

### Soviet Army Advances Aims to Cut Off Finnish Forces Heavy Snow and Fog in Finland Aerial Forces Unable to Operate

Helsinki Sources here now believe that Soviet troops intend to invade 120 miles into Finnish territory, reaching Baiweifanimimi in the Gulf of Bothnia, to cut off the Finnish army. The Soviet army claims to have advanced to a point 97 miles from Bai Luofanimimi, less than 65 miles from the railway. Cutting off this railway would be a very important victory. The Finnish side says that the Soviet army has only advanced twelve miles and is still more than thirty-seven miles from the railway. (8th Reuters dispatch)

Stockholm Fierce battles have occurred in the vicinity of Petsamo, with heavy Soviet casualties. Finnish troops remain calm and are fighting back. The large Soviet force that crossed the Karelian Isthmus has apparently been blocked. Heavy fighting has also occurred northeast of Kemijärvi, where 3,000 Soviet troops have been routed. Due to heavy fog yesterday, there was no aircraft activity within Finland. Soviet warships are currently searching for Finnish warships off the Swedish coast. (8th Reuters dispatch)

Moscow The Leningrad Military District Headquarters issued a battle report stating that in the direction of Murmansk, Soviet troops crossed minefields and advanced 45 li south from Petsamo.

In the eastern part of the Karelian Isthmus, Soviet troops, after breaking through the main Finnish position at Valkeasaari, advanced eight to twelve kilometers north of the Tayberinioki River. In the western part of the Karelian Isthmus, Soviet troops occupied the Pogdevei station and city on the Vyborg railway and advanced nine kilometers northwest, while also occupying the coastal railway stations of Kerga, Yunshickge and Norris Jie Wei. The air force was inactive due to heavy snow and fog. (8th TASS dispatch)

The main Finnish forces have all safely withdrawn according to the original plan. "The climate is a friend of Finland." Helsinki was peaceful all day yesterday because of the heavy fog.

### British Labor Circles Condemn the Soviet Union Spain Shows Sympathy for Finland

London The British Trades Union Congress recently issued a statement expressing shock and indignation at the Soviet Union's attack on Finland. They expressed their admiration for the courage and perseverance of the Finnish people in resisting aggression and urged all free countries to provide practical assistance to Finland to enable it to carry out its struggle to defend civilization and democratic institutions. The statement accused the Soviet Union of violating its obligations to Finland and attempting to seize bases within Finnish territory by force in order to endanger the freedom and security of the countries around the Baltic Sea. The Soviet Union clearly intended to annex Finland. It also stated that "Soviet imperialism has now revealed that the methods it employs are in complete alignment with those of National Socialism, which the British working class is currently united in resisting. In view of the facts that have recently occurred, the British labor movement now completely denies the Soviet Union as the leader of the world's working-class movement, the interpreter of socialism, and the protector of international peace." (8th Reuters dispatch)

Madrid The Cabinet held a meeting today and subsequently issued a communiqué stating, "The international situation has reached a critical juncture, and the government authorities are closely monitoring it. Since the outbreak of the war, European countries have encountered an abnormal situation. The Soviet Union's invasion of Finland is one of the inevitable consequences. Our country has previously fought for Western civilization, and now we express our deep sympathy for the heroic resistance of the Finnish people." (8th Havas dispatch)

### Germany Blames Nordic Countries

Berlin This morning's newspapers carried an official communiqué reviewing Germany's relations with the Scandinavian countries. The Berlin Financial News published a major portion of the communiqué in large type, condemning the Scandinavian countries for neglecting relations with Germany due to British influence in recent years. This relationship is based on geographical location. The Scandinavian countries have repeatedly resolved to offer guarantees of neutrality, but often adopt a non-neutral attitude.

### Soviet Union Notifies Denmark, Norway, and Sweden Blocking the Finnish Coast Effective from Noon Yesterday

Copenhagen The Ministry of Commerce announced yesterday morning that the Danish Minister to the Soviet Union had received notification from the Soviet government that the Soviet blockade of Finland would take effect at noon today. Foreign ships must leave the blockade area by noon on Saturday, after which this area will become a "dangerous zone." (8th United Press dispatch)

Berlin Regarding the Soviet blockade of the Finnish coast, the German semi-official agency Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur issued a message stating that the Soviet government today issued a notice to the Swedish and Norwegian embassies in the Soviet Union, stating that the Soviet government, in response to the request of the "Finnish Democratic Republic Government," has decided to blockade the country's coast from today.

Afterwards, the Finnish coast and the basin of the Duolna Afu River (on the border between Sweden and Finland), from the river mouth to 23 degrees east longitude, will be regarded as a dangerous zone. However, the territorial waters of the Aland Islands will not be blockaded unless they are used directly or indirectly as a base for military operations to attack the "Finnish Democratic Republic."

### German Anti-Blockade Measures Decide to Step Up Submarine Warfare Claiming Armed Merchant Ships Are Subject to Attack British Charter of Neutral Ships Confirmed

Berlin The German government published an official gazette last night, stating that armed merchant ships and armed fishing boats are not protected under the 1936 Submarine Convention. The gazette pointed out that the British Secretary of the Navy, Churchill, declared in a speech to the House of Commons that 1,000 British merchant ships have already been armed and that the number will soon double. When merchant ships and fishing boats are armed, managed by the navy, and attack enemy submarines on the surface of the water, they can no longer be protected by the Submarine Convention. Therefore, Germany's attack on armed ships does not violate international law, as international law will never restrict unilateral action and put itself in danger of suicide. (8th Huitong)

London Regarding the British Secretary of the Navy, Churchill's announcement in the House of Commons that the UK is currently chartering neutral ships, the London official arena confirmed this last night, saying that the Shipping Department has begun to control millions of tons of neutral ships. This approach will benefit the owners of neutral ships, as the British government will bear the responsibility of war risk, and the interests of the shipowners will be stable. The chartered ships will be escorted by the British Navy to and from various ports. Recent weeks of experience have shown that British ships in the convoy system are safer and less likely to be attacked indiscriminately by Germany than neutral ships engaged in normal commercial transportation without naval escort.

Amsterdam The Dutch people are outraged by the news that the Dutch transport "Taijiang Duen VIII" was sunk by a torpedo. This ship is the largest merchant ship lost by the Netherlands since the outbreak of the war. The Dutch believe that Germany recently threatened the Netherlands, and immediately after receiving the Dutch reply, it bombed and sank a Dutch ship. The aggressive attitude can already be seen. Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands personally visited the flooded areas to defend against the enemy and inspected various military preparations. After Germany's new threat, the Dutch defense is no longer a secret. German officials are extremely resentful upon learning that British Consulate officials inspected cargo on Dutch ships at a certain port in the Netherlands at the suggestion of Dutch shipowners. This move could prevent delays in inspecting contraband. However, Germany pointed out that this was a serious act by the Netherlands to undermine its neutrality. It is expected that the pressure exerted by Germany on the Dutch government will increase in the future. (8th Reuters dispatch)

### Romania Forbids Rumor-Mongering

Athens The Romanian Foreign Minister, Giaffenco, met with a special correspondent of the Greek newspaper yesterday and stated that the purpose of Romania's policy is to maintain its own balance as much as possible and maintain friendly relations with all belligerent countries. The German-Romanian trade agreement is an excellent tool for mutually beneficial trade exchange, and it is also an effective way to maintain peace in difficult times. Our friendship with all belligerent countries does not obligate Romania to participate in the war. As for the neighboring countries in the Black Sea, we believe that their position does not conflict with our peace policy. Soviet-Turkish relations are very important. We believe that the temporary interruption of Soviet-Turkish negotiations will not affect the friendly relations between the two countries. (8th Huitong dispatch)

Rome The French Havas reporter stationed in Rome, Niger, has been forcibly deported by the Romanian authorities for spreading inaccurate information. This is not the first time that Niger has published news unfavorable to the Romanian government. Recently, after a German economic delegation arrived in Rome, Niger issued two reports, one stating that the Romanian Minister of Finance had gone abroad and the other stating that the leader of the German delegation had made dissatisfied remarks. Both matters were completely fabricated and had no basis, and their purpose was nothing more than to disrupt the normal economic relations between Germany and Romania. The Romanian government has also banned the sale of the Paris Soir and Le Jour newspapers in Romania and confiscated them all because they published inaccurate news stating that Romania's neighboring countries had threatened Romania, which does not correspond to the facts.

### Maginot Line Improvements Constitute a Vast Defense Enemy Cannot Cross the Line

Paris According to sources from responsible military circles in France, since the outbreak of the war, the General Staff has made further improvements to the Maginot Line. In the past three months, French soldiers have put down their rifles and picked up axes and shovels, constructing many new defensive fortifications, consuming no less than thousands of tons of steel and cement. From now on, from near Geneva on the western border of Switzerland in the south to the port of Dunkirk in France in the north, a vast and boundless defense zone has been formed. Regardless of whether the enemy uses aircraft, land bombardment, infantry assaults, or tank attacks, they will not be able to cross the line. In other words, before the outbreak of the war, the defense of northeastern France was based on the underground Maginot Line (this line stretched from near Basel on the northern border of Switzerland in the south to the city of Longwy in France in the north). At this time, there are plans to strengthen it, and a second line of defense has been set up in front of, behind, and on both sides of this line. This new line of defense is mainly composed of steel and cement fortifications, with obstacles, minefields, various traps, bunkers, and air-raid trenches to defend against tanks placed in front of it. These scattered fortifications are spread throughout the area in large numbers and are roughly the same as the deployment of the German Siegfried Line. Military circles have said that from now on, the defense of northeastern France will combine the advantages of the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line. The former's advantage is its solidity and stability, while the latter's advantage is its intricate coordination. From now on, not only will the border between France and Germany be worry-free, but also the borders with Belgium and Switzerland will be secure. (7th Havas dispatch)

### Daily Spokesperson Slanders England

A Chinese newspaper in Beiping, under Japanese control, published remarks made by the Japanese military spokesperson here to Chinese journalists, stating, "England currently possesses forty percent of the world's wealth, yet it is not satisfied and seeks to seize interests elsewhere. Under the guise of the League of Nations, England seeks to exclude any country that slightly resists its desires. However, many countries still do not realize this and continue to cooperate with England, such as the Chongqing government. England treats all countries in the same way, even its own people in America are no exception. England gained victory in the last war through American financial aid, but as a result, England repudiated American debts and expanded its North American market to compete with American products. Isn't England's conspiracy terrifying? England uses the power to influence the Chongqing government to prolong the Sino-Japanese War, depleting Japan's national strength, in order to reap its own benefits. The Kuomintang regime has failed to understand this conspiracy, resulting in the war not ending and peace not being achieved. There is no other way but to overthrow England. You gentlemen are journalists, and I hope you will remember this point and make the Chinese people understand England's conspiracy. If East Asian nations wish to continue their survival, they must rise up and expel England's dangerous influence in East Asia. I graduated from an American university and have traveled abroad for seven years, so I know world events in detail." (Reuters, 8th)

In the area of Wenxi, Xia County, Anyi, and Yuncheng in southern Shanxi, the Japanese have recently increased to more than 10,000 troops.

They were met with resistance on separate routes, and after fighting fiercely until the morning of the 2nd, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties and their offensive was greatly frustrated. At dawn on the 3rd, the Japanese reinforced in large numbers from Tongshan and Daji, launching a counterattack on separate routes. Both sides engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat, killing more than 400 Japanese troops throughout the night. Until the morning of the 4th, fierce battles were still raging in the east and west of Meitian.

On the evening of the 30th, the Chinese sent a team to cross the river and attack Taiping Temple and Luojia in separate directions. The Japanese were caught off guard and the Chinese rushed into Luojia, killing a large number of Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese troops in Taiping Temple are still being besieged by the Chinese. At the same time, more than a thousand Japanese troops in the Fengxin and Jing'an areas launched a combined infantry and artillery attack on Dongnao Mountain, Huangshan, and Yuqiuzi Cliff.

### Japanese and Puppet Regime in Xiamen Seize Economic Rights of the People: Three Major Companies and Enterprises Forcibly Taken, Fertile Farmland in Heshan All Enclosed

Fuzhou Correspondence: After Xiamen fell, the Japanese immediately organized the so-called "Japan-China Co-prosperity Society" as an organization to win over traitors. A man named Xu Jizhen from Aozi, because of his flattery of the Japanese, sold the fertile land and fish ponds that were the lifeblood of his ancestors' hard work and his clansmen to the Japanese, establishing the "Shi Chang Farm" to grow vegetables and raise fresh fish. Soon, Xiamen and Hebei were blockaded by the Chinese army on all sides, and vegetables cost four or five jiao per catty, and fresh fish cost one yuan and several jiao per catty. The Japanese made a great fortune, while Xu Jizhen became a beggar, receiving beatings everywhere. The Japanese then occupied the "Wushi Pu" and "Maolin" farms in Heshan, and at the same time controlled all the trees on the mountain peaks. It was at the time when Xiamen and Hebei were eating thatch and cooking bones that firewood cost about one jiao per catty, and the Japanese were already laughing and accumulating gold. However, they still felt it was not enough, and simply announced that all mountain rocks were public land, and Chinese were not allowed to take a flower or a tree. This is what they meant by co-prosperity. During the heyday of the "Co-prosperity Society", Taiwanese leaders Chen Changfu and Lin Mutu took the opportunity to set up the "Fu Da Company" and contracted the Xiamen Dou electricity, water, and telephone companies from the Japanese military authorities. Their seizure of enterprises was particularly prominent. Another Taiwanese, Chen Xuehai, also organized the "Nanhai Company" to wholesale local livestock and vegetables, forcibly extracting protection money. Taiwanese thug Fang Binghui, relying on his long-term residence in Xiamen, and being familiar with the fishermen, also quickly organized the "Xiamen Nanhai Maritime Fisheries Company." As a result, other similar organizations sprang up like mushrooms, and all were named "Association" and "Cooperative," in order to carry out business with a small investment and large profit. Therefore, their stores were named "Association," as if they held an iron certificate and a cinnabar book, and others could not compete with them. The so-called "Cooperative" was not a store or company, but an organization that plundered profits and monopolized business, such as the "Pig Teeth Cooperative," "Vegetable and Fruit Cooperative," "Material Cooperative," and "Aquatic Products Cooperative," all set up to extract "look-over money" from various industries and restrict the development of merchants.

The "Xiamen Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board," seeing where the profits lay, also rose up to compete. With the posture of Mount Tai pressing down on the top, they first held the electricity, water, and Shan Hai Ice Factory, which were known as the three major companies in Xiamen, in their mouths, and then ordered their lackeys Li Sixian, Lu Yongchuan, Jin Fusheng, and Chen Shifu to sign and acknowledge it. The method of their seizure was: (1) the original factory's property and assets were converted into Chinese shares, managed by the puppet city government on behalf of the original shareholders; (2) the Japanese side determined that the amount of shares exceeded the Chinese side, but the principle was not to pay capital; (3) except for Li Sixian who was nominally the chairman of the board, all general managers, managers, engineers and other staff were filled by Japanese. As a result, the "Xiamen Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board" had more than half of the assets of the three major companies in Xiamen without spending a penny. So this is what they meant by liaison. Originally, there were several "pawnshops" and "small pawnshops" run by Taiwanese who lent money at high interest rates in Xiamen. The Japanese declared that the "new regime" would thoroughly assume the responsibility of relieving the people's livelihood for a bright society, and specially established the "Municipal Public Pawnshop" and "Capital Loan Office" to facilitate the circulation of finance and eliminate the evils of private operation. Therefore, they ordered all "pawnshops" and "small pawnshops" in the city to close down and themselves engaged in the business of high-interest exploitation. This way of making money was only for the sake of "self-prosperity." Recently, puppets Xu Gushan and Jin Fusheng, and others, drooled over the fertile land of Heshan, and immediately came up with a whimsical idea to report to the Japanese army and ask for "experimental planting of agricultural and forestry reclamation land," and listed the scope: the first district was Houkeng Village, the second district was Gaolin Village, and the third district was Dongzhai Village. The Japanese army, seeing where the profit lay, immediately agreed. As a result, they announced the expansion of the seizure, and immediately announced that the cultivated land of Houkeng Village, Xiguo Village, Dianqian Village, Dongzhai Village, Shicun Village, Lingyao Village, Fanghu Village, and Gaolin Village would all be confiscated in order to achieve mass production. The villagers of each village cried out to heaven and earth, as if they had lost their parents.

When Fang Tianhua, the head of the Xiachong Village in Heshan, led the Japanese to survey the cultivated land that was the lifeline of the entire village, along with the traitors Jin Fusheng and Lin Shen, he and the villagers shed tears and gnashed their teeth, hoping to fight the traitors and others. It turned out that the Japanese discovered that there were large amounts of hot springs in the fields of the village, which could be used to build several large bathhouses for profit. Unfortunately, they broke into their fate. However, when the traitors and the Japanese brought wolf-like detectives to the village to survey and excavate every day, they had to petition first in unison. When their feet stepped into the puppet city government, the vicious puppet police barked loudly. Everyone thought that "fighting over a wife and seizing land is like sleeping in death," and it was better to die fighting than to starve to death. They plucked up their spirits and took another step forward. The traitorous wolves and dogs stabbed wildly at the weak spots with their guns and sticks. Seeing that the situation was unstoppable, everyone "cried injustice" and dispersed. After a chaotic afternoon and a sleepless night, the next day, they decided to submit a petition to cry out for grievances. They paid ten yuan to a shyster in the "Scrivener's Association" to write a complaint and sent it to the puppet government. After a month or so, they saw a notice posted saying "Difficult to approve." So Fang Tianhua and others were anxious. Returning to the village, seeing the land left by their ancestors' blood and sweat being excavated under the supervision of the Japanese, they felt like their intestines were being cut by a knife and their hearts were on fire. They immediately came forward with the villagers to stop them. At that time, the traitors and the Japanese, seemingly thinking that the public anger was hard to offend, immediately fled. That night, they reported to the Japanese military authorities. The Japanese military ordered Li Sixian to handle it. So the next afternoon, Fang Tianhua, who was walking on Zhongshan Road, was arrested by Jin Fusheng and subjected to "corporal punishment to serve as a warning." The next morning, the two puppet newspapers, with "clever words and cover-ups," published a message stating, "The Xiamen Special Municipal Government, in order to promote the construction of a happy land, develop agriculture and forestry, and carry out a plan to open up wasteland in the Heshan area, cultivate agriculture, revive rural prosperity, and enhance agricultural production, in order to thoroughly rescue the bankrupt rural areas and the unemployed farmers, and thereby develop the rural economy, the municipal government has sent personnel to measure the wasteland area in the hot spring zone of Xiachong Village in Heshan, firmly erected boundary markers, so that wasteland owners can declare the acreage and buy it as public land according to the land price for agricultural development plans. Unexpectedly, Fang Tianhua, the head of Xiachong Village, was ignorant, misinterpreted the good policies of the authorities, deceived the association, and spread all kinds of rumors, threatening and instigating the villagers of the village to refuse to declare. The matter was detected by the municipal government authorities. The head of the village, as the head of a village, should assist in the implementation of the authorities' wasteland reclamation plan to build the countryside. Instead, he incited the villagers to obstruct government orders, which is really wrong. Considering his youthful scholarship, he was given a light sentence. Yesterday, the director of the Finance Bureau, Jin, summoned the head of the village to the government, gave him a brief reprimand, and explained in detail the authorities' good intentions to love the farmers and revitalize agriculture, so that he could understand and thereby promote the implementation of agricultural and forestry construction." Clearly, it was a seizure of land, but they said it was a good intention, which can be described as utterly devoid of conscience.

### Chairman of the Taixian Chamber of Commerce Cao Deliang Dies: Military and Political Authorities Hold Memorial Service

Taixian Correspondence: Cao Deliang, the standing chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and a member of the Subei International Relief Committee, and the father of the writer Cao Mengyu, has been handling military service and resettling refugees since the outbreak of the War of Resistance. He also served as the director of the Food Regulation Office. The military and political authorities consulted him on everything. He worked diligently day and night, not avoiding difficulties. Taixian has been as solid as a rock to this day, thanks to Cao's efforts. Unexpectedly, he suddenly suffered a stroke on September 30 and passed away. The people of the entire county mourned him. The military and political authorities felt as if they had lost an arm. Various agencies and legal entities held memorial meetings. Li Mingyang, the commander-in-chief of the Subei, Luanhui Border Area Guerrilla Forces, and Li Changjiang, the deputy commander-in-chief, held a memorial service in the headquarters. The eulogy stated, "Heaven is unjust, not leaving an elder. All our soldiers and civilians mourn in unison. You, sir, led the masses. In this national crisis, you exhausted your intelligence. You supported the army and maintained order. You rescued more than 50,000 refugees. The rear work was extremely diligent. You devoted yourself to the war. Your death is a loss to the country. The people of the entire county are as if drunk." Li Mingyang and Li Changjiang also gave慷慨激昂 speeches, praising him to the utmost, with tears in their eyes. Everyone present was moved.

In addition to the conference earnestly discussing and making it a perfect plan for implementation, there are still matters that should be paid attention to by the conference. In these cases, inappropriate phrases such as "Greater Chinese National Unity" and the current erroneous concepts popular in society are the same, which have a very dangerous impact on the future of the War of Resistance and nation-building. The conference decided to request the central government to issue an order that the abusive use of terms such as Miao, Yi, Man, Yao, Guo, Dong, and other ethnic minorities should be prohibited in the future) and other cases, as well as five cases decided by the conference to be sent to the ministry for reference, there are also fourteen other cases on frontier education that are incorporated into the "Frontier Education Improvement Plan" for discussion, with the proposal of the Ministry of Education as the main one.

### Issuance of Fractional Currency Notes Yesterday: Alleviation of Auxiliary Coin Panic, 5 Million Yuan in One-Yuan Legal Tender Also Arrived, Auxiliary Coins to Return to Shanghai at the End of the Settlement Period

To alleviate the panic due to the shortage of auxiliary currency notes, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, with the approval of the head office, began to gradually issue the second batch of fractional currency notes yesterday. At the same time, a large quantity of one-yuan notes arrived and were distributed by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications as much as possible to regulate the market. Therefore, the panic regarding one-yuan notes, auxiliary currency notes, and fractional currency notes is gradually being resolved. Details are as follows:

Second Batch of Fractional Notes Issued Yesterday

The second batch of fractional currency notes, amounting to 500,000 yuan, was printed by the American-owned Wing On Company. The contract for the third batch of fractional currency notes was finalized yesterday. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank began to gradually issue the second batch of fractional currency notes yesterday, initially distributing them to 46 member banks of the Bankers' Association and 42 member money shops of the Money Dealers' Association, with amounts ranging from 100 to 500 yuan per institution. Many large companies, businesses, and factories have requested to receive these notes, and their requests are being reviewed separately. Once the quantities are determined, they will be notified to collect them. It is reported that each of the four major companies will initially receive 500 yuan. The total amount of fractional currency notes issued yesterday was approximately 100,000 yuan.

Five Million Yuan in One-Yuan Notes Arrive in Shanghai

In view of the shortage of one-yuan notes in the Shanghai market, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have been providing as many of their existing one-yuan notes, both new and old, as possible to various banks and money shops for circulation in the market. All member banks and money shops of the Bankers' Association and the Money Dealers' Association can apply to the three banks to receive these notes. In addition, a large quantity of new one-yuan notes, printed by the Central Bank, has arrived in Shanghai via the British-owned HSBC Bank, with the aim of regulating market demand. It is reported that many banks and money shops exchanged for these notes at the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications starting yesterday. The amount of one-yuan notes that arrived is said to be 5 million yuan, so there should be no further shortage of one-yuan notes in the future.

Substantial Inflow of Auxiliary Coins into the Interior

A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking and money-changing circles yesterday that since the population of Shanghai has increased and silver dollars and nickel coins have disappeared from the market, the need for auxiliary currency notes has increased even further. Although financial institutions have repeatedly increased the issuance and supply of these notes, it should be sufficient to meet demand. However, due to the extremely high demand in the interior, the quantity of auxiliary currency notes flowing from Shanghai to the interior, though not statistically quantified, must be very large and continuous. This is why the panic over auxiliary currency notes in this area has persisted for so long. However, due to the increased ease of circulation between the interior and Shanghai, the outflow of auxiliary currency is now increasing daily, and the impact on Shanghai is gradually becoming noticeable.

Merchants' Demand for Goods Acquisition is Pressing

Copper and nickel coins in the occupied areas have been melted down and have disappeared completely. Even some of the auxiliary currency notes circulating in the city are inevitably lost or scattered due to the displacement of refugees. Financial institutions in the occupied areas have either relocated or closed down, so there is no source of supply or central collection point for auxiliary currency notes. The speed of circulation among commercial users is decreasing, so the quantity needed is enormous. Moreover, it is harvest season. This year is still considered a bountiful year. Merchants going to the interior to purchase goods must bring auxiliary currency notes with them. Furthermore, the area where they are used is extremely wide. All cities, towns, and villages connected to Shanghai by train and ship require auxiliary coins and currency notes.

Return is Inevitable at the End of the Settlement Period

The supply and demand and circulation of currency often shift with the seasons. In the past, it was customary in Shanghai for the autumn to be a lending season. At the time of the autumn harvest, merchants flocked to the interior to purchase goods, so the demand for auxiliary coins increased, and many auxiliary coins flowed into the interior. When the settlement period at the end of the year arrived, the loans would flow back to Shanghai. This was the case in peacetime; it is even more so today. In peacetime, although the scale of financial institutions in the interior was smaller than that of Shanghai, they could still naturally regulate collection and distribution. Now, however, the financial focus of the interior is in Shanghai, so the relationship between supply and demand is even closer. When currency notes are needed, Shanghai is the source. When commercial settlements are completed, the currency notes will inevitably return and concentrate in Shanghai.

### The British Consul-General Protests Against False Authorities Extorting House Taxes, British Residents Outside the Boundary Have No Obligation to Pay Taxes to the False Finance Bureau

Sir Philip, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, has lodged a protest with the "Mayor," Fu Xiao'an, because the "Finance Bureau" of the "Da Dao Municipal Government" in the western district of Shanghai is attempting to collect "house taxes" from British residents in the extra-settlement road area, and has recently resorted to threats and harassment. The residents find the harassment unbearable. The protest states that it is inappropriate for the "Finance Bureau" to collect "house taxes" from British residents, and that British residents living in any lane outside the boundary in western Shanghai have no obligation to pay taxes to the "Da Dao Municipal Government." British residents should continue to pay house taxes through the Shanghai Municipal Council as before. The protest also points out the incident on the morning of the 6th, when two tax collectors from the "Finance Bureau," Yao Ping and Liu Yongqing, extorted "house taxes" from British residents at No. 7 C-section, Difeng Road.

### Adopting Emergency Measures to Suppress Rice Prices, Delivery Limited to Three Days After Transaction, Strict Punishment for Violators Starting Today

Since the Shanghai Rice Dealers' Association jointly decided to contribute to the Market Management Committee, shortening the deadline for rice transactions to five or three days, public opinion has consistently urged that this is the only way to calm rice prices. As of yesterday, the Market Management Committee adopted this opinion, and because rice prices rose again yesterday, breaking records and causing alarm, the Market Management Committee held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss measures to control rice prices. It was decided that the delivery date for goods transacted in the market would be limited to three days, and no checks could be returned. This will be strictly enforced starting today.

Emergency Measures by the Management Committee

The Rice Market Management Committee, concerned that the soaring rice prices are not only affecting the livelihood of citizens but also hindering the business of fellow merchants, held its 55th meeting at the Qinglian Pavilion Public Sample Office on Fuzhou Road yesterday afternoon. The attendees included Fu Qian'geng, Zhang Lizhong, Cai Shengming, Lu Zhaofang, Zheng Shengyun, Zhong Xusheng, Gu Yisheng, Hu Wen'an, Yin Fuxiang, Ye Pinshan, Yang Shaoyuan, Xu Yesun, Zhou Zhizhen, and Wang Tianchou. Chairman Fu Qian'geng reported, stating briefly that the soaring rice prices in recent days are unreasonable. If measures are not taken to remedy the situation, the consequences will be dire. He hoped that the committee members would share their opinions and find ways to remedy the situation. The committee members unanimously agreed that the key to stabilizing rice prices was to stop speculative buying and selling. It was then decided that the delivery period for all goods would be limited to three days, effective from today.

Regulations Issued in a Public Notice

After passing the resolution yesterday, the Management Committee immediately issued a public notice, which stated the following: "The market transactions of this association, domestic rice have always been spot transactions, without any standard for the date. The stipulated ten-day deadline refers to foreign rice and Keqian rice. However, at this time of market chaos, the delivery of goods after the transaction is temporarily limited to three days. Whether it is wholesale or retail, or between merchants, all must abide by the scope of their business, only allowing actual transactions and prohibiting speculative buying and selling. Once a transaction is completed, the prescribed form must be used for it to be a formal transaction. If there is a breach of contract after the deadline, each party must submit the transaction certificate to facilitate the disposal of the management office. The penalties will be: for minor violations, suspension of business; for major violations, revocation of membership by the General Association. The same applies to customers, and the relevant customer associations will handle the matter accordingly. Those who do not operate in accordance with the above regulations will be treated as illegal transactions and will be dealt with as violations. The above temporary measures were decided by the 55th Market Management Committee on December 8 and will be implemented from the 9th. Transactions on the market before the 9th will be settled according to the previous regulations. This is a public announcement recorded by both houses. It is hoped that everyone will abide by it."

Sources May be Smooth Next Year

Rising rice prices and the inability to ensure smooth delivery are also contributing factors. However, the amount of rice arriving in Shanghai daily by land and water routes recently is in the range of six to seven thousand packages. The ordered tribute rice is also arriving in Shanghai every other day at a rate of ten to twenty thousand packages. In theory, rice prices should not rise further. The fact that they are going in the opposite direction is truly unexpected. A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency learned that starting from January of next year, there will be no restrictions on Shanghai merchants and firms going to the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to purchase rice for consumption. They can transport it out as much as possible. However, the news may change in an instant.

The Municipal Federation Requests the Maintenance of People's Food Supply

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation believes that the common people suffer the most direct harm from the soaring rice prices. Not only has the food supply within the boundary become a source of panic, but the security of the concessions has also been greatly affected. Some time ago, they suggested to the authorities of the two concessions that they send personnel to purchase as much rice as possible from the producing areas during the new grain season, transport it to Shanghai, set up warehouses for storage, and be prepared to regulate the market for the benefit of the people's livelihood. Although the authorities of the two concessions sympathized with this suggestion, they have not been able to implement it, which is regrettable. Because the rice market has become increasingly chaotic in recent days and it has become even more difficult for the common people to make a living, they appealed again to the authorities of the two concessions yesterday, urging them to quickly devise effective measures to suppress rice prices so that both security and the people's food supply can benefit together. This is urgently necessary.

Severe Punishment for Violations by Grain Measurers

Previously, the Bean and Rice Industry Association stipulated that grain measurers should deduct one cent per stone, of which seven millimeters are for the labor of the grain measurers in the industry, and the remaining three millimeters are for the relief fund for unemployed grain measurers. However, recently, some grain measurers in the industry have gone to various rice shops to collect the three millimeters of relief fund for unemployed grain measurers, and sometimes deduct one and a half millimeters. Yesterday, a certain unemployed grain measurer went to the rice market to collect grain measuring fees from fellow rice merchants and was stopped by a grain measurer in the industry, almost leading to violence, but was eventually dissuaded by fellow merchants. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council's supervisor stationed in the rice market and the Market Management Committee are paying close attention to grain measurers in the industry who violate the association's resolutions. If such behavior is discovered again, they will be severely punished.

### Japan Seizes Control of the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, Japanese Nationals to Assume the Roles of Chief Engineer and Others, Japan Also Retains the Right to Use Dredgers

The dredging project on the Whangpoo River, which has been suspended for more than two years, will soon resume work due to an agreement reached between Japan and the Whangpoo Conservancy Board. Last night, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy announced at a press briefing that, "After six months of negotiations on the resumption of the Whangpoo River project, an agreement was reached on December 1 between the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura Yoshiaki, and the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, after overcoming the difficult hurdle of who will manage the Whangpoo Conservancy Board in the future. Thereafter, the chief engineer and other important positions in the board will be held by Japanese personnel. The existing Chinese personnel of the board will not be transferred. However, Li Jiannan, the 'Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs,' will join the staff. The Japanese Army and Navy will retain the right to use some of the dredgers belonging to the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, including the largest dredger, Jianhua." A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency visited foreign diplomatic circles here to solicit their opinions. According to them, "The reorganization of the Shanghai Whangpoo Conservancy Board is just another move by the Japanese to seize control of Shanghai's hegemony." According to well-informed sources in the shipping industry, "During the 'August 13th' Incident, the Japanese seized the dredgers as 'war spoils.' After the end of the Battle of Shanghai, the Japanese refused to resume dredging work on the pretext of military operations, allowing the Whangpoo River to gradually silt up. The dredgers seized by the Japanese were sent to the channels used exclusively by Japanese ships to dredge silt. Today, the Japanese say that they must retain the right to use the dredgers in order to continue to facilitate Japanese ships in the inland rivers."

### Changes in Rates for Domestic Parcel Delivery

The Directorate General of Posts has repeatedly issued orders to change the rates for domestic parcel delivery. Due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the cost of postal vehicles, and the increase in transportation costs for rented commercial vehicles, the Shanghai Postal Administration has been ordered to compile a temporary surcharge schedule for domestic parcels. The delivery fees for small packages have also been revised. The reporter has learned the revised prices, which are listed below:

Temporary Surcharge for Domestic Parcels

The fees for mutual delivery between the Shanghai Post Office and domestic offices, for shipments to Guangzhou, Shantou, Haikou, Xiamen, Hangzhou, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Beihai, Jiujiang, Hankou, and their subordinate offices, will be subject to a surcharge of five cents per kilogram in addition to the original parcel fee.

The surcharges for the above four regions of Sichuan, East Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan will be the same regardless of whether they are delivered via Annam or any domestic postal route. However, for shipments to Guizhou, in addition to the original fee, if it is noted that a parcel is being transferred via Hunan, the fee for the transfer will be charged according to the rate for the transit point.

The parcel fees for the above-mentioned places include the temporary surcharge, but do not include the surcharge listed in the changed price list of the parcel fee schedule. An additional 20 cents will be charged per package for parcels that are not transferred via "Annam" (30 cents for shipments to Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang). If the package is transferred via Annam, an additional 1 yuan will be charged per package. If there is any discrepancy in the postage, you can call or write to the Business Office of the Shanghai Postal Administration.

Fees for Small Packages

For small packages that are delivered locally, the postage is 10 cents for every 100 cubic centimeters or any fraction thereof. For packages that are mutually delivered between offices, such as those sent from Shanghai to Beiping, Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Beihai, Haikou, Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Hangzhou, and their affiliated offices, Jiujiang and Hankou and their affiliated offices, the postage is 40 cents for every 100 cubic centimeters or any fraction thereof.

The above tables will be implemented immediately.

### Two Arrested Chinese Detectives Expected to be Released Soon, Meeting with the Two Chinese Detectives Possible Next Tuesday, No Confirmed Report on Details of Discussions with the Bureau

Two Chinese detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department were arrested by the Gendarmerie on the afternoon of the 19th of last month while performing routine duties at the intersection of Robison Road and Pinlang Road, together with a Western police chief, Aigbuo, and a female inspector. With the exception of Aigbuo and the female inspector, who were released after being detained for five hours, there has been no news of the release of the two Chinese detectives. It was said that the "Shanghai West Court" had sentenced them, but the Police Department immediately denied this. According to sources, the two arrested Chinese detectives are expected to be released soon. The Police Bureau may meet with the two arrested Chinese detectives on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.

Yesterday was the second anniversary of the passing of the former Envoy of the Western Frontier, the Panchen Lama. The Shanghai Bodhi Society held a public memorial service yesterday afternoon. The Preparatory Office of the Panchen Temple also made the bronze statue of the Master available for public viewing and presented bronze badges as souvenirs. Details are as follows:

Solemn and Grand Public Memorial Ceremony

The Shanghai Bodhi Society was organized by celebrities Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Guan Jiongzhi, and others, with the aim of promoting Buddhism. To commemorate the second anniversary of the passing of the Panchen Lama, the society held a public memorial service at the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant on Parker Road at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. Those who attended included Wen Lanting, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Feng Yangshan, Tao Fuqing, Rosang Yixi Ze, Yuan Chen of the Jade Buddha Temple, and more than 30 others. The ceremony hall was located on the second floor of Gongdelin. A portrait of the Master was placed on the offering table, surrounded by colorful arches made of flowers. Twelve items such as fresh vegetables and sweets were placed in the center. Incense was burned, candles were lit, and the arrangement was simple and neat. The ceremony began at 11:30 a.m. First, the chief celebrant, Wen Lanting, and the assistant celebrants, Guan Jiongzhi and Huang Hanzhi, performed a solemn ceremony. Then, they took turns to worship. After the ceremony, they had a meal together.

Bronze Statue of the Panchen Lama on Public View

Rosang Qingpi, the great disciple of the Panchen Lama and the founder of the Mongolian-Tibetan Institute, previously invited various Dharma protectors in Shanghai to cast a bronze statue of the Master, which was completed on Buddha's Birthday this year. Yesterday, he brought the statue to be enshrined in the Preparatory Office of the Panchen Temple at No. 5 Shuanghe Village, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Bayle, welcoming people from all walks of life to pay their respects and presenting a bronze bell-shaped commemorative medal. Wen Lanting, Zhang Xiaolin, Tao Fuqing, Rongzeng Kanbu, Rosang Yixi Ze, and others went to pay their respects. According to Rosang Qingpi, the bronze statue of the Panchen Lama was originally intended to be placed in a temple to be built on Mount Putuo, but this was suspended due to environmental restrictions. Currently, celebrities in Shanghai are planning to find a place to house it. He also mentioned that the Mongolian-Tibetan Institute has more than 200 students, mostly from the border areas. More than 40 students have graduated from the institute, all of whom are proficient in Tibetan language and writing. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, all of them have gone to the border areas to assist the government in their service.

### Ge Shulin Shot at at the Intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Avenue Foch, Assassin Fires Two Shots in a Row, Both Missing, Detective Chases Assassin, Captured After Being Shot, Stray Bullet Kills and Injures Five People in Total

At 9:50 a.m. yesterday, a shooting occurred at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Avenue Foch, on the border of the British and French Concessions. Ge Shusen, a Hebei native who had previously served as a police officer but has now changed his name and is acting as a puppet official, was the target of an assassination. Ge was fortunate to escape injury as he dodged very quickly at the time. However, when a detective chased after the assailant, five pedestrians were injured by stray bullets, and two died of their injuries. The shooter was also arrested. The details are as follows:

Attempted Harm

At around 9:40 a.m. yesterday, Ge Shusen left his residence at No. 4 Siming Village on Avenue Foch and walked to the intersection of Avenue Foch and Rue Cardinal Mercier, intending to take a bus there. Just as he arrived at the bus stop, a young man suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, pulled out a Mauser pistol, and shot at Ge. Because of his current "position," Ge had been prepared at all times, so when he saw someone trying to harm him, he quickly dodged.

Assassin Hit

At that time, the young man was firing his Mauser pistol at Ge, firing two shots in quick succession, while shouting "Get out of the way!" Ge, at this critical moment of life and death, had already run to No. 939 to take cover. Seeing the tense situation, the young man attempted to follow and pursue him. At that moment, two Western police officers were patrolling from east to west on motorcycles. When they reached the entrance of Siming Lane, they suddenly heard gunshots and followed the sound. They saw the assassin walking west to east along the wall of the Rue Cardinal Mercier Garden, facing the detective. The two Western police officers immediately fired their pistols at the assassin, and two Chinese detectives had also arrived after hearing the gunshots. At that time, there were many pedestrians on the road, so the Western police officers chased the assassin along the road, all the way to the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Avenue Foch. There were fewer pedestrians there, so the two Western police officers fired their guns to order him to stop. The Chinese detectives also assisted in the chase. The assassin was unable to resist and was shot and fell at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Avenue Foch.

Frightened Escape

Ge Shusen was wearing a coat with an otter collar yesterday. After hearing the gunshots, he quickly dodged, escaping injury. It is reported that Ge is already in his fifties, from Hebei Province, and has a tall stature. He once served as an inspector in the City Public Security Bureau. After the Sino-Japanese War, Ge changed his name to Zhang and became a "Captain" in the puppet "Public Security Bureau," usually serving in western Shanghai. Yesterday morning, he left his residence, and it is said that he was also going there on business. When the assassin fired at Ge, Ge pretended to fall to the ground and then crawled to No. 939. Therefore, both bullets hit the wall there. In a state of fright, Ge fled down Weihaiwei Road while the Western police officers were chasing the assassin.

Two Dead, Three Injured

When the Western police officers chased the assassin, the assassin was hit in the hail of bullets, with two bullets hitting his head. He immediately fell to the ground. At that time, five pedestrians near the Zhirenyong Girls' School were injured by stray bullets. Those who have been identified are: (1) Zhang Asi (28 years old, from Haimen, residing at No. 30 Cihou South Lane, Rue Cardinal Mercier), injured in the left foot, sent to the Red Cross Hospital; (2) rickshaw puller Gu Xingshi (42 years old, from Jiangbei), injured in the right leg; (3) Pan Zhihai, a worker at the Pacific Coal Store on Weihaiwei Road (35 years old, from Ningbo), injured in the right foot; (4) a passing begging monk, injured in the left chest, sent to the Police Bao and Long Hospitals for treatment; (5) an unknown man resembling a coolie, shot in the lower jaw, died upon arrival at the hospital. The begging monk was shot in the front of the brain and also died shortly after. The young assassin was wearing a herringbone wool coat. It is said that after being injured, he claimed his name was Wang Sanxiao, but the details are still awaiting a thorough investigation by the police.

### All Employees of the Second Special Court Petition for a Salary Increase, Expected to be Resolved Satisfactorily Within Days

Since Chen Maoxian took office as the president of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, not a single official or employee in the entire court has been transferred. Therefore, all officials and employees are working hard. However, at a time when rice prices are soaring, dozens of employees of the court, because of their low positions and low salaries, are unable to make a living, and they jointly petitioned the chief of the general affairs section to submit their petition to President Chen, requesting him to take into consideration their situation and make appropriate salary adjustments. It is reported that this matter will be resolved satisfactorily within days. It is reported that the No. 3 High Branch Court, in view of the extremely high cost of living at present, has followed the example of the No. 2 High Branch Court and the No. 1 Special District Court in the British Concession and has appropriately increased the salaries of guards and other employees, or has provided temporary subsidies and restored the previous bonus system, in order to maintain their current livelihoods until the situation recovers.

### "Bad Land" Becomes a Den of Iniquity; Bandits Run Rampant in Broad Daylight; Robberies and Thefts Emerge One After Another; A Meeting to Share Money Turns to Handguns

After the policing authority of the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads Office was encroached upon by the Japanese puppet regime, the influence of evil forces gradually expanded, creating today's "bad land," a den of iniquity. Since the beginning of winter, gangsters have been running rampant in broad daylight in the "bad land" area, and robberies have emerged one after another. The security situation there has fallen into a state of utter disrepair.

Doctor Encounters Robbery on His Way Home from Diagnosing Patients

Yesterday around 11:00 a.m., a doctor from the Chinese Medical Association, accompanied by a female nurse, went to the Third Refugee Shelter of the Tzu Lien Branch at 93 Rue Béliard (a residence once occupied by the puppet "Self-Defense Corps") to treat refugees. When they were about to return after finishing their work, they were suddenly stopped by "gangsters" just as they stepped out of the gate. The gangsters threatened them with guns, forcibly took the doctor's overcoat and the nurse's gold ring, and then fled without a trace. The doctor and nurse suffered this loss and could only lament in vain.

Sweet Potato Boat Owner Robbed of Proceeds

The second incident of "gangster" robbery and violence yesterday occurred near the Place de l'Etoile on Route Ghisi. Around 10:00 a.m., several sweet potato boats were docked in the Suzhou Creek. After the boat owner went ashore and sold the sweet potatoes to a local merchant, he obtained more than 800 yuan. Upon returning to the boat, he was suddenly followed by "gangsters" who used violent means to rob him of all the money. Afterward, the boat owner burst into tears, which moved the onlookers to sorrow.

Famous Rabbits Stolen from Shanghai Rabbit Farm

Around 11:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Luh Chia Road Hai Qi Rabbit Farm, located in the Extra-Settlement Roads area, reported a sudden theft of twenty-one pairs of rabbits. The farm raises more than two hundred pairs of famous European and American breeds such as Angora, Bleu de Vienne, and Blanc de Hotot, all of which are extremely valuable. Therefore, the estimated loss is over a thousand yuan. The rabbit thieves climbed over the wall from outside the farm. Footprints were found on the walls of the farm and the neighboring gardens. The farm is currently investigating the case.

Meeting to Share Money Turns to Pointing Guns

Yesterday around 3:00 p.m., four "diners," all dressed in plain clothes and looking quite wealthy, suddenly arrived at a restaurant in Tsao Chia Du. The manager immediately greeted them attentively. After the diners were seated, they each ordered their favorite dishes and devoured them voraciously. When it came time to pay the bill, which totaled 25.40 yuan, they initially argued about who would pay, then looked at each other blankly. Finally, one of them drew a handgun and declared to the manager, "It's inconvenient today; we'll settle it the day after tomorrow." With that, they brazenly left.

### Shanghai Telephone Company Transfers Company Assets; New Company Registered in the United States; Shareholders Exchange Old Shares for New Shares; Number of Shares in Old and New Companies Equivalent

Regarding the transfer of assets and exchange of old shares for new shares by the Shanghai Telephone Company, a special announcement was released yesterday stating: "To the Shareholders of Shanghai Telephone Company, Greetings. The Board of Directors of the Company, in a meeting held in New York State, USA, on December 6, 1939, resolved to issue a dividend to each shareholder of Shanghai General Currency 60 cents per share, to be issued in Shanghai on December 27, according to the names of the shareholders registered as of 5:00 p.m. on December 15. A special shareholders' meeting was held in New York on November 22, 1939, regarding this matter, and the Company previously issued a notice on October 10 of the same year, which was mailed to each shareholder on record.

Deadline for Share Transfers

All matters regarding the sale of the Company's assets to Shanghai Telephone Company (registered in the United States) and the dissolution of the Company have been approved. The Company's Board of Directors, therefore, decided to hold a meeting in New York on December 6 of the same year to close all of the Company's transfer books on December 15 of the same year. Only shareholders registered will have the right to receive liquidation distribution from the Company. This liquidation distribution is in the form of shares of Shanghai Telephone Company (registered in the United States), which will be issued to the shareholders of Shanghai Telephone Company on a one-for-one basis. As for the market value, the shares of the two companies are the same, namely Shanghai General Currency 10 yuan per share. The number of new shares of Shanghai Telephone Company (registered in the United States) will be equal to the number of shares held by each shareholder registered as of December 15, 1939, and will be distributed on December 27. Thereafter, this Company will be dissolved. However, because the final date for Company share transfers is December 15, and the liquidation distribution and shares of Shanghai Telephone Company (registered in the United States) will be issued to the shareholders registered on that date,

Shareholders Should Register Promptly

Therefore, all true holders of shares, or designated trustees, should come to register immediately. All true holders of shares, or designated trustees, must exchange their old shares for the new shares under the aforementioned names by 5:00 p.m. on November 15, 1939. Therefore, when the Company distributes the liquidation distribution on December 27, 1939, it will only recognize the shareholders registered before 5:00 p.m. on December 15, 1939, and will distribute the new shares to them. After December 15, 1939, the Company's shares will be invalid and should be discarded."

### The Mystery of the Missing Girl; No Trace After Extensive Investigation; Female Worker Yin Wang is a Prime Suspect

Yin Wang, a woman from Taixing (age 20), is a female worker at the Shen Xin No. 6 Cotton Mill. She lives in the factory dormitory at No. 140 Route Pottier. On the afternoon of the 22nd of last month, two Taixing girls living in the same dormitory, Yang Hongying (age 15) and Qu Yindi (age 16),

Suddenly Disappeared

The two girls usually ate meals at the home of their fellow townsman, Wang Zhuang. They have not returned since. Wang Zhuang asked Yin Wang about the situation, but Yin Wang's answers were evasive. Wang Zhuang reported this information to the Putuo Road Police Station. The police dispatched detectives to bring Yin Wang to the police station. Under investigation, Yin Wang stated that she had recently gone to visit Lu Xiaolin, a young woman at No. 1268 Route Robert, Zhabei, with the two girls, and had also gone to Dr. Chen Shaoliang's clinic at No. 1088 Tsao Chia Du for medical treatment. The rest of her statements were

Very Vague

And her demeanor was flustered. She was sent to the First Special District Court. As to where the two girls were, she claimed not to know. She was sent back to detention for further investigation. Yang and Qu have not been found, and there are no clues to be found. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng came to the Third Criminal Court for continued trial. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the process, and then the woman who cooked meals, Wang Zhuang, testified, "At that time, I sternly questioned her about the disappearance of Yang and Qu. She admitted that she could find them." When questioned about the statements Yin Wang made at the police station and what she had said to Wang Zhuang,

She Completely Denied Everything

And insisted that she did not know anything about the disappearance of the two girls, where they had gone, or whether they would return. She cried out for injustice and begged for leniency. Police lawyer Li rose and stated that Yin Wang was very much related to the disappearance of the two girls. She had previously said that the two girls had gone to Lu Xiaolin's residence at No. 1268 Route Robert. The police dispatched detectives to investigate Lu Xiaolin, but there was no such person. Her words were not reliable. The court ordered a further postponement and ordered that Chen Yisheng be summoned to court to testify and verify the facts.

### Woman Wang Yuee Flees with Japanese Currency; Her Paramour Also Implicated and Imprisoned

Wang Yuee, a woman from Hai Ning who worked as a maid for a Japanese man named Miyoshi, residing at No. 24 Dade Li, North Szechuan Road, on the morning of the 6th of this month, took advantage of her employer's inattention and stole 1,150 Japanese yen from a clothing chest. She fled to No. 3 Tonglin Li, Mingde Road, Zhabei, and gave the money to her paramour, Dong Futang, to exchange for legal tender, intending to escape back to their hometown together. Yesterday afternoon, they carried the money into the Public Settlement to purchase jewelry and were arrested by Chinese detective Peng Bingsheng of the Central Police Station. 1,100 yuan in legal tender, a watch, and a gold ring were found on their persons. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Dai concluded the trial and sentenced Wang Yuee to six months in prison for theft and Dong Futang to three months in prison for receiving stolen goods. The stolen jewelry and cash were returned to the owner.

### Guard Sells Drugs; Testimonies Shirk Responsibility; Court Orders Conclusion of Trial and Awaits Judgment

Li Han and Tu Kun, two guards at the Shanghai Second Special District Prison on Route Massenet in the French Concession, jointly invested in selling drugs such as morphine and cigarettes outside the prison in September of this year. They handed them over to inmate Jin Mingquan to resell to fellow inmates. On the 27th of the same month, the warden discovered this, found the evidence, and reported it to the supervisory department. The two guards, Li and Tu, along with the inmate Jin, were transferred to the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court for investigation and prosecution. During the investigation, guard Tu Kun absconded after posting bail, fearing punishment for a false charge. The prosecutor repeatedly opened court sessions to investigate and also summoned fellow inmates Shi Genquan, Xiong Dequan, Chen Asan, Li Zhiming, and Qian Xingsheng to testify and prove the facts. The investigation was declared over, and the two guards, Li and Tu, and the inmate Jin Mingquan, were indicted for malfeasance and other crimes in the criminal court of the same level. An arrest warrant was issued for the fugitive Tu Kun. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Sun Pengxian and the prosecutor opened a court session for the trial. Li Han denied selling drugs and cigarettes and claimed to be unaware of the matter. Jin Mingquan completely shifted the blame onto the fugitive guard Tu Kun. The two defendants appointed lawyers Wei Weiqing and Wang Hengyi to defend them. The court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the sentencing date. Defendant Li Han was released on his original bail, and Jin Mingquan was sent back to prison.

### Attempting to Cross the Security Line; Chinese Arrested

The junction of Huisi, Hongkou, North Jiangxi Road, and Haining Road is the entrance and exit of the Japanese military security line. In recent days, the situation at this entrance and exit has become tense again. All persons entering and exiting are subject to strict inspection. Around 8:45 p.m. yesterday, a Chinese man, about thirty years old, was loitering at the entrance and exit, seeming to want to pass through the area and enter Inner Hongkou, but also seeming not to have a pass and daring not to move forward. He was thus in a dilemma, deep in thought. Unexpectedly, his behavior aroused the suspicion of a Japanese sentry, who walked to the edge of the security line and questioned him sternly. The man panicked and did not speak Japanese, so he could not answer. He turned around and retreated into the area guarded by the concession police, but this caused a misunderstanding. The Japanese sentry immediately fired a shot at him with his weapon, but fortunately missed. The sentry then tried to take the man away. The police officers on duty at the scene immediately reported the situation to the police station, and Japanese police officers were dispatched to investigate. After questioning the man, it was learned that he did indeed want to go to Hongkou, but had not obtained a pass and was therefore hesitant at the security line, leading to the misunderstanding. After obtaining a statement, the police station ordered detectives to investigate the man's occupation and address in order to decide what to do with him.

### Chen Weida, Owner of the Weida Hotel, Accused of Obstruction of Freedom

Gu Yuesheng, a native of Nanhui and owner of the Gu Yueji Construction Factory at No. 297 Route Ladu in the French Concession, recently engaged lawyer Hu Fengtu to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District against Chen Weida, owner of the Weida Hotel on Avenue Joffre, accusing him of using violence and coercion to obstruct public works and requesting an investigation according to Article 304 of the Criminal Code, and requesting the right to prosecute him civilly, and retaining the right to pursue damages. According to the complaint, the plaintiff contracted with the defendant in May of this year to build a house at No. 392 on the land register of the French Municipal Council on Rue Laugier, with payments to be made in installments, and a contract was signed. By October, eight installments had been paid, but 3,000 yuan remained unpaid, and the increased construction costs were also withheld. In November, the defendant suddenly engaged a lawyer to send a letter of warning, terminating the contract. The plaintiff was forced to engage a lawyer to reply according to law and to negotiate a settlement, but the defendant had no sincerity, so it was unsuccessful. On the 27th of the same month, the defendant led the secretary of the court, police officers, and clerks to expel the workers guarding the site and began construction without authorization. On the 30th, the plaintiff and his lawyer went to the site to take photographs to present as evidence, but they were again obstructed. The plaintiff's actions clearly constitute obstruction of the freedom of others and the exercise of their rights. Therefore, the plaintiff requested that the defendant be punished according to the law. The court accepted the complaint, and Judge Jiang Liquan came to the Criminal Court yesterday to summon the parties. The plaintiff and his lawyer appeared in court and explained the case. The defendant also appeared in court with his defense lawyer and stated that the plaintiff had made unreasonable demands, using the pretext of joint discussion of conditions to force an increase of 30% in costs, so the contract was terminated. After reviewing the statements, the court ordered a debate, declared that the facts of the case were clear, and scheduled the judgment for the 15th of this month.

### Impersonating a Teacher; Scamming Parents

Mrs. Cai Yao, who lives at No. 61 Mantiangfang Street, Wuma Road, was visited by a woman of about thirty years old last Sunday afternoon, who claimed to be named Zhang. She greeted the Cai family and said that she was a teacher at Yao's alma mater. Yao was out, and the family, seeing that she was Yao's teacher, entertained her cordially. The woman was eloquent. When she was about to leave, she suddenly said that she had rushed out in a hurry and had forgotten to bring her purse. She said that her aunt was in Hong Kong and had an important matter to telegraph, but she had not brought any money. If she went back to get it, she was afraid that she would not have enough time and would not be able to send the telegram today, so she ventured to borrow a dozen yuan and would return it immediately tomorrow. The Cai family lent her fifteen yuan. The woman left unhurriedly. After a while, Cai Yao returned home and learned what had happened. She knew that she had been deceived, but there was no way to get the money back. It is feared that this kind of scam has victimized more than just the Cai family. Parents in this city are advised to be careful.

### Local Opium Dealer Arrested and Sentenced

Sixty-five taels of opium and fifty-five yuan in cash with secret marks were seized. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court and charged with selling drugs. Judge Feng presided over the trial and sentenced them to the appropriate penalties. The evidence was confiscated.

### Case of American Beaten by Japanese Military Police; U.S. Considers Action; Whether to Protest to the Japanese Depends on the Fleet Commander's Decision

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that regarding the case of the beating of Russell, an employee of the U.S. Naval Purchasing Office in Shanghai, by Japanese military police on Wednesday morning, the U.S. authorities will protest to the Japanese authorities if Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol Fleet, decides to do so. However, since the admiral left Shanghai on the U.S. ship Luzon yesterday morning, he will not return until next week.

Before he returns

, any protest will not occur within a few days. The admiral is fully aware of the situation and will be able to investigate the matter before he returns to Shanghai. According to reports, at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday morning, an American boat docked at Pier No. 4 in Pudong, carrying items to be loaded onto the U.S. ship Luzon. A

Japanese military police

Officer from Taiwan boarded the boat to inspect it. A U.S. Navy sentry guarding the goods ordered him to leave the boat immediately. At that time, Russell also arrived on the scene and ordered the Japanese to leave immediately. The Japanese refused and punched Russell. Russell then forcibly made the Japanese disembark. Municipal Council Inspector Harper happened to be on the shore. At that time, the

Director of the U.S. Naval Purchasing Office, Chuan Chu,

And Municipal Council Deputy Director-General Robertson, after receiving a phone call, rushed to the scene one after another. After asking the Japanese about everything, they released him. According to the Japanese military authorities yesterday, the case is expected to be resolved peacefully.

### Grain; Foreign Rice Arrives Daily; Rice Prices Rise Daily; If There Is No Way to Sanction Manipulation; It Is Unlikely That Rice Prices Will Fall

This time, rice prices have risen again due to the impact of the "control" of the source of supply in the mainland. The source of supply suddenly became scarce, leading to consecutive days of skyrocketing prices, breaking the 40 yuan mark directly. Ordinary粳 rice has even reached 45-46 yuan. In just a few days, whether it is 粳 or 尖 rice, all have soared by as much as 6-7 yuan. Judging by the rising trend, if there is no hope of unblocking the source of supply, and if there is no way to sanction manipulation, it is unlikely that rice prices will fall. The rice industry is only engaged in promoting the implementation of industry regulations, all kinds of arguments, nothing more than to shirk responsibility. They are familiar with making cocoons, and hoarding and manipulating as before. Yesterday, the sources of supply from various roads arrived in the Sujia area with 13 or 14 cars of goods, and 2 or 3 ships of Qingjiao goods from Hexia. When the market opened in the morning, all the brokers rushed to inquire, following the aftereffects of the previous day. The sellers hoarded and refused to release their goods, and rice prices rose steadily. Ordinary 粳 rice once reached 47-48 yuan, 昆粳 rice also reached 46-47 yuan, 簿稻 rice reached 44 yuan, and 芦羊尖 rice reached 42-43 yuan, all of which increased sharply by 2-3 yuan compared to the previous market. Although prices have risen, it is ultimately felt that the huge price of nearly 50 yuan will inevitably be difficult to sell in the future, and the brokers also feel it is difficult to handle, so they stopped buying. Those who bought in the past then sold at a high price, and the supply was greater than the demand, so the prices of various goods fell step by step by about 1-2 yuan. At the close of the market, ordinary 粳 rice was 46.5 yuan, 昆粳 rice was 45.5 yuan, and 簿稻 rice was 42-43 yuan, an increase of about half a yuan to nearly a yuan compared to the previous market.

The source of 籼 rice is gradually increasing. Although there are delays en route and cumbersome procedures, the vendors transport a lot of it because of its high profits. In the future, it should arrive in port continuously. However, due to the influence of the sharp rise in 粳 rice and the heat of speculation yesterday morning, the price once rose by one yuan, but due to the foreign rice pressing down, the market then fell back, resulting in only a gain of half a yuan. High 无籼 rice was opened at 39 yuan.

Orders for foreign rice continue to be negotiated. The Grain Merchants Association sent out a telegram with a price of 43-44 yuan, but the foreign merchants said that the telegram price had risen and that they would only discuss it at 48-49 yuan. Therefore, no formal agreement has been reached on the new transaction. Currently, in the early market in Saigon, merchants rarely show samples. Only general returning goods are traded with each other. The market fluctuated by only one yuan. The initial price of short-grain rice was 39 yuan, 38.8 yuan, and the closing price was 38.5 yuan. The initial price of long-grain rice was 38.5 yuan, and the closing price was 38.2 yuan, 37.9 yuan, an increase of only 3-4 cents to half a yuan.

Foreign rice arrives one after another. Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Yong Sheng ship brought 12,923 bags from Hong Kong, and the Taikoo Co.'s Taiyuan ship brought 13,134 bags from Hong Kong, a total of 26,057 bags, which are being unloaded. (Zu)

### Factories Release Stock, Receive Wheat; Qingdao Uses Oil to Exchange for Flour

After flour mill disks experienced another surge the day before yesterday, they have gradually become more stable. It is observed that wheat raw materials have seen repeated high prices recently. Due to rising costs, each factory insists on its selling price. However, aside from South Asia, where sales are still good, others find the price too high and cannot afford to purchase. Moreover, places like Qingdao find transportation unprofitable. However, since the Japanese have taken control of peanut oil, only Qingdao and similar places can export small quantities. Even then, they must exchange equivalent goods for exports. This is why some can only exchange oil for flour, thus providing a small outlet for flour. Other places like Tianjin and Qinhuangdao do not have strong demand. Although some is transported there, it is not comparable to the past, as it has long become a Japanese flour market. Therefore, customer sales are not as enthusiastic as in the past few days. The total transaction volume is estimated at over 30,000 bags, with local and external customers each accounting for half. Second-grade flour continues to open at eight yuan and three jiao for the original disk, while return-cargo train flour still requires eight yuan and six jiao. Japanese factory Phoenix brand flour opened at eight yuan and three jiao for December initially, but quickly dropped to one yuan, seven or eight fen. Recycled Dragon Gate brand flour opened at seven yuan, seven jiao and a half. The market situation seems weak. Furthermore, 7,500 bags of flour are being shipped to Tianjin, and another 5,500 bags are being shipped to Hong Kong.

The wheat market situation has become expensive again, as factories have implemented a price of thirteen yuan and five jiao to purchase, but the supply remains scarce. As a result, Fuxin only secured 600 bags, and Fufeng only opened 300 bags. Wheat from Suzhou, Changzhou, Yangzhou, and other places is all opening at thirteen yuan and five jiao. The market offerings include ten cartloads of Guandian wheat and Bengbu Hua wheat. The highest price is thirteen yuan, six jiao and eight fen, setting a new high.

The oil market was relatively calm yesterday, with few transactions. However, the supply source is still not strong, and those hoarding goods are reluctant to release them easily.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Beans Attract Hoarding Interest; Afternoon Sees Another Rebound

The yellow bean market situation saw initial calmness in the morning, as customer sales were stagnant and hoarders were observing. Local vendors had full inventories, leading to market stability. In the afternoon, hoarders from various groups returned to inquire, and beans with dry bodies, high quality, and sales channels to oil factories saw another increase, resulting in a rise of two to three jiao. Currently, the overall situation is that supply and sales are roughly equal. Although the bottom inventory is not thick, the supply source is quite smooth. Yesterday, the total market included six to seven hundred bags of Dingjiazhou beans, priced from seventeen yuan and five jiao to eighteen yuan and two jiao and a half; four cartloads of Nanjing beans, priced from sixteen yuan and eight jiao to seventeen yuan, three jiao and a half; over five hundred bags of Wuhu beans, priced at sixteen yuan, eight or nine jiao; three cartloads of Bengbu beans, priced at eighteen yuan to eighteen yuan, three jiao; over six hundred bags of Chongming sand yellow, priced at seventeen yuan, seven jiao to eighteen yuan and two fen; and fifty bags of Pinghu Du beans, priced at eighteen yuan, seven jiao and a half.

On the 9th, 5,968 bags of beans, 980 bags of raw kernels, 2,785 barrels of raw oil, and 560 cans of sesame oil were shipped to Hong Kong. Also, on the 8th, 600 cans of leather oil were shipped from Ningbo.

### Finance: Gold Market Bulls Take Profits

The cash "cooked red" gray market situation yesterday was slightly calmer due to the stabilization of the foreign exchange market. However, a certain money exchange business, which had been consistently buying in the past few days, came to take profits, with a volume of over a thousand taels. Despite small declines, the bulls continued to add positions from time to time. As a result, it only fell by ten yuan. The future may have temporary fluctuations, but there is no risk of a complete collapse. Looking at the day's proceedings, the morning opened unchanged at four thousand one hundred and eighty yuan. It then rose by five yuan. Subsequently, due to a certain money exchange business continuously selling on behalf of large clients to take profits, and the foreign exchange market being firm at the time, although securities firms and other groups had demand, it was ultimately overwhelmed by selling pressure. It once retreated to a low price of four thousand one hundred and thirty yuan. Fortunately, the foreign exchange market softened, and it was heard that HSBC was buying, triggering a buying frenzy. Certain gold shops and retail investors entered the market to compete for sales, so it once reached four thousand one hundred and ninety yuan. However, the good times did not last. At noon, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and the buyers who had rushed in to take advantage of the situation quickly returned to selling. By the time of the noon close, it only reported four thousand one hundred and seventy yuan. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market was stagnant, and the fluctuations were extremely flat. As a result, it was similar to the noon close. Trading was brisk throughout the day, at two thousand seven to eight hundred taels. Jewelry shops discounted small five yuan, and customs gold remained flat.

"Cooked red" falls back ten yuan

From the morning opening, each bar (ten taels) initially opened with a relatively stable situation due to a flat foreign exchange market report. The first transaction was a money exchange business purchasing one tael from a gold shop for four thousand one hundred and eighty yuan, with no change from the previous day. Shortly afterward, securities firms came to buy in slightly, raising it by five yuan and purchasing ten taels from a cash gold shop for four thousand one hundred and eighty-five yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange business sold on behalf of a large client, with a significant amount, and at one point the incoming demand was sluggish, immediately pressing down thirty-five yuan. The money exchange business sold thirty taels to a jewelry shop for four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan. Later, a certain jewelry shop bought on behalf of a client, and the sellers temporarily stopped, so it rebounded by twenty yuan. The money exchange business transacted twenty taels with each other for four thousand one hundred and seventy yuan. After this, a certain money exchange business started selling again, only releasing one hundred taels, and the price had already been pressed down to four thousand one hundred and fifty-five yuan. At that time, another money exchange business's intake turned strong, and securities firms also followed, so it rebounded by twenty yuan, reaching four thousand one hundred and seventy-five yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange business came to sell heavily again, and the foreign exchange market also reported a firm tone, so it fell sharply by forty-five yuan again. The money exchange business sold one tael to a gold shop for four thousand one hundred and thirty yuan. At around eleven o'clock, the foreign exchange market suddenly softened, and buyers rushed in, instantly jumping up eighteen yuan. Later, with the addition of a certain gold shop and securities firms and retail investors competing to buy, it rose by another forty yuan, with the securities firms buying fifty taels from a certain money exchange business and the money exchange businesses transacting twenty taels with each other, all for four thousand one hundred and ninety yuan. At noon, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and the buying frenzy subsided. Generally, many scalpers released their positions at high prices, and at the same time, a certain gold shop also took profits late in the game. Soon it dropped by thirty yuan, with the gold shops transacting ten taels with each other for four thousand one hundred and sixty yuan. When the market was about to close, a certain money exchange business came to shout to buy again, and soon it rose by ten yuan, with the money exchange businesses transacting two taels with each other for four thousand one hundred and seventy yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the initial opening saw the money exchange business continue to raise the price, opening ten yuan higher, with the money exchange business purchasing ten taels from a gold shop for four thousand one hundred and eighty yuan. Later, a certain money exchange business turned to selling intentions and released dozens of taels, and the jewelry shops also slightly sold out, falling by fifteen yuan. The money exchange business sold ten taels to a securities firm for four thousand one hundred and sixty-five yuan. At that time, the securities firms continued to buy in, so it rose again to four thousand one hundred and eighty yuan. Afterward, due to the gold shop and a certain jewelry shop releasing, it fell slightly to four thousand one hundred and sixty yuan. Later, another securities firm entered the market to absorb it, so it rose by five yuan, with the securities firm purchasing twenty taels from a money exchange business for four thousand one hundred and seventy yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell back ten yuan compared to the previous day. The entire day saw fluctuations of sixty yuan. The selling price of cash gold shops' own-brand gold was one yuan higher than "cooked red," and the purchase price was reduced by twenty yuan. The current standard gold was over fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Marked Down Small Five Yuan

The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael was still suspended at four hundred and twenty-five yuan by Datonghang. After ten o'clock, it was marked down by a small five yuan. There were no changes after this. As a result, Datonghang changed its suspension to four hundred and twenty yuan. The new counterparts were at the same price, and the purchase price was reduced by fifteen yuan.

### Exchange Market Lingers; Hong Kong Banks Sell Sterling, Buy Dollars

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The off-market market for sterling and U.S. dollars showed a return to a lingering state, with narrow fluctuations. The process was initially loose, then tight, and finally flat. The morning opening saw sterling slightly loose, at 0.15625, while the dollar remained unchanged, influenced by the 75 point drop in the sterling-dollar exchange rate. The situation was calm after the opening. It was not until after 9:30 that it was heard that Hong Kong Electric was selling sterling and slightly buying dollars, but at that time it was slightly hardening, reaching 4 1/2 points, and 7.3475. Subsequently, HSBC came to absorb it, and Japanese banks and textile merchants followed, so the market suddenly changed and tightened to 4 4375 points and 7.25. At noon, the scalpers were satisfied and returned to flat, so the noon close was similar to the morning opening. The afternoon situation was flat and lifeless. There were no changes until the evening close. Sterling was still at 4 484375 points, and the dollar was still at 7.28125. As a result, sterling was 0.15625 looser than the previous day, while the dollar was unchanged. The trend of futures was no different from the spot.

Textile Merchants Still Settling In

In the early morning, London's dog bars, both near and far terms, contracted by 125. New York silver prices remained flat, London raw gold stagnated, and exchange rates for sterling against the U.S. dollar, Shanghai dollar, and French franc were all flat. The U.S. dollar fell by 75 against the pound, fell by five points against the Shanghai dollar, and fell slightly by 25 against the French franc. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was sterling at 4 484375 points, and the U.S. dollar at 7.28125, with sterling being 0.15625 looser and the U.S. dollar unchanged compared to the previous closing, due to the exchange rate being reported as contracted. The market situation was quiet after the opening, and transactions were rare. When HSBC's listed price was announced and did not move, the silver balancing tax was announced to be slightly lower by one point. After this, Hong Kong Electric suddenly came to sell sterling and slightly buy U.S. dollars, and the head position seemed to be abundant, so it was slightly hard. Hong Kong Electric sold spot sterling at 484375 points and half a point to foreign banks and importers. At the same time, Hong Kong Electric bought spot U.S. dollars at 7.3125 from a certain bank. Later, the U.S. dollar once loosened to 7.34375. Subsequently, HSBC suddenly became interested in buying, which led to Japanese banks and textile merchants buying in, so the situation slightly turned soft. HSBC absorbed spot U.S. dollars at 7.3125 from a certain bank, and this month's sterling at 4 4375 points from a Japanese bank. Following this, textile merchants also settled this month's U.S. dollars at 7.25 with foreign banks. At that time, the spot U.S. dollar also shouted over 7.25. At noon, the scalpers gradually decreased, and the situation suddenly became stable. Extended to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was sterling at 4 484375 points, and the U.S. dollar at 7.28125, with no change compared to the morning opening.

Speculators Slightly Enter Far-Term Contracts

Transactions were extremely rare in the afternoon, and spot sterling and U.S. dollars were rarely traded. It was only heard that speculators Cheng came to buy in foreign banks' January U.S. dollars for 7.1875, and the price also lacked honor or disgrace. Extended to the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was still sterling at 4 484375 points, and the U.S. dollar was also still at 7.28125. This month's sterling was at 4 46875 points, and the U.S. dollar was at 7.25. January sterling was at 4 453125 points, and the U.S. male was at 7.15625.

Yesterday's securities off-market situation was caused by reports that problems had arisen again with the eighth installment of principal and interest due at the end of January next year. Although this was personal speculation and not of great importance, the fragile hearts of the people were inevitably affected slightly. It is still far away, and it is too early to be concerned about such things. Today is the date for the eighth lottery for Class E, so it is necessary to calculate the profit from winning the lottery. The future may not be able to quickly escape the hovering state. The price was still firm yesterday morning, without much fluctuation. Class C was still standing firm outside seven yuan. There was quite a bit of buying in No. 20. The selling atmosphere was more intense in the afternoon. There were more sales of Tiansheng and No. 38, but No. 20 continued to buy. There were also purchases of No. 35 and Tongkang Hengfu. Class C retreated to the seven-yuan mark again. Because of today's lottery, Class E was doing both linked lottery and ex-lottery at two different market prices at the same time yesterday afternoon. The difference in large prize rights was about one yuan. Yesterday's market price resulted in a small five cents, one jiao to four jiao. The volume of transactions was in the range of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.

Stock transactions included thirty shares of the Great China Rubber Factory, priced at sixty-five yuan.

Yesterday's stock market, although the wind of profit-taking was very strong, was not greatly affected. The trend turned lively in the afternoon. Jardine Matheson, Ruiyong, Telephone, Steel Industry, and International Trust stocks accounted for most of the day's trading. The price of telephone stocks fluctuated greatly due to conflicting news, reaching a low of nineteen yuan and four jiao, and then returning to twenty-one yuan and two jiao and a half. There were buyers at this closing price. Interest in rubber stocks increased sharply. Several stocks that had been almost forgotten recently were once again favored. Although the transaction amount was not huge daily, it also included a variety of stocks.

London, 7th Telegram: The listed market prices of Chinese foreign debts remained stable today. There were no changes in the upper and lower gears of each bond. The listed market price of shares of famous British Far East companies, HSBC opened on average and reported a rise. HSBC bank shares rose by half a pound each, with London-registered shares at £82.5, and Hong Kong-registered shares at £84.5. The Kaiping Coal Mine small registered shares rose by six pence to 18 shillings and six pence. The rest was flat.

The 1939 dividend of Shanghai Telephone Company, at six jiao per share, is scheduled to be distributed on December 27.

Also, the 1939 dividend of Jardine Matheson Spinning & Weaving Co., Ltd. is rumored to be first distributed at one yuan and seven jiao and five fen per share.

### Cotton Yarn: U.S. Cotton Export Subsidies Reduced for the Second Time; Morale Recovers; Manufacturers Enthusiastic About Buying Cotton

The trading of local cotton is still lively, with white bale, grass bale, and wooden frame machine-picked cotton being bought and sold among each other. Next is Tongzhou cotton. As for factory intakes, they are not very strong, but those who want to collect a large amount of spot goods fear that the market price will be difficult. This is because most counterparts are optimistic. Although the price of Lang cotton fell sharply today, the rise of U.S. cotton is dramatic, and it is reported that the export subsidy for U.S. cotton has been reduced to 40 pounds per pound, so morale has recovered. However, due to consecutive days of rising prices, some have made significant profits and have temporarily not taken action to collect as much as possible, so the rise is not strong, rising by two or three yuan compared to the previous day. The source of northern Jiangsu is 2,471 bales of Tonghua cotton, 390 bales of Changyinsha, and 1,765 bales of Beisha. There are 230 bales of cotton shipped to Hong Kong today. The current cotton transaction situation is listed below.

Today Yaohua Banned in Shanghai, but dozens of small bales of cotton are shipped daily from Tongchong Qihai and other places. Indian cotton has not been seen in Shanghai for the past few months. It is heard that the Italian ship Fu Er Bi (transliteration) has arrived in Shanghai, transporting 140 tons of cotton from Egypt, or more than 1,000 pieces. The ship is docked at the Hongshuntai Wharf for unloading, (ancestor).

In other news, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, is exceptionally quiet, but the market situation is unusually firm. Spot trading is very active. Overseas cotton merchants are quieter due to the reduction of export subsidies. Later, due to Wall Street's extremely strong purchases in the market, the closing price rose by more than 20 pounds. We have just received a telegram from the United States that the U.S. government will change the export subsidy to 40 pounds per pound starting at midnight today (previously 150 pounds per pound, which was recently changed to 75 pounds per pound), so the selling price of U.S. cotton overseas has risen a lot, but it is still cheaper than Indian cotton. Yesterday, Indian cotton fell by more than ten rupees, which is slightly closer to U.S. cotton. Yesterday, Egyptian cotton rose by more than 20 pounds, and Liverpool rose by six or seven pence. The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai, a British factory purchased 5,000 to 6,000 bales of U.S. cotton, and Chinese and Japanese factories had a total of more than 10,000 bales of transactions. In the future, the transaction of U.S. cotton may be temporarily deserted. The market price of U.S. cotton yesterday, converted at the U.S. exchange rate of 7.25, the delivery price is as follows,

20 Count U.S. Middling 230.00

20 Count U.S. Middling Lower Grade 225.40

31 Count U.S. Middling 137.35

31 Count U.S. Middling Lower Grade 230.90

42 Count U.S. Middling 239.15

42 Count U.S. Middling Lower Grade 232.75

### Consumption of 10 Counts Has Decreased; The Rise of the Yarn Market Is Circuitous

The yarn market continues to advance, and the situation is stable and quiet. As for actual sales, although Hong Kong merchants do not have wholesale transactions for coarse and fine yarn, sporadic purchases have not been interrupted, so morale is high. At the same time, although overseas Indian cotton has fallen, the rise of U.S. cotton is strong, and many parties are optimistic and want to further advance. Unfortunately, the consumption of 20-count yarn is not very strong, so the rise of the yarn market is still circuitous.

The current yarn market opened with U.S. cotton rising sharply, but Indian cotton has seen a rebound. However, the current key is U.S. cotton, because the price of Indian cotton is higher than U.S. cotton, and the calculation has long been impossible. Temporary decline does not cause problems for the yarn market. The opening price of yarn rose by five yuan, and the current price of 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse is 708 yuan. Soon it reached ten yuan, and then the demand for 20-count yarn from Guangdong merchants was not strong, and it hovered between ten yuan for a long time. The closing price was also flat. The transaction statistics for half a day totaled 2,605 bales, with the market price of 20-count Double Horse rising by six yuan, Tekin City rising by three yuan and a half, Tiannv rising by two yuan, and Double Earth rising by four yuan. Today, 80 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 10 pieces were shipped to Haiphong, and 310 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed on the left.

### Review of "A Combined Edition of the Ci Yuan Supplement and Continued Supplement"

— Ci Kai

Since its publication, the Ci Yuan Supplement and Continued Supplement have been popular everywhere and have long been well-received. Recently, the font has been reduced, the format has been enlarged, total page numbers have been added, and it has been combined and corrected, bringing three large volumes together into one volume, making it convenient for checking and carrying.

However, given this combined edition, I feel that there seems to have been a need for a strict correction beforehand. Now, the publication period of the second Continued Ci Yuan may be far away, and this opportunity for combination can be used to save some effort in compiling and printing the second Continued Ci Yuan. At the same time, we can obtain a perfect fixed edition in the years before the publication of the second Continued Ci Yuan. Therefore, slight flaws, such as the absence of "East Mountain Resurgence" and "Madame Curie," the error on page one, fourth line, that "water chestnut" is a "algae plant," and the delay in citing the "One Slice" of page two from the Book of Wei (for example, the "Spring and Autumn of Lu Bu" and the "Huainanzi" also have it), seem to be corrected and supplemented in this edition.

According to the "Explanation of the Combined Edition," this combination is not just a simple combination, but also includes the "addition" of "missing words," the "correction" of "errors," the "revision" of "sentences," and the "correction" of "nouns" in the main text. In a thick combined edition of Ci Yuan, it is really difficult to find it. Therefore, we do not know what kind of sentences need to be revised, what is the standard of revision; what kind of nouns need to be corrected, and what is the standard of correction. However, I feel that some larger places that involve two or more items also need to be revised and corrected. These have not been revised in several examples.

First: In the Continued Supplement, words and phrases that "supplement" the same meaning in the main edition should be merged into the corresponding common items, and the other items should be noted with the words "see a certain item for details." For example, "cucumber" can be merged into "yellow melon."

Second: For different entries with the same source, one can be abolished and replaced with the note "see a certain entry for details." For example, the "cut nails" on page noon-19 (originally in the Continued Supplement) can be merged into the "no intact eggs under an overturned nest" on page shen-113 (originally in the main edition); the "crushed mortar" on page shen-6 (originally in the Continued Supplement) can be merged into the "yellow silk young woman" on page hai-67 (originally in the main edition). "Potassium chromate" on page you-144 (originally in the main edition), "Potassium chromate" on page you-108 (originally in the main edition), and "Potassium permanganate" on page hai-20 (originally in the Continued Supplement) originally belonged to one thing, but the descriptions under each entry are slightly different, which makes it difficult for beginners to solve them. In addition, "Potassium permanganate" also notes "see Potassium chromate," but does not note "see Potassium permanganate." It is conceivable that the "heavy" and "over" entries do not "see" "high." It goes without saying that such items should be merged. Even if it cannot be merged, the items in the main edition that are related to the items in the Continued Supplement should also be noted to see a certain item, so as to be "mutually" visible, which is thoughtful.

Among the biological terms, the main edition does not note the Western names of the classification scholars, but the Continued Supplement does. After the merger, they are quite inconsistent, which seems to be a drawback. For example, the main edition has rhynchocoela, caudata, and marsupials, which are clearly distinguishable from the continued edition's unguiculata, podophora, loricata, pulmones, pterygota, tubulifera, and conifera. The names of the class, order, family, and genus are not as good as the species names. It does not matter much to omit the common Western names of species, but the names of class, order, family, and genus should be treated the same.

Incidentally, it is best to add a transliteration comparison table to the Ci Yuan to avoid the difficulty of wanting to check foreign personal and place names but not knowing how to translate the first character. Because in recent books, many foreign personal and place names are noted next to them, and the translators therefore translate them at will, without seeking precision. Therefore, it is not as good as the situation when the Ci Yuan was first published.

In short, it is rare to have this combination and publication of the Ci Yuan Supplement and Continued Supplement under wartime conditions. At the same time, it is probably not possible to do what I have hoped for, which is almost a rewriting, so this combined edition of the Ci Yuan Supplement and Continued Supplement is only a "combined edition" as its name indicates, a mixture of the main edition and the Continued Supplement, not a compound of them.

### Leading the Way - A Memoir of the Xiangbei Campaign

— Fen Lang

Due to the urgency of the war situation, the Brigade Headquarters was ordered to send two more regiments of troops to the front line for reinforcement. Furthermore, Brigade Commander Wang assigned me the task of "leading the way" this time. I rushed to the regimental headquarters stationed in the countryside and conveyed this urgent order. Coincidentally, the regimental commander was out drilling. Without further delay, I discussed it briefly with Deputy Regimental Commander Xu, and we decided to depart at eight o'clock tonight, passing over Hulu Mountain to reach Changsha. We would wait for further orders from the Brigade Headquarters in Changsha before advancing to the front line.

After dinner, I went outside and hired two porters to carry two loads of hand grenades. We set off towards Hulu Mountain, closely followed by a torrent of iron and blood—more than two thousand brothers. In my hand, I held a small torch, emitting a faint light, illuminating the winding mountain path. We quickened our pace and plunged into the gloomy valley.

Occasionally, turning my head back, I saw thousands of faint flashlight beams flickering amidst the dark, dense cliffs, winding and circling from one side to the other. Fragments of footsteps rustled down from the jungle, mingling with the night wind sliding down the hillside, all rushing towards the distant valley.

The two porters took very large strides, sometimes I could barely keep up. I dragged my swollen, stiff legs, struggling to keep pace on the mountainside. Suddenly, a violent echo resounded, and I knew we were in a deep, dark valley, so I proceeded even more cautiously. The cliffs were covered with moss, slippery as if they hadn't seen the sun in millennia. We had to change our hasty steps to crawling.

I felt quite exhausted and asked the porters:

"How far is it to Changsha?"

"Not far now. Follow the Chaodao Mountain Road, pass a few cliffs, and when you go downhill, you can see the lights of Changsha city."

The porter's tone was loud and clear; I knew he must not be tired at all. From the dim light of the torch, I could vaguely see his spirited expression.

After climbing over a cliff, we rushed into a ravine. The small torch flashed through the woods and between the rocks, and we turned into another cliff. At this time, no one wanted to speak; we just kept moving our legs as hard as we could, like untethered wild horses galloping into the boundless expanse.

Crossing this cliff, we saw the mountain path gradually sloping downwards. Just around the foot of the mountain, we saw a flickering light in the distance.

"That must be Changsha!" I thought to myself, and catching up with the porters, I took three steps in two.

As dawn broke, our company reached the military headquarters in Changsha to report. I also completed my task of "leading the way" with the two porters. After the porters put down the hand grenade boxes from their shoulders, I asked them,

"Was this leading the way tiring?"

"I didn't feel anything at all. On the contrary, my body feels much more refreshed," the porter said, shrugging his shoulders, with a chuckle they hadn't heard in a long time.

### The Beauty of Justice

— Ding Ti

Is beauty independent? According to Croce's school of thought, beauty is naturally considered isolated, a disinterested form of contemplation, a pure intuition. "The deep heart masters the flowers and trees, and far-reaching thoughts reach the wind and clouds." As long as its inherent image is conveyed through a suitable form, immersing you in the realm of intuition, it is nothing but beauty. This error clearly ignores the social nature of art; it fails to understand that the beauty of art is built on the foundation of society as a whole. To try to divide it with a knife or scissors is simply impossible. The existence of art is not yours or mine, nor is it a "superman" or "super-object" transcendent above society. It is a universal resonance within society, like sound waves or heat conduction in the air. Do you say it is independent? The momentary existence is indeed isolated, but we must never say that a pure image that transcends language has already accomplished the function of beauty. The important value of beauty still needs to be expressed in language, to have form, to make art spacious in time and enduring, this is true beauty. Then social conditions immediately follow; beauty, in terms of appreciating itself, is certainly isolated, but in terms of its conditions of existence, it cannot escape the connection with society as a whole.

We may not agree that literature is subservient to morality, but we should agree that the highest artistic beauty is justice. According to Yang Xiong and Cao Zhi, they both regarded the beauty of art too casually. One said it was a trivial skill, not something a strong man would do; the other said it was "insufficient to promote great righteousness and show it to future generations." As a result, the beauty in their eyes became a peach pit boat or a fly-head carving on ivory, meant only for people to play with and caress. One phrase replaced the evidence of the era, and the articles were hidden and selected. Besides being novel and beautiful, there was nothing else. If this were really the case, it would naturally be no wonder that a strong man would not do it. But we must ask: is this kind of artistic beauty really true beauty? Sadly, this kind of thing is not worthy of being called beauty! Truly valuable beauty must be dynamic, vibrant, and represent the intention of justice. No matter how the origin of art is explained, it is a fact that labor came before art. The pioneering of wilderness in ancient times, the competition of hunting, the wars between totems, all illustrate the struggle to complete life. From ancient times to the present, the potential of life has been lurking in the tide of literary evolution, and this potential dominates all the complex emotions of mankind. Whether floating on the surface of the waves or tumbling into the bottom of the vortex, it will not be dead or static, unless this era is dead and static.

Being dynamic and vibrant is not enough; it further requires the movement of justice. The rampancy of evil and the tension of drawn swords and cocked crossbows may have movement and vitality, but this is not beauty. A healthy work of art never allows it to be mixed in. The beauty of a healthy art is completely entrusted to the empathy of the times. In addition to the beauty and ugliness of reality, we should also have a kind of imagined beauty and ugliness. After the fusion of the two, there will be a more accurate evaluation of the real society, promoting the good and belittling the evil. Unknowingly, art has completed the highest instruction and symbol. This instruction and symbol is a beauty—the beauty of justice. This statement does not conflict with Croce's school of thought. Isolation still exists during appreciation, but the result truly becomes what is said in "Classic on Literature": "The great cause of governing the country, the grand event of immortality." The greatness of time and space, this is true greatness.

The beauty of art has a moral character, although from the beginning its original intention was not to preach. If you understand this sentence, then I can specifically point out how the beauty of justice exists. In terms of form, this is similar to what "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons" calls "style and substance." "If the words are upright and straightforward, then style and substance will be formed." Isn't "upright and straightforward" the image of the beauty of justice reflected in the form? It is exactly the opposite of the pre-Song literature criticized by Pei Ziye's "On Carving Insects": "Its rise is profound, its ambition is strong, skillful and able to be essential, hidden and able to be deep." Its greatness, in addition to revealing the original and vigorous power of mankind, can also establish a lofty and reasonable standard. Countless emotions, directly and indirectly, are dominated and influenced by this great potential. There is an invisible majesty, an unchangeable image and fixed knowledge, which can be found in the lines and between the lines. To be specific, this may be called style and substance. Style and substance is a perfect thing that symbolizes the beauty of justice.

Describe the beauty of flowers and plants? Sing the praises of the ivory tower? Erotic beauty, leisurely beauty... we can put down our pens. Let the rapid current that has been lurking under the whirlpool for thousands of years surge to the surface of the river, become waves, and establish lofty style and substance. This is true beauty, great and just. Beauty need not be sought elsewhere. Flaubert tells us: "It is nothing but justice."

### Brave Words Before Battle

— By Byron, Translated by Pin Pin

Soldiers and officers! If spear and sword pierce me,
When I lead the people to charge,
Do not worry about my corpse under your feet, though I am the leader:
Stick your weapons in the land to swear an oath!

If, holding my shield and my bow,
You, as my comrades, flee in battle,
Then chop me up!
I have always made the enemy flee in disarray.

Say goodbye to others, but we will never betray each other,
You are my glorious successors, my sincere brothers!
May the country prosper and its power spread,
Be determined to die gloriously, today!

(Original title: Song of Saul before his Last Battle)

### Chen Charlie's Troubles

— Hua Zhi

Naughty children - volunteer to form detective teams
Activities everywhere - people can't stand the disturbance

More than a decade ago, Sherlock Holmes detective films were popular in Hollywood, but recently they have turned into the era of Chen Charlie. Chen Charlie is a Chinese name, and his appearance and style are also orientalized. Warner Oland, who was famous for playing the great detective Chen Charlie, was very popular for a while. Unfortunately, Mr. Hua died of a sudden illness a few years ago, and the film industry was greatly disappointed. Not long after, 20th Century Fox found a new "Chen Charlie" named Sidney Toler. After appearing in a few scenes, many boys, just like our country's children who are fascinated by martial arts swordsmen, wanted to worship him as their "old man" and learn detective techniques. The most clamorous were a group of naughty children in Honolulu, who voluntarily formed a "Charlie Chen Junior Police" and hailed the great Chen Charlie as their honorary captain. They shouldered their burdens, went around asking for information, and investigating materials, and submitted detailed reports of their investigations to Chen Charlie. These little Chen Charlies took their work too seriously, and when they encountered what they considered difficult cases, they did not hesitate to puncture people's tires, smash store windows, and sometimes damage people's telephone lines in order to get to the bottom of things. After the matter was completed, they all made a "Chen Charlie investigated" mark. People were unbearable and asked Chen Charlie, several times a week. Chen Charlie wanted to resign from the title of honorary captain, but he was afraid of affecting his reputation; if this continued, he was afraid of causing a catastrophe, and he felt quite troubled.

### Zhao Jinrong's Performance at Tianchan Cancelled, Waiting for a Ship North

— Wei Wei

It has been half a month since Zhao Jinrong stopped performing at Gengxin. The first batch of Beijing actors at Gengxin, Liang Yunqiu, Wu Suqiu, Chen Shaolin, etc., have all returned north one after another, but Jinrong is still stranded in Shanghai. Recently, news came out that Jinrong would perform a short-term performance at the Tianchan Theater in the coming days, and the theater had also invited veteran actor Wang Qingchen and young actor Zhou Xiaofang to cooperate with Zhao. The reporter visited Jinrong at her residence on Yuyuan Road yesterday to inquire about the matter of performing at Tianchan, as there was a reason for it. But Jinrong completely denied it. According to her, the Tianchan Theater did send someone to contact her, but she was invited by the Gengxin Theater, and although she had completed her contract, she was still not convenient to join another troupe. In addition, due to other relationships, she declined. Therefore, the rumor that Jinrong will perform at Tianchan is something that cannot be realized.

Also, it is reported that Zhao Jinrong was originally scheduled to perform three charity performances at the Golden Grand Theater after Wang Yurong's contract expired, at the invitation of the Jiping Guild Relief Committee and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. The repertoire had been finalized as "The Jade Hairpin," "Yu Tang Chun," and "Fourth Son Visiting Mother." It is now learned that Yu Rong has declined the invitation from Tianchan, and also said that she will no longer participate in the three charity performances at the Golden Grand Theater. It is said that Jinrong has been in Shanghai for a long time, and her heart is eager to return. She has decided to take the Shuntian ship north in mid-month. The new actors of the Golden Grand Theater, Ye Shenglan and Guan Shengxi, etc., will take the Shuntian south. The ship is expected to arrive in port on the 14th and dock on the 16th. Jinrong will only stay in Shanghai for a week, and then she will buy a boat back to the north.

### Gorky's Childhood - Soon to be Released in Shanghai

It has been three years since Gorky passed away. In order to commemorate this great writer, the Soviet Union has decided to put several of Gorky's famous works on the screen in terms of film.

Previously, "Mother" had already been filmed once as a silent film. "Twenty-One Men and One Woman," "The Lower Depths," and others were prepared for filming but were not completed. Now being filmed are his play "The Enemies" and Gorky's trilogy. Gorky's trilogy is "My Childhood," "My Apprenticeship," and "My Universities."

"My Childhood," under the name "Gorky's Childhood," is scheduled to open at the Great Shanghai Theater on the 13th. This will be a valuable opportunity for those who respect Gorky.

Dance World Writing

### Magazine (1)

— Xiao Tian

The Xilimen is located at the corner of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road, with three sections: the front is the ballroom, the middle is the tea room, and the back is the garden. The dance floor is rectangular and quite narrow. It is already crowded with more than ten couples dancing at the same time. The four walls are painted with more than a dozen (May Fourth) nude beauty paintings, which are probably what the hall's advertisement calls the "Nude Palace Spring Colors." The music is provided by a six-person band, five men and one woman, which has a different style compared to the large ballrooms. There are more than thirty dance hostesses, but few are beautiful. I once saw a certain newspaper praise a Li Yaping. A friend of mine had the intention of asking about her, but when he asked the waiter, the lady he pointed out had no resemblance to the one described in the newspaper in terms of appearance or figure. The drinks are of incomparable quality. The tea leaves all have stems, and the coffee is even more unpalatable. I think that the Feida next door, with its coffee and black tea, is extremely exquisite, and the price of coffee is only 50 cents and black tea is 40 cents. This hall might as well buy from its neighbor and sell it at twice the price, which would be mutually beneficial to both parties. When I suggested this to the waiter, he insisted that it was impossible, so our group had no choice but to return to our office.

Ru Aina of the Dametropolis has been dining with the same people recently, and the more familiar she becomes, the less she seems to have the habits of a dance hostess. A certain famous lawyer has also been frequently asking her to dance recently. According to Ru, her regular customers have no evil thoughts, which is commendable. I said that it is already very unfortunate for a woman to sell her appearance to make a living, so she should strive to move into the upper class. The only way to do this is to spend time with people from the upper class every day, and over time, it will become natural. It is like entering a room full of orchids, and after a long time, you no longer smell the fragrance. Gu Tianhong speaks the soft language of the Wu dialect, is tall and graceful, and greets people with a smile. Her aura is also quite upper-class. I told the person in charge of the Dametropolis that this woman will definitely become popular over time, so be careful not to let another family take her away.

Zai Lizhen has been retired from the dance hall for more than a year. Lidu has a Zhu Shanshan who is very close to Zai. The other day, when she was accompanying a guest at the counter, her eyelids were red and swollen like walnuts. When asked, she talked about Wang Tu's suicide by throwing himself into the Huangpu River. Like the rabbit mourning the fox, feeling sorry for his kind, she shed a tear of sympathy. In the past, when she accompanied dances at the Xuan Palace, she had bright eyes and white teeth, innocent and lively, and her singing voice was loud and clear. She was a promising newcomer. Later, I heard that the famous flower was transplanted to the Forbidden Garden, and she had already given birth to a daughter. Now, fortunately, she has been rescued unharmed. The affairs of her boudoir cannot be changed. However, the little girl has a narrow temperament. If she is not unruly and difficult to tame, she should be made to read more books and treated well.

### Playwright in "China's Mirror" (4) - Random Memories by Meibian (7)

— Li Feishu

With a "pop," like the sound of a champagne bottle cork popping out of the bottle, this was another customs official cutting the tightly bound rope around the "tinplate" box with scissors. The box was opened! The first thing that caught my eye was a leather jacket. I was asked about the price of this jacket, and I answered with the actual price. Not only did he have doubts, but he also thought that the price I quoted was too low to be normal. He held the leather jacket in his hand and asked other customs officials around, and everyone's answers seemed to say: "There is a need for consideration." At this time, I had to wait for their "questioning." Suddenly, one person caught sight of a large white envelope, hidden at the bottom of the box. They rushed forward, their shape like a group of wild beasts who had been hungry for a long time, discovering their food. They eagerly took it out and opened it, and a "handsome young man" was clearly present. I also seemed to have something to rely on! I hurriedly told him: "Mei Lanfang! Mei Lanfang! Who is he? You often know him! Inside this white envelope, there is nothing else except this photo and his autograph."

At this time, the fierce and terrifying faces of many customs officials immediately changed to a friendly attitude, completely different from before. The person who "helped me refold the leather jacket" was the person who "just now haggled with me over the price of the leather jacket." He no longer talked about the price of the leather jacket, nor did he inspect the rest of the luggage, and immediately returned to me a "luggage tag that could go directly to the Polish border."

With a Chinese drama utensil, he was able to completely eliminate the difficulties encountered here, and turn the customs official's "indifferent words" and "mocking expressions" into "nodding in respect." Later, when I returned to the platform, several Chinese soldiers came to protect me, asking frequently as they walked: "How is Mr. Mei doing recently? How many times have you seen Mr. Mei's plays this time?" At this time, a question arose in my mind: "May I ask, in which European and American countries is there another stage artist who can turn a suspected traveler into a VIP escorted by the police?"

Two Charity Performances at the End of the Year

Tiwei has already written in this newspaper about the Carlton's charity performance at the end of the year, and the Golden Grand Theater will also perform three charity performances two days before closing the box, taking the same steps as the Carlton, distributing rice tickets with the proceeds from ticket sales to help the poor, and placing disaster relief in the middle of entertainment. The method is very good.

Among the three plays at the Golden Grand Theater, one is a Shanghai-style new play, "Nine Lives Cat Changing Prince," performed jointly by famous Shanghai amateur actors and reporters from the literary and art circles. Zhao Ruquan has been specially invited to direct, and Chen Yuelou, Zhang Guifen, Li Ruchun and others have been hired as consultants. A public banquet was held for Zhao Ruquan and Chen Yuelou at the Tiantian Hotel yesterday (7th) at 4:00 p.m., where the plot was explained on the spot, talents were recruited, and roles were assigned.

As for the full-length "Chain Set" at the Carlton, the roles have been finalized, and Zhou Xinfang has been invited to direct.

### A Fan Letter to Chen Yunshang

— Xin Ying

In Hollywood, whether male or female, after becoming a star, they will receive a lot of fan letters every day. The green man arrives with a thick stack, all letters sent by fans from all over the United States and even the world. This is how Hollywood's big stars are. Chinese stars are no exception, and fans often write letters to them. However, the number of letters is certainly far less than that of American stars. Here, we want to talk about a fan letter to Chen Yunshang.

Chen Yunshang today has become the only female star in China, after winning the throne of female stars like Hu Die and Ruan Lingyu in those years, fans from all over China often write letters to her, either to compliment her or to ask her for photos.

Not only in various parts of China, but also in the Philippines, Malaysia, Australia, etc., Chinese films are often shown in those places, so many people will write letters to Ms. Chen, especially the overseas Chinese who account for most of the letter writers.

Since Chen Yunshang starred in "Mulan Joins the Army," after it was released in the United States, the three words "Chen Yunshang" were imprinted on the brains of many American fans. As a result, every foreign ship sailing from the United States to China is bound to have a large number of letters sent to Ms. Chen's film company, all written by American fans. The only reason American fans write letters to Ms. Chen is that after watching "Mulan Joins the Army," they admire her art very much, so they write letters to ask her for photos or handwritten Chinese signatures as souvenirs.

In order to deal with the large number of fan letters, Ms. Chen employs a female secretary at home who is fluent in both Chinese and English, and is about the same age as her. If she has news, she replies to some of the letters herself, and if she is filming, the work of replying to letters is handled by the female secretary.
