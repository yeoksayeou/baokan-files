### England Agrees to Extradite Four Chinese in Tianjin Case; Chinese Government Lodges Formal Protest; Demands That Those Requesting Extradition of Suspects Are Not Chinese Authorities; England's Actions Are Legally and Morally Indefensible; Tianjin Residents in Two Concessions Write to British Ambassador Expressing Their Position

(Chongqing) Regarding the British government's decision to hand over the four Chinese held in the British concession in Tianjin to the so-called "local court" for trial, the Chinese government has lodged a formal protest with the British government. This protest was lodged simultaneously by Ambassador to England Guo Taiqi and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the British Embassy. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement today, saying, "This move by the British government is a clear violation of the law and a betrayal of the promise made by Britain, as a member of the League of Nations, not to recognize any situation created by force. If the aforementioned individuals are indeed innocent, they should be released. If there is indeed evidence of a crime, they should be handed over to the officials of the Chinese government. The whole world knows that the so-called "local court" is actually a puppet organization created by Japan's invasion of China. Handing over any Chinese people to this court for trial is tantamount to handing them over to our enemies. The means by which the Japanese treat innocent people have long been evident to all. Therefore, this move by Britain is legally and morally indefensible. The British authorities previously notified China that the detainees would continue to be held in the British concession, implying that they would not be handed over to any other party. The Chinese authorities are truly shocked by the British government's sudden decision. After the bizarre negotiations in Tokyo have been stalled for so long, and while the British concession in Tianjin is still blockaded by the Japanese army, the British government actually considered its so-called new evidence and believed that this evidence made it necessary to hand over these unfortunate Chinese to the puppet organization established by the invaders. While the Chinese side is putting up a heroic resistance to those who are disrupting world peace, the British government feels it is okay to submit to the Japanese's illegitimate demands and thereby damage British rights in the Far East. This is truly regrettable." People from all walks of life in China here were very troubled when they heard about the British government's decision. The news arrived in Chongqing late at night, so the Chinese newspapers did not have time to criticize it this morning. In the past few weeks, the Chinese had believed that the British government would be able to adopt a stronger attitude in the Far East after the United States announced the abolition of the US-Japan Trade Treaty and the Tokyo negotiations stalled for nearly half a month. They are now suddenly hearing this news, so they cannot help but feel grief and indignation. (Reuters, 12th)

(London) The Chinese Embassy recently issued a statement saying, "Ambassador Guo Taiqi delivered a note to the British Foreign Office this morning, requesting the British government to reconsider its decision to hand over the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Xigeng case in Tianjin to the North China authorities controlled by the Japanese army, and to draw the British government's attention to Article 21 of the 1856 Sino-British Tianjin Treaty, which stipulates that "If Chinese criminals hide in British ships or houses in the treaty ports, the British Consul shall hand them over upon notification by Chinese officials." Therefore, in the Cheng Xigeng case, the party requesting the extradition of the so-called suspects is not the competent authority of the Chinese government, but the Japanese army and its puppets. If the so-called suspects are handed over to a court controlled by the Japanese army for trial, there is no legal basis for this, and it will also completely deprive the so-called suspects of their right to a fair trial. This is contrary to the traditional British justice. The world will misunderstand this move as a de facto recognition of an illegal regime, thereby endangering political principles and causing a huge impact." (Havas, 12th)

(London) Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi today sent a note to the British Foreign Office, urging Britain to reconsider its decision to extradite the four suspects in Tianjin, and requesting attention to the provisions of Article 21 of the Tianjin Treaty, which states that the extradition of Chinese criminals must be carried out after the Chinese authorities submit a request to the British Consul. Guo also pointed out that the party requesting the extradition of criminals is not the legitimate official of the Chinese government, but the Japanese army and its puppets. If these suspects are handed over to a court under Japanese rule, it would be inappropriate from a legal standpoint, and they would lose all opportunities for a fair trial. In fact, it is also inconsistent with the traditional fairness of the British. Guo concluded by saying that this matter may be interpreted as a de facto recognition of an illegal regime and contains far-reaching political principles and consequences. (Reuters, 12th)

(Tianjin) According to sources in the British concession here, the British Municipal Council has not yet received orders regarding the handover of the four suspects in the Cheng assassination case. The British concession in Tianjin is now almost a military camp, with British troops and the International Volunteers ordered to be ready for action, fearing the outbreak of an anti-British movement in the Chinese area. Most of the Chinese staff in British shops in the Japanese-controlled areas have moved elsewhere. (Associated Press, 12th)

(Chongqing) The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an important statement today regarding the British decision to hand over the four Chinese involved in the Tianjin case, saying that the Chinese government has protested the British decision to hand over the Chinese held in the British concession in Tianjin to the so-called (local court). This decision by the British side is obviously illegal and also goes against the British commitment, as a member of the League of Nations, not to recognize situations created by force. If the Chinese being handed over are innocent, they should have been released long ago. If they are indeed suspected of committing a crime, they should be handed over to the officials of the Chinese government. The so-called (local court) is a puppet organization created by the Japanese invasion of China, which is a fact known to the world. Handing over our Chinese people to this pseudo-organization is tantamount to handing them over to the Japanese, and there is no need to elaborate on how the Japanese mistreat innocent civilians. This measure is difficult to defend both legally and morally. The British side had informed our country's authorities that the detained Chinese would continue to be detained, meaning that they did not intend to transfer them to any party, but now the British government's decision to hand them over is even more unacceptable. Moreover, the arrest of these people took place after the Japanese army tightened the blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, and the British government began to study the so-called supplementary evidence during the extraordinary meeting in Tokyo, and this evidence, the British side believes, necessitates the transfer of these Chinese to the pseudo-organization. China is bravely resisting those who are disrupting world peace, but the British government is succumbing to their unreasonable demands, while at the same time allowing their eastern ambitions to be trampled on, which cannot but be deeply regretted. (12th Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Tianjin news: The British and French concessions in Tianjin, regarding the Japanese army's blockade of the concessions and the fabricated public opinion to launch an anti-British movement, jointly wrote to the Tianjin British Consulate General on the 11th, requesting that it be forwarded to the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, to express the true attitude of the Chinese in the concession and urge the British government to pay attention and adopt a stronger strategy towards Japan. A separate letter was sent to the Tianjin French Consul General and the French Ambassador to China, Cosme, stating that if Japan forces Britain to submit in North China, then [France's] interests in North China will be even more untenable. The original letter to the British Ambassador is translated as follows: "In the capacity of Tianjin citizens, we would like to say a few words to Your Excellency the Ambassador. We firmly believe that what we are about to say is exactly what the Chinese citizens living in Tianjin want to say. The Japanese army has been blockading the Tianjin concessions for nearly two months. During this period, the inhumane treatment suffered by both Chinese and foreigners is a clear and visible fact. The Japanese army's behavior uses the pretext of maintaining the security of the occupied areas and building a new order in East Asia, while using the instigation of anti-British movements as a means to try to make the peace-loving British submit to violence. The unreasonable demands repeatedly put forward by Japan at the Tokyo conference are also a manifestation of this consistent policy. Therefore, we would like to present the following basic facts to Your Excellency the Ambassador, hoping that your government will not be blinded by Japan's one-sided propaganda. First, we believe that Beijing and Tianjin are still war zones and not Japanese-occupied areas. The activity of guerrillas in the suburbs and the frequent attacks on the Japanese army are clear evidence. As for the so-called (building a new order in East Asia), it is just another pleasant-sounding way for the Japanese to dominate East Asia, and it is not worth refuting. Second, we are people under the rule of the National Government. We have always expressed our sincere gratitude to your country for sympathizing with and helping our resistance against Japan. Recently, Japan has instigated their puppets and used bought ignorant hooligans to launch anti-British movements everywhere. This is just a cover for their own atrocities. Not only can it not represent the public opinion of China, but it is precisely to destroy the public opinion of China. We hope that Your Excellency the Ambassador can pay special attention to this. The Tokyo conference has lasted for several weeks. Under the premise that Japan wants to dominate East Asia, the future of the talks is fundamentally bleak. Making concessions will only increase the ambition of the aggressor. If your government does not want your country's interests in China to be plundered, it can only adopt effective countermeasures. Compromising and seeking solutions at the conference table will only leave endless troubles." (12th Dispatch)

### Hunan Expected to Have a Bountiful Harvest

Hengyang: Since the start of summer in Hunan Province, the weather has been favorable, and a bountiful harvest is expected this year. Since the new rice has been put on the market, the price of rice has been falling daily, and late rice is also being planted everywhere. (11th Dispatch)

### Residents of Shenyang Terrified; False Air Raid Alarm

(Shenyang) At 3:00 AM this morning, alarms sounded everywhere in Shenyang. Residents were in the middle of their dreams when they heard the alarms and thought that Soviet planes were attacking. They jumped out of bed and rushed to the air raid shelters to take refuge. All lights were turned off, and all traffic stopped. Trains were moved from the station to other locations to avoid being attacked. After investigation, it was found that a passerby saw a fire and, out of excessive excitement, mistakenly reported it to the "Air Defense Headquarters," causing the residents to be terrified. (Associated Press, 12th)

Editorial

### Shanghai in Transition

Japan has been plotting to invade China for a long time, even before 1894 (Jiawu); it began using force to carry out its piecemeal encroachment with the September 18th Incident in 1931; and it is now attempting to swallow China whole, using force to penetrate deeply and force China to either disintegrate and surrender or to bravely resist. The all-out war of resistance began with the July 7th Incident in 1937; advancing from the north and south, it attempted to realize its ambition to swallow China whole. Thus, China implemented all-out resistance two years ago today. Based on these historical records, it is unclear how the Chinese authorities will choose one of these dates in the future as a memorial day for survival and resurrection; but in terms of the history of China's nation-building, today two years ago is undoubtedly an important stage worthy of commemoration. Because after the implementation of all-out resistance: within China, national consciousness awakened, national spirit was renewed, the great cause of unification was completed, and the Three Principles of the People were promoted. The National Government, which had been in power for many years, was now happily supported by the entire country, and the respected Chairman Chiang was now sincerely believed in by the entire nation. As for Japan, all its hopes of defeating China one by one, using Chinese to control Chinese, achieving a quick victory, and destroying the country and exterminating the race were dashed. It realized that its dream was not going to come true and began to endlessly deplete its national strength. As for the international community, it had a new and fresh perspective on this nation-state of 450 million people, re-evaluated it, sincerely sympathized with it, and provided substantial support. All of these things were epoch-making two years ago today. Shanghai has its own special significance: not only did the source of the war break out in Shanghai, but also the tragic artillery fire and heroic resistance gave Shanghai residents new stimulation and new education. Not only did Shanghai change its nature and environment, but Shanghai, which has been open to trade for nearly a century, has gradually become a "international zone" in transition for the past two years, indicating that post-war Shanghai will inevitably need a new foundation and cultivate a new life!

It is difficult for us to predict what kind of encounters or changes Shanghai will experience from now until the end of the Sino-Japanese War. It is difficult for us to imagine what Shanghai will look like after the end of the Sino-Japanese War. In short, there are too many different and even unexpected possibilities. But based on the current situation, recalling the past two years, and comparing it with the situation two years ago, we can at least say that Shanghai is moving towards [text missing] . Is the future of [text missing] destruction? Possible, but definitely not inevitable! Is the future of [text missing] coming? Also possible, but definitely not inevitable! Then who can be the master of Shanghai's future? In terms of the new foundation that Shanghai needs and the cultivation of its new life, there is no doubt that it depends on the victory of China's war of resistance. Then the master has its own place. The problem is not there, but in the transitional period from today until the victory is certain.

In this transitional period, there are too many possibilities for Shanghai in [text missing] to move towards destruction. Who hates Shanghai, who can destroy Shanghai; who does not want Shanghai, who can destroy Shanghai; who covets Shanghai and wants it exclusively, then who else will cherish Shanghai! Of course, we in Shanghai do not want Shanghai to be destroyed, and it is not difficult to not destroy it. Just as long as everyone recognizes that this is an international zone, so many hands make light work!

During this transitional period, Shanghai's economic situation is very different from the past: two years ago, industry and commerce flourished, and citizens lived and worked in peace; today last year, we only felt the great disaster of refugees; today this year, everything is expensive, and the residents are in great distress. Two years ago, Shanghai was full of talented people in every aspect, doing things and making achievements; in the past two years, they have left Shanghai and gone their separate ways, leaving behind a large but low-quality sedimentation. Those who remain in Shanghai cannot make a great contribution to Shanghai's business. Two years ago, businesses were concentrated in Shanghai, and funds were concentrated in Shanghai; in the past two years, businesses have either declined or moved inland, and productive capital has also abandoned Shanghai. The financial resources remaining in Shanghai and flowing into Shanghai from the occupied areas do not become productive capital but are gradually consumed, and are bound to become increasingly depleted. A very small number of people have made fortunes through dishonest means, but the vast majority have become penniless. The primary cause of the import surplus is the exodus of capital.

All of the above clearly shows that since two years ago and even in the near future, Shanghai is moving forward in [text missing] . If this progress does not stop, it will lead to natural destruction. Fortunately, progress is not endless. The further away we are from today two years ago, the closer we are to the certain victory of the war of resistance. But there are two comparisons between the destruction and [text missing]: one is to compare the sustainability of Shanghai with the period of the war of resistance, and the other is to compare the sustainability of Shanghai with its consumption. Residents can at least control a portion of the success or failure of the comparison themselves. How to control it? Fundamentally, it lies in how to strengthen the strength of the war of resistance to promote the certainty of victory; in the smaller and nearer term, it lies in thriftily cherishing all of one's own strength, so that the period of self-maintenance can be extended. Try to examine one's own private room, and even the main streets, allowing them to be public places. There are countless things that should be and can be conserved. We should not say that not being frugal is because private wealth is abundant. We should understand that the prosperity and decline of the social economy is a whole of society. If Shanghai cannot plan well for the transition, the wealthy will not be able to take care of themselves alone!

Although today two years ago is worth commemorating, we still have to plan for today next year.

### Tokyo Negotiations Unlikely to Resume Soon; Britain Concedes on Security Issues; Japanese Army Representative in Tianjin to Return to Post

(London) Regarding the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo, the British government has telegraphed new instructions to its ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie. Sources here have stated that these instructions only relate to police and administrative issues in the British concession in Tianjin. As for financial issues, Britain is consulting with France and the United States, and it is feared that they cannot be resolved in the short term. (Havas, 12th)

(London) Regarding the news reported by the Japanese side that the Japanese chief representative Kato had refused to continue the Tokyo Anglo-Japanese negotiations based on the latest instructions received by the British Ambassador Robert Craigie, the Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the content of these instructions mostly concerned the protection of order in Tianjin. As for the broader issues arising from the blockade of the concession, the British government has repeatedly made it clear that this is not only related to Britain and Japan. This move by Britain does not completely prevent the discussion of such events in Tokyo, but indicates that Britain's observation point is supported by other relevant countries. These countries have also stated to Japan and Britain that they are by no means unrelated to the above matters. (Reuters, 12th)

(Tokyo) On the morning of the 12th, British Consul Havard sought an interview with Consul Tanaka and met at the official residence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:30. Consul Havard explained the final views of the British government on the security issue and submitted the written proposal to the Japanese side, requesting understanding. On the other hand, Ambassador Craigie also sought an interview with Minister Kato and met at the official residence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00. Craigie reiterated that the British government's response on economic issues has not yet arrived, so there is no certainty as to when the talks will resume. In order to break the deadlock, it would be better to reopen the meeting based on the materials already received, while quietly waiting for the rest of the response to arrive. Minister Kato immediately replied that if the meeting is conducted based on the materials already received, then in essence, the security police issue will inevitably be discussed first, while the economic issue will be isolated. This will inevitably affect the overall compromise of the meeting, so the Japanese side absolutely cannot agree. This is the policy of the Japanese government and cannot be changed at all. He expressed a stern refusal to Ambassador Craigie. Then, Ambassador Craigie asked if the departure of the Japanese military representative from Beijing to Tianjin could be temporarily postponed, and if the British government's response arrived after the military representative left Beijing, could the talks continue? Minister Kato replied that the departure of the Japanese military representative from Beijing to return to his post was due to the necessity of military operations, so there was absolutely no room for considering a postponement. As for whether the talks will continue to be held in Tokyo after the response from the British government arrives after the departure, this will be considered and decided by the Japanese government from its own standpoint. Therefore, the meeting on that day yielded no results, and there is no hope that the seventh meeting between Britain and Japan will be held on the 12th and 13th. The hope of holding it on the 14th is also extremely slim. (Allied Press, 12th)

(Tokyo) On the 12th, Craigie met with Ambassador Kato and stated that the British side had no intention of holding the seventh meeting. The Japanese side immediately followed the planned policy and withdrew the local military representative to return to Tianjin. Therefore, the military representative, Major General Muto, visited Director Kurihara of the East Asia Bureau at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 2:05 PM on the 12th. After discussing for 30 minutes, he left and went to the official residence of the Foreign Minister to meet with Foreign Minister Arita for important talks. As a result, Foreign Minister Arita summoned Director Sawada and Minister Kato to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3:20 PM to discuss the handling of various situations after the military representative returned to Tianjin. The points agreed upon are listed below: 1. After the military representative returns to Tianjin, if the British side receives the British response and wants to hold a continuation meeting, the Daily Affairs Bureau should judge whether the content of the response is sincere and decide whether to hold the meeting. 2. If the talks proceed smoothly, the representative will not be summoned again. 3. Whether or not the seventh meeting will be held will be the sole responsibility of Minister Kato. Furthermore, after the Japanese military representative returns to Tianjin, Japan will be more thorough in its established policy. Japan is paying close attention to the actions of the British side in the future. (Allied Press, 12th)

(London) The British government yesterday sent detailed instructions by telegram to the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, so the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo may be restored. It is said that the new instructions are mostly about protecting the British concession in Tianjin and not allowing the activities of anti-Japanese terrorists. It is believed that the currency system and silver issue in North China were also mentioned. Yesterday morning, the British government notified Japan that the Tianjin British Concession Municipal Council was prepared to extradite four Chinese suspects to the Chinese local "court" under Japanese control. Another Chinese, who was arrested by the British concession authorities in September 1938 based on information provided by Japan, will also be extradited to the inland "court" "based on sufficient legal principles." A British government spokesman explained last night that the extradition of the four Chinese suspects was handled separately from other issues in the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. It is said that the suspect case is entirely based on judicial concepts. The spokesperson stated that the extradition of the Chinese suspects was not a bargain made by Britain to Japan. The decision was entirely based on the legal point of new evidence being discovered. (Associated Press, 12th)

(Tianjin) It was learned today that the British Consulate General here has not yet received instructions regarding the extradition of the four Chinese suspects. The British Concession Garrison has now been ordered to prepare in case of riots on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Shanghai War tomorrow. The military and police are currently deploying everything. (Reuters, 12th)

(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers today seem to find it strange that the British unilaterally announced the procedures for extraditing the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin. Asahi Shimbun stated that when British Ambassador Craigie notified the Japanese chief representative Kato that the British side intended to announce its acceptance of the Japanese request to extradite the four Chinese suspects, Kato replied that he had no objection to this matter and said that the Japanese side did not pay attention to such trivial matters and that he wanted to proceed with the talks on important issues as soon as possible. The Daily News was dissatisfied with the announcement of these minor issues, saying that if the instructions from London required by the Japanese side were not received on Sunday night, the Tianjin Japanese military representative would report to North China on Monday morning. (Reuters, 12th)

### British Extradition Case of Four Chinese Sparks Domestic Outcry: Aid China Committee Protests to Foreign Secretary; British Dignitaries Argue from Legal Standpoint

(London) Following the British government's decision to hand over the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin, the British Aid China Movement Committee has sent a letter to Foreign Secretary Halifax expressing its protest. The letter stated, "The government's decision to hand over these four Chinese to the Japanese, or their so-called 'Chinese authorities,' is tantamount to making Britain an accomplice in Japan's war against China." The lives of these Chinese will certainly not be spared after the handover. "The British government previously pursued a policy of appeasement and reached a preliminary agreement with Japan, effectively granting Japan various rights in the illegal occupation of certain areas of China. Now, it is resorting to appeasement again, which we cannot condone." In addition, Professor Bentwich of International Relations at the University of Jerusalem and Ms. Fry, a director of the British Broadcasting Corporation, have also jointly sent a telegram to Foreign Secretary Halifax, stating, "We are shocked to hear reports that the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin may be extradited to the Japanese. We intend to petition the British Supreme Court in Shanghai to issue a writ of habeas corpus to prove that the handover is illegal. This procedure will take fifteen days. During this period, we urge the government to provide assurances that all methods not expressly provided for by law will be avoided." The London Trades Union Congress has also made the same request to Foreign Secretary Halifax. (Havass dispatch, 11th)

(London) The British government's decision to extradite the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin has provoked strong criticism in today's British newspapers. The News Chronicle stated that the decision here lacks adequate legal basis. Japan has no legal status in China, like a thief in a mint. It is almost impossible for people around the world, including the Japanese, not to believe that the British government's move is driven by self-interest. The British government has once again yielded to the pressure of violence. The United States must feel the same way, as must the United States, France, Poland, and General Chiang Kai-shek. Tokyo will see this as clear evidence that it can demand further concessions from Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

(London) Regarding the British newspapers' criticism of the government's decision to extradite the Tianjin suspects, The Times stated that the Japanese initially refused to hand over the evidence of the Tianjin suspects' crimes in Tianjin. Now, they are disclosing it in Tokyo as much as possible. This alone shows that the Japanese are trying to repeatedly create and prolong the Tianjin dispute. Unfortunately, the British authorities on the ground apparently disagree and have failed to properly mediate a difficult situation for London. The British government has given strict consideration to the legal importance of the Tianjin local situation, but it tends to neglect the broader reality of Britain's position in the Far East. The government seems prepared to suffer the unfortunate consequences that this decision will have in China, the United States, and elsewhere. However, what the British people are now asking is whether the extradition of the suspects is unconditional. If so, why not attach conditions? The Japanese have repeatedly spoken of respecting the law. Why can't the British government ask the Japanese to prove their words with action, such as in the case of British military officer Spear's detention? Now, the Japanese army is accommodating and allowing a senior British military officer to enjoy full diplomatic privileges, while the British government is making concessions to the wishes of the Japanese army. Even those who are educated and do not consider many of Britain's claims to be reasonable must see this as a strange thing. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

(Tianjin) The British government's proposal to extradite the four Chinese detained in the British Concession in Tianjin for interrogation by the "Provisional Government" in Peiping has become a topic of conversation among Chinese and foreigners here. According to the general opinion of foreigners, although they all recognize this as a minor issue, they previously supported the extradition of the aforementioned individuals to the de facto Chinese authorities because they were remnants of guerrillas and posed a potential threat to the neutrality of the concession. Moreover, their right to hide in the concession was ambiguous. However, since the British government decided not to extradite them, the general foreign community has not expressed any dissatisfaction. It is now believed that the British Foreign Secretary Halifax, with the advice of legal experts, has suddenly changed his decision to allow the extradition, and there must be a good reason for it. However, in political terms, it is highly doubtful whether this kind of correction of errors is a smart move. It is feared that the motivation for this move may cause misunderstandings between China and Japan, leading to equally unfortunate repercussions for Britain's prestige. At the same time, the British authorities here have explicitly refused to comment on the extradition of the four Chinese. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Japanese Authorities in North China Gradually Admit to Launching Anti-British Movement: Major Anti-British Conference to be Held in Tianjin Tomorrow to Discuss Plans to Strengthen the Anti-British Movement

(Peiping) The Japanese authorities are gradually admitting that they are the initiators of the anti-British movement in North China. When asked about rumors that all Chinese employees of a certain British bank would resign, Colonel Nagai, a spokesperson for the Japanese army in Peiping, replied, "I don't know, but I hope so." When asked about the threatening letters received by Chinese servants employed by the British, Nagai admitted that such letters were indeed illegal but claimed that these servants were "ignorant" and needed to be educated about the anti-British movement because they did not know that what Britain was doing was detrimental to China. The person in charge of the anti-British organization in Tianjin has scheduled a major anti-British conference for August 14 to discuss plans to strengthen the anti-British movement. It is reported that the plans include (1) permanently establishing all anti-British organizations, (2) connecting them with the Japanese-organized New People's Society, (3) including anti-British education in the permanent curriculum of all primary schools, (4) launching anti-British newspapers, (5) discussing ways to put pressure on the British to abandon their interests and leave North China, (6) revoking the citizenship of Chinese who work for the British, and (7) organizing anti-British movements in British colonies and India. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

(Hankow) The Japanese Consulate here today notified the British Consulate that the Japanese military authorities have ordered a halt to the anti-British movement. This announcement has somewhat eased the tense atmosphere, as people were generally afraid that serious anti-British demonstrations would occur on the second anniversary of the Shanghai Battle. The Japanese-run Wuhan News reported on August 10 that Japanese residents planned to participate in the anti-British demonstration on August 13, and anti-British slogans had been posted all over the city two days ago. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

(Tianjin) Of the seventy Chinese employees of the British trading company, Jardine Matheson, which was vandalized by rioters on August 4, sixty-five have now resigned due to intimidation. Their reason is that if they do not resign, they or their families will be harmed. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Japan Establishes Air Force Base on Santsu Island: Tokyo Newspaper Calls it a "White Blade Pointing Directly at Hong Kong"; Italian Consul General in Hong Kong Arrives in Japan for Activities

(Tokyo) Regarding the establishment of a Japanese air force base on Santsu Island near Hong Kong, the "Nichinichi Shimbun" commented today, calling it a "white blade pointing directly at Hong Kong." According to the newspaper, since the Japanese army occupied the island in December 1937, it has transformed the island into a base for seaplanes, thirteen miles southeast of the mouth of the Pearl River and fifty miles southwest of Hong Kong, in eighteen months. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 12th)

(Yokohama) Upon arriving here aboard a Japanese ship, Rear Admiral Mellili, the Italian Consul General in Hong Kong, reportedly told Japanese journalists that Hong Kong's defenses were very weak and that the Japanese navy could easily seize it in thirty minutes. He also said that the anti-British movement in China was spreading and had an adverse impact on Hong Kong's security. He believed that the British were despairing of Hong Kong's defenses. Mellili claimed that he had repeatedly made frank remarks in Hong Kong, leading the Hong Kong authorities to consider him an unwelcome person. He is now in Japan to discuss a certain important matter with the Italian Ambassador to Japan, but he is not at liberty to announce the details. He will remain in Tokyo indefinitely, and the Italian Consul in Guangzhou will also come to Tokyo to discuss matters with the ambassador. He will prohibit the sale of arms to General Chiang Kai-shek and advocate strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact to cope with the complex international situation. He has been the Italian Consul General in Hong Kong for three and a half years. Previously, he was a Rear Admiral in the Italian Navy. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Battle Situation in Hunan and Hubei Provinces Now Favorable to China: Chinese Troops in Hunan Approach Suburbs of Yuezhou City; Chinese Troops in Hubei Recover Many Key Areas Recently

(Chongqing) Chinese military sources here claim that the battle situation in Hunan and Hubei provinces has now clearly shifted in favor of China. Since the Chinese army launched a counteroffensive, it has been gaining ground steadily. In Hunan, it has penetrated the outskirts of Yuezhou and is engaged in fierce fighting. One Chinese army is attempting to encircle the city completely, isolating the Japanese troops inside. However, as of now, the Japanese are still able to maintain water and land transportation. Chinese military personnel strongly deny the Japanese claim of victory in the area, insisting that it is purely Japanese propaganda and has no basis in fact. In Hubei, the Chinese army claims to have completely recovered the positions it had lost in recent days and is approaching the important Japanese base of Suixian. Senior Chinese generals are confident that before the arrival of new Japanese reinforcements, the Japanese troops on all fronts will be unable to launch a counteroffensive. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 12th)

(Yichuan) Dispatch from Ji Shi on the 11th: Approximately 200 Japanese troops from Wan'an harassed Fancun (northwest of Wan'an) on the morning of the 8th. They encountered a Chinese company and engaged in fierce fighting for some time. The Japanese attacked and occupied Shangxiacun. After a fierce counterattack by Chinese forces, the Japanese troops were defeated and retreated to Wan'an. (Dispatch on the 11th)

(Gao'an) On the 10th, Chinese troops in northern Jiangxi attacked the Xishan Wanshou Palace and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops at Maojiaqiao Xinwu, seven li southeast of the palace, all night. Forty Japanese troops were killed, and two heavy and light machine guns each, twenty rifles, and four pistols were captured. The Chinese troops are continuing their advance in victory.

### Sir Otto Niemeyer Returns to Hong Kong from Shanghai: to Confer with Xu Kan Within Days; Refrains from Commenting on Chinese Currency Issues: No New Financial Arrangements Appear Imminent at Present

(Hong Kong) Sir Otto Niemeyer, the British banking expert and member of the British-Chinese stabilization fund, recently conferred with Chinese and foreign financial circles in Shanghai and returned here today aboard the Victoria liner. Niemeyer declined to comment on Chinese currency issues, but well-informed sources here believe that no new financial arrangements have been made, at least for the time being. It is reported that Finance Minister Xu Kan has arrived here from Chongqing and is likely to confer with Niemeyer within days. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Japanese Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb Zhangzhou

(Fuzhou) On the 7th, twenty-five Japanese aircraft took off from Xiamen in two waves and bombed the county seat of Zhangzhou, dropping as many as 100 bombs. The urban area, which has suffered its third major calamity, has been mostly reduced to ashes. On the same day, the aircraft also targeted the American Methodist Episcopal Church in the city and dropped three bombs, completely destroying the church. In addition, the Catholic church was also hit by two bombs, and most of the buildings were destroyed, killing two people and injuring one. Several American, French, and Belgian missionaries were involved, and it is not yet clear whether they were killed or injured. However, this provides strong evidence that the Japanese aircraft deliberately destroyed the property of third countries. (Dispatch on the 11th)

(Chongqing) Wuyuan, west of Suiyuan, north of the Hetao, was bombed by twenty-eight Japanese aircraft on August 10, dropping fifty bombs and leaflets, killing thirty-nine people, injuring more than twenty, and destroying thirty houses. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Ten Newspapers in Chongqing Resume Individual Publication: Chen Cheng to Broadcast Tonight

(Chongqing) Since the Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing fiercely on May 3 and 4, ten local newspapers have jointly published the United Daily News until today. Starting tomorrow, the anniversary of the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, each newspaper will resume individual publication. Several newspaper offices have moved their offices and printing facilities to the suburbs to avoid Japanese air raids. Recently, newspaper prices have been high, selling for eighty yuan each. Therefore, each newspaper is now raising its price, selling for seven cents per copy. General Chen Cheng, Minister of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, will broadcast tonight on the topic "From July 7 to August 13." General Zhang Zhizhong, former Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army in Shanghai, will speak tomorrow at the August 13 Luncheon Club about his experiences on the Shanghai battlefield.

The delegation will depart in September, traveling to Tibet via India. In addition to other matters, the delegation will also attend the enthronement ceremony of the new Dalai Lama. The new Dalai Lama will be selected from three candidates, two of whom were discovered near Lhasa and one in Qinghai. It is now believed that the child discovered in Qinghai is almost certain to be selected. Lhasa now has a wireless telegraph station communicating with Chongqing. The previous Chinese delegation to Tibet was in 1934, led by Huang Musong. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Hai River in Tianjin Floods: Water Level with the Banks

(Tianjin) The Hai River has flooded due to rising water levels upstream and a breach in the embankment. The water level is now high, and if it rises another foot, boats will be able to sail in the streets of the British Concession, further increasing its hardship. The current water level is at the same level as the banks, and efforts are underway to block the water. Sandbags have been placed along the banks, and water is seeping from two ditches on Victoria Road. It is reported that the authorities are making every effort to protect Tianjin from flooding, but the current situation is very serious. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

(Guilin) The Guangxi Mutual Aid Society and the Farmers' Loan Association have established simple granaries to regulate the production and sale of food and rural finance, engaging in the storage, mortgaging, transportation, and sale of agricultural products. (Dispatch on the 11th)

### Puppet Organization in Peiping Plans to Strengthen Existing Regime

(Tokyo) According to reports from Peiping, Wang Jingwei's peace movement has given a new impetus to the political circles there to strengthen the existing regime. Political figures believe that it is currently too early to predict the establishment of a central government in China, as various conveniences in finance, economy, politics, and public order are not yet on the right track. Therefore, the establishment of an administrative organ may not be able to immediately take over the responsibility of maintaining law and order in the occupied areas, as the Japanese army is currently doing. Therefore, strengthening the current administrative organ is an urgent step to assist in establishing a new order in East Asia. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Overseas Chinese in Annam Telegraph British Prime Minister, Requesting Sanctions Against Japan

(Chongqing) According to news from here today, the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association in Annam telegraphed British Prime Minister Chamberlain yesterday, asking him to follow the United States and abolish commercial treaties with Japan, as only economic sanctions can protect British interests in China. At the same time, the association also telegraphed President Roosevelt, expressing the satisfaction of the overseas Chinese in Annam with the United States' abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty.

### International Situation Becoming Increasingly Serious: Roosevelt Makes Statement; Will Convene Special Session of Congress If Necessary; President Has the Right to Warn People Not to Travel on Foreign Ships

(Hyde Park, New York) President Roosevelt stated at a press conference today that, to his knowledge, there is currently no reason to convene a special session of Congress in the fall. If there is indeed a situation in Europe or the Far East where war is about to break out, he may convene a special session of Congress to determine that the United States, in accordance with international public law, remains neutral and avoids being drawn into the vortex. Generally speaking, he favors the form of neutrality that the government previously sought but failed to achieve, namely, legislation that makes the United States truly neutral and cancels the ban on the sale of munitions. When asked if the cash-and-carry system would also be abolished, President Roosevelt replied that this could be handled in many ways, so he could not give a definitive answer. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(Hyde Park) President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that if an actual war crisis develops in Europe or the East, Congress will be immediately convened in a special session to enact laws to protect American neutrality based on international law. The President continued in cautious terms that he did not feel there was any reason to convene a special session before the regular session of Congress in January 1940. Should it be necessary to convene a special session of Congress, the neutrality procedures proposed by the government should still be the same as those that were shelved by Congress in the previous session. He remained firmly in favor of the "cash and carry" policy for the sale of arms and raw materials. He could not determine whether it was necessary to enact legislation to implement the policy. What the government proposed was to return American neutrality to the principles of international law. President Roosevelt pointed out that the President of the United States, without special action by Congress, has broad powers to take multiple steps to ensure national neutrality. The President has the power to warn the American people not to travel on foreign ships, a power that President Wilson did not exercise before the Lusitania disaster. President Roosevelt stated that if American citizens disregard the government's warnings and still travel on foreign ships, and those ships are sunk by submarines of other countries, the United States does not intend to declare war on those countries because of this.

### Japanese Government Agrees on Policy Toward Europe: Hiranuma Makes Statement

(Tokyo) According to news from here today, Foreign Minister Arita, because the cabinet did not approve the proposal of Army Minister Itagaki for Japan to formally join the German-Italian military alliance, discussed with Prime Minister Hiranuma the wording of the Japanese foreign policy to be announced on the 15th of this month. During his meeting with Hiranuma, Arita will also discuss the results of the meeting between Kato, the chief representative of Japan attending the Tokyo Anglo-Japanese Conference, and British Ambassador Craigie. It is reported that after discussing with Arita, Hiranuma will go to a nearby summer resort to report to the Emperor on the domestic and foreign situation. (Associated Press dispatch, 12th)

(Kanagawa Prefecture, Kanazawa) Prime Minister Hiranuma left the Prime Minister's residence at 4:20 PM on the 12th and went to the Higashiya Ryokan in Kanazawa to rest. He is scheduled to go to the Hayama Imperial Villa at 9:00 AM on the 14th to pay respects to the Emperor and present all future countermeasures, before returning to the Higashiya Ryokan. On the morning of the 15th, he will return to Tokyo. On the night of the 12th, the Prime Minister issued a statement on the European policy issue at the Higashiya Ryokan as follows: The government has already decided on the fundamental policy regarding the European policy, but all the details are still under consideration. As a result of the agreement reached at the Five-Minister Conference on the 8th of this month, there are no particular difficulties in reviewing the matter at the Five-Minister Conference held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Prime Minister also said that the European policy had nothing to do with the progress of the Anglo-Japanese talks, so the government authorities were studying this fundamental policy for future development.

### Commander of the First Army of the Far Eastern Red Army Changes

(Moscow) The "Red Banner" newspaper in Vladivostok, dated July 26, was recently received here, referring to General Popov's title as Commander of the First Army of the Far Eastern Red Army. Observers were surprised to learn of this, saying that the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Far Eastern Red Army (including the First and Second Armies) was concurrently held by General Shi Jiao, the Commander of the First Army, until this month on the 6th, when it was still published in the newspaper, indicating that this public official had not been reprimanded. Now that the Vladivostok Red Banner newspaper has this record, General Shi may have been transferred to the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces, fighting with the Japanese-Mongolian forces on the border between "Man" and Mongolia.

### German and Italian Diplomatic Contacts: Reviewing European Strategies; Intensified Political Activities in Central Europe; Compromise Reportedly Reached on the Danzig Issue

Bayschtesgaden: Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived here at noon today from Salzburg to pay his respects to Führer Hitler. Foreign Minister Ciano arrived at 1:30 PM and was treated to a banquet by Führer Hitler. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, the German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, and the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Attolico, were all in attendance. After the banquet, the Führer held a long conversation with Foreign Minister Ciano. (Havas News Agency, 12th)

Salzburg: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop held important political discussions here yesterday on issues such as the Danzig situation and Japan's joining the Axis military alliance. Ribbentrop does not understand Italian, and Ciano does not speak German, so they spoke in English. After the initial talks, the Italian and German diplomatic authorities will meet with Hitler this morning to present their views on European and Far Eastern affairs. Regarding the Japanese issue, it is noteworthy that Ciano stated that he had held important talks with the Japanese Ambassador to Italy before leaving Italy. (Reuters, 12th)

(Rome) According to Guido, the mouthpiece of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in the Italian Daily today, the meeting between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Salzburg resulted in a complete compromise on Danzig and other issues. From now on, the Danzig issue will be resolved according to its natural center of gravity. Guido continued, stating that Germany and Italy do not need to take the lead in this historically significant period because they know that time will bring about an inevitable conclusion. Italy and Germany believe that the revision of the Danzig status should be aided by reason and magnanimity, that is, by good and peaceful methods. However, they should jointly prepare for all contingencies based on the compromise reached thus far. (Reuters, 12th)

(Paris) The talks between the Italian and German Foreign Ministers in Salzburg, Germany, are being extensively discussed by various newspapers here. It is generally believed that the decisions made by the two are very important. Many newspapers also stated that the goal of these talks is to strengthen the alliance between the two Axis powers and to take final measures in the hope of large-scale political action in Central Europe. A special correspondent of the right-wing "Echo de Paris" in Salzburg reported that "there is no doubt that differences have arisen between Germany and Italy. On the German side, Führer Hitler wants to occupy the Free City of Danzig before the National Socialist Party's national congress at the beginning of next month. On the Italian side, Prime Minister Mussolini wants to avoid an international crisis in the near future and intends to strive for the realization of his demands regarding the Mediterranean. According to reliable sources, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will present a detailed plan to Foreign Minister Ciano today, the main points of which are: (1) Hungary should join the 'Pact of Steel,' (2) The Free City of Danzig should be annexed by Germany, (3) In order to realize Italy's demands regarding the Mediterranean, significant pressure should first be exerted on Yugoslavia." (Havas News Agency, 12th)

(Berlin) The National Socialist Party's official newspaper, "Der Angriff," recently published shocking news, claiming that during the talks between the German and Italian Foreign Ministers in Salzburg, the issue of revising the Treaty of Trianon, which the Allied Powers imposed on Hungary after the European War, and the Treaty of Saint-Germain, which they imposed on the former Austria, were brought up for discussion. It stated, "The maintenance of European peace depends not only on the resolution of the Danzig issue but also on the revision of the Treaties of Trianon and Saint-Germain. This matter should be implemented by absolutely reliable means." These two treaties delineated the borders of the countries in Southeastern Europe. If this is the case, Germany and Italy may take action in the Balkans in the near future. Experienced observers here recently commented that Germany's movements regarding the Free City of Danzig are merely a smokescreen; in reality, a major event is brewing in Southeastern Europe. This can be seen in the "Der Angriff" article. In general, relations between Hungary and the Slovakian state are quite tense, which Germany can use as a pretext for intervention, just as it used the tense relations between the Czech and Slovak peoples in March of this year to place the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia under protection. Rumors are circulating that Germany intends to partition the Slovakian state, annexing most of its territory into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and ceding the rest to Hungary, in exchange for that country allowing the National Socialist Party to come to power. Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky came to Salzburg a few days ago to negotiate with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, supposedly for this very reason, but officials are keeping silent.

### Italian Prime Minister May Propose an International Conference to Improve Relations Between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy; Italian Newspaper Advocates for Danzig's Return to Germany

(London) The Financial Times' diplomatic correspondent recently stated that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini may propose convening an international conference in the near future in the hope of improving relations between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy and discussing certain international economic and political issues. Mussolini is once again trying to moderate the policies of German Führer Hitler and persuade him not to achieve his territorial demands by means that would lead to war, which is the same advice he gave last September. (Havas News Agency, 12th) (Rome) The semi-official magazine "International Relations" recently published an article commenting on the Danzig issue, issuing a warning to Poland, stating that if the country stubbornly adheres to its views and provokes a war, and the civilized countries intervene, Italy will immediately assist Germany. It stated, "Poland's current policy is a suicidal policy. As a result, the country's territory will inevitably be divided." In fact, the Danzig issue is very simple. The main points are no more than six: (1) Danzig is Germanic in nature and should belong to Germany. The current system in the city stems from the spirit of the Treaty of Versailles, which no longer exists. Danzig is not essential to Poland's survival. (2) Germany only demands the annexation of Danzig and does not covet an inch of Polish land. (3) If Poland wants to develop freely as an independent country, it must maintain friendly relations with Germany due to geographical reasons. (4) If Poland stubbornly adheres to its views, hoping for the assistance of Britain and France, it is embarking on a path of suicide and partition. Germany and Italy will never allow it to be a vanguard in Eastern Europe, which is the position stipulated by the Franco-Polish alliance treaty of 1921. In short, if Poland rejects all solutions that would allow Danzig to be annexed into Germany, it may one day have to accept the most embarrassing solution. (5) Whether Poland can occupy an important position in Europe depends on its relationship with Germany. There are only four major powers in Europe (referring to Britain, France, Germany, and Italy). Poland is not necessary to maintain the European balance of power. If Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck continues to implement Beneš's policies (the former President of Czechoslovakia), he will end up on the banks of the Thames River, like Selassie (the Emperor of Abyssinia), Beneš, and Zogu (the King of Albania). (6) The entire Baltic Sea is controlled by Germany. If Poland wants to retain Danzig, it is attempting to control the Baltic Sea, which is extremely arrogant. If the civilized countries intervene in the Danzig issue, it will harm the vital interests of the Axis powers, and the Axis powers will never allow them to preemptively strike. One day, the name of Poland may be removed from the map of Europe. Anyone who wants to maintain the independence of Poland should be aware of this. Polish nationalists can point their cannons at the German border, but if Germany opens fire on other borders in order to defend its rights and vital interests, "Italy's cannons will also roar."

### British, French, and Soviet Staff Talks Officially Began Yesterday Morning

(Moscow) According to official announcements, the British and French military missions that arrived here yesterday will begin staff talks with the Soviet Union at 11:00 this morning. The meeting place is the famous Spiridonovka Mansion, the former residence of Foreign Minister Litvinov. After arriving here yesterday, the British and French representatives formally visited Soviet Defense Minister General Voroshilov, which lasted for 45 minutes. They also met with Foreign Minister Molotov. Last night, the US government hosted a banquet for them. (Reuters, 12th)

### Famous Dutch Banking Company Suddenly Declares Bankruptcy: European Financial World Greatly Shocked

Amsterdam: One of Europe's largest private banks, Mendelssohn & Co., applied to the government yesterday for a suspension of payments. European financiers were greatly shocked, and Dutch stocks in Paris, Amsterdam, and London markets immediately plummeted. After London banks provided assistance, they rebounded slightly, and the market stabilized. It is generally believed that Mendelssohn & Co. took this action due to a lack of liquid cash. Mendelssohn & Co. is one of Germany's oldest banks. The Amsterdam branch was established in 1920 and is currently the only affected branch. It is also noteworthy that the bank's president, Mr. Max Heimann, passed away in Paris on Wednesday due to a heart attack. His family does not believe there is any secret. Mendelssohn has taken the place of the former Rothschild in Europe today. (Associated Press, 12th)

(Paris) The French Ministry of Finance issued an official statement last night stating that the actions of Amsterdam's Mendelssohn & Co. do not affect the recent payment of France's rearmament fund loan. This rearmament fund is guaranteed by a Dutch and Swiss banking group. The late manager of Mendelssohn & Co., Max Heimann, was the chairman of this international banking group. Dutch stocks in the Paris market stabilized after the government's announcement, and the Dutch guilder and French franc also stabilized. (Associated Press, 12th)

Brussels: The Belgian Minister of Finance announced yesterday that after the sudden death of Dr. Mannheim, General Manager of Amsterdam's Mendelssohn Banking Company, and the company's declaration of bankruptcy, the Belgian government was not affected because it had no deposits with the company. However, the government recently renegotiated a fixed-term one-year loan of one million Dutch guilders with the company for the national budget. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

### US Building Five Air Force Bases on Pacific Islands: Costs Require $14 Million; Japanese Military Personnel Write Books on Strategies Against the United States

(Washington) The Navy Department has approved a contract for US$14,500,000 to build five air force bases in the Pacific Ocean between Japan and the United States, namely, one base each in Kaneohe Bay and Pearl Harbor on the island of Hawaii, and one each on Midway Island, Johnston Island, and Palmyra Island. (Reuters, 12th)

(Tokyo) A book entitled "The Imminent War Between Japan and the United States" written by a retired Japanese military man named Saito, was published today. In this book, Saito extensively discusses his strategy for Japan to conquer the United States, stating, "The first thing Japan must seize is Hawaii. The second step is to destroy the Panama Canal in the United States and defeat its main naval force. The third step is to send troops to land on the west coast of the United States and destroy its cities and naval ports. The fourth step is to form a major defense line along the Rocky Mountains, using the west coast as a base and gradually advancing toward the east coast of the United States."

### American-Made Aircraft Exported to Japan: Valued at $750,000 Last Month

(Washington) The State Department recently announced that export licenses for military supplies worth a total of US$39,920,738 were issued in July. Among them, aircraft and parts shipped to France accounted for US$35,419,372, the largest amount of military supplies purchased by a country from the United States in a single month. Aircraft and parts shipped to the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies accounted for US$2,514,899. Douglas aircraft and autogyros worth US$757,000 were shipped to Japan. According to the State Department's explanation, Secretary of State Hull advised domestic aircraft manufacturers on July 1 of last year not to sell aircraft to countries that bomb civilians. However, Japan's order for Douglas aircraft was placed in March of last year, so it cannot be regarded as a violation of the State Department's advice, with the exception of the autogyros. In addition, the actual value of US military supplies exported in July totaled US$10,114,366, of which aircraft purchased by Britain accounted for US$5,794,900, aircraft purchased by France accounted for US$3,030,560, and the remainder was accounted for by the Netherlands, the Dutch East Indies, Brazil, and Canada. Japan purchased aircraft valued at US$32,000. (Havas News Agency, 11th)

### New York Times Commentary: Britain's Far East Policy; Japan Forces Britain to End Aid to China; US Greatly Concerned About British-Japanese Dispute

The New York Times editorial on July 18 stated that Chamberlain's statement in the House of Commons yesterday that Britain "will not and cannot revise its policy in the Far East at the request of other countries" can be called a "request," a "demand," or a "suggestion." None of these terms lack good reason to believe that Japan has decided to make a major change in British policy and is still determined to do so, and that the entire "crisis" in Tianjin was deliberately created for this purpose.

Japan's war in China

has lasted for two years, and it has now discovered that it cannot effectively govern the vast areas ravaged by its troops. Japan has a "front line" in China, but behind that "front line," all kinds of local wars are taking place. Japan cannot even plan to develop the Chinese markets and resources that are its goals, let alone start developing them. It needs even more troops in China, and this need is increasing. Japan's gold is running out, trade has to be controlled, and prices are rising daily. Its people have to pay the price for paper victories. These victories offer no interest except for the list of casualties caused by the gradual decline in living standards. Under these circumstances, Japan's opinion, which allows it to be issued by the military, is

engaged in seeking the culprit

and has already seen it in Britain. If the Chinese continue to fight resolutely despite all difficulties, if they refuse to "cooperate" with the Japanese who are so cooperative in completing their self-destruction, and if they express the strange desire to defend Chinese territory, then Japan now believes that Britain is largely to blame. Britain has extended credit loans to China, sold it guns, and kept the Burma Road open for the transport of armaments. Most seriously, Britain has refused to recognize Japan's clear "superior rights" and has actively encouraged the Chinese spirit of resistance. Now there are all kinds of reasons to believe that the Japanese

created the Tianjin dispute

with the sole purpose of forcing Britain to end all material and spiritual aid to China. The completely unimportant incident involving four unfortunate Chinese "suspects" was quickly used as an opportunity to make broader proposals. This is sufficient to prove the above statement. What the Japanese insist on is not the deprivation of British power in Tianjin, or even the surrender of the entire British concession, but that Britain agrees to help the Japanese act throughout China. The New York Times' dispatch from Tokyo has clarified the truth. A dispatch from Tokyo recently stated, "If Britain proposes a plan declaring recognition of the 'New Order in East Asia,' then all of Britain's disputes will disappear. This is beyond doubt." But what will happen after that? We can again quote a dispatch from Tokyo: "The Japanese army will broadcast this declaration by Britain throughout China as a confirmation that Chiang's resistance is hopeless." The Japanese will rely on a major blow to Chinese morale and the embargo on armaments that they hope to force Britain to implement, and achieve the final victory that their own troops and terrorism have failed to achieve. The East

The importance of the current situation

is fully comparable to the European situation before the Munich Conference, not only in terms of the huge interests involved, but also in other aspects. It is similar to the situation before the Munich Conference because another weak country (China instead of Czechoslovakia) is seeking Britain's help, or at least hoping for Britain's moral support, and another aggressor (Japan instead of Germany) is using indirect threats to British security as a way to force Britain to follow its own plan of conquest. Britain, again understanding its military disadvantages (the lack of air defense last autumn, the distance to China now), has been forced to weigh the major question of whether it is worthwhile to sacrifice long-standing national interests in order to seek immediate peace. In fact, the two situations are so similar, except for one point,

During the Munich Conference,

The US government was only a concerned observer, and its greatest concern was to maintain peace. In the current events, the US government has informed Japan that we have our own direct interests in China - very large interests - and that we must be concerned about the "broader situation" of Japan's dispute with Britain. The Japanese government is now gambling on another Munich. If it ignores the implications of this warning, it will fail to heed the advice.

### Crushing Defeat of Japanese Army in Southern Jiangsu; Main General Demoted to Korea; Suzuki’s Troops Subordinated to Idomo

Suzhou Dispatch: Since the previous month, the Japanese army stationed in the Suzhou-Wuxi area has been repeatedly and severely attacked by the crossing-river Chinese army and has been routed. Major General Suzuki, the commander of the Japanese army in charge of southern Jiangsu, recently received an order from the Japanese Ministry of the Army to be transferred to Korea. It is said that the reason for his transfer was entirely due to the failure of the operation and the ineffectiveness of his command. The remnants of the troops led by Suzuki will be temporarily subordinated to the Idomo unit here.

### Japanese Troops Invading Guangdong Coast Disturb Baoan County; Repelled by Defending Troops During Landing Attempt; Situation in Southern Guangdong Province Becomes Urgent Again

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese army invading Guangdong has been adopting a strategy of mobile attacks to harass the coast for the past month. After the unsuccessful invasion of Zhongshan, it recently planned to invade Baoan in the eastern district, attempting to occupy the county, break out of the Shenzhen Station of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and directly cut off the traffic between the Chinese and British sections of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, cutting off transportation between the two sides, indirectly threatening Hong Kong and Kowloon. However, Baoan has been harassed by the Japanese army more than once, but they have retreated after each disturbance, merely making overtures to the British government in Hong Kong. On the 5th of this month, the Japanese navy attempted to land in Baoan again, which was also a kind of demonstration to the British side.

It is reported that the Japanese navy's reconnaissance of Baoan on the 5th involved two or three gunboats sailing to the Daya Bay waters of Baoan County, circling and exploring the water depth along the coast. Until 2:00 AM on the 5th, several ships released rubber boats and combined with motorboats, with more than a hundred sailors, distributing them across the sea. At about 5:00 AM, as dawn was about to break, the Japanese warships in Daya Bay fired cannons at the shore of Baoan, firing dozens of rounds in a row. The villagers in the Gushu and Nantou areas had already been startled birds. Suddenly hearing the sound of cannons, they fled to a safe area to take temporary refuge. Amidst the cannon fire, the Japanese motorboats carrying soldiers approached the shore, attempting to land, but the Chinese troops defending the territory calmly responded, waiting for the Japanese soldiers to wade through the sandy beach before opening fire with machine guns, forcing the Japanese soldiers to retreat and preventing them from landing. After half an hour, as it dawned, they boarded their boats and fled back to the Japanese warships. Although they have not continued to invade in the past few days, the Japanese warships in Daya Bay have not left, and their intent to spy has not been completely subdued.

As for the southern sea, the situation has recently become more serious. The southern part of Guangdong is the gateway to Guangxi Province, which is also the outer defense line of Guangxi. The Guiyang General Headquarters has long anticipated the Japanese army's ambition to invade Guangxi and has never relaxed. Its invasion routes into Guangxi are: one route is through Zhaoqing into Wuzhou, and another route is through the naval invasion of Qinzhou and Lianzhou in southern Guangdong, landing and entering Nanning. The two routes would advance together to encircle Guangxi on a large scale, which would not be easy to achieve without the use of 100,000 troops. If only one side proceeds, the Chinese army in Xijiang and Beijiang in Guangdong Province will contain it, making it difficult to proceed. It is better to use the navy and air force to attack Qinzhou and Lianzhou, directly attacking Nanning, which is more direct. There is no fear of the rear, and Japanese warships can gallop freely in the Qinzhou and Lianzhou waters. Therefore, in terms of landing, it is easier for the Japanese army to enter Guangxi via Qinzhou and Lianzhou, and it is a matter of course that Qinzhou and Lianzhou in Guangdong Province are inevitable in a battle. As for Leizhou and the two Yangs, Gaozhou, which are adjacent to Qinzhou and Lianzhou, and have extended coastlines, will inevitably be the targets of Japanese invasions. Therefore, Xuwen and Suixi in Leizhou, Meilu in Gaozhou, and Zhaipo in Yangjiang have been constantly bombed by Japanese aircraft in the past month. The county seat of Suixi was bombed by Japanese aircraft with more than a dozen bombs on the 6th of this month, killing and injuring many people. Fangcheng near Qinzhou was suddenly invaded by hundreds of Japanese naval soldiers on the 31st of last month, with the Japanese warships firing platoon guns to cover them. Fortunately, the defending troops in the area launched a head-on attack, and the Japanese soldiers did not succeed. However, the turbulent situation in the southern district has become increasingly tense in the past month.

A dispatch from Xuzhou states that the Japanese Central China Army Headquarters, feeling greatly threatened by the large Chinese forces entering Southern Shandong and penetrating deep into their occupied territory, launched a multi-pronged offensive last month from Qingdao, Zhoucun, Jinan, Tai'an, Xuzhou, and Linyi, attacking the Chinese army and various other forces in Southern Shandong. They also used aircraft to assist in the battle. The Chinese forces initially engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army in Dongtai, Laiwu, Mengyin, Yishui, and other areas. They also fought bloody battles with the Japanese army east of the Tai-Zhao Highway in Rizhao, Zhucheng, and other places, in dozens of major and minor battles. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. According to recent intelligence, the bodies of Japanese soldiers killed in action in Southern Shandong were all transported to Da Wenkou Station, totaling nine shipments and over 3,000 corpses. Among them were Infantry Colonel Yoshimaru Seibu, Cavalry Colonel Maeuchi, and Artillery Colonel Ozutsumi Shitsuro, all three. After a memorial service by the Japanese army stationed in Da Wenkou, the bodies were transported to Jinan for cremation. The transported war dead were in a state of severe decomposition. Many of the wounded, over 4,000, were transported to Tai'an, which proves the severity of the casualties suffered by the Japanese army invading Southern Shandong.

Another report states that a Japanese aircraft carrier arrived at Shijiusuo, which belongs to Rizhao County, a few days ago, carrying more than ten aircraft. The aircraft took off every day, destroying most of the nearby coastal villages in an attempt to threaten the Chinese army's base. The carrier stayed for three or four days before sailing elsewhere. Recently, two more Japanese warships arrived, carrying more than 500 Japanese soldiers. They also docked at Shijiusuo. A portion of the soldiers landed using small motorboats and built a floating pontoon bridge with civilian boats, allowing automobiles to drive directly onto the ships. As for the remaining Japanese troops in Lu Village, they have recently fled to the Qinjia and Sangyuan areas. The Japanese army in Southern Shandong has been attacked separately by the frontline Chinese forces and has mostly retreated. Only a small number of remnants remain in each city stronghold for defense, but they are terrified of a Chinese counterattack. Recently, the Japanese troops who attacked Gushan and Zhouzhuang were ambushed by the Chinese army's division, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers. The remaining troops fled in disarray towards Tieche and Hongya.

### Jiangsu Education Department Orders All Schools Resuming Classes in Shanghai to Jointly Improve: Finances to be Publicly Disclosed and Submitted for Approval; Strict Restrictions on Teachers Taking Additional Classes

(Dispatch from Taixian) The Jiangsu Education Department notes that nearly fifty secondary schools from various parts of Jiangsu that have relocated to Shanghai to resume classes after the war, with almost ten thousand students, have a significant educational mission and many areas that need improvement. It has listed eleven key points in a circular to all schools for joint and effective improvement: (1) In the future, schools in Jiangsu Province wishing to resume classes in Shanghai must first apply for and obtain approval in accordance with regulations before commencing operations. (In the future, organizational details, a list of teachers, a list of students, a budget of income and expenditure, and a general description of school facilities must be submitted in advance for review. Only after approval can classes be opened. Otherwise, all public, private, and county-run schools will be prohibited.) (2) Schools' funding should strive to be self-sufficient. (If funding is insufficient, facilities will be inadequate, and if teachers' salaries are too low, teaching will be difficult to focus on. This will not only mislead students, but also cause great distress to the managing personnel. A proper remedy should be promptly planned. Otherwise, it will not meet the conditions for school resumption and cannot be approved.) (3) All facilities in schools should strive to conform to the principle of economy. (If schools can always adhere to the principle of economy, it will reduce the burden on students. The Department has already stipulated standards for school fees. A small number of schools that exceed the standard have also been ordered to reduce them. However, these standards were originally set as the maximum amount, and considering the economic capacity of students' families, they are still slightly high. Schools should, as far as possible, reduce the burden on students, except for the salaries of faculty and staff, which must be maintained at a level that can sustain necessary living.) (4) All faculty and staff in schools should eliminate personal biases, consider the overall situation, and strive for the development of school affairs. (5) Schools' finances must be made public and submitted for approval in accordance with regulations. (6) Strict restrictions should be placed on teachers taking additional classes. (Some teachers take on more than forty hours of additional classes per week. Not only teachers, but even principals often hold other positions, which is not a way to value education. Teachers in all schools should strictly limit additional classes in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry, and principals should focus on school affairs.) (7) The departments established by schools should not be changed arbitrarily. (In the future, the departments of schools must not be changed without approval.) (8) Schools should strictly review the qualifications of students when recruiting new students, auditors, and transfer graduates to prevent fraud. (9) Schools should restrict students in the simplified teacher training courses. After the summer vacation, they must apply for approval before opening classes. (Except for the completion of the Jiangnan Township Normal School's senior student courses, which can be specially requested for flexible handling, the simplified teacher training courses should be handled by schools designated by the Department based on actual needs. Those not designated will not be allowed to continue running them, in order to show restrictions.) (10) Schools should earnestly handle moral education. (The Department has formulated a plan for the implementation of moral education in secondary schools and issued orders to all schools for effective implementation.) (11) Schools should adjust their school buildings within a possible scope. (Some schools are in noisy areas where classes cannot be held all day; some are on the side of the road, surrounded by brothels; some have small rooms and too many people, leaving no place to sit; some have many grades and few rooms, resulting in rotating classes; some schools are scattered in various places, making it difficult to concentrate. The situation is very complicated. Renting school buildings in Shanghai is originally a difficult problem, but the environment is closely related to reading and training. It is permissible to say that insufficient classrooms are the greatest obstacle to the progress of the curriculum. Schools should try to relocate and expand within a possible scope to make them suitable for reading and appropriate use.) The above items are related to school personnel, school finances, academic subjects and books, or moral education facilities, all of which need to be improved. Therefore, they are listed and circulated for immediate compliance and effective improvement, and a report on the improvement should be submitted for review.

### The Two-Year Anniversary of the Shanghai Battle: The Concessions' Defenses Become More Stringent; All National Troops Are Mobilized for Alert; Entertainment Venues Voluntarily Close for One Day; Citizens Suspend Banquets and Entertainment

Since the two concession authorities implemented joint alert measures, defenses have become extremely strict. Today marks the two-year anniversary of the Shanghai Battle, so the alert situation has become even more serious. All sectors have uniformly suspended entertainment, but no ceremonies are held. Details are as follows:

Citywide Suspension of Banquets and Entertainment

Since the two concession authorities in the city stepped up their alert for the two-year anniversary of the Shanghai Battle, order has been quite stable. Various groups in the city have no commemorative ceremonies today, but in order to express the firm belief of the city's compatriots in resisting the war and to commemorate the martyred soldiers and compatriots, it was decided that the entire city would suspend banquets and entertainment for one day today, and at noon everyone would silently mourn in their original positions.

Troops and Business Corps Deployed by District

The Public Concession authorities, in view of the tension of the "August 13th" situation, in order to strengthen police forces, from yesterday morning, all British, American, and Italian troops stationed in Shanghai were mobilized and deployed in various districts. Groups of fifteen people, armed with live ammunition, patrolled their designated defense areas. The Jing'an Temple Road area of the West District was defended by American troops, the area outside the Shanghai West Concession was defended by Italian troops, and the area east of Tibet Road to the Bund was defended by British troops. Sandbags were added and machine guns were set up in the areas outside the concession, making the situation even more tense. The entrance of the Special District Court was also guarded by British troops and detectives. As for the French Concession, all French troops stationed in Shanghai and volunteer corps were also mobilized to patrol. In addition, the International Business Corps was also fully mobilized, with a force of one regiment and three battalions, totaling about two thousand. The headquarters of the Chinese team in the regiment was located in the Business Corps barracks of the Municipal Council. The headquarters of the A Battalion, mainly composed of the British team, was located at No. 15 on the Bund. The headquarters of the B Battalion, mainly composed of the American team, was located in the Racecourse. In addition, two cavalry teams and one armored vehicle team were also attached to the Racecourse and patrolled on full alert.

Strict Guard at Newspaper Offices

In order to prevent the recurrence of incidents of attacking newspaper offices, the authorities built sandbag bunkers in front of the locations of various newspaper offices from the day before yesterday. These included: the building at No. 160, Edward Road, where the Da Wan Bao, China-America Daily, The Times, and Millard's Review were located; the Da Mei Bao at the intersection of Catholic Church Street; the Shen Bao and Xin Wen Bao offices on Sanma Road; the International Daily News at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road; the Chinese Daily News office at the corner of Henan Road and Hankou Road; and the North-China Daily News office. From yesterday morning, members of the International Business Corps were sent to guard the inside, and machine guns were set up on the bunkers. Two members of the Business Corps were also stationed in front of each newspaper office. The strictness of the defenses was unprecedented.

All Entertainment Venues Closed

All entertainment venues in the city, such as the Great World, New World, Tian Yun Lou, Sun Sun Amusement Ground, New Capital Rooftop Garden, theaters such as the Huang Jin, Da Wu Tai, Gong Wu Tai, Carlton, as well as various cinemas, bookstores, drama theaters, dance halls, etc., decided to voluntarily close for one day or two days in view of today being the two-year anniversary of the Shanghai Battle. In addition, the Gujiazhai Park in the French Concession was ordered to close today and tomorrow, and will only be reopened on the 15th.

Pedestrians Prohibited in Front of Japanese Barracks

The Municipal Council Police Department authorities, considering the special situation today, in order to avoid accidents, yesterday ordered various police stations in Shanghai West to seal off both ends of the roads in front of the Japanese army barracks at Yichang Road, Macau Road, and Binlang Road with barbed wire. Only gaps were left at both ends to allow workers from the yarn factories to pass through. If there were Japanese military vehicles coming and going, the blockade equipment would be moved at any time. Detectives were stationed at both ends of each road, and the troops stationed in Shanghai patrolled back and forth, prohibiting all pedestrians from stopping and watching.

Shortened Tram Routes on Various Roads

The Public Tram Company, following the notification from the authorities, had temporarily shortened the routes of the No. 16 trolleybus from Sanyangjing to Caojiadu, and the No. 19 and No. 21 trams from Sanyangjing Bridge to Xiaoshadu from the day before yesterday. All westbound vehicles only traveled to the Great Clock as the terminus. From the 15th, they will resume the previous routes. It is also known that Robison Road from Jiaozhou Road to the west and the surrounding area of Yaoshui Lane have been sealed off. The opening hours are temporarily set from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm every day. Yinghua Lane to the north and Xiaoshadu to the west are heavily guarded. At the same time, the No. 5, No. 6, and No. 7 trams at the North Railway Station changed their turning point in front of the First Special District Court.

Japanese Planes Reconnoitered the Suburbs and the City's Airspace

The Japanese side, considering today to be the "August 13th" anniversary, and fearing that Chinese guerrillas would take the opportunity to launch a surprise attack, in addition to stepping up alert in various occupied areas, from 8:00 am yesterday, eight Japanese planes, six in the front and two in the back, with silver bodies, circled over the city for fifteen minutes, and then flew to the suburbs of Shanghai for reconnaissance.

Japanese Plainclothes Soldiers Searched Pedestrians

From 6:00 am yesterday, Japanese soldiers in Zhabei and Hongkou sent out a large number of plainclothes teams, disguised as Chinese, some wearing Xiangyunsha short shirts and trousers, some wearing white short shirts and trousers, some wearing long gowns, and some wearing suits. Each team of four or five people was on Yangshupu Road, Broadway Road, Dixiwei Road, North Sichuan Road, Qiujiang Road, along the Suzhou River, North Suzhou Road, such as the Waibaidu Bridge facing west, Zhapu Road Bridge, and the two bridges of Xinzha and Wuzhen Road. These plainclothes soldiers were also dispatched to search. They pretended to be innocent, and if they saw pedestrians they deemed suspicious, one person would come forward from the side or behind and hug the person around the waist, quickly holding them with both hands. At the same time, several other plainclothes soldiers would swarm over, show their pistols, and conduct a search. If there were no contraband items, they would be released on the spot.

Chinese and Japanese Ships Patrol the Suzhou River

Yesterday, Japanese motorboats patrolled the Suzhou River from Waibaidu Bridge west through Lao Zha, Xin Zha, Xiaoshadu, Caojiadu, Beixin Jing, Jiangqiao, Huangdu, and Hongqiao. The bow of the boat was equipped with machine guns and wireless transmitters. Japanese soldiers with guns were standing on both sides of the boat. Each boat was assigned seven or eight soldiers and one or two Chinese police officers. A Japanese naval flag was hoisted at the stern of the boat, and the boats sped through the river all day long.

Pu River Traffic Blockaded Today

Japanese troops and puppet police in the suburbs of Shanghai have increased posts and patrols in recent days to be on alert. As for Pu River traffic, it is completely blocked today. Ferries running to Nanhuangpu, Tangkou, Wangjiadu, Zhangang, Dujiahang, Yexie, Minhang, Zhujing, and other places are all suspended. Waterway traffic upstream of the Suzhou River in Beixin Jing and Yujidun is also blocked. No ships are allowed to enter or leave, so all inland river ferries are suspended.

Alert Continues and Ends on the 15th

The joint alert implemented by the two concessions started on the morning of the 9th. Yesterday and today, it became even more tense. The alert will continue tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and is scheduled to be lifted after 12:00 pm on the 15th. However, if the situation is peaceful and no accidents occur, it is hoped that it can be shortened temporarily. As for the curfew time, even today, it will still be implemented from 12:30 am and will not be moved earlier. It is believed that the public will not go out easily, so it is expected that the market will be quieter than usual.

The Grand Shanghai Hotel Was Searched Yesterday

At 8:30 yesterday morning, the French police specially dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to the Grand Shanghai Hotel at the intersection of Dongxin Bridge on Edward Road. Then, a part of them were assigned to guard at the gate and next to the elevator, and the rest went to search the rooms on each floor. It only finished around 10:00 am. As for whether anything was found, it is not known because the police have not yet released the information.

### Security Situation in Front of This Newspaper Office

The Public Concession attaches great importance to the defense of various newspaper offices. In addition to sandbags being piled up in front of various newspaper offices along Edward Road and members of the Business Corps being sent to guard them, Wangping Street has always been a concentration of newspaper offices. This newspaper office stands at the corner of Wangping Street and Hankou Road. In this extraordinary period, it would not be safe to not strengthen the defenses. Therefore, a sandbag bunker was also set up opposite this newspaper office, and members of the Business Corps were sent to guard it. Members of the Business Corps with guns were also stationed in front of this newspaper office. The situation was very serious, and it was a rare sight on Wangping Street.

### Cotton Yarn Dark Market Suspends Operations

The Shanghai Cotton Yarn Dark Market (i.e., the Yarn Industry Association) has temporarily suspended operations from yesterday. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired from a leader of the association yesterday morning that the organization of the dark market was originally established for the needs of the cotton yarn industry. Recently, due to the manipulation of speculators, the market price has risen improperly high, and in fact there are difficulties in banning the trading of Japanese yarn in the market. Now, due to the Ministry of Economic Affairs issuing an order to stop it, as well as the manipulation of speculators and the hot weather, it has to be temporarily suspended. It will be discussed and decided after August 13th. In addition, the Miscellaneous Grain Dark Market was closed for three days from yesterday morning and will resume operations as usual from the 15th.

### Bomb Explodes in Front of Inland River Shipping Company Last Night; As Many As Ten People Injured; Police Are Investigating the Truth

The temporary alert in the city has been very strict and tense in recent days. All sections along the Suzhou River are even more closely guarded, with a post every five steps and a policeman every ten steps. This is because there are more waterways and more traffic, so special attention should be paid to it. Unexpectedly, at about 8:20 last night, a bomb explosion occurred in front of the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company at No. 424 to 434, North Foot of Henan Road Bridge. According to the investigation, no one could confirm the source of the item. When the explosion occurred, searches were conducted, but no evidence was found. At the time, as many as ten people were injured, including two women: Fang Yunqin from Jiaxing, 24 years old, injured her right foot; and Wang Zhou, an elderly woman, injured her right hand and both feet. There were also three children: Chen Danru from Ningbo, only 13 years old, injured his right hand, and the bone was broken; Li Shunming from Anhui, 12 years old, injured his abdomen; and Zhu Yaoming from Wuxi, 2 years old, injured his abdomen. The other five people were men: Wu Yongfu from Ningbo, 24 years old, injured his leg; Wang Ada from Jiangbei, 43 years old, injured his left foot; Hou Yinghao from Ningbo, 29 years old, injured his left waist; Xie Jiafu from Ningbo, 23 years old, injured his left foot, and the bone was broken; and Wang Genlai, a local, 69 years old, injured his mouth and both feet. Police officers and the Japanese police chief in charge of the area gathered after hearing the alarm and investigated the truth. At the time of publication, the search was still underway. All the injured have been sent to the hospital separately.

### Chinese Troops Advance to the Suburbs; Begin Action; Successful Liaison with the New Fourth Army; Contact in Various Places in the Western Suburbs

According to people from Baoshan yesterday, more than 10,000 elite troops from the Loyal National Salvation Army and a certain regular army unit were ordered to move from Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu and other places to Luodian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Baoshan and other places. They have established contact with the New Fourth Army and are preparing to counterattack. There have also been several small-scale contacts with the Japanese army. Therefore, clear gunshots and artillery sounds have been heard in recent days. As a result, the Japanese army is extremely panicked. Since the 10th, they have been frequently searching villages indiscriminately. Anyone who is slow to speak is deemed suspicious and arrested.

Dense Gunfire in Chengjiaqiao Village

The Shanghai Evening Post reported that yesterday (the 11th) around noon, several Chinese and foreigners on Rubicon Road took shelter because machine gun bullets whistled by nearby. It is believed that it was a battle between the Japanese army and a large guerrilla force, but it has not been confirmed by the Japanese authorities. According to eyewitnesses, the battle seemed to have taken place in Chengjiaqiao Village near Rubicon Road and the Hongqiao Golf Course. Although no guerrillas or armed Chinese were seen, it was witnessed that Japanese soldiers used machine guns and rifles to shoot at the village. Several trucks of Japanese soldiers arrived at the scene, and the shooting lasted for a long time. The Japanese soldiers then left by truck, but by evening, one or two teams of Japanese soldiers were still patrolling near the village.

One or Two Hundred Villagers Detained

Also, the Continental News reported that at 7:00 am yesterday, fifty Japanese soldiers with armored vehicles surrounded 500 residents of Chengjiaqiao. According to foreign eyewitnesses, after the shooting, no fewer than 300 residents, including women and children, were arrested by the Japanese soldiers. Several Chinese were seen lying in pools of blood. Until noon yesterday, gunshots were still heard nearby. According to unconfirmed news, eight pistols and some ammunition were found in a house in the village. According to foreign observers who spoke to reporters, the battle in Chengjiaqiao yesterday may have been a retaliatory measure taken by the Japanese side because a Japanese cavalry team of forty men was attacked by guerrillas in the Hongqiao area on Wednesday afternoon. Foreign observers saw the Japanese cavalry tired and covered in mud, dragging a light field gun back from a certain place in the Hongqiao area. The battle yesterday confirmed the widespread guerrilla activity in the vicinity of the Public Concession. In this military operation, thousands of Chinese, including farmers carrying vegetables into the Public Concession, were detained by the Japanese soldiers.

Surprise Attack on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road at Night

The Shanghai South Railway Station and Longhua areas have been closed again since the day before yesterday. However, gunshots occurred on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road in Xinlonghua the night before. From 1:00 am to 3:00 am, the gunshots were very intense, indicating a night battle between the guerrillas and the Japanese army. However, the details are unknown because of the special martial law. In addition, plainclothes teams are very active outside the highway lines of Xinzhuang, Qianbujing, Zhuanbei, and Maqiao. The Japanese army does not dare to go deep and only concentrates in the Xinzhuang Railway Station and the Beiqiao Headquarters, building fortifications around them and trying to defend to the death. They no longer pay attention to the surrounding villages and towns.

Puppet Troops in the Western Suburbs Gradually Eliminated

A unit of the 45th Independent Brigade of the Chinese regular army has been discovered in Qibao Town, equipped with steel cannons and heavy machine guns. At the same time, the puppet "Peace National Salvation Army" and the puppet "Self-Defense Corps" in the Shanghai West area have been mostly eliminated. The transportation lines from Qibao through Sijing to Zhujiajiao are all under control.

### Scottish Infantry Will Soon Be Transferred to Shanghai to Replace the East Surrey Regiment

The Shanghai Evening Post reported that after the East Surrey Regiment and the West Yorkshire Regiment of the British Army stationed in Shanghai have completed their service in Shanghai this year, they will be replaced by two battalions of Scottish infantry. This is the first time in the history of the British garrison in Shanghai. The two units that are about to arrive in Shanghai are the 1st Battalion of the Highland Light Infantry and the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Scots Regiment. At that time, Shanghai will no longer see the khaki short skirts of the West Yorkshire Regiment, because the new units are both Lowland regiments, wearing tartan trousers instead of the khaki short skirts that distinguish the Highland regiments. The Highland Light Infantry Battalion from Fort George in Scotland will replace the East Surrey Regiment. The East Surrey Regiment will leave for Hong Kong during the upcoming troop exchange season. The West Yorkshire Regiment will be transferred to India, and the Royal Scots Regiment currently stationed in Hong Kong will replace it here. It is not yet known when the two battalions will arrive in Shanghai. According to reports, the commander of the Highland Light Infantry Regiment from Fort George is Lieutenant Colonel Masson, and the commander of the Royal Scots Regiment is Lieutenant Colonel Hall.

### Stock Exchanges Not Allowed to Resume Operations Without Approval; Ministry of Economic Affairs Has Issued Order to Comply; Should Also Comply With Maintenance Measures

The Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that stock exchanges are special businesses and should be strictly supervised by the competent authorities in order to prevent manipulation and eliminate abuses. After the administrative organs withdrew from Shanghai, all stock exchanges stopped operating. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, together with the Ministry of Finance, formulated maintenance measures and implemented them effectively. Recently, there have been rumors that a certain stock exchange will resume operations, which is confusing. Therefore, the Ministry issued an order to all stock exchanges that they are not allowed to resume operations without approval. At the same time, they should still comply with the maintenance measures set by the Ministry.

### Due to the Persistence of Hoarders, the Rice Market Situation Is Serious; Smaller Rice Shops Will Have No Rice to Sell; If They Close, It Will Affect Public Security; Requesting Police Protection for Rice Shops

The rice price in Shanghai has continued to rise uncontrollably due to the persistence of hoarders who refuse to loosen their grip and the further monopolization by a small number of rice merchants. Members of the Rice Shop Industry Association have been affected by the black market, resulting in a decrease in spot goods in stores. Smaller rice shops have no goods to sell. They have all sent letters to the Industry Association requesting them to find ways to implore the authorities to ban the black market, strictly enforce price limits. The Rice Shop Association, considering the urgency, specially appointed committee members Lu Wenshao and Qu Zhenhua the other day to take letters to the Public Concession Municipal Council, the French Concession Public Works Bureau, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to find ways to provide relief, to contact and dredge sources of national rice on the eve of the new rice entering the market, so as to maintain the food supply for Shanghai citizens, and to urgently ban the black market and strictly enforce price limits. It is said that the two concession authorities have accepted this request, and the result is quite satisfactory. The association held an emergency meeting of executive supervisors at its office on Shanhaiguan Road at 5:00 pm yesterday. Qu Zhenhua, Lu Wenshao, Pan Jibin, and others attended. Chairman Lu Wenshao first reported the purpose of the meeting, then reported the results of visiting the authorities and the General Chamber of Commerce, and decided to issue another notice to strongly urge colleagues to maintain the original state. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 pm. It is heard that the black market rose again yesterday, and the price has no track to follow.

Letter Requesting Instructions and Appropriate Measures

In addition to appointing representatives to visit the authorities to seek relief the other day, the Rice Shop Industry Association also sent a letter requesting instructions and appropriate measures. The original letter said: "Respectfully, the rice price in the city is rising day by day due to the reduction of sources. The two concession authorities have jointly stipulated a price limit, with the highest white japonica rice not exceeding 20 yuan per stone in national currency, and indica rice not exceeding 16 yuan. We have decided to reduce the price accordingly. After the announcement, our association immediately notified all rice shops to strictly abide by the price limit and not to exceed it. However, the market price of japonica rice in the market exceeds the limit, and they are raising prices. Those who have goods are unwilling to sell according to the limit. Gradually, high-priced samples have disappeared. In the past few days, the black market price of japonica rice must be sold for 26 to 27 yuan, and the black market price of indica rice is also 22 yuan per stone. The market is in extreme disorder. Our association's colleagues go to the market to buy rice, and cannot buy it anywhere according to the price limit. At first, they reluctantly sacrificed and purchased supplements to meet market demand. Unexpectedly, the black market is becoming more and more intense. Each stone is actually 6 to 7 yuan different from the price limit, and the market price is sold according to the price limit. Everyone feels that the sacrifice is too great and cannot bear it, so they have stopped buying rice that exceeds the price."

Affecting Public Security, Great Responsibility

"The inventory of each rice shop is limited and will soon be sold out, and dozens of them have already sold out and have no rice to sell, and will inevitably suspend business to wait. According to the reports from various colleagues, our association believes that rice is related to the food supply of all citizens. If the rice shops close down, the people will panic. We immediately advised all colleagues to maintain the status quo and not to close down in order to maintain public security. We have found that the black market price of japonica rice is raising prices and trading beyond the limit, which has become an open secret. Rice shops need goods to meet market demand and cannot buy them anywhere according to the price limit. If they endure buying them at the black market price, each stone must exceed the price limit by 6 to 7 yuan. However, the sales price at the door follows the price limit. Where does such a huge capital come from to suffer long-term sacrifice? The situation in the rice shop industry is really difficult. If there is no rice to meet market demand and they close down one after another, a serious panic will occur. If this causes disputes and affects local public security, how can our association bear this heavy responsibility? In order to report the actual situation of the market price exceeding the limit in the black market and the fact that there is no rice to buy, we have appointed two committee members, Lu Wenshao and Qu Zhenhua, to request an audience to present everything in person. We pray that the authorities will instruct appropriate measures (and please instruct the police stations to protect the rice shops currently in business) to maintain public security. Respectfully."

Maintaining the Status Quo While Selling Noodles

The inventory of smaller rice shops throughout the city has run out, and there are no goods to sell. It is heard that some shops have temporarily suspended business, and the situation is extremely difficult. In addition to advising colleagues to maintain the status quo, the Rice Shop Association also notified colleagues to sell cut noodles and wheat flour. The notice is transcribed below: "We have found that the rice inventory in the city is decreasing day by day, and the arrival of goods is decreasing. We are now in a time when the old rice is gone and the new rice has not yet arrived. We are afraid that there will be a shortage. Therefore, we notify all colleagues that at this time when rice is scarce and it is difficult to buy goods, we can sell as much cut noodles and wheat flour as possible, which can replace food. The two concession authorities have approved exemption from licenses. Please continue to operate as usual to maintain the people's food supply."

Restaurant Prices Are Rising Again

In recent days, due to the manipulation of speculators, rice prices have soared. In addition to sending detectives to monitor the market, the French Concession is also investigating market prices, inventory, and sales figures at rice shops on a daily basis to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding. However, after the rice price has risen this time, the price of vegetables has also increased at the same time, and coal has also risen by 10% to 20% yesterday. Therefore, restaurants, food stalls, and snack shops have also announced price increases from yesterday, with varying amounts. If this continues, the livelihood of ordinary people will become even more unbearable.

### Hongkou Japanese Naval Defense Zone: Anti-Jewish Movement Begins; Executed Without Notifying the Shanghai Municipal Council, Citing "Exercise of the Right of Military Occupation"

The Continental Times reports that a Japanese naval spokesperson disclosed at a press conference yesterday (the 11th) that, beginning August 11th, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai have completely and permanently prohibited Jewish refugees from continuing to reside or do business in the Public Settlement north of the Suzhou Creek. It is said that Jewish refugees in Shanghai, those residing in the Japanese naval defense zone, those doing business in the zone, those wishing to reside in the zone, or those planning to change their businesses or move their residences, must fill out forms provided by the Jewish International Refugee Relief Committee and submit them to the Japanese naval officer's office for approval through the Relief Committee. From August 21st onward,

No Registration Allowed

Jewish refugees currently residing or doing business in Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Zhabei will be expelled if they do not have registration slips by then. Those unwilling to register will not be allowed to stay or do business in these areas. The reason for this step is that the number of Jewish refugees residing or doing business in the northern and eastern districts has increased from four thousand to five thousand, not including those in refugee shelters. The Jewish International Relief Committee has pointed out that the continued arrival of Jewish refugees in Shanghai will threaten the livelihoods of those already in Shanghai. The Committee has repeatedly expressed its hope that the continued arrival of refugees in Shanghai can be terminated, which is a constructive plan to prevent the increase in the number of refugees cared for by the Committee. Furthermore, Jewish residents in the Japanese naval defense zone have reached

One-Tenth of Japanese Residents in Shanghai

There is concern that friction may arise between the two groups. Given that Shanghai has not returned to its original state and that jobs are scarce, this temporary measure is being taken. Even Japanese coming to Shanghai from Japan are being restricted. The purpose of this measure is a temporary solution necessitated by the current situation, and because there is a need for relevant authorities to consider the wishes and views of the Refugee Committee. There is currently no other way to stop the arrival of Jewish refugees in Shanghai. The refugee control problem has been raised with the Consular Body. Although the Consular Body acknowledges the need for control, it has taken no action. The Japanese side realizes that it can implement this measure within its area. After August 21st, legitimate registration slips for Jewish refugees in these areas will be determined. Shelters

Also Require Refugee Registration

Refugees will also be prohibited from entering shelters after August 21st. When asked whether the Shanghai Municipal Council is the highest authority for deciding on such steps in the Public Settlement, the spokesperson replied that the Japanese side is the sole authority in its occupied area. This step is being taken by "exercising the right of military occupation." Although the Japanese side has notified the Consular Body, it has not received a reply. The Japanese side has neither informed nor consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Council about this measure. A reporter asked if this precedent is set, can the Japanese side expel British, American, and other third-country people from the occupied area? The spokesperson replied that the refugee problem is purely a different issue. Why did Cuba allow and then reject Jewish

Refugee Landings?

When asked whether Hongqiao would be opened for Jewish refugees to reside and do business, the spokesperson's response involved previous statements that the Hongqiao area would be opened to people from third countries, implying that Jewish refugees were also included. When asked whether the Japanese side had asked its allies to allow it to take action against Germany to alleviate the serious situation of Jewish refugees in Shanghai, the spokesperson replied no. He also said that the Japanese-occupied Chinese ports did not take restrictive measures against Jewish refugees.

### Second Adoption Campaign

The Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Citizen Group handled the fundraising and adoption of over 15,000 refugees in August, raising over 300,000 yuan. Now, in accordance with the resolution of the Association's general membership meeting to continue fundraising, the committee is preparing everything to launch the second phase of the fundraising and adoption campaign, so that the needy compatriots can be spared from freezing and starvation during this time of high prices. Donations from all walks of life can be sent directly to the Association at No. 414 Xingye Building, Jiangxi Road, or call 18533, and the Association will send someone to collect them.

### Japanese Military Police Act Stubbornly; Implement Sit-Down Strike; Deliberately Loiter in Front of British Soldiers and Get Detained; Refuse to Leave After Release; Only Led Away by Japanese Military Police After Eight Hours

The Shanghai Mercury reports that a stubborn Japanese military policeman implemented an eight-hour "sit-down strike" after being detained for five minutes yesterday (the 11th) afternoon in front of the British military barricade and police sentry post at the corner of Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road, refusing to be released in order to test the patience of the British soldiers. At 11 p.m., other Japanese military police officers, accompanied by a foreign military officer, arrived at the scene and led him away. The details are recorded below. The Japanese military policeman, an acting corporal, arrived at the site at 3:15 p.m. in front of the East Surrey Regiment British sentry, and

Deliberately Loitered

After loitering for several minutes, he was stopped by a British soldier and detained for five minutes. The British soldier told him that he was free to leave, but the Japanese military policeman refused to leave. After being assured repeatedly that he was free to leave, he still refused to leave and sat down in the management office of the fire brigade. Under the watchful eyes of the East Surrey Regiment British soldiers and the Chinese staff of the fire brigade, he was calm and composed. The British sentry could do nothing and reported to the British military headquarters. Shortly afterwards, a British military officer arrived at the scene and again made it clear to the Japanese soldier that he was

Free to Leave

However, the Japanese soldier refused again. At the same time, he got up and walked around once or twice, expressing great interest in some of the fire engines. Since the Japanese soldier had no intention of leaving, the British soldiers gave him food, which he ate with relish. At the same time, the British soldiers, due to his stubborn attitude, telephoned the Japanese military police, explaining the matter. At about 6:10 p.m., a car with the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters license plate drove to the barricade. Two Japanese military officers got out of the car and talked to the "prisoner"

For a Moment

But did not take the "prisoner" away and left on their own. At that time, the Japanese soldier seemed to intend to sit there forever. The British soldiers then called again. Finally, at 11 p.m., two Japanese military officers, accompanied by a foreign military officer, arrived at the scene. After obtaining a certificate from the Japanese military police explaining that the soldier had been detained for five minutes, they led him away. When the British soldiers telephoned the Japanese military police to try to get the soldier to leave, they summoned the soldier to talk to the Japanese military police. The British soldiers on the scene did not understand Japanese, so they did not know what he told the military police. However, since no one came to "release" him,

The Interpretation Was Probably Not Unpleasant

The license plate number of the car that took the Japanese soldier away was 12114. It drove towards Joffre Road and stopped in front of a fortified house. The house was surrounded by fortifications, and armed men guarded it. The Japanese military policeman and those who accompanied him entered the house. Afterwards, a Japanese military officer drove the car back to the Difeng Road barricade. It was explained that he was going to pick up two books left behind by his companion.

### Don't Forget This Evening VG - "The Night Before" Musings -

On a summer night, a gentle breeze fluttered a few pages of the calendar hanging on the wall. 14...15...16, 7... Because the wind was so slight, it was as if a finger had flipped them slightly, without knocking them down, and soon they returned to their original state. It seemed that everything around was as regular and still as the calendar, without any chaos. However, a metallic clatter...clatter...clatter...sound of a horn, broke through the silence. No breeze, no movement, the calendar clearly showed "August 12, Saturday..." Several numbers. Another sound of heavy wheels rolling on the road, broke through the silent air of the 12th night. "The Night Before, the Night Before,... Everyone knew which day this was the "Night Before" of.

Since the beginning of autumn, it has only been a few days. The summer heat, white clothes, frozen drinks... everything still lingers around the saturation point of "heat". Who admits that autumn has arrived? Who dares to say that the environment is improving? Opening our eyes, tilting our ears, the result of seeing or hearing is nothing more than increasing our worries and boredom. What is wriggling on the road is "people". What is sweating and panting to struggle with life is "people". What is shouting about the high price of everything, the expensiveness of rice and fuel is also "people". Rice costing nearly 30 yuan per picul, and still increasing. Gold prices are like the red line on a thermometer, rising straight up, 90 degrees passing the border, 92, 93, passing the border, passing the border, a chorus of rising prices. Shanghai's four million people seem to have all grown wings under their armpits, slowly rising to enjoy that clear, empty, and vast dream life. Since August, this kind of unbreathable, suffocating life, I am afraid that this year's August will not be easily forgotten by ordinary people!

The past has become the past, the future is still unknown, only the current situation, everyone can feel it. Shanghai, known as the isolated island, the suffering lower and middle classes seem to be forever dominated, to play this role. It is really like in a theater troupe, the one who sings the painted face, has to wear the painted face for a lifetime, stretching his throat, forcing all his strength out of his throat, which is organized like ordinary people. The audience is used to it and does not find it strange, and does not feel his pain. On the stage of life, in the crucible of Shanghai, I really don't know how many millions of people there are that people don't find "strange" to see.

However, things in the world are always relative, and there are many more things that are not "strange" to see! Although the weather is so hot that people can't move, there are still some people who criticize which cinema or which teahouse has good air conditioning; many ladies and wives, after afternoon tea, drag their light skirts, hold their handbags, and run in and out of several large companies, "desperately" doing purchasing work; as for the western district, the roads are wide, and the asphalt roads are baked soft, like asbestos in car springs, shock-absorbing, four wheels rolling on it, even if it is not lightning, it is also wind-swept. We see the "people in the car" - that is, the "dream person" that ordinary urban dwellers dream of, those wearing suits are of course straight lines and horizontal patterns, meticulous; those wearing long gowns are even wider and more comfortable, and the cool breeze directly gathers in their sleeves; women are even more pure and flawless, like ice melons and fresh fruits just taken out of the electric refrigerator, there is actually a faint cold fragrance, refreshing... Enough, enough, they are the enjoyers of summer.

Whether you feel pain yourself or someone else is holding pain for you, or you think you are comfortable and peaceful, you can't help but flip the calendar and live your life. A gentle breeze blowing on the so-called "blessed" people, also passes through the skin of the "desperate" people. Who can escape this August, this August that makes it hard to breathe?

A burst of clatter...clatter...clatter, the heavy sound of metal wheels, broke through the annoying summer night again. Everything floating in front of you is the truth, is what people feel. We can only inspect the road again, and that is even more to think that this August is indeed an uncomfortable time.

Several intersections at the border of the British and French Concessions are blocked by barbed wire, so the few passages become even more lively and tense, especially the corner of Edward Road and Yu Qiaqing Road near the Great World. You see, by evening, all kinds of people are woven into chaotic people, tides surging south, and on the other side, surging north, they are coming so hurriedly, going so hurriedly.

The police have increased a lot, they are inspecting every pedestrian very seriously and solemnly. The black mass of people surged to this place and temporarily slowed down, the other end sparsely released them, the pedestrians raised their hands to let them search at will, exhaled, and hurried forward. Some showed resentment on their faces, others smiled, thinking that it was the obligation of pedestrians at this time, anyway, they were not carrying any prohibited items, so they didn't care about being searched. The more distressed one was an old gentleman, he came trembling with several paper packages, as usual, they had to be opened, which was quite troublesome. While he was being inspected, the old man added that these were the items he bought for drinking wine, probably he had broken his vegetarian diet in June, and bought meat and fish to take back and share with his wife, the searcher saw, and indeed there was a fresh smell coming out, smiled and signaled to let him pass, the old man delayed a few minutes, I don't know what he was thinking in his heart.

The most painful ones were the women, they squeezed into the men's team to prepare to squeeze through, but were shouted by the police to turn aside, and then two female searchers came up. The first thing to check was of course the wallet, in fact there would not be anything found in it - except for handkerchiefs, powder boxes, mirrors and the like, and then they were searched all over and then released. A richly dressed girl came in a rickshaw, and only heard a female inspector ordering in a skilled and calm, tight throat: "Stop, stop," the rickshaw puller dared not delay, and slowly lowered the rickshaw pole, and let the girl move down. The female inspector inspected it again as usual, and also lifted the rickshaw cushion, but nothing was found, so she turned to inspect the second one. The girl suffered such trouble, showing resentment, twisted her body into the car, and faintly sent a "bad luck!"

I can say that all the tense situations in the Concession are giving us some stimulation, like a shot of morphine, yes, we have been too numb in the past two years - not only numb, but simply locally insensible, young people dance and watch movies, the old appreciate calligraphy and painting and sip tea morning and evening, national affairs are farther and farther away; a bit of Han has nothing to do with it. I hope that after being stimulated this time, at the very least, everyone will not be dizzy again.

Things in the world are never felt painful until they are closely related to one's own interests, take the recent rise in prices as an example, whether rich or poor, everyone has felt that it is difficult to make ends meet these days. Today I took two yellow rickshaws, a short journey that could have been done for one dime in legal tender, but the rickshaw puller said, "Rice is expensive at twenty-seven yuan a picul, sir, what am I supposed to do with this dime?" Helpless, I had to give him two dimes. The second rickshaw puller said the same thing.

Shanghai has reached a time when everyone is suffering! This is the most precious time, it is a touchstone, to see who can endure it? See who can support it? We must not forget that there is light after the darkness has passed, everyone tightens their belts, endures this difficult time, and dawn is in front of us.

I hope that next year on this day, I will no longer see these tense situations! I think, I will definitely not see them again.

### Russian Yarignik Accused of Encroaching on Property Rights; Property Dispute of the Yamon Theater

Ningbo native Yan Yiqing, 41 years old, residing at No. 1, Yong'an Lane, Blair Road, near lawyers Yan Jiangyi, Li Gengxiang, Yang Yunshi, and Ge Bangren, filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court against White Russian Yarignik (transliteration), requesting confirmation and division of jointly owned property and its profits. The reason is that the defendant, around November of the 25th year of the Republic of China, together with Russian merchant Lidov (transliteration), proposed to open

Yamon Theater

And hired the plaintiff as the Chinese manager. Lidov contributed 1,700 yuan to rent the theater site on Blair Road. While preparing, Lidov was injured and hospitalized for treatment, and funds ran out. Although the defendant was a shareholder, he really had no money to raise. In desperation, the plaintiff advanced 700 yuan in cash and managed to borrow nearly 4,000 yuan, and also issued 4,000 yuan in post-dated checks. The theater was thus established. Later, due to poor business and insufficient funds, it eventually

Announced Closure

On March 15th of the 26th year. At that time, the plaintiff entrusted a representative to contact the defendant for liquidation and managed to raise 1,000 yuan, instructing him to transfer it to creditors. A partnership dissolution contract was signed on April 1st, stipulating that the plaintiff's outstanding checks would be cleared by the defendant, and the 4,000 yuan loan would still be the responsibility of the plaintiff to repay. All the property of the Yamon Theater and various pledges would be jointly owned by both parties. The plaintiff accused the defendant of having bad intentions and unilaterally changing the contract, intending to monopolize the Yamon property. The plaintiff had accused the defendant of the crime of

Forgery

In the High Third Branch Court, but because the content was complicated and involved civil matters, the court ordered a stay of judgment and ordered a civil lawsuit to be filed first. It is found that the Yamon Theater was leased to Samsung Company on June 1st of last year, with a monthly rent of 3,600 yuan. Up to the end of July of this year, a total of 50,400 yuan was seized by the defendant. It should be confirmed that the contract stipulates that the theater property is jointly owned by both parties, and the defendant should divide the above amount in half and bear the litigation costs. The case was heard by Judge Wu yesterday. He stated that he would wait for the forgery documents to be transferred and reschedule the trial.

### Small Foreman Zhang Longshan Stabs Sworn Brother to Death; Sentenced to Four Years and Eight Months; Civil Lawsuit to Be Tried Separately

Accused Zhou of Skimming Money

And fraud, a conflict arose. At first, it was a verbal argument, and then they used force against each other. Zhang Longshan then took out a sharp knife and stabbed Zhou Yunqing in the chest, abdomen, arm, and other places. The police arrived, arrested Zhang Longshan and took him to the police station, and sent the injured Zhou Yunqing to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Zhang was then escorted to the Special No. 2 Court for interrogation and detention, pending further interrogation after the victim's recovery. However, Zhou died on the 23rd of the same month due to ineffective treatment. The police reported to the court to verify the body, which was collected by relatives for burial. The lawyer of the French Concession administrative authorities filed a

Public Prosecution Against Zhang Longshan for Injury Resulting in Death

The wife of the deceased, Zhang Shen, also commissioned a lawyer to file an incidental civil lawsuit, seeking compensation for damages, funeral expenses, and living expenses for the deceased's family and children. The defendant, Zhang Longshan, also commissioned lawyer Wu Luping to defend him. The investigation of the various circumstances has been recorded in previous reports. The case has been concluded by Judge Miao Qingbang and was judged yesterday morning. Zhang Longshan was sentenced to four years and eight months of imprisonment for causing death by injury. The incidental civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Division for trial. During the appeal period, the defendant was transferred to the detention center to await review.

### Our Reporter Qu Shao'yi Encountered Danger; Trial Opened Yesterday; Public Prosecution Filed for Attempted Murder

Lawyer Qu Yue (zi Shao'yi), a native of Pudong, lives at No. 38, Lane 16, Meibiger Road. In Shanghai, in addition to practicing law, he also serves as an editor for the Shen Bao. At around 8 a.m. on June 17th of this year, an uninvited guest suddenly visited. At this time, lawyer Qu happened to be in court for a case and was not present. At 10:30 a.m., the guest visited Qu again. Qu had returned home and came out to meet him. The guest suddenly

Later, he was arrested for being with a gang of thieves and robbing with weapons, and was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and sent to prison. He was pardoned in 1935. Later, he committed another

Robbery Case and was Arrested

In the French Concession and sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. He was sent to the Beixinjing Jiangsu Model Prison. On August 12th two years ago, because the Shanghai War broke out, he was sent to the front line by the Garrison Headquarters. Later, he retreated with the army to Nanjing and fled with the director Wang Mingde. Later, he and Wang made a living selling smuggled salt in Pudong. A few months later, they returned to Ningbo together. One day, Wang Mingde suddenly handed him a pistol and 40 yuan for boat fare, and instructed him

To Come to Shanghai from Ningbo

To assassinate lawyer Qu. After arriving in Shanghai, he first stayed in Room 34, Southeast New Hotel, Baker Road. He inquired about Qu's address and went to shoot, resulting in his arrest. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Chen Rongji to the Second Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court. The police station lawyer Wang Yaozeng prosecuted him under Article 271, Section 2 of the Criminal Law for attempted murder. The judge announced that the case was forbidden from being heard by bystanders. As a result, Chen was remanded in custody and the hearing was rescheduled.

### False Alarm of Robbery Fabricated; Houseboy Embezzles; Detailed Interrogation Reveals Truth and Results in Arrest

At 9 p.m. on the 4th of this month, the French police station received a report stating that a robbery had occurred in the residence of a certain German on Remi Road. Upon receiving the news, the police station immediately dispatched detectives to rush to the scene to catch the robbers. Unexpectedly, upon arrival, only Zhu Deyang, the houseboy of the German resident, was inside. According to Zhu, four Chinese men suddenly broke into the house, one of whom was holding a pistol. One of the thieves guarded him, while the other three began to search the rooms on the second floor. After searching for three minutes, they took the stolen goods and escaped over the wall. After the incident, the police immediately began investigating, but without results. After careful study, they felt that there were many suspicious points in everything the houseboy said, so they used their clever means to interrogate Zhu in detail. Finally, Zhu knew he had been exposed and confessed directly to stealing items from his employer and then fabricating the false alarm. The police station then detained him, preparing to send him to court for prosecution in accordance with the law.

### Japanese Construction of Airfield in Dinghai and Atrocities by Japanese Aircraft in Eastern Zhejiang Originating from There

After the Japanese forces occupied Dinghai, the residents fled, leaving the urban area desolate and with hardly any women left. However, the Japanese military deployment on the island did not slacken due to the depressed market situation. For example, the entire campus of the Dadao Primary School and the Aquatic Products School had been converted into barracks. The area facing the sea outside the Minsheng Refined Salt Company in Dongjiangpu, five miles from Dinghai County, was being rushed to construct a seaplane base, with stakes and markings all around, prohibiting any ships from approaching. There were between three and five seaplanes stationed inside the base. In addition, a land airfield covering more than ten acres had been reclaimed on the river beach opposite Qinglei Head nearby. The Japanese aircraft that had been flying to wreak havoc in eastern Zhejiang in recent days took off from this airfield.

### Letter

To the Editor,

I recently saw a news item in your newspaper stating that Lu Zhi of the French Municipal Council had been working, and his wife had committed suicide by poisoning not long ago, and Lu also committed suicide in despair. After checking, there is no such person in this bureau. It is assumed that the rumor is inaccurate. We hereby request a correction.

Sincerely,

Children's Weekly

### Today

— Yin

Today is an exceptional Sunday, worthy of deep reflection by children. Let's exceptionally dedicate only half the day to rest, and use the other half for special work.

(1) After reading this article, immediately spend a few minutes in silent contemplation, carefully reflecting on the following questions: What day is today? Why is the concession so heavily guarded? What was the situation in this city today last year, and the year before? If you were still in the mainland last year or the year before, how was the local situation different from today?

(2) After contemplating, if your mother has not yet gone to buy groceries, ask her to eat vegetarian for a day and donate the saved money to refugee relief organizations as sanitation funds. If she doesn't understand, explain the reason to her. If you have friends living with you, also encourage them to do the same; if they don't understand, tell them the reasons.

(3) Write a diary entry, recording your thoughts and feelings about today. You can also record any sights or events you witnessed regarding the situation in the isolated island today.

(4) Where did our country's former copper coins and subsidiary currencies go? Is it convenient to use stamps instead now? How can we avoid this phenomenon?

(5) Why are prices so high? Is it only because of the plummeting foreign exchange rate, or are there other reasons? Can you explain other reasons?

(6) What kind of negotiations are the UK and Japan holding in Tokyo? What is the UK's attitude? Do you think the outcome of these negotiations will be beneficial to our country? What special actions has the United States taken recently?

Children, today, this special Sunday, use your brains to think about everything of today.

### Small Science Questions

— Xi Fenghui

Why does ice give off steam? We are used to seeing steam on food, but now we suddenly see steam rising from ice, which is quite strange. In fact, after investigation, it is not surprising: Hot things emit steam because their temperature is much higher than the temperature in ordinary air, and part of the heat dissipates and turns into steam. Conversely, the temperature of cold ice is much lower than the temperature in ordinary air. The warm air around it flows to the ice, causing it to evaporate and dissolve, thus also generating a kind of vapor.

What is the filament of an electric light bulb made of?

The filament of an electric light bulb was formerly made of carbon fiber, but because its efficiency was not high, tungsten wire was later used. However, this tungsten wire will turn to ash in a few seconds when current passes through it in the air. Therefore, the air inside the bulb must be completely extracted to create a sealed vacuum. The light bulbs sold on the market now are made of tungsten wire and are all vacuum-sealed.

Why don't we see breath in the summer? Our body temperature is usually around 37 degrees Celsius, and this temperature is constant. If it changes, there must be something wrong with the body. However, the temperature in the air changes all the time depending on the climate. The temperature in winter is much lower than body temperature, so the hot air exhaled from the mouth is condensed into very tiny dew points by the cold air, so it is discovered. In summer, the temperature is very high and almost equal to body temperature, so the hot air exhaled from the mouth will not condense and cannot be seen.

### Scenery of Tunxi

— Bai Zheng

The Twenty-Ninth Record of Ming'er's Escape

The Jiangshan ship arrived in Tunxi in the hazy dawn. This was the first stage of Ming'er's escape journey. The ship could no longer navigate upstream from here, so Tunxi became the destination of the Jiangshan ship. Because the section of the water journey from Muhang to Tunxi was deep and relatively gentle, and the river surface was also wide, further upstream, the river was narrow and shallow, and the water was rapid and full of shoals, which was not conducive to navigation.

Ming'er and a group of refugees saw that the sky was already dark, and it was impossible to get a car, so they decided to spend the night on the ship. However, Ming'er had long heard the captain praise how lively Tunxi was. Today, he arrived there but could not satisfy his desire. Sitting in the cabin, he felt really uncomfortable.

Ming'er's father and Mr. Zhang and Mr. Li went out of the cabin and asked the boatman to put on the gangplank, preparing to go ashore. Ming'er wanted to take advantage of this good opportunity, but his father said to them: "You don't go ashore, we are going to contact the car to Jingdezhen tomorrow." After Ming'er waited for the three of them to go far away, he pestered his mother to let his brother go out to play with him, and after getting her permission, he happily went ashore.

As soon as Ming'er stepped ashore, rows of low mud-walled thatched houses appeared, some with toilets and some with pigsties, one after another along the shore. Fat black and white pigs were still running and shouting on the beach, looking for their food. Ming'er found it very strange that in such a dark scene, pigs were kept outside like dogs, which was not the case in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, this was a characteristic of Anhui.

Tunxi's terrain is very high. Ming'er and his brother climbed more than thirty stone steps to reach the street, which was almost as high as a two-story building. The street was very humid, and there were many shops, such as bamboo shops, restaurants, and grocery stores. Some were so dilapidated that even the faces of the people in the store could not be seen clearly because they were lit with oil lamps. Several large stores were very tidy. Although they were lit with electric lights, they were fiery red due to insufficient power, but they were much brighter after all. Ming'er muttered: "Is this kind of place worthy of being called lively?" "Then let's go back." His brother also answered him with an unhappy tone. Although Ming'er was very disappointed, he thought that the captain would not lie. "Let's go a little further, maybe it's over there." So they turned a corner and climbed more than ten stone steps. Sure enough, a wide street was in front of them. The road was paved with stone strips, and bicycles, rickshaws, and cars rushed from west to east and from east to west. The shops on the roadside were neat and clean, and the pedestrians were very busy. There were even senior military officers driving motorcycles and speeding by. Groups of soldiers, walking proudly, with bags of yellow sand placed in front of each shop, and air raid leaflets posted on the walls, clearly indicated that this place was also militarized. They walked forward a dozen steps, and there were many barber shops, the gasoline lamps in the shops emitted dazzling light to attract customers, and the pleasant radio sound attracted people's patronage. The facades were painted very brightly, obviously competing with each other. Ming'er saw the barber shop and touched his hair, which had not been cut for more than a month, so he and his brother chose a relatively clean barber shop to go in, but it was already full. After walking several shops, it took half an hour to have Ming'er's hair cut short for two dimes. He thought that he had finally left a small souvenir—hair—in Tunxi, which was very gratifying. The two of them also ate a bowl of Pian'er noodles in a Huizhou restaurant, and finally tasted the famous Anhui flavor. Then they hurried back to the ship and were reprimanded by their father: "We are fleeing from the disaster, but you are enjoying yourselves—eating noodles and getting haircuts, this doesn't look like fleeing from the disaster."

### My Hometown

— Li Xiaocen

My hometown is in Liling, Hunan. I remember one summer, my father took me on a steamer back to visit my grandmother. My grandmother saw me and her face was full of smiles. Although there were many wrinkles on her face, she looked even kinder. She gave me local specialties to eat and told me stories about local customs, which I listened to with great interest. Even now, the impression of my grandmother is still deeply etched in my mind. My hometown has green hills and clear water, a place with beautiful mountains and rivers. Indeed, although there were no tall foreign houses there, there were thatched cottages scattered everywhere, surrounded by green trees. In the hot summer, green shade filled the ground, and the gentle breeze was truly a special flavor. Moreover, on the rivers, willows shyly lowered their heads, and one or two small birds flew together, making pleasant sounds. The water in the river was clear and bottomless, and small fish often chased each other playing in the water. I went to the mountains to look into the distance, and I only felt that the rice in the fields grew so neatly, stretching endlessly to the foot of the mountains. Among them, some wildflowers were smiling and blooming. Everything on the earth truly deserved to be called a natural and beautiful painting. Ah! How poetic my hometown is! On summer mornings, a group of rural girls, with cloth bags tied around their waists, walked to the top of the mountain to pick tea. I have also tasted the taste of that tea, it is truly fragrant and refreshing, penetrating deep into the lungs. I lived there for two months, only because my school started, so I had to leave that beautiful countryside. Ah! How reluctant I was! As soon as I arrived in Shanghai, I felt exceptionally annoyed. I could only hear the sound of horses and carts and the noise of the crowd. How could the city be as good as the flavor of the countryside? Since the flames of this decisive war have filled the sky, I can no longer return to my hometown. I don't even know what the current situation is like. The hateful iron birds often come to destroy the beautiful scenery of my hometown. I only hope that God will bless my hometown, always with such vigorous vitality, always so beautiful and lovely.

This little boy scout, on sentry duty outside, it's getting dark, and he forgot the way back to camp; can you show him the way?

### Not Bathing

— Yang Lizhai

During the summer vacation, bathing is a very important thing. But there are many children, when their mother tells them to take a bath, they hide everywhere and always refuse. Children! Are you also afraid of bathing?

You must know that bathing can remove dirt and grime, cleanse the skin, and is very beneficial to our health. We humans not only breathe air with our lungs, but our skin also does the work of breathing. At the same time, it constantly emits moisture to help the kidneys excrete waste. If we let our skin get dirty without washing, then it will hinder the breathing function of the skin, and excretion will not be smooth.

When bathing, some people like to use warm water, and some people like to use cold water, this is a matter of personal habit. But don't be exposed to the wind to prevent catching a cold. You should not bathe after a full meal. It is also not advisable to bathe when you are sick or vaccinated.

Children! Keeping your body clean is most important in summer, so you should bathe once a day!

### In the Realm of Beasts (13)

— Xin Qing

Comrade Donkey's intention is to ride him on the road, and kick and beat him, everything that he had done to donkeys and horses before, he would try it on him. These methods of punishment, although they have some meaning; however, I must honestly express my opposition. Friends, everyone remember, we can never stand on an equal footing with humans, this is not my unique view, you all understand it in your hearts. Humans treat us, there is no fixed way, sometimes excessively lenient and gentle, and when they get angry, they will inevitably use cruel methods. Not only humans are like this, but also we beasts, don't we often have this kind of behavior? As for getting along with humans, when abused, we never fail to feel indignant, but once we are treated well, we immediately understand, so what is the meaning of revenge? Just ask Comrade Donkey himself, is this the case? Even under the master's kicks and beatings, doesn't he still obediently carry him on the road? As for dogs, there is no need to say more. Even if they have a very cruel master, don't they still remain very loyal to him, and do they have any hatred for their master? In the event that the master is in danger, they even forget their own lives and try to save him. My friends, we must remember that we are, after all, beasts, not humans. Although we have our own hobbies and games, cruelty is unacceptable. Dear comrades, let us understand this child's ignorance, and we don't need to treat him the way he treats us; but he is not worthy of being our friend, not worthy of being with us, so I will punish him with "deportation." Previously, several dog friends had sneaked here, and the children often tied tin cans to their tails. We might as well tie a tin can to Peng Qi's foot and drive him out of the realm of beasts."

After the lion's judgment, everyone had no objection, so they immediately carried out its words, tied a tin can to Peng Qi's heel, and prepared to drive him out. When the lion let out a long roar, all the beasts, led by Leff, all lifted their feet and ran behind Peng Qi, shouting and chasing him.

Peng Qi picked up his feet and ran for his life, running straight to the end of the moon, and jumped out of the body. Leff, the dog, also followed him and jumped. The two of them fell together in space; they passed the Big Dipper constellation, (where the ghosts of large wild animals are located) passed the Little Dipper constellation (where the ghosts of small wild animals are located) and approached the Dog Star, where all the good dogs come to die. They caught sight of two hunting dogs licking each other's noses, and then telling the old stories to a newly arrived curly-haired puppy.

### Finance: Rumors of Foreign Exchange Stabilization Measures, Sassoon and Hong Kong Release Funds in Succession, Market Sees Sudden and Fierce Rebound

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's official rates. The British and American exchange black markets, due to the lingering effects of the previous day and the sudden rumors that the Ministry of Finance had stabilization measures for the black market foreign exchange on Monday, caused anxiety among many parties. Therefore, both Chinese and Western speculators competed to take profits and exit the market. It was also heard that HSBC had released funds, so the morning opened strongly at British gold 3 1/2 8125 and American exchange 6.375. After opening, it continued to loosen to British gold 3 1/2 1/2 and American exchange 6.875. Then, due to a sudden and fierce grab by the Japanese banks, the market once tightened to British gold 3 1/2 3125 and American exchange 6.4375. After 11 AM, because Western merchant Sassoon's intention to sell resurfaced, and Hong Kong also telegraphed to release funds, the market image repeated and hardened. As a result, it closed at British gold 3 1/2 46875 and American exchange 6.75. The current month's contracts also loosened, no different from spot prices. Trading in the morning was still active.

Japanese Banks Still Taking Advantage of Low Prices

At the start of the day, London large bars of gold, both near and far term, rose by 0.0625. New York silver prices suddenly increased by half a point. London raw gold continued to be stable. The exchange rate between British and American currencies remained flat, while against Shanghai, it was down by a small 0.3125. Against France, it fell by one centime. The American currency against the British currency and against the French currency remained flat, while against Shanghai, it fell by 7.5 jiao. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was British gold 3 1/2 28125 and American exchange 6.375, which was higher than the previous close. British was up by 0.03125 and American was harder by 0.0625. After opening, people's hearts were very empty, and both Chinese and Western speculators competed to release funds. Moreover, foreign banks had unhealthy appetites, so the situation was quite loose and the situation was extremely chaotic. It is estimated that a Chinese merchant sold spot American exchange to a certain bank at 6.46875 yuan, and then sold to advantageous foreign banks such as Banque Sino-Belge spot British gold from 3 1/2 375 to 4375. Later, Chinese merchants and Chinese banks sold spot American exchange to foreign banks such as Chase Manhattan Bank from 6.46875 yuan to 625. When HSBC's official rate announcement was unchanged, and the announcement of the silver balance tax remained exempt, the situation became looser. A Chinese merchant released spot American exchange to a certain bank, hardening to 6.875 yuan, and the current month's American exchange to 6.6875 yuan. At the same time, spot British gold also loosened to 3 1/2. Then, due to a sudden and fierce grab by the Japanese banks taking advantage of the low prices, and the gradual decline in sellers, the market image tightened. It is estimated that a foreign bank released spot British gold to a Japanese bank from 3 1/2 4375, softening to 3125, and spot American exchange from 6.6875, tightening to 4375. Then, a certain bank absorbed spot British gold from a Chinese merchant at 3 1/2 34375. After that, due to Sassoon's intention to sell resurfaced, and Hong Kong also telegraphed to release funds, the potential once again hardened. It is estimated that Sassoon and Hong Kong telegraphed to successively release spot British gold to foreign banks from 3 1/2 375, growing to 46875, and spot American exchange from 6.5625, hardening to 6875. Extending to the noon close, the bank's spot selling price was British gold 3 1/2 46875 and American exchange 6.75. The current month's British gold was 3 1/2 390625 and American exchange was 6.59375. As a result, compared to the previous day, the spot and forward British gold both rebounded by 12875, and the American currency also hardened by 4375.

### Foreign Currency Profit-Taking, Small Rebound After Big Rise, Annam Tickets Alone Rise by One Jiao

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a sharp drop in local notes due to the loosening of foreign exchange. The supply of British and American gold pounds suddenly increased, and British and American gold tickets fell sharply, with no appetite for acquisition. As a result, American gold tickets once reached 14 yuan. In fact, speculators stirred up trouble, doing everything possible to manipulate the market. Those who blindly followed suffered heavy losses. Hong Kong tickets and French franc tickets both loosened due to profit-taking. Singapore tickets, Dutch tickets, etc., all trended sharply down. Only Annam tickets had demand, and they alone saw a rise. Japanese gold tickets were not affected, and the evening market was still 1 yuan and 9 li. Demand for Korean tickets gradually decreased, and the market softened, with the evening market at 9 jiao and 2 fen. There were few transactions at the association.

### City Market Takes a Turn: Gold Prices Plummet Drastically, Dropping to 4,300 Yuan – A Reaction After Seven Consecutive Days of Rise

Yesterday, the spot gold market experienced a rapid and unprecedented rise in unofficial trading, lasting for seven consecutive days, with a total increase of 1,070 yuan. However, yesterday, a sudden reversal occurred, with a drastic drop of 320 yuan. Thus, the week's fervor finally subsided yesterday. This was mainly due to the weakening sentiment already present on the evening of the previous day. Furthermore, rumors of a considerable easing of foreign exchange rates, coupled with reports that the Ministry of Finance would implement measures to stabilize foreign exchange on Monday of the following week, caused widespread panic. Selling pressure surged like a spring, driving the opening price down to 4,360 yuan. Subsequently, the price continued to decline to 4,300 yuan. However, after the foreign exchange market experienced a day of aggressive buying, it suddenly tightened, triggering a buying spree. A certain bank (acting on behalf of non-industry players) increased its bids, and a money exchange business also followed suit, actively purchasing. In addition, sellers were hesitant to sell during the rebound, leading to a significant surge, reaching as high as 4,660 yuan. Later, due to the renewed easing of foreign exchange rates, combined with the Saturday factor, many cowardly speculators rushed to exit the market. Jewelry shops and others also competed to sell short, causing the price to plummet to a low of 4,300 yuan. The market eventually closed at 4,320 yuan. Trading was still active throughout the morning, with approximately over a thousand taels traded. It was reported that the unofficial market rebounded slightly in the afternoon, with prices reaching 4,400 yuan. Jewelry shops successively changed prices eight times, ultimately decreasing by a small thirty yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stable.

Spot Gold Drops 350 Yuan

Since the morning, traders had gathered early in the market, awaiting the opening of foreign exchange trading. After 9:00 AM, news of increased foreign exchange selling caused sentiment to weaken. In an instant, selling voices filled the air, and the market became chaotic. When the market opened at 9:25 AM, prices plummeted by 310 yuan. Jewelry shops sold twenty taels to money exchange businesses at 4,360 yuan. After opening, the price weakened further by sixty yuan due to the hardening of foreign exchange rates and aggressive selling by cash houses. Cash houses sold thirty taels to a certain gold shop at 4,300 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the foreign exchange market had stopped easing and had begun to tighten, triggering a buying spree. A certain bank aggressively bought on behalf of non-industry players, and a money exchange business also competed to absorb. Sellers were hesitant to sell, and the price soared by 360 yuan. Jewelry shops sold twenty taels to money exchange businesses at 4,660 yuan, the peak price of the day. After 10:00 AM, jewelry shops took advantage of the high prices to aggressively sell, releasing hundreds of taels, causing the upward momentum to falter. Soon after, the price plummeted by 190 yuan. Jewelry shops sold thirty taels to gold shops at 4,470 yuan. The price briefly rose to 4,500 yuan. Subsequently, due to the renewed easing and hardening of foreign exchange rates, many small investors rushed to sell, and the price fell another 200 yuan. Money exchange businesses sold thirty taels to cash houses at 4,300 yuan, the low of the day. Near noon, money exchange businesses traded ten taels among themselves at 4,320 yuan, the closing price for the morning. The result was a drop of 350 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 360 yuan throughout the morning. Cash houses' quoted gold was ten yuan higher than spot gold. The current benchmark gold price was sixty-five yuan lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, few transactions were reported.

Ornamental Gold Listed Down Thirty Yuan

The initial offering price for jewelry gold from major gold shops remained at 470 yuan per tael. However, at 9:30 AM, the price fell sharply by thirty-five yuan. A moment later, it rebounded by twenty yuan, and then rose again by fifteen yuan at 10:00 AM. After 10:05 AM, the price decreased three times in a row, totaling fifteen yuan between 11:00 AM and 11:30 AM. At 12:15 PM, it decreased another five yuan. After that, there were no changes. The price ultimately decreased by thirty yuan. The revised listed price from major gold shops was 440 yuan, and the listed price from new gold shops was 438 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by twenty yuan. The exchange rate for silver was revised to 3.20 yuan by major shops and 3.10 yuan by smaller shops, an increase of three cents per tael compared to the previous listing.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Rebounds, Foreign Stock Trading Also Active

Yesterday's securities unofficial market saw a strong rebound, which can be described as a turnaround. Class A shares surged by two yuan, breaking through the 50-yuan mark. Sentiment was generally positive. Rumors of a cabinet collapse in Japan could not be confirmed. In the Tianjin Incident, Britain remained weak, offering only verbal support on the issue of maintaining the legal currency. Rumors circulated in the market about the issuance of treasury bonds, which may have been propaganda by speculators who would stop at nothing. Consequently, unofficial market prices rose significantly again, and those who followed the trend were once again exhausted. Market prices fluctuated unpredictably. Whether there is potential for continued gains in the future will depend on how the situation unfolds. Trading yesterday opened very high, with Class A shares opening at 51.40 yuan, a surge of 2.40 yuan, prompting many to exit the market, resulting in a small half-yuan decline. Defoe, Union, and many others bought in, while Gongmao, Hongda, and No. 5 also made purchases. Dingkang, Songmao, Lianyi, and Yongfeng all sold. Small investors moved in and out, blindly following the market, causing market fluctuations to intensify. As a result, shares rose by 1.30 yuan to 2 yuan. Class D shares, specifically the 96 issue that had not been traded for a long time, also saw a small number of transactions at 5.10 yuan, a drop of 8 cents compared to the previous price.

### Grains: Rice Price Rises by Around Seven Yuan Per Stone in a Week; Over Forty Boats Blocked Outside the City; Large Volume of Native Rice Traded

Nanjing Rice: After repeated surges, the market became even more intense. In the past week, prices have risen by about seven yuan. Statistics show that prices have risen by one yuan every morning. The general population has been alarmed by the daily soaring rice prices and have rushed to purchase supplies. In the past half-month, rice shops were unable to purchase goods due to price limits, resulting in depleted stocks and unusually crowded shops. To cope with the situation, they had to rely on rice firms. However, traders found that the stocks in Shanghai warehouses were limited, and the supply from Luoyang was often interrupted. In addition, the price of unhusked rice in the interior also gradually increased, creating this situation. Yesterday, it was reported that an area outside Shanghai was sealed off, blocking over forty rice boats, resulting in no delivery of goods from either river or railway. As a result, the shops were even more crowded with customers, creating an urgent need and a shortage of goods in the market. The situation became increasingly chaotic, and prices rose more sharply. Xianxi Geng was quoted at 29 yuan, but actually opened at 28.50 yuan. General Xichang, Sukun, and Su rice were quoted at 27.50 yuan to 28 yuan. Fresh Songjiang river rice opened at 26.50 yuan, Gao Wu rice opened at 24.50 yuan, and Zhongshi rice opened at 23.50 yuan and 24 yuan. Bian Yuan rice opened at 27 yuan. All prices were about 1.50 yuan higher than the previous market. Total transactions in the city were estimated at over 6,300 bags.

Native Rice: Yesterday, shop sales became increasingly greedy, and market prices continued to rise. Because today is a holiday and the market is closed, traders are rushing to buy, and although supply is cut off, native rice is still abundant in the market. As a result, 4,000 to 5,000 bags were traded yesterday. Sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, and shops rushed to buy, pushing the price of Nanjing Gao Xian to 25 yuan and Gao Wu Xian to similar levels. Zhong Jue also added to the price. All prices rose by 8 or 9 cents to 1.50 yuan compared to the previous market.

Foreign Rice: Due to unfavorable production prices, sellers used this as an excuse to raise prices. Yesterday, new Saigon rice rose to 31 yuan, which was one yuan higher than the previous day, and sellers were still unwilling to sell large quantities.

### Many Rice Shops Also Selling Flour

Flour: Yesterday, the price of No. 2 flour from the factory rose by another 20 cents, reaching 5.80 yuan in cash. Since the sharp rise in rice prices, the authorities in the concessions have allowed rice shops to sell flour products to replace rice. As a result, rice shops are stacking up flour bags. Yesterday, demand on Hong Kong Road was even more enthusiastic, but all factories refused to sell more. Customer orders were refused. It was heard that the price of returned warehouse receipts had also increased, making them more expensive than factory prices. This was due to non-industry囤積ers absorbing the goods in the market. The price of flour may reach six yuan in the near future. Today, 7,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Tanggu.

Wheat: Yesterday, the arrival of new wheat was limited due to strict security measures after August 13, which hindered supply. Holders, seeing the daily rise in rice and flour prices, hoarded their goods. Also, with the miscellaneous grains market closed, formal transactions were temporarily suspended. It was heard that one or two thousand bags were sent to factories, and the market price increased by a dime.

In addition, 1,000 bags of beans from grain products were shipped to Tianjin today, and 150 bags were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Yarn and Cotton: Speculative Market Closed, Current Yarn Trading Continues as Usual, Market Price Has Become More Calm

The Yarn Industry Association implemented a blockade yesterday, but spot transactions continued as usual. Market prices were stable, and sentiment was calm. The procedures for spot trading were more appropriate than before. Only a few people discussed prices in the yarn exchange yarn number in the Yarn and Cloth Exchange. Traders called to inquire about prices and make transactions. Another part of the brokers automatically ran to the customer to sell, and another part of the brokers actively ran to Hong Kong to sell. Another part of the needs of the actual goods directly to the yarn factory negotiations compromise, the general speculation will be the point of the gathering as its paradise to see, has been closed to see its door and not into, such as the tree collapsed 　 猻 scattered, so the nature of the transaction containing speculation, into the path of stagnation.

Yesterday's current yarn morning open, bearing the previous day's foreign exchange shrink, popularity is still strong and firm, 20 double-horse spot price is 735 yuan to 7 yuan, shepherd 425 yuan to 40 yuan, soon the bill black market lengthened, turned to flat and tired and back, double-horse spot fell to 725 yuan, warehouse receipt price of 690 yuan, fell to 680 yuan, the transaction is scarce, check the transaction side, Guang Bang buy the current yarn of three or five hundred packs, the market is fruitless and the 7th is not very different, but a part slightly fell.

### Cotton Trading Quiet

Chinese and foreign cotton trading turned quiet, the factory's acceptance of the stomach is also dim, in fact, foreign exchange lengthened, cotton yarn rose momentum also frustrated, the popularity of the gentle, the industry intention is stable, the transaction reduction, the factory only Hongzhang factory into 20 Indian cotton raw materials 400 pieces, the other no transaction, the market price tired of two or three yuan, the source of northern Jiangsu, a total of Tongzhou flower 130 packs, will be the current cotton sale of the plate recorded on the left,

Sint Pengjiapu 11.75 Hongzhang factory into 40 pieces of the bill sent to the factory

Pingguoer 114.00 into the industry 200 pieces of the dock

Tongzhou flower 120.00 and 200 packs and again

Sint flower 117.00 and 200 pieces and again

Another message Shanghai foreign cotton trading, yesterday due to speculative more multi-party settlement, exchange rate prices turned loose, converted cotton prices, cheaper than yesterday, the factory on the purchase of raw cotton in recent days, the heart is very relaxed, so yesterday's transaction is even more quiet, but only the industry slightly mind the transaction point only,

Foreign cotton prices, New York cotton first due to Liverpool to the telegram fell, more multi-party settlement and speculators dumping and announce tired, followed by the cotton price of the re-lowering, due to New Orleans帮卖出也, the later market due to the set of sales, the end of the no good, the results compared with the previous day's price, fell 78 pounds of audio, Indian transport with the prediction fell half Ruby, Egypt fell 34 pounds of audio,

### Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factory Price, Trial Sale in US Dollars, 30% of Beijing-Shanghai Dry Cocoons Confiscated, Half of Shanghai-Hangzhou Dry Cocoons Confiscated

Overseas Silk Market: Japan and the United States both rose yesterday. New York near-term rose five cents, and forward rose three cents. Spot Japanese silk rose two cents, and Chinese silk rose two to four cents. Yokohama spot rose fifteen yuan, and forward rose seventeen yuan. Lyon Japanese silk rose 1.50 francs, while Chinese silk opened at the original price.

Local Silk Market: Due to the drastic fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in recent days, silk prices have also been unpredictable. White silk factory RR sold for 3,800 yuan, while some sold for 4,000 yuan. Since some manufacturers have recently tried selling in US dollars (i.e., using US dollars as the exchange unit for selling goods), silk prices cannot be uniform. However, the inability of the silk exchange to handle large quantities of orders has become a widespread phenomenon. This is because the transport of spring cocoons to Shanghai has not yet been resolved. Previous reports indicated that 30% of fresh cocoons transported to Shanghai via the Beijing-Shanghai line would be confiscated, with 70% allowed through, while half of the cocoons transported via the Shanghai-Hangzhou line would be confiscated, with half allowed through. However, these plans have been delayed and have not yet been implemented, so silk prices in Shanghai remain firm, and no one dares to sell short.

### Green Tea Sales to Europe Improve

Yesterday, European merchants purchased more green tea, taking advantage of the recent lower prices. The sales of bud tea and Zhenmei tea were particularly active. A total of over 700 boxes of bud tea, ordinary Zhenmei, needle tea, and Xiumei tea were purchased by Xiehe, Tongfu, Jinlong, and Baochang, among others. Bud tea was sold for 320 yuan, Tongzhen was sold for 250 yuan, needle tea was sold for 85 yuan, and Xiumei tea was sold for 52 or 53 yuan. Prices were 10 to 26 yuan lower than before.

March next year was 6 shillings 1 pence 75, down 0.75, June was 6 shillings 2 pence half, down only 0.25. Sentiment was still stable.

### Piece Goods: Eastern Piece Goods and White Goods – Off-Market Trading Still Strong – National Cloth Purchasing Interest Wanes

National Cloth

The market is firm, and囤積ers have hoarded abundantly. Unless there are very cheap goods, they have no intention of continuing to purchase. Wholesale shops on Hong Kong Road handled over 100 packs of 16-pound coarse twill and various weights of coarse cloth and fine twill, over 100 boxes of woolen cloth, serge, and velvet, and dyeing factories handled over 2,000 pieces of fine twill gray cloth. The market price is still firm. Due to the shortage of coarse twill, the price has increased by 5 jiao per piece. 客路甬, 粤, and Hong Kong help have added over 100 pieces of colored twill, woolen cloth, serge, and fine twill. Overseas, Siam and Little Luzon have added over 2,000 pieces of poplin, colored twill, bleached twill, and red foreign labels. The江浙 guerrilla zone has been cut off in disguise. However, due to public anxiety and the increased demand for daily necessities, the fabric business in the local market has become increasingly depressed.

Eastern Piece Goods

After the market for white goods stopped gathering, off-market trading among industry players was still lively. 客路 and local fine cloth and fine twill spot goods continued to trade at 700 to 800 pieces. Traders are firm and bullish, buying more than selling. 12-pound horn fine cloth is currently offered at 17 yuan 5 jiao per piece, while the final price for the current stock of leading brand fine cloth is 19 yuan 1 jiao. Therefore, the market's shouting price for September goods has risen to 20 yuan 2 jiao half, and the situation is still beneficial to bulls.

Export

Exports on the 13th: 15 pieces to Hong Kong, 200 pieces to Tianjin, 120 pieces to Yantai.

### Seafood: Jinshan Shrimp Tails Continue to Rise

Although there have been no arrivals of Jinshan shrimp tails recently, the refrigerated goods here are still abundant. Currently, foreign exchange rates are frequently shrinking, so selling prices continue to rise. For example, medium-sized shrimp tails from Shangzhuang are 240 yuan, and slightly larger medium-sized shrimp tails are 215 yuan to 205 yuan. However, shipments are generally average, and prices have risen by 20 to 30 yuan compared to before, but they have not yet fully risen.

### Raw Starch "Human Spear" Discontinued, Others Rise One or Two Yuan

Raw starch trading has been active recently, but sources are scarce. For example, the "Human Spear" brand has been discontinued. Currently, the "Flying Kirin" brand is selling for 25 yuan, and the "3X" and "KG" brands are both 24 yuan. The "Double T" brand is 25 jiao, and the "Triple T" brand is 17 yuan. Prices have continued to rise by one or two yuan compared to the previous market, and the trend is quite firm.

### Medicinal Materials: Black and White Pepper Soar, Alisma Also Rises

Black and White Pepper: Foreign exchange rates are frequently tightening, and outbound shipments are continuous. Previous shipments have continued to sell out. Black pepper is priced at 75 yuan, No. 1 pepper is 76 yuan, and white pepper is 130 yuan, all in cash. Prices have risen by 3, 4, to 10 yuan compared to before.

Alisma: Recently, shipments to Hong Kong are still strong, and the market trend is firm. Previous sales included 51 pieces of Shuanghua at a cash price of 46 yuan and 61 pieces of Shuangtianhua, an increase of 6 or 7 yuan compared to before. Stocks of registered goods are scarce, sentiment is optimistic, and everyone is holding on and unwilling to sell cheaply.

### North-South Goods: Lotus Seeds from This Lake Are Expensive

Hunan lotus seeds are currently in the transition period between new and old harvests, and market stocks are very scarce, so market prices have repeatedly risen, increasing by 50 or 60 yuan in total. The market price for lotus seeds from this lake is 145 yuan. According to news from Hankou, goods are also limited, and due to transportation difficulties, there are no plans to purchase shipments to Shanghai, so the market outlook feels more stable.

### Brief Commentary on Current Peking Opera Lao Sheng Talent

— Aiping Studio Owner

There are not many outstanding talents among the current Lao Sheng (old male) actors. Aside from Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, and Yan Jupeng, who can carry a show on their own without relying on Kun Dan (female) actors, the rest lack ambition and are not making progress. If this continues, it is truly regrettable. I will now offer my humble opinions on each individual below as a form of warning.

(1) Ma Lianliang - Clear and crisp diction, sweet singing, delicate acting, and a large repertoire. He is the leading figure among current Lao Sheng actors.

(2) Tan Fuying - A loud voice and bright eyes. His singing is graceful and moving. His performances in "Dingjun Mountain" and "Battle of Taiping" are truly excellent. He still needs to work hard, and in the future, he may be able to rival Lianliang.

(3) Yan Jupeng - Profound phonetics, experienced and highly respected. He learns from Tan and creates his own style. Unfortunately, his self-created "Yan style" is not accepted by the general public. I hope he will change it.

(4) Wang Shaolou - His performance in "The Second Visit to the Palace" shows his skill, but he must work hard on his beard-dependent roles.

(5) Yang Baosen - On stage, he is calm and composed, and his acting style is pure and natural. He follows the style of his uncle, Yan. It is a pity that he sometimes seems lax and should pay more attention to it.

(6) Xi Xiaobo - His art follows Ma Lianliang, Yan Jupeng, and Yan. His dialogue is clear and distinct, and his singing is round and melodious. Aside from his short stature, which he cannot change, if he could work diligently on his vocal exercises to make his voice louder and pay more attention to martial arts, it would not be difficult for him to occupy a place among the Lao Sheng actors.

(7) Wang Fengqing - He is getting more energetic with age, ensuring that the legacy of Da Tou (Gui Fen) will not be lost. It is fortunate for the opera world.

(8) Shi Huishi - He has returned to the stage and, together with Wang Fengqing, is carrying forward the old melodies.

(9) Tan Xiaopei - It is hoped that he can also focus on performing, in addition to teaching his son. This is a rough summary of the nine people mentioned above. Due to my limited knowledge, limited materials, and limited space, Chen Shaolin, Wang Wenyuan, Guan Shaohua, Zhou Xiaotian, Jia Shaotang, Li Shengzao, and others must be omitted.

Random Notes on Artists

### Miss Chen Yunshang Talks About: Experiences and Hopes (Part 2)

— Recorded by Leng Fang

Regarding Hua Mulan

Last winter, I was invited to Shanghai by Mr. Zhang Shankun to make films. My first film, "Mulan Joins the Army," was fortunate enough to receive many extravagant compliments. I feel very ashamed because the success of "Mulan Joins the Army" was not due to my good acting, but entirely due to the good script, good director, and good actors in general. In other words, it was the general audience's sympathy for Hua Mulan, this patriotic daughter, that allowed me to enjoy such undeserved praise.

A Comparative View of Hong Kong and Shanghai

Having come from Hong Kong to Shanghai, my observations on the film industry in both places are as follows: In terms of material resources, Shanghai's film industry, known as the Hollywood of the East, is undoubtedly much more substantial and complete than that of Hong Kong. Similarly, filmmaking work here is taken more seriously than in Hong Kong. The film industry in South China is, undeniably, a little behind Shanghai due to its shorter history. However, on the whole, they are also very hardworking, and there are many excellent productions like those in Shanghai. Although there are uneven levels of competence among colleagues, and some people do not treat it as a career and only make low-brow and unhealthy films, that is only a small and localized situation.

Greatest Hope

Regarding the concept of film, no matter how hard the filmmaking work is day and night, I will never feel the slightest bit of fatigue because my interest is so strong. I feel infinitely excited every time I go to the studio. When I hear that there are no films to be made for a long time, I feel very bored. As for my future hopes, I would like to work hard for a long time so that I can go to Hollywood to make films one day, which would fulfill my greatest wish. Whether or not this ideal of mine can be realized in the future is, of course, unpredictable. However, I think back to how I was initially fascinated by the life on the silver screen and stepped into the Hong Kong film industry. Then, after making films in Hong Kong for several years, I wanted to take it a step further and make films in Shanghai, gradually realizing my ideal. Those experiences are not the same? Therefore, whether or not I can fulfill my wish is another question, but under my active efforts, this is the only clear and unwavering goal that I have identified in my career! (The End)

### Brief News from the Art World

The Shanghai Drama Society's second play after "Night Shanghai" is "Sinking Abyss," directed by Wu Tian. It is scheduled to premiere on the evening of the 17th.

There are many rumors about what the China-France Drama Society will do after the "lifting of martial law" in the concession: one says they will invite Wang Xianqi, Sun Min, and others to help, because he has performed in many plays in Chongqing, and picking one to rehearse would allow them to put on a show quickly; another says they will form a new troupe. What will Feng Zhizhong's "clever plan" ultimately be? We'll see.

Hong Kong's Great Earth Company's "Paradise in the Isolated Island" is said to contain a lot of ironic satire that the "people in Night Shanghai" find laughable and infuriating.

Li Pingqian's new work after "Yu Yin's World," "The Sorrow of Life and Death," is the same as "It's Hard for My Little Sister," starring Ding Ziming from the Shenzhou Film Company. Our Mr. Wan Laitian added the "Ding Ji" label at that time.

Chen Kengran's next film will also be a period drama. The title cannot be announced yet, but it is not the rumored "Killing the Family by Fishing," but a new type of period drama.

"Theater Arts" issue number 9 is a special issue for Chekhov's 35th anniversary and has rich content.

### The Foolish Grandpa and the Thieving Granny

— Qi Hua

"Kid From Kokomo"

The story of "The Foolish Grandpa and the Thieving Granny" goes like this: A boxing manager wants to hire a young farmer as a boxer. The young farmer refuses to leave his hometown because his mother abandoned the family many years ago and he firmly believes that she will return. The boxing manager then finds an old woman with a history of theft and a love of alcohol to impersonate the young farmer's mother; and drags out an inexplicably foolish old man to complete this absurd and comical farce.

Pan Deaobulin's boxing manager, cunning and resourceful, with everything planned out, represents a certain type of parasite in a capitalist country, and his performance is steady. Mei Laubosun's thieving granny demonstrated her supreme acting skills here (she rarely had the opportunity to act before). She gave the audience a deep impression of two distinct personalities, a rogue old woman and a pretentious loving mother, without any ambiguity.

There were two very wonderful scenes in the performance: (1) When a young couple introduced their parents to each other, Marian's father turned out to be the judge who had interrogated the "thieving granny." This comical scene was handled very lively and interestingly. (2) The boxing manager and the boxer were tied up, and the "foolish grandpa" shouted from a high place, leading the "little brothers" to fight. It was extremely lively. The director everywhere seized on small gags to strengthen the atmosphere of the farce.

This play was staged on the weekend, just as the advertisement said: "Giving the ladies and gentlemen a chance to laugh heartily." But the situation on the streets was just the opposite!

Explanation of Opening Method, Game 56

In the previous game, Cannon 8 advances 4 to pressure the chariot and gain the initiative, but in this game, Cannon 8 advances 4 loses the initiative. This is because the situation is different and the positions are different. According to the method of Cannon 8 advancing 4 to pressure the chariot, this is not an official move in the Screen Horse opening. This kind of opportunity to pressure the chariot is created by the opponent's decision of whether or not to extend the chariot. However, one must also examine the position and situation at any time. At this time, although the opponent has not extended the chariot, one cannot pressure the chariot, otherwise one will lose the initiative. The diagram can serve as a lesson.
