Editorial

### Opening of the Yangtze River and the Adjustment of Japanese-American Relations

Regarding the Japanese army's reopening of the lower Yangtze River traffic, the Japanese government issued an announcement yesterday. And formally notified the relevant countries in Europe and the United States. It indicates that it is prepared to lift the Yangtze River navigation ban below Nanjing, retaining the necessary restrictions to maintain public order and combat; when the preparation work can be completed, and what the so-called restrictions will be, of course, cannot be speculated before Japan has announced it. The Yangtze River navigation issue is the biggest dispute between Japan and the European and American countries after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The relevant countries have lodged many protests to Japan, but they have not been resolved satisfactorily! Now she suddenly announced that she is going to prepare to open the lower Yangtze River traffic, which has its own great intentions. However, since the release of this news, it has not caused a major reaction in countries such as Britain and the United States; that is, overseas Chinese businessmen in various countries, in addition to feeling skeptical, do not express pleasure. It can be seen that Japan's real intention is not difficult to be thoroughly understood by international people.

Japanese public opinion generally believes that the Japanese government's move is a huge sacrifice. For example, the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun strongly opposed it last week, saying that the opening of the Yangtze River will make all kinds of efforts made by Japan since the Sino-Japanese War come to naught. It also wrote yesterday that if this proposal still cannot ease relations with third countries, Nomura should resign to thank the people of the country; it shows that they attach great importance to the impact of this matter on Japan. Since invading the Yangtze River basin, Japan has organized various industrial and commercial societies in an attempt to monopolize the Yangtze River shipping industry, monopolize Yangtze River trade, so as to plunder all economic resources in the region; but the facts cannot make her wish come true; how can Japan's military power be allocated to such a large Yangtze River region; even the several large cities along the Yangtze River occupied by Japan, various industries and commerce have never returned to normal activities. Japan's so-called revitalization plan cannot be realized due to lack of funds and military conditions. Therefore, Japan's blockade of the Yangtze River traffic has not obtained the huge benefits it expected; even if Japan does not block it, it may not be possible for third countries to engage in normal trade. Japan claims how significant its sacrifices are in this announcement to prepare to restore traffic in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which is an exaggeration; its real intention is nothing more than to take this opportunity to obtain a larger exchange price. If third countries cannot satisfy her desires, the subsequent opening may be far away; even if Japan can obtain a considerable price and implement the opening, it must be no different from the Pearl River navigation. To achieve free navigation and trade, it fundamentally depends on Japan abandoning aggression or the complete failure of aggression.

According to Japanese official opinion, this announcement to prepare to open the lower Yangtze River seems to be entirely to adjust diplomatic relations with the United States, so as to continue to obtain arms supplies and avoid the United States taking economic retaliation policies, so she has to find a way to make friends with the United States and hope to conclude a new commercial treaty. But based on factual observations, the relationship is not only with the United States, so this is also Japan's way to adjust the entire diplomacy. Originally, in the past China's shipping industry, the power of Britain was the greatest: if the Yangtze River navigation is restored, it should be the most beneficial to Britain. This very clearly shows that Japan's purpose is also to contact Britain and France and want to obtain a considerable price from Britain and France. Not long ago, the Japanese ship Sanyou Maru returned home fully loaded with German goods from the British blockade, as well as the recent progress in the British-Japanese Tianjin negotiations. There is no trace of a spider's web to be found here. In addition, she can also use this to show that Japan's relationship with countries such as Britain and the United States is gradually improving; she can also use this posture to force the Soviet Union to improve its attitude towards Japan, which is another side effect.

Even in terms of Japan's attempt to ease Japanese-American relations, it can be seen that her superficiality is boring: among the repeated protests of the United States against Japan, it has already clearly pointed out that Japan has undermined the Nine-Power Treaty, then how can simply lifting the navigation ban on a short section of the lower Yangtze River represent the opening of China's door? From a utilitarian point of view, before the Sino-Japanese War, American ships entering and leaving Chinese ports accounted for only 2%; and almost no American commercial ships sailed on the Yangtze River. Therefore, opening the lower Yangtze River can be said to have absolutely nothing to do with the United States in terms of the shipping industry itself. In terms of commercial rights: What trade can be conducted in only a section of the Yangtze River waterway below Nanjing! None of the important products on the Yangtze River Delta is under Japan's exclusive control and sales; if items such as wharf equipment and inland transportation are not intended to be used by third countries, what is the difference between this and the ports in North China that have never been blocked; then what is the so-called opening? This is a huge question. How can foreign merchants have the freedom of shipping trade in the Pearl River, which has been open for a long time in practice! What benefits will the United States gain from opening traffic in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in this state?

However, Japan's hope of preparing to open the lower Yangtze River is too extravagant: she even hopes that the United States will continue to sign the US-Japan commercial treaty because of this move by Japan, and correct the American people's interpretation of the "New Order in East Asia"; not only is she demanding that the United States unconditionally continue to supply her with war materials to invade China, but also wants the United States to recognize her lifting of the Yangtze River navigation ban as a legitimate action, indirectly acknowledging her so-called "New Order in China." This kind of lifting of the navigation ban, which is almost a counter-demand, will only cause the United States to continue to lose greater rights and interests in China, and it is tantamount to making the United States sign and acknowledge and abandon major rights and interests forever. Such a superficial and boring attempt. It is firmly believed that it is not acceptable to the American government and the public.

### Japanese-American Negotiations Will Be Conducted Simultaneously in the Two Capitals; Japanese Ambassador Horiuchi Will Meet with Hull; No Guarantee Yet Offered on the Opening of the Yangtze River

Washington: After reviewing the contents of the third meeting between Nomura and Grew, the US State Department plans to issue new instructions to Ambassador Grew to continue negotiations. Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horiuchi also plans to meet with Secretary of State Hull in Washington on the 20th or 21st to supplement the Nomura-Grew talks. Therefore, Japanese-American negotiations seem to be proceeding in both Tokyo and Washington. According to the observations of the general public here, since Japan intends to open a part of the Yangtze River, the biggest obstacle between the two countries can be removed. Within this year, the two sides can reach an understanding and the possibility of concluding a new US-Japan commercial treaty and resolving various problems is quite high. (19th Domei dispatch)

Washington: Secretary of State Hull answered questions from reporters at the press conference yesterday, saying that Japan only expressed its intention to open the Yangtze River, and did not offer concrete guarantees and methods. Hull also said that he had not yet completed the study of the report of US Ambassador to Japan Grew. (20th United Press dispatch)

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura reported to the cabinet yesterday on the situation of his meeting with US Ambassador Grew and the plan to open part of the Yangtze River. Political figures summarized the results of the US-Japan negotiations as follows: (1) Japan's preparation to open the Yangtze River and the Pearl River has clearly recognized the rights of third countries in China; (2) Japan hopes that the United States can at least agree to a temporary commercial treaty for the transitional period after the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty; (3) Japan also recognizes the rights of Britain. Regarding the Tianjin and currency issues, concessions must be made; (4) Britain and the United States have already established contact with the "New Order," so the issue of Britain and the United States recognizing the new situation created by the Sino-Japanese War is not important. (20th Reuter dispatch)

Tokyo: It has been learned here that in addition to preparing for the conditional opening of the Yangtze River, the Japanese government also intends to abolish the ban on Pearl River navigation. According to the Japanese side, due to "military necessity," it blocked the Pearl River on December 17 last year, prohibiting navigation by third countries. It is now heard that the effective period of this ban will last until the end of this year. (20th Reuters dispatch)

New York: According to reliable news on the 19th, a high-ranking official of the State Department made an informal report to a representative of a powerful commercial organization operated by Americans in New York, saying that: (1) Even if the US-Japan commercial treaty expires on January 26, the State Department does not expect that US-Japan commercial relations will undergo major changes immediately;

(2) Because US-Japan negotiations are proceeding as they are now, the State Department does not intend to seek any measures that would hinder US-Japan trade, even if the old treaty expires, before a new treaty is established. (19th Domei dispatch)

London: A spokesman for the British Foreign Office declared yesterday that Japan had notified the British government that Japan was prepared to open the Yangtze River, but did not mention the opening date and other details. The spokesman also said that he had not received notification of the content of the talks between British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura this week. (20th United Press dispatch)

New York: The New York Democratic Times commented on the Japanese government's plan to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China, saying, "This plan is only a superficial concession to the dissatisfaction of the United States. However, it is welcome that Japan has expressed its willingness to compromise. In short, this concession, though of a secondary nature, is sufficient to prove that the attitude of the Japanese military is no longer as tough as it used to be." (20th Havas dispatch)

### Wang Zhengting Meets with the President of the Philippines

Manila - Dr. Wang Zhengting, former Chinese Ambassador to the United States and currently Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Communications here, met today with Philippine President Quezon. It is reported that the discussion centered on the Philippines' plan to reclaim foreign-owned retail businesses for domestic operation. According to Quezon, this plan will be implemented gradually, and will not significantly hinder the current status of foreign retailers. Furthermore, it is essential that the retail industry in the Philippines be placed in Filipino hands. It is reported that Chinese merchants currently control approximately 80% of the retail businesses in the Philippines. (United Press, 20th)

### U.S. Undersecretary of State Discusses U.S.-Cuba Relations

Washington - Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech on October 21, touching upon the relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland. He stated, "Cuba and the Republic of the Philippines have sought independence from the United States for years, but have not yet achieved their wishes. Therefore, the relationship between Finland and the Soviet Union is far better than the relationship between the United States and Cuba and the Philippines." U.S. Secretary of State Welles attended a banquet of the Cuban Chamber of Commerce in New York last night and delivered a speech in response to Molotov, stating, "In my opinion, the relationship between the United States and Cuba is far better than the relationship between Finland and the Soviet Union. I believe no one will disagree with this statement. I also believe that when Molotov delivered his speech, the Soviet government was undoubtedly using all its power and in its own way, to guarantee freedom and independence for Finland. Molotov had no time to look elsewhere, and therefore does not know that the Cuban people and government are completely free and independent, no less so than any other country. This is a fact known to the world." He then touched upon the self-sinking of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee," saying, "The republics of the Americas are eager to enjoy security, which is an indelible and extremely legitimate right. However, the various incidents that have occurred in recent days prove that the European belligerents disregard the rights demanded by the American countries. As you know, the governments of the Americas are currently exchanging views and will certainly decide quickly on various measures to ensure that interference with the legitimate rights of these countries does not happen again." (Havas, 20th)

### Professor Emerson of the United States Discusses Japan's Current Expansionist Policy. Japan Covets the Resources of Various Colonies in the South Seas. The Dutch East Indies Are in Danger of Being the First to Be Invaded.

Washington - Professor Emerson of political science at Harvard University recently wrote a special article for the Foreign Policy Research Association, discussing in detail whether Japan has expansionist ambitions in the South Seas. He stated, "In terms of North Asia, the general feeling is that another war between the Soviet Union and Japan is inevitable. However, the Soviet Union not only has the preparation to defend its territory, but also the ability to do so. Furthermore, Siberia has a harsh climate and its resources are not easily developed, so Japan has no firm determination to seize it. The opposite is true of the various colonies in the South Seas. Their natural resources, such as rubber, tin, oil, sugar, and other items, have become the world's main raw materials. These raw materials can not only be used by Japan itself, but also the surplus can be sold in the world market to obtain the foreign exchange that Japan needs. Furthermore, the various colonies in the South Seas can also serve as a market for Japanese goods, and their vast undeveloped lands can not only be developed by Japan, but also be used for Japanese immigration. Therefore, in many ways, the South Seas are more beneficial to Japan than China itself. Not only can their products supplement Japan's deficiencies, but geographically they hold the key to communication between Europe and Asia, which can greatly increase Japan's position in the world. The first place that Japan will attack will be the Dutch East Indies, because from the Japanese perspective, most of the Dutch East Indies is undeveloped and sparsely populated, and cannot be developed solely by its own economic strength. Therefore, Japan believes that expansion into the South Seas is necessary for Japan." Emerson continued, "The Dutch East Indies, under Dutch control, is of great benefit to the British Empire. Its importance is the same as the independence of the Netherlands and the position of Britain in Europe. Although the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan has expired, if necessary, Germany and Japan will still cooperate remotely and support each other. Germany will attack the Netherlands, and Japan will attack the Dutch East Indies." Emerson then discussed the position of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands in the South Seas, stating: (1) Although Singapore is an ideal naval base, it is difficult to threaten Japan's main force without the support of capital ships and other vessels, and it is also difficult to prevent Japan's attack on the Dutch East Indies from eastern and northern Java, and it is difficult to prevent Japan's attack on Annam. (2) However, Britain's plan to strengthen Singapore's defenses with the assistance of Australia is being actively promoted. Factories, food, ammunition, and aircraft are all being produced in large quantities in Australia to strengthen Singapore's defenses. (3) The strengthening of the artillery emplacements at the port of Qui Nhon in Annam, and the addition of aircraft factories and armories, are all intended to strengthen Annam's defenses. (4) As for the Netherlands, it is also trying to expand in the East Indies, and does not waste resources on fluid defense plans, the purpose of which is to restrain the enemy, so that the enemy cannot launch a quick decision, so that Britain, France, or the United States can provide timely assistance. (5) The British and French Far East armies recently decided at a meeting in Singapore to fight side by side in the Far East. The naval and air bases of the two countries in the Far East can be mutually used. As for the United States, if Japan attacks the Philippines, the United States will regard it as a challenge to the United States. If Japan takes a more cunning approach, temporarily not attacking the Philippines but attacking other places, it is difficult to know what attitude the United States will take. However, if the United States is neutral, its neutrality will also be beneficial to Britain and France. Furthermore, if the U.S. Navy is stationed permanently in the Far East, Japan will have to be cautious in its future actions. Discussing the difficulties of Japan's southward expansion plan, Professor Emerson stated that although Japan's strategic position is now better than before, if Japan takes action in the South Seas, its lines of communication will be further extended, and occupying new territories will certainly not be easy. Secondly, war expenses will inevitably increase further. Thirdly, the troops stationed within China and on the Manchurian border must be transferred to China. Fourthly, Japan's fleet will inevitably be dispersed, and its home country will be in a less defended position. Fifthly, Japan's merchant fleet will inevitably disappear at sea. Therefore, Japan's major policy is a policy of gradual nibbling, rather than a whole devouring. (United Press, 20th)

### Philippine Gold Production

Manila - The Philippine gold mining industry began 30 years ago, but production was not significant. It was not until 7 years ago that active reorganization began, and the value of production exceeded 10 million pesos (Philippine currency). Since then, it has increased year by year, especially this year. Although the overall gold production report for November of this year has not yet been fully released, it is expected that the value of gold production in November will be 6.4 million pesos. Based on the production volume for the 11 months of this year, it has reached 66 million pesos. It is expected that the total production value for 1939 will be between 73 million and 74 million pesos, an increase of about 9 million or 10 million pesos compared to last year's figures.

### Unable to Break Through the Blockade, German Giant Mail Ship Sinks Itself. The Columbus Has a Displacement of 32,000 Tons. All 500 Crew Members Were Rescued by U.S. Warships.

Washington - The German mail ship "Columbus," with a displacement of 32,565 tons, sailed from Veracruz, Mexico, on the 13th of this month, carrying 20,000 barrels of crude oil, attempting to break through the naval blockade of Britain and France. However, it was still pursued by a British warship. In order to avoid being captured, the German ship scuttled itself at 10:00 PM GMT tonight in the ocean 300 miles northeast of Cape Henry, Virginia. This is the twenty-second time a German ship has scuttled itself. At that time, the U.S. cruiser "Tuscaloosa" happened to be patrolling nearby and immediately rescued the German crew. Generally speaking, the British warship began to intercept the "Columbus" after sailing out of the "neutral zone" of the American continent. This is the first time Britain has de facto recognized the existence of the neutral zone, and the White House is quite satisfied. (Havas, 19th)

London - The Admiralty announced today that the German mail ship "Columbus" (32,000 tons) was spotted by a British warship about 400 miles north of Bermuda and immediately set itself on fire. The crew members all left the ship and left it to burn. The ship is the largest mail ship owned by the North German Lloyd and joined the route in 1922, traveling back and forth across the Atlantic. According to news from Washington, all crew members have been rescued. The U.S. cruiser "Tuscaloosa" was nearby. According to the ship's report, a total of 579 German crew members escaped, of which about 400 were rescued by the U.S. ship and sent to New York. The New York immigration authorities announced today that if the investigating committee confirms that all the escaped crew members are genuine sailors, they will be allowed to stay in the United States for 60 days and will be treated the same as sailors from any other country. If any crew members are found to be naval personnel or spies, they will be detained and dealt with separately. It is reported that the "Columbus" is still floating on the sea, and the fire has not been extinguished. The U.S. Navy has broadcast a warning, urging all ships to pay attention, saying that the German ship and its 22 lifeboats are now floating on the sea and are all dangerous to navigation. The position of the German ship is said to be 500 miles southwest by west of New York. (Reuters, 20th)

London - After the German transatlantic mail ship "Columbus" scuttled itself, the number of German ships that have scuttled themselves to avoid capture has reached 23, with a total tonnage of approximately 140,000 tons. As for the German ships captured by the Allied countries, there are a total of 19, with 88,000 tons. (Reuters, 20th)

New York - The "New York Times" received a telegram from Hamilton, Bermuda, today, saying that the interception of the German mail ship "Columbus" was due to the proper handling of the commander of the West Indies Naval Station, who, after receiving news of the ship, immediately ordered a destroyer to be dispatched and gave detailed instructions on the route to follow. As a result, the German ship was eventually intercepted. The ship scuttled itself after seeing that capture could not be avoided. (Reuters, 20th)

Mexico City - Regarding the sinking of the mail ship "Columbus," well-informed sources here recently announced that the ship had been hiding in Veracruz, Mexico, for almost two months. The crew members took the opportunity to load goods and food, and slaughtered and froze fresh fish and livestock for long-term food. In the two weeks before departure, two trucks loaded with food were transported from Mexico City to Veracruz every day. Part of the cargo price, 25,000 pesos, was supplied by German expatriates. Many non-German crew members, including Chinese and Spanish, gradually withdrew hundreds of days before the start because they did not want to share the fate of the German ship. Until the 13th of this month, the shipowner ordered the anchor to be raised, attempting to break through the British and French naval blockade and sail to Trieste, Italy. It was eventually intercepted by a British warship and scuttled itself. (Havas, 20th)

### Captain of the Admiral Graf Spee Commits Suicide for His Country. His Will Still Cherishes His Comrades, Saying That He Had Long Resolved to Die with the Ship.

Langsdorff also had a will, which stated that he had long resolved to die with his ship, but wanted to find a safe place for his thousands of comrades, so he deliberately delayed his life. When Captain Langsdorff arrived here on Sunday, a reporter from the U.S. Associated Press interviewed him. According to Langsdorff, "I am satisfied. I have saved all my comrades to a safe place. I have nothing else to say. I am old and have not had a moment of peace since last night. Please forgive me, I won't talk too much." The general opinion here is that Langsdorff scuttled his ship on the orders of Berlin, which drew severe criticism from the British and French newspapers, so he regretted it and committed suicide. (United Press, 20th)

The soldiers on the ship will be detained in the countryside, but will be allowed to enjoy certain freedoms. (Reuters, 20th)

London - According to New York radio, Captain Langsdorff of the German pocket battleship "Spee," which was scuttled outside the port of Montevideo, said to guests that the German ship had repeatedly changed its name during its attacks on British ships, so it was considered "the German battleship 'Deutschland' or 'Admiral Scheer', giving people the impression that three German pocket battleships were engaged in attacks in the same area."

Finance Minister Reynaud also explained that the development of the war is difficult to predict, so it is not easy to determine in advance how much the total amount of defense expenditures will be. This is why the wartime budget is set for a period of three months. As for the entire wartime budget for 1940, it is estimated that it will reach as much as 255 billion francs, of which military expenditures for the three departments of the navy, army, and air force and the Department of Munitions will account for more than 245 billion francs. In addition to regular income, the shortfall in all expenditures will be financed by raising bonds.

Paris - The Joint Meeting of the Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France discussed the issue of how to effectively provide material assistance to Finland. The most important thing they focused on was what the British and French governments would do if Norway and Sweden were drawn into the vortex of war.

### Rumor of Soviet Battleship "October Revolution" Sunk by Finnish Fortifications; Definite Assertions, but Verification Remains Difficult

Helsinki – The Soviet battleship "October Revolution" (displacement 23,370 tons) is rumored to have been sunk by Finnish fortifications. Although this has not been officially confirmed, informed sources here claim that the Soviet naval authorities were aware that Finnish fortifications had artillery emplacements with a range of only five kilometers. Therefore, their warships usually anchored beyond that range. However, they were unaware that the Finns had secretly installed large-caliber guns with a range of up to six kilometers. Therefore, it is quite possible that the Soviet warship was sunk. The "October Revolution" was built in 1911 and completely modernized in 1926. It belongs to the same class as the other three Soviet battleships, "Poltava," "Petropavlovsk," and "Sevastopol," and is equipped with twelve 12-inch guns, making it one of the most important warships in the Soviet fleet. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### Two Major British Politicians Advocate Aiding China; British Far East Policy Not Expected to Change; Soviet Feelings Towards China Should Not Be Ignored

Chongqing – The Central Daily News today published an article detailing the conversations between Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, and British First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, and former British Prime Minister Lloyd George during Sun's visit to London. It is said that Sun heard Churchill's broadcast in London and felt that his views were similar to those expressed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek.

Churchill replied that Britain's war against Germany and China's war of resistance against Japan had the same purpose, which was to resist aggression. Churchill and Lloyd George both criticized the British government's policies in recent years, believing that the current European situation was the result of appeasement policies. Both major politicians advocated aiding China. General public opinion in Britain believes that there will be no changes in British Far East policy. European newspapers pay close attention to news from the Soviet Union. Not only do they disclose more, but they also print it in the most prominent positions. The Soviet Union's interest in and sympathy for China should not be ignored. Sun Ke also told the Central Daily News that Britain is now adopting a long-term war strategy, and its goals and slogans are very similar to those that China has been advocating in its two years of war against Japan. In his opinion, the position of small and weak countries in Europe in the war is very difficult. Only by realizing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People can the slaughter of mankind finally come to an end. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

### Random Notes on a Trip East (Second Letter)

— Zhang Changren

5.  Ji'an of Xiang-Zhe Bridge and Liang

Ji'an is located in the middle reaches of the Gan River, 216 kilometers north of Nanchang and 209 kilometers south of Ganxian. It has long been known as an important city in central Jiangxi. After the fall of Nanchang, Ji'an became the hub of Jiangxi's highway transportation and the Gan River waterway. Its importance is no less than that of Hengyang in Hunan. Those traveling between Zhejiang and Hunan provinces regard this place as a bridge on the southeast shortcut. Southwestern merchants consider this place as the main route to trade in the southeast. Although the military and political center of Jiangxi is not in Ji'an, it plays a significant role economically. Goods needed in northern Jiangxi and Hunan-Guangxi are distributed from here. The commercial center is located in the Yongsu Road area on the east bank of the Gan River. It has been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, but it is rebuilt after each bombing and still maintains its modern urban style. It can still rival the major cities of various southwestern provinces. After 4 p.m., the stores open one after another, with 70-80% being department stores. Daily necessities from Ningbo and Wenzhou ports are transported here in various colors and in large quantities. Prices are about 20-30% lower than in other southwestern regions. Leather products are even only half the price of Guilin (Ji'an produces cowhide, and finished yellow and black leather sells for 45-50 cents per square foot, while in Guilin, it costs at least one yuan, and in Sichuan and Guizhou, it costs even more). Gasoline costs more than 30 yuan per bottle (more than 40 yuan in Hengyang and more than 50 yuan in Guilin). Most of the goods in the stores have not been evacuated. The city streets are expanding, but fire lanes have not yet been opened. If Japanese aircraft come again to wreak havoc, the losses will be huge. The Jiangxi authorities should strengthen evacuation, and Ji'an merchants should also plan ahead for their own sake.

Ji'an has three large-scale newspapers (Jiangxi): Minguo Daily, Mingchi Daily, and Qianfang Daily, and three small-scale newspapers: Jiebao, Dazhong Daily, and Kangzhan Daily. All are printed on local paper. Minguo Daily is run by the Jiangxi Provincial Government and has a wider circulation. Mingchi Daily is the second, and Qianfang Daily is the worst. Among the small newspapers, Jiebao has a better format and content. Its rival seems to be Dazhong Daily. In general, small newspapers seem to be more lively than large newspapers and have a tendency to seek progress. With the current population of Ji'an, three or two newspapers are enough to supply the needs. It seems unnecessary for six newspapers to be published in one place. (Later, the reporter traveled to various places in central and eastern Jiangxi, and only Xingguo had "Dajia's Newspaper" (octavo), and Ningdu had Lianhe Daily. (Large newspapers do not have news receiving equipment and reprint news from Ji'an newspapers every day. Qianxian Daily in Shangrao has a wide circulation in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces and will not be discussed.) If they can be distributed to various places, the newspapers can exert greater power than they do now.

6. Visiting Xiong Shihui

On the morning of November 20, I took a bus from Ji'an to ×× to visit Xiong Shihui, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government. I was granted an audience. According to the conversation, "Jiangxi Province has a total of 83 counties, of which Pengze, Hukou, Jiujiang, Ruichang, Xingzi, Zongan, Wuning, Yongxiu, Anyi, Jing'an, Fengxin, Nanchang, and 13 other counties have been occupied. However, county administration has not been abolished, and the people's armed forces are still developing and growing. There are currently tens of thousands of self-defense forces, assisting guerrillas and advancing teams in the occupied areas. In terms of finance, the annual income before the war was about 40 million yuan, and now it is only 30 million yuan. We are striving to reduce expenditures, and the income and expenditure are still sufficient. Education expenses account for one-fifteenth of the total expenditure, with an annual fee of 2 million yuan. Because Jiangxi Province does not yet have institutions of higher learning, we are planning to establish Zhongzheng University in a certain place in southern Jiangxi, with an estimated annual expenditure of 400,000 yuan, with departments of liberal arts, law, agriculture, and engineering. It is expected to open in the spring of next year. In terms of transportation, only the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway remains in the province. Highway transportation is being maintained with great effort amidst busy military transportation. Currently, there are scheduled buses running daily on the Gan-Xiang, Ji-(An)-Gan (Xian), Ji-Ning (Du), Gan-Ying (Tan), and Gan-Min lines, for renting and travel. The Construction Department has also established a wartime trade department, equipped with ×× trucks for transporting goods, regularly exporting local products such as rice and tea, and importing daily necessities for merchants. Commodity regulation is still active. There are currently 60,000 refugees in the province, who are being relieved by the provincial government and engaged in farming and handicrafts in various counties in southern Jiangxi. Their lives are gradually being resolved. Timber is a major export product of Jiangxi Province. Taking Suichuan County as an example, it used to reach 2 million yuan per year. Now, due to the impact of the war, it has not been exported for nine years, and the losses are considerable. However, the forest has gained this considerable time of 'protection,' and what has been lost in the past can be regained in the future.'"

7. The Winding Line of Ningdu

From Ji'an to eastern Zhejiang, one could originally take a highway through Linchuan to Dongxiang, connecting with the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. This summer, because the Japanese army in Nanchang attempted to advance southward, the railway was deliberately destroyed, and it was rerouted south from Ji'an, passing through Taihe and Xingguo, winding through Ningdu, and heading north through Guangchang, Nanfeng, Nancheng, and Jinxi to reach the Yingtan Station of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, twice the distance of the original route. On the morning of November 24, I took a ×× bus from Ji'an to Ningdu. At around 9 a.m., we passed Taihe, the east bank of the Gan River, and reached Xingguo County via Guanchao, Huilong Temple, and Laoyingpan (132 kilometers). A section of the roadbed is lower than the surrounding fields, causing flooding in this rainy season, and the road surface is easily damaged. There are road construction workers and piles of bricks, stones, and yellow soil along the way. Because of the lack of guidance, they only cut the decaying grass on the roadside and ignore the ruts on the road surface. The car can only travel at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour. The loss of cars, gasoline, and time is great. The valley of Laoyingpan is dozens of miles long. The car revolves in it, and the beautiful scenery of maple, bamboo, pine, and fir trees assaults the senses. There is often the feeling of "doubting there is no road ahead when the mountains and rivers are exhausted, but finding a new village with bright flowers and willows." The villages are mostly dilapidated, and even the residents are very poor. Although it is a paradise, it does not seem to be a blessed place on earth.

Xingguo is a small town in the hills, with the unique cleanliness of various counties in Jiangxi. The No. × Rehabilitation Hospital of the Ministry of Military Affairs is located here, with more than 2,000 war-wounded soldiers. Under the leadership of the county magistrate, they are divided into groups to form cooperatives for leather making, printing, sock making, gauze, straw shoes, and tailoring. The wounded and disabled soldiers are all dressed in blue cloth, with the name of the group and the red and white cloth characters of the number attached. The reporter met a soldier from Henan who had participated in the Battle of Shanghai. He was missing a finger and is now a leather worker, receiving the salary of a first-class soldier. According to him, the food here is cheaper and life is peaceful, but he regrets not being able to continue killing ×. They get along with the residents like family members and are also respectful to the leather making teacher (originally a leather worker), treating him with the etiquette of a disciple.

From Xingguo to Ningdu, it is 106 kilometers, of which 50 kilometers from Jiangbeidong and Guanyin'ao to Yinkeng is a newly opened road line. The Pan Road project on Guanyin'ao Mountain, which is hundreds of feet high, has not yet been completed. Hundreds of workers are continuing to open mountains and fill valleys. After Yinkeng, it turns into the main road between Ganxian and ×Tan, arriving in Ningdu at about 5 p.m. (238 kilometers between Ji'an and Ningdu, the bus fare is 13.1 yuan). Ningdu is adjacent to Ruijin and was the center of the red area in the past. The population has decreased sharply after the war, and the damage to houses is not very great. Because it is located in the transportation hub of inland Jiangxi Province, the Commissioner's Office of the ×th District is located here. There are many new houses being built, but most of the merchants are not natives.

8. The Tale of Nanfeng Oranges

The 224 kilometers between Ningdu and Yingtan, only the roadbed of the new line between Nancheng and Yingtan is not solid. The road is muddy on rainy days, and the vehicles were in danger three times, but the entire journey was completed in one day.

Guangchang was the site of a battle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. On the walls of the villages, slogans such as "Commemorate May 1st • Seize the Central City," "Education • Nurturing • Health," and "The War of Resistance Will Surely Win, and National Construction Will Surely Succeed" can still be seen, which are enough to represent the three major stages of China in the past ten years.

Lunch was in Nanfeng. Near the bus station, orange vendors lined up in the market. You can buy 13 kilograms for one yuan. Nanfeng oranges are small, have few seeds, thin skin, and sweet taste. They are a famous product of Jiangxi. The orange sellers said that most farmers in Nanfeng grow oranges, and the best ones are from Guo Bei Garden. The best varieties come from the areas of Shuinan, Yaopu, and Shishan. The rest are inferior. Eight orange trees are planted per mu (the remaining space can still be used to grow vegetables, etc.). They bear fruit after five years, but the fruits from trees aged ten to twenty-five years are the best. Trees aged thirty to forty years are mostly decayed and do not produce good fruit. Harvesting can begin after the beginning of winter each year, and late-maturing varieties can be harvested until January of the following year. The county produces about 70,000 kilograms annually, but there are good and bad harvests. Last year, only 70% was harvested, while this year there was a full harvest. Next year, there will be another poor harvest. The main market is Nanchang. Fruit merchants from Nanchang come here every year to purchase and manipulate the market price, and the farmers can do nothing about it. This year, because there is less exploitation by middlemen, the price is higher. Although the sales are smaller, the farmers can make a profit. It costs 10 yuan to transport Nanfeng oranges to Yingtan and 20 yuan to Ganxian per dan.

Yingtan is the terminal for passenger and freight transport on the western end of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. It is a small town in Guixi County. It has met the right time and the market is booming, making it almost unrecognizable to those who passed by here half a year ago. The town is widening streets, and new houses are being built near the railway station and bus station. Before the houses are completed, they are snatched up for rent, mostly by transportation companies, numbering no less than a hundred. The rest are hotels, newspapers, and restaurants.

### High Rice Prices in Dinghai Due to Japanese Military Control

Dinghai Correspondence: The rice produced in this county every year is not enough for the residents of the entire county for half a year. Since the fall of the county seat, the transportation between Ningbo and Dinghai has been cut off, and the supply of food from outside is scarce. Moreover, due to the strong control imposed by the Japanese side and the manipulation and monopoly of unscrupulous merchants, rice prices have continued to rise. White glutinous rice costs 23.5 yuan per dan, creating an unprecedented record in the county. Sweet potato shreds, a staple food, have also skyrocketed in price due to controlled transportation and sales, making it difficult for civilians to make a living, and complaints are rife. Furthermore, the Shenjiamen Town in the county was previously short of food and had returned to Shanghai to purchase 450 shi of poor-quality rice loaded on the Japanese ship Huazhong Maru to be transported to Shenjiamen for relief. Unexpectedly, the ship sank due to overloading, and the batch of rice was completely buried in the belly of the fish. The food problem for the people is extremely serious. Recently, residents have been starving to death from time to time. The Dachentou Xieyuan Rice Store was suddenly surrounded and robbed by more than 20 poor people while it was transporting rice the other day. The situation was serious, beyond description.

### Couple's Knowledge: Only a Healthy Man Deserves to Talk About Love

— Co-authored by American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei and Venereal Disease Specialist Physician Zhan Nianceng

(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, the intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road

(Time) 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., closed on Sundays

Love is a flower in a healthy life. The healthier the body, the more beautiful the flower. "Only a healthy man deserves to talk about love"! This is a motto that every young man should keep in mind. It is like a weak and incompetent man talking about love, which is equal to asking for trouble! A man should be healthy, majestic, and full of energy, loved by women and loved by his wife and concubines. Why are they now weak and incompetent, and fall into the hell on earth! ? According to medical judgment: Most of them are caused by early romance, not knowing how to love themselves, having bad habits of masturbation, or homosexuality, or nocturnal emission without treatment, or early marriage and indulgence, or polygamy and licentiousness, or worrying and injuring, etc., which depleted the secretions in the gonads (ie semen) of the source of life. Therefore, all symptoms such as brain failure and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, headache and distension, tinnitus and dizziness, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, kidney deficiency and lack of children, and premature aging are not enough. This kind of weak man is often outwardly strong and inwardly empty, or even has a yellow and thin face, and is depressed. Not only is it difficult to study and difficult to find a job, there is a danger of dropping out of school and unemployment; even between men and women, wanting to talk about love is often abandoned by women and fall into unrequited love! In the married life after marriage, it will be difficult for the wife to be satisfied and difficult to be happy forever. From this, the quarrels and quarrels between husband and wife, private communication and elopement, divorce and suicide and other tragedies are not also often heard? Or even because the above-mentioned symptoms are not treated, leading to a short-lived death, leaving behind orphans and widows, that is really tragic! Since love is a flower in a healthy life, it should be used to promote health. If licentiousness and indulgence are harmful to health, it must not be. However, if you accidentally suffer from one or all of the above-mentioned symptoms due to ignorance in the past, you should have a thorough cure as soon as possible.

According to world-famous doctors and our many years of experience, the most effective treatment is to take a preparation of male and strong animal gonadal hormones, "Gonadotropin". Because this agent has the most precious quality and the most effective efficacy, it cannot be achieved by any similar agent. It can produce semen and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation within 24 hours after taking it. Continuous taking will further promote development, nourish nerves, and must cure all symptoms in a short period of time. Regular taking in winter and spring will prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those with nocturnal emission should also take the special medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Hemitots' Spermatogenesis Pills" (all major pharmacies in China and the West sell them for 2 yuan per box. Be sure to identify the words Hemitots when purchasing) to consolidate the essence and stop nocturnal emission, then the effect will be quick!

The patient Sheng Zhiqiang, from Guangdong, is 28 years old and an importer and exporter. Due to early marriage and new injuries, he suffered from nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation. Sometimes he was even impotent and unable to lift, and his brain and kidney were severely damaged. He had taken various patent medicines on the market, but none of them worked, so his life was boring! Last month, he was introduced to our clinic for treatment by his friend. After detailed observation of his condition, he asked him to buy three dozen "Gonadotropins" and one dozen "Hemitots' Spermatogenesis Pills" and take them at the same time, and used electrotherapy injections and other methods. After more than a month, all his diseases suddenly disappeared, his weight increased by five pounds, his energy was abundant, and the love between husband and wife was even better than after the wedding!

Beauty

### Your Breasts Control Your Destiny!

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Life is not arranged by fate, beauty is enough to boast, look at the women with big breasts and fat buttocks, most of them are rich ladies.

There is no need to deny that no matter how honest and honest a man is, if he sees a beautiful and touching woman, he will also stare at her, feeling an inexplicable love in his heart. The reason why beautiful women are so precious and worthy of people's love must be attributed to the pair of breasts in front of their chests, because a woman's breasts are like the spire on a glass tower. Without it, no matter how delicate and exquisite the tower body is, it always feels out of shape. A woman who does not have towering breasts undulating in front of her chest, even if she has the beauty of Xizi and Wang Qiang, will only be called a "morbid beauty", not valued by men of the times, and will not be blessed to be the mistress of a new family, let alone hope to be a rich lady. Therefore, young women in Europe and the United States now pay attention to the development of the breast part instead of wasting unnecessary cosmetic funds on beauty. They regard the breasts as a second life. If there is any atrophy, they will immediately use German "Female Gonadotropin" to save it. The main reason for breast atrophy is that the ovarian function is destroyed by leucorrhea, dysmenorrhea, masturbation, anemia, malnutrition, and weak multiparity, which affects the metabolism. Therefore, the most effective treatment is to take female "Gonadotropin", the ovarian preparation of male and strong animals, which is the most reliable. This agent has been proven by major Chinese and Western doctors to be peaceful in nature and great in efficacy. It can be taken regularly regardless of cold or heat. If it is continued to be taken around the winter solstice, it will be even more effective. It can not only make the atrophied breasts gradually towering, but also adjust menstruation, increase body temperature, strengthen metabolism, generate a large number of new cells, make the skin smooth, the complexion ruddy, and youth will last forever.

### Supplementation Therapy for Nocturnal Emission

— Venereal Disease Specialist Physician Zhan Nianceng

Nocturnal emission is not a disease, but it will kill you in the long run! Especially during this winter season, the so-called "If you don't store essence in winter, you will be sick in spring." Although nocturnal emission is not a serious disease, it is extremely dangerous! Because the semen in our body is the so-called secretion of the gonads. This secretion is the main gland that dominates our health, temperament, reproduction, development, and life. Therefore, a person with sufficient essence must be healthy, enthusiastic, and enterprising, and is also an ideal partner for women. Married life is truly infinitely happy! However, ignorant youths often do not know the value of semen. Every time they are sexually impulsive or induced by a bad environment, they have bad habits of masturbation, or early marriage and indulgence, which destroys the sexual nerves. After the sperm barrier is relaxed, nocturnal emission must follow. Smart youths may be aware of it, and on the one hand, they must give up bad habits such as masturbation and indulgence, and on the other hand, they must find a way to cure their nocturnal emission; however, most confused youths do not consider it a disease because nocturnal emission is painless and itchy, and blindly follow the old ways without treatment. When the developmental function stagnates, the metabolism decreases, and symptoms such as brain failure and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, and local smallness like fingers break out, it is inevitable that they will harm themselves and others! In the world, there are many youths who suffer from the above-mentioned diseases, resulting in failure to study, failure to learn skills, failure to find love, and in married life after marriage, because the wife is dissatisfied, there are quarrels and discord, private communication and elopement, divorce, suicide and other tragedies!

According to my many years of experience, the only way to treat nocturnal emission is to quickly take the special medicine "Hemitots' Spermatogenesis Pills" to consolidate the sperm barrier and calm the nerves, so that you can receive the magical effect of sleeping peacefully and stopping nocturnal emission that night. Mild cases can be cured by taking it continuously for several days. However, those who have had nocturnal emission for a long time and have the above-mentioned symptoms of deficiency, in addition to actively taking "Hemitots' Spermatogenesis Pills", must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhi Zi" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Regular taking in winter and spring will cure all symptoms and improve health. If patients can come to our clinic for new therapies such as electrotherapy injections, we can guarantee a cure.

### The Public Works Department Will Not Concede on the Issue of Police Power for Road Construction Beyond the Border. A Formal Reply Has Been Sent to the Pseudo-Municipal Government. The Italian Concession Expresses That the Situation Can Be Expected to Be Clarified.

The information office of the Public Works Department released news yesterday (February 10) saying that the Public Works Department has replied to the suggestions made by the "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an regarding the issue of police power for road construction beyond the border. The reply was delivered to Fu last night (the 19th).

The Italian and Japanese Consuls Accompanied

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post said that the Chairman of the Public Works Department, F.C. Maitland, and the General Manager and President, F.J. Ferry, visited "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an at Fu's residence last night (the 19th), accompanied by the Italian Consul General and Senior Consul of Shanghai, Niloni, and the Japanese Consul General, Miura, and delivered the Public Works Department's reply to Fu's proposal regarding the issue of police affairs for road construction beyond the border. When the reporter asked Fu about the Public Works Department's reply, Fu claimed that he had not yet studied the full text of the Public Works Department's reply, so he refused to make any comments.

Resolutely Reject Joint Patrols

According to informed sources in diplomatic circles last night, the Bureau's reply rejected without hesitation the Pseudo-Municipal Government's suggestion that the Pseudo-Police and Concession Constables jointly patrol the road construction sections beyond the border. It also denied the Pseudo-Municipal Government's right to tax road construction beyond the border, which would further increase the financial difficulties of the Public Works Department.

An Agreement May Be Hoped For

Furthermore, according to Senior Consul Naroni's opinion on the future of the negotiations, a decision has been made to reach an agreement, so there is no doubt that this issue can be clarified at an early date. A senior official of the Police Station said that the issue of police power is undoubtedly the key point of the dispute. A member of the Finance Committee said that the mention of donations and taxes in the reply was indeed superfluous.

### Bureau of Public Works Rewards Patrolmen for Their Efforts, Braving Great Dangers While Remaining Calm

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department, having obtained approval from the board, awarded a First Class Medal for Special Police Merit to Chinese Constable No. 1895. Additionally, Second Class Medals were awarded to Chinese Constables Nos. 570, 1580, and 2919, as well as Indian Constable No. 459. The reason for this was that a large group of over twenty rioters, armed with hand grenades and Mauser rifles, attacked a certain location. After the incident, they split into two groups and fled. At that time, Chinese Constable No. 1895 happened to be on plainclothes duty at the entrance of an alley. Upon hearing the gunfire, he realized the gravity of the situation and immediately, together with Chinese Constable No. 2919, bravely pursued the rioters. One of the rioters threw a hand grenade, and his accomplices opened fire. Chinese Constable No. 1895 was injured in the face and legs by shrapnel, but he still blew his whistle to summon nearby constables. He then attempted to climb onto a trolleybus, but was unable to do so due to excessive blood loss. When a large number of police officers arrived at the scene, he lay in the middle of the road, loading his gun and frantically blowing his police whistle, while waving his plainclothes patrolman's badge to signal approaching officers. The Police Department's Awards Committee noted that despite the constable's young age and short service, he was able to bravely and loyally perform his duty, and even after being injured, he remained calm and composed, which was especially commendable and worthy of emulation. Therefore, he should be awarded a First Class Medal for Special Police Merit to encourage others. Chinese Constables Nos. 570, 1580, and 2919 all assisted in the aforementioned terrorist incident.

When Chinese Constable No. 570 saw a large group of armed rioters, he immediately took up his gun and fired six shots. The rioters threw a hand grenade at him, but it did not explode. At that time, the other rioters, scattering in all directions, opened fire indiscriminately. The constable still bravely pursued them westward. Chinese Constable No. 1580 heard the shots and followed in pursuit. Unexpectedly, as the rioters fled north, fearing interception by the constable, they threw another hand grenade. The constable sought cover and, after the rioters passed by, he re-emerged and opened fire. As a result, one of the criminals was hit, but he himself sustained serious leg injuries. Chinese Constable No. 2919 had previously fired two shots at the rioters and managed to evade the hand grenade explosion. Afterwards, he fired two more shots, but due to the flying bullets, he was unable to capture the rioters. The Police Department's Awards Committee deemed that each of these Chinese constables had faced great danger and fulfilled their duties, and were therefore eligible for the Second Class Medal for Special Police Merit. Furthermore, on the evening of October 20th of this year, Indian Constable No. 459 was directing traffic at the intersection of Edinburgh Road and Yu Yuen Road when he was suddenly attacked by a group of armed criminals. The criminals first grappled with the constable, then fired a shot at him, which missed. They then fired another shot, and the bullet entered his chest. The criminals fled in all directions, continuing to fire their guns. After being injured, the constable was unable to pursue the criminals, so he blew his whistle to raise the alarm, while still leaning on the lamppost,

directing traffic and resisting the criminals, preventing his pistol from being seized. This was truly courageous and greatly admired by the public and his colleagues in the Police Department. The Police Department's Awards Committee, having obtained approval from above, awarded him a Second Class Medal for Special Police Merit to encourage him.

### Japan Indicates No Definite Date for Opening Lower Yangtze; Foreign Media Express Skepticism; Restrictions Vary by Port

Last night, a Japanese spokesman in Shanghai stated at a press briefing: "The Japanese government has announced the opening of the Lower Yangtze for commercial use, and this is now an irreversible policy. However, the continued removal of restrictions on other occupied areas will depend on the attitude of third countries' reactions. Since the Japanese government announced the opening of the Yangtze on the 18th, foreign media have expressed much skepticism, criticizing the ambiguity of the opening date as a 'verbal promise without substance.' This attitude is a misunderstanding of Japan and will have a negative impact on Japanese public opinion. Japan is now sincerely seeking to re-establish normal relations with third countries in the occupied areas of China. The commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy in Central China share this view and have proposed opening the Yangtze River basin, from Jiangyin to Nanjing, as the 'real' military situation in this area has ended and it is suitable for commercial use." When a foreign reporter asked, "When will foreign ships be able to sail on the Lower Yangtze?" The spokesman did not give any definite indication. Regarding the

trade restrictions that the Japanese side has mentioned, the spokesman also stated that he was unaware of the specifics, but indicated that "each port has its own situation, and there will be different restrictions accordingly, depending on the needs of the local Japanese military for imports and exports." Regarding inquiries about the opening of the Pearl River, the spokesman replied, "This will depend on the decision of the Japanese military authorities in the Philippines." A reporter asked, "The dissatisfaction of the foreign media with

this matter stems from the ambiguous wording of the Japanese statement. What is your opinion?" The spokesman replied, "Regarding the opening of the Yangtze, there are no clear regulations in place, so the statement cannot be vague. However, the Japanese military has done its best to improve everything in the Yangtze River basin, so we feel that the opening is a matter to be considered."

### Food Regulation Association Holds Board Meeting, Exchanges Views, Advocates Cautious Handling, Yu Qiaqing Plans Meeting, Rice Dealers Receive Warning Letter

After the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Food Regulation Association, regarding the matter of banks advancing funds to order foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai for relief, Yu Qiaqing and others invited industry leaders to decide on a fundraising method. Yesterday at noon, the association held its first board meeting at the Hong Kong Road Bankers Club. Yu Qiaqing, Huang Yanfang, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, Wang Yuqing, Zhang Jiguang, Jiang Yiping, Zhang Nianxuan, Wu Yunqi, Li Wenjie, Lu Gaoyi, and others attended. Chairman Yu Qiaqing reported on the process of inviting industry leaders to raise funds for ordering foreign rice. Then, the attendees exchanged views on how to regulate the food supply. The meeting lasted a long time. It is understood that all parties believe that this matter should be handled with caution, so yesterday they only exchanged views and made no concrete decisions. The selection of executive directors and the association's organizational charter were also not discussed. It is also understood that Mr. Yu Qiaqing plans to invite industry leaders for further talks within the next few days before proceeding with everything.

Situation of Rice Shops in the

Extra-Settlement Area

The area around the Great Western Road, Jessfield Road, and Siccawei in the western part of Shanghai, since the rice riots, rice shops have felt frightened and intended to close and stop business, and move the rice to deeper places to hide. Although the panic has subsided, the shops are still afraid and not operating normally. They only put a small amount of indica rice in the rice boxes on the counters for retail sale, barely meeting the market demand, until the rice boxes are empty. Currently, the environment in that area is special. Due to the lack of real security, no one dares to purchase rice, so at present, although the rice industry in Shanghai has largely returned to normal,

all the rice shops have received warnings.

It is also heard that the important rice shops in the city received the same letter successively on the day before yesterday and yesterday. The general content advises each to be honest in business, not to speculate, and to use a portion to help the refugees.

### Affordable Daily Necessities, Purchasing Shanghai and Hong Kong Domestic Goods, Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders Crackdown on Hoarding, Funds Allocated by Four Banks for Purchase and Sales

The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to crack down on the hoarding of daily necessities and at the same time stipulate affordable purchase and sales methods, has promulgated specific measures and ordered the provincial governments and local chambers of commerce to comply. Emphasis is placed on exploring and purchasing Shanghai and Hong Kong domestic goods. Shanghai businesses can refer to the following excerpts:

For factories producing daily necessities, it should investigate their production capacity, costs, inventory quantity, and their latest selling prices. Article 4 states that after the Ministry of Economic Affairs conducts the investigation in accordance with the previous article, it may, in accordance with Article 15 of the Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Emergency Period, stipulate fair prices for each designated item based on the local supply and demand situation, encourage merchants to sell at the stipulated prices, and order them to register the quantity of inventory.

The types will be designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs from time to time.

Its organizational charter will be formulated separately. Article 4 states that the operating funds of the purchase and sales office will be allocated in installments by the joint office of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank (hereinafter referred to as the four-bank joint office) according to actual needs.

(4) The wholesale and retail prices should be stable and avoid drastic changes, and should not follow market price fluctuations to seek unreasonable profits. Article 8 states that the daily necessities purchased and transported by the purchase and sales office, except for agricultural products, should be limited to the products of factories, handicrafts, local products, and the products of domestic goods manufacturers in Hong Kong and Shanghai that originally existed in or were relocated to the rear. However, when necessary, it may entrust the purchase of items that are allowed to use foreign exchange or apply for special permission to purchase daily necessities that are prohibited from import. The purchase and transport amount of the aforementioned rear industrial products, handicrafts, and local products should account for at least 20% of the total amount in the first six months, and then increase by 10% every six months, with the standard of reaching 50% or more of the total purchase and transport amount.

Article 11 states that the public and private business institutions entrusted by the purchase and sales office to purchase and sell goods should estimate the quantity of goods to be imported based on the needs of various places, request operating funds, and be responsible for allocating the imported goods in accordance with the above estimate and directly wholesale them to retailers.

Article 13 states that daily necessities should be sold directly to consumers and should not be retailed through intermediaries. The retail price of the daily necessities in the previous article should not exceed 20% of the wholesale cost. The purchase and sales office or the entrusted public and private business institutions should invite the local chamber of commerce to negotiate with the relevant industry associations to determine and announce the retail price, and report it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the four-bank joint office for record.

### Japanese Repairing Sihang Warehouse, Opening a Puppet Market

The Sihang Warehouse at the northern end of the Tibet Road bridge has been occupied by the Japanese since the brave defenders retreated from the position two years ago. Recently, in order to control the supply of vegetables and preserved goods in Shanghai, the Japanese have been extensively repairing the warehouse and building several wooden sheds in the rubble field behind the warehouse, similar in style to the "fish market" in Yangtzepoo. The Japanese soldiers in the sentry boxes, originally one, have now increased to two. When this construction project is completed, the citizens of Shanghai will inevitably feel the increased pressure on their lives due to the strict control of vegetables.

### Japanese Navy Detains Anping Steamer, Releases After Inspection, Insists the Ship Was Carrying Rice for Export, Inspection Yields Nothing

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reports that the Japanese naval authorities in charge at the former Water Front Hotel on the Bund released the steamer *Anping* (transliteration) this morning (the 20th). The Japanese detained the ship yesterday afternoon (the 19th) because they suspected the ship was carrying rice out of Shanghai. The same day, naval infantry soldiers inspected the cargo on the *Anping* last night but found no rice. The Japanese authorities then allowed the ship to continue its voyage this morning.

Sailing the Yangtze

The *Shanghai Times* reports that the *Anping*, an 87-foot vessel belonging to the Ying Hui Ji (transliteration) shipping company at 59 Jiangxi Road, was detained by the Japanese naval infantry authorities at 10:30 am yesterday (the 19th) for cargo inspection. The ship is currently being held off the Water Front Hotel on the Bund. According to sources, the *Anping* sails between Shanghai and ports along the Yangtze River, arriving at the Bund approximately every three days.

Preparing to Unload

On the 15th of this month, the ship sailed from the No. 3 pontoon on the Bund and arrived at Lujiazui in Pudong, where it was intercepted by the Japanese authorities for cargo inspection. Before the inspection was completed, the ship weighed anchor yesterday morning (the 19th) and sailed back to the Bund, intending to unload cargo. The Shanghai Municipal Council Revenue Office had not received notification of the *Anping*'s detention and sent the ship along the No. 15 pontoon.

Suddenly Detained

As the ship approached the No. 4 anchorage outside the pontoon, preparing to moor, Japanese soldiers arrived in a motorboat, boarded the *Anping*, and forced it to dock at the Japanese-controlled Water Front Hotel. It is said that the *Anping* was detained for cargo inspection and could not return to the Bund without permission because it was suspected of carrying rice.

Inspecting Cargo

However, the shipowner has an export manifest listing the cargo as cigarettes, dates, preserved meats, etc., but no rice. All goods have been inspected by customs, and the manifest is stamped with the customs inspection seal. Furthermore, the Public Concession prohibits the export of rice. However, the Japanese authorities said that they would not pay attention to the manifest and would personally inspect the cargo. It is reported that the *Anping* flies the Japanese flag.

### Rapid Rise in Prices and Rampant Speculation Cause Great Concern Among Shanghai Gentry in Hong Kong; Du Yuesheng and Others Plan to Transfer Funds Inland; National Government Currently Studying Restriction Measures

The National Government is extremely concerned about the rampant speculation and rapid rise in prices in Shanghai, which is seriously affecting people's livelihoods, and is currently studying restriction measures. In view of the fact that the activity of speculators in Shanghai is due to the abundance of idle funds that are not being used properly, it has decided to encourage investment in various productive enterprises in the interior as much as possible, providing concrete safeguards and preferential interest rates, so that both the country and the people can benefit. Shanghai gentry and financial leaders in Hong Kong, such as Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, and Wang Xiaolai, are also planning to transfer surplus funds from Shanghai to develop industries in the interior. The Shanghai financial community has always been far-sighted and will be able to fully support this national construction undertaking.

### Police Reserve Force Holds Full Drill; Rare Sight of Entire Force in Camp; Armored Vehicles Deployed Simultaneously

The *North-China Daily News* reports that the entire Western, Chinese, and Indian constables of the Shanghai Municipal Police Reserve Force, as well as the drum and bugle corps, held their

first drill in many months

at the Gordon Road police station at 11:30 am yesterday (the 19th).

The reviewers included Assistant Superintendent Van Baarn, who organized the police reserve force thirteen years ago, and Mr. Ewart, an engineer from the British-owned Shanghai General Omnibus Company, who built Shanghai's first armored car in November 1926. The reserve force was divided into four squads, with the entire force in camp at the same time,

which was a rare sight.

The reserve force has quite a few armored vehicles, but the reporter saw two newly added armored vehicles at the scene yesterday. Although the first armored car has been in use for thirteen years, the

distance it has traveled

is more than any other vehicle currently used by the police, but it is still as good as new. During the drill, a signal was given, and over two hundred reserve constables immediately gathered at the scene. The force

leader,

Chamberlain, ordered the four squads to form a line. Less than ten minutes later, the entire force returned to camp, ready to respond immediately to any disturbance in the Public Concession.

### Sincere Company Employees' Terms; Hong Kong Side Largely Accepts; Year-End Bonus Distribution to be Negotiated Separately

More than seven hundred junior and mid-level employees of the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road went on strike to demand better treatment from the management. The Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council sent personnel to mediate and advised them to resume work first. A response to the four demands made by the employees was to be given by the 20th, after consulting with the Hong Kong head office. It is now learned that the Hong Kong head office's reply telegram has arrived in Shanghai. The demands made by labor have been slightly modified. However, regarding the third demand for year-end bonus distribution, the general manager stated that he would need to consult with the Hong Kong side further to fight for it, but he would definitely not disappoint his colleagues. As for the other conditions: (1) Starting this month, a rice allowance of three dollars per person per month will be given. (2) The original three days of supplemental wages will be converted into a permanent subsidy. The other three days will be converted into a temporary special subsidy, starting from New Year's Day next year. (3) Dismissed employees must be given at least one verbal warning in advance, but violations are not subject to this rule. The company

personnel, in order to take the overall situation into account and show the genuine cooperation between labor and management during this extraordinary period, fully accepted this solution from the Hong Kong side and expressed their gratitude for the sympathy and assistance from all parties during the strike.

### Yunnan-Burma Road Begins Freight Transport

Since its completion, the Yunnan-Burma Road has been limited to passenger transport due to the limited number of vehicles. Freight transport has not yet been undertaken. It has now been learned that in order to facilitate the flow of goods in the interior, the road officially started freight transport on the 15th of last month.

### Ships from Hong Kong Still Subject to Routine Quarantine

The River Inspector's Office of the Jianghai Customs announced yesterday: "Regarding the prevalence of cholera in Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhou and the regulations for ships arriving from those ports to undergo inspection at a designated anchorage outside Wusongkou, announcements No. 3 on June 17th of this year and No. 4 on June 29th were issued. As there are no longer any cholera epidemics in those ports, the aforementioned inspections should be stopped immediately. However, ships arriving at this port from Hong Kong should still be subject to routine quarantine inspections."

### Airmail Holiday Cards to Europe and America: Today is the Last Day; Will Arrive in England and America on January 1st Next Year

The Italian postal steamer "Conte Biancamano" is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow afternoon, via Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, and Colombo, for Europe. The Shanghai Postal Administration will seal and hand over airmail letters and New Year's holiday cards destined for Europe and San Francisco, USA, to the ship to be forwarded separately in Hong Kong.

Foreign Residents in Shanghai

Although some foreign residents have stopped sending holiday cards due to the ongoing war in their home countries, many people have been flocking to the post office to send holiday cards and similar items such as calendars and New Year's gifts in recent days. If airmail holiday cards are mailed today, they can all arrive in England and America on January 2nd and 3rd of next year.

Regular New Year's cards destined for Manila, Singapore, Colombo, and other places, if mailed on the ship before 8:00 PM today, can also arrive before the New Year. According to reports, the "Conte Biancamano" can arrive in Hong Kong on the 24th, connecting with the British Royal Airmail (i.e., I.A.L.) and the American route (i.e., P.A.A.) departing from Hong Kong on the 27th of this month on the same day.

Departing from Hong Kong

The British Royal Airmail is scheduled to arrive in London on January 3rd of next year, and the American flight can fly to San Francisco on January 2nd of next year. Therefore, today is the last day for sending airmail holiday cards to the above two places. The post office may extend the

Sealing and Mailing Time

to 11:00 AM tomorrow. According to the itinerary of the "Conte Biancamano", it can arrive in Manila one day after Christmas, Singapore on the 29th, and Colombo on January 3rd of next year, then via Aden, and arrive in London, England, on January 17th.

### The Truth About the Shooting in Rongqing Lane, West Shanghai: The Deceased Was Named Peng Jiachun

The day before yesterday, at noon, in front of the Xiangfengchang Weaving Factory at No. 130 Rongqing Lane, Jessfield Road, West Shanghai, an unknown man was shot and killed. A brief account has been published in this newspaper. It is now known that the man's name was Peng Jiachun, 51 years old, and he lived at No. 20 Tangjiazhai, Hongqiao Road, Xujiahui. The cause of his death was that he was attacked by robbers who intended to steal the cat fur coat he was wearing. Because he firmly resisted and tried to escape, he was shot and killed.

### Thugs Kill Each Other

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Yongle Village (transliteration) near the Wujiaochang on Jessfield Road is the general headquarters of thugs. This morning (the 20th) at about 9:30 AM, a thug was shot and injured in a dispute with his accomplices inside the headquarters. Someone nearby called for a fire brigade ambulance, but the Japanese military police and the municipal police at the scene did not allow the injured person to be sent to the hospital.

### Qingyuli Eviction Case: Arguments Concluded, Judgment Scheduled for the 25th

The Shanghai Commercial Women's Bank and the tenants of Qingyuli on Chongqing Road are involved in an eviction case. It has been heard several times by the Second Branch of the High Court, and the argument period has arrived. At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, Judges Han Zuzhi, Shen Hong, and Zhang Qinglan opened the court again to

Continue the Arguments

The lawyers representing the tenants, Yuan Yang'an and Su Jingqi, arrived, as did Yuan Hanyun and others, the lawyers representing the Women's Bank. Zuo Deqi, a lawyer commissioned by the Poor Children's Education Institute as a participant, attended the court. The court first asked lawyer Yuan Yang'an about the points raised by the Women's Bank that the names of several tenants were inconsistent. Lawyer Yuan replied that the incorrect names were due to the Women's Bank's mistakes when filing the lawsuit in the first instance, and now the errors have been

Corrected One by One

The Women's Bank's attack on this basis is obviously inappropriate and should be based on the investigation report of the court bailiff. Then lawyer Su continued the argument, stating that (1) the newly established basis has fundamentally shaken the foundation of the original judgment, (2) the date of the extension contract should be based on the original contract obtained by the court's preservation of evidence, and the date and year submitted by the Women's Bank afterward were filled in afterward and cannot be adopted, (3) this case should be subject to

Extension Contract

The fact that the houses are old is not the reason originally requested by the Women's Bank, etc. Next, lawyer Zuo of the Poor Children's Education Institute stated the motives and reasons for signing the extension contract, saying that he still hopes that the Women's Bank will renovate as soon as possible within three years. Finally, lawyer Yuan Yang'an and the lawyers representing the Women's Bank and the Poor Children's Education Institute refuted each other, stating that since the Poor Children's Education Institute has already allowed the Women's Bank

Three Years Grace Period

to renovate, even if the renovation starts as late as January 1, 1942, the Poor Children's Education Institute has no vested interests. Its reason for participation is obviously not established. In short, these are extraordinary times. Once more than 3,000 tenants are evicted, where can they find shelter? Therefore, even if the Women's Bank wants to exercise its contractual rights, it should not do so when it is most harmful to the tenants. The court concluded the arguments and scheduled the judgment for 11:00 AM on December 25.

### Tragic Death of an Orphan: Grandmother Cries in Agony and Suffocates

Old woman Xu Gu's, 74 years old, lives in Xujiazhai, west of the Hongqiao Road stadium in West Shanghai. Her two sons and one grandson were all killed by Japanese planes during the Shanghai war. She only had a nine-year-old grandson, Fugen, left, who was lonely and helpless and raised by his grandmother Xu Gu's. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday afternoon, Fugen was hit by a Japanese truck on Hongqiao Road and fell to the ground. Later, he was seen by a fellow villager and rescued home. However, because the injury was critical, he died of his injuries yesterday morning. Xu Gu's cried in agony, fainted on the ground, and unexpectedly suffocated to death, following her grandson to the afterlife. The whole family was robbed, which is heartbreaking to hear.

### Terror World: Bloodshed in West Shanghai Repeatedly: Liu Guikuan Was Assassinated Yesterday

At about 9:30 AM yesterday morning, another assassination occurred on Jessfield Road, Baileenan Road, a road built across the border in West Shanghai. The deceased was Liu Guirong, 26 years old, who lived at No. 12 Luyang Village. He died of serious injuries on the spot. The reason for his murder is unknown.

### Pseudo-"Livestock Market" Undergoes Reorganization

Since the establishment of the "Livestock Market" organized by the pseudo-regime in this city, all livestock such as pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks transported to Shanghai from various places must be sold through the "Livestock Market" under unified control. However, due to various measures, difficulties, and pickiness, which are not in line with commercial considerations, brokers have complained incessantly. Moreover, some brokers deliberately manipulate and raise market prices. For example, the price of pork has risen to more than one yuan per catty, and the poor are crying out in pain. It is now learned that there is a sudden reorganization of the "Livestock Market," which has been renamed "Shanghai Livestock Industry Co., Ltd." The pseudo-"Municipal Government" has obtained the consent of the Japanese side, and the capital is set at 3 million yuan, with the "Municipal Government" and the contracting merchants each bearing half. It is said that the reorganization's policy is to severely punish the various malpractices of the previous organization and prevent brokers from manipulating prices to benefit the people's livelihood. However, in fact, it is still feared that it is just a change of name, a false claim.

### Social Miscellany

Embezzlement of Silk Fabrics

Lianxing Company at No. 17 Tengfeng Lane, Sichuan Road, is opened by Cantonese Xu Qingcai and specializes in selling various embroidered silk fabrics. However, its usual embroidery work is contracted to Lu Yongsheng of Pudong Embroidery Workshop at No. 33 Ye Jiazhai, Yanping Road, through the introduction of Yan Jieyi. However, Lu, with bad intentions, embezzled all the silk fabrics for embroidery worth 1,500 yuan from Xu from April 1 to July 30 this year, mortgaged them for spending, and disappeared without a trace. Xu learned of this and traced Yan Jieyi, the introducer. It was not until the day before yesterday that Lu Yongsheng was arrested on Chengdu Road and taken to the General Patrol Room. After investigation by Chinese detective Qing Muyou, he was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court Criminal Division 1. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted according to law. The defendant admitted the embezzlement without denial. Judge Feng sentenced Lu Yongsheng to eight months of imprisonment as a warning.

Pedestrian Killed in Traffic Accident

At the intersection of Maitehesit Road and Liannaot Road in West Shanghai, a No. 15096 Route 4 bus driving there at about 9:30 PM last night was speeding by. Jin Jinlong (18 years old) from Zhenjiang, a pedestrian, was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground, crushing his head and causing his brains to burst. He died on the spot. After hearing the news, street patrolman No. 2956 from the Gordon Road Police Station nearby rushed to the scene, copied the driver's license number, and urgently called a rescue vehicle to transport the body to Baolong Hospital and transfer it to the autopsy room for examination.

### Postal Administration: Recruiting New Postmen

### Notes on Theft Cases: Robbers Injure People in West Shanghai

At 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, in the alley next to Yifeng Pawnshop at No. 1148 Caojiadu, a woman of about thirty years old was walking by when three thugs suddenly blocked her way, took out box cannons, and forced the woman to take off the gold ring on her hand. The woman tried her best to refuse and was dragged into the alley. Unexpectedly, the woman was still stubborn. The robbers fired more than ten shots, one of which hit the woman's leg, causing her to fall to the ground with blood gushing out. By the time the pseudo-police arrived after hearing the alarm, the robbers had already fled without a trace.

At 8:30 AM yesterday morning, five robbers suddenly broke into No. 16, Lane 221, Weihaiwei Road, frightening the family members into silence. After rummaging through boxes and cabinets, they stole 3,000 yuan worth of jewelry.

### Shenbao Cup Charity Basketball: China Adds Strong Players; Lu Zhong'en, Zhang Shaoqing, etc. Generously Participate; Second Game Between China and the United States Tonight at 7:00 PM

In the third Shenbao Cup China-US charity game, the China and US teams are scheduled to meet for the second time at the Xiqing Gymnasium tonight. The game is still scheduled to start at 7:00 PM. In the first game the day before yesterday, the Chinese team suffered an unprecedented defeat because Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, and Shen Yugong, three members of the Hualian team, refused to cooperate, disregarding international honor and charity. Now, the selection committee, in order to remedy the situation, decided to select good players again, hoping to fight to the death with the American team and achieve the ultimate victory. It has now been decided to reject Li and the other three and submit them to public opinion. On the one hand, strong players Lu Zhong'en, Zhang Shaoqing, and Zhou Wenyong are invited to help in the battle. Fortunately, there are still two games to go, and it is not too late to catch up. The Chinese lineup has been reorganized this time and is naturally different from the day before yesterday. Although the US team is very arrogant, victory is not necessarily guaranteed, but at least there should be some hope, and it can be predicted that the game will become tense, the score will be close, and the audience will be given wonderful shots. Tickets are still limited to 300 upstairs and 154 downstairs, divided into two types: 2 yuan and 1 yuan, which are still pre-sold at Shenbao and Xiqing YMCA. Because there were too few tickets the day before yesterday, many people were unable to attend. It is hoped that you will purchase them as soon as possible to see the strength of the Chinese team after it has been reorganized. The lineups of both sides are as follows:

(Chinese Team) Lu Zhong'en, Zhang Shaoqing, Zhou Wenyong, Chen Xianglong, Xu Wenkui, Sun Huipei, Zhang Jiakui, Chen Bangzhen, Zhuo Guorong, Wang Nanqun, Li Zude, Yu Xunzi,

(American Team) Pasico, Hughes, Baudusi, Kelaisi, Tengqintuo, Robert Xu, Hensahuizi, Tinghuaer, Carson, Gaoxu,

### China-US Charity Basketball Game: The Organization Process of the Chinese Team; The Truth About the Refusal of Hualian Players to Attend; Sportsmanship and Sports Ethics Are Swept Away

The third Shenbao Cup China-US charity basketball game, the organization and selection process of the Chinese representative team this time is as follows: This year, in order to avoid disputes among the teams about the number of players selected from each team, the selection committee took an absolutely neutral stance and selected suitable players without using the team as a unit. The organizers invited individual players from each team separately. The selected candidates may not be perfect, but it is inevitable that some outstanding players will be missed. All parties unanimously expressed sympathy for international honor and charity, but Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Shen Yugong, and others raised objections, saying that too few Hualian team members were selected and that it was necessary to select Ren Xiangcheng and Bao Songyuan from the team. The selection committee believed that since a decision had been made, it would be impossible to deal with other teams if it arbitrarily added to one team at the request of one team. After discussion with Li and others, Li said that although the organizers invited each individual to participate, they were members of the Hualian Sports Association and needed to consult with Chairman Ji Kunsheng. So they discussed with Ji, but Ji's attitude was even more resolute, proposing three players from the team, Xu Zhaoxiong, Bao Songyuan, and Ren Xiangcheng, saying that they must be selected. Together with those who have already been selected, there are a total of seven people, and the captain must also be a Hualian player. Otherwise, we would rather withdraw from the game, which is close to coercion. So after repeated consultations, Ji did not make any concessions of sympathy. Finally, a friend used personal feelings to urge Li and others to take the overall situation into consideration and attend the game, but Li and others never replied, which shows their arrogant attitude. The quality of the selected players is a question, but the fact

That the Yilian wants to send the entire team of seven players to represent the team, whether it is appropriate and adequate, is a common sight. Judging from the defeat of the Hualian team in the game against the Cubs, it is even more questionable. Players are not goods, and there is no reason to raise them and lose their freedom. Promoting sports is not about monopolizing athletes in this way. It is even more absurd to want to become a player trust. At a time when sports administrative organs have successively withdrawn to the west or suspended work since the war, there should be a spirit of observing sports discipline and promoting sportsmanship. If we take advantage of this national crisis and disregard sports ethics, we should be abandoned by the Chinese sports community.

### Xiqing Basketball Game Yesterday: Yilian Lost to Military Officers: 45 to 40, Free Throws Became Key; In the Second Division Game, Guangshi Greatly Defeated the Zhendan Team

There were originally three Xiqing basketball games last night. The last game between Qianghua and Huqing was rescheduled because they had to participate in the China-US charity basketball game. The results of the second division were recorded. Guangshi won a great victory over Zhendan with 46 to 16. In the first division game between Yilian and the military officers, the battle was very tense. The military officers took the lead with 22 to 20 in the first half. After the restart, Yilian chased to 30 to 33. After that, Xiao Lu made two shots and one free throw, and the score was tied at 35 each. At this point, the situation was extremely tense, and there were less than three minutes left until the end of the game. Unfortunately, Shen Ji'en committed two consecutive fouls and was sent off the field. Lu Shunde's shot bounced out after hitting the hoop, and his bad luck could not be remedied. After that, Hang Sihui scored two free throws, and Robert Xu and Wang Erde successively hit the target. Yilian finally suffered a crushing defeat with 40 to 45.

Guangshi won Zhendan (Second Division) 46-16

### Overview of This Year's University Unified Entrance Examination (9)

Regarding the standards listed on the right, there are three points we want to specifically explain. First, the so-called examination districts and nearby districts are fixed and regulated. For example, the schools in the Chongqing district are National Central University, Chongqing University, and Jiangsu Medical College. The nearby districts are Chengdu, Guiyang, and Enshi. For the first to third choices, students from the Chongqing district will be given priority for admission to the three universities like National Central University. Any remaining slots will be filled by students from the nearby three districts according to their choices. Other districts will follow this pattern. Second, the distribution process is also detailed. For example, for the first choice, students from the same graduating school are categorized first, then those with the same academic background, then the students in each department are ranked by academic performance. Students are then admitted to each department in order of merit until the department is full. Unfilled spots remain open. Cross-checking is performed to ensure accuracy. The procedure is complex and must not be messed up. Third, the assignment of schools and departments is taken very seriously, with seven members designated by the Unified Enrollment Committee to decide the matter in a meeting. The principles used are: (1) schools are different, but departments are the same; (2) based on the three identical department choices or two department choices; (3) based on the first department choice; (4) based on location; (5) if the situation is the same, then order of merit is used. If, according to the above items, all spots are filled and no further distribution is possible, a last resort will be taken: assigning a department with a similar nature, but this must still be reasonably limited. For example, mechanical engineering can be assigned to textile engineering or the physics department, chemical engineering to the chemistry department, and political science to the law department, etc. However, there are not many students this year that have their department changed. Details can be seen in the second half of this section. (2) Analysis of Preferences: This year's unified entrance examination applicants (the enrollment list for Shanghai district students was not sent, so there are no preferences) and the recommended students have two very obvious phenomena: first, they are concentrated in a few schools; second, they are concentrated in a few departments. Details are in the table below. National Central University enrolled (hereinafter referred to as "enrolled") 17,189 for the first choice (hereinafter represented by the character "A"), 601 for the second choice (hereinafter represented by the character "B"), and 305 for the third choice (hereinafter represented by the character "C"). Recommended (hereinafter referred to as "recommended") 106 for first choice (A), 83 for second choice (B), and 74 for third choice (C). National Southwest Associated University enrolled A 1,019, B 502, C 285. Recommended A 66, B 58, C 41. Wuhan University enrolled A 293, B 340, C 233. Recommended A 24, B 40, C 35. Sun Yat-sen University enrolled A 121, B 72, C 67. Recommended B 2, C 3. Zhejiang University enrolled A 155, B 92, C 111. Recommended A 3, B 3, C 22. Northwest University enrolled A 72, B 32, C 26. Recommended B 1, C 3. Sichuan University enrolled A 43, B 39, C 52. Recommended A 2, B 6, C 9. Tongji University enrolled A 98, B 3, C 1. Xiamen University enrolled A 57, B 4, C 3. Hunan University enrolled A 37, B 38, C 42. Recommended C 2. Yunnan University enrolled A 11, B 24, C 31. Recommended A 7, B 3, C 5. Northeast University enrolled A 5, B 2, C 2. Guangxi University enrolled A 2, B 3, C 5. Recommended A 2, B 1, C 2. Jiaotong University Tangshan College of Engineering enrolled A 405, B 48, C 53. Recommended A 16, B 20, C 13. Northwest Institute of Technology enrolled A 57, B 48, C 71. Recommended A 2, B 5, C 7. Northwest Agricultural College enrolled A 20, B 6, C 7. Recommended B 1, C 1. National Teachers College enrolled A 155, B 30, C 17. Recommended B 4. Northwest Normal College enrolled A 84, B 10, C 13. Recommended A 3, B 1. Zhongzheng Medical College enrolled A 35, B 38, C 2. Recommended A 2, B 4, C 3. Guiyang Medical College enrolled A 12, B 16, C 10. Recommended C 3. Northwest Medical College enrolled A 14, B 8, C 1. Jiangsu Medical College enrolled A 10, B 13, C 6. Recommended A 2. Chongqing University enrolled A 18, B 12, C 30. Recommended C 6. Henan University enrolled A 6, B 2, C 4. Special students returning to their original school enrolled A 3. Total first choice enrollments were 4,518.

The preferences listed in the table above refer specifically to schools in the rear area. Students in the inland applying to schools in Shanghai are not included because regulations do not permit it. The discrepancy between the total number of preferences and the total number of applicants is due to this reason. Let's examine the table: those who chose National Central University and National Southwest Associated University account for more than a quarter of all enrolled or recommended students. How can distribution not be difficult? Let's also examine the department choices and their categories, which fully demonstrate the general concentration. A list of the departments and the number of first choices is as follows:

College of Arts: 245 applicants (Chinese 48, Foreign Languages 102, Philosophy 17, History 68, Sociology 10); College of Law: 758 applicants (Law 42, Politics 268, Economics 448); Teachers College: 608 applicants (Chinese 29, English 59, History and Geography 78, Public Training 50, Education 218, Mathematics 18, Physics and Chemistry 49); College of Engineering: 2,022 applicants (Civil Engineering 522, Mechanical Engineering 447, Electrical Engineering 268, Aeronautics 384, Chemical Engineering 203, Architecture 30, Water Conservancy 75, Mining and Metallurgy 91, Textile 2); College of Science: 186 applicants (Mathematics 26, Physics 31, Chemistry 62, Astronomy 1, Geography 16, Biology 17, Geology 18, Geology Geography and Meteorology 12); College of Agriculture: 215 applicants (Agronomy 72, Horticulture 26, Agricultural Chemistry 53, Forestry 14, Animal Husbandry 27, Veterinary Medicine 7, Agricultural Economics 10, Plant Diseases and Pests 3, Agricultural Water Conservancy 10). Total: 4,518 applicants. Considering the highest number of first choices for each department in each school, Central Aviation Department had 221, Mechanical Engineering Department 155, Civil Engineering Department 109, Electrical Engineering Department 108, Southwest Associated University Aviation Department 160, Mechanical Engineering Department 143, Civil Engineering Department 119, Tangshan College of Engineering Civil Engineering Department 178, Railway Management Department 179, Central Economics Department 183, Political Science Department 141, Southwest Associated University Economics Department 131, Wuhan University Economics Department 103, while the maximum capacity of each department is 20 to 70. Apart from comparing the scores of applicants with the same department choice, there is no other good method. However, as a result of the comparison, each department must eliminate at least two-thirds or more. It can be seen that the more concentrated the preferences, the better the performance of the enrolled students, and at the same time, distribution becomes very difficult.

(3) Distribution Results: After reading the above analysis of applicants' preferences, it is known that distribution is the most difficult task. The results of distribution according to distribution standards and procedures are as follows:

### High-Grade White Japonica Rice Still Not Being Sampled, Kunshan Inferior Japonica Rice Actually Sold at Limit Price, Market Has Become the World of Foreign Rice, People's Food Not Worried About Having No Rice to Cook

Yesterday, the sources from various inland regions were still under the control of certain parties. Only large quantities of foreign rice arrived in port in an endless stream, which made people more relaxed. In addition, although general merchants made additional purchases, they still did not dare to prepare too much. Therefore, most transactions were only in small quantities and lacked large deals. Stockholders and merchants, although they held a lot of thick and thin Japonica high-priced goods, still refused to provide samples. However, goods with a weaker body and mid-section were still seeking to be sold off. Moreover, large quantities of foreign rice were all being dumped. For a time, the chips on the market showed an oversupply. The purchase price of goods was difficult to maintain, and sellers all offered price reductions to attract customers. As a result, very few transactions were concluded for each type of goods. According to city statistics, it was only 3,000 to 4,000 bags. Although the market price of thick and thin Japonica rice seemed to be unchanged on the surface, it was actually lower by 30 to 50 cents due to the difference in quality compared to the previous market. At closing, Kunshan inferior Japonica and Tongli white Japonica were both 40 yuan, Li Sheng medium Japonica 39 yuan, Qing Si special thin 40 yuan, large city 39.5 yuan, Feng Jia and Nangan early and late rice 38.5 yuan. Lu Jian and Yang Jian goods were rare and uniquely flat. Lu Jian was quoted at 38.5 yuan, Yang Jian 37.5 yuan. Jiangbei Jian was opened at the limit price of 33 yuan (see the market price column for details). As for Saigon sharp rice, the market supply was the most abundant, and the price reduction was greater, at 35.7 to 35 yuan, which was a drop of 50 cents to 1 yuan compared to the previous market. Broken rice was 31 yuan, determined to be 29 yuan, and the downward trend was still similar. Tokyo sharp rice was 32 yuan, 31.5 yuan, which was not much different from the previous market, but since the price was too inferior to Saigon rice, most owners were unwilling to compare them. Moreover, light rice could maintain its original price, but only 300 to 400 bags were traded on one side. Changbang Baiyuan was 40 yuan, and Danyang Baiyuan was 39 yuan, which was also average.

Foreign rice has been imported continuously, so there is absolutely no concern about people's food. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Nanran Wheel shipped 6,077 bags of foreign rice from Saigon and 2,889 bags from Hong Kong, totaling 8,966 bags. The unloading was completed last night.

### Wheat Price Continues to Rise, Flour Is Clearly Stable but Covertly Tight

Flour: Yesterday's market was clearly stable but covertly firm. It was found that the No. 2 flour factory's price was still 8.7 yuan. In order to maintain this street, the factories still supplied as much as possible. However, the situation of returned goods became tight again, because it was rumored that the wheat price had reached a high peak of 15.15 yuan, and people seemed to feel better. Therefore, the buying sentiment for Japanese factory flour was strong again. Phoenix brand for December opened at 8.056 yuan, then rose to 0.18 yuan. January also rose from 8.467 yuan to 8.5 yuan. A total of more than 40,000 bags were traded on the market, with local and foreign merchants each taking half. Actual sales accounted for two-fourths. Today, 4,500 bags will be exported to Hong Kong.

Wheat: Yesterday's market was still firm. It was said that the price of high wheat was more than 0.15 yuan above 15 yuan, all due to the high price in the inland and the lack of sources. A total of five cars were traded on the market. Guandian and Su Kun wheat were quoted at 15 yuan to 14.75 yuan. Fuxin and Fufeng two factories jointly handled 4,500 bags of Su Xi Zhenjiang wheat, priced at 15 yuan to 14.9 yuan. Pudong wheat was 14.55 yuan. There were also 1,860 bags of beans transported to Hong Kong.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Plummets, Truth Revealed

Although this newspaper had a market price report for the sharp drop in soybean oil prices the day before yesterday (the 19th), there was no news published because, after examining the market sentiment for the past two days, the state of weakness should not be so disparate. Therefore, it was omitted. As this newspaper expected, the market was in turmoil yesterday, and a large number of people rose up to question the situation. However, there is no wave without wind. At the close of the day (the 19th), there was a batch of off-market transactions, but the price opened was quite secret. It was rumored to be 10 yuan lower than the price of the previous day. Although general powerful figures are wholeheartedly trying to control the potential trend ahead, actual sales are not rising, sources are still coming in, and there are environmental constraints, so it may be difficult to reverse this sluggish situation.

### Sugar Market: Diao Qing Must Settle Foreign Exchange

Yesterday, there was not much change in foreign sugar. The association's price for spot goods was 59.5 yuan for crude white sugar at the local warehouse, 59.7 yuan to 59.5 yuan at the foreign warehouse, and 59 yuan for those arriving in May. Transshipment goods were still 48 yuan. Tai Gu car white was slightly smaller. West Warehouse B mark was 60 yuan, East Warehouse 59.5 yuan, West Warehouse CW mark 59.5 yuan, CX mark 59 yuan, DY mark 58.5 yuan, HX mark 58 yuan, H mark car red 45 yuan, Dutch red 46.5 yuan. Local refined white and No. 1 ice sugar were unchanged. National sugar opened dozens of bags of Xinghua Qing, 42 yuan, ordinary cotton red 46 yuan, and other calling prices increased, but no transactions were made. It was also reported that starting from January 1, 29th year of Republic, all goods exported from Zhangzhou must first settle foreign exchange. If so, Diao Qing would also be no exception. Also, 470 bags of sugar were transported from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Finance: Importers Settle Spot and Forward Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed prices did not rise or fall. The dark market for British and American exchange saw a reversal today after four consecutive days of loosening. However, there were no other news. This was entirely because there were many settlements in the foreign firm sector. The process in the first half of the day: British exchange was slightly tight at the opening in the morning, while American exchange was average. Shortly after, Sassoon sold slightly, and Hong Kong also sold at the same time, but there was demand from Netherlands and Elly, so the loosening was limited. At that time, British gold was 4 765625, and American exchange was 7.84375. Soon after, major foreign firms had a strong demand, and they rushed to buy from the market. Moreover, various importers with a smaller scope also secretly purchased to settle, and banks took advantage of the situation to raise prices. In less than half an hour, British gold tightened to 4 6875, and American exchange also softened to 7.65625. After 10:30, the buying spree gradually subsided, and the market situation stabilized. Until the close, there was no significant change. The closing price of British gold was still 4 6875, and American exchange was 7.6875, resulting in a softening of 0.078125 and 0.125 compared to the previous day. The potential of futures was still similar to the spot market.

Tightening After Four Consecutive Days of Loosening

At the beginning of the morning, London large strips were 0.0625 higher for the near term and 0.125 higher for the long term. The New York silver price rose by 0.375. The London raw gold was not determined. The exchange rate for British exchange against American and French exchange was average, and against Shanghai it was higher by 0.0625. American exchange was unchanged against British exchange, higher against Shanghai by 0.05, and significantly higher against French exchange by 0.125. The central listed prices for various exchanges remained the same. At the opening of the bank this morning, the selling price of spot goods was British gold at 4 75 and American exchange at 7.8125, which was tighter by 0.015625 for British exchange and no change for American exchange compared to the previous close. After the opening, Sassoon first sold to the market, and Hong Kong Power also sold, but the number was limited, and the demand from Netherlands and Elly was good, so the loosening in the market was minimal. Sassoon sold spot British gold to Netherlands for 4 765625 and British gold for January for 4 75. Then, Hong Kong Power sold spot American exchange to Datong Netherlands Elly and a certain bank for 7.8125. At that time, HSBC's buying price once returned to 7.84375. The balance tax announced by HSBC was unchanged, and the white silver balance tax was announced to be large 0.25. After that, major foreign firms frequently settled their spot and forward payments, and foreign firms with smaller scopes also secretly bought and sold, and Hong Kong Power stopped supplying, so the situation suddenly softened. By 10:15, British gold had softened to 4 6875, and American exchange had also tightened to 7.65625. Later, there were fewer buyers, and the situation stabilized. Until noon, there was no further change. The noon closing price for spot goods at the bank was British gold at 4 6875 and American exchange at 7.6875. British gold for this month was 4 671875, American exchange was 7.65625. British gold for January was 4 65625, and American exchange was 7.5625. As a result, British exchange and American exchange all softened by 0.078125 compared to the day before yesterday. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rose Six Yuan

Hong Kong, 20th telegram: The exchange market opened stably this morning. All exchanges were unchanged compared to yesterday's close. At 10:55, the spot Shanghai exchange rose by five yuan to 317 yuan. At 11:30, the spot Shanghai exchange rose by another yuan to 318 yuan. The market was stable. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Tianjin British Rose and American Unchanged

Tianjin, 20th telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. Spot British exchange loosened by 0.0625 to 4 pence and a half. American and Shanghai exchange were unchanged, still at 7.375 and 105.5 yuan. The "United Notes" in the dark market continued to rise by 0.25 to 93.75 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Turn Firmer, American Gold Notes Rise to 13 Yuan

Yesterday, the demand for American gold and British pound recovered strongly. Customers took advantage of the low prices to snap up gold notes, and market prices rebounded sharply. The supply of Hong Kong dollars was still smooth, and the market situation was weak. French francs and Annam dollars were firm due to travel needs. Demand for Japanese notes recovered strongly, and market prices were tight. The evening market was 1.305 yuan. Fresh notes supply increased, and the market was slightly soft. The evening market was 1.1112 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British American gold and British pounds all rose by one yuan, British gold notes rose by 0.7 yuan, Americans by 0.13 yuan, Hong Kong dollars fell by 0.01 yuan, French francs rose by 0.02 yuan, Annam dollars rose by 0.02 yuan, and others were unchanged.

### Exchange Market Turns from Loose to Tight, Cash Re-enters Good Situation

Yesterday, the dark market situation for cash rose sharply as the exchange market softened, and the result was a rebound of 36 yuan. However, operators were cautious and unwilling to buy in and increase their positions when prices rose. The initial opening during the day was still weak, because foreign exchange showed a slight loose state at this time. A certain money exchange industry forcibly sold at a price, and the opening price was 4,090 yuan, which was 18 yuan lower. Then, a certain bank and others bought it on behalf of customers, pulling it up by 30 yuan. However, the silver shop gang and a certain money exchange industry resold it, and it fell back to 4,105 yuan. After that, the exchange market turned tight, which boosted the morale of buyers. Gold shops, securities gangs, and money exchange industries entered the market to bid, and the price soared to a high peak of 4,150 yuan. Then, as the foreign exchange stabilized, the multi-party thinking was not long-term, and they slowly took profits. Therefore, the noon closing price slightly fell to 4,140 yuan. The situation in the afternoon was average, with only 7 yuan of fluctuation. As a result, the closing price was 4,144 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was about 2,000 taels. The silver shop's jewelry gold was listed at a high of 5 yuan, and the customs gold was still flat.

Rose by Thirty-Six Yuan

Since the initial opening this morning, the exchange market was slightly loose and a certain money exchange industry sold at a suppressed price on behalf of customers, the opening price was lowered by 18 yuan, sold to the securities gang for 30 taels at 4,090 yuan. Shortly after, the number of buyers increased due to the low price. A certain gold shop and a certain bank competed to buy strongly, and it was pulled up by 30 yuan. The gold shop sold to the silver shop gang for 30 taels at 4,120 yuan. Then, because the silver shop gang continued to sell, and a certain money exchange industry restarted selling, the price was suppressed to 4,105 yuan. At that time, the exchange market suddenly reported a tightening, and the degree of tightening was quite fast, which boosted morale. Securities gangs, gold shops, and money exchange industries mutually released and bought, and before long, it jumped by 45 yuan. The securities gang entered the money exchange industry for 20 taels at 4,150 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange stabilized, and a certain bank's long-term thinking was not long-term, so they took profits at a high level, immediately returning 15 yuan. The gold shop sold 20 taels to the money exchange industry for 4,135 yuan. Although gold shops and others sold later, the securities gang and a certain cash gold shop had good appetites, the positions were balanced, and the price fluctuated around 4,140 yuan. Until the close, the securities gang entered the money exchange industry for 10 taels, still reporting the noon closing price of 4,140 yuan. The potential in the afternoon was calm. The first opening was raised by 5 yuan. The silver shop gang traded 10 taels of money exchange industry, 4,145 yuan. Then a certain money exchange industry also came to salvage, and the price continued to rise by 4 yuan. Money exchange industries traded 20 taels with each other, for 4,149 yuan. After entering, retail investors and gold shops released, and the price stepped down by 7 yuan. The money exchange industry released 10 taels to the silver shop gang, for 4,142 yuan. Later, the gold shop entered the money exchange industry for 20 taels, for 4,144 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it rose by 36 yuan compared to the previous day, with a total of 60 yuan of fluctuation. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand of gold was several yuan higher than the gold, and the purchase was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Listed at 5 Yuan Higher

At the beginning, the exchange price of gold jewelry per tael was still suspended at 415 yuan by Datong Bank. By 10:30, it was listed at 5 yuan higher. After that, there were no changes. As a result, Datong Bank changed the suspension to 420 yuan. The new banks were the same as the above price, and the purchase was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Where Have the New Subsidiary Coin Notes Gone?

Since the wholesale banks have distributed coin notes in order to correct past malpractices, allocating them to various banks and industries, it was thought that they would circulate extensively on the market. However, according to what we have heard and seen, the amount received by each industry is not much, and the amount received by each bank is also said to be small. What circulates on the market is still the old or newly issued streetcar and public bus fare vouchers. Subsidiary coin notes can be said to be rarely seen and hard to come by. If 1 million subsidiary coin notes were issued, taking 1 cent notes as an example, there would be 100,000,000 notes. Taking a step back, if we calculate 1 cent and 5 cent notes each as 500,000 yuan, there should also be 50,000,000 1 cent notes and 10,000,000 5 cent notes. If there were such a large number of chips on the market, it would definitely not still be using fare vouchers. So why are subsidiary coin notes still rarely seen? If they are not being stored in the treasury or private boxes of various parties, then there is much room for consideration in the issuing procedures.

Speaking of one-yuan notes and corner coin notes, what we have seen recently is nothing more than tattered and decayed banknotes. Bad money drives out good, which can be applied everywhere. However, we still see advertisements in the newspapers claiming that new one-yuan notes have arrived in the amount of tens of millions of yuan, and that there is no shortage of subsidiary coin notes. But the facts are as they are. Perhaps the goods are not flowing smoothly.

### Bank Current Account Interest Yesterday

The end of June and the end of December each year are the periods for banks to handle semi-annual account closures. The tenth of June and December are the periods for semi-annual interest calculation for current savings and current deposits. Since the outbreak of the war, many fixed deposits and savings in various banks have been converted into current accounts for expenditure. Therefore, yesterday (the 20th), various banks handled the current interest calculation for current deposits this period. The internal operations were very busy. Some banks with a large number of current account holders required their staff to work until late at night to complete the task. As for depositors, they can bring their passbooks to the bank to register the interest from today. If the passbook is not registered today, it can be registered during the next deposit or withdrawal of funds.

### Securities: Public Debt Lacks Sustained Momentum; Foreign Stocks Await After Christmas

The securities grey market showed further weakness yesterday, with a renewed lack of investor confidence, and returning to a sideways trading pattern. Trading activity therefore gradually declined. The inability to rally under these conditions is primarily due to the lack of solid fundamental support, making it difficult to expect significant prosperity or decline in the short term. At the opening yesterday, investor sentiment was still firm due to a slight gain in the Joint Venture shares. Class C shares once reached a high price of 8.15 yuan, but were then heavily sold by Sinchong, Yuen Lee, Datung, and Chiu Fung, causing Class C shares to break below the 8 yuan level, which dampened investor confidence. Therefore, the afternoon saw an even more sluggish market, with all bonds weak and unable to rise. Number 40 bonds saw considerable selling, resulting in a uniform decrease of about 0.03 yuan. The total transaction volume was 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.

Stock transactions: Open Bright Real Estate Company (formerly located at Nine Acres in the city), shares, 100 shares, priced at 3.40 yuan (par value of 10 yuan per share).

Yesterday, the stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce lacked vitality, with minimal price fluctuations. Given the current weakening of foreign exchange rates, the market appears to be temporarily entering a period of quiet, with a possible turnaround after the holidays.

### Yarn and Cotton: Foreign Cotton Declines; Local Cotton Seen as Weak; Tonghua Cotton Dropped Two or Three Yuan

The trading volume of local cotton has greatly decreased. This is because overseas Indian and American cotton markets have uniformly trended downward, leading to further declines in investor confidence. Industry participants are generally bearish, considering prices to be already high and taking a wait-and-see approach before taking action. Therefore, market prices are weak. The selling prices of both Tonghua cotton and raw cotton have decreased by 2 to 3 yuan compared to the previous day. Tonghua cotton from the Subei source is estimated at 573 bales, Changyinsha at 658 bales, and Beisha at 380 bales. The current selling prices of raw cotton are listed below:

Tongzhou 170.00 Shenxin Purchase 500 bales

Changyinsha 168.00 Shenxin Purchase 500 bales

Tongzhou 165.00 Peer Purchase 200 bales

Grass Bales 155.00 Peer Purchase 200 bales

Tonghua 168.00 Shenxin Purchase 500 bales

Tonghua 164.00 Peer Purchase 200 bales

Another report: The market price of foreign cotton. The New York cotton market opened weak yesterday morning. In addition, telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai reported declines, and all parties planned to take profits and spend a quiet Christmas and New Year. Later, Southern traders engaged in market selling, resulting in a very weak market and the lowest closing price, down 20 points from the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by more than 10 rupees, Egyptian cotton fell by 40 points, and Liverpool cotton fell by 6 to 7 pence.

The spot trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was very quiet, both for Chinese and foreign manufacturers. Traders previously purchased futures on the New York Stock Exchange and have now gained substantial profits. They also plan to follow the example of Europe and the United States by taking profits and then celebrating Christmas and the end of the year. Therefore, traders have already begun to gradually close out their futures positions from yesterday. The market price of foreign cotton yesterday, converted to factory prices based on an exchange rate of 7.6875 yuan for US dollars, is as follows:

20 count American middling 230.85

Also Also Lower grade 136.60

32 count Also 237.70

Also Also Lower grade 231.70

42 count Also 241.10

Also Also Lower grade 233.45

### Actual Demand is Too Sluggish; Cotton Yarn Faces Heavy Pressure

The yarn market is increasingly in a state of sideways trading, but with the rising trend of declines in overseas cotton markets, new buyers are increasingly hesitant and uncertain, lacking the firmness of previous sentiments. In addition, with the approach of the end of the year and the nearing of the closing period, business has experienced a temporary standstill, resulting in a more scattered market situation. Therefore, customer sales remain sluggish and weak. However, most traders are generally in a bullish position and have absorbed a sufficient amount, so they naturally do not see it as a small matter. The fundamental problem is still that actual demand is too sluggish and the pressure is relatively heavy.

The opening of the yarn market this morning saw a slight weakening of investor sentiment due to the large decline in American cotton and the intensification of the declining trend. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 711 yuan, a decrease of 9 yuan compared to the previous day. However, after the price decreased, the bulls instead remained steadfast and did not move, so the market situation became calm again for a long time. Subsequently, news of a reduction in foreign exchange rates caused a sudden increase in buying activity, and the situation became lively again. The market price gradually rebounded to 722 yuan, but after the price increased, there were many sellers again, resulting in a slight decrease after the close. According to statistics, the trading volume for the half-day was 1,185 bales. The market price for 20-count Double Horse yarn decreased by 1 yuan, Tian Nu yarn decreased by 2 yuan, and Double Earth yarn increased by 2 yuan. Today, 300 pieces of yarn are being transported to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:

Peers 1,045 Sichuan 50

Hong Kong 45 Inland 45

Total 1,185

Causing Tianjin Buyers to Scour for Dongbu Cloth; Domestic Cloth Sales Remain Strong

### Piece Goods: Rumor of Tianjin Establishing a Piece Goods Exchange Causes Tianjin Buyers to Scour for Dongbu Cloth; Domestic Cloth Sales Remain Strong

The current sales of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Nanyang groups continue to develop. In addition, with the tightening of foreign exchange rates, the demand in this street has suddenly increased. The selling prices in the morning market were slightly less than the previous day. In the afternoon, they uniformly increased. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, and coarse and fine twill increased by 0.10 to 0.15 yuan per piece. Bleached cloth and colored cloth increased by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan per piece. This street traded more than 500 pieces of white goods and bleached and dyed goods. The Yongshao group purchased nearly 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and bleached cloth. The Wanjiang group purchased more than 100 pieces of bleached cloth and striped bleached cloth fine cloth from Ewo, Lun Chang, and Shenxin factories. The Chuandian group purchased more than 5,000 pieces of blue cloth, woolen cloth, and colored twill. The Nanyang group purchased more than 6,000 pieces of bleached cloth, printed poplin, and colored satin. Ten pieces of piece goods were shipped to Tianjin on the 20th.

The opening of Dongbu white goods in the morning was flat. Later, due to the filling of orders by peers in this street, fine cloth and fine twill uniformly rebounded. The closing price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth in the morning was 21.35 yuan. Later, there were rumors that the Tianjin Piece Goods Exchange was about to be established. Tianjin buyers scoured for spot goods to use as collateral, purchasing 700 bales of fine cloth from brands such as Dragon Call, Flying Fish, and Trumpet. The market atmosphere suddenly tightened, and selling prices soared. The highest price for Dragon Head fine cloth was 21.65 yuan, and the closing price slightly decreased to 21.60 yuan. Foreign firms opened 400 bales of spot fine cloth for this month: Trumpet and Colored Ball at 20.03 yuan, Blue Phoenix at 20.02 yuan, and Flying Fish at 21 yuan. Compared to yesterday, the price of fine cloth increased by 0.50 to 0.75 yuan, and the price of fine twill increased by about 0.50 yuan per piece.

### Greatcoat Fabrics in High Demand

The inventory of greatcoat fabrics is dwindling, and with the current cold weather, demand is high. Friendship, Tianguan Tu, all-wool, and Zhao Ji's Lao Gong Mao, Xie Li, and other gray wool greatcoat fabrics are selling even more actively. Most of the major wholesale traders have sold out their stocks one after another, so market prices are rising exceptionally strongly.

### North-South Goods: Persimmon Cakes Continue to Arrive

After the new persimmon cakes were listed, the arrival of goods was not strong, so the momentum was quite firm. Another 100 cases of boxed persimmon cakes have arrived. The higher-quality ones are selling for 32 yuan to 30 yuan, with a decision at 28 yuan. Groups in this street and others all have demand, and there is little hope for relaxation in the short term. In addition, 149 boxes of cinnamon sticks were transported from Xiamen yesterday.

### Metals: Ribbed Steel Bars Soar

The market for ribbed steel bars, which had been quiet for a long time, saw strong demand from construction groups in this street yesterday. In addition, groups from Yantai, Qingdao, and Tianjin also actively purchased them. The supply of goods in the market was insufficient, so traders hoarded them and allowed small retail buyers to negotiate prices. Wholesale trading yesterday reached a massive 360 tons, setting a new record since the price increases. Therefore, investor confidence is strong. Standard market prices are 800 yuan per ton for 3/4 inch and 750 yuan for 5/8 inch to 1 inch, an increase of 10 to 20 yuan compared to the previous market. As the stock of this commodity in Shanghai is not large, the market is expected to rise further.

### Silk and Tea: Tea Market Quiet

Yesterday, European traders were hesitant to purchase green tea because the exchange rate had been frequently easing recently, and Chinese merchants were asking for even higher prices than before. Only Baochang, Yongxing, and other firms in the city purchased more than 80 cases of Zhenmei tea, with prices ranging from 82 yuan to 94 yuan, with no change from before. In addition, more than 100 packages of Xiumei and Huaxiang teas were purchased by groups from Pingjin, with prices ranging from 47 to 48 yuan, and the market was also good. In addition, 29 pieces of tea were transported to Hong Kong today.

### On Tension

— Ding Di

The opposite of leisure is tension. The meaning of tension includes both external tension (the tension of the environment) and internal tension. First, the chaos and turbulence of the external world, or the sudden arrival of an event, stimulate internal emotions, feelings, and associations, indirectly creating a sense of psychological tension. External and internal tension can be said to belong to the same realm, with the only difference being a slight variation in their external and internal aspects. We know that it is not easy to be a "calm observer" when one is tense. However, the principles of literary creation tell us that we must be an observer. In fact, tourists in the Alps rarely truly appreciate the mountain scenery, despite seeing the signs along the way. However, it is equally good to extract material from memories. Truly moving, magnificent, and great material often reappears after tension. The turbulence and chaos of the world are a reversal of the usual dull way of life.

The convergence of external events agitates the tranquil mind. All kinds of dormant emotions stir at this time, erupting into inspiration. The greater the pressure on life, the greater the reaction. Stone is chiseled into sparks, which, according to Han Yu, can also be said to be an example of the stone's inability to remain still, using fire to sound (in a broad sense). This inspiration arises from the moment of reaction under immense pressure, with myriad images being sent off with the eye and wielded by the hand. This is definitely different from the way of inspiration of "leisurely seeing the Southern Mountains" or "mournfully chanting the decline." This is the violent advance of the internal life force of human beings, reflecting the turbulent external world. As Taine said, it is a stubborn and powerful force. Not only is it hidden in the individual's subconscious, but it is also influenced by the times and race. "The force influenced by this situation is passed down through generations and is constantly subjected to subjugation and edification." Turning to ancient history, there are many such facts. The Spanish crusade against Muhammad, the expulsion of the Moors, the looting of the Jews, the establishment of the Inquisition, and the Catholic wars are all examples. Externally, they manifest as bloody resistance, devout pursuit, political organization, and military training. Reflected in literature, they are filled with complex and soul-stirring prayers and rejections, the spiritual tendencies passed down through generations, the subconscious of one's own consciousness, and a chaotic state of mind that mixes external and internal events. This is no different from a miniature shadow of a turbulent era. A literary person experiencing a turbulent year gains the experience of ten years of peaceful living. Du Fu's "poem history" poems written on the road from the bandit camp to Fengxiang, Wen Tianxiang's "Guide Record," and Gorky's "The Forties," one of which is "Prairie Fire," all fully express the turbulent life of a short period. In a tense lifestyle, their interlacing and continuity are gathered within a relatively short period of time and are extremely unpredictable.

A magnificent and splendid picture unfolds before us, and like driving on a mountain road, we are overwhelmed. Encountering such an unprecedentedly tense life, if we are not careful, our eyes will be confused by the excessively dazzling colors and jarring sounds. In this dangerous but also flat, ugly but also beautiful circle, we must immerse ourselves in the hills and valleys to share, and also lift the painting of "life" and transform it into contemplation. You strive for light and fight for torches, not regretting burning your arms, but what good is it if you only burn your arms? In addition to feeling the temporary pain, you must also hold the blazing torch high and, after experiencing the tension, be able to observe the tension from a distance, making judgments and carrying out transformations.

### Four Hundred Miles of Journey—A War Zone Memoir—

— Sheng Dan

The matter was truly unexpected. After less than half a year of mountain life, driven by a certain mission, I had to embark on a journey again. "Let me temporarily say goodbye to my newly acquainted friends!" On the eve of departure, I was indeed a little sad. Since joining the embrace of the Dabie Mountains, everything has felt fresh and pleasant. Although the material conditions cannot satisfy people, this winding and majestic world contains an active life, infinite power, and a bright future. Perhaps no one is willing to lightly abandon its caress?

On the morning of a day in late September, I finally set off. It was drizzling, and the mountains were swallowed up in clouds and mist. Only wisps of white smoke emerged from the deep ravines, indicating that the rural villages were still preparing breakfast. Thanks to Feng Xiaozhong's kindness, he hired a guide for me. So, I crossed the Shaxi River in the western suburbs and headed towards Fuziling. At this time, the route to Henan had already been cut off, so I had to take the road to Macheng in Hubei, planning to walk 40 li each day and arrive in Wuchang by the beginning of next month, and then take a car to Hunan. However, the war was happening in Songbu, so whether I could pass through the front lines was the current difficulty. "To complete the mission, how can I worry?" I encouraged myself.

In the late autumn season, the days are particularly short, as if urging pedestrians not to waste time. I had just arrived at Dingjiabu, and it was already noon. This is the leading town of Li Huang, with more than a hundred neat houses lining the wide streets, and the sounds of cars and horses were constant. It was very prosperous. However, this was the state a month ago. Now, what appeared before my eyes was a scene of broken walls and rubble. "Damn it, it was bombed like this!" the guide said, sounding surprised and angry.

"Don't be angry! They will recreate it!" I couldn't help but comfort him.

We stopped at Niushifan for lunch. The rain had not stopped, and it was already dusk. Strangely, I couldn't find any civilians in the town. Only a few monks lived in the dilapidated temple at the end of the street. Fortunately, the "Buddhist disciples" were compassionate, otherwise, we would have been helpless in terms of lighting a fire, boiling water, and cooking.

After the long night passed, we continued our journey, passing through Liji, Xiaohe, and reaching Banzhuyuan. Coincidentally, the Guangxi Youth Battlefield Service Group was also passing through here, which broke the loneliness of the journey. If I hadn't talked to the team leader, Miss Huang, I wouldn't have known she was a young girl. She had a strong physique, a resolute spirit, and moving words.

"I heard that Songbu has already started fighting...?" I asked.

She seemed to hesitate for a moment, shook her head, and said, "It shouldn't be that fast, right?" Then, she asked me why I wanted to leave the Dabie Mountains and what the purpose of going to Changsha was, as if she were interrogating a spy. Later, I learned that she was from Nanping County in Guangxi and had studied at Guida University. Since the outbreak of the war, her eldest brother had voluntarily joined the army and had been martyred in Xuzhou.

Traveling west from Banzhuyuan, passing Changling Pass, the weather had just cleared up, but the temperature suddenly dropped. The northwest wind, like scissors, swept in from all directions, testing whether people's enthusiasm had also fallen. Especially when wading through mountain streams, the cold, piercing water often made you want to stop. However, we finally overcame the natural environment and quickly arrived at Liumihe.

"Songbu was tragically bombed..." This was on the wall newspapers in the town, and passersby were discussing it with angry faces.

### Wandering on the Streets

— Lu Jiang

(1)

Wandering on the street, looking at the floating clouds in the sky, the wind blowing gently.

Brushing aside the short hair on my forehead, I lowered my head again to stare at my black shoes, which were covered in dust, and pressed my hand on the only five-yuan bill left in my pocket - my heart felt heavy.

A familiar smile was cast from over there; and so, with light and quick steps - my hand was gently and warmly held.

"Friend! How are you? Which school are you teaching at?" What a bright tone, but the heart of the person being asked began to ache.

"Me? Unemployed!" I gave her a helpless bitter smile, followed by a slight sigh.

She was stunned, staring at my disappointed face, for a long time - I could still vaguely remember her smart and blessed eyes in the past! But now...

"Do I look pitiful? What do you see?" I asked with a bitter smile.

"? " The answer was my friend's gaze, doubtful and yet sympathetic.

(2)

Who would believe that, with the help of a teacher, I had barely managed to get a job for only five months, before being replaced by someone else.

I have a bit of a stubborn personality, and I don't like to ingratiate myself with others. Maybe that offended my "superior"? Although I asked myself if I had been negligent at all in my educational duties, "trembling with fear, as if walking on thin ice." But what I got was a "dismissal without reason."

It was a humiliation. The heart of a young child was stabbed. She began to understand the difficulty of living on a solitary island by one's own strength.

I remembered the kind words of the children at parting: "Teacher! Come back after the summer vacation." Then, they handed me a few white orchids. At the moment of parting, I lived in the fragrant air of white orchids. This fully conveyed the friendship that the children had given her for half a year.

And now? The kind voices of the children often linger in my ears. The warmth of the children's friendship often and uncontrollably welled up from my painful heart!

Imagining the contempt of others (forgetting that some people would also sympathize with her), I was also embarrassed to live with my relatives, and even more afraid to go to the teacher who had helped me to tell him: "I am unemployed!"

I made up a good lie: "The school doesn't allow accommodation." - So I stayed at my relatives' house, but wandered on the streets every day. When I was hungry, I went to a restaurant, spending a few dimes. But could this kind of life continue? A five-yuan bill, how many days could it last? This long string of days? Vague.

"Go home!" But I was alone, with nothing to my name...! My home was also under the trampling of iron hooves. Young people are not used to hibernating.

What to do? Wandering back and forth on the streets like this... My heart was filled with the bitter meaning of a wanderer.

A thousand and one knots tied together? How can they be untied?? Ah!

(3)

The wind blew softly, and the crowds coming and going all wore smiles on their faces. So I looked at the sky, but this time I didn't sigh, but walked even more stubbornly, never wanting to give in.

### Night Talk

— Shen Yu-gang

"For a long time, I've wanted to be a sailor, to go to sea and seek my fortune. Ten or twenty years later, I'll bring back a tanned face to my homeland."

"So, you're a son of the sea."

"The job of lighthouse keeper once bewildered me. But, on a night as starry as tonight, I suddenly realized that that's what old people do: pointing out lost ways. People our age should be wrestling with the ocean. Did you know? Seawater comes in all sorts of colors. What I love is a black wave, crashing against the hull but spitting out white foam. Those are days of big tides. Only living on a boat can you understand the meaning of life. But, no need to cite classics, saying something about Mount Tai and a feather."

"Your words have piqued my interest."

"Are you going to convert to the sea too, to be my brother?"

"No, I mean you've piqued my interest in speaking. I prefer to be a hunter. That alertness fascinates me."

"You love something mysterious."

"Not necessarily. I'm just saying I've had that thought. Take a gun, a bag of gunpowder, and my favorite deerskin boots. Building my luck with ambition, the misfortune of animals."

"That's not fair."

"Are you a humanitarian? Haha. The best season for hunting isn't sunny days. I love the snowy winters, the mountains and fields all white. Ah, but tomorrow I'm setting off, going into the mountains to shoulder my gun."

"Are you going to hunt a deer to make boots?"

"No, I'm going into the mountains to hunt wolves."

### The Birth of Jesus and Society

The world was in darkness, and Jesus was the true light of the world. All those who lived in darkness and shadow saw the true light and were revived. The world was a dry land, and Jesus was the sweet dew of life. All who believed in him would receive the water of life and nourish their parched hearts. The world was in the midst of war and turmoil, and Jesus was the gospel of peace. When this sound entered a grieving heart, it would receive life and peace. In short, the birth of Jesus was the manifestation of God's great love, providing for all the proper needs of people's hearts. This Jesus was the "crystallization of God's love" and a noble and unparalleled gift. Looking at what Jesus gave to people from all walks of life at that time, and the admiration of people from all walks of life for Jesus, proves the correctness of the above words. (1) (To give rest to those who are weary) The shepherds in the wilderness are representatives of the working class. Under the rule of the ruling class, they were exploited of their precious sweat, blood, and time, and had no guarantee of a peaceful old age. They suffered all their lives and never had a chance to rise. Just as they were sighing in despair, they suddenly remembered the prophet's prophecy, which seemed to say, "When that day comes in the future, the afflicted will be rescued, and the laborers will surely be comforted." But when can we see it? It's still a long way off! Unexpectedly, in the night shrouded in darkness, they suddenly saw a strange light from heaven. In a state of panic, they heard the angel delivering the gospel saying, "Do not be afraid, your Savior is born tonight!" They heard Jesus' call saying, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." Because of Jesus, these gracious words have all become the way of life. (2) (To give the gospel to the poor) Please listen to Mary's song: My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed...The Mighty One has done great things for me, holy is his name. His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation...He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble. He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty. (Omitted below) To realize this ideal, Jesus must first be a poor man himself. He was not born in high-rise buildings, but in a stable and cowshed. Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but Jesus had nowhere to lay his head. He was extremely rich, but he became poor for our sake, calling believers to be spiritually rich because of his poverty. He is a poor man who makes people rich. Our poor lives and poor society are in need of the gospel, without peace, without harmony, without love, with hatred, with greed, and with selfishness, which is a great spiritual poverty, and the world is full of it. If we accept Jesus, we will surely become rich because of his love and cross. (If you want to study in detail, please send a letter to P.O. Box 1227)

### Chaplin No. 6: Script Approved, Content Secret, Jokes and Dances Extraordinarily Rich

— Hua Zhi

After completing his epic film "The Great Dictator," the comedian Chaplin originally intended to retire. Unexpectedly, he is enthusiastic. According to news from Chaplin's office at United Artists in Hollywood, the comedian is preparing to shoot another epic satire of Hitler, tentatively titled "Chaplin No. 6."

The script for this film has been approved, but the content is kept strictly secret, fearing that some people might be offended. What is known is that there are six Chaplins in the film, all playing dictators. Chaplin himself plays two roles: the dictator and a Jewish barber, who shaves the beard of another dictator. Chaplin's brother, named Sydney, plays the dictator's twin brother, along with three old partners.

In addition to the six Chaplins, Paulette Goddard, whom he once loved, plays a poor washerwoman, just like in "Modern Times." Also, Mr. Towneville plays Goering, Hitler's right-hand man, making the cast more impressive than ever. In the film, Chaplin also invents a special "Broken Boots" salute and new dances and songs.

The problem lies in the sales, because since the European war, American films have had significantly reduced outlets in countries such as England, France, and Poland. The only solution is to find other markets. Chaplin's films were previously very popular in Russia, but since the Soviet Union has recently shaken hands with Germany, whether the comedian's satire of the German leader will be banned is also a question.

Regarding this point, Chaplin once stood up to defend himself, saying that the international situation is ever-changing. By the time my film is completed, the Soviet Union will no longer be aligned with Germany. My work will definitely not encounter any obstacles, it can be predicted.

### MGM to Film "Chinese Water Margin"

— Ye

China has become the best place for Hollywood filmmakers to gather script material. In recent years, there have been several films with China as the theme or background. Warner Oland's "Shanghai Madness," which was shown in China last year, created unprecedented box office records when it opened in New York. This naturally attracted great attention from MGM. Therefore, "The Good Earth," which they had spent more than two years producing at home and abroad, was quickly completed. Although the box office was not as successful as "Shanghai Madness," it still made a profit of over a million US dollars. Now, the owner of MGM has officially announced that after "The Good Earth," they will decide to adapt Pearl S. Buck's translation of "All Men Are Brothers" (Chinese Water Margin) for the screen, with a production budget of four million US dollars. As for location shooting, given the special circumstances in China, it has been decided not to film in China again.

As for the 108 heroes needed for "Chinese Water Margin," MGM believes that it is impossible to find so many male stars to play the roles, and that having too many people would diminish the interest in the plot. Therefore, it has been decided that there will be no more than thirty-five characters. Currently, because the original translator, Pearl S. Buck, is still recovering in London and has refused to help with the production, MGM is preparing to hire a famous Chinese professor in New York to serve as a special advisor for "Chinese Water Margin." They are currently looking for someone. At the same time, MGM is also preparing to ask the Chinese government to send personnel to Hollywood as consultants and observers.

The director of the film has been selected as Fred Zinnemann, and the main actors have been tentatively set as Paul Muni, Wallace Beery, William Wellman, Stuart Erwin, Luise Rainer, Una Merkel, and C. Aubrey Smith, among others. Chinese actors include the American-trained dramatist Zhu Jun and Miss Yang Zhu, who appeared in "The Good Earth."

We hope that MGM's production of this film about the great spirit of Chinese national heroes, with millions of US dollars, will at least not violate the wishes of the Chinese people. Distortions such as Chinese people with bound feet and queues must absolutely not be found in "Chinese Water Margin."

### "China Travel Troupe" Revives, First Play is "Resurrection"

After "China Travel Troupe" signed a contract with the Xuan Palace recently, Tang Huaiqiu wrote to Hong Kong to recruit old members to return, such as Ge Xin and Li Jingbo, who have now arrived in Shanghai. At the same time, he asked friends to invite Shanghai drama and film actors to join as guest performers, such as Liu Qiong, Yan Fei, Tu Guangqi, and Ding Zhi and their wives, all of whom have agreed to join the special lineup of "China Travel Troupe."

The first play to meet the audience is "Resurrection," but this is a charity performance at the request of the Shanghai Refugee Association, starting on the 24th and running for five days. As for the official premiere, it is scheduled for New Year's Eve this year, with the play "Empress Dowager" by Wei Ruhui.

### Veteran Actress Mary Pickford Recovers from Fall

— Hui Cun

American veteran actress Mary Pickford, the ex-wife of the late Douglas Fairbanks, has been traveling in England with her new husband, Charles Rogers, for two months. Recently, they were traveling in Scotland and were injured in a car accident in a certain place. Fortunately, the injuries were not serious, and after two weeks of recuperation in the hospital, she has fully recovered. Note: Charles Rogers was a handsome young actor from the early sound film era, who co-starred with Mary Pickford in the film "Kiki." The two fell in love at first sight and declared their love and cohabitation.

### Rambling about "The Gay Divorcee"

— Jue

Claudette Colbert's acting skills in "It Happened One Night" showed extreme brilliance. Following that, her performance in "The Eighth Wife" was particularly excellent, fully demonstrating her comedic talent and promising unlimited prospects. MGM director giant Van Dyke II, how could he let go of this type of talent, specially hired her to star in "The Gay Divorcee," creating a new style in the 1934 comedy films.

The entire film is linked by clever jokes, from the encounter with beauty in the suburbs to the final revelation, every moment of progress, every performance, is full of humorous language and funny actions. In particular, the woman's relentless pursuit, following east and west, and the man's desperate escape, unwilling to be a pink prisoner. Colbert vividly portrays a passionate female poet, every move making people smile and unable to help but laugh. Stewart's private detective shows a foolish appearance, which is particularly ingenious, without a moment of calm, without a moment of slowness, the entire film progresses in high-speed jokes.

The most ridiculous thing is when Stewart has pursuers in front and no way out, he puts on a pair of deep nearsighted glasses, pretending to be a Boy Scout coach, staggering and stumbling, like a blind man riding a blind horse, bumping around everywhere. Thanks to Colbert's support, he escaped the encirclement. This kind of performance is truly the height of slapstick comedy, and everyone will laugh until their stomachs hurt.
