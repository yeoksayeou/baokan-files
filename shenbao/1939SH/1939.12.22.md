### Fierce Battle Unfolds on Yongbin Road; Chinese Troops Reclaim Kunlun Pass; Heavy Casualties for Japanese Troops; Main Force Decimated; Entire Front Wavering; Chinese Air Force Bombs Japanese Positions Near Nanning; Nanning Now Under Four-Sided Encirclement

Guilin - According to a phone call from a certain front-line commander, the Chinese troops recaptured Kunlun Pass late on the 20th, with morale extremely high. The main force is currently pursuing the defeated Japanese troops. (21st dispatch)

Guilin - Since the Japanese occupation of Nanning in South China, the roads behind them have been gradually destroyed by the Chinese, creating a "kangaroo" situation. To secure a retreat route, the Japanese must maintain control of Nanning. To hold Nanning, they must occupy Kunlun Pass. Therefore, the main force of the Japanese army has been placed on the Yongbin Road, attempting to defend Kunlun Pass at all costs. Chinese troops ambushed from both sides of the road towards Qitang, Liutang, and other locations. Knowing that retreating to Nanning was not as good as a fierce assault on Kunlun Pass, a fierce guerrilla war on the Yongbin Road and a battle for Kunlun Pass unfolded. Kunlun Pass was once recaptured by the Chinese troops but was retaken by the Japanese on the 19th through a desperate attack. Chinese troops, realizing that the supply lines of the Japanese troops at Qitang, Batang, and Jiutang were about to be cut, intercepted and killed them, putting the Japanese in a dilemma. Therefore, on the 20th, they launched a brave and fierce attack, recapturing Kunlun Pass that evening. The intensity of this decisive battle was rare in recent times. The Japanese relied on their superior firepower to suppress the Chinese, with planes flying in circles in swarms, fiercely bombing the Chinese positions. The Chinese troops paid no heed and finally drove back the stubbornly resisting Japanese troops. The heavy casualties suffered by the Japanese are enough to chill their hearts, while the Chinese casualties were also significant. This time, the Chinese troops' recapture of Kunlun Pass not only caused the entire Japanese front to waver, but the time for the complete annihilation of the Japanese is not far off. Kunlun Pass is the most dangerous place on the Yongbin Road, stretching for ten Chinese miles. The pass is particularly steep, like the throat of Nanning. Apart from Kunlun Pass, Jiutang, Batang, and Qitang on the Yongbin Road have some strategic value, but Liutang gradually becomes flat. The mountainous terrain near Ertang is slightly undulating but not considered dangerous. (21st dispatch)

Chongqing - According to news this morning, the Chinese air force participated in the counter-offensive against Nanning yesterday. Chinese planes bombed Japanese positions near Nanning, causing significant losses to the Japanese. Yesterday afternoon, Japanese planes bombed various locations in Guangxi, attempting to stop the Chinese counter-offensive. (21st Associated Press dispatch)

Liuzhou - The Chinese troops have been attacking the Qin-Dong area for days, capturing many prisoners. They stormed Xiaodong twice, inflicting particularly heavy damage on the Japanese. The Japanese immediately dispatched the Kishi Regiment and the Sasebo Naval Landing Force, advancing in three routes from Yuping, Qinggang, and Naxiang towards Shangjing. After the Chinese bravely resisted and launched a fierce flanking attack near Nalong, fierce fighting ensued for two days and nights. The Japanese abandoned hundreds of corpses and fled in disarray towards Qin-Dong. The Chinese took advantage of the victory to recapture strongholds such as Taiping, Shangjing, Xinping, and Dabao. Another unit of the Chinese troops recaptured Niugang on the 19th, killing many Japanese. The Japanese troops fled towards Qingtang from Qinzhou, and the Chinese are currently in pursuit. (21st dispatch)

Chongqing - The Chinese military spokesperson stated today while receiving newspaper reporters that the recovery of Nanning is imminent. The vanguard of the Chinese troops has reached the suburbs of the city. One column of Chinese troops advancing from Wuming has advanced to a location only ten miles from Nanning. Another column advancing from Binyang has advanced to a location fifteen miles northeast of the city. The spokesperson detailed the Chinese army's determination to recover Nanning, as the city controls the highway traffic to French Indochina, which observers see as China's lifeline. It was also stated that last week, the left wing of the Chinese army advanced west in two groups, cutting off the highway at two points south of Nanning to prevent the Japanese from transporting reinforcements and supplies from the coast via Qinzhou to Nanning. At the same time, the Chinese troops from Wuming and Binyang began their offensive, encircling the city. The main force of the Japanese army is currently concentrated on the highway northeast of Nanning. On Sunday night, the Chinese troops on the Binyang Road captured Kunlun Pass, the gateway to Nanning. Another group of Chinese troops fought behind the main force of the Japanese army, recovering Wutang, fifteen miles northeast of Nanning, cutting off the retreat route of the Japanese troops at Kunlun Pass. This afternoon, it was announced here that the Chinese troops had recovered Batang, a key point northeast of Nanning. According to Chinese sources, now that Batang is in the hands of the Chinese army, the encirclement of Nanning is complete. According to the latest Chinese military reports, the Japanese troops in Qinzhou are attempting to restore traffic with Nanning, launching a fierce attack on Lingshan to threaten the rear of the Chinese troops defending the highway south of Nanning, but they have been repelled by the Chinese troops. (21st Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing - According to the Chinese military spokesperson to foreign reporters today, the Japanese troops in Nanning are under four-sided encirclement. The recovery of Nanning is imminent.

Editorial

### Japan's Recent Actions

To be fair, the Japanese have their own strengths, and it is not appropriate to belittle them lightly as being completely worthless. However, Japan's attempt to annex and unify a fully unified China is a case of being blinded by greed, resulting in every action being wrong and utterly futile. The recent actions they have taken in the military, diplomatic, and political spheres are all of a lower intelligence, which is not due to ignorance but solely to being blinded by their own greed.

Before pointing out recent events, let's briefly review the past: Japan took advantage of China's natural and man-made disasters during the September 18th Incident. If they had assessed their capabilities and maintained a state of security and prosperity, dedicating all their efforts to diligently managing the Northeast, then by today, not only would they have established a more solid foundation in the Northeast, but they would also have been able to command respect and dominance on the international stage. Even if this had not been the case, the European war would have created yet another golden era for them economically. This can be stated with certainty. However, they became greedy and coveted Tianjin and Beijing, indulging in grandiose ambitions and failing to exercise self-control. The Xi'an Incident in China proved that the Chinese nation was moving towards reconciliation through sincerity and dedication. At this point, Japan should have awakened and changed course, but it did not. The Lugouqiao Incident proved that the Chinese government, military, and civilians were completely united for the final stand. At this point, Japan should have pulled back from the brink and changed its plans, but it did not. Ignoring the fact that a fully unified China could not be insulted, they still pursued a quick and decisive victory, repeatedly making mistakes and leading themselves to their current predicament.

What is the situation today? Militarily, they are exhausted from defending the points and lines they have occupied. The large-scale offensive they launched in northern Hunan ended in failure. These are all undeniable facts, so we will not discuss them in detail. Let's ask, what is the meaning or value of dividing their forces to attack Guangxi? Diplomatically, they have exhausted all their tricks and resorted to all sorts of ugly tactics towards Germany, the Soviet Union, and Britain and France, achieving nothing. While they can attribute the reason for this to the hesitation and vacillation of Germany, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, leading to the failure of Japan's tactics, we will set aside that minor argument. Let's ask, what is the use or hope of currying favor with the United States by proclaiming the opening of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River as a strategy? Politically, we will not discuss what they have done in Peiping and Nanjing. We will not discuss the so-called "cooperative body" or the "new order." Peace is naturally the end of war, but Tokyo is collectively preaching "Mahayana" Dharma, still unable to shed its narrow-mindedness. It is evident that they cannot forget their desire for control, but they are unable to achieve it. This thing, this ambition, is completely contradictory. What path or future do they have? Are we intentionally disparaging them? In reality, they are utterly futile!

The Japanese have the strength of being diligent and persistent, and with this, they are able to delve deeply and succeed in academic research and business ventures. However, using this same spirit to attempt to annex a China that cannot be annexed is a grave mistake. Recently, their all-out efforts in the military, attacking Guangxi; in diplomacy, currying favor with the United States; and in politics, calling for peace, are all due to their thinking being numbed by a single thought of greed. They are scratching an itch from afar without realizing it. In military terms, either removing the firewood from under the pot or achieving victory through surprise may have had some hope of success in the early stages of the war. However, after two and a half years of prolonged warfare, there is absolutely no possibility of achieving any luck. Unable to achieve success in any of their advances, Japan suddenly attacked Guangxi. Those who know the situation assert that there is absolutely no strategic reason for this, while those who do not understand may feel that it is unfathomable. When their generals sent telegrams to the military and civilian leaders of Guangxi, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Huang Xuchu, enticing them with compromise, the Japanese's delusional wishes were exposed. It was then realized that the heavily hyped landing in Beihai was a military attempt with no chance of success. Such attempts are known by those of average intelligence to be ineffective and will not be made, but the Japanese do it. In diplomacy, there are various methods for influencing other countries, such as imposing treaty obligations, enticing with interests, or appealing to justice and emotion. In the case of the United States and the Far East issue, treaty obligations, interests, and justice and emotion are all fully aligned. Therefore, the only way for Japan to influence the United States is to respect the relevant treaties of the United States, respect American interests, strive for justice, and cultivate friendship. What other actions would be effective or hopeful? After a long period of erosion and repeated breaches of trust, Japan merely proclaims the so-called willingness to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, hoping to win back the heart of the United States. Those with common sense can know that this is ineffective, but the Japanese are indulging in this delusional wish. In politics, China has its absolute standards, which are the completeness of sovereignty, territory, and administration. If Japan can respect these standards, then all Chinese people will be willing to cease hostilities and seek peace. If they cannot meet these standards, even if someone signs any treaty with Japan, the war will still not end, peace will still not be achieved, and Japan will still not be able to extricate itself from the quagmire. The key to this is simple and clear. However, Japan is unable to sincerely respect the absolute standards held by China, yet it wants to extricate itself from the quagmire and dominate a peaceful utopia. In short, the Japanese are not stupid, but they have not yet been able to recover their normal rationality. Compared to the madness of a year ago, they are gradually recovering their obscured consciousness. Therefore, they know that fierce fighting is ineffective and that compromise is the only way; that unilateralism is unacceptable in diplomacy and that the understanding of other countries must be obtained; and that peace must be sought from China in politics. Being obscured, they are like a blind man riding a blind horse. It remains to be seen how long it will take for them to transition from being obscured to being clear and perceptive.

### Ambassador Hu Meets with US President, Reports on the Current State of the War of Resistance, States That Offensives Have Been Launched on All Fronts; President Roosevelt Is Quite Enthusiastic

Washington - The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hu Shih, paid a visit to President Roosevelt today, informing him that Chinese troops have launched offensives on all fronts. He told reporters afterwards that "Our situation is not as difficult as some people imagine. This is what I told President Roosevelt. In terms of transportation, although some transportation lines in Guangxi Province have been cut off after the invasion, they are not of major importance. We are now building new roads to replace them. Our troops are launching offensives on all fronts, and more good news will be reported soon." (20th Havas dispatch)

Washington - The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Hu Shih, met with President Roosevelt yesterday, reporting on the optimistic situation of China's resistance against the Japanese invasion. Last week, the President invited Hu Shih to the White House for a meeting during a diplomatic banquet. Hu Shih stated, "I told the President that the situation in China is not as dire as some people imagine, and the President was very enthusiastic about this. I also told the President that the Japanese invasion of southern China and the cutting off of Chinese transportation routes did not have a significant impact on China's war of resistance. We are currently building new highways to obtain new supplies." Hu Shih continued that the Chinese army is attacking the Japanese army on all fronts and expressed, "We will soon hear more news of victories." Hu Shih spoke highly of President Roosevelt, calling him "one of the most knowledgeable people in the world regarding international affairs." (21st Associated Press dispatch)

### United States Tightens Blockade of Aviation Resources to Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union, Prevents Leakage of Gasoline Refining Technology

Washington - The State Department recently issued a press release stating, "For the sake of national interests, this Department has exchanged opinions with the Departments of the Army and Navy and has decided to advise domestic manufacturers not to supply certain countries with drawings, tools, and other technical knowledge related to the refining of high-grade gasoline." Diplomatic sources here recently stated that this measure applies to Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union. The State Department will notify the major gasoline plants in the country accordingly. The government had previously advised domestic merchants not to ship kerosene to these countries, but these countries had already stored large quantities of kerosene. If they also acquire the knowledge and ability to refine high-grade gasoline, even if American merchants comply with the government's advice and no longer supply kerosene to these countries, it would be difficult to achieve practical results. This shows the State Department's intention in adopting the above decision, which is to prevent problems before they arise and to ensure that the measure of preventing kerosene from being shipped to certain countries is foolproof. (20th Havas dispatch)

Washington - The State Department yesterday expanded the "moral embargo" on the export of aircraft to various areas that bombard civilians, including not selling aircraft manufacturing rights and selling technical information on high-quality aircraft fuel.

### United States Extends Credit to China; Account of Receipts and Disbursements Released

### British Times Discusses Opening the Yangtze River

London - Well-informed sources here have expressed their welcome for Japan's agreement to open the Yangtze River to navigation for all countries, considering it a clear sign of a more constructive policy by the Tokyo government. The Times' diplomatic correspondent stated that the purpose of this move by the Japanese is clearly to improve relations between Japan and the United States, hoping that the US State Department will renew its commercial treaty with Japan. A second purpose may be to improve relations between Britain and Japan. In short, the Japanese government's initiation of a policy that is not approved by its military "advancement elements" demonstrates considerable courage. Today, The Times also published an editorial stating that the news that Japan is reopening the Yangtze River to navigation for all countries as far as Nanjing is naturally welcomed by the general public. This is the first direct step towards restoring Shanghai as a trading center for the distribution of goods. However, the actual effect of this move may not be very great in practice. In recent years, many goods from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have been transported to Shanghai via detours. In addition, the goods transported down the Yangtze River by Japanese merchant ships have gradually restored the vitality of the Shanghai port. However, Nanjing is located more than a hundred miles from the mouth of the Yangtze River, and the section below that is only a small part of the Yangtze River entering the interior of China. If Yangtze River shipping to Shanghai is to have any significant impact, it is necessary to open the river as far as Hankou. However, this recent development is a promising sign. The exchange rate of Chinese legal tender has shown a more stable trend, which can be considered a reflection. (21st Reuters dispatch)

### British Relief Fund for China Remits Donations to China

I sincerely hope to do my best to enhance the friendly relations between the two countries." (21st dispatch)

Buenos Aires: After the captain of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee," Captain Hans Langsdorff, committed suicide this morning, the Argentine Navy Department decided to send a marine corps to participate in the funeral procession. All the sailors of the "Admiral Graf Spee" only heard the tragic news at 3:40 PM today. They said that Captain Langsdorff had recently given personal belongings to various officers and sailors, indicating that he had intended to commit suicide for some time. (20th Havas Dispatch)

Buenos Aires: The captain of the German pocket battleship Graf Spee, Langsdorff, committed suicide with a pistol the night before last, leaving a suicide note stating that when he realized that the ship could not be saved, he had resolved to perish with the ship, but in order to ensure the safety of more than a thousand of his comrades, he had to prolong his life. Langsdorff was born on March 20, 1894, in Bergen on the island of Rügen in the Baltic Sea. He joined the Navy in 1912 and was promoted to captain of the Admiral Graf Spee in October 1938. Langsdorff's body is currently lying in state at the German Embassy in Argentina, and the funeral will be held today at the German cemetery here. All the crew members of the Graf Spee will participate in the funeral procession. The Argentine Navy has appointed several senior naval officers as representatives to pay their respects. The German Embassy in Argentina also issued a statement yesterday stating that Langsdorff had long decided to perish with the ship, and his will was firm, but given his position as captain and his responsibility to protect the lives of more than a thousand crew members, he postponed his martyrdom. His superiors knew of his will, and Langsdorff waited until his duties were completed before committing suicide to achieve his benevolence, which can be called heroic. Langsdorff's bravery and decisiveness have added another hero to the glorious history of the German Navy, and he is the glory of the nation. (21st Reuters Dispatch)

London: After the captain of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee," Captain Hans Langsdorff, committed suicide, the newspapers here expressed their respect for him, believing that this was a way to preserve the reputation of the German Navy and oppose Hitler's order to sink the ship. The Daily Telegraph reported that this act proves that Captain Langsdorff feared nothing more than losing his own honor. He was a true naval hero, who could not tolerate the humiliation inflicted upon him by Hitler and therefore committed suicide to cleanse it. His plight is extremely tragic, and all those who fought against him should pay their respects. The Times reported that "Captain Langsdorff felt extremely distressed and therefore resorted to suicide. Naval comrades from all countries, even in wartime, should sympathize with him. The famous German naval commander Graf Spee and many officers who have contributed to the development of the great traditional spirit of the German Navy will understand Langsdorff's predicament. These officers, although despised by the German authorities, have no other opportunity to serve their country other than being at their disposal, which is a pity." The News Chronicle reported that "After the German authorities ordered the sinking of the "Admiral Graf Spee," the German Navy was once again despised by the world. Langsdorff's suicide not only represented a protest on his own behalf, but also on behalf of the entire German Navy." (21st Havas Dispatch)

### Crew Members of the Columbus to Temporarily Remain in US Territory; Treated as Ordinary Merchant Seamen; Residence Limited to Sixty Days

New York: The 589 crew members of the German liner "Columbus" (vulgar name), after their ordeal, were brought to the port by the American cruiser "Tuscaloosa" at 4:30 PM yesterday and landed on Ellis Island. The US Immigration Inspection Bureau (located on the island) treated them as ordinary merchant seamen and allowed them to reside in the United States for sixty days, after which they must leave the country on non-American ships. This liner sailed from Veracruz, Mexico, on the 13th of this month, carrying 591 crew members, including one woman. When it was scuttled, one man and one woman were injured and rescued by the British destroyer "Hyperion." The remaining 589 people were rescued by the American ship "Tuscaloosa." According to a crew member, no one except the captain knew where they were headed when they left Veracruz. However, they all believed that the voyage was intended to break through the blockade of British and French warships and escape back to their home country, as another German liner, the "Bremen," had done. They thought that the British warships were gathered outside Montevideo, Uruguay, waiting for the "Admiral Graf Spee" to sail out, and they might be able to escape, but they did not know that they would meet the British destroyer "Hyperion" before noon on the 19th of this month. At that time, they intended to enter American territorial waters, but the British ship was much faster than the "Columbus" and was quickly overtaken. The captain then ordered the crew to spread kerosene over the deck and in various compartments. All the crew members boarded lifeboats, leaving only nine people to be responsible for setting the fire. When the task was completed, they jumped into the sea. (21st Havas Dispatch)

New York: President Secretary O'Leary stated tonight that the US government has now received a more detailed report and believes that the German liner Columbus was scuttled to avoid encountering the Allied Navy outside the neutral zone or being captured by them. Since there was no naval battle, the issue of violating the neutral zone does not arise. The American ship Tuscaloosa, which rescued the crew members of the Columbus, arrived at Staten Island tonight and immediately transferred the rescued crew members to a riverboat to Ellis Island to be inspected by the US immigration authorities. The Columbus, weighing 32,565 tons, was the third largest merchant ship in Germany and was scuttled yesterday outside Cape Henry, Virginia. (21st Reuters Dispatch)

### Soviet Union Celebrates Stalin's Sixtieth Birthday; Pravda Publishes Stalin's Brief History: Father Was a Shoemaker, Mother Was a Serf's Daughter; Presiding Over the Soviet Political Situation for Seventeen Years

Moscow: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued an order today stating: "Comrade Stalin organized the Bolshevik Party, created the Soviet state, built a socialist society within the Soviet Union, and consolidated the friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, achieving world-shaking feats. On the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, he should be awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor and the Order of Lenin, the highest Soviet honor, as a reward." The Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, in commemoration of Stalin's sixtieth birthday, has decided to establish the following prizes: (1) Sixteen Stalin Prizes for Science and Literature, each with an annual prize of 100,000 rubles, awarded to scientists and artists with outstanding achievements in physics, mathematics, engineering, chemistry, biology, agronomy, medicine, philosophy, economics, history, linguistics, law, music, painting, sculpture, architecture, and stage and film arts.

(3) Stalin Military Science Prizes, with three first prizes each year, each worth 100,000 rubles, five second prizes, each worth 50,000 rubles, and ten third prizes, each worth 25,000 rubles. (4) Four thousand Stalin Prizes for Higher Education Students, each worth 500 to 1,000 rubles. (5) One hundred and fifty Stalin Scholarships for Scientific Preparatory Personnel, each worth 1,000 to 1,500 rubles. Pravda also published Stalin's brief history as follows:

Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (original surname Dzhugashvili) was born on December 21, 1879, in the town of Gori, Tiflis Province. His father, Vissarion Dzhugashvili, was a Georgian, originally a farmer in the village of Didivelo in the same province, later moved to the town of Gori and became a shoemaker. His mother, Ekaterina, was the daughter of a serf.

Stalin entered the Gori Church School in 1888 and graduated in 1894, entering the Tiflis Theological Seminary. At the age of fifteen, he became involved with secret Russian revolutionary groups. In 1897, he became the leader of a secret Marxist group within the seminary. In August 1898, he formally joined the Tiflis branch of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party.

When Lenin's "Iskra" newspaper began publication in 1900, Stalin fully accepted its position. In 1900 and 1901, strikes occurred frequently in Tiflis. In 1901, the illegal May Day demonstration held in the center of Tiflis was organized and led by Stalin. At that time, the Tsarist Russian government was deeply alarmed by the development of the revolutionary movement and intensified its suppression. On March 22, 1901, the police searched Stalin's residence. Stalin was then forced to go underground until the February Revolution of 1917.

The Tsarist Russian government, realizing that Stalin was an outstanding revolutionary, did its best to obstruct him. Between 1902 and 1913, Stalin was arrested eight times, exiled seven times, and escaped from exile six times. In September 1901, Stalin was elected as a member of the Tiflis branch committee of the Social Democratic Labor Party (abbreviated as SDLP). In November, he went to Batum to form a local SDLP branch, led strikes, and organized a large-scale political demonstration in March of the following year, personally leading the march. In early April 1902, he was arrested for the first time, but he maintained contact with the revolutionary movement in prison, thus learning about the serious differences between the Bolshevik and Menshevik factions, and Stalin resolutely supported Lenin and the Bolsheviks' position. At the end of November 1903, Stalin was sentenced to exile in the village of Novaya Uda, Irkutsk Province, in eastern Siberia. On January 5, 1904, he escaped from the village and returned to the Caucasus to engage in revolutionary work. In December 1905, he served as the representative of the Bolsheviks in the Transcaucasian region and attended the first All-Russian Bolshevik Conference held in Tampere, Finland, where he first met Lenin. Stalin was also very active at the Fourth Congress of the SDLP held in Stockholm in 1906, and together with Lenin, he strived for the Bolshevik line in the development of the revolution. In 1907, he attended the Fifth Congress held in London.

In 1907, Stalin began to engage in revolutionary activities in Baku, the largest industrial city in Transcaucasia and one of the important centers of the Russian workers' movement. Stalin worked hard in the city for a year, making the workers support Bolshevism. On March 25, 1908, Stalin was arrested for the second time. After being imprisoned for eight months, he was sentenced to exile in Solvychegodsk, Vologda Province, for two years. But on June 24, 1909, he escaped for the second time and returned to Baku to engage in illegal activities. On March 23, 1910, he was arrested for the third time in Baku and, after being imprisoned for six months, was sent back to Solvychegodsk. In the late summer and early autumn of 1911, he escaped for the third time and went to St. Petersburg. On September 9 of the same year, he was arrested for the fourth time in the city and exiled to Vologda Province for the third time. In January of the following year, a major event occurred in the SDLP, the Prague Conference of the Party expelled the Mensheviks and organized the Bolsheviks. Stalin was elected as a member of the Party Central Committee in absentia and, on Lenin's recommendation, was appointed as the director of the Russian Bureau of the Central Committee. At that time, Stalin was in exile and had to find a way to escape, so Ordzhonikidze, on Lenin's orders, went to Vologda to see Stalin and give him instructions. Stalin then escaped for the fourth time on February 29, 1912.

In that year, on Stalin's initiative, the first mass newspaper of the Bolshevik Party, "Pravda," began publication in St. Petersburg. Its first issue was personally directed and edited by Stalin, and its content clearly declared its political orientation.

On April 22, 1922, Stalin was arrested again on a street in Petrograd. After being imprisoned for several months, he was sentenced to exile in the Narym region for three years. But on September 1 of that year, Stalin escaped back to Petrograd, where he edited the "Zvezda" and "Pravda" newspapers, and directed the Bolsheviks' activities during the Fourth Congress elections. Stalin took great risks to attend emergency meetings in various factories and deliver speeches. During this period, his relationship with Lenin became even closer. Lenin personally wrote to express his complete approval of Stalin's activities, speeches, and writings. Stalin visited Lenin in Gorki twice and attended meetings, and while living abroad, he wrote his historical masterpiece "Marxism and the National Question." (To be continued)

### US Secretary of War Expresses Thoughts on the European War: The Security of the Americas Depends on the Efforts of the People

Washington: US Secretary of War Woodring delivered a radio address tonight on the security of the Americas, stating that the current expansion of the European war is a major hidden danger to the peace and security of the Americas. War is like a wildfire; a single spark can lead to a conflagration. Security does not depend solely on the size of a nation's military, its economic wealth, its location, or its moral strength, but all of these are necessary. My primary responsibility is to ensure that the US Army is prepared to deal with any threat of aggression. However, I am also extremely concerned about the nation's economic structure and the moral qualities of its people. Why have countries failed to resolve disputes through roundtable talks? Even wars with righteous causes cannot end war, only weaken and consume civilization. Ordinary diplomatic contacts in Europe are decreasing, while the need for a common gathering place for all countries is increasing. In recent months, a powerful public opinion group has emerged around the world, supporting the idea that only on a foundation of honesty can the future of civilization be guaranteed. What they consider glorious is not only fulfilling current promises but also acknowledging and correcting past mistakes. The peace and security of the Americas depend on the ability of the people to make the Americas strong militarily, economically, morally, and spiritually. Only the struggle to rebuild moral armament can give people hope for a war that can truly end all wars. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)

### Chairman of the Taiwan Chinese Association, Chen Fa-li, Dies a Martyr in Taiwan; Detained by the Taiwan Governor-General's Office for Two Years; Poisoned to Death for Refusing to Submit to Japan

Fuzhou Communication: Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, there were more than 80,000 overseas Chinese in Taiwan, four-fifths of whom were from Fujian, mostly engaged in tailoring, hairdressing, goldsmithing, and restaurant businesses. After the August 13th Shanghai Battle, more than 50,000 people returned to China. However, there were still about 20,000 people who could not return to China due to environmental pressures (such as having industries in Taiwan or marrying Taiwanese wives). Chen Fa-li, chairman of the Taiwan Chinese General Association, was arrested and imprisoned by the Taiwan Governor-General's Office in mid-September of the 26th year of the Republic (1937) for leading overseas Chinese to return to China. He was repeatedly ordered to initiate the organization of a pro-Japanese overseas Chinese group, but Chen refused. For more than two years, he did not change his original intention. On October 6 of this year, a prison guard gave Chen a potion and released him from prison. The next day, he died suddenly. Fellow villagers collected his body and buried it in the Taipei Sanshan Cemetery. More than 300 people attended the funeral, and although under the surveillance of Japanese police, all shed tears for him. Taiwanese people watching by the roadside also sighed for him, showing how deeply he moved people. Chen's family in Fujian did not receive the bad news until mid-November and held a funeral. Currently, party, government, military, business, and academic organizations and groups, considering Chen's strong integrity and admirable character, and lamenting the death of a loyal and righteous man, will hold a grand memorial service in Fuzhou on December 17 to express their condolences. Chen was a native of Minhou County, currently 48 years old. He became an orphan at the age of 15 and went to Taipei to learn goldsmithing, from apprentice to partner to shop owner. Most of the money he earned in his life was used to handle charitable and public welfare undertakings. In 1922, he first founded the Sanshan Charity Society and the Chinese School in Taipei, with remarkable achievements. In 1926, seeing that overseas Chinese in Taiwan were scattered in various places, with no organizational society and no consulate, like loose sand and subject to bullying, he gathered comrades to organize the Chinese General Association in Taipei, and guided overseas Chinese to set up more than 30 association halls, raising a fund of more than 200,000 yuan, specifically for handling relief and litigation. In 1926, when the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, Chen immediately notified all overseas Chinese organizations and shops in Taiwan to uniformly hang the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, and held entertainment events. This immediately provoked resentment from the Japanese. Then he represented overseas Chinese in returning to China to petition the National Government to establish a Taiwan General Consulate, which was eventually achieved. He then went to Hainan Island to inspect, recognized the necessity of development, and raised capital of 500,000 yuan in Taiwan to organize the Qiongdong Plantation Company, planning to plant rubber and mine minerals. Later, the plan was suspended due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance. When the Shanghai Battle broke out, Chen first sent his family back to Fujian, and then temporarily stayed in Taiwan to assist the consulate in handling the affairs of overseas Chinese returning to China, intending to withdraw with the General Consulate in the end, but unexpectedly he was arrested and martyred, which is also lamentable.

### Chinese Army Attacks Japanese Army Along the Xiaolonghai Railway Line; Fierce Battles on the 7th, 8th, and 9th

Northern Jiangsu Communication: Since the Chinese army recaptured Xinba Wangzhuang near Donghai last month, the Chinese army has been unusually active recently. The Zhang Yi troops of the Chinese army, which are responsible for guerrilla warfare along the Xiaolonghai Railway, have recently cooperated with local guerrillas to repeatedly attack the Japanese army in Baitabu Niushan. The battles have been particularly fierce. The battle situation of the past few days is recorded as follows: After dusk on the 7th, Zhang Yi sent a part of his strong troops, led by Regiment Commander Li, to rush to a certain place overnight to make arrangements. Then, they attacked the Japanese army in Baitabu. At the same time, another part was sent to feign an attack on the Japanese army in Donghai to exert a restraining influence. The Japanese army in Luofeng was attacked by a local guerrilla team. Zhang Yi also accompanied a certain regimental commander to personally command on the front line. At 10:00 pm that night, the arrangements were completed, and the attack on the Japanese army began. At that time, the Japanese army had already fallen asleep. In a hurry, they relied on the terrain to resist. The Chinese army, ambushing in a certain place, simultaneously bombarded fiercely with small mortars. The morale of the Chinese army was particularly high, and they threw hand grenades fiercely at the Japanese, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army charged and killed near Luofeng, attacking from both sides, capturing a lot. When dawn was approaching, the Chinese army safely withdrew after the mission was completed. In this battle, more than 70 Japanese soldiers were killed, and more than 100 to 200 were lightly and seriously injured. On the 8th, the Chinese army continued to attack the Japanese army in Caopu and Niushan. In view of the loss last night, the Japanese army immediately reinforced with more than 500 troops from Donghai to defend the two towns and build fortifications, holding firmly without coming out. At the same time, sent sentries to strictly guard and cut off transportation. The Chinese army, seeing that they were stubbornly defending, changed their plans to consume the Japanese army. They selected strong soldiers, carrying a large number of hand grenades, sneaked into the Japanese army's positions, and threw them fiercely. The villagers in the Pingmingzhuang, Baitabu, and Niushan areas were greatly excited by the Chinese army's repeated victories in attacking the Japanese army in the past month. They specifically held a military-civilian joint celebration meeting in a certain place on a certain day to connect feelings and ensure that the military and the people were integrated. The villagers even made an embroidered banner and presented it to Zhang Yi to express their love and support.

### Japanese Army in Northern Guangdong Fiercely Attacks Yuantan in Three Routes; Bloody Battle at Wangzishan; Japanese Planes Bombard Wildly and Cruelly

Shaoguan Communication: Fierce battles have recently occurred in the southern section of the Yuehan Railway. The Japanese army of more than 1,000 in Yinzhan'ao Longtang, after days of rest, planned to advance north again. On the 7th, 2,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery were reinforced from Juntian with 11 light and heavy artillery pieces. At 2:00 am on the 8th, they attacked Yuantan in three routes. The left wing attacked Dalian from the Rams Snake Mountain northeast of Longtang, the central route attacked Yingzui head-on from the front of the railway, and the right wing attacked Jianfengling from Shangxiashixia. Each advanced with a highly mechanized unit as cover. The Chinese army lined up to meet the attack separately, launching fierce battles. At dawn, six Japanese planes took turns bombing Dalian, Yingzui, Changgang, and Da Mao Shan. Chinese army officers personally commanded, morale was high, and by noon the Japanese army had reinforced again. In order to avoid excessive sacrifices, the Chinese army temporarily withdrew from Yingzui and changed to defend the mountains south of Yuantan. After the Japanese infantry and cavalry invaded Yingzui and other places, they continued to advance north, attempting to break through the Chinese army's Yuantan defense line. However, the Chinese army advanced wave after wave, standing firm. In the area north of Dalian to Wangzishan Jianfengling, there were fierce clashes with the Japanese army. More than 500 Japanese infantry and cavalry repeatedly tried to break into the Chinese positions on Wangzishan (south of Yuantan). The Chinese army, occupying high ground, fired fiercely and engaged in melee combat three or four times. The Japanese army could not succeed, leaving two or three hundred bodies. In the evening, the Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a brave counterattack, once defeating the Japanese army. However, after a short while, the Japanese army reinforced again and attacked again. At night, the Wangzishan area was still in a mixed battle. On the morning of the 9th, the Japanese army continued to reinforce, still attacking Yuantan in three routes. The Chinese army had severely defeated the Japanese army in the Jin Gou Zhen and Da Mao Ling areas, causing hundreds of casualties to the Japanese and puppet troops. The heaviest loss was the Japanese army's San Cai detachment. After the Da Mao Ling battle, only three or four hundred soldiers of the unit remained, and they were defeated and fled towards Changgang, attempting to reorganize the remnants and then decide on reinforcements. Currently, in addition to the three or four hundred troops of the San Cai unit in Changgang, the rest are all puppet troops, numbering thousands. There is also a Japanese army food station, storing a large amount of food. The source of the miscellaneous grains and rice is from looting in various villages. Judging from the recent battles on the front of the Yuehan Railway, the Japanese army's harassment is quite rapid. The Japanese army first attacked Yinzhan'ao from Juntian, and now they are attacking Wangzishan and attempting to break into Yuantan. Currently, the two sides are fighting in the outskirts of Yuantan. The Japanese army has only obtained a straight-line traffic point. Also, on the afternoon of the 9th, there was still a fierce battle between Wangzishan and Jishitian. Another unit engaged in mixed combat in Mengtian, and the battle was extremely fierce. The Japanese army used air and ground forces to attack until the unit at Mengtian was destroyed by the Japanese aircraft and once transferred, until the Japanese air forces were ineffective in the evening the Chinese forces then staged a counterattack at Mengtian, and simultaneously bombed Jishitian, and subsequently captured Mengtian. In response to this victorious momentum the Chinese forces proceeded to then attacked Jishitian, On the 8th the Japanese continued to heavily and repeatedly bomb the Yuehan Railway south sector the areas including the Yuebei Qingyuan, Yingde, Fogang areas in a scheme to restrain the Chinese army reinforcements, from the date of commencement a total of nineteen Japanese machines were launched, among which a large proportion of the areas surrounding Yingzui, Yuanpiao, Pajiang, Feilaixia, and the Qingyin highway routes were the worst hit, with a statistical amount of over a hundred missiles launched, and the destruction of innumerable civil buildings, and severe losses incurred. The Japanese forces pursued and attacked the civil water craft along the Bei River and consequently the civilians on the front lines are actively evacuating, the Chinese various road reinforcements are actively coming to aid.

### Chinese Army in Jiaxing Once Captured the County Seat

Jiaxing Communication: The Chinese army stationed in the XX area north of Jiaxing was ordered to attack the county town a few days ago. They boarded farmer boats and sailed to the outskirts of the city, then attacked the pseudo-police station in Zayen. The pseudo-police, seeing this, abandoned their weapons and fled. The Chinese army did not pursue them and continued to advance towards the Yuehe River in the city. The Japanese and puppet troops and police there heard the news and relied on fortifications to resist stubbornly. The Chinese army fought bravely and finally repelled the Japanese and puppet troops. The Chinese army then recovered the Beidou area of the county town. Later, because the mission had been completed, they withdrew to their original positions. It is heard that seven Japanese and puppet troops and police were killed in this battle, and the pseudo-police patrol chief Jin Sheng was also captured.

### Charity Basketball Championship Changes Hands; Americans Win the Shenbao Cup; Chinese Team's Performance Last Night Showed Considerable Improvement; Result: Defeated Again 34 to 62; Third Game Tonight at 8 PM

The championship of the Third Shenbao Cup Sino-US Charity Basketball Tournament has fallen into the hands of the Americans. After the Chinese team was defeated in the first game, they reorganized their lineup and supplemented their best players. Unfortunately, the strength of this year's American team is exceptionally strong. In the second game last night, the Chinese team was defeated 34 to 62. In the first half, the situation was tense, with a strong defense, 13 to 25, only a difference of eight points. Since the American team has won two games in a row, the Shenbao Cup has been taken by them. It is not a problem to change hands temporarily. We will compete again next year. The third game tonight, although it is no longer related to the championship, will still be held as usual. The game will start at 8 PM, an hour later than the previous two games. At that time, the Chinese team may change its strategy and use surprise tactics to win.

Stalemate Lasted for Two Minutes

Last night, the American team initially took the court, still with the same five players of the McLain White team. The Chinese team's first line was Xianglong, Wen Kui, Nan Qun, Zhong En, and Bang Zhen. In the center jump ball, the ball was won by Changlu, who quickly passed it to Xianglong, who immediately reached the basket. Unexpectedly, Saqin Tuo Xie Li wore through, and Xianglong returned without success. Then Wang Nan Qun took a free throw, but missed the target. The Chinese team lightly lost the opportunity to open the record first. The stalemate lasted for as long as two minutes. Both sides' defenses were particularly tight, but Baodu Xue still opened the record. Saqin Tuo and Ke Lisi consecutively scored, taking a 6-0 lead. Although the Chinese team successively sent Da Mao and Shao Qing to replace Zhong En and A Kui, the formation was still loose, causing the American team's score to continue to increase. In an instant, it became a 13-0 disparity. It was not until Passko fouled and Sun Hui Pei made a free throw that the dull atmosphere was broken.

Tense Atmosphere, Golden Age

Seeing success, the Chinese team's morale suddenly became strong. Shao Qing shot, Wang and Sun made two free throws, and it was a natural success. A Kui stole a cold meal, and Bang Zhen and Nan Qun added more icing on the cake, successively adding more than 13 points, 14 to 19. The Chinese team quickly caught up, only five points behind. The atmosphere of the whole venue was greatly tense. This was the most prosperous period of the Chinese team last night. It is a pity that the Chinese team could not take the opportunity to rise to the top. Xu Wen Kui's godlike shooting was not godlike, missing the basket as many as seven times. Shao Qing and Nan Qun also repeatedly missed sure-shot opportunities. Although Passko of the American team had been ejected due to four fouls, and sharpshooter Henry Schweitz had entered the lane, but fate was the same for the Chinese. The misses were no less than ten times, causing the battle situation to stagnate for six or seven minutes. When the first half ended, the American team had 23 and the Chinese team had 15, the score was very close, with a difference of only eight points.

Changing Baskets and Fighting Again, the Situation Gradually Became Unfavorable

During the break, the West Qing Health Club still had a light and beautiful parallel bar performance, which won warm applause. Changing baskets and fighting again, the American team made a large adjustment, sending in new troops to the front line. Carson was also among those drafted, but because of Xianglong's close surveillance, there was no achievement at first. Although the Chinese team had many shooting opportunities, in the end, the ball luck was not good, so that even the so-called godlike shooter Xu Wen Kui missed with only a millimeter difference. However, the American team's sharpshooter Henry Schweitz was resourceful, making five out of five shots. With Robert Wanxu's two free throws, the score rose sharply. On the Chinese team's side, only Xianglong and A Kui scored four points. At this point, it became 38 to 19, the score differing by half.

Xianglong Fouled Out, the Overall Situation Was Lost

The Chinese team's frequent movements also gave people an opportunity. After Da Mao made a throw and a free throw, Ting Huel and Carson both made great contributions. Ke Lisi even used his tall body to invade again and again, 40 to 21. Xianglong committed four fouls and was fouled out of the court. The Chinese team became even more decadent. Xu Wen Kui once regained his penetrating skills. After 54 to 25, he shot successfully. Da Mao also added three points. Unexpected success is easily lost. The American team scored four goals in a row, and the recovery became hopeless. Xu Wen Kui lightly stretched his ape arm and hit two targets in a row. The bell had rung, and the Chinese team finally suffered a second defeat with 34 against 62.

### New New Handicap Dartball

Zhu Qiliang wins over Bao Qiyun (800) 800-691. 5,460 people designated; 1,048 people assigned; 4,556 admitted students distributed; 235 students admitted without examination distributed.

The number of assigned students in the table above excludes the Shanghai region, as the Shanghai registration forms have not yet been sent, and the candidates' preferences are unknown. Therefore, the admitted students from the Shanghai region cannot be included in the distribution. Also, the situation in Shanghai is unique, so a separate distribution method will have to be determined. According to the figures in the table above, more than one-half of the students were assigned according to their first choice, and one-eighth each were assigned according to their second and third choices. The assigned students accounted for one-quarter of the total. The reason for the assignment is that the preferences were too concentrated. In terms of schools, the majority concentrated on Central University and Southwest Associated University, and in terms of departments, almost all concentrated on engineering. (See details in the following section.) Due to the over-concentration of preferences, the number of assigned students increased. However, I can solemnly report that the scope of the assignment was handled in accordance with the aforementioned standards and was approved by the subcommittee specially formed by the Unified Commission. Among the 1,048 people, 895 people were still assigned to the departments they preferred, but to different schools. The remaining 153 people were assigned to departments with very similar characteristics, seeking to accommodate the students' preferences as much as possible in this difficult situation. As for the total number of distributed students, it is still about twenty people short of the total capacity of the various schools. With the exception of a few schools, most have not yet reached their quota. This is because there are too few applicants for the departments of literature, science, agriculture, and commerce, while there are too many applicants for the various engineering departments and the departments of political science, economics, railway management, etc. Therefore, the total number of students assigned to each school cannot reach its quota. A table listing the departments to which the admitted students have been assigned is provided below. (To be continued)

### Jiangsu Education Department Rectifies: Provincial Nantong Middle School Replaces Principal and Issues Notice to Students

The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department's Shanghai Office recently removed Feng Yue, the acting principal of Provincial Nantong Middle School, from his post due to his improper attitude and inappropriate measures. Although a notice was published to clarify everything, criticisms from society were still frequent, and the school's excellent teachers left the school one after another, resulting in many absences. Disputes among students also occurred from time to time, and the order was unstable. In order to rectify the school, he was dismissed and Xia Shichang, a teacher at the school, was appointed to act as the principal. However, Feng has not yet complied with the order to hand over the school, so on the 19th of this month, he issued a notice to the students of the school, declaring that any certificates issued by Feng Jiji in the future will be invalid, and ordering them to await the new acting principal to carry out the school's reorganization.

### Grain: The Long-Troubled Rice Market Now Expected to Gradually Return to Normal; Reports Indicate Blocked Sources Under Negotiation; Speculators Nervous, Gradually Selling Off Stockpiles; As Long as Shanghai Market Stabilizes, Production Prices Will Immediately Fall; Rice Price of 30 Yuan Per Stone Still Offers Profit

The rice market, after rectification, is now gradually returning to normal. However, what still feels insufficient is that the inland sources are still monopolized by a certain party, exporting and transporting rice to relieve the rice shortage in their country. It is reported that the number of rice to be purchased from the inland is initially set at 3 million stones, resulting in a shortage of rice sources in Shanghai in the past half-month. The reliance on huge amounts of foreign rice continuously arriving in Shanghai has alleviated concerns about the food supply for the local people. It is reported that efforts to unblock the inland sources are being negotiated with a certain party, and it is expected that a breakthrough will be achieved soon. It is also heard that the Adjustment Committee is planning to order huge amounts of foreign rice to suppress the rice price. The future of the rice market should have the hope of seeing the clouds clear and the sun shine, and restoring brightness in the shortest possible time.

The harvests in Wuxi and other places are not bad this year, and there is no risk of rice shortage within half a year. Shanghai rice merchants make excuses for scarce sources, or blocked sources, as if only allowing prices to rise freely can ensure rice to eat. However, it is not known that the production areas have no intention of blocking the rice. Because the rice price in Shanghai has risen too sharply, the rice merchants in the production areas are green with envy and are hoarding and transporting rice, hoping to make a fortune. This has caused prices in the production areas to rise constantly, leading to attention and restrictions. If the rice price in Shanghai can fall to within 30 yuan, then the production areas will inevitably fall accordingly. At a reasonable selling price, there will naturally be no restrictions on transportation. For example, if the rice price in Wuxi is 16 yuan, plus 4 yuan for packaging and transportation by the transportation company, and another 4 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, the cost to Shanghai is only 24 yuan. Selling it for 30 yuan is already a very good profit. Why must it be hoarded again and again, rising horizontally and vertically, causing panic? (Person)

Yesterday, the operation of the local rice market returned to its previous state. In the morning, the local shops, which had been virtually suspended for several days, urgently needed to replenish their stock. The merchants had a lot of remaining goods from the previous period and also sought to quickly sell them off, selling at a mutually agreeable price. Speculators were even more eager to unload their burdens. All three parties were entering and exiting at the same time, resulting in a large number of transactions. As a result, the market prices for all goods, except for Saigon rice, which had the largest sales volume and experienced slight fluctuations, were quoted according to the limited price. In particular, the Jiangsu white rice from Yanji and others was dumped in large quantities.

Customer’s indica rice’s arrivals and sales were sluggish. The market was flooded with foreign rice, leading to a price drop. The Jiangbei Wuhu market goods were still open at a limited price of 33 yuan, with the possibility of lowering it by three to five cents. However, Nanjing and special high-quality enamel were rarely sold. The total transaction for the day was only several hundred bags.

Although the foreign price of foreign rice has slightly decreased, the asking price of Saigon foreign merchants is still 47 and a half yuan to 48 yuan, making it difficult to sell. However, the original packaged goods on the road have slightly improved, with prices ranging from 42 yuan 70 cents to 43 yuan. The spot market is 36 yuan 30 cents to 35 yuan, which is also about half a yuan higher than the previous day. As the sales channels are gradually becoming active, the city is gradually switching back to rural continuation, the market is turning around, and the zero and wholesale transactions for the day amount to three to four thousand bags.

Wuxi Correspondence: This county is a rice-producing area and a rice hub. All rice transported from Jiangyin, Changzhou, Yixing, Liyang, and other counties stays in this county. Its importance is no less than Wuhu and Shanghai. In previous years, rice prices, once new rice appeared, often fell sharply. In recent years, the highest price of new rice was no more than 10 yuan, with highs and lows of only five or six yuan. This year, due to special circumstances, in this autumn of new rice, rice prices did not fall but instead rose. In September and October, new rice sold for 18 or 19 yuan per stone, and in October and November, it fell to about 16 yuan. Afterwards, it began to surge. It was expected to gradually fall, but the opposite was true, and it gradually rose, reaching the current high price of 20 yuan. The reason for this is nothing more than rice merchants hoarding and manipulating the market, taking advantage of the scarcity to raise prices. Due to the unrest in the area, farmers are afraid of storing white rice, which can easily attract attention, so most have not yet sold their rice, but have adopted the method of gradually milling and selling it. This can reduce the risk, which is exploited by rice merchants, creating the main factor for this price increase. This year's harvest in this county was slightly damaged due to excessive rainfall, so the situation is uneven. The abundant harvests (mostly in high-lying fields) can yield two stones eight or nine per acre, while the poor harvests (mostly in low-lying fields) yield only one stone five or six. The average is about 70% of a good harvest. The so-called 70% means that in a full harvest year, each acre can yield three stones of white rice, which is commonly known as "one acre three burdens." If it is 70%, it is about two stones. Traditionally, farmers engage in milling and selling rice after harvesting, and the vast majority can complete it before the winter solstice. Hence the saying, "Taste the winter solstice dumplings." Rice prices fall the most at this time. This year, due to the current situation, normal practices cannot be followed, resulting in the quantity of rice stored in the warehouses in the urban and rural areas, which used to be 1 or 2 million loads, now being only 200,000 loads. With such a thin base, rice merchants can take the opportunity to manipulate the market. Although the difficulties in transportation and heavy taxes are facts, they are not as serious as the rice merchants claim. As far as we know, except for large quantities of rice that may inevitably encounter unexpected obstacles, for civilian ship transportation and smaller amounts, if the procedures are complete, there is no major problem. The people in the industry are already familiar with these procedures. There are no fixed rules for the taxes paid, and they are mostly determined according to the circumstances. According to transport merchants, the actual tax paid per stone of rice is about two to four jiao, and half for grain. However, there are many places to collect taxes, often requiring multiple payments before reaching the destination. When rice prices rose most sharply this time, it would sell for 21 yuan per stone, which is almost three times higher than in the past. Export was prohibited, and a limited price was set, which slightly stabilized it. (Hui)

### Wheat Mill Turnaround Sluggish; Flour Prices Already Difficult to Get Good

Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour mill price was 8 yuan and 70 cents for the No. 2 authentic brand. The retail trade in this street was quite active, because the price of rice is expensive, the demand for flour is higher, and the factories can supply as much as possible to maintain the local people's food supply. However, customer sales are considered ordinary. According to Qingdao customers, each bag of flour sold in that area loses two yuan and seventy or eighty cents. Moreover, the oil market is sluggish, and the demand is even lower. Tianjin gangs also consider transportation unprofitable, and the number of people entering is very small. The total market transaction is called 10,000 bags. Except for local sales, the Nanyang gang only handles a little. The Japanese mill flour first weakened and then tightened. December Phoenix brand 8 yuan 1 jiao 4 cents, January 8 yuan 4 jiao 6 cents to 8 cents.

Wheat: Yesterday the market first tightened and then weakened. The sources are slightly decorated, and the costs are high. Everyone is thinking of selling at a good price, but the factory turnaround is sluggish, because the customer sales are currently difficult to be prosperous, only maintaining the local street. Flour prices are also difficult to get good, so prices are cut to get. The sellers are still struggling. As a result, the factory handles only 2,000 bags, the highest price is still 15 yuan. The middle class has decreased slightly. It is said that the goods transported from various places will soon arrive in Shanghai one after another, coupled with the imminent arrival of the lunar new year, so the market already feels loose.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Prices Fall Sharply; The Most It Fell Was Twenty Yuan Per Load

The soybean oil market, which had been stagnant for a long time, has revealed a sharp decline, and the downturn is difficult to reverse. Yesterday, the general hoarders were difficult to support and had to sell openly. As a result, except for Northeast barrel oil, which had no market, the rest all opened. The formal market price was about 20 yuan lower than the highest record (7th market). However, buying momentum turned strong in the afternoon, and the closing price had recovered three yuan. The statistics show that 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 71 yuan, 100 pieces of Qingqi oil were traded at a price of 72 yuan, 150 pieces of Yanqi oil were traded at a price of 73 yuan to 75 yuan, 76 barrels of Jiangbei barrel oil were traded at a price of 96 yuan to 100 yuan, more than 1,000 loads of local factory oil were traded at a price of 77 yuan, and 39 barrels of Changzhou barrel oil were traded at a price of 97 yuan.

### Finance: Exchange Market Re-Enters a Hovering State

The exchange market yesterday did not fluctuate in HSBC listings. The black market for British and American exchange rates has entered a hovering state, and the changes are not significant. It was tight first and then recovered. The opening price in the morning was average. Afterwards, the Hua Shang yarn and flower gangs first came to buy, and the Chinese banks also ate in at the same time. In addition, the foreign banks' supply was weak, and the latent trend became tighter. By 9:50, it had shrunk to 4 pence 609375 and 7 yuan 5625. Then, as the speculation gradually subsided, the situation suddenly turned stable. This continued until noon. Suddenly, a telegram came from Hong Kong, so the situation recovered slightly. Until the noon close, it was 4 pence 65625 and 7 yuan 65625, which was slightly tighter by 03125 compared with the previous day. The trend of futures is no different from that of spot goods. However, this month, because the delivery is approaching, it has been flattened.

Yarn and Flower Gangs Still Selling In

At the beginning of the morning, London's big articles, both near and far, shrank by 0625. New York silver prices rose by one point, London's raw gold remained fixed, and the exchange rate of British versus American versus French was the same. The exchange rate against Shanghai was slightly 0625. The exchange rates of American versus British, Shanghai, and French were all the same. The bank opened the selling price of spot goods in the morning. The British gold was 4 pence 6875, and the American exchange rate was 7 yuan 6875, which was neither good nor bad compared with the previous close. After opening, the Hua Shang yarn and flower gangs first came to pull out and settle. At the same time, the Chinese banks also slightly ate in. However, due to the lack of interest in supply from foreign banks, the latent trend immediately tightened. By 9:45, the British gold had shrunk to 4 pence 609375, and the American exchange rate had also softened to 7 yuan 5625. The HSBC listing was announced without any movement, and the white silver balance tax was announced slightly 0.25. After that, there were fewer people pulling out, and the situation turned stable. As noon was approaching, a telegram suddenly came from Hong Kong, so it recovered slightly. Extending to the noon close, the bank's spot selling price was 4 pence 65625 for British gold and 7 yuan 65625 for the American exchange rate, which was slightly tighter by 03125 than the morning opening.

The Market Situation in the Afternoon Was Quite Quiet

The market situation in the afternoon was extremely dull. At first, the situation was slightly loose in the calm. British gold was 4 pence 65625 and the American exchange rate was 7 yuan 6875, which could be settled once. Later, speculators slightly pulled out long-term, and it turned slightly tighter. After entering, the Chinese banks slightly sold out, and it returned to average. Until the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was 4 pence 65625 for British gold and 7 yuan 65625 for the American exchange rate. The price of this month was the same as that of spot goods. The British gold was 4 pence 625 in January, and the American exchange rate was 7 yuan 53125. As a result, compared with the previous day, the spot British and American exchange rates were each tighter by 03125. The central government was 015625 tighter this month, and the American exchange rate was neither good nor bad. The result in January was comparable to that of spot goods.

No Rise or Fall in the Hong Kong Exchange Market

Hong Kong, 21st: The exchange market opened steadily this morning. The exchange rates were the same compared with the noon close yesterday. At 10:50, the Shanghai exchange rate rose by two yuan to 320 yuan. At 11:30, there was no rise or fall. The market opened at 2:30 pm, and there was also no rise or fall.

Tianjin's British and American Currencies Are Still Tight

Tianjin, 21st: The exchange market opened averagely this morning. The British exchange rate shrunk by 0625 to 4 pence 4375, and the American exchange rate tightened by 125 to 7 yuan 25. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by half a yuan to 105 yuan. The black market for "Joint Notes" was 7 jiao and a half higher at 93 yuan.

### Gold Speculation: Though Rising, Still Slight

Yesterday, the cash cooked red (gold) dark market conditions, with the exchange rate stable but slightly softening, large buyers from Hong Kong took the opportunity to buy low. However, amidst these favorable conditions, a certain Yu firm was aggressively speculating (settling forward foreign exchange and selling cooked red). High prices were difficult to sustain, but ultimately, the price still managed to rise by sixteen yuan. As for the day's process, it initially opened up twenty-six yuan at 4,170 yuan, due to tight foreign exchange rates. A certain money exchange firm was the first to buy. However, as the exchange rate remained tight and soft, coupled with Hong Kong interests entrusting a certain money exchange to manipulate the market, the price was pushed up to a peak of 4,185 yuan. Subsequently, as the exchange rate stabilized and buying momentum waned, gold firms and silversmiths mutually dumped their holdings, causing the price to fall back. Around noon, the exchange rate hardened again, and a certain bank aggressively sold on behalf of its clients, driving the price down to a low of 4,149 yuan before the close. Fortunately, Hong Kong interests saw the low price and bought again, so the noon close was still 4,158 yuan. The afternoon opened higher, but soon gold firms dumped their holdings, and a certain money exchange firm re-entered the market, resulting in an evening close of 4,160 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was about 1,600 taels. There was no change in silversmiths' jewelry gold, and customs gold remained stable.

### Yarn and Cotton: Buying on Dips Despite Lack of Forward Buying; Yarn Market Rebounds; Shuangma Rises by Ten Yuan

After two days of decline, the yarn market rebounded yesterday. Although the overseas cotton market remained weak, local industry players unanimously held a positive outlook and were eager to buy on dips. News that a stock exchange would be established in Tianjin spurred buying interest in 20-count yarn. Some speculated that the exchange rate would be adjusted, leading to increased buying. However, actual demand remained weak for most counts except for 32-count and 42-count yarn. Generally, prices rose when buyers entered the market after several days of decline, and then retreated when those who profited from the earlier rise dumped their holdings.

### Extraterritorial Road Construction Negotiations Have Not Yet Reached a Stage of Approximation; The Bureau's Intention Is to Firmly Reject the Countermeasures; The Puppet Government May Submit a Reply Next Week

Regarding the negotiations on extraterritorial road construction, the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) submitted a reply to the puppet municipal government on the 19th, the content of which was to reject the puppet's demands. Yesterday, continuing inquiries from various sources revealed that, in addition to rejecting the puppet municipal government's "counter-proposal" of November 11, the Bureau still left room for concessions, so that the negotiations could continue.

The Situation of this Case Is Very Tense

The extraterritorial road dispute reached an extreme point in the autumn of this year. With the support of the Japanese, the puppet municipal government insisted on a so-called "comprehensive" takeover of the extraterritorial roads. In late October, through the mediation of Consul-General Colonel Narońi, the two sides entered into negotiations. The SMC first drafted a proposed plan as a basis for discussion. Both parties refused to disclose the contents of the SMC's proposed plan, which was delivered to the puppet mayor on November 2.

The Initial Proposal of the Bureau

Inquiries from various sources finally revealed that, regarding the issue of donations and taxes, the SMC's proposal was to establish a separate special agency to collect donations and taxes on the extraterritorial roads, and to create a separate special account. The staff of the donation and tax agency would be appointed by both the concession authorities and the puppet municipal government. The same approach would be taken for the police power in the area, with police officers from both sides jointly stationed and patrolling.

The Puppet Government's Counter-Proposal Has Been Rejected

The above-mentioned proposed plan was submitted by Chuan Xiaonai on November 11 as a "counter-proposal," the content of which, in addition to adding opinions to the SMC's proposal, also included other terms and conditions proposed unilaterally by the puppet side. After careful consideration, the SMC decided to reject these demands and drafted a reply, which was personally delivered to Chuan Xiaonai by SMC Chairman Fessenden during a visit on the 19th of this month. This rejection reply still leaves a wide margin for discussion. It is believed that the puppet mayor may make another reply next week.

The Future Situation Remains to Be Developed

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that a certain morning newspaper reported that the SMC had rejected the "mayor" Fu Xiaoan's counter-proposal on extraterritorial road construction. SMC Director-General and President Fessenden denied this this morning (the 21st). He stated, "This statement is completely inaccurate." However, Fessenden refused to disclose the nature of the SMC's reply handed over on Tuesday evening. Fessenden also did not explain whether the SMC's reply contained any modifications to Chuan's counter-proposal or any new suggestions as a supplement. When asked by reporters whether he believed that the negotiations between the SMC and the "municipal government" on extraterritorial road construction would be resolved soon, Fessenden stated that he hoped so, as did many others.

### Coal Briquettes Rise in Price Again

Starting from the 21st of this month, (1) the wholesale price will be 75 yuan per ton, plus 2 yuan for transportation; (2) the door-to-door sales price will be 4.2 yuan per dan (100 jin). It is reported that Yi Taixing still quotes 4 yuan per dan.

### Central Farmers' New Auxiliary Coin Vouchers Will Be Shipped to Shanghai in the Amount of 500,000; The Exact Number of Central Bank's Jiao Notes Shipped to Shanghai Is Hundreds of Thousands; Three Batches of Fractional Currency Will Arrive and Be Issued Strictly; The Limit for Each Person Carrying Legal Tender to Shanghai Is 200 Yuan

In order to alleviate the panic of the lack of fractional currency, auxiliary currency, and one-yuan notes in the Shanghai market, the Ministry of Finance has approved the Central Bank's printing of fractional currency vouchers and the issuance of already printed auxiliary currency vouchers in moderation, and has requested the Joint Office of the Four Banks to instruct the banks to quickly ship one-yuan notes to the Shanghai market in moderation to aid adjustment. The restriction on individuals carrying legal tender to Shanghai remains strict. The details are as follows:

Jiao Notes

Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired with the Central Bank and learned that: (1) Two batches of fractional currency vouchers worth 500,000 yuan will be issued soon, and the third batch of five-fen vouchers worth 500,000 yuan will be issued in conjunction with the second batch. However, in order to prevent the inflow into occupied areas and storage for profit, a gradual issuance system is adopted, and applications will be strictly reviewed; (2) A large batch of one-yuan notes from HSBC, the Central Bank, and other banks has arrived and is being exchanged by the Central Bank, with a temporary limit of 20 yuan per person. They are now widely circulating in the market; (3) It is confirmed that 100,000 yuan of auxiliary currency vouchers (one-jiao and two-jiao notes issued by the Central Bank) were transported to Shanghai by the British firm HSBC the day before yesterday. The rumor that 2 million yuan was transported to Shanghai by the Changxing Company's Russian Empress is unfounded. According to investigations, the ship arrived in Shanghai on the 17th of this month and did not carry any auxiliary currency vouchers to Shanghai. Therefore, the report that the Central Bank will exchange them today is absolutely inaccurate. However, the Chinese Farmers Bank does have 500,000 yuan of new auxiliary currency vouchers that will be shipped to Shanghai from Hong Kong on a foreign ship, but the date of shipment has not yet been telegraphed.

Fractional Currency

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce had previously received letters from the silk and satin and restaurant associations requesting that the Central Bank of China, Shanghai Branch, be allowed to distribute fractional currency vouchers on behalf of the associations. After requesting a discretionary allocation, they received a reply from the Central Bank stating that: "After investigating, this bank's decision to continue issuing fractional currency was not published in any newspaper announcement. However, prior to the issuance, various trade associations sent letters requesting registration. As the number of notes issued is limited, and the number requested for registration is very large, distribution is difficult. It was replied that a discretionary allocation would be made when the time came. The so-called discretionary allocation does not specify that the exchange will be carried out by various trade associations on behalf of the members. Since the issuance began, almost all merchants have applied for exchange themselves. This bank has reviewed and replied to each application separately, and the merchants have gradually exchanged the specified amounts according to the prescribed dates. If the exchange is carried out by the trade associations on behalf of the members, it would not only be redundant, but this bank would also not have a large amount of fractional currency to meet the demand. It is requested that your association forward the reply to the members and instruct them to apply for exchange separately, filling in the amount, and this bank will review and reply. In short, this bank has vouchers available for exchange and will exchange them in moderation."

Legal Tender

In order to prevent the outflow of legal tender into occupied areas, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that "anyone carrying legal tender from Wenzhou, Ningbo, Fuzhou in Zhejiang and Fujian, and places near the above-mentioned ports where customs sub-stations are located, to Shanghai, will be limited to 200 yuan per person. The excess amount will be confiscated and used for public purposes to stop the outflow. Those who need to carry more than the limit should remit the funds to a nearby bank." It has been telegraphed to the Zhejiang and Fujian Customs to comply with this regulation. Also recorded below is the joint announcement of the Zhejiang Customs Supervisor and Commissioner of Customs: "After investigating the case of restricting passengers from carrying banknotes out of various ports, each person must not carry more than 500 yuan, and the excess will be confiscated, which has been announced to all in cases No. 89 and No. 92 of this Customs. Now, we continue to receive the telegraphed order from the Ministry of Finance (see above for details). Therefore, we should comply with and handle this matter. As for passengers carrying foreign banknotes from the ports of Zhejiang and Fujian to Shanghai, the previous regulations still apply, and each person must not exceed 30 pounds of English gold, 150 U.S. dollars, or other foreign currencies of equal value. However, if passengers carry a mixture of Chinese and foreign banknotes, the Chinese banknote portion must not exceed 200 yuan. Except for branch banks, we hereby announce this to all merchants for their information."

### All Sectors Will Enthusiastically Commemorate the National Renaissance Day; Yunnan Zhaowei Memorial Will Be Held Simultaneously; Save Expenses by Printing and Selling Commemorative Bookmarks

December 25th is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising and the National Renaissance Day. All sectors in Shanghai will enthusiastically commemorate the day, but without emphasizing formalities. All sectors also believe that the Second Sino-Japanese War is progressing to a favorable stage and are determined to fulfill their responsibilities and quickly complete the great cause of national rejuvenation. The December 5th Zhaowei Uprising Memorial will be combined and held on this day. Silver and money businesses will be closed as usual. This day is also Christmas, and all sectors are promoting economical gifts and donating to refugees. In order to save expenses and eliminate old customs, all sectors plan to print and sell Renaissance Day commemorative bookmarks to replace New Year cards. It is said that there are five types of bookmarks, printed with the President's portrait and the President's aphorisms. The designs are very exquisite, and the price is set at one jiao per type. It is also planned to use the proceeds to fund public charitable undertakings after a certain amount has been collected.

### Tofu Shops Reopen; Price Increase Implemented This Morning

Tofu shops in the two concessions, which had suddenly closed on the 19th to rectify market prices, have distributed the newly set price lists to various businesses and stall vendors. They have also announced that manufacturing work will be resumed from last night, and all businesses will reopen this morning (the 22nd). The new market price for tofu will be calculated in fen, with a minimum price of five fen, which will obviously increase the expenses for ordinary people's staple food.

### Rice Shops in the Two Concessions Resumed Normal Operations Yesterday; A Few Rice Shops Have Not Yet Fully Opened; The Number of Foreign Rice Shipments Has Increased Greatly, and the Market Situation Is Stable

Shanghai West Side Holds Price-Controlled Rice Sales

After the authorities of the two concessions and the rice industry groups took emergency measures to strictly prohibit speculation and manipulation, rice prices in Shanghai have stabilized. Because the source of domestic rice is not smooth, while foreign rice has become more relaxed, rice merchants have ordered foreign rice, resulting in a large increase in the number of foreign rice shipments. Rice shops resumed business yesterday, and price-controlled rice sales were held in Shanghai West Side.

Rice Shops Resumed Business Yesterday

Of the more than 1,000 rice shops in the city, most of them had closed due to the rice rush. Now that rice prices have gradually fallen and the rice rush has subsided, the two concessions ordered the rice shops association to notify all rice shops to resume business. Therefore, most rice shops reopened yesterday as usual. Those shops located in border areas such as Haig Road, which are prone to incidents, are being monitored by patrolmen at all times, and are constantly guarded to prevent unforeseen events.

Price-Controlled Rice Sales Held in Shanghai West Side Yesterday

There are more ordinary people in the western part of Shanghai. Although rice prices have been reduced again to the price limit, the economic situation of the masses is still difficult to cope with. In this severe winter, there is a real concern that people will be forced to go astray due to the pressures of life. Although the rice rush has been suppressed, the panic has not been fundamentally resolved, which is detrimental to local security and peace. It is reported that price-controlled rice was sold at the corner of Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road yesterday. Due to the large number of people, the police specially dispatched armored vehicles to guard the area, and dispatched more than 20 patrolmen to protect it. On the puppet police side, there were also 10-20 guards watching the area.

Number of Foreign Rice Orders Increases Greatly

Because the source of domestic rice is not smooth, Shanghai rice merchants have ordered foreign rice. Therefore, foreign rice shipments have been continuously arriving in Shanghai in recent days. Every day, rice merchants order from Daufu Foreign Firm and others, with numbers ranging from 7,000 to 8,000 bags. The number of foreign rice orders is often between 200,000 and 300,000 bags. Moreover, with the recent stabilization of China's financial situation and the easing of foreign exchange, orders for foreign rice will become more enthusiastic. Because foreign rice accounts for 70-80%, rice prices can be stabilized.

Adjustment Association Prepares to Order Rice

At the first board meeting held on the 21st, the Shanghai Citizens' Food Adjustment Association elected Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jiqing, Guo Shunpei, Pei Yunqing, Wu Yunzhai, and Wang Yuqing as executive directors, and Yu Qiaqing was elected as chairman. It is also planned to add several influential Chinese and Western figures as directors and committee members, which will be announced after discussion by the executive committee. The association's articles of association, substitute foreign rice ordering methods, and fund-raising methods have all been approved and will be printed immediately. It also pushed members to contact the Trust Department of the Jin Cheng Bank to discuss collection matters. Once all procedures are prepared, a public announcement will be made to start registration and all regulations will be announced. It is also reported that the association will convene representatives of various commercial organizations today for the first consultation in order to promote work and obtain practical benefits.

Foreign Media Emphasizes Free Rice Transportation

Foreign media reported that responsible parties claimed yesterday (the 20th) that if illegal profiteers continue their activities and rice cannot be freely transported to the city from rice-producing areas, Shanghai will face a constant "rice crisis." These sources have been cut off, and illegal profiteers, speculators, and hoarders will be rampant again. The joint announcement issued by the authorities of the two concessions has had an impact on the city. The main problem at present is to open up the channels for rice to be transported to Shanghai, and the most important thing is the channels for rice to be transported to Shanghai from the occupied areas. A reporter asked a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council whether the concession authorities had discussed the free transportation of rice through the occupied areas with the Japanese authorities. He stated that the authorities are currently in contact with those involved in this matter or those who can assist.

### British Consul-General to Retire, French Consul Holds Farewell Banquet, Praising Joint British-French Efforts and Wishing the British Consul-General a Safe Journey Home

The "China Press" reports that Sir Philip, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, will soon retire and depart for England. The French Consul-General, Mr. Baurdrez, hosted a farewell banquet at his residence on Saturday evening in honor of Sir Philip. This reiterated the harmony and friendship between the British and French Consuls-General in Shanghai. The arrangement of this farewell banquet differed from usual practice, with Mr. Baurdrez being assisted by the daughter of the French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme.

Welcoming Guests

Happy Retirement

Mr. Baurdrez briefly mentioned the circumstances of the banquet and how Britain and France were once again fighting side-by-side for the same cause. Sir Philip responded by thanking the French Consul-General for his hospitality, praising the competence and benevolence of the French Concession authorities, and stating that he would cherish his time in Shanghai and would never forget it, adding that this joint British-French banquet was also a most memorable occasion. Over thirty British and French guests attended.

### Shanghai Post Office Handles Mail: Sending, Delivery, and Transit Status; Mail Delivery Throughout the Country: Now Smooth and Without Backlog

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the areas of Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou have successively become war zones. Local post offices have been forced to retreat due to the situation. Mail sent from Shanghai to areas along the Yangtze River and the Beiyang and Nanhua lines has been interrupted. Although the Shanghai postal authorities have tried their best to clear the routes, some stagnation is unavoidable. Often, mail from Shanghai to Zhejiang takes months, causing complaints from the outside world and even accusations against postal workers. However, since the Director-General of Posts of the Ministry of Communications telegraphed the Shanghai office to find ways to improve the situation, except for some places where the situation is special, mail sent from Shanghai to various inland offices, and mail delivered or transited by the bureaus along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, are still sent directly according to the usual routes without any backlog. The reporter inquired at the post office and recorded the details of the dispatch as follows:

Mr. Alfred Barnes, a member of the British Parliament, and Mr. Xia Jinlin, a well-known Chinese writer now in London, jointly organized the Sino-British Cooperation Promotion Association. It is said that if the European war had not broken out, the association's plan to raise 100,000 pounds of British funds to lend to the Chinese Gung Ho Association would have

Been successful

The loan sought by the association was intended to purchase production machinery and transport it throughout China, with the Gung Ho Association using the products exported to Britain to repay the loan. As for the American people, they also feel

Great interest

In the progress of the Chinese Gung Ho movement. Because Chinese visitors to the United States and American missionaries returning home on leave are automatically giving speeches in the United States describing the current situation of the progress of Chinese Gung Ho, especially Ms. Ida Pruitt of the Department of Social Work at Peking Union Medical College, who left China before April and traveled through

Major Cities

In the United States to give speeches for the Chinese Gung Ho Association. The communication also stated that the Chinese industrial cooperative movement is now divided into five regions: (1) Sichuan-Xikang region, (2) Northwest region, (3) Southwest region, (4) Yunnan region, and (5) Southeast region. 1,300 teams have already been established.

### Domestic Remittances: Reduce Exchange Rates; Exchange Rates Should Be Uniform Among All Commercial Banks

The Ministry of Finance believes that domestic remittances are one of the important businesses of banks, and exchange fees should be reduced as much as possible to facilitate smooth flow, so as to invigorate finance and promote economic development. Since the outbreak of the war, the exchange rates for domestic remittances among commercial banks have been inconsistent. Although this is due to various factors such as transportation, the number of fees charged by each bank has affected the convenience of merchants and the purpose of invigorating finance. In order to correct this, the ministry has now approved temporary measures to facilitate domestic remittances and sent a letter to the Joint Office of the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China) to instruct their branches across the country to comply. It has also issued a circular to all commercial banks in the country, stating that in the future, the exchange rates for domestic remittances should be determined jointly by local banks based on the distance and cost of the journey, and a list of the exchange rates for remittances to various important cities in the country should be displayed in front of the remittance office in the bank so that remitters can know the rates at any time. At the same time, the remittance rate table and any changes should be reported to the ministry each month for verification.

### Pastor DeKruyter, Arrested by the Japanese, Returns to Shanghai: He Did Not Know the Seriousness of the Current Situation in Japan; Dispute Arose from Distributing Printed Materials

The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that Pastor DeKruyter, secretary of the Far East branch of the World Student Christian Federation, distributed Christian printed materials in Japan. The Japanese authorities believed that these printed materials could promote "dangerous ideas" and detained Mr. DeKruyter. He was subsequently given a suspended sentence and left Japan on the "Taiyo Maru" and arrived in Shanghai today (the 21st). Mrs. DeKruyter and her children greeted him at the customs dock. Mr. DeKruyter told reporters,

"I am returning to Shanghai."

"I am of course much relieved. Apparently, the Japanese police had the right to arrest me for committing an illegal act. I was detained for distributing printed materials, not for speaking. And the printed materials are solid evidence. As for the nature of the printed materials, it is not convenient to discuss, but they are obviously defensive for the maintenance of law and order in Japan. At that time, I did not know that it was illegal and did it unintentionally. But in fact, I had violated two laws, one being the provision in the Army and Navy Law that prohibits the dissemination of

False News

And rumors, and the other being one of the emergency laws, namely, not to distribute "disruptive printed materials." I know that I have committed a crime, and of course I regret it very much. My difficulty lies in not knowing the seriousness of the current situation in Japan. In this critical moment, the government must do its best to maintain unity and support the government's policies. They have repeatedly

Explained

This to me, so it is necessary to prohibit various disruptive printed materials. I was arrested on October 12 and sentenced to four months imprisonment with a one-year suspended sentence on the 16th of this month before being released and gaining complete freedom. If I do not commit a crime again by the end of the year, the judgment will be automatically revoked. During

The Period of Detention

I did not encounter any difficulties or oppression except once. Usually, criminals are escorted out of the police station and into prison, but I was detained at the police station for 51 days, then handed over to the custody of the American Consul General and allowed to choose a hotel to stay in at will. The treatment I received during my detention was quite good." According to Mr. DeKruyter, he has not yet decided on his future plans but intends to stay in Shanghai for a few months.

After the Japanese learned that the scrap iron belonged to Messrs. Mahler & Co. and checked the official customs permit, they immediately released the ship.

A Route 5 public bus of the British China General Omnibus Company, number 15016, was traveling north from the Sanmaoge Bridge on Henan Road at 9:40 a.m. yesterday when the bus suddenly experienced mechanical problems in front of the Dalun Silk Store on Nanjing Road and stopped.

### Tang Xiuying Sued for Fraud: Trial Continued Yesterday, Further Investigation Required

Tang Xiuying, wife of Wei Xinglin, resident of No. 2, Gengyuli, Bubbling Well Road, French Concession, and her elder brother, Tang Jian, allegedly used the false sale of official positions to deceive their fellow villagers Wu Zhenhua, Fang Youcheng, Lou Zhengmin, Yang Zhishan, etc., claiming that the Jianghai Customs planned to set up six posts in the occupied areas to recruit inspectors with a monthly salary of 120 yuan, but they had to pay a 300 yuan activity fee in advance.

### Public Concessions All Public Toilets Yesterday Appealed to All Sectors and Requested the Bureau of Works to Directly Contract

There are currently more than one hundred public toilets in the Public Concession. These public toilets have been contracted by large contractors, and then by small contractors. Each toilet pit employs workers for management, which has been the case for more than ten years. In the past, the contracting fee was only a few hundred yuan per month, but it has gradually increased. Currently, it has increased to a huge amount of seven thousand yuan. The daily income of small contractors relies entirely on toilet paper fees. Recently, due to the high cost of living in Shanghai, everything has become expensive. Each toilet pit feels it is difficult to maintain. Moreover, since the cost of living has increased, the population has greatly dispersed, and the number of people using public toilets has also decreased, resulting in a decrease in income. Small contractors are already very panicked. Unexpectedly, recently the Bureau of Works opened bids for public toilets, and the bidder was the Oriental Cleaning Company, which won the bid with the highest price of 15,180 yuan, exceeding the past contracting fee of 7,000 yuan by more than double. Therefore, all the small contractors were shocked. Because the large contractor has contracted at a high price, it will inevitably increase the contracting fee for small contractors. On the one hand, the current fee for toilet paper is only one cent, and it cannot be increased to two cents to increase income. Therefore, for the sake of their own interests, all the small contractors have jointly petitioned the Bureau of Works to find a way to maintain the situation, or allow them to directly contract, so as to avoid separation. Currently, they have already filed a petition once. It is learned that yesterday all the small contractors again appealed to organizations such as the Chinese Ratepayers Association and all sectors for relief.

### Kang Yi Lane Rent Increase Dispute Resolved Tenants to Appropriately Increase Water Fees

The houses in Kang Yi Lane, Kang Ti Road, in the French Concession, are the property of the Zhu family, and are managed by the Ji Yi Real Estate Company. Recently, the landlord notified all tenants that due to the increase in water and electricity, the rent would be increased by 30% starting from October of this year. If they did not agree, they would have to move out of the house within one month. All the tenants believed that during this extraordinary period, a huge rent increase was difficult to bear, so they specifically requested the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association to uphold justice and find a way to stop it. It is learned that the case has been forwarded by the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association to the landlord, requesting consideration of the current difficulties and exemption from the increase. Yesterday, the association also convened representatives from both parties to discuss the matter. As a result, the water surcharge was appropriately increased, and the matter has been peacefully resolved.

### Xinmin Village Deadline for Rent Increase Tenants Extremely Angry Advocate for Serious Negotiations

The landlord of the houses in Xinmin Village, Ma Lang Road, is Qian Yiru, a wealthy merchant from Suzhou who is currently the assistant manager of the Trust Department of the Continental Bank. Recently, he wanted to increase the rent, but before discussing and deciding with the tenants, he suddenly ordered the rental accountant to notify the tenants on the day before yesterday (the 20th) that the water fee would be increased by eight yuan per building per month, and that they had to agree by the 27th of this month, otherwise the water supply would be stopped. Most of the tenants in the village have lived there for about ten years, and the rent has been paid on a monthly basis. Now, during this time of national crisis, Mr. Qian disregards the difficulties of the tenants and threatens to cut off the water supply. All the tenants are extremely angry, and unanimously advocate for refusal and serious negotiations.

### On Increasing Tuition Fees

— Xin Meng

Due to the high cost of everything and increased expenses, some private schools in Shanghai had already increased their tuition fees once in the second semester of this year. However, in recent months, the rise in prices has continued without limit, causing the expenses of various schools to exceed their budgets again. Under these circumstances, it is said that many private schools will increase tuition fees again after the winter vacation ends and school starts in the new year. Schools are increasing tuition fees amidst the soaring prices to cover their huge expenses, and we certainly cannot criticize them for this. However, on the other hand, we cannot ignore whether parents can bear the increased burden of their children's education.

Frankly speaking, many private schools in Shanghai already charge tuition fees that are not considered low. Even without an increase, under today's circumstances, most parents will find it difficult to bear the burden. How much more so with repeated increases, which will force children in school to drop out midway! Among the salaried class in the city, how many have a monthly income of more than one hundred yuan? Under today's circumstances, can those with incomes below one hundred yuan spare a portion for their children's tuition fees? They know that when their children reach school age, they should send them to school, but without money, they cannot enter school and can only watch their children be deprived of an education. Isn't it contrary to the purpose of education to increase the number of children who drop out of school due to increased tuition fees?

Here, we are not saying that we do not sympathize with school principals incurring debts due to increased tuition fees. What we hope is that all those who run education in the city can do so for the sake of education. Each school should consider the issue of increasing tuition fees according to its own economic situation. It would be best not to increase tuition fees at all, and if an increase is necessary, it should be kept to the lowest possible extent. Everyone knows that after "August 13th," many private schools in Shanghai indeed had more money. Running a school is not like running a business where one must make money every day and accumulate wealth every year, and tuition fees should not be raised recklessly.

As for some schools that can maintain operations even without an increase, it is even more unreasonable to want to increase tuition fees. One must know that this is not the time to get rich, and it is especially inappropriate to want to get rich by running a school. In short, weigh the pros and cons, save on unnecessary expenses, and if an increase in fees is truly unavoidable, it should be kept within reasonable limits. This is, after all, an era of hardship! Otherwise, we will only lead Shanghai's education down the path of destruction!

Teacher: "Oh..."

### Strange Crow? Black Insect? - Originally Wild Ducks?

— Sheng

According to the local newspaper on the 14th, it was reported that at dawn on the 11th, tens of millions of birds resembling swans or geese flew over the city. However, according to someone who came from Hongkou yesterday, he said that on the morning of the 11th, he saw millions of black flying insects in Hongkou, forming a group like a black cloud, covering an area of more than twenty feet, flying over Hongkou, and their whereabouts are unknown. However, no one can know what these black insects are. According to a guest from Jinshan yesterday, it is enough to prove that what is called a black cloud is not a black insect, but a flock of wild ducks, and its damage to crops can be said to be shocking news for hundreds of years. I record it as follows:

According to a guest from Jinshan yesterday, he said: On the evening of the 10th, the villagers in a certain place were lying in bed when they suddenly heard a loud noise from the northwest, like a storm, surging and roaring, with the勢of overturning mountains and seas. The villagers thought that a strong wind had suddenly arrived, which was a sign that the weather was about to turn cold, so they did not think it was strange. When they opened the door to inspect in the morning, they were greatly shocked, because dozens of acres of rice had been completely lost. At that time, although the rice had been harvested, it was still in the field, and it was not known whether it had been stolen by someone or eaten by some kind of animal. However, if it had been stolen by someone, it would never have been so completely gone. Therefore, those who lost their rice all cried bitterly, while those who had not suffered losses were thankful that they had escaped.

Unexpectedly, that night, a strong wind rose again, and the villagers were greatly shocked. The villagers in the tens of miles around all got up holding poles and sticks, and saw that the fields were full of wild ducks, no less than tens of millions, creeping and moving. The villagers hit them with sticks, but they did not fly away, only making a grunting sound, slightly avoiding the villagers' blows. After a long time, one flew up, and then the group flew away, as if there was a leader. Afterwards, the villagers captured the ducks, some of whom had been injured, and some who had not been injured, no less than several hundred. The area damaged the next night was larger than what was eaten the night before, covering no less than a hundred acres. People in the city who saw them bought one and cooked it, and it was no different from the wild ducks bought on the market. The third night, the villagers waited with sticks, but they never came again.

Wild ducks harming rice fields is a rare event in thousands of years. However, according to people, these wild ducks mainly come from Taihu Lake, because there are always hunters who go to Taihu Lake to hunt ducks, especially in winter, to make a living. Since the outbreak of the war, hunters have not dared to go, and these wild ducks have been breeding very rapidly. Recently, due to overproduction, they have vigorously carried out their colonization policy, and thus harmed the crops.

However, I have several doubts: (1) Wild ducks in Taihu Lake have existed for a long time, and I have never heard of them affecting rice fields. Even in places like West Lake, there are also these things, and I have never heard of them damaging rice fields. Why is it that they cause such severe damage to rice fields? This is the first thing that is doubtful. (2) Wild ducks damaging rice is rarely heard of. Even if it happens, why don't they damage the rice in the nearby fields, but fly hundreds of miles away to harm the rice in Jinshan? This is the second thing that is doubtful. (3) Are wild ducks collective animals? Assuming one duck does not fly and is hit, would it rather die than leave? This is the third thing that is doubtful. This wild duck damaging rice is really an unprecedented strange event. I write this now to provide it to scientists for research.

### After the Rain Comes Sunshine

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 19 Watching Flowers and Appreciating the Moon Activities Lead to a Family, Planting Jade and Nurturing Pearls Conveys the Art of Pregnancy

Now let's talk about this honeymoon trip. Yu Danyun meant that it would be best to rest for a few days without taking any trips. Or, if there was an opportunity, she would simply take a leave next spring and travel abroad with her husband. It would be best if they could travel around the world in a week and see the new progress in the world. However, this expense would be relatively large, so it would be better for the two of them to start saving now, and if there was not enough, they could discuss it with Mrs. Su Liya. She had this idea, and fortunately, Lin Jiancheng obeyed Yu Danyun's every command. If she was happy to travel, he would naturally accompany her. If she was not happy to travel, he would not force her to go. However, the car manufacturing company run by Mrs. Su Liya had already manufactured several types of cars for family travel, which were to be tested during Yu Danyun's honeymoon trip. Previously, Mrs. Su Liya had originally wanted to specially make a family car and give it to the new couple as a gift, but Yu Danyun declined. She said, "They both have careers and each is busy with their own affairs. How could they have the time to travel? If it's just a honeymoon trip, it's just a one-time trip during the honeymoon. It would be a pity if that car was left unused after that." In order to thank Mrs. Su Langya for her kindness, she was willing to borrow one of the newly made family travel cars after the wedding to travel around and visit various places. There were three new styles of family travel cars. A few days ago, Mrs. Su Liya asked someone to drive them over and let Jin Danyun choose. Jin Huyun said, "Since we are testing the cars, let's test all three cars." These family travel cars were well-equipped. The cars had exquisite electric lights and were also equipped with wireless radios, so they could listen to news and music from various places. Inside, there was a folding mandarin duck bed, which could be separated or combined, making it perfect for newlyweds. With a twist of a switch, it could be folded up and immediately turned into a living room, and the mandarin duck bed would become a sofa chair. At the back of the car, there was a small kitchen equipped with an electric stove, so you could cook your own food as long as you had fish, meat, vegetables, and fruits ready. The small kitchen also had an electric refrigerator, so even in the summer, it was very convenient to eat some iced snow pears and drink some iced soda. Although it was a small kitchen, it could prepare food and drink for three or four passengers. In addition to the small kitchen, there was also a bathroom with water pipes that led to the roof of the car, where a water tank was installed. Because now there are tap water pipes everywhere in China, and there are water towers everywhere on the highways, it is very convenient to get water. Therefore, the bathroom was also equipped with a bathtub, which was made of leather and could be folded up when not in use, which was very ingenious.

### Odds and Ends of Christmas (Street Gleanings)

— Liu Lan

Night has fallen, and the lights are as bright as a painting. Dragging heavy steps, I shuffle through the streets, as slow as a wild beast trapped in a cage.

The bustling, crowded shop windows compete to tell me something, as if showing off their respective craftsmanship. But, if judged with a discerning eye, how vulgar and clumsy they are! Fat village women in heavy makeup. In fact, it's still that same old trick: "Christmas gifts."

The residents under this same blue sky are moving toward two extremes day by day: extravagant decadence is one world, and poverty, freezing, and starvation are another. Looking at the customers coming and going in the stores like a shuttle, you would never believe that on the same day, in different corners, more than thirty cases of rice robbery occurred.

Noble gentlemen and elegant ladies emerge from the doors of hotels; haggard, ragged vagrants stretch out dog-claw-like black hands. Contempt answers the plea. Disappearing into the night wind are satisfied belches and cries of hunger.

Kind-faced, white-haired old men and trees adorned with snowflakes are indispensable embellishments of Christmas. These are probably symbols of peace and happiness? At first glance, they make you feel a kind of joy involuntarily. Who doesn't love that beautiful and clean picture?

But, in this year when even the goddess of peace is crying, I rather doubt whether Santa Claus can still force a smile. Seeing this vast human tragedy, can the old man not cry in sorrow? Moreover, where is there such a tranquil garden? It is a bloody age!

Another seasonal gadget parades before me: greeting cards of different colors, different patterns, different forms, filling a window. They are used to wish friends happiness. The intention is naturally good, but unfortunately, it is too unfair. The cost of one card could sustain another group of people for several days! Moreover, happiness mostly slips away from the fingers of those holding the cards.

The shop windows continue to show off their charm, but I no longer have the mood to stroll.

### The Birth of Jesus and Society

(III) To Comfort the Sorrowful? Christmas is the expression of eternal joy. The songs of the angels are so jubilant, and the good news they convey is so joyful. These all symbolize world peace, the so-called era of Yao and Shun is about to arrive, that is, the so-called "Kingdom of Heaven is near." The people who are in poverty, sickness, and prison, hear this sound, and are all overjoyed, eagerly anticipating the coming of this great Jubilee year. Jesus said: "Do not be afraid," "Do not be sad," I give you peace, my own peace, so that your joy may be fulfilled, even forever." Therefore, every Christmas, Christians always rush about, and try their best to make the sorrowful get the joy of universal celebration. (IV) To Bring Light to the Darkness? All the people who dwell in the dark and dead land, will see the true light shining, leading them under the broad daylight. Jesus said, I come to the world, is the light of the world, those who follow me, will not dwell in darkness, and will surely obtain the light of life. Jesus opened the eyes of the blind, verifying that He is the light of life. Truth is light, conscience is the eye. When conscience is dim, truth is unclear, is the greatest darkness, the mind and personality, will certainly fall, creating a dark world, floating and murderous, treacherous deception, looting extortion, suppression, corruption, aggression, superstition, etc. are all the evil results produced by the darkness of the human heart. Just look at the results of the war? What gifts do the gods of war give to people? How can pen and ink describe it? It is rare for Jesus's true light to shine strongly, breaking the power of darkness, and seeing the true light of the Kingdom of Heaven again.

### Gleanings from the Opera Stage

— Junmei

At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the people in the Public Concession were addicted to opera, and Empress Dowager Cixi was even known as an opera fan. The inner court was filled with music and singing every day, and she also ordered skilled craftsmen to create various stage sets that matched the plot to adjust the monotony of the stage background. From then on, scene operas became popular in various theaters. According to research, scene operas already existed in the Ming Dynasty. For example, Zhang Dai's "Tao Guang'an Reminiscence" mentions the women's opera of Liu Huiji: "Liu Huiji had strange fantasies and wanted to make up for the shortcomings of the opera world. For example, when Emperor Ming of Tang traveled to the Moon Palace and Ye Fashan performed magic, the stage was suddenly dark and the ground was dark. When the hand rose and the sword fell, with a thunderous sound, the black curtain suddenly closed, revealing a moon, which was as round as a compass. The four sides were dyed with five-color clouds made of sheep horns, and in the middle sat Chang'e, with a cassia tree and Wu Gang pounding medicine, Inside the light gauze, several moonlights were lit, and the light was as green as a dawn, shooting out to form beams, thus stepping into the moon's cave, the scene was magical, forgetting that it was a play." It can be seen that the scene operas in the Ming Dynasty were already quite ingenious. Today's Shanghai-style local operas take novelty in scenery as their ability, and this should be regarded as the origin.

It is rare to find female performers with martial arts skills among Kun operas. This is limited by natural talent, and there is nothing that can be done about it. However, when Kun operas first flourished at the end of the Qing Dynasty, there were countless Yingying Wanyan performers among the male and female roles, competing for a seat with the men. Martial male roles such as Chen Changgeng of the Chen Family Troupe, who performed "Changban Slope," "Jiepai Pass," "Four Heroes Village," and "Luoma Lake," were extremely agile in their skills, whether they were wearing long armor or short clothing. They were famous wherever they went in Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangdong. There was also Yun Jinhong, who was able to perform many operas, and was skilled in tumbling and falling. Her voice was loud and pleasant to listen to. Not only was she rare in the Southern Troupe, but she could also be called outstanding among the martial male roles in the Northern Troupe. At the end of the Guangxu period, there was Zhou Fubao in the theaters of the capital, who was famous for performing the role of Sun Wukong. She could perform dozens of somersaults on a steel pole and could perform sixty or seventy spins in the middle of the stage without blushing or panting. At first, no one knew that she was a female. As for male roles, there were En Xiaofeng and Chen Huifeng, whose voices were high and melodious, and whose words were accurate and round. Whether singing or acting, they were both exemplary. Among the painted-face roles, there was Jin Chu, who was famous in the world for his black head. His voice was loud and clear, almost surpassing the seat of Xiu Shan. His thunderous singing in "Exploring the Yin Mountain" and "Entering the Palace Twice" also had unique merits. As for the clown roles, there was Xie Shaolan. Although he was not a true clown, his language was clumsy and straightforward, his appearance was hateful, and his posture often made people laugh. He was also able to attract attention for a while. As for today, apart from the female roles, there are few roles that do not have the sigh of lack of talent, let alone martial arts. Even Meng Xiaodong, who is famous in the opera world for her male role, is comparable to Shu Yan, and is as rare as a phoenix feather or unicorn horn!

When I was young, I watched puppet shows (that is, marionette shows) and felt that the ingenuity of the performers was beyond reach. When performing, the performers pulled the strings and sang behind the curtain, and the puppets on the stage moved and posed in harmony with the music. It was like being in a dance hall, with melodious singing and the sound of Sheng and reed instruments. In recent years, they have gradually become rare. Most of those who do this profession are down-and-out actors, so the operas they perform are all very realistic. When these people were on the red carpet, performing in makeup, how could they not attract attention for a while? When they become old and their beauty fades, they cannot avoid making a living by using puppets. It is also sad! At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Zhou Liangong wrote to He Juede: "When I was young, I saw puppet shows, which were about two feet long, with many threads, and were manipulated by people. Recently, they have been reduced to a few inches in size and pushed with wooden boards. They look like people who are using their own intelligence. Alas! The puppets are also getting smaller and smaller, and they are not controlled by human threads, but want to use their own intelligence. How terrible and sad!" Thinking about the past, I can't help but sigh!

### Random Chat About Christmas and the Performing Arts

— Xin Liang

Christmas is almost here again. In European and American countries, almost everyone, young and old, celebrates this holiday with great enthusiasm. Movie theaters, dance halls, nightclubs – all are packed. People shout, cheer, eat, and play, almost forgetting all the troubles and unhappiness they’ve encountered throughout the year.

Indeed, Christmas is inseparable from entertainment. Look, in fact, countless entertainers are going crazy for Christmas. They are all happy to decorate this carnival as grandly as the New Year.

The movies released in theaters for Christmas are mostly the best, either grand and magnificent or with intricate plots, or light and joyful. To accommodate the excessive number of viewers, they are prepared to add extra screenings at 11:00 AM or 11:00 PM. Some even specially select several precious, colorful short films to be shown before the main feature. In Hollywood, of course, the situation is even more lively. Gift-giving, sending Christmas cards, gathering for banquets…it truly is a case of "the city never sleeps," so lively that nothing can compare.

Next, the dance halls are quite lively. Almost every one is open all night, and they have specially prepared a variety of novel entertainment programs to be performed during Christmas. In addition, there are things like "Christmas menus," "Christmas white hat cakes"... everything takes on a new look because of Christmas. The interiors of the dance halls are decorated with colorful decorations, and the dancers have also prepared new outfits, permed their hair, and are ready to show off when Christmas arrives. Therefore, for Christmas in the dance halls, it is truly unknown how much money is spent.

The Shanghai performing arts scene will naturally be no exception. During Christmas, they will become even more active, making big preparations to rush business and make money. Whether it's theaters, dance halls, or broadcasting... everyone is scrambling to prepare special Christmas programs. These programs must be the best and most able to attract people's attention.

Christmas is a carnival. If we could carefully calculate the money spent that day, we would definitely find that the amount is astonishing!

"Save the nation without forgetting entertainment, entertain without forgetting saving the nation!" Although these two sentences are somewhat outdated, I think everyone needs to practice them earnestly at present. Entertainment, in some ways, is certainly very important, but in any case, at this time and place in Shanghai, every citizen should not waste too much money on so-called "celebration." When we are entertained, we should think of the brave soldiers fighting on the front lines and the displaced people wandering the streets without clothes or food, and therefore save some money to use as winter clothing allowances and do some good deeds. Then, celebrating Christmas in this way will feel even more meaningful.

### Microscopic Time-Lapse Photography – A Powerful Tool for Educational Films

— Yan Chengxi

Recently, the laboratory at New York University in the United States used microscopic time-lapse photography, placing a camera in front of a microscope to capture footage. The setup is very sophisticated, capable of rapidly displaying extremely slow movements, greatly assisting in the research of cancer and other terrifying diseases. For example, the process of a flower blooming, the state of plant growth, and the activity of pathogens can all be captured. Dr. Robert Chambers of the university and others have applied this technology to express the slow unfolding of microorganisms and human tissues in a short period of time, creating films. It enables the performance of microbial activity that is invisible to the naked eye and changes that usually take several days or weeks, in just a few minutes, making a great contribution to education. In recent years, our government has produced educational films. If we can research and improve and use this method, the benefit to education will be significant.

New Film Introduction

### Little Miss Broadway

— Qi Hua

We have seen too many movies depicting the stupidity, baseness, cruelty, and tyranny of indigenous people; and how white soldiers bravely defeated them is also always the same. The conclusion reached is: such stupid, cruel nations should perish! "Little Miss Broadway," however, is relatively moderate. It makes an indigenous chief willing to reconcile with white people and stop killing each other, but behind the screen, there is also a condition attached: the indigenous people tacitly acknowledge that they are vassals of the white people.

Because "Little Miss Broadway" stars Shirley Temple, the screenwriter even uses the friendship between Shirley and the young chief to inspire the indigenous people to "be brave enough to change" with childlike innocence. In fact, what is the difference between this and "Gunga Din"?

As for the director, the entire film unfolds in a straightforward manner. Besides fully depicting the stupidity and cruelty of the indigenous people, there is no achievement worth mentioning. Even the so-called "battle" scene where the indigenous people attack the mounted police lacks clarity in its weaving and cannot show a state of tension.

Of Shirley Temple's films, I feel that "Heidi" is the most satisfying, because this play allows her to fully display her acting skills. "Little Miss Broadway" doesn't have any special achievements, but it doesn't make people dislike it, like some of her past films. Shirley also has a shortcoming, which is that the position of her eyebrows and eyes is too close. When making a worried expression, her eyebrows and eyes squeeze together even more. In this way, her worry seems very "contrived," and the director happened to use two "close-up" shots here.

### Storm Over the Border

Performed in Yunnan

The Central Film Studio Troupe performed the four-act play "Storm Over the Border" in Yunnan on the seventh of this month. The actors included Bai Yang, Gu Er’yi, Wei Heling, and the director was Shen Xiling.

Gao Zhanfei also came to Kunming with the Central Film Studio’s location shooting crew, but did not participate in this performance. (Note: "Storm Over the Border" was written by Yang Hansheng, depicting the Mongolian and Han people eliminating private grievances and working together to resist foreign aggression under the banner of national liberation. It was serialized in the anti-Japanese drama published in Hankou and was widely circulated.)

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Several Amateur Opera Enthusiasts in the Banking Industry

(1) The person who could make Shu Yan afraid of him was originally a petty patrol officer in the Public Security Bureau. As the saying goes, "Not afraid of officials, only afraid of those in charge." This petty patrol officer, although only a small head among several policemen, just happened to be in charge of the Chunshu Hutong area. Since Shu Yan had an addiction, this patrol officer could use this to coerce him, sending Shu Yan a card today (for matters such as weddings, funerals, celebrations, and a child's first month), asking him to write a list of donors tomorrow, and even asking him for benefits during the New Year and festivals. He simply gave Shu Yan a headache, but fearing to offend him, he had no choice but to grit his teeth and endure it. The most ridiculous thing was that some wealthy merchants in Beiping held private performances at home and asked some respectable people to invite Shu Yan to join in the performance, but he could decline on the grounds of illness. Later, some mischievous people simply asked a certain patrol officer to speak to Shu Yan. Although Shu Yan could still decline in the same way, he always had to say a lot of nice things to this patrol officer, or else he had to send him a few coins in private to settle the matter. Therefore, this patrol officer had enjoyed quite a bit of benefit from Shu Yan for many years (the patrol officers and patrol officials in Beiping were usually not transferred for more than ten years). (2) The person who looked down on Shu Yan the most was not an outsider, but his younger brother, Yu Shengsun. This person has the nickname "Yu the Madman." The two brothers never visited each other (i.e., did not associate). He looked down on his older brother for a reason. Here, let me first describe Shengsun's history, and we can know that he also had his reasons for looking down on his older brother. Twenty years ago, Shengsun studied the Cheng style (Cheng Changgeng style) from Mr. Zhou Ziheng, a broker at the Tongrentang pharmacy. The owner of the pharmacy, Mr. Le, owned a large fortune and was a connoisseur of Peking opera. He often hosted famous actors from the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods and general dignitaries at his home, and the sounds of singing and dancing never ceased all night. (165) Miss Murong Wan'er, the female lead of "Master," is a talented student from a certain university who is known for performing the dance-drama "Regret of the Ming Dynasty" and is now a newcomer at Minhua Company.
