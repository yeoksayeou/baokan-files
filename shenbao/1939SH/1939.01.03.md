### After Wang Jingwei's Expulsion from the Party, the Central Propaganda Department Issues a Statement to the Outside World: Wang's Declaration Can Only Represent His Personal Intentions; the Established National Policy of Resistance Against Japan Will Not Be Relaxed Due to This; Internal Traitors Will Be Eliminated, and We Will Fight the Japanese to the End

(Chongqing) Today, the Central Propaganda Department and the Political Department issued (A) a statement to the outside world and (B) instructions to party departments at all levels and political training personnel in the armed forces regarding the matter of Zhao Ming's (Wang Jingwei's courtesy name) violation of discipline and harm to the party and the country. Key points are recorded separately as follows: Statement to the outside world: (1) Mr. Wang's decision to leave the country for recuperation was not communicated to comrades in the country beforehand, nor was a formal letter or telegram sent afterward. It is clear that this was a purely personal action and has no connection with the party, government, or military. His actions outside the country cannot be regarded as representing any aspect. Furthermore, the leader had already solemnly declared to China and foreign countries in the press. Recently, Mr. Wang suddenly published his so-called "suggestion to the central government" in Hong Kong newspapers. The central government has not yet received it, but it has already been widely publicized abroad. Given Mr. Wang's history in the party and the country, it is inappropriate both in terms of sentiment and reason to take such action. (2) Mr. Wang's declaration can only represent his personal intentions, or the cowardly and despicable mentality of a very small number of weak-willed people who willingly allow themselves to be used by the enemy and puppets. It will not have any impact on the overall prospect of the war of resistance, because Mr. Wang's personal opinion is not enough to shake the firm will of the entire military and civilian population to resist Japan. (3) As for the Sino-Japanese issue, it is not a matter of a day or two, let alone a matter for one or two individuals. The central government's decision to resist Japan is in accordance with the instructions of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will and is based on the unanimous demands of the people of the whole country. Therefore, resistance against Japan is our country's established national policy, which cannot be easily shaken or changed by the dissenting opinions of one or two individuals. Since the September 18th Incident, the entire country, from top to bottom, has endured humiliation and borne heavy burdens. Mr. Wang's pain and indignation towards the Japanese invaders is well known to the people of the country. From the Battle of Shanghai to the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, Mr. Wang personally experienced them. His advocacy of sincere unity and joint efforts to overcome national difficulties is still fresh in our minds. In terms of both theory and sentiment, how could there be such contradictory statements? (4) Mr. Wang's statement is probably a temporary deception by the enemy's cunning. Konoe's absurd declaration included "The trinity of Japan, Manchuria and China," "Stationing troops and free residence in the Chinese mainland," and "Joint anti-communism, including the stationing of troops in Inner Mongolia," none of which are not conspiracies to destroy China. Even a three-foot-tall child knows the dangerous poison of his schemes. Our leader has long since severely denounced them one by one, exposing them without reservation. Mr. Wang's self-contradictory propositions from Hong Kong are undoubtedly something that those close to him grieve over and those who hate him rejoice over. To take a step back, if Konoe's statement has even the lowest level of sincerity, it further proves that the Japanese invaders are exhausted and have reached the end of their rope. We should actively counterattack, recover lost territory, and complete the final victory. How can we seek compromise halfway at this time? (5) Facts prove that the Japanese invaders' recent smokescreen of seeking peace is entirely a probe before a new offensive. Konoe's statement can be described as a kind of manipulation for Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang is unwilling to trust the ultimate success of the entire military and civilian population's resistance against Japan, but instead trusts Konoe's deceptive conspiracy. Korea is a good example. May those who understand righteousness, like Mr. Wang, reconsider. Although Mr. Wang's decision to act may have its reasons for himself, in the past, Mr. Wang sometimes showed firmness and sometimes wavering in the revolutionary process. During the current period of new difficulties in the war of resistance, he may have experienced temporary wavering, thus leaving the revolution. Although this will not have any impact on the country's war of resistance, everyone who respects and loves Mr. Wang cannot help but feel deeply sorry. (6) However, it is found that at the time of success of revolutions in various countries, there often occur elements who attempt to compromise halfway and leave the revolution. This is an inevitable phenomenon in the revolutionary process. Not to mention the distant past, but in recent times, such as those who left the party and attached themselves to Yuan Shikai in the early years of the Republic, and Chen Jiongming's betrayal of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, are examples. However, this is still a personal action and not a division of the revolutionary camp. In fact, the revolutionary forces will inevitably become more united and stronger as a result, and their development and success will be more assured. Today, with our great enemy in front of us, we must be of one heart and one mind to obey the supreme leader, resolutely resist Japan to the end, and never relax because of the enemy's instigation.

(B) Internal instructions: (1) Resistance against Japan is the established national policy of our party and will not be easily changed due to the dissenting opinions of one or two comrades. The central government's decision to resist Japan is not a matter of a day or two, nor is it a matter for one or two individuals. There is a basis for this in the historical documents of our party. (1) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and will have long foreseen that the completion of the National Revolution cannot be achieved without resistance against Japan to achieve national independence, freedom, and equality. (2) The declarations and resolutions of previous congresses of our party have all stated that when the nation is in danger of extinction and peace is at the last moment, the entire nation must resolutely rise up to resist foreign aggression and must not compromise halfway and hasten its own demise. (2) Mr. Wang's sudden declaration on December 29 last year is an act of betrayal against the party and the country. First, Mr. Wang, as vice president, has violated party discipline and violated the party's declaration and resolutions. How can he face Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven and the millions of soldiers and civilians who died in the war of resistance? Second, since the September 18th Incident, Mr. Wang has strongly advocated sincere unity and joint efforts to overcome national difficulties. After the Lugouqiao Incident, he resolutely advocated long-term resistance against Japan. At the Provisional National Congress, he enthusiastically supported the outline of resistance against Japan and national reconstruction. He has never had different opinions on the war of resistance. Now, at the most critical moment of the war of resistance, he suddenly issued such a contradictory declaration, which makes us feel sorry for Mr. Wang personally. (3) The content of Mr. Wang's declaration clearly shows that he has yielded to Japanese imperialism and recognized its conditions for the destruction of China. The so-called "joint anti-communism" (including the stationing of troops in Inner Mongolia), the so-called "free residence," and the so-called "economic cooperation" are all accepted one by one. Subjectively, Mr. Wang may not be willing to please Japan and echo the traitors, but objectively, he is surrendering to the enemy and selling out the motherland. In the history of our revolution, it will be the greatest stain forever. However, we still hope that Mr. Wang will repent and return to the ranks of the war of resistance, which will still be gratifying for the nation and the country. Otherwise, Mr. Wang's personal political life will be completely ruined from now on. (4) However, Mr. Wang's departure from the revolution will objectively make us more united and determined in the war of resistance. Therefore, Mr. Wang's actions will have no impact on the party and the country. Apart from adding another tool for the enemy and puppets to swindle and deceive, it will not have any effect. Only Mr. Wang's personal loss, that is, destroying his revolutionary history and betraying the people of the whole country and all party comrades, is the most regrettable. Although, according to the revolutionary history of various countries, there are always vacillating elements who attempt to compromise halfway and leave the revolution. This is an inevitable process in the revolutionary process, such as the Yuan Shikai's attempt to usurp power by forming a cabinet during the Wuchang Uprising, and Chen Jiongming's rebellion later, are all examples of the dust that is discarded in the advancement of the revolutionary train. However, these are all personal actions and not a division of the revolutionary camp. Therefore, we must, in a positive way, strengthen the unity of revolutionary forces, and in a negative way, not do things that make those close to us grieve and those who hate us rejoice, so as to promote the success of the revolution. Mr. Wang's decisive declaration must be felt with infinite pain by all of us who are loyal to the party and love the country. But we (with a sword against our chest, not looking aside,) must now step up the second phase of the war of resistance, eliminate internal traitors, and resolutely fight the enemy to the end. The final victory can be expected. (A telegram from the 1st)

(Chongqing) Yesterday, at the joint meeting of the Central Executive Committee and the Supervisory Committee, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated being lenient towards Wang, proposing to first give friendly advice, then give a warning, and finally expel him from the party if he is stubborn. However, according to Reuters reporters who learned from reliable sources, Kuomintang leaders were extremely indignant at Wang's peace telegram and unanimously passed a resolution to permanently expel him from the party. It is said that Wu Zhihui and Zhang Ji, two elders who had worked with Wang for ten years, were also extremely angry. It is reported that Wang's telegram was sent on December 29 and was distributed to various newspapers in Hong Kong by Lin Baisheng on the 1st. It arrived in Chongqing yesterday morning. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek immediately convened a joint meeting of the Central Executive Committee and the Supervisory Committee, attending in person, without resting on New Year's Day. The National Government also issued an order that anyone participating in a regime organized by the Japanese would be arrested and prosecuted for the crime of endangering the Republic of China. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)

(Chongqing) Zhou Enlai, a leader of the Chinese Communist Party, told Reuters reporters today that Wang Jingwei's peace movement was nothing new to him, because he had been with Wang for twenty years and knew that he was a coward. Wang often changed his direction in his political career. He cooperated with the Communist Party in Wuhan in 1927. He participated in Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang's anti-Chiang rebellion and joined Hu Hanmin's Guangzhou mutiny. However, he always betrayed his friends when the situation was difficult. Wang is a speculator, so he has always adopted a policy of minimum resistance. The first movement to negotiate peace with Japan appeared after the fall of Guangzhou in October last year and before the fall of Hankou. In a conversation with Reuters reporters, he expressed his preparation for China to negotiate peace with Japan. All senior military officers who participated in the Southern Hunan Military Conference in November condemned the absurdity of his remarks. Zhang Fakui, who is currently commanding the battle in Guangdong Province and is a long-time friend of Wang, also attacked Wang severely. At the National Political Participation Council held in Chongqing in November, a confidant of Wang also made the absurd statement that British, American, French and Soviet assistance cannot be relied upon, and China must seek a peaceful solution to the Sino-Japanese conflict with the help of Germany and Italy. Wang has been in contact with the Japanese through his confidants in Hong Kong. At least two of his confidants have traveled to Tokyo. In fact, Wang's actions cannot undermine China's internal unity, nor can they harm China's strength in resisting Japan. Except for a few insignificant people such as Zeng Zhongming and Chu Minyi, there are currently few people in the party, the government, or the military who support Wang. It is still doubtful whether Gu Mengyu or Chen Gongbo are as corrupt as Wang. As for the rumor that Wang's trip to Hong Kong had been approved by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in advance, it is absolutely untrue. He knew and firmly believed that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had nothing to do with Wang's actions. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)

(Hong Kong) Wang plans to go to Nanjing to convene a fake Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, using the name to negotiate peace with Japan and confront the Central Government's Fifth Plenary Session. He is currently secretly negotiating with Doihara in Hong Kong. Wachi has been sent back to Shanghai to prepare everything. (Special telegram from 8 p.m. on the 2nd)

(Hong Kong) Wang originally planned to convene a fake plenary session in Hong Kong and had a conversation with Zhang Fakui's representative, but was rejected. Wang then secretly left Hong Kong on the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso and arrived in Shanghai on the 31st. Various women's organizations telegraphed Lin and Chiang, supporting the war of resistance and denouncing Wang. (Special telegram from the 2nd)

(Hong Kong) According to yesterday's Chinese evening newspaper, Wang Jingwei will indeed go to Shanghai. "Wen Zongyao, President of the Legislative Yuan of the Reformed Government," telegraphed Wang two days ago, inviting him to go north. Therefore, it is generally speculated that Wang may collude with the "Reformed Government." (Express News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)

### Japanese Troops in Guangdong Province Are Still Coiled Up, Stubbornly Defending; Building Fortifications in Guangzhou, Huangpu and Other Places to Defend Against Chinese Army Attacks; Bai Chongxi Inspects Defense Areas and Promotes Political Work

Guilin Director Bai Chongxi of the Southwest Military Headquarters recently returned here after inspecting the defense areas. In order to understand the latest developments in the war situation in South China, the reporter paid a special visit this morning and inquired about the situation. He was told that although the Japanese troops in central Guangdong have been slightly active recently, except for Sanshui, where troops have been increased to the strength of one division, other areas are still coiled up and stubbornly defending. Guangzhou City is doing its best to consolidate, so heavy troops are deployed in Shunde, Huangpu, Zengcheng, Foshan, Sanshui, and Jiujiang, actively building fortifications to protect Guangzhou City and defend against Chinese attacks. The strength of the Japanese army in southwestern Guangdong Province has not increased, and they are still entrenched, waiting for reinforcements. Looking at the battles on various fronts, they seem to be silent on the surface, but this silence is by no means stagnation. Since the Chinese army's counterattack on Guangzhou, the Japanese have suffered heavy losses. The strength of the Japanese has been defeated by the Chinese and they are unable to commit crimes. At present, it seems that they are trying to replenish their forces, so there is no major battle. However, the Japanese are still actively plotting in southwestern Guangdong Province. The Chinese side has insight into the various conspiracies of the Japanese army, and all routes are deployed and ready to wait in strict array. The Japanese army intends to peep into Nanning from Beihai and cut off the Chinese army's important traffic lines, but the traffic in that area has been thoroughly blocked by the Chinese army, and guerrillas are swarming up at the same time. At the same time, the mountains are steep, and the terrain is favorable to China. If the Japanese army comes to commit crimes, it will be wiped out. Although the Japanese army's attack on Wuzhou from Xijiang has been severely attacked, the attempt to commit crimes has not been interrupted. I dare to expect that if the Japanese army comes again, the difficulties it encounters will be ten times more difficult than before. Bai continued that the second phase of the all-out war of resistance has already begun. In order to effectively advance toward the strategy of all-out attack on the Japanese, I have been actively trying to promote politics over military affairs and the people over the soldiers. In particular, this decision to go to the front line for inspection, I feel that the political power is very important. In Guangxi, it is planned to formulate a national public regulation, which is being drafted. Once passed, the people of the entire province will be automatically sworn to abide by it. The content is roughly as follows: In terms of combat, it is determined not to be a traitor, not to be a compliant citizen, not to be a Japanese spy, not to participate in a puppet organization, not to build roads for the Japanese, and not to lead the way for the Japanese. In terms of economy, it is determined not to purchase Japanese goods, not to buy Japanese raw materials, not to use Japanese currency, and not to cooperate with the Japanese economy. If this plan is implemented in Guilin, I plan to recommend it to the Central Government. I believe that this will definitely have great power in the all-out war of resistance strategy. (Telegram from the 2nd)

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese military information, the Chinese army in Dongjiang, Guangdong Province, did indeed completely recapture Zengcheng on the 31st of last month. Shilong is still under siege by the Chinese army, but the main force of the Japanese army has retreated to Shitan, and the Japanese army in Dongguan seems to be retreating to Humen. (Express News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)

(Hong Kong) According to news from foreigners in Guangzhou received here, Chinese guerrillas once broke into Dongshan on New Year's Eve and had a fierce battle with the Japanese army for two hours. The gunfire was very dense, and the number of Japanese casualties is unknown. (Express News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)

Guilin The Japanese army has repeatedly committed crimes in Xijiang, and has been miserably defeated. It has recently been heard that another division will be transferred to attack Yangjiang and land in the west. The Chinese army has long detected the Japanese army's conspiracy, and has made proper arrangements. At that time, it will definitely give a heavy blow. (Telegram from 4 p.m. on the 1st)

Guilin The Japanese army in Sanshui and Zengcheng has recently increased slightly, maintaining its original position and continuing to rush to build fortifications. There is no intention to commit crimes. However, the advanced troops of the Chinese army are very active, attacking from time to time, and giving them heavy blows. The Japanese army is very panicked. There are more than 500 soldiers of the Japanese army's Ikuta Unit in Jiujiang, more than 100 soldiers of the Japanese army's Nakamura Unit in Heqing, and more than 300 soldiers of the Japanese army's Toyokoro Unit in Shunde. (Telegram from the 1st)

Qujiang One regiment of the Japanese army in Zengcheng is stationed in Shetuling, Pengfang, Tingzigang, Geshui, and Longjiang. On the evening of the 26th, China attacked the Japanese army north of Zengcheng, and fought fiercely for three hours, killing twenty or thirty Japanese soldiers. In the area of Huaxian, Guangzhou, the Chinese army entered the Yalong River near Tanbu, and is advancing. (Telegram from the 1st)

Sihui At 10 a.m. this morning, more than 200 Japanese troops, with two artillery pieces, advanced to Yangmei from the southwest and attacked north. The Chinese army ambushed along the way, and was surrounded by the Chinese army in Shatou at 2 p.m. They are still in stalemate. (Telegram from the 1st)

### Li Hanhun Arrives in Guangdong to Take Office; Takes Office Before 2,000 People on New Year's Day; Then Holds a Solemn Military Parade

Lianxian Li Hanhun, the new chairman of Guangdong, arrived in Shu on the afternoon of the 31st, and was warmly welcomed by all walks of life. That night, Chairman Wu hosted a banquet to welcome Li, and the two chairmen talked for two hours. In addition to orally describing the provincial political situation, Wu also handed Li a memorandum, which recorded in detail the recent provincial political facilities. Li attached great importance to the memorandum. On New Year's Day morning, the two chairmen handed over the seal in front of 2,000 people, and held a military parade. The new secretary-general Hu Mingkun, finance minister Gu Yiqun, education minister Xu Chongqing, and provincial committee members Zhu Hui and He Tongjun also attended the ceremony. After the event, a grand meeting was held to welcome Chairman Wu and Chairman Li. Wu said in his speech that he originally intended to do his best for his hometown when he returned to Guangdong, but he did not expect that things would not go as he wished, and he expressed his deep apology to his hometown. He also praised Li for his talents and war achievements, and hoped that the people of the province would unite to support him, drive out foreign aggression and feudal remnants, and build a new Guangdong. In his reply, Li expressed his deep admiration for Wu's patience and hard work over the years, saying that if there were no external and internal obstacles, he believed that Wu's facilities would definitely benefit his hometown. He himself would work hard to realize Wu's unfinished business with the spirit of sword and shoes, etc. The whole audience was deeply moved and excited by Wu Li's speech. The simple and solemn grand meeting ended in shouts of "Down with Japanese imperialism." Wu bid farewell to Li and the audience one by one. Wu and Secretary-General Ouyang Ju drove off to Chongqing.

Editorial

### Denounce Wang Jingwei!

Konoe's absurd speech last month was originally a trial of inducing peace. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek severely refuted it, Japan's ghostly tricks have failed. Unexpectedly, Wang, who held an important position in the central government, dared to openly advocate begging Japan for surrender after abandoning his post and fleeing. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek pointed out that "Anti-Communism is a synonym for the destruction of China," but Wang insisted on "Anti-Communism"; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek pointed out that "The so-called no territorial demands actually encompasses China," but Wang said that this was the basis for "Sino-Japanese peace talks"; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also clearly pointed out that "The purpose of the economic group fallacy is to enslave China," but Wang said that this was "a principle that can be agreed upon." Looking at his absurd theory as a whole, there is nothing that does not violate the national policy proclaimed by the supreme leader, and there is nothing that does not distort Japan's intention to destroy China. Recognizing a thief as a father and losing his mind, he can be said to have reached the extreme! Fortunately, after Wang's ravings were published, they immediately aroused unanimous condemnation from all over the country, and they all advocated denunciation, which shows that the Chinese people's determination to resist Japan to the end is as firm as steel, and there is no room for any compromise elements. This is another very inspiring thing.

After reading Wang's blatant "colluding with the enemy to seek surrender" ravings, we can't help but think of his past remarks that hurt the war of resistance, which shows that he has been deliberately betraying the country for a long time. To give a few examples: After the Changsha fire, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Central Propaganda Department issued a declaration stating that this was an accident caused by the local authorities' panic when the incident occurred, but Wang took this opportunity to rant and hurt the national policy of scorched earth resistance. Secondly, China's war of resistance is a protracted war, and guerrilla warfare obviously occupies an important position in the process of protracted war. This has been repeatedly proclaimed by military leaders, and everyone in China knows it. However, Wang has repeatedly injured him, and even absurdly said that the guerrillas "roam around," which is equivalent to a roaming bandit in the late Ming Dynasty. In addition, regarding the diplomatic issue, the supreme leader has repeatedly pointed out that "We should recognize the principle of friends and enemies," but Wang has tried his best to advocate finding friends from among the countries that help Japan. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, Wang has used his lofty position to repeatedly publish such remarks that distort facts and hurt the war of resistance, knowing that he has no understanding of China's national policy of resisting Japan, and has no confidence in the future victory of China's resistance against Japan. Theory and action are consistent, and means and ends are inseparable. A theory that is always distorted will never have correct actions; opposing correct means must be against the goal. This has been proven again on Wang today.

Wang's traitorous face has been clearly revealed to the people of the country, and the Central Party Department has also announced his crimes and resolved to expel him from the party. This is indeed a gratifying phenomenon, because it not only shows the progress of the Chinese Kuomintang in the war of resistance, but also shows the upward development of Chinese politics. We have already said that Wang is a bare stick without the masses. His abandonment of his post and escape not only cannot affect China's war of resistance in the slightest, but also clarifies the mechanism of China's war of resistance. It will not (like the aggressors and traitors advertised) promote internal division in China, but will make the national united front more consolidated. In China today, which is determined to resist Japan, there should be no vacillating compromise elements in the governance mechanism. Removing a vacillating compromise element is equivalent to removing a mass of toxic residue, which increases the strength of the war of resistance by one point.

However, although Wang has fled, his crimes must be punished by national law, and he cannot be tolerated even more because he holds the position of Vice President of the Kuomintang and other important positions in the central government. We feel that merely expelling him from the party is not enough, so we hope that the National Government will also immediately issue an order to arrest him and punish him according to law.

We also know that Wang's traitorous actions are not just his own actions, and there must be many accomplices lurking in government agencies, carrying out conspiracies that are detrimental to the war of resistance. We hope that the National Government will also strictly report them and punish them! The National Government has yesterday clearly ordered to reiterate the "Regulations on Punishment of Traitors." The decree has stipulated that "Those who dare to commit treason and risk the world's great injustice" should also be strictly arrested and punished.

As the new year approaches, China's war of resistance is developing in an increasingly favorable direction. The exposure of Wang Jingwei's betrayal has made the war of resistance front more distinct, the political mechanism of China's war of resistance is becoming clearer, and the future of China's war of resistance is becoming more and more brilliant!

Yulin: Nearly 1,000 Japanese troops recently reinforced Wenxi and launched an eastern offensive at the end of last month, but were met with a head-on assault by Chinese troops, resulting in 600-700 Japanese soldiers killed. The remaining Japanese troops retreated westward in disarray. Chinese troops are now advancing victoriously. More than 4,000 Japanese troops from Hejin, Jishan, Xiangling, and west of Linfen also launched offensives in multiple directions toward Daning and Puxian at the end of last month, but were intercepted south of Yangning by Chinese troops and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. Japanese troops stationed in the northern part of Shanxi have been in arrears of military pay for three months, and canned food rations have been reduced by half, indicating a gradual trend towards collapse. (1st Dispatch)

### Chinese Troops on the Nanxun Line Continuously Capture Important Strongholds; Three-Pronged Assault Before Dawn on New Year's Day; Golden Hill, Green Hill, and Others Recaptured One After Another

Zhanggongdu: In the Nanxun battle, apart from minor skirmishes between Chinese guerrillas and the Japanese on the northern bank of the Xiu River in the past month, there had been no fierce fighting on the main front. Since the morning of the 28th, Japanese troops launched an unsuccessful attack on the northern bank of Zhanggongdu. In the afternoon, the battle situation turned calm again. The Chinese side had long intended to break this stalemate and launch a fierce attack on the Japanese. Taking advantage of the Japanese unpreparedness before dawn on New Year's Day, they suddenly launched a fierce three-pronged assault on key Japanese strongholds between Yongxiu and De'an. One route first launched a strong attack on Japanese troops in Golden Hill and Hejiashan north of Yongxiu. After about two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese were overwhelmed and retreated in disarray. Chinese troops occupied the area before noon and continued to capture Songzhuang, Hushan, and other places. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. It is estimated that over 10 Japanese rifles and other military supplies and documents were captured. Another route was also dispatched at the same time, capturing Green Hill, Gulaoling, and other places, killing over 100 Japanese soldiers, and capturing over 10 rifles and 3 machine guns. Another route also made considerable progress, recapturing Outangshi, Pushan, Xiawang, and other places around 2:00 PM, and continued to flank the Japanese troops in Qiujin. The Japanese troops, caught unprepared by the sudden strong Chinese assault, collapsed in disarray. Chinese troops drove straight in and are currently pursuing the Japanese rear fiercely. Fierce fighting continues between Chinese and Japanese troops in the area north of Baicha.

### Completing Our Sacred Mission

— Sun Ke

Time flies, and now it's the beginning of the 28th year of the Republic of China! What everyone remembers is, of course, the sacred War of Resistance that has lasted for one year and six months; what everyone pursues is, of course, a bright and splendid future. We cannot consider everything in the past to be satisfactory, but at least we can say this: the War of Resistance is always satisfactory. The War of Resistance is for the independence of the country, the liberation of the nation, and the freedom and equality of 450 million descendants of the Yellow Emperor. The important value of the War of Resistance itself will, of course, make anyone sing its praises. Moreover, the War of Resistance is the revolution. Just as we cannot doubt the revolution, we cannot doubt the War of Resistance; they have the same meaning.

However, engaging in the War of Resistance is not for the sake of the War of Resistance itself. The War of Resistance is merely a means, not an end. Our goal is to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Because the new China based on the Three Principles of the People is international equality (Nationalism), political equality (Democracy), and economic equality (People's Livelihood). The War of Resistance is to defeat the aggressive forces of Japanese imperialism and further seek the complete realization of Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood. Therefore, what everyone pursues is a bright and splendid future for a new China where "the War of Resistance will surely be won, and the nation will surely be built!"

How can we realize this future? This is the task for all of us!

Now that the goal is placed before us, and the responsibility is placed on the shoulders of each of us, everyone should pay attention to the following matters in the future:

First, we must have a strong belief in national self-esteem and self-confidence. We do not deny that the Chinese nation has some weaknesses and has exposed many moral failings, but the long history and culture of more than 5,000 years is something that no other country can catch up with. The Chinese people's love of peace, emphasis on trustworthiness, and hardworking and thrifty customs are also superior to those of any other nation. The Chinese people are not more foolish than Westerners. The Chinese people's innate intelligence and talent are indeed superior. However, due to the lack of popular education and the fact that politics, economics, and society have not yet reached the level of modernization, many shortcomings are still evident. This is also the reason why China is being invaded and oppressed by powerful enemies. However, invasion and oppression can be regarded as the only opportunity to awaken us, teach us, and improve us! We must never shake our strong belief in national self-esteem and self-confidence! If we fundamentally shake our belief in our own country and nation, then we can only declare spiritual bankruptcy, declare surrender, and willingly disgrace ourselves and become prisoners of imperialism and slaves of the Japanese! Those who have lost confidence are, in national terms, the dregs that should be eliminated; in individual terms, they are the biggest fools in the world.

Second, we must have a thorough understanding of the current military and political situation and an optimistic attitude. Why are some people pessimistic about the current situation? Why do they doubt the future of the War of Resistance? Why do they even hope for compromise and peace? This is undoubtedly due to their unclear assessment and observation of the future of military affairs, politics, and diplomacy. Of course, we do not deny that the loss of territory and troops over the past year or so is a failure rather than a victory. However, we must know that for a weak and backward nation to resist imperialism, this failure is inevitable. If we did not have the established situation of failure first, Japanese imperialists would not have come to invade us in the first place! Therefore, since the beginning of the War of Resistance, what we are fighting for is the final victory, not the gain or loss of a single place or city, or the advantages and disadvantages of a quick battle and quick decision. How can we strive for the final victory? Chairman Chiang has made it clear that what we are fighting for is a "protracted war," a "total war," and an "active war." Now is the time when the total war is unfolding, and the protracted war and the active war are beginning. What we are fighting for is how to consume the enemy and how to exhaust the enemy in the current stage. Only after a certain period of time can we use a major counteroffensive to determine the final victory. Therefore, in terms of the current stage of strategy, there is no need to be pessimistic at all. At the same time, is it only optimistic? Militarily, everything is entering a favorable situation? Politically, it is much more advanced and improved than before the war. In terms of finance, in addition to striving for production to balance exchange rates, we have recently received support from British and American loans. Diplomatically, the positive turnaround in the international situation is even more obvious. Looking at the enemy again: the increase in anti-war sentiment among their general population; the replenishment of their troops has encountered fundamental problems; their finances are even more exhausted and on the verge of collapse; as for their diplomatic isolation and helplessness, they will soon suffer a major blow, and their difficulties need no further discussion. Therefore, we are optimistic from any point of view! We certainly feel strained in many areas, but in fact, the enemy is even more strained than we are. Why do we only value the enemy and belittle ourselves! Everyone should completely overcome and eliminate all wavering ideas and pessimistic emotions!

Third, we must have the spirit of enduring hardship and fighting with perseverance. As mentioned earlier, what we are striving for is the "final victory," so everyone should know that "the more final," the more difficulties and sufferings we will experience. War is originally "something that cannot be avoided." What mankind seeks is peace, not war. The reason why we have no choice but to embark on the path of the War of Resistance is to seek survival for the nation and fight for independence for the country without looking back. In this sense, as long as it is beneficial to the nation and the country, and as long as the sacrifices and costs we pay are sufficient to benefit the survival of the nation and the independence of the country, we can only endure any hardship and suffering with all our might! Therefore, we hope that all compatriots and comrades across the country, whether at the front or in the rear, whether contributing money or effort, must grit their teeth and endure hardship to the end. At the same time, we must fight with the spirit of "seeking life in death" in a struggle where there is an enemy but no me. Now, some people are confined to a corner of the Southwest, thinking about the fall of their hometowns and the loss of their property, and feeling the pressure of life and the difficulty of their situation. As a result, they develop the idea of compromise and surrender from their usual pampered state. This is the most shameful phenomenon! In fact, judging from many current facts, it seems that apart from the soldiers at the front, what hardships have the people in the rear suffered? We only see abnormal prosperity and only see meaningless waste. How can it compare to the strict controls of countries during the European war! How can it compare to the frugality of the people during the European war! The current situation in China is indeed pathological and indeed needs to be corrected. However, on the other hand, it also shows that China has vast land and abundant resources, and its economic resilience is far beyond the reach of Japanese imperialism. As long as everyone can endure hardship, as long as everyone understands the true meaning of life, can adjust their personal living standards and desires, and at the same time contribute their strength and wealth to the country as much as possible, then, not to mention fighting the enemy for three to five years, even ten or eight years, or even a hundred years of war, China has the strength to sustain it! The problem is whether we can endure hardship and are willing to fight.

Fourth, we must use the Outline for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction as the only goal of our arduous struggle. A protracted war of resistance is originally an extremely difficult and arduous task, and what makes it difficult and arduous is not the War of Resistance itself, but the simultaneous advancement of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. The Provisional National Congress of our party once stated this very clearly: "We should exert our best efforts to strive for the survival and independence of the country and the nation, and at the same time, based on the Three Principles of the People, continue to complete political and economic construction so that China can gain freedom and equality in the world. We also know that if China can have a peaceful environment at present, it will be easier to complete such construction. However, the invasion of Japanese imperialism is deepening, making peace hopeless. This War of Resistance is bound to happen and is unavoidable. We cannot hope to build in peace, but should carry out the War of Resistance and construction at the same time. Therefore, the responsibility for saving the country and the nation simultaneously falls on our shoulders." As for how to carry out the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, the Three Principles of the People are our highest guiding principles, and the Outline for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction is our guiding principle. What we need to examine now is whether these construction outlines have been implemented, or how much of them have been implemented. What we need to strive for is how to develop wartime national construction work into a political and economic foundation for national revival after the war stops. For example, wartime state-owned trade and industrial and mining adjustments can achieve the goal of developing national capital and regulating private capital after the war; wartime political participation and military service systems can achieve the goals of democracy, local autonomy, and free conscription after the war. ... In short, in this process of fighting on the one hand and building the country on the other, we must not leave our outline at any time, and we must strive to realize the Three Principles of the People at all times.

Based on the above points, first, we firmly establish self-esteem and self-confidence in our own nation, and thus we have "something to rely on"! Second, we thoroughly understand the situation of the enemy and ourselves, and we are at ease, and thus we are "unshakable"! Third, we embrace the determination to sacrifice and fight to the end and engage in a protracted war with the enemy, and thus "the final victory" belongs to us! Fourth, we work hard based on a specific direction and goal, and thus we will not "collapse internally" during the war, and we can "revive" after the war! - This is our bright and splendid future! Everyone must catch up and complete our sacred mission!

### US Congress Reconvening Today, Roosevelt to Propose Important Bills to Strengthen Americas Defense and Amend Neutrality Act, Isolationists Still Plan to Obstruct but Influence is Diminished

(Washington) The US Congress is scheduled to convene this month for a profound discussion on foreign policy, the significance of which is unprecedented since the European War. According to preliminary observations, members of Congress will spend several months reviewing foreign policy and various issues, some of which relate to the situation in Europe and other dictatorships. President Roosevelt's proposals to increase national defense may be the most important bills that the new Senate and House of Representatives will discuss. The President has not yet announced his detailed plan, but the administrative departments have indicated that the President's program advocates a large increase in military strength, with emphasis on the Air Force. Recently, Secretary of War Johnson declared that the US Army Air Corps must double its strength, and perhaps even triple or quadruple it. Johnson also informally stated that the United States should have 7,000 to 10,000 military aircraft within four years. It is understood that the United States spent more than 10 billion US dollars on national defense last year. It is widely rumored that the total amount of this expenditure may increase to 15 billion US dollars in the fiscal year beginning July 1 this year. Some quarters in Washington have already declared that this expenditure is difficult to raise. Unless the White House and the various departments of national defense explain the reasons and purposes of the military build-up in detail, it will not be tolerated by the public. Various peace groups have also quickly informed several senators and representatives of their opposition to the President's large increase in armaments. The President's defense system is not only limited to the nation, but also a kind of continentalism, the purpose of which is to prevent any foreign country from gaining a foothold on the American continent. Some members of Congress certainly want to know the details of this move, how much it will cost, what achievements it will have in the future, and whether the Latin American countries fully understand and appreciate the US goals. As for the Neutrality Act, if the government proposes an amendment to allow the President to implement an arms embargo on one side of the belligerents, without having to implement this order on both sides of the belligerents or on all parties participating in the war, it can avoid countless legislative difficulties. The State Department does not admit that such a proposal is currently under consideration, but the claim that the government intends to make some amendments to the Neutrality Act is now rife, so this claim may not be without cause. Germany's anti-Jewish program and the influx of German Jews into the United States have raised the issue of whether immigration quotas should be revised. Some members of Congress advocate relaxing the German immigration quota so that more Jewish refugees can enter the country, but American labor groups and others strongly oppose this. Their intention is to ban immigration until the unemployment situation improves, so as to avoid robbing jobs. Several congressional leaders have expressed the view that any effort to change immigration quotas will be firmly opposed by both houses. The resolutions passed at the recent Pan-American Conference in the secret capital must be approved by the Senate, so the issue of the entire relationship between the United States and Latin America will also be discussed by Congress. Congress may ask government leaders to explain their interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine, which has been in place for a century. According to this doctrine, Europe is not allowed to continue its colonial attempts on the American continent. Germany's economic and other activities in Latin America also seem to be a matter for Congress to discuss. The Panama Canal is a very important chain for American defense. Secretary of War Woodring recently advocated immediately strengthening the defense of the canal and making it indestructible. This move requires the appropriation of huge sums of money, and some advocate opening a secondary canal to strengthen defense. Others advocate that the United States should separate the Pacific Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet. All of this requires huge expenses and must be approved by Congress. Congress will also discuss the recently added Atlantic squadron, and whether the United States should weaken the Pacific Fleet and permanently establish this squadron, or continue to strengthen it. The reciprocal trade agreement recently concluded between the United Kingdom and the United States will be subject to a fierce debate in Congress, as there are many who support it, but there are also those who criticize it.

Since the war, the total amount of income tax revenue in 1920 has exceeded 3,000,000,000 gold yuan. (February 1 AP)

(Washington) Secretary of Labor Perkins recently issued a New Year's message to workers across the country, explaining American industrial activity, stating that the amount of industrial and mining production has increased by 30% compared to a year ago, thereby reducing the number of unemployed and increasing the amount of wages paid. In the past five months, private industry has hired one million more workers, of which the manufacturing industry has been most positively affected. It is estimated that after the implementation of the low-cost housing construction plan, 800,000 construction workers and 1 million material handling workers can have jobs this year.

### The French Budget is Passed by Congress, Three Rounds of Discussion Between the Senate and the House of Representatives

(Paris) The French budget must be passed before the end of the year in accordance with the law, so the clocks of the Senate and the House of Representatives stopped for 24 hours to extend the life of the 1938 Congress. The Senate finally passed the budget with 281 votes against 16 votes. The case was discussed three times between the Senate and the House of Representatives, stipulating an expenditure of 66,364,000,000 francs and a surplus of 23,500,000 francs. The House of Representatives made some modifications and passed the budget with 367 votes against 288 votes, and immediately sent it to the Senate, where it was finally approved by the Senate. It took less than 19 days from the proposal to the passage of this case, which is a new record for the rapid passage of the French budget in both houses. (February 2 Reuters)

### Germany Urgently Needs to Promote Foreign Trade, Deeply Afraid that South America Will Follow the UK and the US in Resisting Goods, Domestic Consumer Goods Workers are Lacking

(Berlin) The characteristics of the German economy as of the end of 1938 are that although the public retains purchasing power, consumer goods are relatively lacking. Although the leaders of the National Socialist Party have repeatedly declared, "The foundation of the country lies in labor, not in gold. If foreign countries think that the current German system can be overthrown due to financial problems, they are very wrong," but in fact, the difficulties encountered by the German economy are due to labor problems. For example, in certain sectors, especially agriculture, construction, mining, and metallurgy, there is a shortage of workers and technicians, which affects the output of various consumer goods. In order to absorb unemployed workers, the National Socialist government increased many job opportunities starting in 1933. The total number of workers and employees in various industries, which was originally 12,000,000 in 1933, has increased to 21,000,000 last year. Among them, the agricultural sector even employs 120,000 foreign workers. Therefore, the shortage of labor in various industries is even more obvious. In addition, the German government is actively building defense works in the west, and the number of workers drawn from various industries is very large. When the government, the army, and the National Socialist Party order goods from various industries, they also order the UK to deliver the goods as soon as possible, so the shackles on the German economy are becoming heavier and heavier. The German authorities are now planning to replace manual labor with machines to remedy the situation, but in order to actively manufacture machines, the production of various consumer goods must retreat to a crucial position, and the balance is therefore broken in society. Although the number of workers has increased and their wages have increased, they only have money and cannot purchase various consumer goods, especially fats and textiles. This is the main crux of the German economy. In order to improve this situation, the German authorities have no intention of delaying the military preparations plan. Their only slogan is still "Better cannons than butter." At the same time, because they cannot increase taxes, which has aroused public resentment, they still have to persuade the people to spend their money through indirect methods, such as encouraging people to buy radios, save money to order "civilian cars," and participate in group travel. In addition, the issue of rewarding the export industry is also sufficient to hinder the normal development of the consumer goods manufacturing industry. Because German industry must export goods in exchange for raw materials that the country lacks, but the quantity of German exports decreased significantly last year. The German authorities are deeply afraid that in addition to the joint boycott of Germany by the United Kingdom and the United States, the countries of South America will be affected, which is extremely dangerous for the German economy. Therefore, it is necessary to develop foreign trade with all efforts and place the industries that are purely for domestic consumption in a crucial position. This is another reason for the insufficient application of civilian consumer goods. (February 1 Havas)

### Europe's Crisis Last Year, France Lost 7 Billion Francs

### Konoe is Running Around to Reorganize the Cabinet, Realization is Expected Around the 10th, All Parties are Closely Watching

(Tokyo) Political circles here have been paying close attention to Prime Minister Konoe's actions to strengthen the cabinet in recent days. On New Year's Day, Konoe spent the whole day at his Tokyo residence, first holding talks with Finance Minister Ikeda for two hours, and then holding talks with Cabinet Secretary General Kazami for two and a half hours. Afterwards, Konoe went to a seaside resort in Yokohama to visit Baron Hiranuma, President of the Privy Council, to solicit his opinion. Hiranuma said that he would return to Tokyo tomorrow. It is heard that Konoe hopes to strengthen the cabinet as soon as possible because the parliament will reopen soon. According to political observers, the change will be realized around January 10.

### Foreign Minister of Hungary: Pro-German Policy Faces Widespread Opposition

Budapest, Hungary - Foreign Minister Csáky of Hungary recently expressed his pro-German foreign policy stance in a semi-official statement published by the Hungarian Labor Exchange. This has drawn condemnation from most opposition newspapers and key conservative figures, such as former Prime Minister Gömbös and leader of the Smallholders Party, Eckhardt. They fear Hungary may become a German appendage. Gömbös published an article in the Budapest newspaper "Napló," addressing Germany's plan to support the Ukrainian independence movement, stating, "This is a reckless adventure fraught with crisis, marking the beginning of Slavic invasion into Central Europe. Regardless of its success, it poses a significant danger to Hungary's survival. We have pursued a pro-German policy for two decades, achieving nothing. Today, all thoughtful Hungarians are concerned about our country's future." Eckhardt, in an article in "Magyar Nemzet," argued that Hungarian foreign policy should completely change course and consider Western European countries. He stated, "Hungary has never been subservient to Germany, nor will it be in the future. Hungary's historical mission is to organize the Danube River basin and the Carpathian Mountains (located between the Czech Republic and Poland) are Hungary's natural boundaries, which we will never relinquish. It is true that Hungarian foreign policy should maintain friendship and cooperation with Germany, Italy, and Poland, but we must also consider the economic and financial power of Western European countries. For our country's sake, we should develop economic relations with Western European countries, Poland, and Southern Slavs, to maintain freedom of action with respect to Germany."

### Anglo-German Naval Negotiations Cause Anxiety in British Public Opinion

(Berlin) The newly built 26,000-ton battleship "Scharnhorst" has been completed and is scheduled to join the fleet on the 7th of this month. The German government already has one battleship of the same class, namely the "Gneisenau," and two 35,000-ton battleships under construction. Regarding 10,000-ton cruisers, according to the 1937 Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Germany was originally allowed to build five. Of these, one, the "Prinz Eugen" (equipped with 200mm caliber guns), was launched last August. The "Blücher" and "Admiral Hipper" are nearing completion, and another is under construction. However, the German government, citing the Soviet Union's construction of seven 10,000-ton cruisers, is demanding that the number of Class A cruisers allowed under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement be increased from five to seven. When the British naval delegation came to Berlin yesterday to hold talks with the German naval representatives, the German side raised this issue. (Havas Dispatch, 1st)

(London) Since the German government requested to increase its submarine tonnage to be equal to that of the British submarines, and to increase the number of Class A cruisers from five to seven, British public opinion has become uneasy. Although the Foreign Office issued a communiqué the day before yesterday to reassure the public, it seemed to have little effect. Some newspapers even stated that if the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement is indeed revised, the British naval budget would have to be greatly increased. The Daily Telegraph reported, "The funds required for our country's air force expansion plan may have to be increased to £79,000,000. Now the German government also wants to increase its submarine tonnage to be on par with ours, then our existing destroyer and naval aircraft construction plans must also be expanded proportionally. In that case, the total expenditure required for our country's national defense plan for the next year may have to be increased to £120,000,000." The Daily Express was more optimistic, stating, "This German demand should not be taken seriously. The small submarine fleet built by that country is not considered a threat by Britain. Even German leader Hitler has no intention of challenging Britain on the high seas. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement remains effective in substance." The News Chronicle reported that the submarines built by Germany could, in wartime, control British communication lines in the Mediterranean Sea with greater power. "As such, although Germany has the right to request modifications to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Britain also has the right to reject Germany's construction of new submarines with greater power."

### Chamberlain to Mediate Franco-Italian Dispute and to Visit the Pope to Request Mediation in the Spanish Civil War

(London) Regarding the current relationship between France and Italy, although the French government has clearly stated that it does not want British mediation, according to information obtained here, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will still do his best to encourage British Prime Minister Chamberlain to convey Italy's demands to France. Sir Percy Loraine, the British Ambassador to Italy, has always advocated for negotiations on Italy's demands, even hinting that it would be dangerous if Britain refused to negotiate. Prime Minister Mussolini is therefore increasingly confident that once Prime Minister Chamberlain visits Rome, he can urge him to mediate. However, in light of the Laotian situation, the British government not only does not agree with Ambassador Loraine's views, but even believes that France's attitude is completely justified and skillful. After France refused mediation, Italy, in order to obtain decisive concessions, would first have to take the initiative to resume negotiations with Germany. People close to Prime Minister Chamberlain said that the Prime Minister, when visiting Rome, would not discuss the legitimacy of Italy's demands, but would only put forward some general views, namely: (1) Italy must first take the initiative and propose reasonable solutions to France; (2) If the issue of Italy's intervention in the Spanish Civil War can be resolved, France can adopt a more amenable attitude. In addition, Prime Minister Chamberlain's efforts are said to focus on the Spanish problem, meaning that the mediation of the Spanish Civil War is the key to the international situation. If this war can be ended, foreign intervention can be eliminated in one fell swoop. Even the policy of rapprochement between democratic countries and dictatorships can be continued and may find an answer. In this regard, Prime Minister Chamberlain's visit to Pope Pius XI during his visit to Italy is of great importance. There is no doubt that he will discuss the issue of mediation with the Pope.

### Spanish War Rages On, Calls for Mediation Rise Again

Barcelona - French Ambassador to the Spanish Republican Government, Henri, visited Prime Minister Negrín this afternoon to discuss the general international situation. (Havas Dispatch, 1st)

San Sebastián - According to well-informed sources here, since the arrival of the new French Ambassador to Spain, Henri, the work of "democratizing" the Spanish government has been revitalized. The French ambassador's work is clearly aimed at achieving mediation in the Spanish conflict through the "democratization" of the Spanish government. Based on the phenomena expressed by various parties, it is speculated that the instructions received by the French ambassador and the British chargé d'affaires are similar, both striving to mediate at the request of the Spanish government. At the same time, the Spanish government is also seeking reconciliation with the Roman Catholic Church, seemingly intending to invite Archbishop D'Acosta to mediate. National Army personnel have stated that no matter in what way the government forces conduct mediation, it will inevitably be rejected by the Spanish National Army. (Haitong Press Dispatch, 2nd)

(London) According to reports from Reuters correspondents accompanying the government forces and the National Army on the central front, the government forces continue to exert significant pressure on the National Army troops attacking Catalonia. According to sources in Barcelona, Italian army divisions are currently attacking the town of Viniols, located between Lleida and Tarragona. The government's defensive forces in the machine gun emplacements in the mountains of that area are subjected to intense artillery fire and air raids daily and have been forced to gradually abandon their strongholds. However, the government forces often carry out flanking attacks at night to recover lost territory. It is reported that there is extremely fierce hand-to-hand combat in this battle. According to government forces, the National Army's advance has suffered great sacrifices and has not yet proven that this move poses any danger to the government militarily. According to a battle report from Burgos, there is fighting on the Catalan, Madrid, and Valencia fronts. According to the Spanish News Agency, there is a fierce battle on the Valencia front, and it is acknowledged that the village of Castillos de Villamalefa near Val de Uxo has fallen.

### French Prime Minister Daladier Arrives in Corsica by Ship, Says France Has Ample Self-Defense Capabilities, Italy to Economically Boycott French Territories

Ajaccio - Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier arrived here this morning. The Class A cruiser "Suffren" had sailed into the port since early morning, escorted by a squadron of seaplanes. The Class A cruisers "Colbert" and "Foch," on which Prime Minister Daladier was traveling, and three Class B cruisers and three destroyers, then entered the port. At that time, Minister of the Navy Campinchi, along with former cabinet members Pietri and Landry (both Corsicans), members of both houses of parliament elected from the island of Fezzan, disembarked from the "Suffren." Residents of the port also welcomed them. Prime Minister Daladier then boarded a small boat from the "Foch" at 8:00 AM, amid a cannon salute, and disembarked, immediately leading Army Chief of Staff General Georges, Navy Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Darlan, and Air Force Chief of Staff General Vuillemin to lay a wreath at the war memorial for officers and soldiers who died in the European War. After reviewing the army troops, he went to the Governor's Office. At that time, the Chairman of the Provincial Council, Rocca Serra, delivered a welcoming speech, saying that Corsica is loyal and unwavering. Prime Minister Daladier then went to the City Hall to attend a reception and deliver a speech, which concluded with the words, "France does not need to engage in aggression, nor does it threaten any country. It only needs to maintain sufficient strength, and it already has sufficient strength, which is enough. This is what you can firmly believe, and it is what I want to tell you. Once the naval fleet has circled the island of Corsica, I want every shepherd and fisherman on the island to feel safe. This fleet is the embodiment of France's strength and its affection for Corsica." (Havas Dispatch, 2nd)

Gibraltar - News has just been received here that, except for the central points, most of Abyssinia has not surrendered to Italy, and due to the lack of cash, the economic situation is extremely depressed. The economic life of this port is being boycotted, and transshipment merchants have been notified to quickly transport Italian goods to Abyssinia. The Italian Consul General stationed here has also left for home. (Havas Dispatch, 2nd)

### Poland Receives Imperial Russian Royal Jewels

Warsaw - Most of the treasures of the former Russian royal family were taken into custody by the Polish government yesterday. The valuable pearls and jewels include the crown of Nicholas I, the diamond necklace and pearl ring of Empress Feodorovna, and the crown of Alexander II, with a total value of 15,000,000 gold rubles. These treasures were previously stored in the vaults of the Polish National Bank. Article in the Treaty of Riga signed by Poland and the Soviet Union in 1921, Russia agreed to return Polish national treasures and pearls seized before the war. These treasures were collected during the Polish Revolution in 1830, worth 30,000,000 gold rubles. In 1923, because the Soviet Union did not return them, Poland agreed to use the Romanov treasures as compensation, but the Soviet government had the right to redeem them within fifteen years. The term expired at the end of December 1938, so they are now returned to the Polish national permanent custody. (Haitong Press Dispatch, 2nd)

### Observations on the Way Back to Shanghai from Changsha via Ji'an: People's Efforts in Industrial Cooperation Seek to Solve the Refugee Problem

The China Press reports that the following is extracted from the notes of a traveler who recently returned to Shanghai from near Changsha, describing the efforts of the Chinese government and the people to organize 30,000 industrial cooperatives to solve the refugee problem and revive the country.

As night fell, the train left Changsha and headed east for Jinhua, two or three days' journey away. As we left, we saw hundreds of male and female laborers clearing the rubble from the streets and collecting debris among the ruins. Changsha originally had a population of 500,000, of course, most of whom had fled. The carriages were full of passengers and luggage, very few of whom were originally residents of Changsha, returning to inspect their property, knowing very well that they could not stay, so they took the train elsewhere. But it was unclear why they were heading east, as most refugees were heading west. Traveling south along the Yuehan Railway from near Changsha, Shaoyang in southwestern Hunan was a gathering place, as it was the terminus of long-distance buses and a refugee center. The train did not reach Nanchang, but stopped at Zhangshu, 45 miles south of Nanchang, across the Gan River. I left the train to undergo the usual inspection of luggage and documents. There is often fear of spies in Zhangshu, so the inspectors paid special attention to maps and photographs. From Zhangshu, I took a long-distance bus south to Ji'an to meet with several merchants. The highway winds through the steep mountains of the Gan River basin. In the summer, this is a rice and tea producing area, but now it is planted with beans and wheat. There are people walking everywhere, mostly refugee groups from the Yangtze River basin, resting by the highway, or traveling by rickshaw or wheelbarrow, or collapsing on the road. Ji'an is now quite prosperous. A tea merchant described how the authorities care for the refugees, saying that two weeks ago, one Chinese and one foreigner went to Ji'an to post notices about industrial cooperatives and recruit workers. The local people had been unable to transport their tea, ramie cloth, and other goods out of Nanchang and Jiujiang, so they and a large number of refugees were overjoyed to hear this. After the notice was posted, many people applied. After interviews, the cooperative office began to provide loans and start work. Soon, I went to a small street office to inquire and met the two people leading this movement. Although they were extremely busy, they were still very welcoming, inviting me to dinner and letting me stay overnight, as the long-distance bus back to Zhangshu was canceled that day. The foreigner was Mr. Hallcombe, and the Chinese was Ms. Li Wanpei (transliteration). Both had worked as engineers in Guangzhou and were invited by the Industrial Cooperative Association to serve in the cooperative. We ate Chinese food, and during the meal, the two talked enthusiastically about the progress of their work, starting the necessary industries in this rich and backward province of Jiangxi. They are working closely with the Jiangxi Refugee Relief Joint Association and the Rural Reconstruction Bureau to designate the area south of Taihe as a refugee reclamation area. But the current need is only a small part of agricultural production. With the outside supply sources for the people of this area now cut off, there is an urgent need for a large number of goods. To meet this need, the industrial cooperative movement has begun. The people can all work, and there are many who need goods. Because there are a large number of raw materials in the area, and resources have not yet been exploited, this movement is very smooth. According to Mr. Hallcombe, the area is quite rich, but the people are conservative. Iron, coal, lead, zinc, manganese, tungsten, silver, gold, antimony, ramie, and tobacco are all produced, but machinery is lacking. I asked what progress had been made so far. Mr. Hallcombe said that since August 1938, there have been four general headquarters and more than 100 cooperatives. The plan is to develop local resources as much as possible. Because transportation is inconvenient, the Ji'an Cooperative has started to manufacture straw sandals, boats, matches, paper, oil extracted from tea and plant seeds, and fine cloth woven from ramie and cotton. After dinner, the three of us went to the general office and visited a cooperative workshop that manufactured small boats. The workshop was on the riverbank, with 30 workers manufacturing sampans. The foreman was an experienced shipbuilder, formerly in Hangzhou, now leading workers to manufacture here. The Ji'an office loaned this foreman 850 yuan, with a one-year term, which he used to buy wood and start building ships. Because river transport is prosperous, there is a great need for ships. The proceeds from the sale, after deducting expenses, are divided among the workers, so the workers work very hard. In the afternoon, I took a tour of the countryside in the mountains. The villages were all very quiet and had not yet revealed the horror of war. The local farmers said that the war was still far away from here. If the Japanese army arrives here, they will rise up to resist. The next morning, I took a long-distance bus north back to Zhangshu, which is now very busy with military defense and railway transportation. From Zhangshu, I took a small train to Jinhua, which has now been changed to the provincial capital of Zhejiang Province. Various government offices are now located there. From there, I took a long-distance bus and small boat circuitously to Ningbo, and then took a boat back to Shanghai. The six-day journey was thus concluded.

### Hong Kong Catholic Magazine Viciously Criticizes Japanese Army's Arbitrary Actions: Neither Like Disciplined Soldiers nor Civilized People

The Continental Daily News reports that the Hong Kong Catholic magazine "The Rock" viciously criticizes the Japanese army's arbitrary actions during the southern invasion. It is reported that the fighting outside the Hong Kong border is not as barbaric as it was a year ago. This is certainly pleasing, but this means that the Japanese army is no longer stabbing unarmed civilians in the streets, and the number of women being raped is not as high as in the past when bombing cities and towns with airplanes, artillery from the sea or mountain peaks, machine guns from tanks, and throwing grenades. Today, the level of war has reached the point where we have become accustomed to the barbaric acts in this war, and we are no longer shocked unless there is a mass slaughter. The villages of Guangdong Province are often completely destroyed because the Japanese soldiers force the people to burn their homes to the ground for their amusement. If a Japanese soldier is shot by someone, they will kill hundreds of civilians in retaliation. If the war in Guangdong can be taken as an example of the entire war in China, then this kind of war not only completely disregards the conventions of civilized warfare, but also, from the phenomenon, there is no distinction between a civilized army and a group of barbarians. The people who fled from the war zone into Hong Kong have recounted the terrors of war they experienced, saying that even if there were no Chinese soldiers in the entire area, they would still be swept by machine gun fire, regardless of civilian lives, and that there was no way to save one's own life except by selling out one's compatriots. Judging from the actions of the invading army, they are truly fond of slaughter and destruction, and are neither like disciplined soldiers nor like civilized people. This is the final blow to Japan's reputation in Hong Kong. Even Japan's best friends no longer defend the actions of the Japanese army and its leaders, because after careful consideration of humanity, they have had to change their attitude. But the war in South China is not as shocking as the war in North China, which has shocked the world. There are also some events in the war in South China that are extremely shocking and would be almost unbelievable if they were not personally spoken of by absolutely reliable eyewitnesses. For example, one town, because it had no adequate means of defense, decided not to resist, but the Japanese army would only not harass the town under certain conditions, one of which was that the town provide a certain number of women. The town was unwilling to accept this condition, as would any other town in China, any town of a nation that had not lost its sense of shame, so it resisted until the town was completely destroyed. But this is only one of many unforgettable events. There is also ironclad evidence of the destruction of churches and church property. We have heard news from the Hong Kong border that when the Japanese army occupied a certain number of houses, they cleaned out the excrement in the houses when they left, making them cleaner than before the occupation. But this was intentionally done by the Japanese army to win the praise of foreign eyewitnesses. This has never happened where newspaper reporters have not set foot. In the guerrilla areas of Guangdong, a total of 20 Catholic churches and other buildings have been destroyed. Some churches were in a state similar to pigsties after the Japanese army left. In other churches, the barbarity and thoroughness with which the Japanese army desecrated sacred objects was unmatched. But more painful than the actions of the invading army is the memory left in the minds of the large number of refugees. We still remember this memory vividly. These people were clearly in a hurry to carry a few items, preferring to flee for their lives rather than fall into the hands of the Japanese army. Most of them did not flee from towns that were about to become battlefields, but from undefended rural areas, and all had indescribable terror, which came with the footsteps of the infamous army. If we consider these things to be ordinary events in today's war, then civilization itself is in danger.

### Unsuccessful Attack by Japanese Troops on Chongde; Chinese Patriots Fight Heroically, Killing Over a Hundred Enemy Soldiers

(Chongde Correspondence) Since our county fell into enemy hands last year and became a guerrilla zone, patriotic people from towns, markets, villages, and hamlets within the county have all left their homes to join the army and fight the enemy. Consequently, the strength of the guerrilla forces in the area has steadily increased, and the Japanese troops no longer dare to venture out and ravage the countryside. The villagers have thus enjoyed peace and quiet. Furthermore, the Chinese army maintains strict discipline, so the people not only deeply respect them but are also happy to assist in their work. This truly represents the best example of military-civilian cooperation in the war of resistance. Unfortunately, in the middle of last month, a key base of our Chinese army was discovered by a traitor, who then secretly reported all the details to the Japanese authorities. Due to their limited strength, the Japanese did not dare to attack, so no fighting was heard there until the beginning of this month. It was then decided that the Chinese army would launch a full-scale offensive. Therefore, a large number of reinforcements were transferred from the eastern Zhejiang area and distributed to various locations. After these reinforcements – divisions, brigades, and regiments – arrived, a traitor again secretly reported to the Japanese. Fearing that the Chinese army's lines of communication would be established in the future and that their strength would be difficult to eliminate, the Japanese immediately mobilized a large force from Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other places. They also ordered Xu Pucheng, the "Jiangsu-Zhejiang Pacification Commander," to quickly send his puppet troops to the county to join the local Japanese troops. They advanced along both land and water routes and many Japanese and puppet soldiers were sent from Tongxiang to jointly besiege the Chinese army's positions. However, the Chinese army had received a secret report in advance and had already dug zigzagging trenches more than ten miles long around the base. They had also piled up a large number of sandbags and other materials. Thus, when the Japanese troops had not yet reached the Lujiaqiao area, the Chinese army launched a head-on attack. The Japanese soldiers hastily responded and once attempted to attack the Chinese defensive works with artillery fire, but all shots missed. Later, as the Chinese soldiers fought more and more bravely, disregarding sacrifice, they leaped out of the trenches under heavy artillery fire and stormed the Japanese, completely defeating the enemy troops. Just as the Chinese army was celebrating its victory, a burst of gunfire suddenly erupted from behind. It turned out that the Japanese troops were attacking from the rear, attempting to encircle us. At that time, for strategic reasons, the Chinese army temporarily retreated to the Majiayang area. Unexpectedly, the Japanese troops pursued, and the Chinese forces had no choice but to fight back fiercely. It is said that after four hours of intense fighting, the Chinese forces, with their superior strength and the dedication of their soldiers, finally routed all six or seven hundred Japanese soldiers, who scattered and fled in all directions. In this battle, over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed, and over two hundred rifles, countless bullets, and six or seven hundred pieces of military clothing and blankets were captured.

### Commemorating the Fall of Hangzhou: Tragedy Strikes a Theater Performance in Lishui; Collapsed Building Kills and Injures Over Eighty People

Lishui Correspondence: All sectors of Lishui held a solemn commemoration on the 24th, the one-year anniversary of the fall of Hangzhou. At 7 p.m. that evening, a theatrical performance was held at Wenchang Pavilion for propaganda purposes. Over three thousand people attended. After the opening ceremony, County Magistrate Zhu Zhangbao delivered a speech. Just as the curtain was about to rise for the performance, a violent explosion occurred from the backstage upstairs. The dressing room had suddenly collapsed, and the actors fell into the debris of broken tiles and rafters. The audience, unaware of the true situation, panicked and lost all order. Although there were seven steps, each five feet high, in front of the gate, the crowd, in a state of terror, scrambled to escape, resulting in a pile-up of people falling on top of each other. Those who followed trampled over them. At that moment, the chaotic sounds of people shouting and crying merged into one, ultimately leading to a tragedy. Most of the deaths and injuries were caused by trampling. By midnight, twenty-two deaths had been confirmed, and fifteen bodies had been claimed by their families. Seven bodies remained unclaimed. Over sixty people were injured and were sent to the rescue team and Fumin Hospital, both of which were full. The daughter of Education Director Xu Shaodi and the daughter of Chuzhong Principal Zhao Zhongsu, who were also participating in the performance, suffered minor injuries. Yu Zixian, the director of the Chuzhong Affiliated Elementary School, was seriously injured while tending to the backstage.

### Over Ten Thousand Refugees Cultivating Land in the Snow; Xiang-Gan University Prefigures a Bountiful Harvest

According to someone who recently traveled from Xiang-Gan (Hunan-Jiangxi) through Zhejiang to Shanghai, the people in the areas where our troops are stationed are increasingly supportive of the war of resistance. The military and government authorities are both fighting the war and building a prosperous society, which is very encouraging. In early this month, it snowed heavily in various counties of southern Hunan and northern Jiangxi. After the winter plowing was completed, the people welcomed this auspicious snow, all hoping for a bountiful harvest next year. Agricultural development has not been hindered by the war, which is a good sign for the future of the war of resistance. Many counties bordering Zhejiang and Jiangxi have also experienced snowfall. The refugees are the ones suffering the most, but they are still able to endure hardship and work hard for the final victory of the war of resistance. Over ten thousand refugees have been moved from the war zone to Xiang-Gan to cultivate land. They work diligently all day long without complaint. However, most of these people fled in the spring and summer, and now they lack cotton clothing in this severe cold. Therefore, they hope that people from all over can donate as much cold-weather clothing and leather clothing as possible. Transportation from Hunan to Jiangxi and from Jiangxi to Zhejiang is as smooth as usual. After passing through Jinhua in Zhejiang, transportation becomes slightly more difficult because that area is closer to the front lines. However, ordinary merchants, women, and children can still pass through without obstruction. The import and export trade in the inland areas is quite prosperous. Japanese goods have completely disappeared. If the people in the occupied areas could also unanimously use only domestic goods, that would be the only benefit for China after the Sino-Japanese War. What we saw along the way filled us with good feelings and can be used to comfort our countrymen.

### Puppet Organization Appears in Guangzhou; Peng Dongyuan and Lü Chunrong Serve as Puppet Chairmen; Guangzhou Has Become a Dead City, But Gambling and Opium are Thriving

Hong Kong Correspondence: At the beginning of the fall of Guangzhou, a puppet organization called the "Guangzhou Women's Maintenance Association" appeared, presided over by two female traitors. One was a former female clerk in the Guangzhou Local Court, and the other was a well-known female gangster. However, for more than a month, this puppet organization has not achieved any special results and is disliked by the Japanese. Therefore, personnel from the Japanese special service organs have been running around trying to gather support, and now another puppet "Guangzhou Public Security Maintenance Committee" has appeared. This puppet organization has Peng Dongyuan as the puppet chairman, Lü Chunrong as the puppet vice-chairman, and a certain Chen as the secretary-general. A certain Shang, a certain Liang, a certain Liao, and a certain Zhuo are the committee members. Liang and Liao are unknown. Shang was a lawyer, and Zhuo is the son of a businessman. This group of traitors held a ceremony on the 20th of December at noon at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall to assume their puppet posts. There were more Japanese military and government representatives present than there were traitors. Peng and Lü delivered speeches one after another, and the Japanese representatives also took the stage to lecture. In addition, so-called "citizen representatives" also took the stage to sing praises. Finally, the puppet secretary-general, Chen, led the chanting of slogans, and the ceremony concluded. The slogans were strange and absurd: (1) China and Japan are good friends, (2) Long live the new government, (3) Long live the public security maintenance committee.

When the members of the puppet Public Security Maintenance Committee took their puppet posts, the Japanese and traitors sent people to the Changdi Henan area to buy a large number of beggars to line up and assemble in the open square outside the Zhongshan Memorial Hall to shout slogans in order to decorate the facade. At that time, the scene outside the Memorial Hall was filled with people with crooked heads, limping feet, patched clothes, and dirty faces, looking extremely ugly. Unexpectedly, just as the puppet ceremony was underway, a commotion suddenly broke out in the crowd of beggars. The puppet organization recruited beggars and paid each person a salary of three corners, but those who were responsible for the recruitment took the opportunity to embezzle the money, giving two corners, one and a half corners, or one corner, with varying prices. After they inquired with each other, those who only received one or two corners all protested. The Japanese troops, seeing that the situation was not good, immediately sealed off the square with bayonets, and a group of beggars had no way to disperse. When the puppet ceremony ended, they marched through the city under the leadership of small traitors. As a result, Japanese and traitor newspapers advertised "Celebrating the establishment of the new government of Guangzhou, 30,000 citizens enthusiastically paraded."

After Guangzhou was occupied, the scene was extremely desolate. According to a certain missionary who had just arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago on a British gunboat, although the traitors in Guangzhou were very active, posting notices everywhere, carrying out propaganda, and attracting refugees to return home to live, and sending representatives to Hong Kong to promote their activities and issue so-called "passes" to persuade people fleeing Hong Kong to return to Guangzhou as soon as possible, the results were completely ineffective. Moreover, the city lacked food, fuel, vegetables, and drinking water. Due to the robberies by traitors, most of the residents who had not yet escaped were trying to find a chance to escape, and those who had already fled would not dare to return easily, throwing themselves into the net. As for the Japanese side, they had recently brought four or five hundred overseas Chinese men and women on transport ships, most of whom were vagrants and prostitutes. After arriving, they originally wanted to open brothels, teahouses, cafes, etc., but the city was deserted day and night, and the Japanese troops were frequently deployed and moved about hastily. This made it impossible for them to open for business and have customers. Therefore, the Japanese merchants and prostitutes who wanted to go to the province to do business were greatly disappointed.

After the Japanese troops arrived in Guangzhou, they incited vagrants and traitors to sell drugs and open gambling houses very actively. At present, it is impossible to accurately estimate the prevalence of opium and red pills in Guangzhou. These large quantities of drugs were transported into the Pearl River by Japanese warships along with guns, ammunition, and bombs, and were sold by the pacification teams. Up to now, 50 red pill shops and 40 opium shops have been opened in the city, and there are more than 30 others being prepared but not yet officially opened. In addition, there are 70 or 80 other informal selling and smoking places, so the daily consumption of drugs is quite alarming. As for the gambling houses, now that the puppet maintenance association has appeared, the traitors' funding has not yet been secured, so the large-scale gambling business is likely to be restored. It is also rumored that Peng Dongyuan, in order to promote the policy of enslavement, is planning to actively develop the opium and gambling industries to the nearby occupied areas in order to increase revenue.

### Puppet Hangzhou City Government Anxiously Seeks to Restore the Market at the City Railway Station, But Fails; Holds a Korean Product Exhibition; Chinese Patriots Seize the Opportunity to Assassinate Puppets

(Hangzhou Correspondence) After the city of Hangzhou fell last year, shops in all districts stopped their business, leading to deserted and desolate roads. Since the establishment of the puppet city government, the Japanese have repeatedly ordered the resumption of commerce and ordered residents to move back within a limited time. Those who procrastinated or hesitated would have their houses confiscated. Therefore, some of the population was forced to move back to live and, in order to maintain a living, opened small shops and stalls (mostly restaurants, taverns, teahouses, and tobacco shops) only in the sections around Qixia San Yuan Fang, Yanling Road, and Yingzi Road. The areas around the railway station, because they are close to the railway and important transportation routes, often experience fighting. Therefore, no one lives there to this day, making it desolate and lonely, completely different from the human world. Recently, the Japanese, under the pretext of restoring the market in order to use fake Chinese as a shield to reduce the attacks by the Chinese army (because the Chinese army is extremely protective of the common people; if a place has many residents, they will often reduce attacks to avoid the tragic deaths of civilians), ordered the puppet city government to fully revive the commercial market in that area. The puppet mayor, He Zhan, repeatedly consulted with Yishi Longshou, the section chief of the special service organ, and decided to first force the residents to move back and establish a City Railway Station Restoration Management Office, appointing Chen Keli as the puppet director. The puppet office has three sections: business, engineering, and general affairs. It is now known that the office has delineated the area east to Lingzhi Road and south to Yangshi Street, forcing the owners to repair their houses and forcibly conscripting laborers to organize transportation and repair roads. All materials are taken from the plundered civilian factories. It is said that although the project has been completed, no one has moved to the area to open a shop, causing the puppet mayor great anxiety. Therefore, he consulted with the Japanese again, and as a result, they decided to use economic incentives and promulgated ninety-two loan rules. The intention on the surface is to assist commerce, but in reality, it is to exploit the common people. Therefore, when the people first heard that the city government had loans to assist in the restoration of businesses, they all rushed to get application forms. However, after reading the restrictive rules, they realized that it was nothing more than an open loan sharking institution, so they were unwilling to take out loans and go there to operate. Moreover, it is said that the funds designated for the people are all Japanese military scrip.

(Another dispatch) In order to carry out economic aggression and absorb our country's economy, the Japanese recently opened a Korean product exhibition at the former National Goods Exhibition Hall in Hangzhou. All the exhibits, such as the aquatic products from the Jeolla Buk-do Fisheries Association, the Korean paper sandals from Gyeongsang Buk-do, the various medicinal materials and plywood from the Daegu Fisheries and Pharmaceutical Association, and bicycles and materials, etc., have been exhibited, but since the opening, apart from the officials of the puppet organization who have visited, our people have suffered deeply from the Japanese and are all united in their hatred of the enemy. Therefore, they are unwilling to buy these smuggled goods. As a result, from the opening to the closing, the event has been extremely deserted and desolate. It is said that the puppet provincial and city mayors Zai Ruikai and He Zhan all participated in the ceremony on the opening day, and our Chinese patriotic soldiers seized the opportunity to mingle among the traitors and fired more than ten shots in a row. The order was chaotic for a time, and the Japanese and puppet personnel all scrambled to escape. At that time, our soldiers were able to retreat safely in the chaos. After the puppet police received the news and rushed to the museum to investigate, the puppet provincial governor, Cheng Bu, was slightly injured, Xie Huchen's right arm was hit by a bullet, and He Zhan fell to the ground uninjured in shock. The police immediately called ambulances to send the wounded to the hospital for treatment and announced a temporary curfew, conducting a major search in the surrounding area, but with no results. Since then, the puppet provincial governor and others have been living in seclusion. When going to the puppet office, they must travel in their own cars, and declare a curfew on the roads they pass, cutting off pedestrians.

### Zhejiang Construction Secretary Qiu Yuanxiong Detained for Embezzlement

Suspended from Duty and Placed Under Supervision Pending Investigation. Wenzhou Correspondence: The Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, believing that Wenzhou is located on the coast and is an important trading port in the province after the war of resistance, and that industry and commerce are very prosperous there, felt that factories should be relocated inland as soon as possible to avoid being destroyed by the enemy during this time of intense war. Therefore, on August 1, the Wenzhou Factory Relocation Committee was established, with the chairmen of the various trade associations in Wenzhou as members, and the department secretary Qiu Yuanxiong was appointed as the director, responsible for presiding over the relocation. There were originally 22 iron factories, 19 printing factories, 34 sawmills, 26 rice mills, 8 dyeing and weaving factories, Puming Electric Plant, Dongou Telephone Company, Guangming Match Factory, Baihao Milk Company, Taohua Food Company, and several other factories in Wenzhou. Since the start of the relocation, most of them have been relocated. Those that have been moved inland (including 15 iron factories, 9 dyeing and weaving factories, and many sawmills) will be purchased by the government, and the government will set a price and submit it to the province for approval. They are preparing to organize a valuation committee, but for months, this has not been implemented, and merchants and civilians feel quite distressed. Recently, the Military Discipline Inspection Group of the Military Affairs Commission has received secret reports that Qiu Yuanxiong has used his position in the relocation committee to extort large sums of money from companies and factories (it is said that he asked a certain milk company for 5,000 yuan, and other companies for 300-500 yuan). Those who paid were allowed to temporarily postpone the relocation. Later, Provincial Chairman Huang heard about this and summoned Qiu Yuanxiong (Qiu usually resides at the Bank of China in Wenzhou) to the department at 8 p.m. on the 13th via long-distance telephone to Xu Zongwu, the 8th District Commissioner and Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander, and had him detained. At the same time, he telegraphed the Construction Department to suspend Qiu from his duties pending investigation. It was also investigated that Qiu, while serving as the county magistrate of Pinghu County last year, took the opportunity to embezzle 20,000 yuan of public funds in November when our troops in western Zhejiang were transferred. Afterwards, Kang Saiqi, the director of the county treasury, returned to the province and reported him (Kang was given 2,000 yuan by Qiu and has already turned it over to the provincial treasury; the accounting director received 1,000 yuan, but his whereabouts are unknown). It is said that Qiu later admitted to paying back part of the money, but it has not yet been cleared. This case is still under investigation, and it is feared that if both crimes are revealed, Qiu will not be able to escape the law.

### Japanese Invaders in China Show All Signs of Distress; Japanese Troops in Zhenjiang Haven't Been Paid for Months; Japanese Troops in Rugao Are Internally Hollow; Japanese Troops Harassing Shatou Were Annihilated

Taixian Special Dispatch: Someone recently came to Taixian from Zhenjiang and talked about the Japanese troops in Zhenjiang, who are experiencing economic panic and have not been paid for several months, so the market has also been affected. Because each Japanese soldier's pockets are empty, they are not as wealthy as before, and they all show signs of distress. No one passes through the Wangjinqiao area in the city after 7 p.m. every night, because even if one carries hundreds of coins, they will be taken away by the Japanese troops.

The Japanese troops in Rugao now number about 600, but half of them are Zhuangding (strong young men) drawn from various parts of southern Jiangsu. They are stationed inside and outside the city, also wearing Japanese military uniforms, but they have no guns in their hands. The internal hollowness of the troops can be seen from this. On the morning of the 22nd, four Japanese soldiers were suddenly discovered in Shatou Town, Jiangbei, on a small motorboat, attempting to harass the town. They were all annihilated by the Chinese guerrilla forces, and the small motorboat was captured.

### Zhejiang Civil Servants' Living Expenses; Standards of Payment; Increased by 30% to 50% Compared to a Year Ago

(Jinhua Correspondence) Since the provincial government moved east at the end of last year, the living expenses of civil servants in the provincial agencies have been reduced to the minimum due to financial difficulties. A year has now passed. Since the provincial finances have been reorganized and tax revenues have gradually increased, and after repeated requests from various parties, the 1031st meeting of the provincial government on December 13 passed an amendment to the standards for wartime civil servants' living expenses, increasing them by 30% to 50% compared to before. These are recorded as follows: (1) The provincial government chairman, committee members, secretary-general, department heads, and bureau chiefs each receive 240 yuan per month, and the administrative inspectors and commissioners of each district receive 200 yuan per month; (2) Secretaries, section chiefs, accounting officers, and other appointed officials of the provincial government's departments and bureaus receive 100 to 180 yuan per month, depending on their qualifications and the complexity of their work.

Clerks receive 40 to 50 yuan per month, and scribes receive 25 to 40 yuan per month, with each grade increasing by 5 yuan; (3) The salaries of police agencies at all levels will be appropriately increased by the Department of Civil Affairs in accordance with this standard; (4) The amount of living expenses for the staff of the commissioner's offices and district security headquarters will be appropriately increased by the Department of Civil Affairs in conjunction with the Security Department in accordance with this standard; (5) County magistrates of Class A and First-Class B counties receive 160 yuan per month, county magistrates of Second-Class counties receive 140 yuan per month, and county magistrates of Third-Class counties receive 120 yuan per month. Secretaries, section chiefs, and club directors of county governments receive 50 to 80 yuan per month, section members and accounting officers receive 40 to 50 yuan per month, clerks and assistant members receive 25 to 40 yuan per month, and scribes receive 15 to 25 yuan per month, with each grade increasing by 5 yuan; (6) The living expenses of staff members of provincial department-affiliated agencies and provincial business agencies will be determined by comparing their original positions with those of staff members in one grade of Article 2, and setting the living expenses separately according to the same article; (7) The living expenses of staff members of county government-affiliated agencies and county business agencies will be determined separately in accordance with Article 5, following the method in the previous article; (8) The living expenses paid in accordance with this standard are exempt from all taxes except stamp duty income tax; (9) All provinces and counties shall uniformly implement this standard; (10) Those whose expenses exceed this standard will still be paid at the original amount; (11) Special official expenses for the heads of departments and bureaus of the provincial government, special official expenses for district commanders, and special official expenses for county magistrates will be paid in accordance with the originally established budget allocation table; (12) This standard was approved by the Provincial Government Committee and promulgated on January 1, 28th year of the Republic (1939), but it is stipulated that the increased salaries of each county will be paid from the county funds.

### Development of Inter-Provincial Transportation in Fujian

Fuzhou Correspondence: The economic hub of Fujian Province has now shifted from the coast to the interior. In order to develop inter-provincial trade, the authorities have planned to launch joint transportation between Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces. Joint transportation between Fujian and Zhejiang has already been implemented, and the connecting point is the Jiangpu section, that is, from Jiangshan County in Zhejiang Province to Pucheng County in Fujian Province. The business is quite developed. Joint transportation between Fujian and Jiangxi has also been launched this month, starting from Yanping in Fujian Province and ending in Nanchang in Jiangxi Province. There is one direct train every day, and there is no need to change trains or tickets in the middle. It takes two days to arrive. If you take a steamboat from Fuzhou to Yanping, and then take a car from Yanping to Nanchang, it will take three days to arrive. Transportation is extremely convenient. Therefore, the Postal Administration has recently transferred the mail from foreign countries to Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces through Fuzhou in order to be nimble. Currently, this route is first used for passenger transport, and freight transport will be launched next year. The highway freight rates in this province are also lower than in other provinces. For example, the average freight rate per 50 kilograms per kilometer is six cents in other provinces, but only four cents or three and a half cents, or even three cents in Fujian. The freight rate for native products is as low as two and a half cents or two cents, and the freight rate for food is even lower, only one and a half cents per 50 kilograms per kilometer. In addition, the number of bus trips on the Fuzhou-Xinghua-Quanzhou line and the Yanping-Shaxian-Yongan line has been increased. The telephone lines on the Yongchun-Dehua-Datian line have been completed, and the roadbeds and pavements on the Yongan-Liancheng-Changting line have also been improved. The Yongan station and vehicle factory have begun construction, and the station buildings in Sanyuan and Xinkou in Shaxian and Gongzhou and Hongtian in Liancheng will be completed soon. In recent months, the highway operating income of the entire province has increased to more than 180,000 yuan per month after the rectification. Although the costs have increased (gasoline has increased from 1.14 yuan per gallon to 1.81 yuan per gallon, and tires have increased from 80 yuan each to 180 yuan), the most prosperous highway line from Quanzhou to Xiamen, although destroyed after the fall of Xiamen, still has a slight surplus after offsetting income and expenses. The supply of materials and oil has also been fully stocked, which is sufficient for use. In addition, the import and export trade in Fuzhou has been booming recently. The major export goods are timber, fruits, paper, and sugar, and the import goods are not only for the province's own use but are also transshipped to Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces. There has been frequent traffic of foreign ships between Shanghai and Fuzhou recently, and most merchants engaged in the import and export business have made profits. It is expected that the New Year will pass smoothly for the commercial and financial sectors. (December 23)

### Zhangjiagang; Still Difficult to Stop Overseas Ships; Report of Bombing of Taizixu Port Is Untrue

Changyinsha Correspondence: Since the suspension of navigation at Zhangjiagang, all overseas merchant ships have changed to stopping at Taizixu Port and Hucao Port. However, the transportation of passengers and goods is not as convenient as at Zhangjiagang. Moreover, due to the low water level in winter, the sandy beaches are wide, making transshipment difficult. The overseas shipping companies and the internal port transshipment companies recently held a meeting to discuss resuming stops at Zhangjiagang. However, because Japanese troops are stationed there, there are many obstacles. Although several rounds of negotiations have been held and some progress has been made, it will still take some time before Zhangjiagang is officially restored, and it is unlikely to happen in the near future. Taizixu Port has been very peaceful recently, and there has been no shelling incident. Only the internal ports, such as Hucao Port, have 30 to 40 Japanese puppet troops stationed there, causing unrest among the local residents.

Shanghai Special Edition

### Shanghai Under the Administration of the Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office

— Xuan Nan

On February 1st of the 14th year of the Republic of China, Han Guojun, the Governor of Jiangsu Province, decided to establish Shanghai as a special municipality. He telegraphed and appointed Li Zhongjue, the head of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and ten others as preparatory committee members to discuss and decide on the name "Songhu Special Municipality" and to discuss the area of the special municipality. In early June, Duan Qirui, the Chief Executive, specially appointed Sun Baoqi as the Director督辦 of the Songhu Municipal Area, with Yu Hede and Li Zhongjue as Assistant Directors會辦. However, although the order was issued, Sun Baoqi did not take office, and the special municipality proposal was shelved. The following year, the 15th year of the Republic of China, the Jiangsu Governor, Sun Chuanfang, organized the Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office. On May 3rd, Sun Chuanfang arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing, and the next day announced the establishment of the Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office. Sun Chuanfang held an inauguration ceremony as Director督辦, and promulgated thirteen articles of the Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office's organizational outline, the main seven of which are as follows:

Article 1: The Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office manages administrative, diplomatic, security, and other affairs within the Songhu Commercial Port area, and supervises local autonomous affairs within the commercial port.

Article 2: The Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office shall have one Director督辦, concurrently held by the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, who shall be responsible for all political affairs; and one Director-General總辦, appointed by the Commander-in-Chief, who shall report to the Director督辦, supervise and guide all staff of the office, and execute the duties of the office. When the Director督辦 is not in the office, the Director-General總辦 may act on his behalf. However, in the event of important matters, instructions must still be sought for handling.

Article 6: The Foreign Affairs Department handles all foreign affairs within the commercial port area.

Article 7: The Political Affairs Department handles all administrative affairs within the commercial port area.

Article 8: The Security Department handles all public security and hygiene affairs within the commercial port area.

Article 9: The Public Works Department handles port affairs, roads, bridges, waterways, and civil engineering affairs of municipal autonomy in public construction within the commercial port area.

Article 10: The Finance Department handles the income and expenditure affairs of the office and the commercial port area. When Sun Chuanfang took office, he stated: "After the Jiangsu-Zhejiang war last year, the overall situation in the Southeast has temporarily calmed down, but the Songhu issue urgently needs to be resolved. The former government had a proposal to designate Songhu as a special zone, but it has not yet become a reality, and the people have been longing for it for a long time. Now that Jiangsu and Zhejiang have become one family, the opening of Songhu as a commercial port is even more urgent. Therefore, I have started organizing it and announced its establishment in the shortest possible time. The position of Director督辦 cannot be divided due to the exercise of power. I have no choice but to hold it concurrently. However, my military affairs are numerous, and time is quite limited. Therefore, I have specially invited Mr. Ding Wenjiang to serve as Director-General總辦 so that he can be responsible for the progress nearby. After the establishment of the Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office, please urge the local gentry to supervise it strictly to achieve perfection." After Sun Chuanfang took office, he issued a proclamation, saying:

"Proclamation: In order to announce matters, it is noted that this office is now established. Article 2 of the organizational outline of the Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office states: 'The Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office shall have one Director督辦, concurrently held by the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces,' etc. Based on this, I, the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, have chosen to take office as Director督辦兼任督辦 at 10:00 AM on May 4th of the 15th year of the Republic of China. This is to inform you, the military and civilians, one and all. Be sure to take heed. This proclamation is hereby issued."

Ding Wenjiang, the Director-General of the Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office, resigned on December 12th due to injuries sustained in a car accident. His time in office was seven months. The most significant event during these seven months was the recovery of the Mixed Court (會審公廨), because it was related to the concessions. The process is briefly described below.

When the May Fourth Movement occurred in the 8th year of the Republic of China, the citizens of Shanghai realized the practical effect of participating in political movements. At that time, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession happened to increase taxes. The citizens also jointly planned countermeasures to resist it. On the one hand, they demanded that the Municipal Council cancel the tax increase proposal, and on the other hand, they demanded that the Municipal Council establish Chinese directors華董, etc. In January of the following year, the Municipal Council agreed to establish five Chinese advisors華顧問. After the May 30th Massacre, the Chinese side put forward thirteen demands, including the establishment of Chinese directors華董 and the recovery of the Mixed Court公廨, etc. Although they did not achieve full victory, the problem of recovering the Mixed Court公廨 was finally resolved to a considerable extent.

The consular body's occupation and management rights of the Mixed Court公廨 occurred during the Xinhai Revolution. Since the winter of the second year of the Republic of China, our country has repeatedly negotiated, but with little result. After the May 30th Incident, the recovery of the Mixed Court公廨 was listed as one of the thirteen conditions, but was opposed by the diplomatic corps. Afterwards, the government separated the recovery of the Mixed Court公廨 from other conditions, and negotiated it separately. It was decided to hold discussions in Beijing in the spring of the 15th year of the Republic of China. However, due to the unstable political situation, the negotiations were ineffective. The Jiangsu Provincial Government took the opportunity to negotiate with the consular body as a local case. From the time Sun Chuanfang came to Shanghai to take office as the Songhu Commercial Port督辦, Ding Wenjiang began negotiations with the consular body. On August 31st, nine articles of the Provisional Regulations for the Recovery of the Shanghai Mixed Court公廨 were finally signed. These regulations are of great historical value and are often used for research by the academic community. They are recorded as follows:

Article 1: (A) The Jiangsu Provincial Government shall change the original Mixed Court會審公廨 in the Shanghai Public Concession to a Provisional Court臨時法庭. Except for cases that fall under the consular jurisdiction of various countries according to treaty條的, all civil and criminal cases within the concession shall be tried by the Provisional Court臨時法庭. (B) All laws (including procedural laws) and regulations that are currently applicable to Chinese courts, as well as laws and regulations formulated and promulgated in the future, shall be applicable to the Provisional Court臨時法庭; provided that the provisions of these regulations and the judicial precedents of the Mixed Court會審公 accepted by future agreements shall be taken into account. (C) All criminal cases directly related to the治安 of the Concession, as well as cases that violate the Yangjingbang Regulations洋涇浜章程 and appendices, and cases in which Chinese people employed by people from countries with consular jurisdiction are criminal defendants, may be observed by a commissioner派委員 appointed by the senior consul. The commissioner shall sit with the judge. Any judgment of the judge shall take effect without the consent of the commissioner; but the commissioner shall have the right to record his dissenting points in detail. Furthermore, without the permission of the Chinese judge, the commissioner shall not question witnesses and defendants. (D) All summonses, arrest warrants, and orders of the court shall take effect upon being signed by the judge. The aforementioned summonses, arrest warrants, and orders shall be numbered and registered by the chief clerk before they are executed. Summonses, arrest warrants, and orders executed in the residences of people from countries with consular jurisdiction shall be signed by the consul of the country concerned or the competent official upon delivery without delay. (E) In civil cases in which people from countries with consular jurisdiction or the Municipal Council are plaintiffs, and in criminal cases in which people from countries with consular jurisdiction are complainants, the consul of the country concerned or the senior consul may send an official to court with the judge in accordance with treaty條的 provisions. (F) A court of appeal上訴庭 shall be established outside the Provisional Court臨時法庭, specializing in criminal appeals directly related to the public security of the concession and criminal appeals in cases involving Chinese and foreigners. The president of the court shall be concurrently held by the president of the Provisional Court臨時法庭. However, cases with a term of imprisonment of five years or less and cases that violate the Yangjingbang Regulations洋涇浜章程 and appendices shall not be appealed. In cases where the senior consul sends a commissioner to observe the initial trial, the senior consul may send another commissioner to observe the appeal, and his powers and appointment procedures shall be the same as those of the commissioner in the initial trial. In criminal appeals in cases involving Chinese and foreigners, the consuls shall send different officials to court in the same manner. (G) The president, judges, and appellate judges of the Provisional Court臨時法庭 shall be appointed by the provincial government.

Article 2: Cases in which the Provisional Court臨時法庭 sentences imprisonment of ten years or more and the death penalty shall be submitted by the court to the provincial government for approval. In cases that are not approved, the provincial government shall notify the court of the reasons for disapproval and re-examine and judge the case, and submit it to the provincial government for further review. Cases in which the death penalty is approved shall be sent to the foreign affairs office of the concession for execution. Inspection matters in the concession shall be carried out by the judge of the Provisional Court臨時法庭 together with the commissioner dispatched by the senior consul.

Article 3: All prisons attached to the Provisional Court臨時法庭, except for civil detention centers and women's prisons, which shall be stipulated separately, shall be managed by officials dispatched by the Municipal Council's Public Works Department. However, all management methods shall be implemented in accordance with the regulations for the management of prisons in China within the scope of feasibility and shall be subject to the supervision of the Provisional Court臨時法庭. The president of the court shall dispatch an inspection team to conduct investigations at any time. A commissioner dispatched by the senior consul shall be added to the team. If there are any deficiencies in the management of prisoners, the court shall be reported immediately, and the Municipal Council shall be ordered to improve the deficiencies immediately. The police department of the Municipal Council shall immediately comply and shall not delay.

Article 4: The summonses, arrest warrants, and orders of the Provisional Court臨時法院 shall be executed by judicial police. These bailiffs shall be selected and dispatched by the police department of the Municipal Council, but shall be directly responsible to the court when performing their duties as bailiffs. All requests or entrustments made by the Provisional Court臨時法庭 to the police department of the Municipal Council shall be actively assisted by the police department of the Municipal Council. Persons arrested by the Municipal Council's police station shall be sent to the Provisional Court臨時法庭 for interrogation within 24 hours, excluding holidays, and shall be released immediately if they are overdue.

Article 5: In civil cases involving Chinese and foreigners in which a consul sends an official to court with the judge, if there is dissatisfaction with the initial judgment, an appeal shall be filed with the Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, and the Special Commissioner shall review the case together with the consul concerned in accordance with treaty條的 provisions, but the original court may be ordered to re-examine the case with a different judge. The official sent by the consul shall also be replaced. If the Special Commissioner and the consul cannot agree on the appeal after the case has been re-examined, the re-examination judgment shall be final.

Article 6: The treasurer and the affairs stipulated by the joint committee of both parties shall be managed by the chief clerk. The chief clerk shall be recommended by the senior consul and appointed by the provincial government upon application by the Provisional Court臨時法庭. He shall be supervised and directed by the president of the Provisional Court臨時法庭, manage the staff, and properly supervise the court's expenses. If the chief clerk is incompetent or derelict in his duties, the president of the Provisional Court臨時法庭 may discipline him, and if necessary, he may be removed with the consent of the senior consul.

Article 7: The above six articles are the provisional regulations for the Jiangsu Provincial Government to recover the Mixed Court會審公廨. The implementation period is three years, calculated from the date of the return of the Mixed Court會審公廨. During this period, the central government may negotiate with the relevant ministers of various countries at any time for a final solution. If the above solution is agreed upon by both parties, these provisional regulations shall be abolished immediately. If there is still no final solution to the negotiations in Beijing after three years, these provisional regulations shall continue to be implemented for another three years, provided that the provincial government may notify and propose amendments six months before the expiration of the first three-year period.

Article 8: At any time in the future, when the Chinese central government negotiates with the governments of various countries to abolish consular jurisdiction, it shall not be bound by any provisions of these provisional regulations.

Article 9: The date of implementation of the measures for the return of the Mixed Court會審公廨 stipulated in these provisional regulations shall be separately determined by the representative of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the senior consul.

On January 1st of the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Mixed Court會審公廨 was officially returned, and the judicial power lost in the concession for more than ten years began to be recovered.

### From Luxury to Education

— Wang Yunwu

(Reprinted from the Hong Kong edition of the newspaper's Sunday Commentary)

Although this article is directed at the Chinese high-level refugees聚居 residing in Hong Kong, the Chinese people in the isolated island of Shanghai and the high-level refugees from various places are also infected with the bad habit of luxury. Therefore, it is worthwhile to reprint it for the general readers.

Yesterday, the newspaper here reported that Mr. Li Meng, a reporter from the French New Europe magazine, made the following statement during an interview with a reporter in Chongqing:

"Two weeks after the fall of Guangzhou, we arrived in Hong Kong. The general Chinese people spent a large amount of money in dance halls, restaurants, and high-end hotels. This abnormal situation can only be described as 'terrible'."

The comment of the word "terrible" here can be said to be very appropriate, and it can also be said to be truly in my heart. (Omission) Why are Chinese people so extravagant, and what methods can be used to get to the root of the problem? Please discuss it briefly.

I believe that the current trend of extravagance in our country is directly or indirectly related to education. On the one hand, the kind of education of being content with poverty and finding joy in the Way, as exemplified in ancient China by eating a basket of food and drinking a ladle of water in a humble alley, has actually long ceased to exist. However, the remaining influence can still control some fame-seeking scholars. But since the opening of the sea ports, a large number of ingenious goods have been imported. The nature of curiosity and beauty comes from talent. The temptation of material things is not easy to resist, and the Western materialism has been introduced into our country one after another, which is enough to promote the desire for material things among the Chinese people. When our country implemented new education, it inherited the Western utilitarianism, but failed to accept its spirit of sacrifice. As a result, we only know how to accumulate wealth but not how to distribute it. Therefore, the trend of luxury and love of goods not only surpasses the past, but also surpasses any other country. On the other hand, most of the school subjects are preparations for coping with the world and finding employment. There is no attention, or very little attention, to the proper entertainment of leisure time. In fact, the working hours of modern occupations are not very long, and those who have received higher education generally have higher positions and shorter working hours. In the 24 hours of a day, 8 hours are for sleep and 8 hours are for work. There are still 8 hours left. In addition to daily life and diet, most of the time is leisure time. If this time is used properly, it will directly benefit the body and mind and indirectly benefit the business. Conversely, it is not only harmful to the body and mind, but also harmful to the business. The reason is that improper entertainment of leisure time not only consumes energy and prevents people from serving earnestly, but also inevitably wastes money. The ancients said, "Insufficiency comes from excess"; and also said, "Only thrift can help integrity." The result of thriftlessness and insufficiency is that few do not damage integrity. Therefore, if the state wants to promote honest politics and the society wants to cultivate an honest atmosphere, it must first vigorously promote thrift. The achievement of the goal of thrift depends on the change of educational policy and the training of proper use of leisure time.

It may be too long to talk about the change of educational policy, so I will discuss it separately. Now I will focus on the aspect of proper use of leisure time. I believe that if you want to make good use of your leisure time, it is better to develop (1) the interest in reading, (2) the interest in sports, or (3) the interest in art during your study period.

The interest in reading has always been the focus of schools; but in reality, most Chinese students abandon books after leaving school. This phenomenon is not only recognized by the general public, but also evidenced by facts. Judging from the business of the publishing industry, the total number in the country for the whole year is only 25 million yuan, which is less than one-tenth of the business of one British and American company in Shanghai. Judging from the number of publications, Japan has a population of less than 90 million, and the total number of ordinary publications newly published in Showa 12 was 31,996. China has a population of no less than 500 million, and the number of new publications in the 25th year of the Republic of China was only 9,438, which is 30% of that of Japan. Also, according to research, the average number of copies printed for each publication in Japan is at least five times that of China. Therefore, in terms of the total number of copies actually printed and sold, the number of new publications in China in one year is only 6% of that of Japan. However, although China's population is more than five times that of Japan, the proportion of people who have received education in the population may only be one-fifth of that of Japan. With this increase and decrease, the number of books purchased by educated people in China is actually equal to 6% of that of Japan. From these two examples, we have to admit that our country's schools have failed greatly in cultivating the interest in reading. The reasons are very complicated; but the tendency of education to be passive and the failure to cultivate students' habit of self-study are the most important factors. The so-called passive tendency refers to the fact that the teaching method of infusion is adopted from elementary school to middle school; the students only study textbooks, the teachers teach it like this, and the students also learn it like this. Over time, they develop a passive habit of relying on the book, and cannot arouse the interest in reading automatically. Even college students should do a lot of automatic research, but one reason is that the habits of elementary and middle schools have gradually become natural, and the other is that the collections of libraries, with very few exceptions, are very short. Therefore, in practice, there is little difference from elementary and middle schools; what they study are only lecture notes, or a very small number of reference books, and the interest in reading is not easy to arouse. Once they leave school, the textbooks and lecture notes are useless, and they rarely read other books. The interest in reading should be cultivated from the beginning; because human nature is curious, reading can satisfy the curiosity. In theory, people who can read all like to read automatically. It is only because the education of elementary and middle schools has gradually become natural over time that it changes to passive. If the proportion of automatic research can be gradually increased in elementary and middle schools according to the students' abilities, especially the work of automatic collection of materials; and the equipment of the libraries of various schools can meet this requirement: then they will definitely be more interested in reading in school, and they will definitely be able to maintain this interest after leaving school.

The interest in sports also comes from birth; because the basis of sports is physical exercise. Try to see that all young children, except those who are sick, are lively and jumping, which is a clear proof that they love sports. Also try to see the crowd and lively situation in the school sports field, which is also a sign of love of sports. But the difference between sports and natural physical exercise is the existence or absence of rules, and the ability of physical exercise to maintain the common interest also depends on the existence of rules. At present, all schools have sports subjects, but only a few students always feel interested when they are in school, and few can maintain this interest after leaving school. The reason may be that there are too many classroom courses, and if you take care of this, you will inevitably lose the other; or because there are too few opportunities to participate, and if you are exposed to it once, you will inevitably be cold ten times. In addition, the purpose of school sports often focuses on trophies, and the facilities are not widespread; therefore, those who are good at sports have no time to read, and those who study seriously have no time to participate in sports; so that sports training that everyone should receive often becomes the profession of a few people, and the result is actually contrary to the original intention of sports. The reason for this is that it is closely related to the physical education methods of the facilities. The most popular sports in schools, such as football and track and field, require larger venues: and football, etc., have restrictions on the number of people, and the level of participants in track and field, etc., cannot be too neat; after this kind of elimination and obstacles, the excellent ones occupy the first place, and the ordinary ones fall behind: the few who occupy the first place become the talents of the trophy, and most of the laggards, in theory, have an urgent need for sports, but they cannot have the opportunity to participate. Therefore, if you want everyone to have an average interest in sports, in addition to the purpose of school sports facilities, the physical education methods adopted must also be adapted to the times. For example, when there is no large venue or no corresponding equipment, it is necessary to change to universal freehand exercises or simple equipment exercises so that everyone has the opportunity to participate. Then, since exercise is based on nature and can be practiced at any time, in other words, in addition to nature, it also increases habit, and its interest will naturally increase and be preserved for a long time.

Art, including sculpture, painting, music, etc., also comes from talent. Try to see that babies fall asleep when they hear singing, and smile when they see red and purple; and also try to see that barbarians can make crude sculptures, paintings and musical instruments, which can all be evidence of talent. Art can not only cultivate temperament, but also enable people's minds to transcend reality. Those who have a certain accomplishment in art will not feel the boredom of leisure; those with a particularly deep accomplishment can often imagine beyond reality and remain calm even when Mount Tai collapses in front of them. In addition to the inherent effect of art, the training of art requires patience, calmness and other characteristics. After these characteristics are formed through this training, they will affect the way of doing things or spending time in leisure. In the curriculum of elementary and middle schools in our country, art subjects are also regarded as compulsory subjects, but in practice, they are often nominal due to the lack of teachers or the emphasis on other courses. In addition, the general school entrance examinations do not pay attention to this; therefore, schools ignore it because its equipment is more difficult, students ignore it because it is not related to further education, and parents ignore it because it does not meet practical needs. The way to improve in the future is to first cultivate a large number of teachers so that there are people to teach; and then stipulate that the entrance examination should be held in the same way as other compulsory subjects; so that it can have the same effect as other compulsory subjects.

The above three kinds of interests can be cultivated during the school period, and only at that time can they be cultivated. It would be great to have all three. I only have one or two of these interests. In addition to being very helpful in doing things and studying, there will be no lack of appropriate ways to spend leisure time, and all kinds of bad habits caused by leisure time can be avoided. The degree of luxury of the Chinese people varies with the degree of education they receive; the higher the degree of education, the higher the degree of luxury: therefore, those who hold more radical views even call it enjoyment-style education; in fact, this is not the fault of a part of education, but the emphasis is on a part of education while ignoring other parts of education. Therefore, the higher the degree of education, the more people know about how to enjoy. Parents, because their positions are higher, have shorter daily working hours and longer leisure hours; and the education they received earlier did not include methods of using leisure time well; therefore, new-style and luxurious enjoyment and entertainment can take advantage of the gap to dominate them, resulting in the disadvantages mentioned in the first paragraph of this article.

### Telegram from Various Groups in Shanghai Supporting the Central Government's Resolution and Deeply Detesting Wang Jingwei's Collaboration with the Enemy and Seeking Peace, Thoroughly Eliminating Those Who Advocate Peace and Undermine Unity

Yesterday, various groups in Shanghai sent a telegram to the Central Government, saying, "President Chiang and all Central Executive Committee members of the Kuomintang Central Committee in Chongqing, be advised: Wang Jingwei's traitorous acts of colluding with the enemy to seek surrender and advocating peace are obvious. The people of the whole country deeply detest them. We, the people of Shanghai, absolutely support the Central Government's resolution and are deeply gratified for the future of the war of resistance. However, in order to eradicate compromise and consolidate unity, we hope that the Central Government can thoroughly eliminate all those who advocate peace and undermine unity, strengthen the mass movement, and reform the administrative structure to rectify discipline and warn others. Sincerely, all groups in Shanghai."

### After Successful Foreign Exchange Control, Improper Application Demand Decreases, Abundant Reserves Consolidate Currency Foundation, Control Aimed at Self-Defense and Stabilization of Currency System

After the National Government implemented foreign exchange control, adopting a system of order approval and special permission for private remittances, the improper demand for foreign exchange has decreased significantly since its implementation. Simultaneously, on the supply side, the method of selling and settling foreign exchange has been adopted, with the proceeds being centrally managed by the Central Bank and Bank of Communications. This has enriched the source of foreign exchange and consolidated the currency foundation. The details are as follows:

After Implementation of Control, Applications Decrease

To safeguard the interests of legitimate merchants and further implement control, a system of order management was promulgated and implemented. For imported goods shipped after January 1, 1938, applications for foreign exchange would be rejected for all items except those approved by the government and holding a certificate. After the implementation of this measure, the application amounts of various banks gradually decreased compared to before. For example, from July 4th to 9th, applications amounted to £1,167,800, with £81,000 approved. From August 1st to 6th, applications amounted to £1,544,800, with £32,646 approved. From September 11th to 17th, applications amounted to £955,590, with £18,144 approved.

Special Approval for Private Remittance Applications

Special approval for private remittances is divided into two categories: (1) remittances for tuition fees for students studying abroad, and (2) remittances for household expenses. The procedures for student remittances follow the regulations of the Executive Yuan, but are subject to strict restrictions. Applicants must have a certificate from the Ministry of Education. For remittances for household expenses, an individual application form for foreign exchange needs must be filled out, stating the purpose and amount, etc. The Central Bank may limit the application amount and grant approval at its discretion during the review. Applications for private foreign exchange needs can only be submitted once a month, during the second week of each month.

Bank Procedures for Customers' Applications

When import merchants need foreign exchange, they should fill out an "Import Goods Foreign Exchange Needs Form." This form has a white background and black characters, divided into four copies: the original, a duplicate, one for the bank's record, and one for the customer's record. The form includes: (1) the name, address, and date of the bank; (2) the name and address of the import company; (3) the tariff number, nature of the goods, quantity, weight, value, country of production, country of export, and date of arrival; (4) the date of foreign exchange needed; (5) the port of import; (6) the country and place to which further transport is required; and (7) the purpose, etc., all of which must be filled out. Then, the customer fills out the attached guarantee, guaranteeing that all the above items are filled out correctly.

Improper Application Demand Decreases

Foreign exchange control has now been declared a success, foiling the "United Reserve Bank" of North China's plan to exchange legal tender for foreign exchange. After its implementation, China's foreign trade has improved, and the amount of import surplus has gradually decreased, allowing the domestic industry to gradually develop. The improper demand for foreign exchange has therefore sharply decreased. After adopting the method of selling and settling foreign exchange, the source of foreign exchange reserves has become abundant, and the currency foundation has become more consolidated. Therefore, China's implementation of control is entirely for self-defense and to stabilize the currency system, and is by no means a symbol of depleted reserves. It is hoped that the people of the country will have this understanding.

### Shanghai-Hangzhou Exchange Increases Amount, Remittances up to 150 Yuan

Since the resumption of Shanghai-Hangzhou exchange in mid-September of last year, the limit was initially only 25 yuan, later increased to 50 yuan. It is now known that the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has received a report from the Hangzhou Post Office of the Zhejiang Postal Administration that the amount for remittances to Hangzhou has been increased to 150 yuan. However, the charging method remains the same, with a remittance fee of one cent per yuan and a supplement fee of one cent, totaling two cents per yuan.

### Fellow Townsmen from Ningbo Retain Yu Jimin, Reply Received

Liu Jianxu agreed to convey the request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government regarding the resignation of Yu Jimin, the director of the Ningbo Police Bureau and commander of the city defense. The Ningbo Association in Shanghai has sent separate telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing, Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province, and Commander Liu of the 3rd Group Army, requesting his retention. It is now known that the association has received a reply telegram from Commander Liu: "Mr. Yu Qiaqing and fellow townsmen, I have received your telegram. All of you care about your hometown and believe that Director Yu Jimin has been in charge of police affairs for a long time and is familiar with the local situation. Your thoughts of retaining him from afar are sincere, and you wish to reverse his decision to resign. I will convey your request to fulfill your wishes. Liu Jianxu, 30th day, secret."

### Japanese Warlords Exhaust Military Strength, Heavy Losses for Navy and Air Force, 1,503 Aircraft, 19 Warships of Various Sizes

According to the French Shanghai Daily, citing a certain foreigner inspecting North China, since the Japanese invasion of China in the autumn of 1937, in addition to heavy losses and casualties in the army, in the air force, the number of aircraft destroyed by the Chinese side by the end of 1938 totaled 1,503. In the navy, as a result of fierce battles on the Yangtze River, a total of 19 warships of various sizes were sunk and destroyed.

### Guerrillas Increasingly Active, Inland Water Transportation Cut Off Again, Two Small Japanese Vessels Intercepted at Qingyang Port

According to the Modern News Agency, the Chinese guerrilla forces have been quite active recently in the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway area and have launched surprise attacks on the railway and important waterways during Japanese transportation, achieving remarkable results. The Japanese have repeatedly suffered heavy losses and are overwhelmed, considering it a great hardship. On New Year's Day, two small Japanese vessels, towing six civilian boats loaded with military supplies and provisions, were surrounded and intercepted by a large guerrilla force in the Qingyang Port area. The Japanese suffered many casualties, and all the ships and cargo were captured by the Chinese army. Only two Japanese merchants and the owner of the vessel escaped and returned to Shanghai. After receiving the report, the Japanese sent 200 soldiers to the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway area yesterday afternoon in an attempt to "encircle and suppress" the guerrillas. At the same time, due to the unrest in various inland waterways, the Japanese strictly ordered all civilian ships to temporarily suspend navigation to prevent attacks. As a result, inland water transportation has been completely cut off again. The business losses suffered by various shipping companies are significant.

Inland River Blockade

According to the Xin Xin News Agency, after the Shanghai Inland Water Shipping Company, a Japanese business, implemented control over inland navigation rights and dispatched ships, guerrilla units in various guerrilla areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have actively started operations. The voyages have been repeatedly detained or attacked, making navigation very difficult. In order to prevent guerrilla activities, the Japanese have implemented a blockade of the inland waterways. Various shipping companies have also suspended operations due to the danger of navigation and the low volume of passengers and cargo. Inland voyages have been completely suspended, and there have been no voyages in recent days.

Passenger and Freight Interruption

According to sources in the inland navigation industry, the activities of inland guerrilla units have been thriving recently, and inland voyages have suffered a great blow. Therefore, ships returning to Shanghai from the inland areas are facing danger along the way, and some waterways have been blockaded, resulting in a large number of ships being stranded in the inland areas, especially in western Zhejiang. Most of them are cargo ships. As a result, passenger and freight transportation to and from the inland areas has completely stopped.

Civilian Navigation Suspended

Before inland navigation was completely suspended, the civilian ship voyages came into being in response to the situation of unrest in the inland areas where there were fewer voyages on major routes. However, recently, due to the blockade of inland waterways, they have also been forced to completely suspend navigation, making transportation to and from the inland areas increasingly difficult. According to the shipping companies, it is necessary to wait for the situation to stabilize somewhat before the waterways can be opened and voyages can be restored.

Suspension of Navigation in Shanghai Suburbs

The number of inland voyages from Shanghai to the suburbs of Shanghai, such as Beixinjing, Minhang, Yexie, Songjiang, Xindai, Chuanlai Temple, Qingpu, Kunshan, Jiaozhi, etc., has always been higher than in other places. Although voyages in various places have been affected by occasional suspensions, the suburbs have still been able to barely maintain them. However, in recent days, guerrilla units have been extremely active in various places in the suburbs, launching attacks from time to time, resulting in the interruption of voyages.

### Newsboys' School Holds New Year's Party, Meeting Held at the YMCA on Sichuan Road Yesterday, Totaling Over Seven Hundred Newsboys

The Shanghai Children's Protection Association and the Newsboys' School jointly organized by this newspaper have been established for half a year. Currently, there are ten schools offering classes, with over five hundred newsboys enrolled. The aim is to integrate education with production and provide vocational guidance to cultivate healthy news vendors and healthy citizens. With the support of the education community and society, the results have been quite satisfactory. On the occasion of the 28th New Year, the school held a New Year's party at the YMCA auditorium on Sichuan Road at 2 p.m. yesterday to promote the spirit of the school and enhance friendship. Attendees included Chen Heqin, Chairman of the Shanghai Children's Protection Association, Mrs. White of the Service Group of the Shanghai International Women's Association, well-known figures from all walks of life such as Cai Renbao, Zhao Zongyu, and over seven hundred newsboys. The details are as follows:

Announcement of the Meeting
When the reporter arrived at the meeting, two newsboys were seen standing on both sides of the gate, providing attentive service. Upon entering the auditorium, all five hundred newsboys were seated in order, wearing the blue cloth uniforms made by this newspaper, simple and neat, which was enough to show the vitality of young children at a time when China was in great difficulty. The symbol on the uniform, shaped like a bell, probably contained the meaning of beating the gong to awaken the deaf and enlighten the blind. The words "Love Yourself, Love Others" were written on it. Their full spirit and strict order were well received by people from all walks of life attending the meeting. The layout of the meeting place was simple and solemn. At 2 p.m. sharp, all the participants had arrived. Their adherence to time and elimination of old habits were also commendable. Then, the meeting was announced to begin, and the national anthem was sung. The emotions of the five hundred newsboys were extremely enthusiastic.

Chen Heqin's Speech
Chairman Chen Heqin delivered a speech, saying that it was the first time for newsboys to gather and socialize during the New Year. The Newsboys' School was founded by the Children's Protection Association, and with the help of Shen Bao, it was able to move forward. There are now ten schools offering classes, and the help given by Shen Bao to the school is not only to ensure that funding is not interrupted, but also to provide spiritual and intellectual support. The Newsboys' School has been running for six months, and the progress has been good. There are more than 2,000 newsboys in Shanghai. While the students have already obtained the opportunity to receive education, there are still 1,500 newsboys who have not yet received education. We hope that all of them will be able to receive education. Today, we are holding this meeting to thank the YMCA for lending the meeting place and to thank the Shen Bao for its encouragement and sponsorship. He hoped that the children would show a new spirit at the beginning of the New Year and be comparable to the American newsboy Edison in the future.

Mrs. White's Speech
After the female students of the Municipal Council Girls' Middle School sang Christmas carols, Mrs. White of the Service Group of the Shanghai International Women's Association gave a speech. Mrs. White brought a generator to the meeting and, in a kind and approachable manner with fluent and tactful words, first invited six newsboys to the stage to test the generator. Then, she delivered a speech, saying that this generator is also the source of the material in today's newspapers. Since you know that I am an American, you should know that this telegraph machine was invented by the American Edison. Mr. Edison's early career was the same as the service you are doing today. He was first a newsboy, then sold newspapers on the train, and then obtained permission from the stationmaster to print newspapers on the train in his spare time to study telephone and telegraph machines. One day, Edison accidentally spilled sulfuric acid on the ground while studying electric machines, causing the superintendent to stop him from printing newspapers on the train. However, Edison did not lose heart because of this and continued his research at home. After several twists and turns, he finally succeeded. His contribution to the world is great. Mrs. White also said that there are many newsboys in the United States who go to school after delivering newspapers, which has become a common phenomenon. As a woman, I would also like to be a newsboy and study. Mrs. White put forward that newsboys should adhere to the following creeds: 1. Study hard; 2. Be honest; 3. Help others, and wished them to work hard for the country.

Cai Renbao's Speech
Cai Renbao said in his speech that Shen Bao has a popular weekly that can be read by people with limited knowledge, which is of great benefit. Newspapers are a public instrument of society and should aim to benefit society. The newspaper's arguments and records benefit society. The attitude of you newsboys in selling newspapers must focus on honesty. Zhao Zongyu said in his speech that Shen Bao's sponsorship of the Newsboys' School is by no means out of pity for you or for relief, but because you are young and promising, and you are very lovable. If you can study, you should work hard and be polite in your service, and cultivate both your virtues and careers. From being lovable today to being respectable in the future, this is the small meaning of Shen Bao's sponsorship of the Newsboys' School. He also used a diamond as a metaphor, hoping that the newsboys would have a persevering will and a spirit that does not avoid wind and frost. He also used a magnet as a metaphor, hoping that the 500 newsboys who are enrolled can set an example and arouse the sympathy of all sectors of society, and that they will cooperate and sponsor the more than 1,000 newsboys who have not yet enrolled, so that they can also have the opportunity to study. Then, he distributed the prepared candy to all the newsboys, and the principal of the Newsboys' School gave a training speech to encourage them.

Donations and Entertainment
Following this, students from the ten schools of the Newsboys' School held a disaster relief donation event, with each school donating more than ten yuan or five or six yuan, all of which were earned by the newsboys through hard work. Cai Renbao, representing the Relief Association, accepted the donations and expressed his thanks, saying that this was enough to show the newsboys' nature of loving themselves and loving others. Then, the entertainment began, with a total of more than 20 programs, including singing, Peking opera, and magic, which lasted until night. The reporter also talked briefly with the newsboys, who said that the current training goals of the school are divided into: 1. Family visits; 2. Love yourself, love others; 3. Central training; 4. Vocational guidance, and that extracurricular activities such as speech contests are also emphasized. They expressed their pleasant emotions of serving and studying at the same time.

### Citizens' Fundraising Committee Continues to Promote Fundraising, Broadcasting Ends, Thanks to All Parties, Flower Community Raises 15,000 Yuan

The Citizens' Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held a broadcasting fundraising event to raise money to support refugees. The event has ended on schedule. The General Assembly thanked all parties and the fundraising teams of the association will continue to fundraise from now on to promote fundraising work. The details are recorded separately as follows:

Continue to Promote
In order to continue to promote the fundraising and support work, the association has sent the support certificates to the leaders of each fundraising team and asked them to start promoting fundraising from now on. The association also appealed to all sectors of society to continue to support, saying that the association's fundraising campaign to support refugees is currently continuing. It is hoped that all women who have not yet supported will continue to support, and those who have already supported will persuade their relatives and friends to support, and participate together to complete the good deeds. The support certificates can be obtained at the office, 414 Xingye Building, Jiangxi Road, Beijing Road, telephone 18533.

Thanks to All Parties
The association's broadcasting fundraising event has ended, and it specially thanks all parties. In order to promote the movement to support refugees, the association held a broadcasting fundraising event. It was honored by the joint broadcast by all the major radio stations in the city, the Hakka guest programs of each radio station, the donation of advertisements by major merchants, and the unanimous participation of the city's entertainment industry, film industry, famous singers, and famous actors in the special broadcasting programs. The gesture of joining hands to benefit the victims of the disaster is admired and inexplicable, and it is specially advertised in the newspaper to express gratitude and to promote benevolence. All the detailed numbers of the generous donations from benefactors from all walks of life will be reported daily by the Daya Radio Station from today onwards (reporting time is from 10:20 to 11:00 in the morning, and from 11:40 to 12:20 in the afternoon). It will be notified again after the statistics are completed. During the period of the General Assembly, due to the heavy workload, there may be some inadequacies in the reception and other aspects, and it is hoped that you will understand.

Wang Wanbai's Speech
Dr. Wang Wanbai, Chairman of the Broadcasting Industry Association, delivered a speech at the Sino-Western Radio Station last night at the invitation of the Broadcasting Fundraising Conference, saying that today is the last day of the broadcasting fundraising. Thanks to the advocacy of the Relief Association, the efforts of the broadcasters, and the enthusiasm of the benefactors, the results have been excellent. Although I am representing the radio station, all the radio stations are only providing material support. All the planning of the affairs and the troubles of income and expenditure are undertaken by the citizens' group of the association. I feel very tired. As for the donation report, the broadcasting is hasty, and there may be some mistakes. I talked with Mr. Lin Kanghou, and he said that the funds raised jointly by the radio stations will be reported in detail in the future. The work in the meeting is serious, and it is worthy of admiration. The benefactors are generous in their donations and enthusiastic in their relief efforts. Of course, they have nothing to ask for, but according to the experience of religion, those who help others will surely be helped by God, and the return of rewards will come naturally. The Christian Bible says that even giving a cup of cold water to a little boy, God will not forget it. As for the amount of donation, please do what you can, because people look at how much is donated, but God looks at how much is left. In short, donating money to help others is a right, not an obligation. The Bible says, "It is more blessed to give than to receive." Please do not miss this last opportunity for good fortune.

### US Films Uninspected Telegrams, Japan Protests

The Japanese side alleges that the US Global Wireless Radio Company has been filming uninspected telegrams to the United States in the Public Concession for nearly six months. Japan has recently protested to the US President.

### Jewish Refugees Flock to Shanghai, Many are Artists, Journalists, etc., Raising Funds to Publish Newspapers, Arrange Jobs

According to a fast news agency report from this port, a large number of Jewish refugees arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Conte Rosso ship arrived in Shanghai, originally said to carry only 240 people, but actually carried 290 people. Also, the Potsdam ship was originally said to carry only 60 people, but in fact increased to 128 people. The Shanghai German-Austrian Jewish Refugee Relief Committee said that due to the continuous arrival of Jewish refugees, the number has reached 1,400 by yesterday, and it is difficult to settle them. They are now discussing the establishment of a large-scale reception center in Hongkou. The first reception center will be set up in the Chinese Primary School of the Municipal Council on Huade Road, and it is planned to renovate the school building to accommodate 1,400 people, and then increase it to 2,000 people. To facilitate Jewish refugees, a German newspaper will be published from December 31. The newspaper is not an organ against the National Socialist Party or anti-Hitler, but purely serves Jewish refugees and helps them find jobs. It is reported that many of the Jewish refugees who have arrived in Shanghai are poets, writers, journalists, musicians, and workers.

### Chinese Philanthropic Children's Association Distributes Winter Clothing to Refugee Children

The Shanghai office of the Chinese Philanthropic Children's Association has been distributing winter clothing to refugee children since New Year's Day. Today is the third day. From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., the distribution of winter clothing will continue at the Huangjia Ku Garden, No. 33 Kade Road, at the Civilian Education Institute. Each set of winter clothing has an inscription that reads, "People help me, and I must help others." As for infant refugees, they can be brought by their families with vouchers to receive clothing. This year, street refugees will be given clothing for a total of four days. Tomorrow is the fourth day, and the distribution will continue at the Philanthropic Education Institute at No. 1231 Lafayette Road, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. It is reported that this year, with donations of more than 12,000 yuan, more than 10,000 sets of winter clothing for refugee children have been made. Among them, 6,000 sets are prepared for street refugee children, and more than 4,000 sets are prepared for refugee children in shelters. Each set of winter clothing includes one padded jacket and one pair of padded pants, which originally cost more than two yuan. However, due to the enthusiastic donation of more than 100 dan of high-quality cotton by many cotton merchants, such as Zhiyi Hao and Tongcheng Hao, the actual cost per set is only 1.2 yuan. This shows the society's love and consideration for the refugee children.

### Ministry of Finance Approves Three-Month Extension for the Recall of Old Notes from the Former Yunnan Provincial Bank Expired at the End of February The Fuxin Bank Has Been Ordered to Comply

The Ministry of Finance, regarding the old American-printed banknotes issued by the former Yunnan Provincial Fumin Bank, had properly established a recall and destruction plan, limiting the recall to be completed from September 1 to the end of November last year. An order was issued to comply with the plan to facilitate the closure. The deadline has now passed, and the recall should have ended. However, due to inconvenient transportation in the province and remote provinces, not all banknotes have been recalled. Repeated requests have been made for an extension. Considering the actual situation and to ease the people's hardships, a three-month extension has been specially approved, from December 1 last year to the end of February of the 28th year [1939]. During this extension period, old Fumin Bank banknotes circulating in various counties and cities of the province should be exchanged at exchange institutions or registered for exchange at local chambers of commerce. Once the period expires, the Fuxin Bank will be ordered to handle the closure and no further extension will be granted. The bank has reportedly been ordered to comply, and the provincial government has issued a notice to all sectors of society to comply accordingly.

### Charitable Lottery Distribution Committee Distributes Fourth Installment of Prize Money

Still being organized... The fourth installment of the French Concession Refugee Relief Charitable Lottery will be announced soon. After the fourth installment of the lottery was drawn on December 8th of last year, the winning prize money has been claimed one after another. It is now known that the lottery relief fund distribution committee recently held a meeting to distribute the fourth installment of prize money. Those who attended included Father Rault, Feng Zhenduo, Chasber, Li Guiyong, Patenotre, Pullen, Yan Huiqing, An Xianjin, Jones, McNorton, and Pathetot. The meeting was chaired by Father Rault to discuss the method of distributing the fourth installment of refugee relief prize money. It is reported that the amount of distribution has not yet been organized on the same day, and will be announced soon.

### Failure of the Pseudo "City Bank" Organization Japanese Side Refuses to Invest Activities Have Ceased

Modern News reports that after the pseudo "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan took office, in an attempt to control finance, Zhou Wenrui, Zhu Manqing, and others prepared to organize a pseudo "Shanghai City Bank" and proceeded very actively. They set up an office in a villa on Jessfield Road, appointing Gu Disan as "President" and Fu Pinggui and others as "Managers." The capital was set at 10 million yuan, and operations would begin after half of the amount was collected. It is now known that this plan, after several months of preparation, has been declared a failure. Initially, the Japanese side had promised to invest 2.5 million yuan, but suddenly went back on their word and have not provided a penny of assistance, which greatly affected the progress of the "City Bank." The "Pseudo Government" is very short of funds and has no surplus funds to allocate. Therefore, the "Pseudo Mayor" had another whimsical idea. Because the former "Dadao Municipal Government Supervision Office" had transferred 1 million yuan in tax revenue and deposited it in the Japanese Zhengjin Bank, which had not been used, he requested the Japanese side to allow the withdrawal of this deposit to be used for the organization of the pseudo "City Bank." Unexpectedly, he was again sternly rejected by the Japanese side, who did not allow any amount to be moved. Therefore, the attempt to establish the pseudo "City Bank" has been declared a complete failure and cannot be prepared. Therefore, the office has recently fallen into a state of stagnation.

### Second Batch of Public Comfort Mission About to Depart to Comfort the Soldiers on the Front Lines in South China

Various public organizations in Shanghai have voluntarily organized comfort missions to comfort the soldiers fighting on the front lines. The first group of people to depart is about to go to the Northwest. It is now known that the second comfort mission, a group of more than ten people, is ready and will take a boat to Hong Kong in the coming days, and then go to the front lines of our army in South China, representing the people of Shanghai to comfort the soldiers fighting the war. The trip is scheduled for two months. The frost on the roof tiles is very thick.

### The Weather in This City is Cold Again The Frost on the Roof Tiles is Very Thick

The weather in this city turned cold again yesterday. In the morning, the frost on the roof tiles was very thick, like a pile of thin snow. The sky was also overcast, and the north wind was blowing tightly. The temperature dropped quite drastically compared to yesterday.

### Armed Japanese Patrol on Nanjing Road Early on New Year's Day

Early on New Year's Day, the Lao Zha Police Station received a report that three Japanese soldiers were patrolling Nanjing Road, each carrying a pistol. A foreigner reported to the police station that at 3:30 in the morning, he had witnessed three Japanese patrol soldiers walking at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road. The police station immediately dispatched detectives to investigate, but they had already disappeared. However, no unfortunate incident occurred.

### The Situation in the Four Suburbs of Shanghai is Depressed Traffic on the Huangpu River Resumes The Area South of the Huangpu Remains Blockaded

During the Gregorian New Year, the situation in the suburbs of Shanghai became tense. Security in various districts was tightened, and most of the water and land transportation was suspended. Traffic on the Huangpu River resumed yesterday, while ferries west of the Huangpu River were suspended. The details are as follows:

Suburbs

In the past few days, the guerrilla forces scattered in the suburbs of Shanghai have become active again, especially in the areas south and west of the Huangpu River. They launch surprise attacks from time to time, so various districts have tightened security and advanced the curfew time. Residents are uneasy and rarely go out. After 5 p.m., there are no pedestrians, and the situation is quite depressed.

Huangpu River

Traffic on the Huangpu River was completely suspended on the Gregorian New Year's Day due to the closure of all ferry crossings. Yesterday, it was reopened. The Donggou, Gaoqiao, and Gaomiao ferry crossings resumed normal operations. The ferry from the South Pier of the Huangpu River to Zhoujiadu also resumed at the same time. Because of the one-day blockade, there were many passengers.

South of the Huangpu

The situation south of the Huangpu River is quite tense because the guerrilla forces scattered there are very active. All ferry crossings such as Desheng Port, Yangsi Bridge, Wangjia Ferry, Dujia Xing, Zhagang, Guangang, Tangkou, and Lutan Temple are completely blockaded. Passengers traveling to and from the Huangpu River have to detour through Pudong, but the inspection along the way is very strict.

West of the Huangpu

Currently, the only land route between the concession and the west of Shanghai is Hongqiao Daxi Road. The only waterway is the direct ferry to Beixinjing. Recently, due to the unstable situation in the area, the ferry between Beixinjing and the concession has been suspended. Security has also been tightened at key land points, and inspections are very strict. Therefore, there are very few pedestrians. All key transportation points between the west of Shanghai and the south of the city are also blockaded, prohibiting pedestrian traffic.

### The War in Haimen, Qidong, and Nantong Has Stopped Foreign Ships to Sail Today

In order to seize the tax revenue along the Yangtze River estuary, the Japanese side mobilized troops and used naval, land, and air forces to oppress the Chinese army in Haimen and Qidong in northern Jiangsu at the end of last year. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle. After the Chinese army fought bravely, they retreated to Nantong and the San Chang to hold their ground. Various foreign ships have resumed sailing, but cargo transportation has been sharply reduced. The details are as follows:

Japanese Troops Withdraw

Five or six thousand Japanese and puppet troops began to invade Haimen and Qidong in northern Jiangsu on December 22 last year. At that time, the Chinese army was under heavy pressure from the Japanese side's five-pronged attack. In order to preserve their strength, they retreated to the interior. Some units of the Chinese army suffered heavy casualties. Later, after the brave counterattack by the elite troops of the 9th and 10th Regiments of the 5th Brigade of the 4th Guerrilla Zone of the 24th Army Group, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. Therefore, they retreated back to Nantong City and the Qinglong Port Dasheng San Chang and other places to hold their ground. This time, the Japanese army spent a lot of troops and ammunition, but gained nothing. They showed their desperation and only made themselves worse.

The War is Pacified

The Japanese and puppet troops in Haimen have been deeply confined since retreating to the San Chang. They have built fortifications around them to prevent attacks by the Chinese army and dare not go out to cause trouble. The war in northern Jiangsu can be temporarily considered pacified. The ports along the Yangtze River, such as Songji Port, Niugang, Shuji Port, Lao Hong Port, Xin Port, Lingdian Port, and the Sanhe Port Dongyi Hao in Qidong, are still garrisoned by the Chinese army. However, the curfew is stricter at night. They hide in the countryside during the day, and local order is stable. Foreign ships are scheduled to sail as usual on January 3. However, passenger and cargo traffic will probably not recover in the short term.

### Guerrilla Team Intercepts Japanese Soldiers in Huacao Kills Two Japanese Soldiers Seizes Three Rifles

The guerrilla teams in the Hongqiao Airport area in western Shanghai have been exceptionally active recently. The day before yesterday morning, Yao, the captain of the brigade, led more than 30 guerrillas to inspect Zhuzhai Town. On the way through Huacao Town, they suddenly encountered Japanese soldiers stationed in the town. The guerrillas intercepted them. The gunfire erupted, and bullets rained down. The villagers were panicked and fled in all directions. After about two hours, the Japanese soldiers were unable to resist and collapsed. Two Japanese soldiers were killed, and two Type 38 rifles were captured. It is reported that several guerrillas were also injured.

### Guerrilla Team in Pudong Strengthens Political Work

After the large-scale invasion by the Japanese army in the Fengnanchuan One Two County Guerrilla Zone in Pudong last month, a fierce battle broke out. Because the Chinese army used the terrain to lure the enemy deep, the county seat of Fengnan was once occupied by the Japanese army. Later, because the Chinese side harassed them day and night with guerrilla tactics, the Japanese army did not dare to linger and hurriedly retreated to their original defense line, that is, the Chuansha area retreated to Chuansha County, the Nanhui area retreated to Zhoupu, and the Fengxian area was completely abandoned. The situation in the three counties has been restored to the situation before the 12th and 13th. However, after this battle, the Japanese army's capabilities have become clear, and the method of resistance should also be changed accordingly. Grasping the enemy's weaknesses (that is, the tactic of breaking them one by one, concentrating a small number of troops to attack a certain guerrilla base), and engaging in self-improvement, there have been significant changes in terms of equipment, organization, ideology, and action. It is necessary to launch operations simultaneously from several aspects in the future to disperse the Japanese army's strength, and to implement emergency blockade methods in the waterways to prevent Japanese speedboats from operating. In terms of local administration, the principle of not disturbing the people will also be strictly implemented. The county government will directly manage the army's salaries and provide them directly. On the one hand, the work of eradicating traitors will be intensified to make the Japanese army lose their eyes and ears and fall into a state of blind action. Therefore, a new situation will unfold in the future of Greater Pudong.

### Puppets Collude with the Japanese Form Parties and Pursue Private Interests The So-called Advisory Group is Also Divided into Two Factions

Nishimura, the chief of the Japanese guidance group in the pseudo "Municipal Government," and instructors Kai Kojima and others were dismissed and investigated by the Japanese side for a large-scale smuggling case. Another instructor, Yakudai, was also arrested on suspicion of stealing warehouse goods. Therefore, the Nishimura guidance team was affected by the scandalous incident and disintegrated. The pseudo "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan, in order to facilitate his own arbitrary private interests, took the opportunity to try to get rid of the constraints and pleaded with the pseudo "President of the Executive Yuan" Liang Hongzhi to consult with the Japanese side to cancel the instructor system. However, the Japanese side refused. However, as a result of consultations, the name of the instructor was changed to advisor, and two Japanese people, Ishii and Nishida, were appointed to reorganize the "guidance team" into an "advisory group." Ishii is a close figure to Fu Xiaoan and serves as the chief advisor to the pseudo "Municipal Government." Nishida is close to Su Xiewen and serves as an advisor to the pseudo "Municipal Government." Therefore, the advisory group is divided into the Fu and Su factions. The advisors of other pseudo "bureaus" will also be generated from these two factions. Therefore, the pseudo "government" will be handled by two factions in opposition to each other, monitoring each other. The nature is different from the era of the previous guidance team. The lack of unity in the Japanese and puppet affairs is evident. However, under the circumstances of different backgrounds, it will be more difficult for Fu and Su to cooperate in handling pseudo "politics." Therefore, the number of conflicts will inevitably be greater than before.

### National Government Orders Factories Near War Zones to Register and Move Inland Those Unable to Move Can Have Transportation Costs Provided National Government Subsidizes Production Through Economic Ministry

In order to adapt to the needs of the war of resistance, in addition to encouraging various domestic goods factories to produce domestic goods as much as possible, the National Government has also ordered local governments in various provinces to assist factories in moving inland in order to support them and facilitate their development. It is now known that since the outbreak of the war of resistance the year before last, hundreds of factories in the southeastern provinces have either moved to the Shanghai Concession to start work or moved to the interior after the National Army withdrew westward due to the war. There were also not a few who could not move due to environmental constraints at the time. In view of this, the government recently reordered the factories in various places near the war zone to be actively registered by the provincial governments and to find ways to move inland. If the factory itself is unable to move, the local government will raise transportation costs or estimate and buy the factory, and then transport the machinery to the interior. The government authorities also made a decision to subsidize inland factories that are smaller in scale with funds from the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the construction departments of various provinces to revitalize industry and increase production. The measures have been finalized and a notice has been sent to various provinces to comply.

### Low Water Level in Inner Harbor in Winter Reduced Rice Shipments to Shanghai Only 5,000 Bags Shipped to Shanghai Per Day Sufficient Rice Reserves in Shanghai, No Worry for Civilian Consumption

Since the beginning of winter, the water level in the inner harbor has been low, and navigation has been difficult. Therefore, rice shipments to Shanghai from the interior have been reduced to only about 5,000 bags per day. Shanghai's rice reserves have reached more than 600,000 bags, which is sufficient to maintain civilian consumption for three to four months. The price of rice is stable, and people's minds are at ease. The silver and money industry has properly arranged for the rice storage problem and is storing as much as possible. The details are as follows:

Reduced Source

Usually during the winter season, the tides have receded, and the water level of rivers is low. However, in recent years, due to the war, the tributaries and rivers in the interior have not been dredged, so the mud beds have increased, making it difficult for heavy sailing ships to navigate. The water level of the Yangtze River has also decreased, making it difficult for larger tonnage ships to approach ports. Due to these various reasons, rice shipments to Shanghai have been very scarce recently. Currently, only about 5,000 bags of rice are shipped to Shanghai every night from various ports and inland rivers, which is more than half less than one or two days ago.

No Worries about Civilian Consumption

Reporters from Modern News investigated the total amount of rice stored in the city and estimated that it reached 634,000 bags. This batch of rice is estimated to be able to maintain civilian consumption for three to four months. The price of rice in Shanghai has been stable since the end of the Gregorian calendar year. The highest quality white japonica rice sells for 12.23 yuan per stone, while the middle and second grades are between 10.45 and 11.12 yuan. As for rice exports, in addition to the more than 100,000 bags smuggled by the Japanese side (this item of rice is purchased from the interior and transported there), the number of Shanghai rice transshipped is still limited.

Rent a House to Store Rice

Regarding the previous shortage of warehouses for rice storage in Shanghai, rice merchants actively negotiated with the concession authorities and related organizations. It is now known that the silver and money industry will store as much domestic rice as possible in its original warehouses, and the warehousing fees are also particularly favorable. At the same time, rice merchants are also finding their own ways to rent vacant houses for storage. Therefore, the problem of storing the river rice from the interior has been resolved. If it is still not enough, the concession authorities will assist in properly arranging remedies.

### Polish Meat Exports Sales Widest in the United Kingdom

Polish news: Poland's main exports are coal, timber, sugar, salt, iron, agricultural products, textiles, and meat. In terms of meat, a large amount is exported every year, all of which are shipped to countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. In the first three quarters of 1938, Poland exported a total of 136,000,000 zlotys worth of live pigs and meat. The amount for the same period in 1937 was 124.3 million zlotys. The largest increase was in veal and dried beef. The export volume of live pigs and pork did not increase or decrease. In terms of the export of live pigs and pork, 308,721 pigs were exported in the first three quarters of 1938, of which 123,217 were shipped to the United Kingdom, 102,870 to Germany, and 71,749 to the United States. In 1937, exports of live pigs and pork accounted for 24.4 percent of the total meat exports. In 1938, it accounted for 33.3 percent of total meat exports.

### Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economic Affairs Establish a General Office for Import and Export of Products in Zhejiang Branches Established in Various Ports in Eastern Zhejiang Fully Established in Mid-Month

Since the coastal ports of South China were blockaded due to the war, most of the domestic products are now exported through Wenzhou and Taizhou in eastern Zhejiang. As a result, the import and export trade in eastern Zhejiang has suddenly become prosperous after the war. The sharp increase in tax revenue at the Ouhai Customs and the Yonghai Customs is also unprecedented. At the same time, the import of smuggled goods is also being discovered every day. It is now known that in order to prevent the smuggling of smuggled goods, in addition to stepping up anti-smuggling work, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have now sent personnel to join the Zhejiang Provincial Wartime Product Adjustment Office to organize a national product import and export general office in eastern Zhejiang to handle the overall control, investigation, audit, inspection, inspection, and release work, in order to avoid the import and export of smuggled goods and enrich tax revenue. It is reported that the general office will establish branches in various coastal ports in eastern Zhejiang to effectively implement the work. It is expected to be fully established in mid-month.

### Shanghai Post Office Sufficient Stamp Storage The Situation of the Peiping Printing Bureau is Unknown Already Printed Stamps are Sufficient for Several Years

Since the Shanghai Postal Administration received four types of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's third edition stamps bearing the late leader's portrait from the Directorate General of Posts at the end of October last year, the fractional Dr. Sun Yat-sen's stamps of the same edition that are convenient for ordinary use have not continued to arrive. It is thought that they are still being engraved and printed in Hong Kong. Most of the various current stamps sold by the Shanghai Post Office have always been printed by the Peiping Printing Bureau. Since the Huaibei [North China] bandits have been leaping around and the situation is very different, the situation of the Printing Bureau is quite unclear. Therefore, there are doubts about the issue of printing stamps. According to news from the Shanghai Postal Administration, before the Lugouqiao [Marco Polo Bridge] Incident the year before last, the Directorate General of Posts knew that the situation in the north was unstable. Therefore, it transported as many stamps printed by the Peiping Printing Bureau to the interior as possible. Shanghai also received a lot, so there is no fear of panic in the next few years.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Direct Flight Resumption Awaits Approval From Military Affairs Commission

Regarding the issue of resuming direct flights on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, after the Ningbo Garrison Command was ordered to prohibit it, all passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo had to detour through Wenzhou and Taizhou, which was inconvenient for all parties. A joint report was submitted to the Military Affairs Commission and the Commander-in-Chief of the × Army Group, requesting leniency and reopening. The case was passed by the Jinhua Navigation Affairs Conference on the 27th of last month, and the opinion was signed and submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for approval. The reporter from Modern News inquired with a giant in the shipping industry yesterday, who replied that the case has not yet been formally approved by the Military Affairs Commission. However, a private telegram from Chongqing said that there is hope for resuming direct flights. Once approved, it can be realized. The report in yesterday's newspaper that the authorities had rejected the request due to defense reasons was inaccurate.

Two Ships to Arrive in Shanghai Today and Tomorrow

The British Kaibo, chartered by the Ningshao Shipping Company, has been approved to sail to Ningbo to load cargo and has sailed many times. The company received a telegram from Ningbo yesterday stating that the ship had left Ningbo yesterday after loading cargo and sailed directly to Shanghai. It will arrive in port this morning. The Meifu, of Jardine Matheson, will also depart from Ningbo and sail directly to Shanghai today or tomorrow, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai the day after tomorrow. After the two ships unload their cargo in Shanghai, they will continue to sail to Xiaowan and Ningbo. At present, most of the bulk cargo between Shanghai and Ningbo relies on these two ships for transportation, so freight is extremely crowded.

Shanghai-Ningbo Joint Transport of Passengers and Cargo

After the Tangsai, which runs on the Ningbo-Taiwan line, and the Tangbei, which runs on the Shanghai-Taiwan line, both of Huamei Company, implemented the joint transportation of goods, all goods loaded in Shanghai and shipped to Ningbo can be transferred to Tangsai to be shipped to Ningbo upon arrival in Taiwan with a single ticket after paying all the freight at once. In addition, the Meida, which runs the Ningbo line of the Meili Company, was originally scheduled to be jointly transported with the Meifa of the company, but because Meifa was approved to sail to Wenzhou, it was changed to be jointly transported with Haifu Hana Mountain Thai and other ships. Before the restoration of direct navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo, the general passengers recognized that this method was quite convenient.

### Loading and Unloading Goods in Front of Shops Do Not Impose Fines Lightly to Alleviate Merchants' Difficulties While Not Obstructing Traffic

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Chengdu Road Police Station yesterday, saying: We are writing to you that, according to a letter from Yushang Yiji Candle Shop, a member of the 12th District Branch of our association, stating that our shop is located at No. 6 Tongfu Road. This morning (December 27), a special police officer came to inquire, saying that our shop had piled sandalwood on the cement pavement for an hour yesterday, and did not listen to the Chinese police's warnings, which violated police regulations and awaited punishment. After investigation, our shop did indeed add sandalwood yesterday, and it was unloaded from the car, moved to the shop through the cement pavement, and piled up. The distance was very close, and the time taken should not be too long. It was indeed the police deliberately demanding and seriously reporting the matter. Now that shops are stocking up, there is a daily inventory. If you are punished in this way, it will happen every day. I would like to ask your association to protect the merchants and think about the situation of the merchants, and quickly send a letter to the police station, asking them to consider the difficulties of the merchants and allow leniency in the future if various shops have goods to be loaded and unloaded within the scope of not hindering traffic, in order to maintain commerce. The association asks that the police station show some leniency and waive the fines if the traffic is not hindered, in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties.

### Ningbo Fellow Association Asks to Restrict All Ships Coordinate and Adjust Shipping on Eastern Zhejiang Line

The Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai believes that it has been very inconvenient for people traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo recently, and the cost of ships is exorbitant, which is beyond the means of ordinary people. The association recently sent a telegram to the Zhejiang authorities, asking for restrictions to be added. At the same time, the ships sailing on the eastern Zhejiang route are mostly very small and difficult to withstand wind and waves. Therefore, they should also be screened and adjusted to ensure the safety of travelers.

### German Shipping Restores Zhangjiagang Line

The Shanghai-Taiziwei Port route was affected by the bombing of the port by Japanese warships, and the flights were suspended, causing difficulties for the transport of passengers and goods between Shanghai and the interior. In order to clear passengers and goods in the interior, the foreign shipping industry is planning to restore the Jiangyin Zhangjiagang route. The German Luan and other ships have scheduled to resume service on the 3rd. Mota and other shipping companies will also send ships to join the service, which will solve the problem of passenger and freight transportation between Shanghai and the interior.

### Manager and Business Director Cross-Accusation Case: Initial Trial Found Not Guilty, Both Appealed; Higher Third Branch Court Sets Hearing Date Based on Submissions

The agent of Zhen Feng Qin Ji Sugar Firm on Lao Yong'an Street in the French Concession filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing Mei Shaoxiong, a Cantonese man who was the firm's business director for Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, of breach of trust. He claimed that Mei Shaoxiong secretly obstructed Hakka merchants from paying debts totaling 700,000 to 800,000 gold dollars, affecting the firm's business. The complaint requested an investigation. Mei Shaoxiong hired lawyer Ge Zhiqin to defend him and filed a counter-suit for false accusation. The initial trial found both parties not guilty. Dissatisfied with the verdict, both parties appealed to the Criminal Division of the Higher Third Branch Court. He Jingtian of Zheng Feng Sugar Firm cited three points in his appeal, stating that the original trial did not thoroughly investigate and audit the accounts. He requested the Higher Third Branch Court to conduct a detailed examination, overturn the original verdict, and punish the appellee Mei Shaoxiong according to Article 342 of the Criminal Law. Based on the submission, the Higher Third Branch Court held two hearings, but no conclusion was reached. Recently, another hearing was scheduled. However, the appellee Mei Shaoxiong requested a postponement, and only the appellant He Jingtian, accompanied by his lawyer Mao Hanshen, appeared in court. The court announced that the hearing would be rescheduled.

### Forging Gold Rubles: Principal Culprit Arrested; Deceived Pawnshops in Both Concessions

Levitoff (transliteration), a 34-year-old Lithuanian residing on Huanlong Road in the French Concession, from October of last year, forged Russian rubles using lead and wrapping them in gold foil. He pawned them at various pawnshops in the British and French concessions, receiving over 30 French francs per coin. Sixteen pawnshops, including those at 115 Rue Notre Dame, 7 Route P. Henry, and 13 Route Bayle in the French Concession, were deceived. The French police discovered the fraud and dispatched detectives to arrest Levitoff, who was apprehended on December 24th of last year. According to his confession, he attempted to pawn the forged rubles at thirty pawnshops within the French Concession and several dozen pawnshops in the International Settlement. After investigation confirmed the facts, the French police transferred the defendant to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, requesting detention pending further investigation and prosecution. After a brief interrogation by Judge Shang, the hearing was adjourned for a week for further investigation, and the defendant was detained.

### Fellow Provincials Organize Fundraising Committee: Establishment Meeting Scheduled; Set for January 7th Afternoon; To Be Held at the Bankers' Association

The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Provincial Fellowship Fundraising Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM.

### Pan Yougao and Others: Convicted of Forgery

Pan Yougao, an employee of the Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association, previously colluded with silk and satin shop owners and brokers Ma Yuliang, Luo Dayuan, Qian Jianhua, Wu Minbo, Li Fengzhi, Jiang Youjia, and Hu Jianao to forge the private seal of Pan Yisheng, a standing committee member of the association, and issued tax-exempt export certificates. Li Zhishan, a lawyer for the Public Works Department, filed a lawsuit with the Special First Court on the charge of forgery. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, Tang Mingshi, and Le Junwei to defend them. After interrogation, Judge Feng Shide of the First Criminal Division pronounced the verdict yesterday: Pan Yougao was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, commutable to a fine of two yuan per day, with a two-year suspended sentence. Luo Dayuan was sentenced to three months of imprisonment, commutable to a fine of two yuan per day. Qian Jianhua, Wu Minbo, Ma Yuliang, and Li Fengzhi were each fined 300 yuan. Jiang Youjia and Hu Jianao were each fined 120 yuan as a warning.

### Zhen Feng Factory Owner Tang Bushan and Others: Accused of Embezzlement and Breach of Trust

Pan Housheng, a Ningbo native and owner of the Huacheng Yarn Factory at 22 Yuanmao Lane, west of Tiantong Road on North Zhejiang Road, recently hired lawyer Chen Wencan to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, accusing Tang Bushan, Tang Bulin, and Tang Bugao, the owners of the Zhen Feng Factory at 81, Lane 714, Xiaoshadu Road, Singapore Road, and Hao Jinsheng, an accessory civil defendant, of embezzlement and breach of trust. The indictment stated that in July of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the plaintiff, with Hao Jinsheng as guarantor, provided yarn to the Zhen Feng Factory, owned by the defendants Tang Bushan, Tang Bulin, and Tang Bugao, for processing and weaving cloth, with written evidence and a guarantee bond. However, the defendants Tang Bushan and others often delayed delivering the cloth made from the yarn provided by the plaintiff. Suspecting something amiss, the plaintiff investigated and discovered that the defendants had secretly sold the yarn provided by the plaintiff to Shen Sheng in Pudong for a sum of 1,000 taels. Furthermore, six pieces of pile wool and one piece of flannel that had been woven were pawned at the Zhenlong Pawnshop on Changping Road, Xiaoshadu Road, and the plaintiff redeemed them last month by paying the pawn price. The defendants Tang Bushan, Tang Bulin, and Tang Bugao were contractors for the plaintiff for processing and weaving cloth, but they violated their duties and, with the intention of appropriating the property, damaged the plaintiff's property by selling the un-woven raw materials for profit and pawning the woven products for personal use. According to Article 336, Paragraph 2, and Article 342 of the Criminal Law, their actions constitute the crime of embezzlement and breach of trust. As an accessory civil claim, the defendant Hao Jinsheng should be responsible for compensation as he had provided a guarantee. As the defendants Tang Bushan and others were heavily indebted and intended to flee, the plaintiff requested the court to issue a warrant for their arrest and punish them for embezzlement and breach of trust, and order them to compensate the plaintiff 716.375 yuan in national currency. If execution is ineffective, the accessory civil defendant Hao Jinsheng should be responsible for payment. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Xiao of the Second Criminal Division. The defendants failed to appear. The plaintiff, accompanied by his lawyer Chen Wencan, appeared in court and presented the case. The court ordered the case to be adjourned and reheard when the defendants are summoned to appear.

### Wife Commits Adultery, Sentenced; Countersues Husband for Embezzlement; Husband Files for Divorce

Zheng Yanling, a Ningbo native and owner of the Weishun Knitting Factory at 1, Shunchang Lane, Wangzhi Road, French Concession, 29 years old, previously reported that his wife, Zhao Lianying, first committed adultery with Fan Bingxing, his sister's husband, in their hometown. After writing a letter of repentance, she then went out with a factory employee named Cui to the Far East Hotel and committed adultery. Evidence in the form of Cui's letters was found. In early October of last year, Zheng reported this to the French police, who arrested Zhao and handed her over to the Special Second Court for legal action. As a result, she was sentenced to four months of imprisonment. Zhao, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the Second Branch of the Higher Court, but the appeal was rejected. The sentence could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day. She was granted bail pending further notice. Recently, Zhao hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing her husband Zheng Yanling of embezzling 1,600 yuan in savings and requesting legal action. Based on the complaint, the court held a hearing the day before yesterday, summoning the plaintiff and her lawyer, who presented the case. The defendant did not appear. The court adjourned the hearing for a later date. It is reported that Zheng Yanling has filed a lawsuit for divorce with the Civil Division of the court.

### Bandits Collude with Fake "Police": Robbing Passengers at Wharf Ferry

Since the closing time of the public ferry at Dongchang Road in Pudong was extended from 6:00 PM to 11:00 PM, those who worked in the concessions and returned later in the evening usually took rowing boats from Roosevelt Wharf to cross the river to Pudong. Recently, bandits have been colluding with fake "police." They board rowing boats from Pudong, wait in the middle of the river, and rob passengers of their belongings, clothes, money, hats, or purchased goods in the dark. These bandits are apparently in collusion with dozens of rowers, acting lawlessly. Since the beginning of winter, many passengers have been victimized, stripped down to their underwear and forced to return home in the cold, resulting in illness. However, the Japanese and puppet authorities have not taken any action to apprehend these bandits who harm the people.

### Xinza Road: Part of It Has Been Repaired

The section of Xinza Road (New Bund Road) in the International Settlement from Chengdu Road to Mogan Road was damaged due to long-term neglect. The Public Works Department dispatched a large number of laborers to repair it. It is now reported that a portion of it has been repaired, so various rickshaws can pass westward from Datong Road. However, all kinds of rickshaws and vehicles are still prohibited from going eastward at the intersection of Mogan Road and westward at the intersection of Chengdu Road. They must detour along Shanhai Road or Xisuzhou Road along the river. Therefore, these two roads have been exceptionally busy recently.

### Guocui Bookstore to Expand

The Nanjing Guocui Bookstore is a major Shanghai secondhand bookstore, opened by Weng Peide, the owner of the old bookstore, for over 20 years. It was quite large. Last year, when the capital fell to the enemy, it could not operate. It transferred valuable ancient books to Shanghai in advance. Five months ago, it selected No. 280 Simalu (opposite the Zhonghua Book Company) to reopen. Recently, due to many collectors entrusting the sale of ancient books after the war, it decided to expand its scope and set up a book collection department. It plans to enlarge the storefront soon to serve customers. The new catalog will be compiled this month and will be published successively in newspapers.

### Two Major Contributions of Shanghai Bao

The Shanghai Bao is the backbone of small newspapers, with unique and confidential news about military and political affairs. In recent months, the content has become even more exciting. In addition to publishing daily secrets from various parties, military, and political factions, it features eight outstanding long-form works, covering various styles, all from the pens of famous writers, which are highly valuable. In December of last year, it began publishing writers' love affairs. From New Year's Day this year, it added a *Shuihu Zhuan*-style novel, with the first group titled "Group of Orioles Compete for Treasure." The writers are all famous figures in the literary world, with ancient, lush, and rigorous writing styles and bizarre and interesting plots. In order to promote the newspaper, anyone who has not read it can request a sample copy by mail, which will be sent immediately for the most recent three days for trial reading. All newspaper stalls in the city sell it, with each copy costing four steel cents.

### Record of a Banquet in the New Pharmaceutical Industry

### Reflections on the Past Year and Thoughts on the Current Situation

— Xie Jinyuan

Time flies like water. The twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China (1939) has arrived in an instant. I have been admitted to the hospital for treatment due to mental unease. Following the doctor's orders, I have removed all distractions. However, colleagues in the media have requested that I write an article to express my observations of the past year. For a time, I could not comply. Recently, compatriots in the isolated island (Shanghai) have been constantly asking about the truth and future trends due to the rumours about Jing Weishi (Wang Jingwei)'s departure and frequent rumors. I have always been optimistic about the future of the war of resistance. I have said in the past that our country's military has absolute confidence in victory. If there are any problems, they are in politics. However, political problems are not beyond salvation. Because our country has a large population and a vast space, after a protracted war of resistance, we will be able to put all political problems on track with the development of the military. In particular, today's soldiers in our country are inspired by the fearless spirit of our Supreme Leader and the revolutionary education of the nation-state, which has made the thinking of modern soldiers advance by leaps and bounds. As for the past, in the Party-state, he only bears a part of the responsibility. The words and actions of the Ning-Han split and the measures taken at the enlarged meeting, as evidenced by today's departure, what it affects the cause of the war of resistance and national construction, at best, is to confuse people and give the enemy an opportunity to provoke and spread rumors.

I think that Shi (Wang Jingwei) is an idealist, lacking a strong and consistent revolutionary belief. Judging from his past revolutionary history, he may not abandon his compatriots and join the traitors. It is believed that at this critical juncture for the country, a few telegrams or lengthy speeches will not help. Shi's move is enough to expose the declining fate of a few wavering elements in the country and make the foundation of national unity and resistance to aggression stronger. I originally had an article "The Understanding That Nationals Should Have During the War of Resistance," which was to be published on New Year's Day, but it was unsuccessful due to illness. In short, the people in this great era should have an absolutely rational and calm mind to grasp beliefs and recognize right and wrong. If they are overly nervous and ignore reality, they will only fall into the old ills of frivolity, impetuosity, and empty talk that the Chinese people have had in the past. I hope that the media will work hard to take the lead in guiding public opinion and will not over-promote all kinds of confusing, untrue news and shake the people's confidence in the war of resistance. This all-out war of resistance was originally a consistent policy of the government. As early as five years ago, there was a detailed plan. Therefore, any words and actions of Shi are not enough to affect the national policy of war of resistance. This is only a clear division between the wise and the foolish in the process of war of resistance. Today, we must recognize that only by vowing to support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will the war of resistance be won. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is the only great man who has inherited the past and opened up the future, carrying forward the historical culture of our country for five thousand years, and the leader who has laid the foundation for the nation's eternal foundation. The people must recognize that the soul of the nation is tied to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's soul is the soul of our nation. From now on, the people can only follow the meaning of "the rise and fall of the country, everyone is responsible," and each guard their posts, do their best, take the Supreme Leader's advocacy as their own advocacy, their will as their own will, and work hard to serve the country in a down-to-earth manner. Compatriots on the isolated island, at the beginning of this year, I hope everyone will review the responsibilities they have fulfilled since the year and a half of the war of resistance. At the time when millions of soldiers are fighting to the death and tens of millions of compatriots in the war zone are displaced, can we on the isolated island use the special environment to watch the fire from across the river? I, who remain on the isolated island, sincerely appeal to the compatriots on the isolated island that the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China will be the year of our country's war of resistance and national construction. I deeply hope that all compatriots on the isolated island will step up their responsibility to repay the motherland, contribute money if they have money, and contribute strength if they have strength, in order to complete the foundation of national mobilization. It is believed that the one-yuan debt repayment movement is a duty that every citizen should fulfill, and it must be promoted universally, extending to the old and young. Then, gathering strength from all, accumulating sand into a tower, the combination of the strength of 450 million people will surely become a solid Great Wall. The future of the war of resistance will surely be victorious. Otherwise, the country will be destroyed, and the family will be ruined, and we may not even be able to become the second Jewish people. At the beginning of the new year, I deeply hope that my compatriots will encourage each other.

### Zhenjiang Educator Xu Shizhu Commits Suicide by Drowning After His Nephew Joins the Rebels; Those Who Willingly Become Traitors Should Feel Ashamed to Death

(Taixian Correspondence) Xu Shizhu, a Zhenjiang educator who once served as the director of the Dantu County Education Promotion Office and the director of the Zhenjiang County Education Bureau, was a native of Dagang Township, Zhenjiang. His morality and writings were always admired by his fellow villagers and people in society. Recently, because his nephew, Xu, joined the rebels in the township, he tried to dissuade him but failed. Considering it a great shame and humiliation, he committed suicide by drowning himself in the Xinzhou area a few days ago, sacrificing himself for the country. Those who willingly become traitors should feel ashamed to death. It is said that Mr. Xu showed considerable remorse upon learning that his uncle had committed suicide for the country. (December 27th)

### The Misfortune of Jiangsu's Islamic Education; Most Islamic Schools in Various Counties Are Closed; Zhenjiang Muyuan Middle School Completely Bombed

(Taixian Correspondence) In various counties of Jiangsu Province, such as Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, Wuxian, Wuxi, Wujin, Danyang, Jiangdu, Liuhe, Tongshan, Huaiyin, and Huaian, each county has one or two Islamic private primary schools of both higher and lower levels. Although nominally Islamic private schools, they enroll both Han and Muslim children, and the number of free places is greater than the number of paid places. Because the majority of the regular expenses of Islamic private schools, apart from a small amount subsidized by the county government or education bureau, come from donations from enthusiastic Muslims and the surplus of cattle donations from various places, the schools established by Muslims in various places generally have good results. The Muyuan School, a private Islamic school in Zhenjiang, can be considered the best in the province, with a long history of more than thirty years. The original founders were predecessors among the Muslim elders of Zhenjiang, who have long since passed away. In recent years, their descendants, such as Yang Gongya, Jin Zhuren, Yang Guangyu, Jin Shaoshan, and Tong Longshan, have tried hard to maintain and gradually expand it. Last spring, after Tong Renfu made a special trip to North China to investigate the state of Islamic education in various places and returned to the province, it was generally agreed that Zhenjiang, the capital of Jiangsu Province, needed to add an Islamic middle school. With the support of domestic and foreign Muslim celebrities, such as Professor Xue of the University of Chicago in the United States, who is also the President of the World Education Association, Zhong Wei Mai Siwude, General Bai Chongxi, and Chairman Ma Lin, preparations were actively underway. The Muyuan Elementary School was expanded, classrooms were added, and it was named Muyuan Middle School. All the equipment was mostly in place, and it was planned to start classes after the winter vacation last year. Unexpectedly, on the eve of the fall of Zhenjiang, Japanese planes completely bombed the school. The current director of the preparatory office, Yang Jifu, is still a fugitive and has not returned. Fortunately, a small portion of the funds is still in the bank and has not been touched. Recently, Yang Gongya and others, members of the Muyuan Middle School Preparatory Committee and the Muyuan Elementary School Board, plan to report the losses of the school to enthusiastic Muslims in the Northwest and work together to raise funds, hoping to find a way to start classes in Shanghai or a suitable location in the un-occupied area in a short period of time. In Zhenjiang, in addition to Muyuan, there are also Qingzhen Elementary School, Zhizhen Elementary School, and Qingzhen Girls' Elementary School. Currently, they are unable to hold classes because the classrooms or school sites and equipment have been occupied or damaged by the Japanese puppets. In addition, except for Huaiyin and Huaian counties, which have temporarily suspended classes due to the impact of the war, the rest were ravaged by the Japanese army, coerced, or burned during the occupation, and most of them are unable to hold classes. It will probably not be easy to recover for a while, which is truly the misfortune of Islamic education in Jiangsu Province.

School Overview

### Guohua Middle School

Guohua Middle School on Gordon Road in this city was established in July of the 17th year of the Republic [1928]. In the early days of its opening, it focused on practical subjects. In June of the 18th year of the Republic [1929], the first graduating class consisted of more than 30 people. In July of that year, Xiao Yuan became the principal. The high school department had two tracks, general studies and business studies, while the attached junior high school department was entirely general studies. He was determined to improve the school by expanding the campus, adding equipment, and increasing the number of books and instruments as much as possible, striving for perfection, and taking meeting educational principles and adapting to the students' physical and mental needs as the purpose of running the school. In the summer of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], it was approved for registration by order of the Education Bureau. Since then, the school's foundation has become stronger day by day, and its reputation has grown day by day. Students from all over the world have come to the school in increasing numbers. In the summer of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], Principal Xiao served in other cities and had no time to take care of school affairs. At that time, the Shanghai branch of the alumni association of the National Nango Dongda Zhongda [National Southeastern University, National Tongji University, and National Central University] planned to set up a secondary school in this city, using the latest educational methods to cultivate talents for the country. Therefore, Hu Shuyi, a member of the standing committee of the association, contacted the principal of the school and, with the resolution of the board of directors, transferred the school to the association for management starting in January of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], and appointed Tian Ding'an as the successor principal. On October 12 of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], the Shanghai branch of the alumni association of the National Nango Dongda Zhongda held the fourth joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees. It was resolved that the school would be taken over by Hu Shuyi from the first semester of the 25th academic year and appointed as the standing director of the school. At the same time, Principal Tian resigned from his position as principal due to personal matters. Hu, the standing director, selected and appointed Wang Yuzhang as the concurrent principal. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the school has continued to hold classes because it is in a safe area. Later, Principal Wang went to Gan [Jiangxi], and Director Hu went to Dian [Yunnan]. The board of directors then elected Zhao Mianyun as the principal, Zheng Yimei as the director of academic affairs, Hu Situn as the director of discipline, and Xie Xianou as the director of general affairs. Thus, the organization was sound and the fortress was brand new. More than 30 well-known scholars in the country, such as Jiang Yinqiu, Lu Dan'an, Cheng Xiaoqing, Yan Yinwu, Ni Wenzhou, Pang Xiaolong, Jin Shiru, Wu Sanchi, Wang Zeping, and Gao Ti Ruo, Shen Qiwei were hired to take charge of academic affairs. The students all felt like they were sitting in the spring breeze. The school is divided into junior high school and senior high school. The senior high school has general studies and business studies and accepts both male and female students. It also has an attached Guohua Elementary School, which is a special elementary school of the Zhonghua Book Company. The school has 700 students, a football field, and a basketball field, all of which are very spacious. Students do extracurricular activities here in the morning and evening. As for management and education, the school insists on strictness. There are two small exams and one big exam every semester, which are quite strict.

### International Cup Football Preliminary: China United Hard-Fought Victory over England 3-1; Three Goals in a Row in the Second Half to Come From Behind; Meng Yiliang Temporarily Added as Left Forward

In the preliminary round of the International Cup football match, the China United team met with England at Yiyuan yesterday. Nearly 10,000 spectators watched, and the grand occasion was no less than the Christmas charity match. China United came from behind and eliminated England with a score of 3-1, advancing to the second week. Because the China United center-back line still felt weak, a special election committee meeting was convened before the game, and it was passed that Meng Yiliang would be added as the left forward as proposed by Le Xiurong. England's Simmons was absent. After the start of the game, England's Watt was awarded a penalty kick and opened the scoring. In the second half, China United cheered up and showed great momentum. Sun Tie-tui [Iron Leg], Li Yichen, succeeded one after another, coming from behind. Finally, Dai Linjing scored a goal, and China United reversed the defeat with a score of 3-1.

China United Team:

Zhou Dayun, Zhuang Youren, Zhang Lingen, Meng Yiliang, Xu Chengxun, Jiang Zhaoxiang, Wan Xianghua, Li Yichen, Dai Linjing, Sun Jinshun, Cao Youliang

England:

Pi Shigu, Hai Liesun, Lugen, Jie Muwater, Jielai, Hui Sihute, Laiyin, Katepei, Bao Duke, Huatuosi, Paier

Penalty Kick, China United Falls Behind

The English team attacked first, but went deep into the hinterland and gained nothing. Before long, Xu Chengdong invaded and was penalized for a free kick. Hui Sihute tried a long shot, and Jiang Zhaoxiang stepped forward to block it. Paier attacked from the side and raised his foot to kick the door. Zhou Dayun lay down and saved it, rolling out not far away. Katepei caught up and pushed it, fortunately it went out of bounds. China United counterattacked, but without success. Bao Duke knocked on the door alone, and Zhou Dayun jumped up to catch it. At twelve minutes, Xu Chengxun elbowed someone and was penalized for a penalty kick. Watt kicked off and the ball flew into the net. China United lost a goal first. The English team took advantage of the situation and committed another crime, all of which were caught by Zhou Dayun. Zhuang Youren fouled, and Hui Sihe took a free kick from 25 yards, but was again saved by Zhou. The five forwards of China United worked hard to counterattack, but all failed. Hui Sihe once left the field due to injury and soon returned. At halftime, the English team estimated the yuan with a score of 1-0.

Tie-tui Scores, Leveling the Score

The second battle began, and China United washed away the sluggishness of the first half. The English team was energetic and vigorous. Li Yichen was awarded a free kick. Because he was eager to win, he hit the ball with his hand and was kicked out by the opponent's goalkeeper. Xiao Wan sneaked in from the left and passed Tie-tui. Sun got the ball and shot. Pi Shigu failed to lift it out. Dai Linjing stopped the enemy general. Sun calmly shot again, and the iron leg started, and it went into the net. A tie of 1-1 was made, and the cheers were thunderous. It was only seven minutes before the continuation of the game. China United launched another siege. Pi Shigu took the ball out of danger in the chaos. Jinshun, Youliang, and Adai all had wonderful works, but unfortunately they all became pie in the sky. Youliang pounced on the enemy's goal again, and Pi Shigu fell to the ground in panic. Sun Tie-tui was half a step late and missed another good opportunity. Adai shot and forced a corner kick. Youliang opened it very well. Pi Shigu kicked out Tie-tui's cross, but Xiao Wan failed to catch up. China United had many opportunities, but none of them succeeded.

Three Goals in a Row, Everyone Is Happy

China United attacked repeatedly but failed, but its momentum did not diminish slightly. At seventeen minutes, Li Yichen got Youliang's hook and sent it from fifteen yards from the goal, a wonderful test of his superb skills. The ball flew into the corner of the goal, clear and beautiful. The whole place applauded. China United was ahead with a score of 2-1, and the generals became more enthusiastic. The English team counterattacked, and Laiyin knocked on the door, hitting Xu Chengxun and turning it into a corner kick. Laiyin opened it and sent it to Shi Dayun's hand. Hui Qihe shot from a distance, and Dayun lay down and pounced into the air. Bao Duke added a pick, fortunately it crossed the crossbar. At thirty-five minutes, Meng Yiliang blocked the ball, and the referee penalized a penalty kick. The audience shouted injustice. Watt shot wide, as if deliberately. In the last three minutes, Sun Tie-tui and Dai Lin rode side by side, passing each other, reaching the appropriate point. Adai kicked hard, and the English goal fell again. In a few minutes, the silver whistle rang for a long time, and China United eliminated England with a score of 3-1.

### Special Charity Football Match: Reporter Team Wins Referee Team 7-3 to Reclaim the French Business Cup

A special charity football match, the reporter team vs. the referee team, was held at Yiyuan at 10:30 a.m. yesterday. The referee was Le Xiurong, and both players and referees purchased tickets to enter the arena. The income was one hundred and several tens of yuan. Among the Chinese participants, only Lu Zhongen was on the reporter team, while Liu Chunshu, Lu Shunde, Ni Xiaoben, and others were on the referee team. The match between the two sides was full of gimmicks, making people laugh. The reporters relied on better cooperation and scored three goals in a row, taking a 3-0 lead in the first half. After 6-2 in the second half, the referee goalkeeper defected, and the referee team actually got extra money. As a result, the reporter team won a big victory over the referee team with a score of 7-3. The "French Business Cup" that the referee team had preserved in the previous session was declared to have changed hands.

Spring and Autumn

### "Half-Dice"

— Lishi

"Half-Dice" is a term used in "gang circles" and is a synonym for those "fickle" friends, so it is also a derogatory term.

The psychology, behavior, and speech of a "Half-Dice" are unpredictable. Sometimes he is very brave and enterprising, while at other times he is very timid and cowardly; sometimes he will generously sacrifice himself for righteousness, while at other times he will shamelessly serve the enemy; sometimes he will speak out for justice with eloquence, while at other times he will babble and deny the truth. In short, he has no backbone, no soul, no sense of justice. He is like a weak willow in the wind, a duckweed on the water, knowing only to follow the current.

What "gang circles" need are loyal and righteous fighters willing to endure "three cuts and six holes," so for those "fickle" "gang members," they are given the nickname "Half-Dice" so that the general "gang members" can identify them and impose appropriate sanctions.

Because of the shameful psychology, the base behavior, and the inconsistent speech of the "Half-Dice," he will be looked down upon by the general "gang members." However, in order to survive, he has to work hard in life skills, and cunning, treacherousness, and ruthlessness are his specialties. He will not only use cunning means to defraud his friends of their property, but also betray his friends and betray his "boss" under his selfish emotions. Therefore, the "Half-Dice" is not only shameful, but also deserves to be killed!

There are "Half-Dice" in "gang circles," and there are also "Half-Dice" in general society; and "Half-Dice" have existed since ancient times, but they are even more rampant today. Qin Hui's greed for wealth and power led him to rely on the Jin people to increase his own importance; Wu Sangui, for the sake of his beloved concubine Chen Yuanyuan, led the Qing troops into the pass; and the current batch of "funny" friends, puppets on stage, are all "Half-Dice" of the nation and the country. As for the petty merchants and below, there are even more "Half-Dice" than hairs on an ox, easily found everywhere, only differing in the degree of baseness and the amount of money they are after.

However, although the "Half-Dice" is cunning, treacherous, and ruthless, able to deceive for a time and live comfortably, he will only die when he encounters "righteousness" and "moral principles." Therefore, although the world is deteriorating now and everyone wants to be a "Half-Dice," no one wants to be a "Half-Dice." If someone is popular, has a history, has made considerable achievements, or has a considerable status, then even if they want to be a "Half-Dice," they would not dare to give up on themselves and become a "Half-Dice."

However, there are exceptions in reality. Those with history and achievements are now also trying to embark on the path of "Half-Dice"! Alas! If the "Half-Dice" does not die, there will be no righteousness in the world!

### Moving Forward Towards the Dawn of Victory

— Tian

On New Year's Eve, the people of the "isolated island" spent the last day of 1938 in a frenzy of dancing, fueled by the remaining energy of Christmas.

This is the second time celebrating the New Year on the "isolated island." The first New Year was just after the National Army's westward retreat and the fall of the capital. Shanghai was exactly like its newly added title, as desolate and bleak as an "isolated island." This New Year is clearly different, with the heat and hustle not inferior to pre-war times.

Does this mean that the people on the "isolated island" have completely forgotten their motherland? Naturally, we cannot deny that some people have become numb to the current environment; but it is definitely not the whole.

While frantically dancing the most popular "Lai Shan Bo" dance, the lights of the entire dance floor suddenly emitted a powerful glow, and in the distance, a bright chime was ringing—twelve o'clock, causing the musicians to stand up solemnly and play a familiar melody. The dancers, awakened by the music, could not help but sing the song "The Three Principles of the People, Our Party's Aim." A dance floor mixed with powder and sweat a second ago was now like a solemn holy land, with every patriotic heart and every drop of boiling blood seemingly detached from their bodies and flying to a distant world. In that world, our compatriots are fighting the enemy with blood and sweat to win the survival of our nation!

Only traitors with lost hearts and illnesses linger at the "Gates of Peace"! Nothing is more sorrowful than the death of the heart, but the hearts of the "isolated island" have not died!

Therefore, at the beginning of this new year, everyone should constantly remind themselves to stand firm and contribute every little bit of effort. The fatigue accumulated over the year has been compensated for by these three days of rest. From today onwards, we should be invigorated and do the work that every citizen should do, at least adhering to the creed of frugality and saving the nation, and not wasting precious money and sound spirits in useless places.

March forward towards the dawn of victory; the day we reach it will be the day we revel!

Movie Review

### Phoenix and Luan Companions

— Baihua

The Girl of the Golden West produced by MGM, showing at the Nanjing Grand Theatre

Since "Phoenix Flying Together" and "Peach Blossom Hate," the separation of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy has left their audience with endless feelings of reluctance. "Phoenix and Luan Companions" can cooperate again, and as a New Year's screening, it naturally has no problem in terms of "box office appeal." But we should also remember "War Time Serenade" (starring Jeanette MacDonald and Allan Jones), which was also shown in Nanjing last year. Not only is the script authentic, but the director's excellent, lively, and coherent technique makes "Phoenix and Luan Companions" pale in comparison.

"Phoenix and Luan Companions" is a newly adapted Western, and the religious meaning is too strong. The repentance and reform of the brave and chivalrous thief Ray Maris (Nelson Eddy), who robs the rich and helps the poor, and the local official Luns Zhimanli (Jeanette MacDonald) sincerely loving Ray Maris, and "resolutely retiring and making good things happen," even if religion really has a transforming power, then this transforming power is not enough.

Director Robert Z. Leonard handles individual scenes with considerable vigor, but the whole play seems to be not tight enough in connection. At the beginning, it makes people feel very dull, which is mostly due to the trivial story and the inability to properly adjust time and space.

Nelson Eddy does not seem to be very suitable for playing this type of role. Riding high and wearing a wide hat, there seems to be a stereotypical figure in Hollywood. This is also the biggest loss of "Phoenix and Luan Companions." But the director still succeeded in portraying the crude but lovely character of the Western people and the rich local colors.

For example, in the scene where Manli participates in the festival, starting from Ray Maris intercepting the officer's uniform, pretending to be Lieutenant John, and rushing to the meeting, the crazy Spanish dance and Eddy's loud singing, the atmosphere of that scene is extremely tense. The greatness of the scene and the activity of the camera are even more trivial. Manli's singing in the church is also a rare lively shot.

The most moving scenes are the following. On Manli's birthday, the local official Luns sent her a piano. The old professor played the piano, Manli sang, and everyone sang in harmony, and Luns also revealed his heartfelt happiness; later, Manli agreed to marry Luns. Before going to the church to get married, the old professor still played the piano, but she was already sobbing and could not speak. In contrast, the director tightly controlled the emotions at the time.

The scene where Ray Maris and Manli made an appointment to dine together in a wooden house was also the same. After Ray Maris was shot and injured, Luns tracked him down, and Manli hid him in the attic, but when they shook hands, the blood stains on the attic just dripped on his hand. Later, gambling was used to decide the marriage, and he was found cheating, and finally he married Luns on the condition of releasing Ray Maris. In the process of "love and death struggle," not only the director's skills are surpassed, but Jeanette MacDonald also performed very well in the psychological conflict of not being able to "have both."

### Anecdotes of Shanghai

— Hang Qi Master

Female Ballad Singer (5)

Writing to this point, I recalled that there are also many descriptions of female ballad singers in the "Bamboo Branch Poems." For example, Bang Jiang's "Shanghai Bamboo Branch Poems" says: "Singing ballads is called the female pioneer, a young and beautiful girl has just arrived from Suzhou. Holding the pipa halfway to cover her face, smiling and lowering her head to learn how to toss coins." This proves that although female ballad singers were mostly from Changshu in the early days, later people from all over Suzhou also learned it.

Yunqi Layman's "Yang Chang Ballad Poems," in his "Ballad" poem, says: "The heavenly girl ascends the platform to compose music, a wonderful and unmasked meeting. The sound of Sheng and song reaches the ears, and the fragrance of silk and satin secretly arises, captivating the soul. With solemn makeup and bright candles, carefully present the clapper and golden wine cup. This is the ultimate beauty of the world, and from now on I no longer envy dancing neon clothes." This, together with Shen Jiang Old Master's "Thirty Good Things of Shen Jiang," which says: "Shen Jiang is good, the names of the bookstores are marked. Excluding men, women are respected, only talking about strings and not Sheng and Xiao, day after day," and the "Shanghai North-South Bamboo Branch Rhymes," which says: "The ballad girl has a beautiful face, casually turning the sandalwood groove to reveal her finger ring. The most affectionate is her pretended smile, gently shaking the painted fan to tidy up her hair," all demonstrate that the so-called "female ballad singers" and the audience's understanding of them were mostly not for storytelling and listening to stories.

"Shanghai North-South Bamboo Branch Rhymes" also says: "A pipa song captivates all present, the beauty is also called Mr., who is the most outstanding among them, Wu Suqing and Huang Aiqing," and "Jingting's legacy is enough to please, it is rare to say books clearly tomorrow. Yuan's tune is high and Yan's tune is stable, if you talk about demeanor, give way to the three Zhus," and it is noted: "The female book speakers, Yuan Yunxian and Yan Lizhen are the best. The three Zhus are Sulan, Suqing, and Youxiang." And it is enough to supplement the lack of "A Small Record of Female Ballad Singers" by Chi Ping Sou. Character evaluation poems, this book contains the most, it was published in the second year of Guangxu (1876), and the author was about the same time as Chi Ping Sou. The evaluation poem says:

Wang Lijuan—Heaven has repeatedly descended the Fairy of Book Holding, Wang Lijuan should be pushed as the leader. A kind of elegance and high style, why is it necessary to let Cheng Lian move his feelings.

Yuan Yunxian—The book arena is noisy with setting sun dogs, the owner of the hall and the official all cooperate. When the report arrives, Mr. Oil Bi will arrive, everyone looks at Yunxian with green eyes.

Zhu Youxiang—Brilliant and innocent Zhu Youxiang, the small pipa pluck has a beautiful sound. Jiao Han also has the intention of relying on others, it is good to be reserved next to the mother.

Wang Youjuan—Youjuan is extremely intelligent, the light smile and frown are even more pitiful. Weak body, how can you bear to be too thin, do not let Tingting stand in the wind.

Yan Lizhen—The old elegant Yan Lizhen, a glance when she enters the arena seems to be affectionate. People compete to listen to the Wa Pao vegetarian, the words are clear in the sound of strings.

Chen Yue'e—Could it be that Su'e was demoted from the Moon Palace, traveling in the mortal world to remember Jiao Ge. The ice string plays towards the dissolving moon, and there is much hatred in the sad voice.

Chapter 1: One-Armed Elder Organizes a Free Village, Twin Girls Reverently Visit the Cemetery of Martyrs

He replaced the summer and winter vacations of those schools in the city with these two busy farming seasons, but when the schools in the city had summer and winter vacations, he did not take a vacation. Then what does he do during the busy farming season? He is also a country person, doesn't he have any fields? How can he not have them? He and his brother have more than 20 acres of private land. Because his brother is deceased, he gave the land to his two nephews to farm. When they are really too busy, he will come and help, directing them, and that is enough. Besides, he still spends most of his time in the small teahouse, and he stays there even more during the busy farming season. But he also has many things to do in the small teahouse: one is to read and write letters for people, because at that time, many people in the countryside did not know how to read, especially rural women. A Da's mother works as a helper in Suzhou; A Er's grandfather works in a factory in Shanghai. When letters arrive, they always have to be taken to the small teahouse to ask the teacher to read them to them. In turn, they ask the teacher to write a reply. His colloquial letters are much smoother and clearer than those of the fortune-telling gentlemen in the city. He doesn't ask for any reward, but the country people naturally pick pumpkins and send him a big one; they cook dishes and send him two bowls to eat. The second thing is that he often tells the public news in the small teahouse, because a friend in the village works as a clerk in a cloth factory in the city. That cloth factory reads a Shen Bao, and throws it away after reading it. He finds a way to pay a few cents for postage to send the Shen Bao that he has read to the countryside. Although the days have already passed three or four days, it is still fresh in the countryside, after all, it is news. Many people hold up at the small teahouse, there is nothing else, when they are free, they always play mahjong. Two hundred chips, three hundred chips, just keep shoveling them down. Even to the point of fighting because they lost money, teapots and benches flying together. However, that kind of atmosphere has not yet prevailed in his small teahouse. Many people who sit in the teahouse just talk and talk. Or tell some stories, not escaping the humor of idle talk in a melon shed. Everyone also pesters this country teacher to tell them the news published in the newspaper. What people are in power in the government now, what kind of person has recently replaced the county magistrate, how much will the discounted price of rent rice be per stone this year. In a small teahouse, they also discuss national affairs and local administration. Don't look at it as a small newspaper, it can increase a lot of knowledge among the country people. (3)

Commercial News Business and Industry Talks

### The Suffering of Japanese Cotton Mills from the Tianjin Cotton Monopoly

— Zheng Wu

At the end of last year, a new development emerged in the foreign cotton trade in this city, namely that various Japanese factories in Shanghai have been purchasing large quantities of American and Brazilian cotton. This abnormal situation has attracted considerable attention from the cotton industry. Since the Japanese government has vigorously implemented a policy of strong economic control, strictly limiting the people from purchasing European and American raw materials, it is surprising that the Japanese factories in Shanghai are now ordering large quantities of foreign cotton for textile use. The reason for this abnormal phenomenon is definitely not solely based on the fall in the price of foreign cotton; the actual factors are driven by various environmental pressures.

Since the outbreak of the war, in order to strengthen its wartime finances, Japan has been trying to open up new avenues for economic trade, using its consistent policy of controlling all trade in our guerrilla areas through both military force and economic means, in order to support the development of Japanese businesses in the areas temporarily occupied by the Japanese army. Especially in the cotton spinning industry, it has used the counterfeit currency of the puppet organizations and the military notes issued by the Japanese military affairs department to absorb as much legal currency as possible in the Japanese-occupied areas, and then used the legal currency to purchase cotton from various regions for the consumption of the Japanese cotton mills. Therefore, since the resumption of work after the war, the raw cotton used by the Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai has largely been cotton from the North China region.

However, recently, due to the increased demand for Tianjin cotton, the price has been increasing daily, and the exchange rate between Shanghai and Tianjin has also risen due to the need for legal currency in North China. Furthermore, on the other hand, in order to strengthen the credit of the puppet currency of the United Reserve Bank of North China, the Japanese authorities have been vigorously devaluing the legal currency circulating in various parts of North China, stipulating that every hundred yuan of legal currency is equivalent to eighty yuan of the puppet currency of the United Reserve Bank of North China. Under such circumstances, it is the same as raising the price of North China cotton, resulting in a sharp decrease in the amount of Tianjin cotton shipped to Shanghai due to the significant price difference. Moreover, since December 1st, the Japanese military has instructed the "Provisional Government" of Peiping to strictly prohibit the export of cotton and implement cotton price controls. As a result, various Japanese factories have felt the pain of a lack of raw cotton supply. Under these unmanageable circumstances, they have had to purchase foreign cotton to meet their urgent need for raw materials.

Since the beginning of the war, Japan has needed a huge amount of cotton for manufacturing munitions. Its domestic economic strength is weak. It has no huge amount of gold to export to exchange for foreign raw cotton. So Japan's only way is to collect cotton in the guerrilla areas of China and transport it back to Japan for domestic consumption. Therefore, in order to purchase cotton from these areas at a limited price, the Japanese government authorities used the name of the "Provisional Government" to implement control. Because North China cotton production could not be transported out, the price of cotton plummeted. The Japanese government took the opportunity to devalue the currency and transport all the North China cotton production, except for local consumption, to Japan. This has indeed dealt a major blow to the raw material supply of the Japanese-owned cotton mills in this city. According to statistics, in the past three months, the amount of Chinese cotton transported to Japan has reached as much as 1.5 million dan. In fact, this number does not yet include the figures for exports to Japan after the ban on cotton exports was announced on December 1st. However, the amount of cotton needed by Japan is still far from this number. Therefore, Japan hopes to continue to absorb as much as possible in the various guerrilla areas to meet its domestic needs.

However, in the past few months, the transportation of cotton from the cotton-producing areas in North China to various places has increased due to the improved trade in cloth in various places, the resumption of work in various cotton mills, and the increasing number of new spindles installed. On the other hand, the cotton-producing areas have shrunk due to the war situation. Under this state of demand exceeding supply, the price of cotton has risen sharply. At this time, Japan's plan to absorb Chinese cotton at a low price has encountered great obstacles. Therefore, it prohibits exports, so that all the cotton is hoarded in various regions, allowing it to fall in price on its own. Japan can then purchase and transport the low-priced cotton to Japan as it wishes. Whether this kind of means can achieve its effect, we can hardly determine, but at present, the Japanese-owned cotton mills in Shanghai are in a greater panic about the supply of raw cotton because of the implementation of this cotton production control.

Due to the above reasons, the Japanese-owned cotton mills in Shanghai have no other way to remedy the cut off raw cotton supply except to purchase American cotton, Brazilian cotton, and Indian cotton.

In conclusion, the current phenomenon of raw material supply shortages in various Japanese cotton mills is enough to show the extreme tightness of funds in various Japanese factories. According to the general situation, any cotton mill, according to the usual practice, should have at least three to six months' worth of raw cotton reserves. From this point of view, even if there is a temporary shortage of raw materials, there should be no problems, and the stored cotton can be used to wait for future purchases to replenish it. However, in fact, various Japanese-owned cotton mills, because their home government needs to raise funds for national war expenditures, have repeatedly decided to levy heavy "patriotic taxes." Therefore, although their operations are showing a significant surplus, their circulating funds are mostly showing a difficult phenomenon. They can only purchase raw materials at any time and use them for weaving. There is no huge amount of funds to purchase and store cotton. Therefore, at this time, they have to purchase foreign cotton as the only remedy.

In summary, under this special state of interruption of the North China source, the shipment of foreign cotton to Shanghai will inevitably increase day by day.

### The Anglo-American Trade Agreement and the Trade Relationship Between Britain and Canada

According to the December report of the Royal Bank of Canada (TheRoyal Bank of Canada), the newly announced trade agreements between the United States and Canada and between Britain and the United States make it easy to imagine the significance of their commercial relationship. The United States and Canada initially concluded a trade agreement in November 1935, which was implemented on January 1 of the following year for a period of three years. During these three years, the commerce between the two countries was greatly stimulated. After the old agreement expired, a new one was concluded. The conclusion of this new agreement will further promote the commercial development of the two countries, which can be expected.

According to official U.S. statistics, Canada's exports to the United States in 1935 were US$286 million, and imports from the United States were US$323 million. Therefore, the U.S. trade surplus was US$37 million. In 1936, the first year of the implementation of the U.S.-Canada trade agreement, Canada's export trade increased to US$376 million. This was because the United States suffered from drought that year, which led to a sharp increase in the export of Canadian wheat, livestock, and other agricultural products to the United States. In addition, the export of industrial supplies such as timber also saw a large increase, especially in British Columbia. At the same time, U.S. exports to Canada also increased, but the amount was not large. The total amount exported to Canada that year was US$384 million. Therefore, the export volume of the two countries was almost equal, with a difference of only US$8 million. The following year, in 1937, U.S. exports to Canada increased significantly compared to the previous year, reaching a total of US$510 million, an increase of US$126 million. Canada's exports were US$399 million, an increase of US$23 million. The U.S. trade surplus with Canada that year was US$111 million, while it was only US$8 million in the previous year. Later, the U.S. economy declined, and agricultural production was abundant, which led to a sharp decline in Canadian goods exported to the United States. This trend continued in 1938. In the first eight months of 1938, Canada's products exported to the United States fell to US$162 million, while in the same period last year it was US$279 million. On the other hand, U.S. goods exported to Canada maintained their good condition, amounting to US$323 million, while in the same period last year it was US$336 million. Therefore, in 1938, the U.S. trade surplus with Canada reached US$161 million.

The commerce between the United States and Canada occupies an important position in their foreign trade. Why? Looking at the total export volume of the United States and Canada in 1930, the combined total was more than US$100 million, of which US exports to Canada were US$659 million, and Canadian exports to the United States were US$402 million. During the years of U.S. economic decline, the trade between the two countries also saw a sharp decline. However, during the nine years from 1930 to 1938, the total export volume of the two countries was US$650 million, of which US exports to Canada were US$375 million, and Canadian exports to the United States were US$275 million. From this point of view, in the total amount of U.S. foreign trade, Canada accounts for one-seventh of its export volume, and in terms of the total U.S. trade surplus, the trade surplus with Canada alone, at US$100 million, accounts for one-quarter of the total trade surplus.

In conclusion, although the total amount of U.S. trade with Britain is not as large as that with Canada, the annual average total amount from 1930 to 1938 was US$569 million, of which U.S. exports to Britain were US$460 million, and British exports to the United States were US$141 million. The largest portion of U.S. exports to Britain was raw cotton. For example, in the year from July 1937 to July 1938, Britain purchased US$85 million worth of U.S. cotton, which exceeded more than twice the amount of cotton purchased from the United States by any other country in the world (France was in second place with US$40 million). In the past nine years, the U.S. trade surplus with Britain has averaged US$287 million per year. The world knows that Britain is a country with a large trade deficit, but it may not be fully known to the world that U.S. goods account for a large portion of the trade deficit.

During the above nine years, the U.S.'s total export volume averaged US$380 million per year. Within this figure, U.S. exports to Canada were nearly US$100 million, and exports to Britain reached US$287 million. In other words, the U.S. has had a trade surplus every year for nine years, which can be said to be purely due to these two countries.

Although the United States and Canada bear a great responsibility in terms of trade conditions, on the other hand, many Americans travel to Canada and spend a lot of money, which makes Canada's balance of payments with the United States more favorable. Therefore, if this "trade created by travel" is included, since 1931, the U.S. has purchased more Canadian goods annually than Canada has purchased U.S. goods. By the same token, the United States pays a large amount of money to Britain for shipping, insurance, etc. Therefore, in the final conclusion of the two countries, Britain's commercial situation is much better than that estimated based solely on export trade.

In modern times, all countries consider the amount of their export trade to determine the increase or decrease in import volume. Therefore, the balance of trade is particularly important. If the world were not the world it is today, but an ideal world, free from the constraints of tariff policies and other commercial restrictions, then according to economic principles, a country would purchase goods from the market with the lowest prices and sell goods to the market with the highest prices. Therefore, even if a country has an imbalance of payments, it would not be a major issue. Why? Other multilateral interrelationships can quickly compensate for its shortcomings. However, under the commercial policies dominated by nationalism, this problem becomes more serious. During each Imperial Conference, various departments of the British government are eager to obtain a larger share of the domestic market. However, Argentina, Sweden, Norway, and other countries are large purchasers of British goods. Therefore, when Britain controls the quantities of its various imperial departments, it cannot ignore these countries. Since Britain absorbs such a large and huge amount of exports from various countries in the world, its various imperial departments and other countries have made significant concessions to obtain priority in their imports to Britain. Therefore, if Britain wants to continue to buy the U.S.'s surplus products, the limited amount of imports from other countries will inevitably become narrower.

Britain has made huge overseas investments. Therefore, Britain has recognized for many years that a trade deficit is necessary, because purchasing goods from abroad can enable other countries to fulfill the payment of the benefits due from their investments. Due to this concession, Britain has obtained better loan benefits than other countries. Emerging countries mostly lack resources. Therefore, when commerce is sluggish, the maintainers of world financial stability must be the advanced countries with abundant resources. If countries can promote international trade in good faith, without restrictions, and without interfering with trade surpluses, allowing free entry and exit, they will surely reduce the current world difficulties greatly. The result will be that emerging countries can continue to fulfill their debt obligations. During this period, Britain has always been in a position of a large trade deficit without concern. Its great contribution to the revival of world commerce is by no means shallow. However, the recovery of world commerce will ultimately benefit Britain's foreign trade and make progress. (A)

### Sugar Market: Red and White Sugar Remain Tight

The sugar market trend was good yesterday. The guild's price assessment for No. 24 Dutch coarse white sugar from the Blue Funnel warehouse was once assessed at 24 yuan and 3 jiao. Sugar from this warehouse was 24 yuan and 4 jiao and a half. Re-exported sugar was 16 yuan and 1 jiao. The spot price of Taikoo refined white sugar for delivery at Pudong warehouse was assessed at 23 yuan and a half. Later, the price was called up to 23 yuan and 8 jiao, but no transaction was made. Lower-grade HX mark sugar was 23 yuan and 4 jiao, and there were some transactions. The Chao Gang offered high cotton red sugar at 15 yuan and 2 jiao, a good start with an increase of 2 jiao, and ordinary sugar at 13 yuan and a half. The Shang Mian white sugar was 23 yuan and 3 or 4 jiao. The Jian Gang offered Shilu road red sugar at 14 yuan and 7 jiao and a half to 6 jiao, and Shilu foreign sugar at 15 yuan and a half. The asking price for Shangzhuang Quan white sugar was tighter, and the market trend may slightly rebound.

### Hardware: Tin Plate Shortage Turns Upbeat

Since the outbreak of the war, the source of tin plate has been scarce. For example, Ganzhou tin, Jianghua tin, Hengdi tin, and small tin have either become war zones or cannot be shipped to Shanghai due to transportation difficulties. Therefore, the inventory in this port has been in short supply. Fortunately, the outgoing route is not very smooth, so the market price has not soared wildly except for a steady increase. Recently, due to a certain company's purchasing, spot goods are extremely scarce, and the market is soaring. For example, Xiaogeng tin opened at 370 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous price. Dutch tin was 395 yuan, also an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous price. Other rolled bar tin with a purity of 99 or above also opened at 390 yuan. All other solder tin and bucket tin are trending upwards. However, there is very little goods on the market, so the market sentiment is exceptionally optimistic.

### North-South Goods: Sun-Dried Meat Rises by One Yuan

Recently, a total of 36 pieces of sun-dried meat have arrived. Yesterday, they were all sold out, with an increase of one yuan compared to the previous price, and distributed through various firms. It is said that there will not be many more goods arriving.

### On Excretion

— Ding San

Our excretion, urination, and sweating are the excretion of waste materials from inside the body. If these waste materials accumulate, they will not only prevent the absorption of nutrients, but also become toxic substances, making the entire body weak.

Toxic substances in the body sometimes lurk inside, causing internal diseases; sometimes they come out, causing external diseases. To treat internal diseases, one must promote bowel movements and sweating; to treat external diseases, one must cut and treat sores and boils; in short, it still depends on excretion first.

The structure of a political society is somewhat similar to the structure of an individual's physiology, although they cannot be mechanically regarded as the same. Inside, there are also nutrients—healthy components—and waste—corrupt components. To make a nation strong, one must naturally, from the structure of the political society, relentlessly eliminate corrupt components and introduce healthy components.

Waste materials in the political and social structure will similarly prevent the absorption of nutrients; and if they are allowed to grow and develop, the result will inevitably be toxic substances. These toxic substances sometimes lurk in the dark, carrying out their destructive effects, causing hidden illnesses in the nation; sometimes they are openly released, carrying out their ulcerative effects, causing external illnesses in the nation. To treat this kind of disease, the whole country must have keen awareness, and wage a merciless struggle against the toxic substances transformed from those waste materials, eliminating them and cutting them away!

However, perhaps some people will ask, wouldn't doing this split the unity of the nation? Then, I would also ask in return: Doesn't your excretion, urination, sweating, or cutting away rotten flesh from sores and boils, split the unity of your body? Is this question valid? No! Because not excreting waste and toxic substances will not only fail to strengthen unity, but will also damage unity; excreting waste and toxic substances is precisely eliminating the components that harm unity, in order to absorb more and strengthen the components of unity, so as to make the nation stronger!

Therefore, we should not worry excessively that some corrupt components entrenched in the political and social structure are being continuously purged, considering it a division of unity, but rather we should rejoice that it is a strengthening of unity.

Our country's war of resistance against Japan this time, from an internal point of view, is precisely a general excretion, which is also called a general liquidation. In the war of resistance, the waste materials and toxic substances accumulated in the political and social structure over the past few years—separatist warlords, corrupt officials, and traitors—have all revealed their true colors and been eliminated; at the same time, the progressive elements who are determined to resist Japan, courageous, active, and hard-working, have been absorbed and introduced; making our country's war of resistance unity, because of the qualitative change, become increasingly strong!

The more intense the war of resistance, the easier it is for those waste materials and toxic substances to be exposed, and the easier it is to excrete them at the same time. This is by no means a bad phenomenon, but precisely a good phenomenon. Eliminating them is by no means dividing unity, but rather strengthening unity. We should not be pessimistic about this, but rather be optimistic about it, and we should also step up the work of excretion, so that our resistance forces become stronger; only then can we strive for the final victory in the war of resistance and national reconstruction!

### The Happy Jin Family Village

— Xu Qi

"Ah! What a crowd!" Little Mao's mother, carrying a bucket of water, hobbled into the door, her teeth could no longer hold back the sound coming from her hoarse throat.

Little Mao's father was not there, which made her excitement turn into a burst of disappointment. She muttered:

"Damn it! Where did he go? So early in the morning..."

Little Mao sat under the stove, the stove hole was not yet lit, but it was always so warm. She sang softly: Wearing colored hemp strips, green here, yellow there.

"They arrived as soon as the first cock crowed!" Sister-in-law Aqi's bad-breathed mouth was always spraying towards Little Mao's mother. She showed off the glory of knowing early.

The sun, like a big red persimmon, was thrown from behind the mountain to the top of the mountain. The frost at the end of November was covered with a layer of gold. Today, the entire Jin Family Village was filled with vitality and joy. Even the big-bellied pigs were pacing out step by step, looking quite serene.

"Cook rice, do housework, three meals only need one bundle of firewood!"

"Little Mao!"

Little Mao jumped up and hugged her mother's leg. Her mother lightly tapped her forehead.

"Good girl! Mom will take you to see the excitement, ah! So many soldiers!"

"But are the yellow-clothed dwarf soldiers here again?" Little Mao had a shiver.

"Little girl! This time they are green-clothed soldiers. They are all tall. The yellow-clothed soldiers don't dare to come anymore!"

Little Mao held her mother's clothes and ran out. Little Mao's mother, hobbling, couldn't go fast. Little Mao was anxious and walked on one foot, more than ten feet away from her mother.

"Oh! What a crowd!"

The neighbors were chatting and laughing while chewing on sorghum cakes. In the field, under the shed, sat many old folks whom they had not seen for many days. They were still so quiet, amiable, and happy. Also, horses were smelling the soil under the elm trees with a snorting sound. On the field artillery, they all

They talked for a long time like old friends reunited. The cook used agile means to cook breakfast, comically blackening his face and hands. White steam rose in gusts, mixed with the sound of talking.

"They came from Village X!"

"Village X! More than a hundred li away!"

"It's nothing to us. We can rush the journey of three or four days in one breath."

"..."

The children mixed in with them and called to play. Little Mao climbed onto the back of a fat soldier who almost couldn't wear his military hat.

"Little baby! Come down, I'll teach you to sing!" Entangled so that he couldn't do anything, he lifted Little Mao down. Little Mao sat on his lap, stroking his Qing Tian Bai Ri hat badge.

"Come! Come! Come! Everyone come together! Regardless of men, women, old or young, pick up hoes and sickles! We are not afraid of planes and artillery, ××! ××! Don't you run away!"

Little Mao learned to sing, babbling. Little Mao's mother, suppressing her hoarse throat, told her not to be naughty. Little Mao didn't hear at all.

In that song, Little Mao's father came with a group of people, carrying full loads of things. Lame Old Ba and silly Ah San carried a newly slaughtered pig, shoulder to shoulder, staggering from side to side. The village chief was like a short pier. Today, he put on a mandarin jacket. His face was as swollen as a pig's liver. He said in a string:

"Everyone, thank you for your hard work! Thank you for coming to our village. This is just a little respect, but it really doesn't count, it really doesn't count!"

An officer stood up quite politely to greet the village chief. He was very young, with a delicate face, and still wearing a pair of leather gloves.

"There! There! Your things are all earned with sweat. How can we accept them without deserving it? We don't touch the people's grass or trees wherever we pass. You just remember, you see us, you have freedom, you can live a good life again, the enemy will never come again, your area is our sphere of influence. Now, take these things back! It's not easy for you either..."

Little Mao's father and his group put down their things and walked away, making the young officer keep waving his hands.

Jin Family Village became a paradise, full of laughter and peace. There was no line between them, all like brothers born of the same mother.

Above their heads was a blue sky, the sun illuminating the fields. The women released the chickens and sheep with peace of mind.

Little Mao opened her small mouth and sang:

"Come! Come! Come! Everyone come together! Regardless of men, women, old or young, pick up hoes and sickles..."

The fat soldier couldn't sit still with laughter and fell to the ground.

### Pastoral Atmosphere

— Chi Qiang

I don’t know why, but recently, I’ve often felt a longing for the countryside.

As a result of this longing, I feel even more reluctant to let go of the countryside; moreover, its 'fragrance becomes clearer the farther away' !

I can't even remember why I left her so cruelly in the first place. Now, I just feel a sense of desolation and loneliness for not smelling the countryside's air even for a day! Although this is just empty sadness, the fact that I have failed her is already beyond words.

Alas! Alas! China! China! Such a vast China, ninety-nine percent of it still lies in the countryside – no matter how much the cities put on airs on your behalf.

It's been another year since I left the lovely countryside under the bright sun; I finally managed to get a small corner of the city, and I presumptuously thought I could live on, but how could I? What was the point, actually?

Therefore, the arrows of guilt are densely concentrated on the target of my heart, and they increase day by day.

Countryside! Although I have been away for a long time; your breath, although it may not necessarily drift over here, however, I know: the teasing, lingering affection, and breath, must still be brewing there; even if there is scorched earth in the way, it still tugs at the traveler's heart.

The golden rapeseed flowers, the wings of the wind winnowed from the wheat heads, all of this, I am a little afraid to mention again – afraid! Because I am afraid that mentioning it will cause me to shed more tears. However, the uncontrollable 'sound of rice threshing carried by the wind under the moon' floats to my mind again! Although I use three-dimensional buildings to disperse all of this, and let streamlined cars carry it away, I am still caught off guard by the crescent moon in the sky on the seventh evening of the month, which still constantly mocks the traveler's incomplete heart, and also casts many eerie shadows.

The air of the countryside, I can't smell it.

Here, unfolds a wave of people chasing the tide, a batch goes by, and a new batch comes again. True, their shoetips, their hemlines, still bring the dust of the countryside, and even permeate the air of the countryside. But, do you think you can rely on this little bit to comfort your withered heart? No, definitely not; it will disappear immediately.

This disappearance, is probably due to the dryness. But the anemic vegetable roots can still be bitten, although the electrocuted vegetables and fruits, are also worth chewing on, aren't they? Don't believe it, vitamins X, Y, Z, all adapt to the needs of the environment and become particularly 'full of divergent opinions'! Although 'no one can agree', one still has to enthusiastically shout: 'This is the food of mankind!' The carp that has climbed the Dragon Gate – actually 'retreated halfway back to the court' – stares blankly, its white eyes fixed, although it still has a bit of the 'remaining power that shakes the different tribes', but its fins and scales are straight, allowing people to pull open its worrisome gills, and it can't spit out any bubbles necessary for life, and it 'collapses' on the vegetable vendor's stall! This is truly a wonderful exotic landscape.

I am suffocating, I can't breathe in fresh air, let's go back, let's go back. What am I doing messing around here.

### Entering the City (Part 2)

— Ding Di

"I'll go home and get it."

"It's getting late! I heard that they changed the city gate closing time to five o'clock today, earlier, huh, what would you know?"

"Isn't it because the foreign bridge on the highway at Dakanzi was burned down by the guerrillas? I know a little."

A group of us抢着问：

"What? Didn't the guerrillas run away long ago – they just set up the kerosene, and were driven away by ××, didn't they run away early?"

The old man搶先回答：

"You don't know, the people of Dakanzi are brave enough! They are all heroes! The guerrillas went, I heard, four of them, they had told the heroes in the village long ago, that they would destroy that bridge, ×× didn't know the guerrillas went, and there were also people from the village. The heroes will do the guerrillas' work for them. As soon as ×× left, hundreds of hands piled up more than a dozen barrels of kerosene, and a foreign bridge, just finished, they are really united."

I試探地问：

"Such a good bridge, isn't it a pity to burn it down!"

The old man and the young man搖搖頭, 異口同聲地說

"It's good to burn it down! Now the bridge is not ours, their trucks, tanks, drive back and forth all day, passing over that bridge, loading soldiers, loading bullets, killing us, what do we need this bridge for?"

The sparks of anger burst out on the faces of two innocent people, making me feel sad, touched, and respectful.

那年轻的小伙激動地，張開粗的手臂，告訴我們說：

"The four guerrillas who went to Dakanzi were really brave! They stood up to ××'s patrol, and deceived them with a few pistols. Four people! Only four people! Did such a big thing! I heard that one of them, got a bullet in his arm, that's so pitiful! I don't know if he's crippled or not?..."

I secretly pushed 老張, I smiled mysteriously, 老王 and 老林 also smiled at him. 老張呢,嘻开鲸鱼嘴, 扁着嘴对我们笑. I think, greater pain is逼着我们, he should forget the smaller pain, right.

松树林那边，发出喜悦的声音来了。嗤嗤牙牙！嗤嗤牙牙！酒鬼王三的一张酒糟脸，挺在树干旁边。费劲转了一转，车给推上大路了

We 埋怨他：

"You drank too much wine! So drunk you can't even walk! We've been waiting for you for a long time!"

"Alas! How could I drink wine today, doing such an important thing? I wanted to do this myself, risking my head! (He pointed to his own head, but when he saw the old man and the young man, he suddenly became忌讳了) It's not that I couldn't catch up, it's because the wheel脱了毂, just fixed it."

We are again 开始作神圣的鬥士了.

装做不认识酒鬼，分成两批，我们这一夥：老張 and 老林; 老王 and I.

We 在六尺高的沙袋旁，忍耐着气忿对××摘下帽子, 鞠一鞠躬.

那木笼，一共三个。××都不站在笼里。他们指指我们的膀臂, 问我们多大年岁: 我们回答了; 望望那「膏药」, 我们通过了.

We 一夥, 四个人, 进城了.

接着那酒鬼的车儿来了—嗤嗤—牙牙…

"检查吗?"

"翻得儘够了. 哈哈! 有什么好翻呢? —一袋米, 两袋米!"

We 笑得打哈哈.

我们的朋友迎接着我们, 我们兴奋极啦! 手互相紧紧握着. I told them 大坎子洋桥给烧了的事, they were so happy they shed tears.

他们也告诉我们一个好消息, 在今天已有十辆小车傢伙进城了.

而且他们握着我们底手说——

祝你们平安进城!"

是的, 我们进城了. 黑漆的地狱将会透起红亮的火光, 在明天.

### A Gathering of Stars on the Sea – Miscellaneous Writings on the New Year's Eve Entertainers' Gathering

— Bing Du

It was an unprecedented event in the entertainment industry. All Shanghai filmmakers collectively participated in a singing broadcast gathering held by the Xinxin Radio Station on New Year's Eve to raise funds for refugee adoption. Perhaps you heard it on the radio, but you only heard their voices from the air. You wouldn't easily know the lively dynamics and humor of the silver stars at the radio station at that time, which was quite interesting.

The so-called star reception area was on the second floor, with a long row of square tables arranged in the tea room. If anyone could peek through the elevator or the glass door of the restaurant, they would have a full view of the stars, because rooms and wine cellars on New Year's Eve are not easy to temporarily occupy. Attracted by a small white paper sign "Star Rest Area", "Look at the stars!" surprised many diners and travelers. Some fans took this flying opportunity to ask the waiter for a piece of white paper and asked her or them to sign it, and of course, the ones who couldn't make it in time were still women.

At seven o'clock, Zheng Xiaoqiu, Huang Huaisheng, Wang Yangqiao and other staff members appeared in the rest area. Soon, Meng He arrived, followed by Lan Gen. This was definitely one of the earliest groups.

The earliest female stars were Xi Qiuqia and Hu Rongrong, accompanied by Xin Ling and her elderly father. At 7:45, filmmakers arrived one after another. Mei Lu, Bai Yan, Wang Lan, Zhang Wan, Wang Yin, Tan Ying... The stars were shining, and the Xinxin Tea Room became a Chang'e Palace and a Crystal Palace.

This time, the most eye-catching was the South China film queen Chen Yunshang. Wearing a red Western-style dress, with her palm-colored skin and healthy, petite Southern physique, she gave people the feeling of Dolores del Río. Under the introduction of Tong Yuejuan, she was very gentle and quiet, without any vanity, superficiality, or arrogance.

Because of her, being hired by Paramount to go to Hollywood to continue Huang Liushuang (Anna May Wong) as the only artist from the motherland active in the film city, it will inevitably have some impact on international visibility and artistic introduction. In addition to paying tribute to this rare artist, we should also strictly conduct a friendly review. However, although it was a brief meeting, due to being too busy with the New Year's Eve gathering, there was no time to talk more and understand her. However, in an ordinary social gathering, her gentle smile and humble silence were the best way to socialize in an unfamiliar gathering, leaving a good impression. I think she understands her position very well. I am not against loving beauty, but under the natural skin of Cai Jin, Wang Renmei, Yuan Meiyun, etc., it aroused a sense of vulgarity in heavy makeup. That day, I couldn't find any extravagant and vain bad habits among the stars, but I couldn't avoid occasional superficial feelings.

Tan Ying was mute, so she brought a record, but in the end she had to speak. Jin Lu wore a short coat and sang a majestic song with Mei Lu. Chen Yunshang is from Guangdong, but she can sing Peking opera, and her Mandarin and English are both good. At nine o'clock, the unprecedented grand occasion began in Studio 406, with social leaders and film industry tycoons. Only the calm, and 群洪警铃 remained in the tea room. All the people went upstairs.

The weather was so cold, but Room 406 was crowded with fifty or sixty people. The radiator seemed to be extracting everyone's sweat twice as much. Fortunately, there were two guards at the door, like iron men, blocking the surging crowd. Phones rang like a string of pearls, asking for photos, requesting conversations, requesting songs... It was a pity that the telephone wasn't equipped with a thousand units, and the stars couldn't spare themselves.

At twelve o'clock, the stars dispersed.

### Snippets from the Film World

— Yin Jiao

Chen Yunshang Has Already Set the Marriage Alliance

The ancient costume film "Mulan Joins the Army" starring Chen Yunshang is scheduled to start filming today at the Huaxin Studio in Triangle Land (the original site of Lianhua Factory). The script of "Mulan Joins the Army" is from the hand of a famous playwright staying in Hong Kong, so the structure and consciousness of the story are quite sound. Zhang Shankun brought the story script back from Hong Kong last time, and the act-by-act dialogue script was brought by Chen Yunshang this time. The male lead of "Mulan Joins the Army" is determined to be Mei Xi, and it is expected to be completed in a month and a half. After that, Chen Yunshang will continue to act in another film, and then return to Hong Kong. It is said that after marrying the son of Chen Weizhou, she will go abroad to the United States. The son of Chen Weizhou and Chen Yunshang have already set 臂之盟; Chen Yunshang has a streamlined car in Hong Kong, which is a betrothal gift from Chen Weizhou's son. Chen Yunshang and Chen Weizhou's son are both surnamed Chen, and were one family 500 years ago, and will become one family again 500 years later, which is also a good story.

Yuan Meiyun's Finger with a New Diamond Ring

Yuan Meiyun used to buy a diamond ring for 800 yuan and wear it on her finger, shining brightly, and looking very good. Recently, the diamond ring on Yuan Meiyun's finger has been replaced with a new one! It turns out that Yuan Meiyun recently received a large sum of money, which she obtained from Yihua Film Company; Yihua Company has included "The Three Incarnations Girl" directed by Fang Peilin and starring Yuan Meiyun in this year's production schedule, and is preparing to start filming in the bright spring. Fang Peilin and Yuan Meiyun are now both employees of Xinhua Company. After Yihua's young owner Yan Youxiang borrowed from Xinhua, he obtained Zhang Shankun's consent. At the same time, Yihua prepaid a sum of money to Yuan Meiyun, so Yuan Meiyun exchanged the original diamond ring and bought a new diamond ring with larger particles and more brilliance, for a price of 1,500 yuan. From this, it can also be seen how luxurious Yuan Meiyun's life has been recently.

### Chess Garden Announcement

Recently, we have received letters from readers, saying that Chinese chess is one of the national quintessence, but the entertainment industry alone does not have it, which is regrettable! Please add this section to help readers entertain themselves. We think that chess is a very ancient thing, and all countries in the East and West respect it. According to our country, the poem "Summoning the Soul" in the "Chu Ci" already has the sentence "菎蔽象基，有六簿些". As for the current Chinese chess, it is said to have originated from Niu Sengru, the Prime Minister of the Tang Dynasty. Later, there were famous masters in each dynasty, engaging in intrigue and creating the same score to benefit future generations, which became a grand sight. However, although the records are comprehensive, there is still room for innovation. If we lay out the game every day and disclose it in the newspaper for enthusiasts to study together, it would also be an elegant thing. Therefore, we have invited Mr. Bao Zibo to take on the responsibility of editing this garden. The gentleman is well-versed in chess and has been in the chess world for many years, known as a master. It is now scheduled to publish endgame puzzles on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, opening tactics on Thursdays and Fridays, and full-board games on Saturdays. We hope that colleagues at home and abroad will provide guidance at any time, so as to collect ideas and achieve mutual benefit, which would be very fortunate.

### Liyuan Compilation and Information

Gu Wuwei Has Shares in the Renewal Information

Gu Wuwei, the owner of the Hong Kong Standard Troupe, has come to Shanghai. His whereabouts are mysterious. According to reports, Gu is currently in contact with the Renewal Stage, intending to invest 10,000 yuan in shares. If it can become a reality, the Standard Troupe will come to Shanghai for performances. However, Gu himself told reporters that the troupe is currently affiliated with the Hong Kong Lee Theatre and cannot leave for the time being. If there is an opportunity to come to Shanghai, it would be a permanent solution, which is what he wishes. Negotiations were held with the Tianchan Stage a month ago, but they did not succeed.

Peng Youchen Arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the Night Before Last

Peng Youchen, the manager of the Nanjing Central Grand Stage, arrived in Shanghai by car the night before last. Yesterday, he visited Liu Fenghai, the stage design director at the Xinji Grand Stage, for discussions. The purpose of Peng's visit is to visit his family members in Shanghai and to find talent for the Central Stage. The results of his activities will be explored and recorded later.

Xiao San Mazi Continues to Perform at the Tianchan Stage

The news that the famous actor Xiao San Mazi was negotiating with the Tianchan Stage for continued performance conditions has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to Xiao Ling, he has agreed with the front stage the night before last to continue performing until the end of the year at the agreed-upon price of 20 days of performance per month. As for what will happen next spring, it will be decided after the closing.

The Gong Stage's New Play Will Be Performed on the 6th

The 28th episode of "Hongyun Temple" which is being rehearsed at the Gong Stage, had promotional photos taken the night before last. It will be fully rehearsed tonight and tomorrow night. It was originally scheduled to be performed on the 4th, but due to the rush to produce new colorful stage scenery, there was not enough time, so it was postponed to the night show on Friday (the 6th). The actors of the troupe are studying the singing, acting, and expressions in the play with great diligence.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (6) (3)

— Xu Muyun

Yu Shuyan Visited More Than Ten Famous Teachers

Indeed, no matter which famous actor, they are all tempered from hardship. Lao Tan's success has been said in detail a few days ago. After Lao Tan, the leading role of the male actors is of course Yu Shuyan. Speaking of the various difficulties that Shuyan encountered when learning his art, it is enough to make some of the lucky and successful bearded actors feel ashamed. The beginning and end of Shuyan's apprenticeship with Lao Tan has been discussed in this article, but before and after he joined the Tan family, there are many famous teachers he consulted, which seem to have to be mentioned. When he performed everywhere under the stage name of Little Yu Sansheng, that was just the artistic ability of ordinary child actors. After his voice went bad, he often visited various theaters, and he met many experts. The famous Chunyang Friendship Association in the old capital was full of talent, and Shuyan was also a member. At that time, Chen Twelve (Yan Heng) and Wang Junzhi were both famous amateur actors in Tianjin and Beijing who studied Tan's art. They had good knowledge and were very particular about the pronunciation, so these two gentlemen can be regarded as lay teachers who instructed Shuyan in singing and reciting the pronunciation. In addition, there was an old celebrity, Wei Gong, who had in-depth research on Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera. He was active in the singing world for about decades, and listened to countless famous actors and excellent plays. He also gave special attention to Shuyan. This is considered his good teacher and helpful friend in asking for words and discussing drama. As for the famous teachers in the professional world, in addition to Lao Tan, Zhu Tianxiang, Qian Jinfu, etc. were the teachers who taught him the stage combat, posture, and weapons; Wang Changlin and Chen Delin were the teachers who told him about body movements, gestures, etc.; Qian, Chen, and Wang, the three elders, were not only outstanding figures in the Jing, Dan, and Chou lines, but also senior actors who had been playing with Lao Tan for a long time. Therefore, dramas such as "Dingjun Mountain", "Zhulianshan", "Wujiapo", "Visiting Mother", "Fenhe Bay", "South Tianmen", "Beating the Stick Out of the Box", and "Heavenly Thunder Report", which were co-performed by Sheng Jing, Sheng Dan, and Sheng Chou, were almost all told to him by these three old court worshipers. (Professionals call teaching drama "telling drama", such as saying that a certain drama was told to me by someone.)

### Discussing the Automotive Transportation Industry

— Ding Zuze

The automotive transportation industry in America has been around for twenty years since its inception. Although its history is shorter compared to other transportation industries, its development has been rapid, surpassing others to take the lead. Currently, the total number of transport vehicles in the United States, according to reliable estimates, has reached a huge figure of 568,000. The number of employees is one million, which is even more than the number of workers in the American railway transportation industry. This illustrates the vast scale of this industry.

The automotive transportation industry can be divided into long-distance and short-distance. Long-distance routes can reach up to seven hundred miles. In the western United States, some routes are around one thousand miles. The operating conditions are quite satisfactory under certain circumstances. Regardless of whether the transportation company is for long-distance or short-distance, its business operations can generally be divided into two types: one is based on contracts with fixed prices and regular schedules, and the other is based on having fixed prices without fixed delivery schedules.

To meet the needs of modern cities, the automotive transportation industry is becoming more developed. Ships and trains arriving or departing at ports all require vehicles for transshipment. The timely distribution of food, the allocation of industrial products, the demolition and construction of buildings, and the movement of large objects all require transport vehicles. Automotive transportation has now surpassed railway transportation, with the ratio being 46% for railway freight and 54% for automotive freight. Short-distance freight transport within 250 miles is particularly thriving, increasing eight times more than long-distance freight transport.

In the United States, long-distance automotive transportation companies with routes of 250 miles or more are large in scale. The loading and unloading of goods follow railway methods. Despite owning a large number of vehicles, they are still able to make a profit. Some argue that large-scale companies are not suitable for operating long-distance transportation.

The reasons why automotive transportation is popular and so well-developed are varied. According to a survey of 35,468 merchants, the reasons can be listed as follows:

Reason　Percentage of Merchants

Fast transportation……65

Direct delivery to the store……65

Low overall freight costs……53

Loading at the store……51

More flexible and convenient……43

Cheaper packaging……21

Shorter notification time……21

Simpler freight rate classification……16

Fewer cargo losses and damages……11

Personal friendship and interest……3

From the table above, it is clear that the main reason for welcoming automotive transportation is its speed. According to statistics, the average speed of automotive transportation is 15 miles per hour, while it is 5 miles for railways, 1-3 miles for waterways, and 1-5 miles for pipeline transport (most of the kerosene and crude oil produced by American oil mines are transported to refineries in distant mining areas through large pipes). From this, it can be seen that the speed of automotive transportation is three times faster than that of railways.

Another advantage of automotive transportation is that the selection of endpoints is not as restricted as railways or ports. On the contrary, its endpoints are very flexible. As for the endpoints of large companies' automotive routes, there are also facilities such as driver dormitories, manager offices, and repair shops.

In ordinary transport vehicles, the engine is in front of the driver's seat, i.e., the driver's seat is three feet behind the front of the vehicle. Now, new transport vehicles have a high-head design, where the driver's seat is above the engine (similar to the vehicles of the Shanghai Chinese Public Bus Company). This has many advantages. Because the driver's seat is moved above the engine, the view is greatly improved. The driver has a wide field of vision, even in crowded downtown areas, can operate accurately. The cargo-carrying area is also increased by at least three feet compared to the old style. Secondly, the load weight is evenly distributed on the front and rear axles, resulting in more economical driving.

The use of trailers in automotive transportation is also gradually increasing. There are many benefits to using trailers. When the trailer is being loaded or unloaded, the truck can tow other trailers or go to the repair shop for repairs without hindering the loading and unloading of goods. The manufacturing of trailers is now very sophisticated. The mechanisms for connecting them to trucks are easy to install and remove. Even the driver does not need to get out of the vehicle to automatically detach the trailer. There is also a type of semi-trailer (the rear half of the trailer is equipped with axles, while the front half rests on the rear axle of the truck. After detaching from the truck, it can stand firmly on the ground using the support legs installed on the front half). Because it can be towed by a small truck with less horsepower, its number is also very large, especially suitable for driving on flat ground, which can greatly increase the load. The safety equipment of the new semi-trailers is particularly commendable. Even if it accidentally detaches from the truck during driving, it can automatically lower the support legs and stop automatically, preventing the danger of overturning or collision.

"It is not easy to obtain the operating accounts and cost accounting materials of the American automotive transportation industry, as companies do not keep detailed accounts. Some are too busy with operations and do not have enough time to keep records, while others only calculate the total annual income and expenses to conclude a certain surplus. As for the accounting of large-scale companies, although it is more detailed, it is still insufficient in terms of classification and statistics. Therefore, it is difficult to investigate which vehicles and machinery are beneficial and which are uneconomical, so as to provide a basis for future selection. Therefore, the figures listed in this article are only for reference and cannot be taken as the whole picture."

A large automotive transportation company operates a gasoline engine truck on a 200-mile route. It travels a total of 80,000 miles per year, carrying 20 tons per trip, at a total cost of $17,493. The cost per mile is 22.2 cents. Another similar truck operates on a 400-mile route, traveling a total of 96,000 miles per year, at a total cost of $19,657. The cost per mile is less than 22.2 cents.

According to a survey in California, the gasoline consumption of highway transport vehicles can be listed as follows:

(Note) This refers to the American gallon, which is approximately four-fifths of the British gallon or 3.75 liters.

The numbers listed above cannot be compared because their routes are limited to within the area and those that travel long distances.

There are even various statistics that attempt to prove that automotive transportation is more expensive than railway transportation at a certain mileage. However, it is generally recognized that automotive transportation is economical for mileages of 250 to 300 miles. However, the long-distance automotive transportation business of 700 to 1,000 miles is booming.

The taxes collected by the American government from the automotive transportation industry each year will surely exceed $1 billion. According to the US Bureau of Statistics, in 1935, there were only 61,216 transport vehicle companies and 188,809 trucks, and the tax collected was $530,860,000. The number of vehicles only accounted for one-third of the total this year.

In summary, although the American automotive transportation industry is burdened by heavy taxes and faces strong competition from the railway industry, its contributions are significant. Reducing unemployment, promoting transportation convenience, and indirectly promoting the progress of automotive engineering are all undeniable facts.

### The 25th Anniversary of Double Celebrations: China Motors and the New Dodge

— Qiao Yun

Feixing and Dongfang Motor Companies, which started operating in Shanghai and Central China in 1914, are the predecessors of the American-owned China Motors. Therefore, the establishment of China Motors has now reached twenty-five years. The Dodge passenger cars and transport vehicles exclusively managed by the company also made their debut at the time of the company's initial establishment. Therefore, the year 1939 is also the 25th anniversary of the double celebration of the company's establishment and the sale of Dodge cars in China. What the company and Dodge factory are most proud of today, twenty-five years later, is that China Motors has achieved great success in Shanghai and Central China. At the same time, the phrase "Dodge is the most reliable" has become a well-known idiom worldwide.

The past twenty-five years have not only been a very important period for the automotive industry, but also the most developed period for highway construction in China. The construction of highways in China has been short, but its progress has been very rapid. In recent years, the convenience of transportation and transportation within China is far better than in the past, and most of it must be attributed to the construction of highways.

Highway transportation relies on automobiles as an indispensable tool. To facilitate travel and reduce transportation costs, automobiles are essential. In this regard, China Motors has made considerable contributions. In addition to providing Dodge products with excellent quality, outstanding performance, absolute reliability, and reasonable prices for all sectors to purchase, it has also established multiple branches in Central China, based on years of experience, to provide loyal service. Its contribution to enhancing and maintaining highway efficiency is significant.

Mr. V. J. B. Hulladn, the Acting General Manager of China Motors, told people that the 1939 New Dodge commercial vehicles and transport vehicles are a masterpiece to commemorate the silver anniversary. Therefore, whether in terms of appearance, internal equipment, operating performance, economic efficiency, or any other aspect, its reliability is even better than previous products.

The photo shows the office of China Motors (taken by Ye Changlie). The photo shows the exterior of the new Dodge truck factory. The factory is located in northern Detroit, USA, covering an area of 49 acres, specializing in the manufacture of half-ton to three-ton commercial vehicles.
