Editorial

### Clear Military Dynamics

The recent Chinese military offensive in central China has various implications. One of its purposes is to contain the Japanese army, preventing it from transferring more troops to fight in southern Guangxi, and then trapping the Japanese army in isolated Nanning, leading to its destruction. Therefore, from a military perspective, the "winter offensive" touted by the Japanese is not a full-scale counteroffensive. However, the activity of Chinese troops in various regions has dealt a major blow to the Japanese, and it does have important value in the overall war situation. The fact that the Japanese army has been unable to advance for a year after occupying Wuhan has doomed it to failure. As General Chen Cheng explained in the context of Chinese history of war, "It is easy to go from north to south, but it is usually extremely difficult to go from east to west, so the Shanghai war determined the first step in the failure of the Japanese". Although Japan used great effort to gain Wuhan, it has always failed to control the "upper reaches" of Jingxiang and the "right arm" of Xiangyang. The May attack on northern Hubei resulted in a crushing defeat in northern Hubei, and the October attack on Changsha resulted in a crushing defeat in northern Hunan. Having learned these two lessons, it adopted a defensive posture in central China and attempted to develop toward Guangdong and Guangxi. From scattered news from various sources, we can conclude that Japan's invasion of Guangxi is being carried out with all its strength. Therefore, the center of gravity of the overall war has also shifted to the south. In other words, the focus of future wars will be in southern China, not central China. After Japan captured Nanning, the military spokesperson in Tokyo stated that Japan's military operations in southern China would not end with Nanning, "Because the Japanese army is determined to eliminate the southwest's blood supply artery", that is, to cut off the Dian-Vietnam Railway and the Dian-Burma Highway, to stop China's international transportation, and to prevent the transportation of Chinese military supplies. In addition, Japan believes that by penetrating into Guangxi, it can threaten the border of French Vietnam and advance its political goals from the side. The Japanese believed that the French's fear could be used to great advantage, and that Britain and France were like chickens tied together, hoping that Britain and France could jointly pressure China as a result. However, the facts clearly answered Japan, and this attempt failed. However, his actions like this will not end with such a failure, and there will inevitably be other attempts in the future, which will emerge endlessly with military offensives. What is already visible is his rumor offensive. The purpose of this offensive, I am afraid, is as the American Apender said: "Now Japan's hope of victory is not pinned on military action, but on her estimate of Chinese national character, Japan still hopes that internal political disputes can be caused in China to replace the current united will of resistance". Because she wants to shatter China's will to resist and seek political gains, she releases all kinds of rumors, saying how the generals of Guangxi are doing, how the generals of Yunnan are doing, and his military actions also want to cooperate with this political offensive, trying to open up Guangxi and approach Yunnan and Guizhou, so as to achieve the goal of winning without war. But this attempt only sees her heart is exhausted and her skills are poor. It is credible that today's China, there is no general who does not take unity against insults as his creed, and there is no general who does not take the will of their leader as his will. Retreating halfway is destruction, this concept is deeply imprinted in the minds of all Chinese soldiers. China's only unchanging policy today is that China will continue to resist as long as Japan does not give up its aggression, and it is necessary to strike the aggressors and achieve final victory. Strengthening defensive forces in southern China, so that Japan's political and military attempts cannot progress, this goal, China has already achieved, Chinese and Japanese troops are holding each other between Yong and Bin. In the central Hubei area of central China, the Chinese army crossed the Xiang River, recovered Duobao Bay, Luohan Temple, and Xiantao Town, cutting off the Jingzhong, Han-Yue, Xiang-Hua roads, and has the potential to attack Zhongxiang and raid Suixian. In southern Hubei, there is a situation of attacking Tongcheng and encircling Yueyang. In eastern Hubei, it is approaching Wuxue and Qichun. In northern Jiangxi, it crossed the Fu River and advanced towards Nanchang. In southern Henan, it is advancing towards Xinyang. In short, China's military progress in central China can remotely contain and shatter the Japanese army's attempt to concentrate its efforts to attack southern Guangxi, and can also accumulate small victories into big victories, so as to promote the overall collapse of the Japanese army's aggressive actions in China.

### Explanation by Speaker Jiang of the National Political Council on the Understanding Necessary for Implementing Constitutional Government

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Not only do they not hinder each other, but they are mutually dependent. I believe that political tutelage should be actively carried out not only during the period of political tutelage, but constitutional government does not necessarily have to begin on the day the political tutelage completely ends. This is something everyone can understand from the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. In other words, implementing constitutional government as soon as possible is precisely the purpose of our revolution and does not violate the policies of our party. At the same time, only by truly striving for the work of training the people can we firmly lay the foundation for our constitutional rule. Therefore, on the one hand, we demand the implementation of constitutional government, and on the other hand, after the promulgation of the constitution, we must continue the unfinished work of political tutelage.

(Two) The specific work of so-called political tutelage is, of course, to implement local self-government and train the people to exercise the four powers. However, the meaning of political tutelage is to train the people to have the qualifications to shoulder national politics. This task, especially after thousands of years of autocratic and corrupt politics, is a difficult and huge task that cannot be completed overnight given China's backwardness in economy and culture. I believe that even if the constitution is promulgated as early as possible, everyone must not ignore the painstaking efforts of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in setting the period of political tutelage. All the wise and talented people in the country, especially those who lead the people, must be enthusiastic and active, and bear the heavy responsibility of political tutelage with public spirit and sincerity. Even after the promulgation of the constitution in the future, we still cannot abandon the work of political tutelage. I believe that political tutelage is not necessarily the responsibility of the Kuomintang alone, but a common obligation of those who are enthusiastic about national affairs. I believe that the meaning of political tutelage is not only that the government trains the people, but also that the people train themselves, and that people's opinions institutions at all levels supervise the government and train the government. After the establishment of people's opinions institutions at all levels, their position is, on the one hand, to represent the people and express public opinion, and on the other hand, to supervise the government, that is, to train the government. The government and people's opinions institutions are not opposed to each other. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Politics is the management of the public." Those in people's opinions institutions can work in the government tomorrow, and especially at the local level, every people's representative must participate in local public undertakings at the same time in people's opinions institutions. Therefore, an attitude of mutual trust and mutual respect should be cultivated, a relationship of shared honor and shared disgrace should be recognized, and a habit of helping each other should be cultivated. Regarding this point, we, as members of this council, should take the lead in leading the people of the country. We must recognize the importance of our own position and respect our own powers. In the midst of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, none of our words can violate the Three Principles of the People that we have all sworn to follow, nor can they violate the outline for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction that we have all agreed upon. Otherwise, our every word and action will have no credibility or effect in front of the people. Furthermore, we must all not want to repeat the old habits of past parliaments. Therefore, in criticizing the government's performance in governance, we must adopt a positive and well-intentioned attitude, and base it on law and facts, not on rumors and malicious slanderous stories, and casually make accusations. Now we have decided to promulgate the constitution on a regular basis. Today's National Political Council is the beginning of establishing a sound constitutional government for the future. Not only should this council serve as a good model, but it should also serve as a model for the general public today. We must be aware that we have the responsibility of mentoring and protecting the people and cultivating constitutional rule.

(Three) The effectiveness of the implementation of constitutional government does not lie in the articles and forms of the constitution, but in possessing the spirit of constitutional rule. China already had a constitutional scale of people discussing and participating in politics in the Three Dynasties. Since the Republic of China, there have been even more promulgations of provisional laws and constitutions, and the establishment of the Senate and the House of Representatives. But how much contribution has this constitution and this parliament ultimately made to the practical interests of the Chinese nation and people? It can be said that it has only been harmful and not beneficial to the nation and the people. Among the colleagues present today, some have participated in the former parliament, and some have been arrested and imprisoned and sacrificed everything for the sake of doctrine and the constitution. Everyone must have many feelings about the past history of parliament. Why do we have the same constitution and the same parliament, but we cannot benefit the country? Why has our national affairs become increasingly corrupt and chaotic, and today we have to suffer such invasion and humiliation from enemy countries? After the establishment of the National Government, I, from the position of the Kuomintang, must, of course, admit the responsibility I should bear for national affairs and foreign troubles. During the Beiyang government era, I am not saying that the Yuan, Xu, Cao, and Duan governments had no faults, but our parliament at that time really cannot but bear a great responsibility. I believe that since the Republic of China, our constitution and parliament have had no foundation. The constitution is hypocritical and does not meet the needs of the country, the parliament does not understand its own responsibilities to the country and the people, and the parliamentarians themselves cannot respect the duties and moral obligations that people's representatives should have. Dr. Sun Yat-sen devoted himself to the national revolution and personally drafted the Outline of National Reconstruction, so he stipulated political tutelage, precisely because based on these facts and lessons, he believed that in order to produce a sound constitutional government and create a truly people-owned, people-governed, and people-enjoyed country, it is necessary to go through the stage of political tutelage. Now we examine the national situation internally and observe the environment externally. Since we want to implement constitutional government early, we must treat the root cause. I believe that the biggest problem with our parliament in the past was that we forgot the inherent spirit of our Chinese nation. What is our inherent spirit? It is the four words (propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame). In modern terms, propriety is order, righteousness is responsibility, integrity is respect for others, and shame is respect for oneself. This is consistent with the meaning of the three sentences in our ancient saying (be respectful in conduct, be respectful in work, and be loyal to others). In the past, our people ignored this meaning, did not know how to abide by the law, be responsible, respect others, and respect themselves. Then it is no wonder that they relied on their position to delay national affairs, and as a result, desecrated the dignity of constitutional government and deepened the suffering of the people. Today, we must recognize that our implementation of constitutional rule is to establish a long-term plan for the country. The question is not whether constitutional rule is implemented too early, but whether we have the sincerity to create a true constitutional government for the country. If everyone has this sincerity, we may as well promulgate the constitution before the completion of political tutelage, and at the same time, we can still implement the spirit of political tutelage, on the one hand, train the people and improve their understanding of national responsibilities and national politics, and on the other hand, train the government to improve the efficiency of politics at all levels. At the last meeting, I once said to you that our councilors should take on our responsibilities with the spirit of Yi Yin teaching Tai Jia and the Duke of Zhou teaching King Cheng. We not only use this spirit to teach the people, but also use this spirit to assist the government. The "teaching" of political tutelage originally did not have the meaning of being condescending. The word "teaching" in political tutelage is not scolding, but guidance, like a school tutor, patiently guiding students, putting themselves in their shoes to teach students, guiding them upwards, and not like an arrogant master, scolding servants condescendingly, making them embarrassed. Therefore, whether it is supervision or criticism, it is always well-intentioned guidance, not passive blame. Taking the precedents of Yi Yin teaching Tai Jia, the Duke of Zhou teaching King Cheng, and Zhuge Liang assisting the Later Lord, they themselves first had a spirit of public loyalty and responsibility, and an attitude of reverence and respect. Just like loyal ministers in history, standing in the court with righteous expressions, even if they were honest and outspoken, unwilling to compromise, they must straighten their clothes, straighten their appearance, and be dignified and solemn, as if facing important matters. This is the modern spirit of responsibility and discipline, and it is also the good habit of self-respect and respect for the personality of others in many democratic countries. Because China's politics and education have declined, this inherent national spirit has been lost. The habits of modern constitutional rule have also achieved nothing. The general public and young people are accustomed to frivolousness and carelessness in everything. I cannot hope that every citizen can reverse the decline in one day, but I sincerely hope that our colleagues in the National Political Council will put these meanings into practice and set a good example for the people, that is, to cultivate the foundation for implementing true constitutional government for the country. Finally, there is one more point that I do not hesitate to repeat to my colleagues. Because I am eager for the early completion of our revolutionary and national reconstruction cause, and I am eager for our country to implement constitutional government as soon as possible, have the scale of a modern country, and establish a foundation for survival, development, long-term stability, and security, I often think deeply about why our national affairs are so chaotic and disorganized and can never get on the right track. I feel that the evolution of political education in our Chinese history is very different before and after the Qin and Han dynasties. During the Zhou dynasty, we had a perfect parliamentary system, a complete administrative organization, and a military and political organization. We even implemented the well-field system and the Principle of People's Livelihood, and there was a concrete and subtle realization of social economy, without monopoly, oppression, inequality, and unfair phenomena. Everything in politics and society was orderly. Why did it decline day by day until today, with the phenomenon of chaos and decline, national weakness, and people's poverty, and encounter such serious foreign troubles? I have repeatedly thought deeply about the reason, and I believe that this is not only due to the loss of government and education after the Qin and Han dynasties, and the minority rulers and gentry stealing and establishing authority and exploiting the rights of the people, but also because before the Zhou dynasty, we used propriety as the outline of the rule of law, and social organization as the foundation of political organization. At that time, everything was organized and trained. Whether it was school, the army, society, or the family, the most important thing was to emphasize propriety, righteousness, and order. All citizens could not evade responsibilities and obligations, not only legal, but also moral. Because of this, the politics of the Zhou dynasty could be so prosperous. If we want to carry out revolution and build a country in the future, we must grasp this key point. We must know that no matter how complete the constitution and other laws are, if there are no people who enforce the law, abide by the law, and actively take responsibility for the country, these fundamental laws will become a mere scrap of paper and will not help national affairs in the slightest. We are not afraid of failing to win the War of Resistance or failing to build a country, but we are afraid of failing to restore the inherent spirit of our nation that values propriety and abides by the law. That is the real danger to our country's future. All colleagues must not think that these words of mine are empty and pedantic. In fact, this is the key to the rise and fall and survival of our nation. I hope that all colleagues will lead by example and lead the people to promote our inherent national spirit. In this way, we will surely be able to obtain the practical results of constitutional government, create more solid unity, more solid strength, and be able to assume our arduous responsibilities and achieve our sacred mission.

### China Closely Watches US-Japan Relations

Chongqing ‚Äì It was closely observed here yesterday of the developments in US-Japan relations. Chinese officials claimed that they "absolutely do not believe" that the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1911, after its expiration next month, would allow ordinary commerce between Japan and the US to continue as normal. This is because they believed that this move went beyond "diplomatic posturing." However, they warned the US to carefully consider the significance of past promises made by Japan. They believe that Japan's decision to reopen the Yangtze River cannot be regarded as a concession to the US, because Japan has no legal right to block the river. Officials pointed to the opening of the Yangtze River as "bait from Japan, and the promises made by Japan can be broken by Japan at any time." Therefore, they "hope that the US will not be misled by Japan and accept this step, lest they regret it in the future." (United Press International telegram from the 25th)

### Various Circles in Yunnan Province Hold Public Banquet for Myanmar Delegation Visiting China

Kunming ‚Äì The Myanmar delegation visiting China attended a public banquet held by various circles at 8 pm on the 24th. More than 100 guests and hosts attended, and the atmosphere was extremely cordial. During the banquet, Zhang Banghan delivered a speech, expressing welcome and gratitude to the delegation for coming to China during the period of our country's War of Resistance and visiting various places in Chongqing and Chengdu. Then, the leader of the delegation, U Ba Lwin, replied, saying that the delegation had been warmly received in various places in China, which was very appreciated. This visit to Yunnan, especially because Yunnan and Myanmar are adjacent, made them feel even more cordial. China and Myanmar have a long-standing friendship. Now that your country is fighting for peace in the Far East and the world, our two nations should work together to lay the foundation for permanent peace in the Far East. Even the Himalayas cannot isolate our friendship. After the banquet, delegation leader U Ba Lwin and deputy delegation leader Du Miya Xin made speeches to reporters. U Ba Lwin said that this visit to China has witnessed the national spirit of your country's people, like a awakened lion, and the leaders are loyal to the country and supported by the people, leading the work of resisting the war and building the country, and have embarked on the road to rejuvenation, which is very exciting. Although your country is currently suffering great sacrifices due to the War of Resistance, the future achievements will be unlimited, and its mission is like that of the United States in America and the Soviet Union in Europe. Even in terms of this War of Resistance, it is solely responsible for the sacred and great work of peace in the East. Therefore, its success can be predicted. Du Miya Xin said that the Chinese women's movement has penetrated into the countryside, and during this War of Resistance, the contribution of women to the country and the nation is no less than that of men. This element is truly a model for our Myanmar. (Telegram from the 24th)

### Borah Firmly Opposes the Export of US Arms to Japan, but Still Advocates Maintaining US-Japan Commercial Relations

Washington ‚Äì Senator Borah, leader of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met with reporters today and issued a statement saying, "I support efforts to maintain US-Japan commercial relations, but I am firmly opposed to the future export of arms from the United States to Japan." (Haitong telegram from the 25th)

Washington ‚Äì Senator Borah, a staunch isolationist in the United States, repeatedly stated yesterday that he advocated making all reasonable efforts after the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty of 1911 to maintain commercial relations between the two countries. Borah's telegram to Seattle lumber merchant representative Herbert stated that he would continue to oppose the sale of "munitions, arms, or instruments of war." Borah told reporters last night that he believed that US Ambassador to Japan Grew "should handle the situation with good judgment. My telegram should not be interpreted as containing any meaning, not only for commercial interests, but also for the sake of peace in the Far East, we must maintain peaceful trade relations with Japan." Borah stated, "I have no intention of working against China." (United Press International telegram from the 25th)

Tokyo ‚Äì The Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun" commented on the negotiations between Japan and the United States to extend the commercial treaty. The newspaper believes that although there are difficulties in the future of the negotiations, if both parties conduct negotiations with a friendly attitude and a constructive spirit, both parties can expect to reach an agreement. The "Hochi Shimbun" has a more negative attitude, stating that Japan does not object to respecting the open-door policy in China, but the implementation of this principle should be limited to trade and economic activities. As for politics and military affairs, the above principle cannot be applied. For example, Japan's opening of the Yangtze River is entirely for economic activities and has nothing to do with politics and military affairs. (Haitong telegram from the 25th)

### Christmas Day, Roosevelt Broadcasts Speech, Saying US Situation is Uniquely Good and Must Help Others, Pope Negotiates Peace with Related Countries

Washington

President Roosevelt recently delivered a broadcast speech on Christmas Day, saying, "At the beginning of 1939, the world was generally afraid that a great disaster was about to come. Later, the war broke out as expected. Now, at the end of the year, the world has suffered because others do not treat each other with humanity. Some countries are suffering from war and the situation is very pitiful. We alone can live in peace, which can be said to be extremely fortunate. For our sake, we cannot just celebrate, but should sincerely pray to God to give us strength so that we can help others. In other words, we should follow the proverbs given by Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, pray to God, and make other nations also read this immortal treasure and understand its meaning." (Havas telegram from the 24th)

Rome - In a Christmas message to the College of Cardinals, the Pope expressed his thanks to President Roosevelt for his noble and generous efforts to mediate peace, and said that there were other important figures he was in contact with who were also trying to work towards peace, but he did not want to reveal their names. (Reuters telegram from the 15th)

Paris ‚Äì After US President Roosevelt initiated the concentration of spiritual power from the three religions of Catholicism, Christianity, and Judaism to lay the foundation for lasting peace, Pope Pius XII also responded by giving a speech when he met with the Cardinals today. Responsible persons here expressed deep sympathy for the actions of President Roosevelt and the Pope, and said that President Roosevelt's repeated appeals and the diplomatic activities carried out by the Holy See have always been praised by the world. The Pope again condemned the policy of violence in his speech yesterday. The consensus of opinion between the Holy See and the US government can be clearly seen from this. Furthermore, President Roosevelt hopes to work with the Holy See at the appropriate time for lasting and fair peace. This is the first time that the United States and the Holy See have joined hands. His dispatch of Taylor as his personal representative stationed in the Holy See is a unique style of the President. Taylor himself represented the United States at the international conference on the resettlement of German and Austrian refugees in Evian, France, and is currently the chairman of the international committee appointed by the conference.

Yesterday he presented gifts to anti-aircraft gun crews and other soldiers. Last night, after inspecting the Spicheren Heights, Hitler went to inspect various fortresses on the Saarbr√ºcken front line. (Haitong telegram from the 25th)

Berlin ‚Äì General von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, spent Christmas Eve on the Western Front and gave a speech to the troops stationed there, saying, "Comrades, today is the same as twenty-five years ago, we are facing the enemy again and spending a wartime Christmas. Fortresses, barbed wire, battle impressions, and the graves of fallen soldiers are all before our eyes. We celebrate Christmas with no distinction between commanders-in-chief and privates. We are united in spirit and participate in a great war. The great Germany created by Fuehrer Hitler will surely have a day when it is safe. Our families are also celebrating Christmas, which shows that the front line and the rear are both in the same fate and are united. Fuehrer Hitler was also on the front line a few days ago, spending Christmas Eve with the soldiers, and we all express our warm welcome." (Haitong telegram from the 25th)

Berlin ‚Äì German Deputy Fuehrer Hess recently broadcast a Christmas message from a destroyer to Germans around the world, mentioning the German people's love for Hitler, calling Hitler Germany's first soldier, and saying, "The more we love Hitler, the more others hate us, because they all know that our love for the leader is the strength of the country. This war was caused by 'envy of the diligent Germans.' The Allied powers' war aim is to destroy the German nation." (Reuters telegram from the 25th)

Berlin ‚Äì According to news revealed on Christmas Eve, German Fuehrer Hitler has accepted the Sorivo Villa, a gift from Hamburg citizen Sebeque.

### Amidst the Sound of Cannons: Paris Celebrates; Daladier Urges the Nation to Resolutely Resist; Gamelin Also Issues a Message to the Soldiers

Paris - This year, due to the war and air defense, the residents of Paris celebrated Christmas with less fanfare than in previous years. However, churches in the city and its suburbs still held midnight masses yesterday. Hotels, having obtained special permits from the government, continued to operate until 2 a.m. today, enjoying booming business, especially with British and French army officers as their main patrons. To prevent air raids, hotels and entertainment venues were covered with thick curtains to prevent light from escaping, which did somewhat dampen the mood. In addition, a considerable number of army, navy, and air force officers and soldiers took leave to return to Paris to spend the Christmas holidays. These individuals, temporarily away from the front lines, reunited with their families, and their joy can be imagined. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)

Paris - Prime Minister Daladier issued a "Christmas Message to the Nation" this evening, emphasizing that France is fighting for victory and that this Christmas is a Christmas filled with hope. He also urged the nation to resolutely resist in order to defend freedom and independence. He said, "Tonight, I am not speaking as the leader of the government but as a close friend sharing your hardships, engaging in a frank discussion with all my compatriots. It has been nearly four months since Germany ignited the flames of disaster for the entire world. The events that have occurred during these four months are sufficient to prove that all responsibility should be borne by Germany. I recently had the Foreign Ministry's Yellow Book published in a popular edition, so that all compatriots, regardless of their circumstances, can have a copy in hand. The documents collected therein clearly show that the German authorities deliberately plotted to create a war, which cannot be concealed. We are now fighting to defend our homeland, which is true. However, we are still minimizing the sacrifices of our soldiers as much as possible, so that, to date, our military losses have been very small. On this Christmas Eve, I dare to ask my fellow countrymen to temporarily put aside the difficulties we are currently facing and focus on the great future. It should be known that our soldiers and leaders from all walks of life are preparing for the future with unwavering courage. We are fighting for the safety and freedom of your families so that you can all live and work in peace in the future. Consider that, to this day, countless millions of people in other nations across Europe are living in slavery, while we alone are still able to preserve all our rights, both materially and spiritually. Imagine the women and children in Prague, tonight without food or clothing, witnessing the joyous celebrations of foreign invaders, how resentful and disappointed they must be. Consider also the residents of Warsaw mourning on the battlefields and weeping bitterly for their lost freedom and happiness, as well as the Finnish people fighting hard in the frozen wilderness. All of these are lessons to be learned. When we reflect on this, how can we not be filled with righteous indignation? In my opinion, under these circumstances, all my compatriots must resolutely resist to defend their own freedom and independence and to guarantee freedom and the right to exist for all mankind." (Havas News Agency, 24th)

Paris - Today is Christmas Day. General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, issued a message to the soldiers, stating, "As this festive season arrives again and the new year is approaching, I extend my sincere congratulations to my comrades in the army. The cause we uphold is extremely great, and the soldiers on the front lines have fought bravely and achieved victories, so victory is within our grasp. No matter what strategies the enemy employs in psychological warfare or substantive warfare, we will be able to resist and achieve victory. This is no different from the beginning of the last European war." It is noted that General Gamelin is known for his silence, so the issuance of the message to the soldiers as above has great significance. This public figure has commanded the Allied forces for nearly four months, and has issued only two orders. The first order was issued on October 14, stating, "A major war could break out at any time. The fate of our country depends on the future of the war. This is what the whole country and the people of the world are watching. You must strive to be diligent and do your best. The two victories on the Marne River (September 1914) and Verdun (March 1916) should be remembered and not forgotten." The second order was issued on November 25, discussing the mobile warfare conducted by Germany on October 16, stating, "Since then, the German army has continued to prepare for an attack but has not dared to launch an offensive on the entire front. You must wait with resolute will for the arrival of events." (Havas News Agency, 25th)

### The British King Greets His Country‚Äôs Military and Civilians on Christmas; The Allied Nations' War Aims Are to Protect Christian Civilization

London - King George VI delivered a broadcast speech to his subjects this afternoon, stating first that Christmas is a peaceful family holiday, and that all free nations love peace because only peace can ensure the safety of families. To this day, the entire policy pursued by a certain powerful nation is based on engaging in aggression and destroying the things that humanity cherishes most. This is truly a great tragedy of our time. All the subjects of our country are united and fighting hard because they are stimulated by this. I know deeply in your hearts that you all have a firm belief that you will be able to achieve the final victory. I would like to take this Christmas holiday to first extend my congratulations to the officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, especially the soldiers of the expeditionary force. At the same time, I would like to extend my congratulations to the subjects of the country. In short, I firmly believe that the war aims of our country's loyal allied nations are to protect Christian civilization. As the new year is approaching, I would like to encourage everyone together.

### The Irish Republican Army Raids an Armory, Seizing a Large Quantity of Weapons and Ammunition

London - According to a message from Dublin, some members of the Irish Republican Army sneaked into the armory of the South Irish Army Barracks in Phoenix Park last night, stealing a large quantity of military equipment and ammunition. They loaded it onto trucks outside the barracks and sped away. They gained entry by trickery. Once inside the armory, they threatened the guards, preventing them from raising an alarm. At the time, a park attendant saw that the power lines had been cut and knew something was happening. He tried to notify the police, but he was stopped and suffered a head injury. He is currently in the hospital, and his life is in danger. (Reuters News Agency, 25th)

London - It has just been learned that the armory in Phoenix Park in Dublin, the capital of the Irish Free State, was raided by armed thugs yesterday afternoon. Although army soldiers arrived to stop them, a large quantity of weapons and ammunition was still seized. The Intelligence Department has just issued a message about this incident, stating that at 6:30 yesterday afternoon, many armed thugs in Dublin arrived at Phoenix Park in four trucks. One of them, dressed in a military uniform, went to the front of the armory and knocked on the door, saying that he had a package to deliver to the officer in charge. The guard immediately opened the door, and the thugs rushed in, taking control of the guards inside the armory and beginning to loot it. They also opened fire on the nearby military barracks. The soldiers in the barracks immediately rushed to the armory and captured four of the thugs, but a considerable amount of military equipment and ammunition had already been seized.

### American Perceptions of the European War

(New York Airmail) Former British Naval Secretary Duff Cooper, upon arriving in New York, published an article entitled "The European War and America," stating that anyone traveling to the United States at this time will have the initial impression that they are not traveling from one continent to another, but from one planet to another pleasant new planet. This planet is certainly not Mars (Mars is associated with the god of war). Its inhabitants are using giant telescopes to observe the more unfortunate Earth with great accuracy because the American side has swift and accurate records of everything happening in the Old World. Its comments are also extremely insightful and unbiased.

What we see and hear upon setting foot on this land is ever-increasing prosperity and a thriving culture. Most people are able to enjoy happiness, so they all have a belief that the United States should not be drawn into the vortex of war, no matter the cost. Europeans have no right to criticize this. Moreover, although the American people have this belief, they are not indifferent to the tragedies that are happening in the world or dismiss them without discussion. On the contrary, they are not only extremely concerned about the events happening in Europe, but they also deeply understand that this is related to American interests. Germany often declares to the people of Britain and the United States that the Treaty of Versailles is the source of all evil and that all the unfortunate events that have occurred in Europe are due to this treaty. Many people believe this idea. It not only represents an opinion, but it has almost become a recognized fact. However, in reality, the Treaty of Versailles, which was established in 1919, cannot be considered perfect now, but on the other hand, it was possible to sign an even worse treaty at that time. This is because representatives from various countries gathered in Paris to discuss how to revise the map of the world, and the work they undertook was not easy. Moreover, the countries they represented, witnessing the results of the great war, with countless lives lost, had a deep impression of the desolation of the situation at that time. In addition, after overcoming the pain, each country believed that Germany should bear the responsibility for the war, so they were extremely angry with Germany and wanted to retaliate. Under these circumstances, the representatives of each country still did their best to formulate this treaty in accordance with the principle of national self-determination, which is already commendable. Even in terms of its most severe clauses, it is much fairer than the most lenient clauses in the treaties that Germany signed with Russia and Romania. Not only that, although the Treaty of Versailles is regarded as the root of all evils, there are still some facts that we cannot forget in the past twenty years. After this treaty was signed, it was replaced by the Locarno Pact in less than six years. This pact was established with the full agreement of the countries concerned. "At the time of signing, the representatives of a free Germany also expressed that this pact was fair and glorious. From then on, the relationship between Britain, France, and Germany was no longer based on the Treaty of Versailles, but on the Locarno Pact. Therefore, if we consider the Treaty of Versailles to be a crime, we will inevitably go too far.

As for the issue that the American people are currently paying attention to, it is how the various issues should be resolved after the current war ends. Therefore, anyone traveling to the United States from Europe is asked about the war aims of the democratic countries. Europeans find this question surprising because people who are fighting to preserve their lives often do not have time to consider their war aims or what to do after winning. Therefore, Europeans have not paid much attention to this issue since the outbreak of the European war. On the contrary, observers on the other side of the Atlantic cannot help but consider this to be the most important issue. Therefore, we should answer it in a timely manner. However, how the map of Europe should be redrawn after the end of the war is our war aim. It is to build a new Europe, so that all countries can abide by faith in the future, and violence and aggression will disappear. In other words, all countries living in this new Europe, regardless of whether they are defeated or victorious, can coexist peacefully and share prosperity.

Secondly, the American people may have doubts about the fact that the war on the front lines is at a stalemate and that Britain, France, and Germany have not launched major offensives. Their state of mind is like us going to the theater to watch a tragedy. Before the curtain rises, we imagine that the plot must be very tragic, so we are nervous and sit in suspense. However, the stage does not reveal anything for a long time, so the audience asks, "When will the curtain rise?" This is doubt, not disappointment. Moreover, this kind of emotion is very natural, and the doubts it raises can be resolved. In short, this is a temporary phenomenon. We dare to assert that this question will soon be answered. At that time, it may even be considered too realistic and too cruel. (Havas News Agency)

### Fierce Fighting Between Soviet and Finnish Forces in the Karelian Isthmus; Heavy Snow in the North, Only Aircraft Activity

Moscow - According to a communiqu√© issued by the Leningrad Military District, "There were no major developments on the front lines on the 24th, only fierce clashes in the Karelian Isthmus. As a result, the Finnish army left behind 971 bodies, and another 35 Finnish soldiers were captured, including four officers." (Tass News Agency, 25th)

Helsinki - The General Headquarters issued a war report stating: (1) In the Karelian Isthmus, our patrol teams repeatedly invaded Soviet positions and engaged in activities. Afterwards, they returned to the defense lines. The Red Army launched two attacks between the towns of Kikokieve and Pannasjieville, but they were repelled. (2) In the area of the town of Aglaviejie, our army advanced victoriously, and the advance troops reached the town of Atojiekie between the cities of Somosalmi and Riajte. (3) Our army captured two tanks, many trucks, two flat-trajectory guns, and 100 horses. (4) Yesterday, the weather was clear, and Soviet aircraft flew to Apokotjia and Aikennanskoviezdou harbor to bomb and strafe civilians with machine guns. Our aircraft also took off and fought with enemy aircraft in various places, shooting down a total of 14 enemy aircraft. It could not be confirmed whether two more aircraft were shot down. We had no losses. (Havas News Agency, 24th)

Moscow - The war report issued yesterday by the Leningrad Soviet Army Headquarters stated that no major incidents had occurred on the front lines. There were several air battles, and 16 enemy aircraft were shot down. (Haitong News Agency, 25th)

Petsamo - A reporter from the Haitong News Agency sent a dispatch from Petsamo, a place on the Finnish front lines, stating that the climate here is extremely cold, 27 degrees below zero Celsius. The blizzard blowing from the northwest has lasted for six days, and it is getting worse tonight. Patrolmen are constantly sweeping snow. Snow is piled up into walls on both sides of the camp gate, as if one is in a snow palace. There was no fighting here today, but if the weather changes, the Soviet army withdrawing from the south will be a little far away from here tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Currently, all routes are closed due to snow accumulation, and tanks cannot move, but aircraft on both sides are making more use of the snow because the aircraft are equipped with strong ski skids. Today, looking south, we repeatedly saw aircraft coming and going, which should be Soviet aircraft supplying food to the troops withdrawing northeast of Salmij√§rvi. We received a broadcast report from Helsinki stating that the Soviet army has withdrawn in several places due to the climate. The Finnish army here hopes for reinforcements so that it can achieve the goal of surrounding the Soviet army in the Arctic region. If Finnish reinforcements do not arrive, the Finnish army will be at a disadvantage due to the disparity in numbers. Currently, the morale of the Finnish army is still very calm. (Haitong News Agency, 25th)

### Belgian Socialist Party Supports Neutrality

Brussels - The Belgian Socialist Party held a Christmas congress this morning to discuss foreign policy. A motion was immediately passed to support a policy of neutrality, stating that once various changes occur in the international situation that are sufficient to threaten our country's freedom, territorial integrity, and vital interests, we will be forced to reconsider our policy of neutrality. However, neutrality does not mean prohibiting public opinion from expressing its views on the causes of the war and the things being fought for in euphemistic terms. In addition, the current government has made it clear that the independence and neutrality of the Netherlands is of utmost importance to Belgium. Our party is very satisfied with this statement. In short, the autocratic countries should be held responsible for initiating a policy of violence that led to the war. Our party hereby exposes them and sincerely hopes that all nations that have been invaded can regain their independence. It also expresses solidarity with the Second International (i.e., the Socialist International), advocating the establishment of lasting peace based on respect for the rights essential to the survival of all nations."

### Budgetary Battle in the Japanese Diet by John Ahlers, Translated from the Millard's Review of the Far East

The budget session of the Japanese Diet and House of Peers for 1939-40 began on the 23rd in Tokyo. The demons of Japanese parliamentary politics have once again been temporarily unleashed. In reality, the Diet will begin in earnest next month, as it is customary to adjourn for the New Year holidays before the Diet formally opens. At that time, the demons of constitutional Japan will be allowed to appear and disappear on the political stage for three to four months until the funds requested by the government are approved by those who are supposedly representing the Japanese people. The performance, full of ghostly shadows, will come to an end with the final vote on Japan's 1940-41 budget, and Japanese parliamentary politics will once again sleep soundly for three seasons. The rulers of Japan often employ their strategies and are very successful. Therefore, they have no doubt that when the members of the Diet and House of Peers are allowed to see the light, they will not stubbornly resist, and will obediently and happily return to the darkness.

Of the two houses of the Japanese Diet, what was once a real budgetary battle has become merely a mock battle in recent years. Especially since the outbreak of the current Sino-Japanese War, there has been no real budgetary debate in Tokyo. The Konoe and Hiranuma cabinets have both presented budgets and made unprecedented monetary demands on the Japanese people, but these budgets have not been satisfactorily explained or justified, nor have they been criticized. The main item in the budget is the military's demand for armaments and war expenses, the amount of which far exceeds Japan's true total income. This year, military and war expenses account for almost one-third of Japan's total expenditures. So-called patriotic arguments are used as excuses for members of the Diet and House of Peers not to oppose these demands, and allow the heads of the army and navy to arrogantly, even rudely, issue extremely vague explanations, characterized by an unparalleled lack of certainty. The Diet and House of Peers only seriously discuss the minor items in the budget, and even then, they only pick out the insignificant ones for closer consideration and slight criticism.

Judging from the appearances, the situation in the 1939-40 budget session will not undergo fundamental changes. Japan's difficult economic situation and the prolonged war in China have resulted in some unrest among the Japanese people and increased misunderstandings among their ruling groups. The Abe government is particularly weak, lacking both resources and creativity. Diet politicians will likely stir up more intense noise than usual for the benefit of their supporters, and stage political dramas. The two major political parties, the Minseito and the Seiyukai, will use this opportunity to remind the people that these two parties have not completely disappeared and, while not actually maintaining the demand to participate in the Japanese government, they still maintain this demand in principle. However, it should not be mistaken that the Diet and House of Peers will raise any of the following fundamental budgetary issues: (1) the process of supplying funds for the war in China and huge armament replenishment; (2) the Japanese army and navy arbitrarily disposing of one-quarter of Japan's national income; (3) the huge deficit; (4) the unconstrained borrowing policy; (5) the increasing approach of Japanese national bankruptcy.

But these fundamental issues will lead to a fierce battle behind the scenes of Japanese parliamentary politics, not only between members of the Diet and the government, but also among the truly important figures in the government. The fierce battle began a few weeks ago when Finance Minister and Director-General of the Cabinet Planning Board Aoki drafted the budget and abandoned long-standing precedents. In previous years, only the regular budget was drafted before the budget meeting. The army and navy were accustomed to submitting special expense figures only after the Diet had been in session for some time. The army and navy had to tolerate any reductions in regular military spending, and they had the opportunity to recover the reduced amount in the special budget. But this year, Aoki firmly requested the army and navy to submit all their monetary demands in advance. After obtaining the budgets of the army and navy, Aoki bravely cut a huge sum of 2,000,000,000 yen from these budgets, and before the army and navy ministers could recover from their astonishment, he persuaded the cabinet to approve this cut and announce its regular and special budgets. The military opposed this, and the army and navy ministers had to strongly demand the return of the lost 2,000,000,000 yen. The behind-the-scenes struggle for this funding in the Japanese budget session, and the anger during the infighting, could lead to the collapse of the Abe cabinet and a rupture in the harmony of Japanese control over the war in China, which is not impossible.

Aoki is neither a "Great Liberal" nor a representative of Japanese private capitalism, but a semi-militarist expansionist and an enthusiast for "Greater Japan," fundamentally agreeing with the Japanese military, which makes his position more comfortable and stronger than his excellent predecessor Ikeda. However, Aoki has not forgotten his arithmetic and is closely familiar with Japan's serious economic and financial situation, and has come to the conclusion that Japan is unable to approve the huge demands additionally proposed by the army and navy, otherwise it will fall into financial disaster. Aoki understands that Japan has done its utmost in this regard and cannot do more than this, after going through great difficulties to meet the monetary demands of the army and navy personnel. The Tokyo military is about to implement a huge program, on the one hand continuing to fight in China on the previous scale, and on the other hand mechanizing all the newly formed army divisions. Aoki tried to make the army understand that for financial reasons, these two "New Year's gifts" cannot be obtained at the same time, and the army must decide which one to take. In fact, Aoki is prepared to give the Japanese military 330,000,000 yen more in the 1940-41 period than in the current fiscal year of 1939-40. The budget he drafted allocates the following funds to the Japanese army and navy:

Regular Budget

Army... 1,297,000,000 yen

Navy... 1,018,000,000 yen

Special Budget

Army... 2,973,000,000 yen

Navy... 737,000,000 yen

Reserve... 750,000,000 yen

Total... 6,757,000,000 yen

The total regular and special budget for Japan in 1940-41 reaches 10,360,000,000 yen, of which more than 600,000,000 yen will be handed over by the Tokyo government to the local authorities in Japan, so the true government budget is about 9,700,000,000 yen, of which military spending accounts for about six-tenths. Several other budget items, including indirect military spending, such as the public welfare budget, are almost entirely used to care for soldiers wounded in the war in China and the families of soldiers killed in the war in China. The budget for the Ministry of Finance has increased by 400,000,000 yen, mostly because the interest on the government bonds issued to compensate for military spending in China has increased. In total, the expenses of the army and navy, and the expenses required for the army and navy's adventures in China, account for more than seven-tenths of the total budget for 1940-41. If Aoki had approved the additional 2,000,000,000 yen demanded by the army and navy, then the total Japanese budget would have increased to 11,700,000,000 yen, of which almost 75 percent would have been allocated to the army and navy, which is completely beyond Japan's financial capacity.

Now, comparing Japan's revenue budget for 1940-41 with the above-mentioned expenditure figures, the ordinary revenue from existing sources is estimated to be only 3,418,000,000 yen. Japan will order a general tax increase, euphemistically called tax reform, and it is expected that the tax increase will generate another 731,000,000 yen in revenue. In that case, the estimated total revenue is 4,149,000,000 yen, which is about 1,000,000,000 yen higher than this year, with taxes continuing to increase by about 35 percent, but still short of the drafted total expenditure of 5,500,000,000 yen. The new domestic debt that the Tokyo government plans to issue in the next fiscal year starting on April 1, 1940, is also around 5,500,000,000 yen. The government bonds issued in this fiscal year are planned to be 5,900,000,000 yen. From this situation, it seems that Japan is beginning to slightly reduce the issuance of government bonds, but this impression is false, because the Tokyo government is delaying the huge amount of government bond issuance rights that have not yet been used, and plans to use these issuance rights in 1940-41, when the government bonds actually issued will be far larger than in any previous year.

Since the outbreak of this war in China, Japan has issued 10,662,000,000 yen worth of domestic debt. Therefore, the national debt, which was 10,580,301,000 yen at the end of June 1937, had increased to 20,859,382,000 yen by the end of last month. Adding the government bonds to be issued in the remaining days of this fiscal year and the 5,500,000,000 yen planned to be issued in 1940-41, will increase the national debt to more than 28,000,000,000 yen. The interest and zero amortization of this stupid debt alone will require more than 2,000,000,000 yen, which actually accounts for half of Japan's estimated total regular revenue in the next fiscal year. From these figures, it is not surprising that the Japanese Finance Minister feels that he cannot add more funds in his new budget. These budgets account for no less than one-third of Japan's current national income. In the past few months, Japan's ability to absorb government bonds has decreased, while inflation has continued to increase. The Bank of Japan's issuance of banknotes is repeatedly setting new records.

Japan's finances have begun to become an irreversible situation. Even if Aoki is tough enough to make the military's additional demand for 2,000,000,000 yen fail, the final disaster and collapse has already shown signs.

### All Sectors Enthusiastically Celebrated National Renaissance Day Yesterday, Believing That Under the Leadership of the Leader, Striving Hard Will Surely Complete the Mission of National Renaissance

Yesterday was National Renaissance Day and the 24th Anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. In accordance with the Central Government's regulations, the Zhaowei Memorial was also held jointly. All sectors of the city unanimously and enthusiastically celebrated. All agencies, public organizations, and schools also had a holiday as usual. All sectors recalled that in the early years of the Republic, Yuan Shikai attempted to restore the monarchy, and the foundation of the revolution was on the verge of collapse. Fortunately, the martyrs Cai E and others organized the National Protection Army and launched an uprising in Yunnan. Various provinces responded, shattering Yuan's dream of restoring the monarchy, and the foundation of the Republic was re-established. They also recalled the Xi'an Incident three years ago, when the Leader, with his great revolutionary personality and determination to believe in the Three Principles of the People, and with the universal support of the people of the whole country, finally turned danger into safety and returned to the capital. Since then, the whole country has formed an unprecedented unity and launched the sacred War of Resistance, working hard until today. At this time, the military situation of the War of Resistance is becoming increasingly favorable. It is firmly believed that under the leadership of the Leader, through hard work, the great mission of resisting the war, building the country, and reviving the nation will surely be completed. As for the 28th National Renaissance Day commemorative bookmarks that replaced New Year's cards, they are divided into five types: Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, Wisdom, and Faith. They have a portrait of the President and the four characters "Happy New Year," and also record the President's instructions.

All Sectors Promote Thrift and Disaster Relief

All sectors, in accordance with the General Order on Economic Thrift, unanimously promoted thrift and stored up national resources.

Some even brought items to the refugee hospitals to visit sick refugees. The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association on Chihama Road sold Christmas Anti-Tuberculosis seals this year to raise funds for the anti-tuberculosis cause. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of all parties, the results were very satisfactory.

### Wu Mulan's Life Story

Wu Mulan's life story, compiled from interviews, is as follows. Ms. Wu, named Mulan, courtesy name Youzhi, is 50 years old and from Fuzhou, Jiangxi. She lives in Room 5, Hongren Lane, Lafayette Road, Shanghai, having moved from Nanjing Sitiao Lane. At the age of 18 (i.e., at the end of the Guangxu period), she studied in Japan, met Sun Yat-sen, and participated in the revolution, traveling at home and abroad and being responsible for contacting overseas student organizations. During the Xinhai Revolution, she served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Women's Northern Expeditionary Army. During Yuan Shikai's reign, she served as an advisor to the Presidential Palace. Later, due to her opposition to the Twenty-One Demands and Yuan's attempt to become emperor, she was arrested and imprisoned for assassinating Yuan. She was released after Yuan's death. When Ge Jing'en was the president of the Cultural College, he hired her as a director. In 1929, when Ju Zheng was arrested in Shanghai, she rescued and released him. When Wang Zhengting was the Minister of Judicial Administration, he appointed her as a member of the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the president of the Nanjing Women's Law and Politics Training Institute and the president of the Nanjing Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society. After the August 13 Incident, she organized rescue teams in the Su, Zhe, Wan, and Gan areas and handled women's work in the rear. When the National Army retreated from Nanjing, she was one of the last to withdraw. She went through Jiangxi, Hankou, Guangdong, and Hong Kong, and arrived in Shanghai in September of last year, residing on Route du P√®re Huc. This spring, she moved to Wanyi Lane on Rue Luber, and in the summer, she moved to Room 5, Hongren Lane, Lafayette Road.

This summer, when Zuo Yanhan and others from the people of Jiangsu and Anhui heard that she was in Shanghai, they invited Jingbo, the retired abbot of Qingliang Temple in Shanghai and former president of the Chinese Buddhist Association, and earnestly requested her to serve the country and save the people. In September, she was appointed by the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government as the Commander-in-Chief of the Central Su-Wan Border Defense Reserve Team. Just as she was preparing to leave Shanghai to formally take office, she became ill and resided at the Continental Hotel, and on the 6th of this month, she moved to Room 10 of the Huabei Apartment to avoid attention. At approximately 9:15 a.m. on the 20th of this month, she was suddenly killed in the Huabei Apartment. The French Concession Police Department transported her body to the mortuary on Route Jules Tillot for an autopsy. At 11:00 a.m. on the 23rd, Wang, a prosecutor appointed by the Second District Court of the Shanghai Special District, conducted an examination and determined that she had been shot once in the head and once in the chest, and had bled to death. Her body was claimed by her son, Wu Zhenqiu, and her adopted son, Zhou Peibao, at 3:00 p.m. and placed in the White Palace Funeral Home on Great Western Road. The funeral was held at 2:00 p.m. on the 24th. Guests included Wen Lanting, Wang Peiyuan, and Mrs. Zhang Fengjiu. She was previously married to Commander Wang Jiannong, but later divorced due to circumstances. Wang became a monk and died of illness. She had a son named Zhenqiu, who used her surname, and is now 18 years old and a second-year student at Qianbo Middle School. This summer, he married Li Manjun as his wife, who is 18 years old and from Beiping, and is studying at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts on Caishi Road. She had a adopted daughter named Yinjiao, who is 16 years old, and an adopted son, Zhou Peibao, who is in his twenties and a lawyer, living at No. 18, Lane 29, Seymour Road. She was generous, chivalrous, and kind. She was close friends with Ju Jusheng, Wang Daichun, Wen Lanting, Ge Jingen, Wang Kecheng, Ji Zhongshu, Wang Zhuoshan, Dai Jitao, Yu Youren, Jiao Yitang, and Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Fengjiu. She believed in Buddhism and took refuge in Master Taixu.

### Christmas Day Double Murder in Shanghai: Four Dead, Two Injured; Outside the Zhaofeng Casino

The Zhaofeng Casino on Yu Yuan Road in Western Shanghai, to attract gamblers and avoid external criticism, usually operates under the guise of the Huierdeng Ballroom. It was once embroiled in a dispute over gambling between Japanese nationals, leading to the revocation of its license by the Japanese authorities. However, through repeated maneuvering, the casino was allowed to resume operations. Unexpectedly, another shooting occurred at the casino yesterday morning, resulting in two deaths and one injury. It is reported that around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, a group of men inside the casino, their gambling spirits waning, entered the Huierdeng Ballroom, each escorting a partner for dancing. Around 3:30 AM, the dancers, after some pleasant conversation, slowly strolled out of the casino. As they reached the road from the driveway, someone lying in ambush opened fire, shooting several times. The leading dancer immediately fell to the ground, while the second was shot in the head and collapsed in a pool of blood. At the time, a Wuxi native named Liu Heng (38 years old) was also hit in the head and chest, and collapsed, barely alive. Stray bullets flew in all directions, and the casino's gamblers, unaware of the situation, fled in terror. The doormen also took off. The shooter jumped into a car with license plate number 12141 parked by the roadside and sped away. Upon receiving the news, the Public Concession Police dispatched a large force to investigate, and an ambulance took one of the injured dancers to Tongren Hospital, where he soon died due to his injuries. At the same time, Japanese military police also arrived. Another dancer was taken away by the Japanese in a car. Liu Heng, barely alive, was also taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but died shortly after arrival. It has been learned that the dancer who died at Tongren Hospital was named Chen Mingchu. The person taken away by the Japanese was He Xingjian, a former special commissioner of the Pudong Loyal Patriotic Army, who has since left that position and is now working elsewhere. He was reportedly taken by the Japanese to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road in Hongkou, suffering from a severe head injury. Chen was He's subordinate. Liu was a silk merchant living at No. 5 Jinshou Lane on Shandong Road. It is still unknown whether this shooting is related to politics or a personal feud.

### Detailed Account of the Incident in Western Newspaper

The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that at 3:50 AM this morning (December 25th), three Chinese men were shot by unidentified assassins in the dark alley outside the back door of the Huierdeng Ballroom on Yu Yuan Road, resulting in two deaths and one injury. The deceased were identified as Chen Mingchu and Liu Heng, a silk worker residing at No. 5 Jingxiu Lane (transliteration) on Shandong Road. The injured man was reportedly He Xingjian, the former commissioner of the Loyal Patriotic Army stationed in Shanghai, who suffered a severe head injury and was taken by a Japanese car to a hospital in Hongkou. As of this afternoon, his latest condition is unknown. Chen suffered chest wounds and was taken to Tongren Hospital near the scene of the shooting. Despite doctors' efforts, he succumbed to his injuries. Liu was taken to the Gu Ge Road Red Cross Hospital, where injuries were found on his face and chest, and he died within minutes of arrival. The bodies of the two deceased were not allowed to remain in the hospital. This morning, two groups of Japanese nationals went to Tongren Hospital and the Red Cross Hospital to claim the bodies, which were taken away by car to an unknown location. According to those near the scene, the shooting occurred suddenly, and it is impossible to determine whether the assassins were one or several. However, it is said that a total of six shots were fired. One account states that Chen Mingchu drove his car (license plate number 3190) to the Huierdeng Ballroom around 3:00 AM this morning. After sitting for a while, he met with He Xingjian, exchanged a few words, and then exited the back door of the ballroom, presumably heading to the gambling hall, as a small path connects the gambling hall and the ballroom. Less than a minute after the two left the door, they were suddenly shot from behind and fell to the ground. Liu Heng, apparently standing very close to the two, was also hit by the gunfire. Customers in the gambling hall and ballroom scattered in panic upon hearing the gunshots, causing great chaos. The Public Concession Police Department will not investigate this case because it occurred outside the concession area.

### Cunxintedantang Pharmacy

Inside the Cunxintedantang Pharmacy at 599 Connaught Road, Gordon Road intersection in the Western District of the Public Concession, several people suddenly opened fire on a well-dressed young man in a Western suit around 8:00 PM last night, killing two and injuring one. The details are as follows:

Gunshots Sounded: The Cunxintedantang Pharmacy had just opened yesterday, and many guests from all walks of life came to offer congratulations. The pharmacy hosted a banquet in the store last night at 8:00 PM to entertain the guests. As the festivities were in full swing, several unfamiliar men suddenly broke in. As the guests were still in shock, gunshots rang out, causing everyone to panic and scramble for escape.

Youth Killed: One of the men killed was a young man named Gu Guoqing, wearing a striped flannel Western suit and a black overcoat, with chicken leather shoes. He was shot twice in the head, once in the hand, and once in the chest, and died before he could be treated.

Guest Dies: In addition, the owner of the pharmacy, Li Linfu, was thanking the guests when he was also shot twice, once in the chest and once in the waist. Due to the vital nature of the injuries, he died shortly after. It was later learned that Li resided at No. 3 Sanyi Lane on Xin Zha Road and was a native of Changzhou, 49 years old. He was also a shareholder in the Jisheng Stock at No. 10, Lane 195, Fujian Road.

Apprentice Injured: At the time, the pharmacy's apprentice, Han Shixin, 16 years old, had been unemployed for a long time and had only recently found work. He was serving the guests at the scene yesterday when he was unexpectedly hit by a stray bullet in the right thigh. He was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. After the incident, the shooters scattered. The police, upon receiving the report, dispatched detectives to investigate and collected the bullets for further examination.

### No Plans to Increase Domestic Postal Rates; Shanghai Post Office Unaware of Rate Hike; Postal Rates Increased Once in 1932

Rumors of an increase in domestic postal rates are untrue. The Shanghai postal authorities are also unaware of any such increase. It is known that the Directorate General of Posts increased domestic postal rates in 1932. The details are as follows:

Domestic Postal Rates

According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Shanghai Postal Administration, prior to 1932, the domestic rate for ordinary letters was only 4 cents, the local rate for ordinary letters was only 1 cent, the domestic rate for postcards (single) was only 2 cents, and double postcards were also only 4 cents. On May 1, 1932, the Directorate General of Posts submitted a new postal rate, which was approved by the Ministry of Communications, increasing the domestic rate for ordinary letters to 5 cents, the local rate for ordinary letters to 2 cents, the rate for postcards (single) to 2.5 cents, and double postcards to 5 cents.

No Increase

At that time, nationals from both local and other areas believed that the increase was too large and telegraphed the Ministry of Communications and the Directorate General of Posts to reconsider. Therefore, the implementation was delayed until May 20 of that year, demonstrating the careful consideration given to this matter by the Ministry of Communications and the postal authorities. However, rumors of another increase in domestic postal rates have recently surfaced. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Shanghai postal authorities, this claim is absolutely untrue. To date, the bureau is unaware of any such rumors.

### Zhuang Songfu's 80th Birthday Celebrated in Keli Today

Today (26th) is the 80th birthday of Zhuang Songfu, former director of the Huai River Commission of the National Government, and a celebration will be held in Keli, Fenghua. Throughout his life, Zhuang has devoted himself to various undertakings such as guiding the Huai River, promoting education, and developing agriculture, making significant contributions to society and earning the respect of both the government and the public. It is reported that Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, and others have all presented plaques and congratulatory messages. Many people in Shanghai have also presented poems, lyrics, and plaques, which have been forwarded by the China Agricultural Bookstore. Many people are also taking ships from Shanghai to Ningbo and then to Fenghua to offer their congratulations. It is also reported that the Qiowo Cottage, built by Zhuang in his hometown of Fenghua, will hold a completion ceremony today, and his "Miscellaneous Writings of Qiuwo Mountain Man" will also be published simultaneously.

### Death of Shang Ai, Executive Secretary of the YMCA

The National YMCA of this city received a telegram from Kunming yesterday, reporting the death of Shang Ai (an American), director of the municipal association's group department, in Kunming. Shang had served in China for nearly 20 years and was always enthusiastic. Although his health had been declining recently, he was particularly dedicated to his work out of sympathy for China. Two months ago, he worked in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guizhou. After attending the general secretary conference of the YMCA in Chongqing, he planned to go to Yangon via the Yunnan-Burma Road and then to various ports in Southeast Asia to raise funds for the association's wartime service work. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Kunming, he died suddenly of heart disease on the morning of the 24th. The association was deeply saddened by this tragic news.

The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that news had been received in this city that M. Manson, who has been tirelessly engaged in YMCA activities in China for many years, recently attended a meeting of YMCA leaders in Chongqing and died suddenly of heart disease on his way back to Shanghai. He passed away in Kunming yesterday (24th) morning. Mr. Manson was born in the state of Iowa in the United States in 1877 and graduated from Grinnell College in 1909. He came to China in 1910 to serve as the secretary of the YMCA's International Committee in China, serving for many years in Shanghai and Fuzhou.

### Customs Releases National Foreign Trade Figures for January to November; Improved from July Onwards, Reducing Import Surplus; Export Surplus Achieved in November

The Customs has released the national foreign trade figures for January to November this year. Imports of foreign goods were valued at 1,245,416,359 national currency units, and exports of domestic goods were valued at 905,118,659 national currency units. The total value of imports and exports was 2,150,535,018 national currency units, resulting in an import surplus of 340,297,700 national currency units. However, since the implementation of the ban on imported goods on July 1st, and the collection of exchange rate differences for exported goods, the import of luxury and semi-luxury goods has been respectively prohibited and restricted, while the export of major domestic goods has surged. As a result, trade improved, the import surplus decreased sharply, and by November, an export surplus was achieved. The detailed figures are as follows:

Import of Foreign Goods

Grains and grain powders accounted for the largest share, totaling 210,598,378 national currency units. Next were cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton thread, totaling 165,300,891 national currency units. This was followed by candles, soaps, oils, waxes, glues, and pine resin, totaling 101,910,014 national currency units. Metals and mineral sands totaled 67,883,824 national currency units.

### Human Trafficking Sentence

The local residents Yu Zhangshi, Zhou Xikun, and Chen Sunshi, convicted of human trafficking, lured Tang Dexin's daughter, Tang Meili, into a hidden location within the Qihua Hotel on Beijing Road 305 Lane on the 20th of this month, with the intention of selling her for profit. The scheme was thwarted by the Old Gate Police and they were arrested. Yesterday, they were brought before Judge Fu of the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court for interrogation. Yu Zhangshi was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for violating family rights. Zhou Xikun and Chen Sunshi were each sentenced to nine months of imprisonment. Tang Meili was returned to her father.

### Restaurant Patrons Robbed of Large Sum of Money; Police Mistook Robbery for Fire; Bandits Escaped After Looting

At 8:00 PM the night before last, a robbery occurred at the Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant at 32 White Linen Road in Western Shanghai. Six people, including Cao Xiaogou and Zhangshi, managers of the Fugong gambling den there, went upstairs to order food. As they were about to begin their meal, four unexpected guests arrived at their table, each producing a handgun. First, they searched Cao Xiaogou's wife, ordering her not to make a sound, and then proceeded to rob them. As a result, Zhangshi was robbed of 1,700 yuan, Zhangshi's eldest daughter was robbed of two gold rings and one diamond ring, and Zhangshi's girlfriend was robbed of over 300 yuan. After obtaining the loot, the bandits hid it in their pockets and calmly went downstairs. Nearby shops blew their whistles, mistaking the robbery for a fire. They immediately reported it to the Caojiadu Fire Department, which dispatched two fire trucks. After learning of the situation, the police quickly dispatched two armored cars to the scene, but the bandits had already escaped into the narrow alley in front of the Gonghe Sauce Garden on White Linen Road.

### Nanhua Store Manager Accused of Assault

Song Weiyue, a 30-year-old Chongming native residing at No. 15 Xujiahui Road, hired miscellaneous solicitor Zhu Yakui as his agent to sue fellow villagers Shi Danggui (manager of Xiexingtai Nanhua Store at No. 366 and 8 Malay Road) and Shi Haichun (clerk at Taian Zhan in Minquan Road) in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The plaintiff stated that on October 19th at 6:00 PM, the defendants came to the plaintiff's house and, after the plaintiff went downstairs to talk, without any cause, summoned several people who had come with them and violently beat the plaintiff, causing serious injuries. The plaintiff reported the incident to the police, who verified the injuries, and requested that the defendants be investigated and prosecuted for the crime of assault under Article 277, Section 1 of the law. Regarding the civil claim, the plaintiff requested that it be reserved. The court, upon receiving the complaint, opened a trial yesterday afternoon, presided over by Judge Sun Pengxian. The plaintiff, accompanied by a lawyer, appeared in court despite being ill and described the assault. The defendants, also accompanied by defense counsel, appeared in court. Shi Danggui denied participating in the assault and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. Shi Haichun stated that on that day, he went to the plaintiff to collect a debt based on an IOU. During the argument, the plaintiff ordered his associates to assault him. He saw that the situation was not good and left. The plaintiff has already reported the incident to the police and filed a public prosecution, which has been accepted and is currently on bail. He requested that the court declare the case inadmissible. After examining the witnesses, the court ordered closing arguments, declared the hearing concluded, and scheduled a date for the verdict.

### Refugee Arts Exhibition Continues Today

Yesterday (December 25th) was the third day of the Arts Exhibition held by the Shanghai Refugee Cooperative Society's Production Fund Raising Committee on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Fellow Association. It coincided with the Christmas holiday, and a large number of Chinese and foreign visitors attended, which was rare in recent times. The association had originally planned to close yesterday, but because many of the masterpieces sent by calligraphers, painters, and collectors for the exhibition had not yet been displayed, it was decided to continue the exhibition for one more day. All of the historical and contemporary paintings and calligraphy that were in storage have been displayed. Some are entirely donated to the association, while others are offered at reduced prices with a portion of the proceeds donated. Those who love painting and calligraphy can go to visit. It is said that the admission tickets are still 40 cents each, and calligraphy and painting tickets are 10 yuan each, which can be used as admission tickets and can also be used to draw lots after the exhibition closes. The lottery prizes include paintings and calligraphy worth at least 10 yuan or even up to 100 yuan. Anyone who purchases paintings and calligraphy at the event will receive a pair of socks (produced by the society's sock factory) as a souvenir.

### Rickshaws on the Isolated Island

‚Äî He

There are ten thousand rickshaws in the two concessions; more than 50,000 people rely on them for a living.

In Shanghai, the public transportation includes automobiles, trams, and rickshaws. The latter‚Äîthe rickshaw, although a backward means of transportation, is still an important means of transportation for the general public in Shanghai.

After the war, Shanghai was considered a haven for refugees, and the population increased dramatically. The number of rickshaws in the Public Concession did not decrease but remained at nearly 10,000. The French Concession currently has only three or four thousand rickshaws. Before the war, there were about 10,000 rickshaws, including those in the Chinese area. This type of rickshaw is commonly known as "small license" and can only operate within the French Concession. As for the rickshaws in the Public Concession, commonly known as "large license," they can operate in both concessions. Currently, the total number of rickshaws in the two concessions is about 13,400. Each rickshaw is pulled by four people in shifts, so there are 55,600 rickshaw pullers. Compared with the number of people in various industries, rickshaw pullers account for a large number.

The life of a rickshaw puller is said to be the most arduous of all manual labor. In the scorching heat of summer, they still have to run regardless of their lives; in the windy, rainy, and snowy winters, they have to live like beasts of burden for the sake of livelihood. These days, the weather is bitterly cold, especially at night. The cold is biting. On the dead-like streets, under the dim lights, rickshaw pullers without customers wander around aimlessly. This scene is bleak enough!

There are regulations for rickshaw pullers to pull their rickshaws. On average, four people pull a rickshaw, day and night. (After the war, due to the curfew, there were some restrictions.) Each day is divided into two shifts, each shift being 12 hours: from 4:00 AM to 4:00 PM is one shift, and from 4:00 PM to 4:00 AM the next morning is another shift. The daily rental is 77 cents per rickshaw. After the war, because the population increased significantly, their business was better than before the war. The price for a day's work is about two yuan. This income seems not bad, but after deducting the rickshaw rental, the remaining one yuan is barely enough to sustain an individual. If there is a family, it is difficult. However, the proportion of rickshaw pullers with families in Shanghai is just under 95%. Among the rickshaw pullers' family members, wives, sisters, and daughters may be able to find some work to supplement the income, but the main livelihood still depends on the price of pulling the rickshaw. Currently, prices are high, and their lives are even more difficult.

Their lives are very simple. Single men live in the homes of those who lease out the rickshaws. Before the war, they did not charge rent. After the war, they charged a small amount of rent, about three or four cents per shift. Rickshaw pullers with families mostly build their own shacks in the areas beyond the borders of the Western Shanghai Concession. Some build them alone, and others build them together. Therefore, the shantytown areas of Western Shanghai have become the concentration points of rickshaw pullers.

There are many organizations that help rickshaw pullers with their lives. In the Public Concession, there is a Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society.

The post-war clubhouse of the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society is located across from the Great World on Edward VII Avenue. In addition, there are three branches in the east, south, and west. Anyone who has a rickshaw puller's license issued by the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau can become a member. Members do not need to pay any fees. The society's funds mainly come from the vehicle license fees collected by the Bureau. The Bureau donates 1.5 yuan for each rickshaw, which amounts to about 14,000 yuan per month. The main tasks of the society are divided into: administration, medical affairs, intellectual development, mutual assistance, insurance, dispute mediation, and improvement of living standards. It has held several campaigns in the past, such as health campaigns, epidemic prevention campaigns, safety campaigns, and adult education campaigns.

The society's investigation into the lives of rickshaw pullers has revealed several meaningful points. For example: Regarding knowledge, statistics show that among more than 5,000 people, 3,578 were illiterate, accounting for just under 71%. Regarding hobbies, the most common hobbies are smoking, drinking, and gambling. A small number of rickshaw pullers also smoke opium and heroin, spending all of their day's hard-earned money on these vices. As for the rickshaw pullers' origins, those from Yancheng, Funing, Tongzhou, and Taixian account for about two-thirds of all rickshaw pullers, with those from Yancheng and Funing being the largest groups.

In short, the purpose of the society is to seek the happiness of rickshaw pullers and improve their living conditions and to provide rickshaw pullers with various benefits and conveniences. Therefore, the society has established its own hospital to relieve the suffering of sick rickshaw pullers. In addition to running adult education classes, it also runs schools for their children. It also has a reading room, with newspapers such as Shen Bao, Xin Wen, Chung Mei, and various pictorials. It is said that many rickshaw pullers go to the reading room to relax after a hard day's work. This is probably due to the effectiveness of the adult education classes established by the society in imparting knowledge.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that, according to the society's report, it handled 3,990 mutual assistance cases this year, with rice cases being the most numerous, followed by funeral events. Currently, with rising prices, the lives of the large number of rickshaw pullers are bound to be threatened. At this time, it is hoped that the society will continue its previous spirit and seek welfare for these rickshaw pullers. If circumstances permit, it may be worthwhile to purchase foreign rice and organize sales at stable prices, which would not only benefit the rickshaw pullers themselves but also be extremely beneficial to society.

### Hawking Large Amounts of Counterfeit Money, Seven Men and Women Arrested, Interrogation Complete, Detained Pending Further Investigation and Interrogation

Recently, some local ruffians, facing difficult times due to high rice prices and the rising cost of everything, seized the opportunity to use counterfeit money to deceive the ignorant masses. The number of victims is countless. Wang Cheng, the Chinese detective chief of the Gordon Road police station, along with detectives Xu Decheng and Wu Dekui, learned that Liu Jizhong from Tianjin was one of the counterfeit money distributors. They sent an informant posing as a customer with thirty yuan of genuine currency marked secretly. They agreed with Liu Jizhong on the price and arranged to meet at a certain location on Beijing Road at 1:30 PM to make the exchange. Chinese and foreign detectives observed the area. When Liu Jizhong arrived and met the informant, he was arrested. Ten five-yuan counterfeit bills were found on his person. He confessed that his accomplice, Liu Xueke from Shandong, was hiding at No. 12, Lane 66, Xin Zha Road. Chinese and foreign detectives rushed to the address and arrested him, confiscating over five hundred five-yuan "Jiaotong" and "Zhongyang" counterfeit bills, along with his wife, Liu Sunshi, who was also arrested. Further arrests were made at No. 36, Taian Lane, Tiantong Road, and No. 57, Lane 41, Taoerfeisi Road in the French Concession, where accomplices Zhang Keqin from Shandong, Pan Wenbao from Pudong, Zhang Wangshi, a woman from Jiangsu, and Li Shengshi, a woman from Jiangbei, were apprehended. Another large quantity of over two thousand counterfeit bills was confiscated. A total of seven male and female suspects were arrested, and 2,660 five-yuan (farmer "Jiaotong" "Zhongyang") counterfeit bills were seized. All were taken back to the police station and detained separately. The next morning, along with the evidence, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case, stating that the defendants Liu Jizhong and Liu Xueke were repeat offenders, and the others were involved in activities such as consuming opium pills, receiving stolen counterfeit money, and soliciting customers. He requested an extension to investigate the main source of the counterfeit money. Subsequently, Chinese and foreign detectives reported the details of the case. When the evidence, the counterfeit bills, was presented, lawyer Li further stated that the ten yuan of genuine national currency given by the police informant to the first defendant, Liu Jizhong, for purchasing counterfeit money should be returned first. The court approved this. Judge Huang Risheng questioned each defendant and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further review at a later date.

### Woman Sues for Divorce, Debate Adjourned

Xiang Meixiang, a 25-year-old woman from Ningbo currently residing at No. 23 Ningbo Road in the British Concession, married Shen Jiaju, a 28-year-old local Catholic living at No. 45 Taoyuan Village, Lafayetter Road, on April 27, 1935. After four years of marriage, due to Shen's illness, they had never consummated the marriage. Xiang felt that her youth was wasted, her happiness was deprived, and there was little hope of growing old together. She hired a lawyer to file for divorce with the Second Special Court's Civil Division, seeking the return of her dowry of 12,000 yuan, alimony of 30,000 yuan, and monthly living expenses of 200 yuan from June 1, 1936, until the date of the final judgment. The initial trial resulted in a verdict against the plaintiff. Therefore, Xiang, dissatisfied, engaged lawyer Jiang Yiping to represent her and appealed to the High Third Branch Court. The respondent, Shen Jiaju, hired lawyer Tang Hao to represent him. Judge Tong Jishi repeatedly convened investigative hearings, summoning witnesses, family members, and relatives from both sides for questioning. After deliberation by the collegial panel, the debate was declared closed. The verdict was originally scheduled to be announced yesterday afternoon. However, it was learned that the presiding judge felt that the case was not yet fully understood and required further investigation before a final decision could be made to satisfy both parties. Therefore, at 3:00 PM yesterday, Presiding Judge Xia Quande announced the adjournment of the debate and scheduled a new hearing for further questioning and reopening of the debate.

### Vegetable Cakes and Three Kinds of Medicinal Materials Designated as Prohibited Exports

The Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that according to a report from Anhui Province on November [blank], the Wuhu branch of a certain Japanese trading company was purchasing large quantities of vegetable cakes for unclear purposes. The Ministry requested a reply on whether to prohibit their export. As vegetable cakes can be used as fertilizer and feed, they should be designated as prohibited exports. The Ministry has notified the Chamber accordingly. Additionally, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has designated cornelian cherries, corydalis rhizome, and yellow wax as prohibited export items. Since this has not been publicly announced, some merchants are still unaware. It is now known that the Ningbo Wartime Shipping Administration and the Zhejiang Customs have re-notified all medicinal material merchants, instructing them not to declare these items for export.

### Request to Stop Recruiting Female Postal Workers Not Yet Approved

Regarding the cessation of recruitment of female postal workers by the post office, although various women's organizations in this city have sent letters and telegrams to the Ministry of Communications and the Directorate General of Posts requesting reconsideration, there has been no result to date. Although the Ministry of Communications has telegraphed a response to the requesting organizations, their demands have not been adopted.

It was also resolved to increase capital by 500,000 yuan to expand business, bringing the total capital to 1,000,000 yuan.

### Nanshi "Citizen's Pass" to be Validated on a Regular Basis

Direct transportation between Nanshi and the concessions, after the French Concession opened the Xin Kaihe iron gate, suddenly became difficult because the "Citizen's Pass" for October, November, and December was not allowed to pass. This caused suffering for the public. Although philanthropists requested leniency, and it was approved for travel via the Nanmatou ferry via Pudong, this made the opening of the iron gate for the convenience of the people and the prosperity of the market pointless. It is now learned that after discussions between the Japanese Consulate and the Nanshi garrison, the "Citizen's Pass" issue has been clarified. From January 1, 1940, regardless of the month of issue, the "Citizen's Pass" can still be used for direct transportation through the Xin Kaihe iron gate.

### Social Miscellany

Arrested for Smoking Opium: At approximately 8:00 AM yesterday, the French Police Department received a tip that an opium den was being operated on the third floor of the Hengmao Li Kou Xiang Sheng automobile shop on Mintiniyin Road. Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched to the address and arrested Chen Baoxiang, a local lawyer, on the spot. A set of opium smoking paraphernalia was also confiscated. He was taken to the police station for further investigation.

Crushed by a Car: At approximately 8:45 AM yesterday, a Route 10 public bus, while traveling along Xin Zha Road at the intersection of Da Tong Road, accidentally struck a Taoist priest named Zhang Shaoqing (31 years old, from Changshu) who was walking along the side of the road. The bus wheel crushed his right leg bone, causing him to fall to the ground, bleeding profusely. Street police arrived and summoned ambulance No. 83, which took the injured man to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is said that his family lives at No. 5, Baoanfang, Gordon Road.

Fire in Pudong: A large fire broke out in Pudong yesterday evening. The flames were very fierce when viewed from across the river. It is said that the fire was at Lanni Ferry. As of press time, the fire had not been extinguished. Details are unknown.

Coal Gas Poisoning: Chuan Arui (40 years old), a native of Ningbo who works as a coal briquette peddler, and his wife, Ms. Miao, along with their four children, lived in a small room at No. 7, Sanditou, Yangshupu, Hongkou. The previous night (December 24), they were poisoned by coal gas from a coal briquette stove. This morning, they were discovered by a neighbor, and all four were found unconscious in bed. The youngest child, Maomao (only 6 years old), was already cold as ice. Chuan, Ms. Miao, and their 14-year-old eldest daughter, Jindi, were barely breathing. They were immediately taken to Hudong Hospital for treatment.

### Jian De Bank Bankruptcy Case: Both Parties File Appeals; High Second Branch Court Holds Investigative Hearing Yesterday, Adjourned Due to Lack of Time

Shanghai Jian De Commercial Savings Bank ceased operations and went bankrupt on December 7, 1934. On July 24, 1935, the First Special District Court ruled the bank bankrupt and appointed accountant Li Ding as the bankruptcy administrator. Lawsuits arose between creditors and bank directors and supervisors before and after the bankruptcy. For example, Director Xie Keming and others were fined between 1,000 and 1,500 yuan for making false statements during capital increase registration and for failing to file for bankruptcy when the company's assets were insufficient to cover its debts. They were also held jointly liable for compensating for the false capital of over 240,000 yuan. The registration of the limited liability company was also revoked by order of the Ministry of Finance and Industry. This spring, creditors Zhou Shougan, Xue Yifan, Wei Haijiang, and Wang Ruyao, along with lawyers Sun Zuji, Xi Mengqi, and Gu Kenfu, sued Xie Keming, Yu Yuanxiang, Yan Fanfang, and Qin Wenqun in the First Special Court, alleging that the bankrupt and the bankruptcy administrator colluded to represent false debts, hindering the rights of the bankruptcy estate and bankruptcy creditors, and privately collecting loans, altering accounts, and forging signatures. Judge Jiang concluded the hearing and sentenced Xie Keming and Yu Yuanxiang to one year of imprisonment each for jointly forging documents and one year of imprisonment each for continuous joint breach of trust. The two sentences were combined, and each was to serve one year and two months of imprisonment. Yan Fanfang and Qin Wenqun were each sentenced to six months of imprisonment for joint breach of trust, with a three-year suspended sentence. Both sides, dissatisfied with the judgment, entrusted their original lawyers to file appeals with the High Second Branch Court. The reasons for the appeal by the defendants Xie Keming and others were that they suffered heavy losses due to the Jian De Bank's bankruptcy and never purchased the claims of bankruptcy creditors to manipulate creditor meetings or fabricate creditor names to rig the election. If there were any deficiencies in the procedures of commercial transactions, they did not violate criminal law. They requested that the original judgment be revoked and that they be found not guilty. The reasons for the appeal by the plaintiffs Zhou Shougan and others were that the original court imposed too light a sentence on Xie Keming and others because the scams set up by Xie Keming and others not only harmed individuals but also harmed the entire society, causing people to lose confidence in banks and to fear bankruptcy, thus disrupting social economy. Their crimes were not driven by the needs of life. Now that their long-term conspiracy to manipulate the law and commit fraud has been exposed, they should be severely punished to deter the cunning and stubborn. According to the filings, the High Second Branch Court summoned both parties to court yesterday for an investigative hearing. However, due to the large number of cases and limited time, they were not questioned in detail. They were only briefly questioned about their age, address, and the simple reasons listed above. The hearing was then adjourned to a later date.

### Housing Dispute in Qing Yu Li: Judgment Postpones Eviction to the End of Next Year

Shanghai Women's Bank leased the houses in Qing Yu Li, Chongqing Road. According to the contract between the bank and the owner, the Poor Children's Education Institute, the houses had to be rebuilt starting on January 1 of this year. Otherwise, the bank would be subject to a fine of more than 200,000 yuan. Therefore, the bank filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court, requesting all tenants in Qing Yu Li to vacate the premises. The more than 3,000 tenants of Qing Yu Li argued that it was a difficult time to find housing and that the Women's Bank's decision to rebuild the houses at this time was inappropriate. The case has been litigated for years, and the tenants have lost in all three trials. Just as enforcement was about to begin, the tenants of Qing Yu Li suddenly found crucial evidence that had not been discovered in previous court hearings, namely that the Women's Bank had signed an agreement with the Poor Children's Education Institute during the second trial to extend the rebuilding period by three years. Therefore, rebuilding was not immediately necessary. They hired lawyers Yuan Yang'an, Su Jingqi, and Yu Chengxiu to file a petition for retrial with the High Second Branch Court, which was approved. The hearing has concluded. Yesterday morning at approximately 11:00 AM, High Second Branch Court Judge Han Zuzhi, along with Judges Shen Hongzhang and Qing Lan, convened court and announced the verdict. The original judgment was overturned. The plaintiffs in the retrial, Ping Jin'ya et al. (i.e., the Qing Yu Li tenants), were ordered to hand over the houses to the Shanghai Women's Bank at the end of December 1940. Therefore, the tenants were granted a one-year extension before having to move.

### Suicide Reports

Zhu Zhikang: The old man Zhu Zhikang, nearly sixty years old, was alone in Shanghai, unemployed, and unable to make ends meet due to the high cost of everything. At approximately 4:20 PM yesterday, he jumped into the Huangpu River from the No. 13 pier on the Bund in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, he was rescued by boatmen in the river and taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment before being sent to a charitable organization.

Song Junru: The young woman Song Junru, who lived at No. 10, Lane 355, Chengdu Road, suddenly took poison at home at 9:20 AM yesterday in an attempt to commit suicide. She was discovered and taken to the hospital for treatment.

Jiang Xiangji: Jiang Xiangji, 30 years old, from Nantong, recently felt unemployed and pressured by life. He was unable to support himself and decided to take his own life. On the afternoon of the 22nd, he checked into room number 10 at the Guotai Xinji Kueidian at No. 28 Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession. He drank poison that night and attempted suicide. The waiter discovered him at midnight and reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. He was barely alive and unable to speak. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but treatment was ineffective. He died at 10:00 AM the next morning.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: We have read your newspaper's December 20th edition, page 3, where it was mentioned in the rice market transaction column that rice prices were lower in the Wusong area and that our company, among others, was purchasing rice there, making a large profit of five to six yuan per dan on each transaction. There are no fewer than dozens of rice shops in the entire town of Gaoqiao, and our company alone cannot monopolize the market. Due to the sale of our entire inventory, we did go to Wusong to purchase rice once, but the rice price had already reached more than 30 yuan. Not only was there no profit to be made, but we also had to pay expenses. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. We respectfully request that your newspaper make a correction. Gaoqiao Yin Yitai, December 22.

### Overview of the Unified Entrance Examination for This Year's Universities (14)

(3) Problems with the System Itself: Some people believe that there is no need to implement the unified enrollment system at present. Their position is that enrollment is a type of school administration and should be handled by each school independently. There is no need for the government to coordinate it. In particular, universities have complex departments, and each department has its own characteristics. Independent enrollment can maintain these characteristics. Implementing unified enrollment and adopting uniform standards are insufficient to adapt to the characteristics of each school. This argument is not without reason, but upon careful study, it is not entirely true. Because each school enrolls independently, the standards are extremely inconsistent. Some have high admission standards, while others have low admission standards. Each acts on its own. Some particularly emphasize basic subjects, while others emphasize other unnecessary subjects, causing students to travel back and forth to take exams and prepare for various incompatible subjects. Regarding the exam questions, many schools set questions that exceed the high school curriculum standards, even using English exam questions, restricting answers in English, or, due to custom, not allowing answers in classical or vernacular Chinese. The difficulty of the exam questions varies greatly. Such situations cannot be considered appropriate. Furthermore, from the student's perspective, traveling back and forth to take exams at multiple schools, followed by exams at each school after the joint exam, is mentally painful. In the past, students from remote provinces and regions often hesitated to apply to their desired schools due to long distances or economic difficulties. Students apply to multiple schools, the examinees are the same, the subjects are similar, and the time is close, but the schools are different, the locations are different, the exam questions are different, the admission standards are different, wasting time, effort, money, and energy. During this time of war, transportation is extremely difficult. This enrollment method needs to be improved. Therefore, the trial implementation of the unified exam and the establishment of the unified exam system are necessary. However, the purpose of the unified exam is not entirely this. It is still to establish consistent standards and gradually improve students' levels. Unified enrollment is not about lowering standards and admitting more students, but about rationally adjusting university education based on actual needs.

(11) Personal Opinions

The above sections have described the significance of the unified exam, the handling situation, and general criticisms. In summary, the unified exam system itself can be said to have the value of existing and continuing to be implemented. However, in terms of methods, because it has only been implemented for two years, there are indeed many areas that still need improvement. I can say that the unified exam and the joint exam are equally important. The methods of the joint exam can be improved, but the system of the joint exam cannot be opposed. The unified exam is the same. Many people often suspect or even oppose the system itself because the methods are not well handled. This is unreasonable. But how many improvements are needed in the methods? This is worthy of our study. Now I will write my personal opinions below for the education community to discuss and refer to.

(1) Discussion of Admission Standards: The standard currently adopted by the unified exam is a single standard. In other words, it is a unified standard. Regardless of whether you apply to any group or any department, as long as the score is above this unified standard, you can be admitted. Its advantage lies in its uniformity. With unified standards, the level of students can be relatively consistent. But from another perspective, universities have different faculties and departments, and the disciplines are different, and the nature is even more different. Taking the College of Science as an example, the students that the Physics Department wants to recruit are slightly different from the Chemistry Department, and even more different from the Geography, Geology, Biology, and Psychology Departments. The Chinese Literature Department of the College of Liberal Arts is slightly different from the History and Sociology Departments, and even more different from the Foreign Literature Department. There are even differences in nature between colleges. Strictly speaking, it is best if each college has different exam subjects, or even each department has different exam subjects. Even if the exam subjects are the same for the same college or colleges of the same nature, the admission standards cannot be completely consistent. The most ideal standard is that each department has a specific standard, or at least each college should have a specific standard. The current method adopted by the unified exam is the grouping method. The exam subjects, Civics, Chinese, Foreign Language, and National History and Geography, are common exam subjects for the three groups. Mathematics is also compulsory for the three groups, but the content of the disciplines and the difficulty of the questions are different. The second group has the highest level, the third group is the second highest, and the fourth group is the lowest. In addition, the first group must test Foreign History and Geography, the second group must test Physics and Chemistry, and the third group must test Biology, or Foreign History and Geography, Physics or Chemistry. However, the first group includes many faculties and departments, such as the faculties of Arts, Law, and Commerce, the departments of Education in the Normal College, and the Department of Railway Management in the College of Engineering. The second group includes the various departments of the College of Engineering, the departments of Mathematics in the College of Science, and the departments of Physics and Chemistry in the Normal College. The third group includes the various departments of the College of Medicine and the College of Agriculture, the departments of Biology in the College of Science, and the Department of Natural History in the Normal College. Although the exam subjects are different for each group, the admission standards are the same for all three groups, which cannot be adapted to the special nature of each faculty and department. If departmental or college standards are adopted, there are actually too many faculties and departments, and the exam subjects are not determined by faculty or department, so there is no need. Moreover, each candidate has three different desired faculties and departments, and college and departmental standards cannot be applied. The best method is to adopt the grouping standard method, because the exam subjects in the same group are the same and are not restricted by the different desired faculties and departments of the candidates. The so-called grouping admission standards are of course different for each group. If there are many candidates in a certain group, exceeding the total capacity of each school, the admission standards can be appropriately raised. Conversely, if there are few candidates in a certain group or the general scores are not very high, the admission standards can be slightly lowered. This not only adapts to supply and demand and reduces the difficulty of distribution, but also adjusts the disparity in the number of students in each discipline. The disciplines are different, the nature is different, and the supply and demand of people are also different. Grouping admission standards can still maintain the standards of the same group, so it does not lose its unified purpose.

(2) Adjustment of the Number of People in Each Discipline: We have already seen the phenomenon of the disparity in the number of students in each discipline in the unified exam. Whether it is the examination application of the candidates or the number of people admitted, they are concentrated in a small number of faculties and departments. Science is the foundation of all sciences, but the number of admissions is particularly small. China is a country based on agriculture, and agricultural production is extremely important during wartime, but only more than 200 agricultural freshmen are admitted. The wartime and peacetime medical and health talents are in urgent need, but only more than 200 medical freshmen are admitted. The faculties of Arts and Law are related to the future of national culture, but because there are few applicants, the number of admissions is also small. Since the number of admissions is small, the result of the distribution is that there is only one or two people in one department, or even none. In order to respect the wishes of the candidates, the unified exam does not want to force those who want to study engineering to study agriculture or medicine, and because the groups are different and the exam subjects are different, it is fundamentally impossible to force them. Therefore, the faculties and departments with too few people have to be left to their own devices. In addition to allowing them to recruit additional students, there is no other way. But this method loses the spirit of unified enrollment. The only way to remedy it is to start by adjusting the number of people in each discipline. The grouping admission standard mentioned in the previous section is a type of adjustment method. The purpose of the unified exam is to coordinate the overall situation. The setting of faculties and departments, the increase or decrease of classes, the amount of academic places, and the distribution of the number of people should be coordinated in advance with a plan, taking into account national needs. If the number of people in a certain subject should be increased, or if a certain number of talents in a certain subject should be created in a few years, the government may set up a certain number of national scholarships for that subject to encourage students to apply. For example, this year there are particularly few students in science, agriculture, and medicine, and next year, more national scholarship places for these subjects can be set up to encourage students to apply enthusiastically. National scholarships should be more generous than general scholarships, and the number of places should be large. On the one hand, excellent students can be absorbed, and on the other hand, the number of people in each discipline can be adjusted according to needs. Otherwise, the disparity in the number of students in each faculty of the university is too large, and the opening of departments and classes is not economical, and talent cultivation lacks planning, which is not a blessing for the future of the country. Therefore, for the sake of the unified exam system itself and for the rationality of educational policy, this plan is indeed necessary to implement.

### Ministry of Education Order: Vocational Schools to Add History and Geography

(Chongqing, 25th dispatch) The Ministry of Education recently ordered the education departments of all provinces and national vocational schools that all vocational schools in all disciplines should add two courses, Geography and History, for one academic year each, with two hours of teaching per week, to be completed in the first and second academic years, so that students have a deeper understanding of the country and the nation, to enhance their patriotism. The increased teaching hours can be reduced by one hour each for teaching and practice hours in other vocational schools, except for agricultural vocational schools, which have separate regulations.

### National Peking University Students in Shanghai Association News

The National Peking University Students in Shanghai Association has been preparing and registering members for over a month. More than forty people have requested registration. However, the initiators believe that the number of alumni from various departments scattered in Shanghai should be more, given the university's long history. For the sake of connecting feelings and encouraging studies, it is necessary to expand the recruitment. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 23rd, a gathering dinner was held for all registered students, during which it was decided to continue recruiting members, and Mr. Pan Yongzhao and Ms. Lin Ming were designated to be responsible for all preparatory matters. All new and old students from the five departments of Liberal Arts, Science, Agriculture, Engineering, Medicine, Law, and Business can write to Mr. Pan at No. 5, Lane 3, Ruizhi Lane, Mette Hers Road, or Ms. Lin on the 3rd floor, No. 196, Lane 591, Jing'an Temple Road, to request registration. The association has also decided to formally establish before February 15, 1940, so unregistered students are expected to register as soon as possible.

Dr. Wu Zhiqian Memorial Service

Dr. Wu Zhiqian, principal of Shanghai Women's Elementary and Secondary School on New Dagu Road, was killed in the school on September 4 this year. The central government issued an order to commend and provide compensation. The family held a mourning ceremony at Huguo Temple on Mendelsohn Road yesterday. More than a thousand relatives, friends, and students of the doctor attended to pay their respects. A public memorial service was held in the afternoon, with Xu Zhengji giving the opening address. Wu Yizhi, a representative of the family, reported on the doctor's deeds during his lifetime. Students from Shanghai elementary and secondary schools sang memorial songs. More than ten groups, including the Shanghai Elementary and Secondary School Faculty Association, the Shanghai Women's Middle School Board of Directors, the Nantong Sojourners in Shanghai Association, and the Great China University Alumni Association, held a public memorial service. Mr. Ma Junshuo was invited to inscribe the main tablet, which was solemn and mournful. It is reported that the family, relatives, friends, and colleagues of Shanghai Women's Elementary and Secondary School, etc., still need to edit the doctor's posthumous manuscripts to commemorate him forever.

### Food: Large Quantity of Foreign Rice Arriving Today

The amount of inland rice arriving in Shanghai has remained scarce in recent days, but the supply of foreign rice is continuous. Another batch arrived yesterday, totaling 3,381 bags, transported from Hong Kong by the Taikoo Company's Yuezhou Wheel. It is reported that a larger amount of foreign rice is coming directly from Saigon today. The exact number will be reported after the ship arrives in Shanghai.

### Sugar Market: Raw White Slightly Loose, Chaoshan Sugar Production Controlled

Yesterday, the trend of foreign sugar was flat and slightly loose. The Association's set price for spot goods was 58 yuan for 24 raw white, 58.5 yuan for new goods at the main warehouse, 58 yuan for old goods, and 48 yuan for re-exported goods. Taikoo Che Bai B Mark was 58 yuan at the desk warehouse, 58.5 yuan at the west warehouse, CW Mark was 58.2 yuan, CX Mark was 57.8 yuan, DY Mark was 57.5 yuan, and HX Mark was 57.3 yuan. There was no change in red sugar and red molasses. Domestic sugar, such as from Chaoshan, has been lacking recent arrivals due to being controlled by a certain party, so Diaoging is quite tight. The Yuezhou Wheel continued to arrive with 986 bags yesterday, and samples may be seen today.

### Import and Export: Oil, Iron, Cloth Transported to Tianjin

On the 25th, 986 bags of sugar were imported from Xiamen. Today (the 26th), 1,800 cans of leather oil, 2,160 pieces of iron, and 184 pieces of piece goods will be transported to Tianjin.

### Coal: Indian Coal Market Calm

The Indian coal market is calm. The street is holding a wait-and-see attitude, and there is a lack of wholesale transactions. Traders are unwilling to lower prices and sell loosely due to high costs, maintaining the situation. The discounted prices of fellow traders are as follows: Calcutta lump coal is 115 yuan per ton, screened lump is 119 yuan, and bottom screen dust is 98 yuan. Delivery from the same industry's warehouse to the customer's home is subject to additional transportation costs.

### Northern and Southern Goods: Kuilan Bamboo Rises

Kuilan bamboo branches have been arriving in small quantities recently. It was heard yesterday that there were scattered shipments, and the price has risen by about five yuan compared to before. The trader's selling price is 140 yuan, which is more than 30 yuan higher than the first market.

### Piece Goods: Woolen Cloth Changed to Cash Transactions

The woolen cloth trade was still prosperous yesterday. The standard price remained firm. Various thick goods, such as overcoat woolen cloth, Melton, etc., Hume Four-Ply Harris, cashmere riding breeches, wide and narrow striped plain art camel fleece, and long and short-haired mohair, etc., were all selling well. However, shipments were temporarily suspended due to the Christmas closure. All large and small transactions are now conducted in cash because the end of the Gregorian calendar year has arrived, and most of the woolen cloth companies want to balance their accounts. The market prices are recorded below: Hunter & Son Trademarked Cashmere 13.500 Yulok Mau Yuan Tibetan Melton 6.500 Shun Quanlong Yuan Tibetan Melton 7.000 Bao Da Yuan Tibetan Plain Thick Woolen Cloth 8.600 Hua Bo Yuan Tibetan Thick Plain Woolen Cloth 13.500 Tian Xiang Bald Yuan Plain Thick Woolen Cloth 13.750 Xie Xin Tibetan Qing Valet Woolen Cloth 8.500 Da Long Shadow Grid Serge 5.250 Zheng Lun All Wool Black Charcoal Lining 3.600 Yin Feng First Class French West Lining 0.650

### Seafood: Western Sea Cucumber Supply Decreasing

Since the outbreak of the European war, the export of Western sea cucumber has gradually decreased, resulting in scarce arrivals. If this continues, it will be exhausted. It is found that the bottom accumulation here has also been gradually sold out. Therefore, the current colored sea cucumbers, such as red ginseng and jade ginseng, have risen by 20% compared to before. Other black yuan square ginsengs have also risen at the same time, and bald ginseng is even more scarce. Large sizes such as top bald and large bald have been out of stock, with only a small amount of medium bald needing to be sold for around 200 yuan, and small bald also sold for 180 yuan. At this time, the destination is flourishing, and the trend is unusually firm.

### Removing Barriers

‚Äî Mu Chang

I remember a scholar once said in public that there will always be barriers between people. He seemed to be hoping that everyone would sympathize with this barrier. But people seemed to be tired of hearing it and lacked the interest to sympathize. This does not just happen to prove that his views are correct, that is, he and his predecessors' sweeping articles have something in common - it turns out to be just narrating and not creating.

Of course, what he said also has a basis, such as people not being born together, not sharing the same pain or joy, you are you, I am me, laughter and sighs happening at the same time, and so on. However, it is difficult to convince people with only simple physiological reasons. Besides coral, wolves and jackals are no different, as if not only humans are like this.

Barriers do not not exist. At first, it was not like this, but later it was because of "life." The scholar also felt the loneliness and distress, and although his arguments were slightly similar to those of the former sages, most people did not welcome it because of the distance of "life."

Barriers must be removed by life.

In the past, there was a revolutionary who was sentenced to death. Many spectators came when he was executed. The spectators made a commotion, interspersed with sighs and laughter. The revolutionary was full of emotions and could not help but complain, composing a poem: "The torrential rain is east of the great river, the gale enters the sea; life and death are all for you, pity you do not understand!" This is very painful. However, the laughter of the spectators also had differences and should not be completely dismissed. - It is not necessarily understood by experts who study the history of love. The revolutionary's poem is just a kind of emotional self-deprecation. If I am so separated, it will not give a certain terrible impression and there is no danger of being beheaded.

Let life explain this.

Recently, these times and places have been celebrating Christmas very lively. This is because of the greatness of Jesus' personality, "sacrificing oneself, and loving everyone" - there is no barrier at all. Some people express a very harmonious view and will celebrate all night, but there is a limit of fifteen yuan per guest for a large meal, which shows that it is not very "philanthropic". Naturally, it is not easy to be "close" on the street. This has been a long time, but it has become more obvious after August 13. I don‚Äôt know how long this "forever" will last.

Enthusiastic people are indignant. It is proposed to prepare to give turkey to people on the street to eat, "share the joy with the people," but probably this generosity is wanted to be expressed at the banquet. After a while, "baked pork fillet with original sauce and roasted potatoes" and "white hat cake" are stuffed in the mouth, and one cannot help but remain silent for three minutes.

Returning to the outside and vomiting out the chicken bones, let the poor children thank them in unison; and on the one hand, mutter and scold "Judas" for being so careless; and make yourself believe that the chicken is really eaten by "Judas".

This is a "charitable" attitude.

If there are barriers, let them be "forever."

Do you want to mock me for holding the attitude of a reformist to speak out righteously? I dare not. To negotiate in between cups and plates, to make parallel talks, and say some seasonal words like "Jesus has his reasons" to save the declining fate of the butcher, this is also worthy of attention. Although there are reasons for its barrier, there are also means to get close and improve it.

Clever "Judas," you just eat your "velvet soup," it is okay to say that it will take three thousand years to remove the barriers between people, but you must first prepare more blood and gunpowder; throwing turkey legs and flirting eyes are in vain. Amen!

### A Day in the Mountains: Memories of Eastern Guangdong

‚Äî Xu Ye

A round of red sun slipped out of the pine forest, and the mist of the night disappeared without a trace. The wind swept across the river and the sand plain, and the quiet earth awakened in the sun.

A group of people who had just rushed through the night might be a little tired from walking more than a hundred miles. However, they knew that the unfinished road was doubly far, and they had to reach it within three days. The captain often shouted with his broad mouth:

"See who has good courage, we should hurry to the city today!"

Today, the captain especially showed his black eyes and swallowed a bite of steamed bun:

"Return to the team, set off for Sangpu Mountain at 6:10!"

Suddenly, the team stirred under the call to assemble.

"Attention--"

The command sounded like thunder, and the team suddenly became silent. The captain looked solemnly at everyone's clothes!

"Whoever speaks will be a turtle!"

A burst of laughter was mixed in the marching steps.

A steel stream under the white sun...

A sandy plain unfolded in front of us. Not far away were the slopes of the mountains. Jagged rocks stood tall. Rows of pine trees surrounded the mountainside. White clouds covered the peaks. . The dust stones resounded with mountain springs, and several goshawks circled in the dense forest.

The endless mountains stretched out of the plain, and the long, winding Rong River followed the end of the mountains and connected to the East China Sea.

"Isn't that the Rong River flowing?"

Turning a mountain path, we jumped out of the pine forest. Looking east, everyone was filled with unexpected joy:

"That river flows from the northwest. It will bring us lovely miracles. Someone said that Han Yu of the Tang Dynasty crossed the river here to go to Beijing..."

"Yes! The fields of tens of millions of residents in Eastern Guangdong all rely on it for irrigation!"

The 14-year-old comrade spoke with force, his face covered in sand and ash, sometimes even spitting saliva on the people in front of him.

Many people were "remembering the past." Someone recited a poem by Han Yu when he was an official in Chaozhou, and then someone sang a folk song to defend their hometown.

"To reach our destination, let's cross another mountain!"

A group of people laughed, and the captain also smiled, his eyes squinting...

Under the mountain, there were hidden green fields, scattered villages, and intermittent cooking smoke, the mountains and rivers of the motherland.

Here, the Rong River suddenly disappeared, and we continued to walk in the direction specified by the captain.

Boom!

It seemed like a cannon shot came flying over, and the captain ordered us to stop marching.

"No matter what the cannon sound is, we have to get to the city quickly. If the enemy invades, the headquarters will definitely receive intelligence, and everyone will be mobilized tomorrow... Now, run‚Äî‚Äî"

The iron stream moved quickly again.

Concentrating on the common goal, straw sandals rolled up the sand, and the front and rear were blurred and indistinguishable. A young comrade slipped and rolled over, and the dead leaves on the roadside seemed to dance behind him with the wind, and the goshawks flew out of the treetops, making strange cries.

"Almost there!"

The sun shone in the sky, and dozens of faces exchanged blood and fire...

‚Äî Jiang Xi

Have you forgotten? It seems like a distant age: Clear blue skies, covering fragrant earth. Have you forgotten? Those faded dreams: Flowers bathed in sunlight; Children chasing little birds, joyfully leaping. Have you forgotten? That black cloud beyond the sky; That sudden storm; That misfortune of the fields! Have you forgotten? We once soared side by side; The storm shattered my wings, and I fell in a distant, foreign land! Look: The clear sky is filled with thick clouds, The fertile land has turned to sand and gravel, Torrents flood the fields. Only withered leaves remain of the flowers, Darkness has replaced the sunlight, Children lie sleeping in ditches! The storm rages on unabated; The light is deeply buried; Ghosts roam the earth! The old nest has frozen into an icy cave under the storm. My companion! Will the cold damage your bones? My companion! Have you seen the clear sky after the storm, The warmth of spring after the harsh winter, The morning breeze after the dark night? My companion! I wish you -- do not forget your

old companion, the blue sky, the sunlight, prepare a welcome for their return!

### Clock

‚Äî Xu Yi

The mercury in the thermometer has dropped quite a bit, and the coughing has increased accordingly. The wind is blowing hard outside, and although there is still good sunlight, it never shines into the room.

In the cold house, the ancient clock ticks with a cold sigh; I see a hungry tiger invade my heart, biting me, biting my heart, and with it I remember many things.

Facing the old clock, I smiled bitterly.

The clock was passed down from my grandfather to my father, and from my father to me, and now it looks so old and lonely.

All day and all night it tells its life story, and afterwards it complains, pouting its lips and saying, "Now, look at how useless you are, look at how useless you are!"

Every time it chants its coarse, slow, and hoarse song, I glare at it fiercely. I feel that it is gnawing away at my life, urging me to get closer and closer to death.

I remember that night last year, how I struggled to carry it with me as I fled...

I also remember ten years ago, my father, with his dull hands and eyes, pointing to the old clock, looking at his children...

Restlessly, I paced around the room, and when I faced the clock, I was so frightened that I almost cried out: I saw my father's face, my grandfather's face, so stern, so angry!

Then the clock tells its grievance, it scolds me for not staying here, it says it should not be placed on this humble, dirty broken table, and finally, it roars: "You are not your father's son, you are not your grandfather's grandson!"

I covered up its curses with a cough, and turned my head away, towards the outside, towards the window; I saw the sunlight, the sunlight that had never shone into my room!

"Be a migratory bird," I stretched my body, packed my simple luggage, and carried the clock handed down from my ancestors.

Truly, tomorrow, I can't stand the cold anymore and I'm going to move again.

### Thoughts Inspired by My Daughter's Reading ‚Äì The Soviet Children's Theatre (Part 2)

‚Äî Li Feishu

Puppet shows, also known as wooden figure shows, are now rarely seen.

They can still be found occasionally in rural areas.) "Puppet" is also written as "Á™ü„ÄÄ". According to "Chicken Ribs" it is said: "Á™ü„ÄÄÂ≠ê is also called È≠Å„ÄÄÂ≠ê, making dolls to play, sing and dance, originally music for funerals. At the end of the Han Dynasty, it began to be used in festive gatherings. The Later Lord of Qi, Gao Wei, especially liked it, and Korea also had it. Now the word is written as ÂÇÄÂÑ°. "Fuweng's Miscellaneous Sayings" states: It resembles the ancient hero Kui Lei, hence the name." After reading this explanation, we know that puppet shows were originally funeral music, which, like the military bands at large funerals and the boys wearing white embroidered costumes and playing wind instruments, commonly known as "Little Ten Varieties," contains the meaning of finding joy in suffering.

As for the style of puppet shows, this illustrated magazine explains it very clearly! "Puppet shows imitate Chen Ping. Later generations followed his intention, creating various dramas that are quite pleasing to the eye! The large ones are moved by strings, called string puppet shows. In Shanghai today, the wooden figures are seven or eight inches tall, either slipped onto the fingers or operated with wooden mechanisms, and are collectively called wooden figure shows."

His so-called "imitating Chen Ping" is based on "Records of the Music Bureau": "Emperor Gaozu of Han" was surrounded by "Mao Dun" in Pingcheng. One side of the city was occupied by "Mao Dun's" wife, "Yan Shi," whose army was stronger than the other three sides. The fortress was cut off from food. "Chen Ping inquired and learned that 'Min Shi' was jealous, so he created wooden puppets and used mechanisms to dance in the battle formation. 'Lan Shi' worried that if they took the city, 'Mao Dun' would definitely take in prostitutes, so he withdrew his troops. Later musicians turned it into a theatrical prop, which is the puppet." If this section is correct, then the origin of puppet shows was in the besieged city during a famine, which is certainly an ominous thing! Moreover, the one offended by the puppet was the jealous "Yan Shi" lady, no wonder women and children like to watch puppet shows.

Every city and factory area in the Soviet Union has a children's theatre. Larger cities have as many as five or six. There are many types of plays performed. There are spoken dramas, operas, and dances, most of which are performed by children. The one we visited was a children's theatre in Leningrad that specializes in puppet shows. Their performance method is the same as our string puppet shows. However, "small as the sparrow is, it has all its vital organs." Regarding the script, set design, lighting, music, and the puppets' movements, costumes, etc., all the necessary conditions for the stage have been meticulously researched, handled with utmost care, and not neglected due to their small size, which is truly worthy of emulation.

The play performed that day was called "The Land of the Lazy." As the name suggests, it is a drama teaching people to "hate laziness and value diligence." The story is very simple, depicting a "non-worker's" indulgence in idleness and comfort, which leads to many evils and ultimately destroys himself. Another worker, through hardship and hard work, diligent struggle, achieves final glorious success. The characters' ages and environments are mostly based on children's lives, and common sense is infused into the structure of the play. For example, in the scene of traveling around the world, the Indian snake charmers, the Spanish bullfights, all enable children to gain a lot of common knowledge while being interested. In that scene, the depiction of our country is still quite polite, with only one playful child making many outrageous jokes in his wandering life!

New Film Introduction

### Riding the Winds and Waves

‚Äî Qi Hua

Watt saw the water boiling in the pot and invented the steam engine. Newton saw the apple falling to the ground and proved the theory of gravity. However, during their invention and confirmation process, they were met with ridicule from the short-sighted. These stories read in elementary school textbooks are facts known to everyone. American films have recently been competing to shoot this type of film, such as "The Struggle History of Bell, the Inventor of the Telephone," and the completion of great projects, such as "Iron Horse," which connected the western railways. Bringing these stories to the screen not only allows the older generation to know the hardships of the early pioneers but also encourages us to continue this spirit and achieve further discoveries.

"Riding the Winds and Waves" tells the story of the transformation from sailing ships to steam engines. David Greig and his partner John went through many twists and turns, faced ridicule, struggled hard, and finally completed the pioneering feat of crossing the Atlantic from London to New York.

Frank Lloyd is the director of "Mutiny on the Bounty," but his handling of "Riding the Winds and Waves" is obviously not as good as the former. First, he wrote about David and John's struggles in a flat and trivial way, without grasping a key highlight to emphasize it, so that the joy of the engine ship's first voyage could not reach an exceptionally lively and joyful state. Second, when the new ship encountered danger, he only strengthened the romance between David and Mary in the midst of a crisis. This leisurely handling method destroyed the final climax; moreover, the weaving of the scenes was not clear and concise enough, such as the old man's injury and the passengers' panic, which were not quickly glossed over, and David's desperate repair work was not described with sufficient effort. Thus, in the shot of David putting down the stone-like object and sitting down after the ship sailed, there was no sense of strength at all.

Van Heflin's acting is very calm, but because of the above-mentioned reasons, he did not have the opportunity to concentrate on acting. John Beal of Wilshire Ave did a very good job.

### "The Assassin" Sketches

The new Yi Hua film "The Assassin" has a loyal and tragic plot that can inspire people. Wang Yuanlong plays Jing Ke, and his performance of sacrificing himself for the country is very moving. At this time, this film will surely bring tears to the audience's eyes. This film has a great message, and we should not take it lightly.

In the picture, King of Qin (played by Zheng Zhong) rejoices greatly when Wang Jian's victory over Zhao is reported to Qin. The next day, he sets out to Handan, furious at the rudeness of the people of Zhao and slaughtering them cruelly! He then deposes the King of Zhao and imprisons him in a stone house in Fangling, and grants a title to Zhao official Guo Kai. The King of Zhao realizes Guo's true nature, but it is too late. The lower picture shows Hu Ji (played by Zi Wei). In the harem of the King of Zhao, there is a Hu Ji, the king's most beloved concubine, who can sing and dance. She wants the King of Zhao to leave Fangling, but is blocked by Guo Kai, so she is placed in the back garden to be offered to the King of Qin. The King is pleased by Hu's appearance and takes her. Although Hu misses her former master, she can do nothing for the time being.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

‚Äî Xu Muyun

Several Banker Enthusiasts

Mr. Ziheng and Boss Cheng are close friends. He obtains many of Cheng's tunes, and his natural good voice is comparable to Wang (Guifen) and Sun Juxian. Chang Shengsun was over eighty years old when he learned opera from him. Before the tenth year of the Republic, Shengsun also advertised himself as a Cheng School performer in old Beijing. At that time, he was only a young man, so the opera fans all ridiculed him as crazy, because his age was very far from Cheng's. He was innovating, which was self-deception. Although he had performed several times, the result was still a failure, and he disappeared into obscurity. When Shengsun was advertising himself as a Cheng School performer, Shuyan was working hard to learn Tan. Wang, Tan, and Sun were all disciples of Boss Cheng, so Shengsun, who was even more arrogant than Shuyan, not only looked down on his elder brother, but even ridiculed Lao Tan as a soft and decadent sound, not enough to compete with his Cheng School. After Shuyan became famous, he thought that no one in the current opera world could be on par with him. For example, when the record company asked Lanfang to record, the price was only 1,500 yuan per record, but Shuyan would not do it for less than 3,000 yuan per record. It would cost 50,000 yuan per month to hire Mei to perform together, but Shuyan would still be afraid that 100,000 yuan would not be enough. He always valued himself highly and looked down on everything‚Äîbut in the end, he was despised by his younger brother, which was also very unexpected.

The banker mentioned above who was infatuated with beauty, this actress is indeed very beautiful. Her name cannot be announced. She was originally from Beili, and later invited Xu Lanyuan to teach her Mei School operas, and Xu arranged a troupe for her. All the supporting actors, such as Jiang Miaoxiang, Xiao Changhua, and the martial arts staff, were all from the Mei Opera Troupe. They performed at the Zhonghe Garden. I have seen several of her performances, and they were not bad at all. Every time she performed, a certain banker would always book many seats to support her. Her residence was in the middle of Mishihutong, Xuanwai, and the banker's car was always parked in front of her door. (166)

### Lovers of Movie Stars

‚Äî Jiang

A reporter from the American film magazine "Movie Mirror" held an interesting test at Warner Bros. The topic was: "Do I love a man who is handsome, rich, sociable, skillful, knowledgeable, cautious, or a great lover?" The subjects of this test were, of course, female stars.

The test was done by voting. The voters that day included new Best Actress Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland, Zolina, Jane Wyman, and 18 famous stars such as Anne Shirley Dan.

The result was that skillful men received the most votes, a total of ten. Handsome men were the second most numerous, with five votes. As for cautious men, they were unfortunately not consulted by anyone.
