### Chamberlain's Reiteration: Determined to Wage War with Full National Strength; German-Soviet Pact Insufficient to Alter Anglo-French Objectives; Willing to Study Concrete Proposals

London: Following the establishment of the German-Soviet pact, Prime Minister Chamberlain reiterated the United Kingdom's policy in the House of Commons. All those present listened with bated breath. The Prime Minister stated, "Major events have occurred internationally in the past week. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop traveled to Moscow on September 26th, and the results were made public on the 28th. There are three main points: (1) Germany and the Soviet Union have made their fourth attempt to divide Poland and have signed an agreement mutually recognizing the definitive nature of the boundary line demarcated within Poland. This boundary line is far more advantageous to Germany than the temporary boundary line established during the previous military occupation. (2) The German and Soviet governments have issued a statement saying that various problems arising from the disintegration of Poland have been effectively resolved by both countries and that a lasting foundation for peace in Eastern Europe has been laid. For the benefit of all countries worldwide, the war between Germany and the Anglo-French powers should be ended. The German and Soviet governments should work together to ensure that this goal is quickly achieved. If this fails, the responsibility for continuing the war clearly falls on the Anglo-French powers. At that time, the German and Soviet governments will consult each other to determine the necessary measures. (3) The German and Soviet governments will establish a long-term economic agreement whereby the Soviet Union will exchange raw materials for German manufactured goods. Some quarters in our country therefore advocate that the British government must state its position. However, I do not see anything that would cause our country to change its attitude, which it deems correct. The German-Soviet pact has indeed altered the situation in Poland, but since Germany has not obtained its ultimate benefits, the British government has no need to change its objectives. In essence, we are now mobilizing all the resources and strength of the British Empire to wage a serious war, and there is no need to change course." (Havas, 3rd)

The Prime Minister then reviewed the reasons why Britain entered the war and the direct causes of the war, stating that while Poland was the direct cause of the war, it was by no means the fundamental cause. The fundamental cause of this war stems from the intolerable feeling of the Anglo-French powers towards the current state of affairs in Europe, believing that there are only two options: either to allow it to be freely exposed to danger or to mobilize their troops in peacetime to defend this freedom. The measures to be taken regarding the declaration by the Soviet-German powers concerning the end of the war are now ambiguous, but the content seems to propose certain peace conditions on the one hand and threaten dire consequences if these conditions are rejected. I cannot foresee the nature of this proposal, but I can immediately say that no intimidation will cause Britain or France to abandon the purpose for which they entered this war. No one wants to continue the war a day longer than necessary, but the great powers of Britain and France are determined to end tyrannical rule and to ensure that the oaths made by governments are forever kept. Many prominent diplomats were in the gallery during the Prime Minister's speech today, including Soviet Ambassador Maisky and Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi. (Reuters, 3rd)

Prime Minister Chamberlain further stated that any guarantees offered by the current German government are unacceptable. This government has never valued any commitments it has accepted, violating them whenever it is advantageous. There are countless examples of this. Now, if suggestions are made again, we will learn from the past and study and test them carefully. If the war does not need to continue, no one will want to wage it senselessly for a single day, but violent acts must be stopped and governments must be held accountable for the promises they make. On this point, the vast majority of public opinion in Britain and France is determined. Thereupon, Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a summary report on the progress of the war. On the Western Front, French troops have made further progress and occupied excellent positions from which to observe German troop positions. A large number of British troops have also arrived in France to fight alongside the French army. This deployment was quite difficult but has been successfully completed, which is most gratifying. In addition, our aircraft are reconnoitering enemy positions on the French front day and night and engaging in fierce battles with enemy aircraft. As for the activities of German submarines, our navy is actively searching and attacking them. We firmly believe that once submarine defenses are strengthened, this threat can be quickly reduced. Although German submarines have continued to operate near our shores in recent weeks, no British merchant ships have been sunk. This is due to the efforts of our navy. German submarines are now attacking ships of neutral countries at a greater distance. The threat posed by their pirate ships in the South Atlantic will be dealt with according to plan. (Havas, 3rd)

London: Reuters' parliamentary correspondent reports that members of parliament are completely indifferent to Hitler's "peace proposals." All parties admire First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill's broadcast speech on Sunday night and hope that Prime Minister Chamberlain will make similar, practical remarks today when expressing his views on the German-Soviet partition of Poland. Last night's discussion in the House of Commons on the determination expressed in the initial budget, and that the nation will bear unprecedented burdens, proves that all sectors of the country are not shrinking from the task already underway. The wartime budget bill was passed on second reading last night without dissent. (Reuters, 2nd)

British Prime Minister Chamberlain

### Hitler's Final Gambit: To Deliver a Speech Today; To Propose Peace Plan

Berlin: Hitler will give a speech in parliament this week, probably on Wednesday. Judging from appearances, his remarks will focus on foreign affairs rather than domestic affairs. It is generally believed that Hitler will deliver his last speech offering an open door for peace negotiations with Britain. If the proposal is rejected, a protracted war will be almost inevitable. According to Italian journalists, Hitler's proposed peace includes the establishment of a small-scale Polish buffer state by Germany and the Soviet Union, entirely inhabited by Poles. (Reuters, 3rd)

Paris: Reliable sources here have received credible information from the capitals of various neutral countries, stating that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano has already returned to Rome with German peace proposals. The content proposes that Italy should come forward at this time to mediate. Regarding this, although there are rumors that the peace proposal to be put forward by German leader Hitler will be accompanied by threatening words, it is actually unlikely to be the case. On the contrary, Germany may even make some reasonable suggestions. This can be seen from the country's recent diplomatic activities in certain neutral countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium. It is reported that Hitler's peace plan intends to have neutral figures present the proposals, so as to allow democratic countries to ostensibly gain a victory, and the accomplished facts within Poland will also be greatly embellished to ensure they can be recognized by the Anglo-French powers. But in any case, the Anglo-French attitude is firm and has been fully clarified by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier, and will never be changed because of this. In addition, Hitler originally invited Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to visit Berlin, but because Prime Minister Mussolini was unable to spare the time, he ordered Foreign Minister Ciano to represent him. (Havas, 3rd)

### Ciano Returns to Rome: Italian Cabinet Meets; To Discuss Mediating Peace Issues

Rome: It is heard that the Italian cabinet is scheduled to meet today. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano concluded his talks with Hitler yesterday and returned here at noon. (Reuters, 3rd)

London: According to a Rome Radio broadcast, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's decision to visit Berlin was to discuss solutions to the new European situation, and to establish a "just peace". The conditions are two: (1) Apart from the parts occupied by the Soviet Union, a new Polish state is to be organized as a German protectorate, and Germany's original demands are to be met. (2) A European conference is to be convened to resolve colonial and Mediterranean issues of great interest to Italy. (Reuters, 3rd)

Milan: According to the "People's Daily" diplomatic correspondent who accompanied Italian Foreign Minister Ciano on his visit to Berlin, the Italian government's attitude is of great importance and even decisive influence in localizing the European war. To its knowledge, Italy does not want the war to spread to the Danube region, the Balkan Peninsula, the western Mediterranean, or even western Europe. However, political negotiations have never been as difficult as they have been since August this year. There are many difficulties ahead, but Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is determined and will work tirelessly. (Haitong, 3rd)

Rome: Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaeta, wrote an article published in today's Italian Daily, making a peace appeal, stating briefly that Ciano's visit to Berlin only shows that Germany and Italy are in a new phase in a broader structure to achieve a fair peace. The warning appeals from Rome and Berlin, and timely initiatives, have been rejected, but Italy is not discouraged. Mussolini's peace movement, which began in early September, has not ended. Today is the time for the peoples and governments of all countries to seriously consider their ultimate responsibilities. Nothing irreparable has yet occurred. No country or government should reject a concept of peace based on fairness. (Reuters, 2nd)

Rome: Regarding the long talks between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and German leader Hitler in Berlin, the newspapers here today have added lengthy commentaries. Mussolini's mouthpiece, the famous Italian journalist Gaeta, agrees with the views of the "German Diplomatic and Political Communication" and believes that German-Italian policy is a cornerstone of peace. The fact that has already been achieved is that Germany has purged the evils of the Treaty of Versailles in Eastern Europe and achieved its goals. The universal tragedy has not yet unfolded. Germany and its allies want to end the war as soon as possible. This German reorganization is entirely based on the principles of peace and justice. This new order can keep Europe permanently peaceful. Governments should carefully consider their major responsibilities and should not lightly reject this peace. (Haitong, 3rd)

Berlin: General Goering's mouthpiece, the "Essen National Daily," published an editorial on the front page today, commenting on the rumored proposal that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will present a peace proposal on behalf of German leader Hitler. The newspaper declared two things: (1) The open cooperation between the leaders of Germany and Italy is a matter of course. (2) The declaration issued by Germany and the Soviet Union in Moscow is entirely the same as the hope Mussolini has held since the start of the war. Therefore, there is no need to hide the desire for peace of Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy, but it cannot be interpreted by the enemy as a war-weary plea for peace. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)

### Soviet Troops: Continue to Deploy Westward

Moscow: Soviet troops and military supplies are now continuing to be transported westward, and this is done openly, without any attempt to conceal it. Yesterday, a total of 210 military trucks, fully loaded with gasoline, and several others carrying soldiers and ordnance, departed westward from Moscow. (Havas, 2nd)

### Hoover Observes the European War: Britain and France Will Surely Be Victorious

New York: Former U.S. President Hoover, in a conversation with reporters from the New York World-Telegram today, predicted that Britain and France would not be defeated in this war. He said, "I believe the Allied powers will be able to defend their empire and they will be victorious. Even in the worst case, it will only be a draw. The war has only been going on for a month, but significant factors have gradually emerged. Although Britain and France are threatened by submarines and aircraft, they have the power to control the seven seas, and their manpower can defend France. They only need not risk lightly taking the offensive, because using their manpower to the full will eliminate other concerns." (Reuters, 3rd)

### Large Numbers of Soviet Reinforcements: Transferred to the Outer Mongolian Border; Japanese Army Suffered 18,000 Casualties in the Nomonhan Incident

Tokyo: Today, an army spokesman announced that although Japan and the Soviet Union have signed a ceasefire agreement, the Soviet Union has transferred large numbers of reinforcements and a large number of aircraft and tank units to the border between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo." Japan's losses in the Nomonhan Incident totaled 18,000 casualties. The losses on the Mongolian side are probably no less than those on the Japanese side. The spokesman also briefly described the process of Japan and the Soviet Union signing a ceasefire agreement, saying that Japan had consistently adhered to a policy of localization and non-expansion for the Nomonhan Incident. Due to the terrain, troop strength, and other factors, the two armies facing each other across the Khalkhyn Gol River were limited to small-scale battles. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Lithuanian Foreign Minister: Also Flies to Moscow; Latvian Foreign Minister: Has Met with Molotov

Moscow: After the Soviet Union expressed its willingness to conclude mutual assistance or non-aggression treaties with Lithuania, Latvia, and Finland, Moscow has now become a gathering place for politicians from the Baltic states. Latvian Foreign Minister Munters arrived here last night. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys was invited by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and will also arrive here today. (Reuters, 3rd)

Lithuanian Capital: Foreign Minister Urbšys, at the invitation of the Soviet government, flew to the Latvian capital at 9:30 this morning with his entourage, preparing to change to an airmail plane there and transfer to Moscow. People here generally believe that since the Soviet government invited the Foreign Minister in a friendly spirit, the country will not make territorial or military demands on Lithuania. (Havas, 3rd)

Moscow: After arriving here, Latvian Foreign Minister Munters is reported to have met with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov in the evening. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys is scheduled to arrive here at 5:30 p.m. tomorrow. Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu will continue talks with Molotov tomorrow. (Havas News Agency, 2nd)

Estonia: The Estonian President approved the Soviet-Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty last night, giving the Soviet Union practical control over the Gulf of Riga. The Gulf of Riga has a railway that leads directly to Moscow, allowing Soviet trade to have a non-freezing Baltic outlet. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet also approved the treaty. According to this treaty, the Soviet Union also has the right to establish several bases and airfields on the Estonian islands of Vormsi and Hiiumaa near the Gulf of Finland. (Reuters, 3rd)

Estonian Capital: The Soviet military delegation arrived here this morning, preparing to deploy the ports and naval bases that the Soviet Union has obtained for use in accordance with the recently signed Soviet-Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty. (Havas, 2nd)

Moscow: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union appointed Plenikov as the envoy to Norway. (TASS, 2nd)

### Turkish Military Delegation: Arrived in London Yesterday

London: The Turkish military delegation, led by Army Chief of Staff General Kazım, arrived here at 1:00 p.m. today. The British side was welcomed at the station by General Sir Edmund Ironside. (Havas, 3rd)

London: The Turkish military delegation is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow. According to responsible sources here, the Anglo-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement was initialed in the Turkish capital at the end of last week and will be formally signed in the near future. This is a major diplomatic victory for the Anglo-French powers. As for the mission of the Turkish military delegation, it is to discuss current issues and determine the various military measures that the three countries should take if the war spreads to the Mediterranean coast in the future. At the same time, the issue of the passage of Anglo-French warships through the Turkish Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits in wartime will also be put forward for discussion. (Havas News Agency, 2nd)

Moscow: Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu continued talks with People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov today and is reportedly awaiting instructions from his government. But in the afternoon, he met with British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds and French Chargé d'Affaires to the Soviet Union Payart. (Havas, 2nd)

Yugoslavian Capital: Informed sources here recently said that Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu's decision to go to Moscow was to negotiate with the Soviet authorities in the name of the Balkan Entente countries, in order to form a group of neutral countries in the Balkan Peninsula under Soviet auspices. The government of Yugoslavia is also said to support this matter, but as far as Yugoslavia is concerned, the Soviet side will probably demand the dissolution of all anti-Bolshevik White Russian groups and the revocation of the diplomatic treatment of the Russian Imperial Chargé d'Affaires to the South, Stremoukhov. (Note: Since the Russian Revolution, the Yugoslav government has not established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and has always recognized Stremoukhov's care of Russian interests, which has lasted for twenty years.) But according to official sources, the issue of the South recognizing the Soviet Union has not been discussed. (Havas News Agency, 2nd)

Editorial

### Abe's Policy and the Sino-Japanese Problem

Japanese Prime Minister Abe and Foreign Minister Nomura delivered speeches on domestic and foreign policy at the National Governors' Conference the day before yesterday. The content of the speeches was published in yesterday's newspapers. The so-called National Governors' Conference in Japan is where central government officials clarify policies and provide guidance on measures, and where local officials report on their duties and achievements. It is more about speaking than debating, but it is an important administrative gathering. This meeting was the first such gathering since Abe's cabinet took office. Abe came to power during a parliamentary recess, so he has not yet had the opportunity to deliver a formal political speech. The speeches delivered the other day were the first expressions of the new cabinet members at an important gathering. Being the first, they should be viewed differently.

The main purpose of convening this conference is to implement the National General Mobilization Law. In the future, it will force unprecedented sacrifices from the Japanese people and place unprecedented burdens upon them. The operation of this lies with the central government, but its effectiveness depends on the local governments. Therefore, local officials must be gathered together and instructed face-to-face, charged with absolute loyalty and sincerity. Examining the spirit and provisions of the mobilization law, it will channel every drop of the Japanese people's blood and sweat to the public treasury, and subject every action of the Japanese people to control. It is the third year of aggression, and the strategy of quick victory has proven to be a mere illusion. Therefore, the only option is to exhaust all resources and make a final gamble in a reckless war. Therefore, we should pay serious attention to the actual achievements and the extent of the suffering of the common people after Japan convened the National Governors' Conference and implemented the National General Mobilization Law. This is even more important than the foreign policy they announced.

Analyzing the foreign policy portion of the speeches by Abe and Nomura, there are six main points: (1) Acknowledging that "the international situation is complex and delicate, and its trends cannot be predicted," meaning it cannot be grasped. (2) Regarding "the handling of the China Incident and the construction of a new order in East Asia" as Japan's biggest current problem; all domestic and foreign policies, as well as attitudes toward third countries and the European war, revolve around this biggest problem. (3) Explaining that they "intend to devote themselves to resolving the China Incident," and that "the fundamental policy for handling the China Incident has already been decided and will not change with cabinet changes." (4) Stating that "what Japan seeks from China is political and economic cooperation between Japan and China," and that "the ultimate goal of handling the incident is the integration of Japan, China, and Manchukuo." (5) Reporting that the so-called "new central government" in China will "be established." (6) Japan will support the establishment of this so-called "new central government" and cooperate with it, but "it would be premature to consider the establishment of the new central government as the end of the incident." The Japanese claim that they "bear the mission not only of restoring peace" but also of completing the ultimate goal of "integrating Japan, China, and Manchukuo." Beyond these six points, regarding general international matters, they routinely declare that they have no intention of excluding the economic activities of third countries in China and express the hope that third countries will abandon their policy of assisting the Chinese National Government. From now on, "they intend to implement a multi-faceted and comprehensive foreign policy based on the established policy for handling the China Incident and after fully considering the situation in Europe; all closeness, distance, friendship, and enmity will be measured by whether a third country's attitude toward China suits Japan's wishes." Regarding Germany's past efforts to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the negotiation was declared "terminated." Regarding the Soviet Union, they plan to gradually resolve outstanding issues. Regarding the United Kingdom, negotiations with the UK have been declared "failed" because the UK could not agree to Japan's demands regarding the handling of specific issues in Tianjin. Regarding the United States, they plan to continue efforts so that the United States can fully understand Japan's "true intentions."

After analysis, please review further.

In Abe and Nomura's speeches, the parts concerning Germany, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States are quite bland, as it is inappropriate for superiors to exaggerate to subordinates. Regarding general international affairs, they expound their traditional Japan-centered approach, with no new suggestions whatsoever. Regarding China and the Sino-Japanese War, they largely remain within the confines of their aggression since launching the armed invasion. However, they have made relatively new explanations in response to the changes in the times. There are points that are worth criticizing. The speeches repeatedly mentioned a new order [tizhi], but never mentioned the new order [zhixu] that has been constantly promoted for the past ten months. The so-called "new order" has never had a defined explanation from the beginning. However, in terms of literal meaning, the so-called "new order" can still be regarded as a term in international affairs, while the so-called "new system" must be regarded as a new term that should only be applied to domestic political issues. Literalism may be despised by military men, but this is the first criticism. What does the term "new system" refer to? What does the term "political cooperation" refer to? In their speeches, we find a concise explanation, which is the so-called "integration of Japan, China, and Manchukuo." Moreover, is it intended that countries become one system? What does that mean? The alliance between the United Kingdom and France is recent, but we have not heard of an integrated UK-France system. Japan, Germany, and Italy have the Anti-Comintern Pact, but we have not heard of an integrated three-nation system. The United States is the leader of the Americas. In the recent Pan-American Conference, there was even a decision on economic cooperation and a decision to maintain neutrality and help each other. We have not heard of an integrated Americas. In the distant past, Sweden and Norway once shared a king, but we have not heard of an integrated Sweden-Norway. Austria and Hungary once shared an emperor, but we have not heard of an integrated Austria-Hungary. In short, independent countries have never been called an integrated system. Therefore, Japan's desired trinity clearly intends to operate in other occupied areas of China in the same way that it has operated in the four northeastern provinces of China in recent years, making them puppets. The American-style economic cooperation is far from satisfying Japan's ultimate goal. The Anti-Comintern Pact among Japan, Germany, and Italy is certainly not enough to explain international political cooperation. This is the second criticism. Regarding Japan's so-called "handling of the China Incident," Abe and others no longer say that they will achieve their goal through military force. Moreover, they no longer expect the so-called "new central government" that they will assist in establishing to end the Sino-Japanese War. Do we dare to incur the accusation of being overly sensitive or the ridicule of forcing an interpretation? Perhaps we can suddenly realize that the "China" in Japan's so-called "integration of Japan, China, and Manchukuo" originally refers to the "China" of the "new central government," and not the "China" of the Republic of China. Therefore, they have not made a single criticism of the opposing National Government of the Republic of China. This is also why they indicate that Japan will now devote itself to the "new central government" in the occupied areas and take this as the scope of their operations. This is the third criticism. Since September 18th, the Japanese cabinet has changed repeatedly, and the so-called "fundamental policy toward China" has varied in quality. Although Abe and Nomura's speeches were detailed, they mentioned the dates whenever they discussed matters. However, they were reluctant to specify the year, date, and person who announced the so-called established policy that does not change with the cabinet. This is a smokescreen to protect their image, a vague and empty statement. If we pursue it, it is like carving a mark on a boat to find a sword. However, Abe and Nomura have clearly stated political and economic cooperation and an integrated system. What else is there to pursue? This is the fourth criticism.

When people discuss Japan's peace or war, and Japan's sincerity or insincerity, opinions vary and cannot be completely the same. It is fine to stop at empty talk, but if discussing reality, then only using subjective views to interpret everything without obtaining objective facts to prove everything is extremely risky. Regarding what Abe and Nomura have expressed, we do not want to take it as a new target for criticizing aggression, but we sincerely hope that those who study the Sino-Japanese problem will take it as new material for argumentation. In our view, without presuming to infer how distant and vague the future of resolving the Sino-Japanese problem is, we can infer from what Abe and Nomura have expressed that Abe's cabinet in Japan is not one that can resolve the Sino-Japanese problem.

### Swedish Merchant Ship "Cannon" Sunk by German Submarine; Violation of Neutrality Outrages Swedish Public; Mysterious German Warship Discovered in South Atlantic; British Ship Sunk En Route to Brazil

Stockholm, Sweden - The Swedish merchant ship "Cannon," en route to Antwerp, Belgium, was sunk by a torpedo from a German submarine in the sea near Skagerrak, between Norway and Jutland. Eighteen crew members have been rescued by a Danish ship. The German submarine first took the captain of the "Cannon" and two other Swedes on board, then fired a torpedo and submerged for seven hours. This incident was published by a local newspaper after the captain of the "Cannon" arrived in Helsingborg. According to the captain, the "Cannon" was intercepted by the submarine on Saturday. The captain and two others were forced to board the submarine, while a German officer and three soldiers boarded the "Cannon," ordering the crew to take to the boats. At that time, a British submarine appeared, and the German submarine left the captain and the Swedes on board and submerged for seven hours. While submerged, the submarine fired three torpedoes. According to the German submarine captain, the torpedoes must have sunk the British submarine. The "Cannon" sank rapidly after being hit by the torpedo, so the German officers and soldiers who boarded for inspection did not have time to return to the submarine and spent the night in a lifeboat. (Reuters, 3rd)

Stockholm, Sweden - After the Swedish ship "Cannon" was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine, public opinion in Sweden was in an uproar, demanding that the authorities take strong measures to protect Swedish ships. Regarding this point, the organ of the Swedish Conservative Party, citing responsible sources, stated that the authorities, due to the acts of other countries in seizing the Latvian ship "Imanta" and attempting to force Swedish ships to leave territorial waters, violating neutrality, have decided to dispatch the navy in Swedish territorial waters to escort ships soon and will adopt more stringent measures to patrol territorial waters with aircraft. The Arlanda newspaper commented that sinking the ships of the Scandinavian countries cannot be said to have reduced Britain's ability to continue the war. So what is the purpose of committing atrocities against neutral ships? In this situation, it is inevitable for neutral countries to send naval vessels to guard merchant ships. If Sweden wants to maintain neutrality in its territorial waters, it must back up its words with force. (Reuters, 3rd)

Bern, Switzerland - The Zurich Daily News recently published a report from Stockholm, Sweden, stating that a German aircraft, flying over the intersection of Swedish territorial waters and international waters, attacked several Swedish national ships with machine guns, intending to force them to sail elsewhere for inspection. However, it was prevented by two Swedish aircraft. All those in the Swedish shipping industry were extremely shocked by these acts of violating neutrality. The government has instructed the ambassador in Berlin to lodge a protest with the German government. (Havas, 2nd)

Stockholm, Sweden - Today, the Swedish Navy Commander-in-Chief has warned all Swedish merchant ships that they must sail along the coastline within Swedish territorial waters before gathering for escort by Swedish warships. The warships' instructions must be strictly followed, and those who violate them will face serious dangers and suffer the consequences. (Reuters, 3rd)

London - News was received here a moment ago from Copenhagen, stating that a German armed fishing boat, which entered Swedish territorial waters without permission yesterday, was attacked by two Swedish aircraft and immediately sailed into international waters. (Havas, 3rd)

London - The British Admiralty yesterday issued a warning to Allied ships in the South Atlantic, stating that there is a mysterious German warship lurking in the area. The British ship "Clement" (5,050 tons) was sunk 70 miles off the coast of Brazil while en route from New York to Brazil. The crew have all been rescued and have landed at a port in Brazil. The Admiralty has not been able to confirm that the "Clement" was sunk by a German pocket battleship. Two of Germany's three pocket battleships are currently under repair. If the "Clement" was sunk by a German pocket battleship, then this pocket battleship must have slipped through the British blockade. News from the Brazilian side stated that the incident was caused by the German pocket battleship "Admiral Scheer." The location where the "Clement" was sunk is within the so-called "security zone" in the Pan-American Conference. The ship left New York on September 29th, bound for Brazil in South America, with a total of 48 people on board. (Associated Press, 3rd)

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - Sixteen crew members of the British merchant ship "Clement," which was sunk by a German submarine, were rescued today by the Brazilian ship "Itatinga." They were all in an open lifeboat off the coast of Brazil. According to the rescued, except for the captain, who was taken away by the German submarine, the remaining crew members escaped in four lifeboats before the "Clement" sank. However, apart from those rescued, the other three lifeboats have not been found despite searches. (Reuters, 2nd)

London - Regarding the discovery of an armed enemy warship in the South Pacific, naval critics claim that before the war, the British ships stationed in the Americas and the West Indies included the "Berwick," "York," and "Exeter," each equipped with eight-inch guns, and the "Ajax" and "Orion," each equipped with six-inch guns. Therefore, if one of the German cruisers "Admiral Graf Spee" and "Admiral Hipper" escapes the northern blockade and inflicts damage on the seas, the strength of the above-mentioned ships is fully sufficient to deal with it. Although it may take some time for the British Navy to search for a lone enemy ship in the ocean, today's Germany no longer has the facilities to maintain this kind of lone warship at sea as it did in 1914. At that time, Germany had many bases in the Pacific Ocean and had well-organized coal ships and supply ships, and there was also the Far East Fleet led by Admiral Graf Spee. (Reuters, 3rd)

Berlin - German naval officers announced yesterday that a German submarine encountered the Danish ship "Vendia" on September 30th and immediately notified it to stop sailing for a search by the German navy. The Danish ship attempted to evade the search, and the German submarine stopped it. The ship then attempted to ram the submarine. This behavior is a violation of international law. The submarine fired a torpedo and sank it, rescued the crew members who fell into the water, and transferred them to another Danish ship. (Haitong, 3rd)

### United States Continues to Recognize Legitimate Polish Government; Territory Occupied by Foreign Force; Cannot Be Considered That the Country Is Eliminated; Mościcki Will Settle in His Swiss Hometown

Washington - Secretary of State Hull stated today that the United States continues to recognize the Polish government, existing in accordance with the Polish constitution, and continues to appoint Biddle (US Ambassador to Poland) to the location of the Polish government. Biddle is now in Paris to be close to the Polish government. Poland is a victim of using force as an instrument of national policy. Merely occupying land does not eliminate the legal existence of a government. It is believed that Hull's careful wording is clear evidence that the United States recognizes that Germany has violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact. (Reuters, 2nd)

Bern, Switzerland - Former Polish President Mościcki and his wife, currently in Bucharest, Romania, plan to settle in Fribourg, Switzerland. The Swiss Federal Council has already approved their entry. It is noted that former President Mościcki originally obtained Swiss citizenship in 1908, before Poland's restoration. (Havas, 3rd)

### Germany Creates Puppet in Polish Border; Berlin Mourns and Celebrates Victory; Churches Ring Bells for Seven Days

Milan - According to the diplomatic correspondent of "Il Popolo d'Italia," who visited Berlin with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, the German government will soon establish a government in Poland. The correspondent pointed out that after the signing of the Border and Friendship Treaty between Germany and the Soviet Union on September 28th, all areas inhabited by Poles are located west of the demarcation line, that is, under German jurisdiction. This change in the demarcation line is clearly related to Germany's plan to organize a government. (Haitong, 3rd)

London - According to the German news agency, churches throughout Germany have been ordered to ring their bells for one hour every day for seven consecutive days to celebrate the victory of the German army's entry into Warsaw and to mourn the fallen soldiers. The German army entered the Polish capital yesterday without encountering any unexpected events. (Reuters, 3rd)

Berlin - The German Army Headquarters issued a communique this afternoon, stating briefly that the German army continues to enter Warsaw and is clearing prisoners of war and armaments between Warsaw and Modlin. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)

### Germany Distributes Leaflets in Denmark

Copenhagen - This morning, Germany began a large-scale campaign to distribute propaganda leaflets in Denmark. People throughout Denmark found leaflets printed with speeches by Hitler and Göring. Those printed with Göring's speech depicted a folded umbrella, and the other side depicted the same umbrella, but with its cover removed, revealing a sharp blade. The leaflets, printed in Danish, condemned the United Kingdom for causing various difficulties for neutral countries. (Reuters, 3rd)

### British Aircraft Drop Paper Bombs Over Berlin

London - The Air Ministry announced today that the attack on Berlin by the Royal Air Force on Sunday was an accident. When the German anti-aircraft forces discovered them, they were already preparing to leave for England. The raid by the British aircraft did not involve any bombing attempts and only dropped various leaflets. However, due to strong winds, the Air Ministry stated that they also did not know how many propaganda leaflets were dropped in Berlin. (Associated Press, 3rd)

### Frequent Troop Movements by Germany; Strengthened Defenses on the Western Front; Attack East of the Saar River Repelled; British and French Air Forces Active on the Front Lines

Paris - According to official news today, while Prime Minister Hitler was talking about peace in Berlin, 25 German divisions were sent to the Western Front in the past two weeks. To date, there are 50 German divisions resisting the French army. For the past four nights, large groups of German troops have arrived at the Siegfried Line, strengthening defenses between the Rhine and Moselle rivers. (Associated Press, 3rd)

Bern, Switzerland - Large numbers of German troops have been frequently mobilized in southern Baden Province, near the Swiss border. According to private sources, there are also many German troops near Lake Constance (on the German-Swiss border) and near Ulm (in southern Germany). (Havas, 2nd)

Berlin - A German Army Headquarters communique stated that the war on the Western Front is quiet, with only artillery fire and aircraft activity. (Haitong, 3rd)

Paris - The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 57, stating, "Yesterday, the enemy launched local offensives east of the Saar River and south of Saarlouis, but they were all repelled by our forces. The enemy artillery fired on our rear positions (located in Germany) east of the Saar River." (Havas, 2nd)

Paris - The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 58, stating, "Yesterday evening, the reconnaissance teams of both sides were very active." (Havas, 3rd)

Paris - The military operations on the Western Front are currently characterized by the most interesting feature of air combat. The strategy of gradually approaching German defenses, taken by the French army on the Western Front, has not yet developed. It is believed that British air force aircraft, cooperating with French aircraft, have repeatedly been successful in reconnaissance of enemy positions. The German High Command is therefore feeling anxious. The wording of the Allied communiques is cautious and concise, but according to observers, the British losses are extremely low in terms of the ratio of combat aircraft, while the German aircraft losses in these air battles are greater than those of the British aircraft. Allied aircraft are fighting German aircraft in the skies over the German front lines every day. It is heard that the German side is now making every effort to prevent the reconnaissance flights of British and French aircraft. In the past three or four days, the activity of German fighter aircraft has increased. In addition to taking valuable photographs of German positions, Allied pilots have also penetrated deep behind the main German defense lines for reconnaissance and obtained information. It is heard that this information has confirmed and supplemented in detail the news received by the French command that some German troops have been transferred from Poland to central Germany. It is heard that a part of these German troops is now less than 120 miles from the Siegfried Line, so they can enter the front lines in two or three days. (Reuters, 3rd)

Paris - According to "Le Petit Parisien," since the beginning of the war, the French army has occupied 400 square kilometers of German territory. It is heard that this is the estimate of military experts. (Associated Press, 3rd)

### The Stability of Changsha and Its Outskirts: Chinese Troops Achieve Success in Successive Battles, Recapturing Shangshih, Fulindianpu, and Liqiao; Continuing to Advance Towards the South Bank of the Miluo River; Also Recapturing Shiziling South of Fengxin

Changsha: Chinese troops in northern Hunan have recaptured key points such as Fulindianpu and Liqiao. On the 2nd, they first captured Shangshih, and that evening surrounded and annihilated most of the remaining Japanese forces in the vicinity. The Chinese army then took advantage of the victory to pursue and attack the Japanese troops who had retreated to the area of Malinqiao (30 miles south of Fulindianpu) and Qingshan (southwest of Fulindianpu). The Japanese troops were extremely disorganized and retreated north in disarray. The Chinese army then recaptured Liqiao at 2:00 AM on the 2nd, and taking advantage of the bright moonlight and stars, bravely advanced eastward, officially capturing Fulindianpu at dawn on the 3rd. Chinese pursuit troops are currently continuing to advance towards the south bank of the Miluo River. The defeated Japanese troops are in a very pathetic state, abandoning a large amount of baggage along the way. The Chinese army is simultaneously clearing the spoils of war and comforting displaced people. Amidst the sounds of victory, the military and civilians are becoming even closer. (3rd dispatch)

Chongqing: According to today's news from the Guilin branch of the military headquarters, since the Chinese army launched a counterattack on September 30th, the arrogance of the Japanese army in the battle for the outskirts of Changsha has greatly declined. Since the Chinese army recaptured Sanduoqiao, the Japanese troops in Qingshan have been under siege by the Chinese army. However, the fighting in the Sanduoqiao area is still ongoing today. Furthermore, since the Chinese army launched its counterattack, it has not only been able to cut the Japanese troops in the mountains northwest of Changsha into several sections, but also to rely on advantageous terrain to annihilate the Japanese troops in separate units. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)

Chongqing: Today, Chinese-language newspapers prominently published news of the counterattacks by Chinese troops north of the Yangtze River and in the Northeast. It is reported that Chinese troops on the highway northeast of Changsha and on the railway north of it launched a vigorous counterattack on October 1st. Important commanders personally went to the front line to supervise the battle. Chinese troops on the highway have captured Shangshih and forced the Japanese troops there to retreat northwest towards the railway. Chinese troops along the railway have captured Huanggongqiao (transliteration) northeast of Qiaotouyi and Lijiatang (transliteration) northwest of Fulindianpu. At the same time, Chinese mobile units are currently vigorously harassing the rear flanks of the Japanese army. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Chinese army stated this afternoon in a conversation with reporters that the current battle for Changsha is a re-enactment of the battle of southern Shanxi. The Chinese army will use the dense mountains northeast of Changsha to harass the Japanese troops currently advancing south towards Changsha, just as the Chinese army used the Zhongtiao and Taihang Mountains in southern Shanxi to prevent Japan from gaining a foothold in that area. The spokesman also reviewed the course of the battle in northern Hunan, saying that the Chinese army had built solid defensive lines on the south bank of the Xinqiang River and the Miluo River. However, after the Japanese army landed east of Dongting Lake, the western flank of the Chinese troops defending the Xinqiang and Miluo positions was threatened. The Chinese troops in northern Hunan did not retreat towards Changsha, but retreated southeast into the mountains northeast of Changsha, defending the Mufu Mountains. Now the Chinese army has built deep trenches and high ramparts in the mountains near Zhulin, Pingjiang, Xiushui, and Liuyang, allowing the Japanese army to advance south towards Changsha, and then continuously attacking the flanks of the Japanese army along the highway. Although the Japanese army decided to attack Changsha with more than 100,000 troops, it has now been blocked north of Changsha due to the Chinese army's mobile strategy. This strategy of the Chinese army has proven effective in the battle of southern Shanxi. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

Gaoan: After Ganfang was recaptured by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops retreated northwest to Hanqiao Zhaocun. The Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the afternoon of the 2nd, resulting in a fierce battle. Chinese officers and soldiers fought bravely, disregarding their own safety, and killed countless Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops were terrified and released a large amount of poison gas in an attempt to reverse the situation. The Chinese army launched an attack through the poison gas, and the bloody battle continued until the evening. Another unit of the Chinese army attacked Shiziling (south of Fengxin) on the morning of the 2nd, engaging in a fierce battle with the "Jun Fukui Unit" for three hours, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops fled in disarray, and Shiziling was declared recaptured. (3rd dispatch)

Guilin: A certain unit of the Chinese army crossed the Jin River on the evening of the 2nd and attacked the Japanese troops on the north bank, engaging in a fierce battle with the Japanese army near Yuantianjie (55 li southwest of Nanchang) until the morning of the 3rd. (3rd dispatch)

Changsha: The Japanese troops in northern Hunan have suffered heavy casualties after being severely attacked by the Chinese army for several days. They are confined to Gaogiao, Shangshih, Malinqiao, Qingshan, Fulindianpu, and other places.

Hengyang: According to a phone call from Changsha at 4:30 PM, the Chinese army recaptured Ganfang, west of Shangfu, on the evening of the 1st. The Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties. When the Chinese army launched its attack, it captured three puppet soldiers who claimed to be from the Northeast. Because the Japanese soldiers were afraid of death, they were used as the vanguard. The Japanese army's defeat in this battle was extremely pathetic. Not only were the Japanese corpses not collected, but the wounded soldiers were also abandoned on the battlefield. (2nd dispatch)

Hengyang: According to a phone call from Changsha at 1:00 PM, the Chinese army is in an advantageous position in the outskirts of Changsha. The defensive lines have become increasingly stable in the past two days. Yonganshi is still in the hands of the Chinese army. (2nd dispatch)

### Situation in Central Hubei: Chinese Forces Gain the Upper Hand

Fancheng: The Chinese army in central Hubei is launching attacks on the Japanese in two lines, encircling and outflanking them. Although the Japanese troops are able to rely on their fortifications to defend their strongholds, their lines of communication are cut off by the Chinese. In the current situation in central Hubei, the Japanese are still at a disadvantage. A certain unit of the Chinese army is pressing forward at Yonglong River and Yangjiaze, besieging Qianjiang. The Dawangmiao area southwest of Zhongxiang has also been occupied by the Chinese. The area east of Jiukou Bridge, Huangjiaji, and the mountains north of Yangzi in Zhongxiang are all areas where brave Chinese soldiers are active. The Japanese troops in the Zhongxiang area have not yet escaped the control of the Chinese. In northern Hubei, a certain unit of the Chinese army surrounded Zhe River on the 29th, destroying many sections of the highway. Two other units advanced towards Jingzhong, one approaching Suicheng and attacking Jiangjiagang north of Sui on the night of the 29th, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers and capturing many rifles. The Chinese suffered slight casualties. At the southeastern foot of the Tongbai Mountains, the Chinese have occupied Luotuodian, reaching the area east of Ta'erwan, driving out the Japanese outer defenses and bombarding them with mortars, causing heavy casualties to the Japanese. East of the Tongbai Mountains, the Chinese are advancing. (3rd dispatch)

Although the moonlight was bright tonight, there was a thick fog. After the five waves of Japanese planes entered Sichuan, they proceeded west through the fog. The first two waves passed Chongqing and did not stop, continuing to fly west to attack Luxian and Yibin. The third and fourth waves approached the sky over Chongqing and circled for a long time before continuing to fly west. After that, the fifth wave of Japanese planes also followed, passing Chongqing and heading west. These five waves of Japanese planes then successively bombed Luxian and Yibin in western Sichuan.

Those who did not leave the city when the first alert was issued spent most of the night in air raid shelters. The Japanese planes bombed in three waves, and the last wave of bombing caused the most damage, as most people thought the air raid was over. However, the bombs all landed in empty fields half a mile outside the South Gate, causing very few casualties.

### US Fleet Sails to Hawaii: Nothing Less Than an Armed Demonstration Against Japan; Major General Sekine Acknowledges US-Japan War Unavoidable; Argues US Should Sell Guam to Japan

San Pedro: Naval officials announced last night that 45 warships sailing to Hawaii today will be stationed there permanently, and that the US fleet's patrol area will include the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to the equator. Tokyo newspapers have all published news of the US fleet's movements, calling it a "military demonstration" against Japan. Rear Admiral Andrews, who commands the fleet sailing to Hawaii, is a well-known naval strategist. Rear Admiral Andrews is traveling on the aircraft carrier "USS Saratoga," which carries 80 aircraft. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)

Manila: In its editorial today, the Philippine "Hochi Shimbun" predicted that the Far East would soon become a major theater in world history for a second time. Although the attention of the general public in the world is currently attracted by the European war and its diplomatic activities, in the Far East, judging from the fragments of news we have obtained, there is also a drama of similar greatness waiting to be performed. For example, the US dispatch of the aircraft carrier "Langley" and 14 aircraft here, and the continued dispatch of 45 warships to Honolulu, should be regarded as one preparation. At the same time, Singapore's air power has doubled compared to a few weeks ago. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)

Tokyo: Most Japanese newspapers today prominently published news that the US naval authorities have dispatched 45 warships to Hawaii for exercises, with headlines such as "US Armed Demonstration Against Japan." Retired Japanese Rear Admiral Kaneseki Gunpei published a fierce article in the "Bungei Shunju" magazine, suggesting that the US sell Guam (an American outpost in the Pacific, 1,300 miles from Yokohama) to Japan. Rear Admiral Kaneseki criticized the US attitude towards the Sino-Japanese War as "hypocritical." He said, "The US often uses humanity and fairness to promote its views on world events, but in fact, its policy is greedy and selfish, the same as its policy during the First World War. The tense relationship between the US and Japan hinges on whether the US will risk war with Japan over the China Incident. Some people think that the China Incident can be resolved without a US-Japan war, while others assert that the China Incident cannot be resolved without a battle between the two Pacific powers. I believe that the US will not risk war with Japan, because the US will gain more than it loses." Rear Admiral Kaneseki continued, "Japan must abolish the Nine-Power Treaty, which was signed under 'bad air and oppression,' just as Japan abolished the Washington Naval Treaty, which permanently limited Japan's naval inferiority." However, the abolition of the Nine-Power Treaty depends entirely on the US attitude towards Japan. If the Washington administration does not change its current hostile attitude towards Japan and the Japanese people, it will inevitably lead to a US-Japan crisis. There is no need to deny this. The Japanese people need not be alarmed by the US-Japan crisis, because Japan has already prepared a policy to deal with emergencies. Some people are deeply afraid of war in the Pacific, but they can rest easy, because the Imperial Navy can compete with any navy in the world. When the Japanese Navy controls the western Pacific, it will not be easy for the US fleet to attack Japan. I hope that the US can abandon its suspicions about Japan and adopt a more moderate attitude to resolve the issue of American rights in China through negotiations with Japan. If so, Japan will respond to the US with pleasure, and then the issue of the rights of both parties in China and the issue of security after the complete independence of the Philippines will be easily resolved. After the rights of the US and Japan are clarified, the need for fortifications on Guam can be eliminated. I think for the sake of US-Japan friendship, it would be better for the US to sell Guam to Japan, so that Japan can defend it and protect the peace of the Pacific." (3rd Associated Press dispatch)

### Neutrality Act Amendment: Fierce Debate in US Senate; Pittman Speaks Out that Arms Embargo Should Be Abolished; Says US is Partly to Blame for Japanese Army Massacres in China

Washington: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman today moved in the Senate that the arms embargo clause of the Neutrality Act be passed. One of the most important debates in US Congressional history has begun from this point. The chamber and the gallery were extremely crowded, with hardly any space. Listening to the debate between Pittman and Republican opponent Senator Borah, (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Pittman, the original proposer, first gave a speech explaining the proposal, and strongly argued that the arms embargo clause must be abolished. His key words were: "Some say that prohibiting the sale of arms to the belligerent countries can make us not bear any responsibility for the killing of human lives during the war. This kind of idea is actually wrong. Taking the Far East war as an example, we have indirectly participated in the Japanese army's killing of Chinese people in Chinese territory." This is because Japan is buying various raw materials from our country to manufacture military supplies for fighting against China. After Pittman finished speaking, Republican Senator and member of the Foreign Relations Committee Borah followed with a speech, vehemently opposing the abolition of the arms embargo clause in the name of the opposition, believing that this move would only make it impossible for the United States to refuse to provide assistance to the democratic countries in Europe. During Borah's speech, Pittman repeatedly interrupted to refute, and the two sides fiercely debated. For example, Borah once said that the current Neutrality Act is "neutral" in wording, but Pittman said that this law is not neutral in practice. In addition, although this law prohibits the shipment of arms to the belligerent countries, the Soviet Union, Italy, and even Romania can still purchase military supplies from the United States to ship to Germany. The meeting was temporarily adjourned at 3:45 PM, and the meeting will continue at noon tomorrow, and it was decided that meetings will be held daily from noon to 5:00 PM. It has not been determined when the debate will end. (2nd Havas dispatch)

### Mr. Pittman's Speech

Speaking in his capacity as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Pittman stated, "The existing arms embargo clause in the Neutrality Act favors Germany and obviously discriminates against other belligerent nations. The amendment proposing to abolish this clause is one of the most important bills ever submitted to Congress by the government. It can enable the United States to avoid being drawn into the vortex of the European war. At this moment, the entire world is threatened by the scourge of war across the Atlantic, the severity of which is unprecedented in human history. The world is in a state of panic, filled with fear and doubt. However, if we can adhere to the principles of international law and prevent our people from putting themselves in danger, then there seems to be no sufficient reason to fear repeating the mistakes of the last European war and being drawn into the whirlpool of war." Those who oppose the abolition of the arms embargo often believe that Anglo-American shipping will be controlled by Britain and France in the future, and therefore allowing arms exports would only benefit these countries. However, Germany is a continental power and can obtain arms supplies from Italy, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Romania, and other countries. Wouldn't prohibiting arms exports simply benefit Germany? Moreover, when the United States implemented the current Neutrality Act, Germany could still obtain various arms from the United States through other neutral countries. President Roosevelt has issued a declaration stating that he will do everything possible to keep the United States out of the European war. I firmly believe in this declaration by the President and dare to assert that even after the Neutrality Act is amended, the President will never abuse the powers conferred by this law. In short, even if we restrict belligerent nations from purchasing arms from our country, we may not be able to maintain neutrality or fairness. This is abundantly clear. As for the navigation of our own ships overseas, we must prohibit them from carrying goods to belligerent nations. If our ships do not carry goods for belligerent nations, and all belligerent nations know this, then these countries will have no excuse to attack American ships on the high seas, resulting in the loss of American sailors' lives. It must be remembered that the reason the United States joined the war during the last European war was precisely because American sailors were illegally and inhumanely harmed on the high seas. Who knows if Germany, using the pretext that its submarines could not safely surface to intercept contraband carried by other countries' merchant ships, might re-implement its 1917 policy and indiscriminately launch attacks when necessary? Who knows if, after a protracted war, the belligerent nations, facing increasingly dire circumstances, might not resort to any means to destroy other countries' ships and their contraband? Some say that prohibiting the sale of arms to belligerent nations can absolve us of any responsibility for the wartime killing of human lives. This view is incorrect. Taking the Far Eastern war as an example, we are indirectly participating in the Japanese army's killing of Chinese people in China, because Japan is purchasing various raw materials from our country to manufacture arms for use in the war against China.

Furthermore, the amendment I propose also advocates granting belligerent nations commercial credit loans of up to ninety days. This is a perfectly legitimate approach, as it is practically equivalent to cash transactions and does not conflict with the Johnson Act. (Note: The Johnson Act stipulates that countries that have not repaid the principal and interest on their war debts cannot borrow money in the United States, but former Attorney General Cummings ruled in 1934 that the Johnson Act does not apply to ordinary commercial transactions.) After the Neutrality Act is amended, our country's shipping industry will inevitably be affected to some extent. To compensate for the losses, shipping companies can appropriately increase fares on Pacific and South Atlantic routes. "In short, no matter what impact the new Neutrality Act may have on our country's shipping industry, no patriotic American citizen will oppose making this sacrifice. Weighing the pros and cons, rather than allowing our merchant ships to carry goods for belligerent nations at risk, it is better for our government to bear the losses caused by suspending this trade. Therefore, our merchant ships must suspend this business during wartime, without a doubt," he said. (Havas Dispatch, 2nd)

### The Stubbornness of Isolationists

Isolationist leader Senator Borah, a Republican, rose to oppose the bill and read a lengthy prepared speech, saying that Europeans now see the US authorities' proposal to amend the Neutrality Act as an attempt to help Britain and France resist Nazism. "If we change the law and can transport arms to supply Britain and France to meet their urgent needs, then I do not know how we will refuse to send troops to relieve their plight if Britain and France face even greater needs in the future. We may have to respond at that time, which I am very doubtful about." The reasons for the original Neutrality Act were America's desire not to be involved in European disputes and the humanitarian sentiment against providing weapons to belligerent nations to seek profit. As for the claim that the arms embargo has not been effectively implemented, that is not true, because arms manufacturers are now very active in trying to repeal the current embargo, which shows that the embargo is indeed effective," he said. (Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)

### 300-Mile American Coastal Zone Designated as a Safety Zone; Patrols to Be Shared by Relevant Countries; Pan-American Conference to Issue Declaration

Panama City: Yesterday, the Pan-American Conference passed a resolution designating a 300-mile zone along the American coast as a "safety zone." Henceforth, belligerent nations will not be allowed to take any action within this area. The resolution will be known as the "Declaration of Panama." This "safety zone" includes the area within 300 miles of the American coast. The countries attending the Pan-American Conference will each be responsible for patrolling within their respective areas. The implementation of this declaration will enable the American countries to avoid war and maintain neutrality. (Associated Press Dispatch, 3rd)

Panama City: The Pan-American Conference held a closed-door plenary session today and decided to issue a declaration of neutrality and the "Declaration of Panama" (i.e., the declaration on delineating a "continental sea" around the Americas as a safety zone), which will be submitted to a public plenary session this evening for a vote. The "Declaration of Panama" proposes that the warships and aircraft of the American republics patrol the "continental sea" to protect the shipping of those countries from attacks by the belligerent nations' vessels. The boundaries of the "continental sea" on the Atlantic side extend from the point where the Canadian Federation borders the United States, passing through the United States, Cuba, the British Bermuda Islands, to the Central American Sea. The width of the "continental sea" is 300 miles, sloping south to the intersection of 60 degrees west longitude and 20 degrees north latitude, including the French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique. Then, along the South American coastline, it meanders south to the Brazilian Sea, where the width is again set at 300 miles, to the intersection of 24 degrees west longitude and 5 degrees north latitude, which is the point closest to the continents of Europe and Africa. Further south to the Argentinian Sea, the width is set at 100 miles, and then it turns into the Pacific Ocean at Cape Horn, the end of South America. The width of the continental sea on the Chilean Sea is set at about 50 miles, going north to the coasts of Ecuador and Colombia, and then widening its width to include the Galapagos Islands within the "continental sea." From there to the north, it restores the width of 300 miles, and ends at the border between the United States and the Canadian Federation. As for the declaration of neutrality, it involves the issue of wartime contraband and proposes the establishment of a permanent body in Washington to resolve various issues related to neutrality. According to a representative of a certain country, this declaration must express a desire, within the realm of possibility, to show that the American countries sympathize with those countries that defend the ideals of democracy, in order to subtly hint at Germany.

### The Active Chinese Army in Hangjiahu; Chinese Troops from the South Bank of the Qiantang River Head to Jiahu; Japanese Troops Search for Pro-Justice Newspapers in Shanghai

Hangzhou Correspondence: In the past week, Zhejiang's Chinese army's units, such as the ×× Division, have crossed the Qiantang River from somewhere and arrived in the vicinity of Hangzhou, gradually advancing towards Jiahu and other areas. The current situation in the three areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou is investigated and recorded below.

Hangzhou Area

When the Chinese army's ×× Division on the south bank of the front line Jiangnan was crossing the Qiantang River the other day, it was spotted by the Japanese army, who immediately fired with machine guns. The Chinese army immediately responded calmly and was bombarded with small steel cannons by the Chinese army on the south bank. After a fierce battle of about three hours, the Chinese army was able to reach the north bank safely. Along the Hangyu Highway, large and small battles have occurred frequently in the past three days. On the Mid-Autumn Festival, six trucks were seen transporting Japanese soldiers' corpses that were transported from Yu following the highway to Hangzhou. Near Haiying Qibao and other places, Chinese positions were invaded by the Japanese army on the Mid-Autumn Festival. The Chinese army's ×× Division's ×× Brigade cooperated in a fierce attack, and after a half-day of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was completely wiped out by the Chinese army. The Chinese army along the Jinghang National Highway has been in contact with the Japanese army many times in the past half month. For example, on September 20, the Chinese army in the Sandun area attacked the nearby Japanese garrison, and after a day and night of fierce fighting, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed. On the morning of the 23rd, four trucks of Japanese soldiers passed through the Sanqiaopu area. The Chinese army in the area had heard the news in advance and ambushed themselves by the roadside. When the Japanese army drove past, they threw explosives. All Japanese soldiers and vehicles were destroyed. Later, the Japanese army in Hangzhou heard the news and sent troops to search, but found nothing.

Jiaxing Area

The Chinese army in Haiyan has recovered the important base of ×× that fell last year. Therefore, those who cross the Qiantang River to western Zhejiang all follow the waterway there. In Jiaxing, after the assassination of the puppet governor Shen Hanqing, the Japanese army stationed in He ordered the puppet acting governor Dong Kaixiong (Fengwei) to strictly organize the baojia system and restrict his subordinates from going out. Recently, he even dispatched troops to guard the key points of the city. Although the Japanese army was so vigilant, the Chinese army still repeatedly approached the city walls in the past three days. On September 30, the Chinese and Japanese armies had contact near the Dongzhakou outside the eastern gate of Hejiao. Many Japanese soldiers were killed. The Chinese army in the Guojie Township area also attacked the Japanese airfield late at night on the same day. The two sides fought fiercely until dawn, but the outcome is unknown. There have also been battles in the four suburbs of Pinghu for several days. Therefore, the residents in the area can hear clear gunshots every night, but the location is unknown. The Chinese army near Tongxiang has not been able to move due to environmental reasons, but there have been more than 20 great victories in the past half month due to the Japanese army's invasion. The number of Japanese soldiers in Jiashan is very small, so the four villages have not been disturbed recently. From the 1st of this month, it has been widely rumored inside and outside the city that the Japanese side will dispatch a large number of troops to the four villages, such as Xitang and Tianrenzhuang, to carry out the so-called "pacification" work, so people's hearts are very panicked.

Huzhou Area

Last month, the Chinese army in Huzhou attacked the first town of Nanxun in the county in four directions, killing and capturing many people, and recovered the town. The Japanese army in Wuzhen is now completely surrounded by the Chinese army and has no way out. Therefore, it is said that the Chinese army has started the annihilation war since the day before yesterday. The situation is unclear due to traffic conditions. Since September 30, the Chinese army in the four suburbs of Xinshi has been ordered to dig field trenches and various defensive works. The Japanese side sent four or five aircraft to hover and reconnoiter near the town for a whole day.

The Japanese army in the occupied areas is very strict in searching for newspapers published in Shanghai that uphold justice. If anyone carries them or uses them to wrap objects to the occupied areas, they will be executed if they are found. In Jiaxing, many people have died tragically because of this.

### The Chinese Army in Nantong Encircles and Attacks Jinsha and Yuxi; The Battles Are Fierce for Days

Nantong Correspondence: Since the encirclement and attack by various troops in this area began on September 17, the troops have been engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army every day. It is estimated that at dawn on the 18th, the × battalion of the × regiment attacked Yuxi Alley. They fought for five hours. Because the Japanese army stubbornly resisted with fortifications and the Chinese army had no heavy weapons, they failed. They reluctantly withdrew at 11:00 AM. At 12:00 AM on the 18th, Battalion Commander Feng personally led the Second and Third Companies and the Fourth Company of the Nantong Regiment to attack Yuxi again, destroying all the barricade gates on the main roads. Finally, the Japanese army retreated into the basement. At the entrance of the basement, they fired machine guns indiscriminately. After a stalemate for four hours, they were unable to succeed. They had no choice but to burn down the Japanese barracks and withdraw. At 3:00 PM on the 19th, more than 100 Japanese soldiers from Jinsha came to reinforce Yuxi. They were ambushed by the Chinese army's Feng Battalion three miles northwest of Yuxi. After a fierce battle of three hours, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. In the above three battles, it is estimated that one Japanese officer and four soldiers were killed and a dozen were wounded. The Chinese army also suffered four or five casualties. The troops of the × Brigade besieging Jinsha attacked the north gate of Jinsha at dawn on the 18th. After two hours of fierce fighting, they failed and withdrew to the periphery of Jinsha. At noon on the 19th, when the Japanese army in Jinsha dispatched to Jinyu Town, they fought fiercely with the Chinese army for several hours, killing several Japanese soldiers. The brigade also suffered some casualties. All areas are still surrounded by the Chinese army.

### The Chinese Army in Haining Counterattacks Chang'an; The Puppet Propagandists Arrested

Haining Correspondence: The Japanese army in Haining only occupies the three traffic checkpoints of Chang'an, Xieqiao, and Xiashi. The puppet county government is still located in Xiashi. The other day, the Chinese army's ××× Division suddenly took advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness to counterattack Chang'an, setting fire to the Japanese army's office in the Chang'an District. The Japanese army fled in a panic to Xiashi, with five or six killed or injured in the retreat, and more puppet police officers killed. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway tracks east of Chang'an were dug up by the Chinese army for 20 zhang. Therefore, passengers to Shanghai are blocked and have to return because the train only goes to Jiaxing. Shen Shengwu and Shen Hongji, three propagandists sent by the puppet governor Tan Yuqing, happened to be in Chang'an and were reportedly captured by the Chinese army.

### The Japanese Army in Suzhou Constructs Military Warehouses; The Construction Materials Are Very Simple

Suzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army's Hiroya, U, Ishikawa, and other units in this county recently forcibly encircled the open space from Qianwanli Bridge to Xinmin Bridge, and drove iron wire into the ground all around. They also lured hundreds of Chinese workers to work day and night to speed up the construction of military warehouses. The work is extremely mysterious, and the nearby streets are often placed under partial martial law, prohibiting traffic. According to those working inside, the construction materials and construction methods used by the Japanese army are very simple. Based on this, it can be seen that the Japanese army's power in Su is difficult to last. At present, only two warehouses for gasoline and automobiles have been built (the former is built north of the Gengsheng Hospital, and the latter is built opposite the Huayuan Hotel). It is said that other warehouses for food, firearms, and clothing will be completed in mid-month.

### Li Mingyang Talks about the Solid Defense of Northern Jiangsu; The Period of China's General Counteroffensive Is Not Far Away

Li Mingyang, the commander-in-chief of the Lu-Su-Wan Border Area Guerrilla Forces, recently returned to his headquarters after inspecting the defenses on the front line. According to his talk, "China must go through the stage of a major counteroffensive to achieve final victory. Based on the observation of various situations at home and abroad, China is not far from the period of general counteroffensive, so final victory is also imminent." He continued, "When he first arrived in northern Jiangsu last year, he saw that the local troops had different organizations and no case systems, which had little effect on the war of resistance. If a counteroffensive order was issued, it would be difficult to unify command. Therefore, he gathered guerrilla teams with patriotic righteousness and considerable discipline, rectified and reorganized them, and prepared for war day and night. As of today, the strength has exceeded 100,000, and they are densely deployed in the key points of various counties in northern Jiangsu. There are the First Column Commander Ding Jutang, the Second Column Commander Yan Xiuwu, the Third Column Commander Chen Caifu, the Fourth Column Commander Lu Zhoufang, and other units, winding for hundreds of miles, with layers of guns and artillery and soldiers everywhere. The defensive works are very solid, and if the enemy invades, they will be given a major blow."

### The Price of Paper in Hong Kong Rises Sharply; Affected by the European War, the Source Is Short; British Newspapers Implement a Reduction in the Number of Pages

Hong Kong Correspondence: In the past few days, the price of paper in Hong Kong has soared, with the price of newsprint for printing newspapers rising the most. The price has doubled compared to before the European situation changed. According to sources in the paper industry, the most common sources of newspaper paper used in Hong Kong in the past were Germany, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Finland, and Canada, with Germany and Czechoslovakia being the main ones. For example, the German Paper Company and the Chinese Commercial Bank of Czechoslovakia accounted for a very large proportion of the newspaper supply in Hong Kong in the past. Since Britain and France declared war on Germany, the source has been cut off. Moreover, in the past two months, the number of newspapers shipped to Hong Kong by German and Czech paper companies has been reduced to a very small number.

As for the reasons for the soaring wartime paper prices in Hong Kong: (1) Due to the shortage of sources, only Norway and Finland have goods coming to Hong Kong. The arrival of future goods will also take a considerable amount of time. (2) According to the approximate estimate, the stock of paper in Hong Kong can only be used for three months for the entire port. (3) Even if there are goods coming, the price of paper may not be able to recover, because the current costs, freight, and insurance fees have increased significantly compared to the past. (4) The source is scarce, and people are scrambling to buy wholesale, which is also one of the reasons for the rising paper prices.

The current price of each knife (printing 1,000 large newspapers) is between HK$7.5 and HK$8. In the past, each knife was only HK$3.6, and the price has doubled. Therefore, the cost of an ordinary newspaper, formerly about 3.67 cents, is now 6 or 7 cents.

At present, in order to remedy the business situation due to the soaring paper prices, the major newspapers in Hong Kong are mostly planning to reduce the number of pages. For example, the English-language "Hong Kong Telegraph" has reduced one page, and the "Deccan Herald" is also planning to reduce one page. As for the small newspapers with only one page, they are planning to increase the selling price from one cent to two cents, or reduce a large page to half a page.

### Trends in Teacher Education in Various Countries (V): The United States Also Practices a Laissez-Faire System

(2) The United States of America has three types of institutions for training elementary school teachers: (1) normal schools; (2) normal departments of senior high schools; and (3) various training courses. Normal schools recruit high school graduates, and some offer studies of one to four years, with two years being the norm. Women make up the majority of students. In 1930, there were 66 state-run normal schools, 26 municipal normal schools, 47 county-run normal schools, and 58 private normal schools. In addition, there were 34 specialized teacher training schools, including 6 private ones. The trend is for normal schools to decrease and specialized teacher training schools to increase. In other words, the length of study at normal schools is being extended, so that students will not only be elementary school teachers in the future, but will also be promoted to become supervisors, heads of academic affairs, and secondary school teachers. Most normal schools have attached elementary schools, or local elementary schools are used as substitutes, for students to practice. The subjects and courses are determined by the school authorities themselves, so the talents and experience of the principals must be abundant. At the same time, the curriculum standards are not determined by government offices, but by teacher conferences or academic affairs director conferences, so uniformity cannot be expected. The teacher training institutions for secondary schools in the United States can also be said to be extremely complex. To mention the main ones: (1) The College of Education of the University recruits graduates from the old-style four-year secondary schools and graduates from the new-style senior high schools, studies for four years, and awards a bachelor's degree, making them secondary school teachers. The School of Education of the University of Chicago in Chicago and The Teachers College of Columbia University in New York City are typical of this type of teacher education. For the convenience of students' observation, experimentation, and research, these schools also have attached kindergartens, elementary schools, and higher elementary schools. In addition, in smaller universities, there are also those who only require students to attend courses on education law and teaching methods to issue a teacher's license. (2) Specialized teacher training schools have the same admission qualifications as other universities, that is, they also recruit graduates from old and new-style senior high schools, so those who complete the curriculum are awarded a degree, but the length of study varies depending on the subject. For example, the technical subjects such as music and home economics are three years, while the academic subjects are four years. State-run schools also have attached kindergartens and elementary schools, and it is a common phenomenon to use other secondary schools for observation and field practice. Although teacher education in the United States and Britain is valued by their people, the schools themselves are not subject to any restrictions from the state, and the acquisition of qualifications for elementary and secondary school teachers is not in an absolutely dominant position. The reasons are: (1) Most of the elementary and secondary schools in the United States and Britain are established by private individuals and local authorities, and it seems difficult for the central government to intervene in the appointment of teachers. Therefore, the restrictions on normal schools also have to be relaxed. (2) The lives of the people in the United States and Britain have a special British and American style, which covers and drives them, making them a national characteristic, which is sufficient to unify their national consciousness. Therefore, they are happy to let teacher education be free. (3) The country is intoxicated with democratic thought for a long time, and it is not easy to implement overly coercive and rigid legal systems. Therefore, we firmly believe that any system is the product of its historical background and social environment. Otherwise, it will not grow up.

### Finance - Bearish Sentiment Envelops Foreign Exchange Market - Exchange Rates for British and US Currencies Consistently Lengthen - Hong Kong Electronics, Qiao Zhifu, and Others Compete to Dump

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) opening with longer rates, with British currency at 25 points long, calculated at four shillings, and US currency at 4375, or six yuan sixty-eight seventy-five. Other currencies also uniformly lengthened. In the black market, British and US currencies initially opened slightly softer but later, due to the lingering negative sentiment from the previous day and the incessant dumping from Hong Kong electronics and four major speculators, coupled with heavy sales by Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu and non-professional Datong Merchant, despite some buying by foreign firms such as Hua Bi, Ander, Holland, and Chinese banks, the position remained several times oversupplied. Consequently, the market weakened considerably. By noon, British gold had hardened to four shillings six two five, and US currency to seven yuan seventy-five. In the afternoon, Sassoon and Jewish merchants resumed selling, causing the market to continue to harden to four shillings six eight seventy-five for British gold and seven yuan eighty-four thirty-seven five for US currency. The day closed at four shillings six eight seventy-five and seven yuan eighty-one twenty-five, respectively, with British currency longer by seven one eight seventy-five and US currency cheaper by two five compared to the previous day. Although Sha Hua and others absorbed some, there was a temporary softening, but demand could not overcome supply, so it was difficult to sustain. The trend for October initially showed a greater degree of looseness than spot, once seeing a squeeze, but then gradually separated, with the looseness similar to spot. Trading was brisk throughout the day.

Sha Hua Once Came to Close Positions

The morning began with London’s large strip, near-term sharply down one point two five, far-term steeply down one point four three seven five, New York silver prices down one two five, London gold fixed, exchange rate British to US, to Shanghai, to France all flat, US to British down one two five, to Shanghai up one point, to France down half a point, Central’s posted rates as usual, banks morning opened spot selling prices, British gold four shillings half, US currency seven yuan five three one two five, compared to the previous close, British slightly tight zero one five six two five, US slightly soft zero three one two five, although Chinese money changers and others closed positions after opening, it was not affected as certain foreign firms were willing to supply. Money changers closed positions, buying US dollar bills from a certain bank at seven yuan two five and three one two five, followed by Chinese merchants closing positions, buying October British gold from a certain bank at four shillings five three one two five, and October US currency at seven yuan five six two five. Datong also sold October US currency at seven yuan five six two five to a foreign firm. As HSBC’s rates were revealed, British, US, and other currencies uniformly lengthened, and the white silver balancing tax was revealed to have plummeted by seven points. From then on, Hong Kong electronics and Chinese-Western speculators raced to sell, and Japanese banks and Jewish merchants also came to dump, although the scope was smaller, foreign banks and Chinese banks still had some appetite, but the position ultimately couldn’t match it, so the market weakened sharply. Hong Kong electronics Chinese merchants and foreign Datong certain banks successively sold spot US currency to Chinese banks and foreign firms from seven yuan five six two five, up to seven five, at the same time Hong Kong electronics, Sassoon Japanese banks and Qiao Zhifu and others dumped spot British gold to Chinese banks and foreign firms from four shillings five six two five, up to six two five. At around 10:10, Chinese merchant Sha Hua suddenly seized the opportunity to close positions, and the seller's willingness to supply weakened, so the situation temporarily softened, Sha Hua bought spot British gold from a foreign firm at four shillings five six two five, and spot US currency at seven yuan six two five. Later, foreign firms’ selling prices were asking four shillings five three one two five and seven yuan five nine three seven five. At around 11:00, Chinese-Western speculators’ selling intention resurfaced, so the situation again became loose and hard, Sassoon sold spot British gold to foreign firms at four shillings five nine three seven five and six two five, followed by a Chinese merchant also selling October US currency to a certain bank at seven yuan six eight seven five, and spot US currency at seven yuan seventy-five. Later, foreign firms also sold October US currency to a certain bank, competing, hardening to seven yuan eighty-one twenty-five. Extending to the noon close, banks spot selling prices, British gold four shillings six two five, US currency seven yuan seventy-five.

Position Ultimately Felt Oversupplied

After the market, Sassoon and Jewish merchants continued to dump, and foreign firms, having profited, also had a selling appetite, so the potential hardened further, Sassoon, Qiao Zhifu, and Youli and others dumped spot British gold to foreign firms at four shillings six two five and six eight seventy-five, followed by Qiao Zhifu selling spot US currency to a foreign firm at seven yuan seventy-five and eighty-one twenty-five. Later, US currency at its hardest had shouted past seven yuan eighty-four thirty-seven five. Extending to the late close, banks spot selling prices, British gold four shillings six eight seventy-five, US currency seven yuan eighty-one twenty-five, October British gold four shillings six two five, US currency seven yuan six eight seventy-five. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot British loose by one seven one eight seventy-five, US hard two five, October British long one five six two five, US cheap two five.

Yesterday's cash cooked red black market situation, although the foreign exchange loosened quite severely, and certain gold shops profited by arbitrage, the gold price only fell by one ten yuan, so the settlement price was increasingly squeezed with foreign exchange. According to the evening close calculation, British gold was only three hundred and thirty-six yuan away, and US currency was only four hundred and fifty-seven yuan away, because certain gold shops and others would fiercely absorb whenever it was small (or passed to Hong Kong gangs, or passed to certain Chinese banks). The whole day generally first fell and then turned stable, after breaking the four thousand yuan barrier, it returned.

At 10:20, the foreign exchange trend turned soft, and certain gold shops and certain silver buildings and securities gangs successively advanced, so it sharply rebounded, once reaching four thousand and sixty yuan peak. At noon, the foreign exchange returned to loosening, and after noon it decreased to four thousand and fifteen yuan. The situation was slightly calmer after noon, although the foreign exchange was still loose, and certain gold shops continued to arbitrage (it was heard that it was switched to foreign exchange), but securities gangs and money changers still had good appetites, so it struggled between four thousand and five yuan and four thousand and thirty-some yuan, resulting in a close at four thousand and fifteen yuan, trading was still smooth, about one thousand six hundred-some taels, silver building ornaments gold ultimately posted down five yuan, customs gold and others still flat.

### Yarn Flower - Coarse Yarn Actual Sales - Still Have Transactions - Fine Yarn Has Already Retraced -

Yarn market turned towards the path of softening, probably because the foreign exchange black market loosened, at the same time the market sometimes had a kind of catching the wind and grasping the shadows talk especially made people’s hearts trance and unsettled, the market situation still entered the territory of being hesitant, probably all because of the general operators manufacturing snatching the hat transaction, as for the guest side they also folded their hands and do not move, Hong Kong gang was restrained by remittances activity, purchasing power greatly diminished, so for ten count coarse yarn they were slightly buying assembled spot, other groups were very few lively, the mainland Jiangzhe provinces, recently because the Japanese yarn price was expensive, changed purchasing Hua yarn more, but twenty count cones and coarse yarn were smooth. Also, the other day forty-two count five strand price had been reported one thousand and twenty yuan, this yarn price was afraid of not being correct, we are correcting it.

Another message said that Shanghai port foreign cotton transactions, were still called lively yesterday, the Pingguo’er selling price was one hundred and thirty-six yuan, West India one hundred and seventy-some yuan, US cotton transactions were very quiet, no transactions had been heard, for many days, because the United States starting ships for the Far East were rare, it was difficult to determine cargo holds, these days Tongzhou arrivals have been very many, yesterday more than three thousand bales from Tongzhou arrived in Shanghai, because of this the White Block selling price was difficult to turn firm, yesterday it was only sold for one hundred and sixty-seven yuan.

Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton market, was weak from the morning, because there was a lack of buyers, the cotton price fell six or seven pounds of sound, then also because many sold, and many settled, the market situation could not turn firm, resulting in the closing price dropping six or seven pounds of sound compared to the above day, India yesterday stopped market, the forecast slightly rose more than one Lo Robi remainder compared to the above day, Egyptian cotton market was very handsome, yesterday it strongly rose more than seventy sound, Liverpool rose four shillings.

The current yarn morning opening, the market was not removed from a dispersing aura, actually owing to the lack of activity in current sales transactions, Guangdong gang thoughts were flat, some had transactions for coarse yarn, but the amounts were few, twenty counts yarn not only had no appetite, on the contrary they spat it out, from this situation the market was lacking in vigor, the opening call price was very high, but the number of eaters were few, Double Horse spot opening price was small one yuan, at seven hundred and seventy-three yuan, however the wharf warrant fell five yuan, for seven hundred and forty yuan, after a short while it was heard that the gold price was not strong, foreign exchange was lengthening, selling wind rose and declined eight and nine yuan, current Double Horse price was seven hundred and sixty-four yuan, the close slightly returned up, investigated that a half day of transactions had one thousand four hundred and forty-five bales, price range twenty count Double Horse falling six yuan, Heavenly Girl falling ten yuan, Double Globe falling nine yuan, today exports had sixty-five pieces transporting to Xiamen, forty pieces transporting to Hong Kong, we will list the amounts bought by each group listed on the left.

### Various Factories Vying to Purchase, White Bale Cotton Transaction Flourishing

The cotton trade is increasingly developing, and Japanese factories are also actively purchasing. Transactions among fellow traders are even more bustling. Therefore, the foundation of cotton prices remains firm. The most common business in the market is still with Chinese cotton white bales. Japanese and Chinese also imported 1,000 bales of Tonghua cotton, priced at $164.50. Taikang imported 300 pieces of American cotton Lumite. Chinese factories Xinsheng and Rongfeng are eagerly purchasing, so the selling price continues to rise. 1,838 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived at the wharf, and 834 bales of Changyinsha cotton. The following is a list of current cotton sales:

### Grains: Japonica and Indica Rice Prices Differ by More Than Double; Middle Class Switching to Indica Rice, Sales Gradually Increasing

Since the price of Indica rice fell by 35 cents the day before yesterday, the price seems to be relatively low. Therefore, regardless of local or visiting merchants, there is a desire to purchase at a lower price. Yesterday, due to the scarcity of arrivals, only 3,120 bags of Su Kunfeng Jia rice arrived by train. People's confidence increased, and traders and brokers immediately raised prices. Therefore, the price of rice increased by 35 cents in the early market. However, recently, sales have declined, and there are still ample chips in the market. Taking advantage of this opportunity, those holding goods launched them, and the situation suddenly became weak. Prices fell back again. As a result, Japonica rice prices remained stable, without rising or falling. Special Changjing rice is still priced at $43-44, medium at $41, special Xijing rice at $42-43, medium at $41, Su Tong Kunjing rice at $41, new Jing rice at $38, Fengjing Baige rice at $40, new Yangjian rice initially called for $27, but actually opened at $26.50, followed by $15.50. Lujian also started at $26.50, followed by $25.50. Sichuanjian rice ranged from $25 to $24. Wuhu special Jian rice initially traded at $23.40, then only $23 and $22.50. Pojian rice was at $21.50 and $21. Jiangbei new Jian rice was at $22.80 to $22.50. Bianyuan rice remained unchanged at $34-35. The total market traded more than 6,000 bags.

In other news, after several days of decline, local demand has gradually increased. This is because the lowest price of Indica rice differs from the highest price of Japonica rice by more than double. It is not only welcomed by the poor but also many in the middle class are switching to Indica rice. Therefore, although there are many stocks, sales are gradually increasing. Yesterday, inquiries came from rural villages in the interior, and there were rumors that train shipments were detained by some party. The sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, and the market rebounded by 34 cents. The total market saw local households selling over 2,000 bags, and rural villages in the interior selling over 3,000 bags.

### Manufacturers Collecting Warehouse Rent, Reflow Flour Depressed

Flour: Yesterday, the current flour factory prices remained largely unchanged. The reflow flour market has been depressed because the factories are urging the withdrawal of warehouse goods. Fuxin has twice notified customers that those who do not transfer out of the warehouse after the deadline will be charged a monthly storage fee of 50 cents per bag. Therefore, warehouse receipts have been greatly affected. Those holding goods are devaluing them. The initial price opened at $6.90 to $8.50, and there was a period of chaos in the middle, reaching a price of 67 cents. As a result, actual sales in local streets and by guest merchants have also shrunk. Total market turnover is estimated at 340,000 bags. Today, flour exports are 4,440 bags to Xiamen and 11,500 bags to Hong Kong.

Wheat: Yesterday, supplies from various places were still continuous, but sales were sluggish. Factory囤 purchasing was uniformly slack. There are also reports that American wheat telegraphs have also weakened. The market has invisibly loosened by 45 points. It is estimated that the Fuxin and Fufeng factories jointly purchased over 3,000 bags of wheat from Su, Xi, Wu, and Song, and scattered stockpiles purchased one cart of Chuzhou wheat, the highest price being $9.90, followed by 5.2 cents. Today, 40 bags of wheat are being shipped to Xiamen.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Exchange Rates Increase, Foreign Sugar Prices Fall Again

Yesterday, due to the increase in foreign exchange rates, the trend of foreign sugar weakened again. The Association’s price for spot goods of No. 24 crude white sugar in local warehouses fell by $1.50 to $54, while those in foreign warehouses fell by $1 to $1.30 to $53.80 to $3.50. Transshipment sugar was at $41, down $1. Taikoo granulated white also fell slightly by $1. The East Warehouse B mark was at $57.80, the West Warehouse at $58, the CW mark at $57.50, the CX mark at $57, the DY mark at $56.50, the HX mark at $56, and the H mark crude red sugar also fell by $1.80 to $41.70. Spot Dutch red sugar was at $43, down $1.50. Local refined white sugar fell by $2, No. 1 white at $54.50, No. 2 at $54, No. 3 at $53.50, No. 4 at $53. Local crystal sugar fell by $1.50, No. 1 at $65.50, crystal bright ice at $67. It is heard that the Shenguang ship has imported domestic Xinghua sugar, but the number of arrivals is unknown.

### Coal: Hongji Dust Price Also Declines, $66 Per Ton

The price of white coal dust and other goods has also fallen recently due to excessive arrivals and sluggish sales. Yesterday, a certain company offered Hongji white coal dust to briquette factories at only $66 per ton, which is $2 less than the previous week. However, people's confidence is weak and they dare not buy speculatively, only purchasing as needed. Therefore, transactions are few. Other types of dust, such as Guba dust, are still being held and sold at $66.

### Imports and Exports: Large Quantities of Goods Shipped to South China, Foreign Goods Also Arriving

Yesterday, foreign goods arriving included 19,300 bags of white wax shipped from Holland, 300 boxes of rubber from Penang, and 540 bags of coffee beans from Singapore. As for exports, today there are 190 bags of soybeans, 98 pieces of tea, and 52 pieces of cloth shipped to Xiamen. Goods shipped to Hong Kong include 740 bags of soybeans, 1,900 tins plus 20 pieces of raw oil, 20 pieces of tea, and 200 pieces of cloth. 25 pieces of cloth are shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 11 pieces are shipped to Fangcheng, and 3 pieces are shipped to Haikou.

### Market Conditions Compilation

Silver Plummeting, American Indian Peace. A London telegram dated the 2nd states that speculators in the silver market sold off, lacking support, and the market fell. After the market closed, it stabilized. Those who quoted the listed price are watching. Spot silver fell sharply by 1.25 pence, and forward silver fell severely by 1.4375 pence. A New York silver telegram states that spot silver fell by 0.125. A Bombay silver telegram states that the Indian silver market is calm, and spot prices have slightly decreased by one anna.

Discount Rate Continues to Drop Slightly by $5: Yesterday, the discount rate for draft notes was initially quoted at $75 per thousand, then gradually decreased. By the afternoon closing, it was $70, which is slightly less than the previous day by $5. The interbank loan interest rate of the Money Trade Association was still quoted at 20 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets.

Worries about the Interruption of Woolen Imports: Both retail and wholesale woolen transactions are good. Prices on main roads are brisk, both officially and unofficially. The European War is unlikely to end in the short term. Woolen imports rely solely on Italy for shipments to Shanghai. However, the shipping company suddenly received a telegram from the factory stating that those who wish to order must settle the value of the goods in foreign currency and remit the funds in advance. The factory will not be responsible for any unexpected risks encountered during shipment, and high-priced war insurance must be guaranteed. As a result, most operators are at a loss.

Tin Plummeting Uncontrollably: The sales of spot tin, which have been weak for a long time, have been largely to the Shaoxing region. The production and sales of tin foil in that area are nationwide. Since the disruption of transportation, the tin foil market has been depressed, and the amount of Xiaohong tin has also decreased. Another sales outlet is Hong Kong. The current market conditions in Hong Kong are poor. After the outbreak of the European War, transportation has been difficult, resulting in a slump in the market. Prices have plummeted. For example, Xiaohong tin was initially quoted at $830, then fell to $650, and recently the quoted price is only around $580. Dutch tin has similarly fallen from $880 to $700. However, yesterday's market standard was only $650.

### Negotiation on Road Construction Beyond Boundaries, British Side Still Fighting Reasonably, Many Difficulties, Negotiations Stalled, Fake Police Publicly Drilling in Formation on Roads

On the evening of the 2nd, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated at a press briefing that Mr. Phillips, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the puppet Mayor Chuan Xiaonan are negotiating on the issue of taxes and road construction beyond boundaries. However, according to reports obtained yesterday, Mr. Phillips has denied this statement, saying that he is not currently continuing discussions with the puppet "Mayor." It has also been learned from reliable sources that the Shanghai Municipal Council, the British Defense Forces, the Japanese side, and the puppet "Municipal Government" recently held discussions on the issue of police power for road construction beyond boundaries. However, as of yesterday, the situation has stalled. The reason for this is still unknown. However, it is heard that the British military authorities are unwilling to concede on major points of contention and are still fighting reasonably, which is a major reason.

Road Construction Beyond Boundaries, Increasing Number of Fake Police

The area of road construction beyond boundaries, from Jing'an Temple in the east to Caojiadu in the west, and Xujiahui in the south, these triangular areas, are almost entirely controlled by fake police. In recent days, detective patrols from the police station, except for some important locations where posts are still stationed, although patrol teams patrol the roads, they no longer conduct inspections of passing pedestrians and vehicles. The number of fake police is increasing daily. Patrol teams, either by car or on foot, are constantly coming and going all day long. Their arrogance is extreme.

Two Teams of Fake Police Drilled in the Middle of the Road

The English-language Da Mei Wan Bao stated that two teams of Dadao police, each with 40 members, drilled in Yuyuan Road between Difeng Road and Yidingpan Road this afternoon (the 3rd), forcing pedestrians and vehicles to pass through in a single line. Another team of 150 Dadao police drilled in front of the Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade, and 60 were stationed at the intersection of Yidingpan Road. Each team was commanded by a Japanese military officer with a saber, but no Public Concession police were seen.

Rumors Abound, People Uneasy

In the western part of Shanghai, due to the strange actions of the Japanese and puppet forces in recent days, rumors have been rampant, and residents are panicked. The trend of relocation is at its peak. Landlords who usually rely on rent for a living are all complaining bitterly. In order to stabilize people's hearts, a certain party secretly sent people to tear off the rental notices at the entrances of alleys and on utility poles. However, yesterday, those moving eastward from Jing'an Temple were still constantly moving.

### Commemorating the Double Tenth Festival, Collecting Winter Clothing, All Groups Responding Unanimously, Resolved to Raise $200,000 in Lieu of Clothing

The National Day Commemorative Festival on October 10th is approaching in the blink of an eye. The Central Government, considering the extraordinary times, has issued an order to the whole country not to hold extravagant celebrations. In addition to raising flags to celebrate on this day, all sectors of the city will expand the winter clothing collection campaign. The details are as follows:

Raising Flags to Commemorate, No Extravagant Celebrations

All sectors of the city will not hold extravagant celebrations or any commemorative ceremonies for the National Day Commemorative Festival, in accordance with the order. However, in order to commemorate the great achievements of the revolutionary martyrs in creating China, it has been decided that all sectors of the city will raise flags for one day in accordance with the arrangements agreed upon by the various groups and the authorities of the two concessions to celebrate. On Avenue Edward VII and Fada Avenue, flag shops have been rushing to produce large quantities of national flags of various sizes in recent days to meet the needs of all sectors. It is expected that the whole city will be filled with a warm and solemn atmosphere at that time.

Expanding Collection, Winter Clothing Campaign

Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, proposed to expand the disaster relief campaign and raise funds to provide relief to disaster victims in various places during this year's Double Tenth Festival. At the same time, the National Winter Clothing Collection Campaign Committee also decided to lead local branches and charitable organizations to expand the collection of 3 million pieces of winter clothing on the Double Tenth Festival. All sectors of the city have responded unanimously to this and are currently holding separate meetings to promote the campaign. It has been decided to raise $200,000 in lieu of winter clothing to be submitted to various national banks for collection and transshipment to the front-line soldiers to provide comfort. At the same time, various industries have decided to continue to pledge donations to refugees for another year so that refugees in Shanghai can be spared the risk of freezing and starvation.

### Japanese Consul Suddenly Issued a Notice Yesterday, Announcing the Blockade of Aojiang, Implementing Military Operations Against Gu'aotou, Instructing Third-Country Ships to Sail Out of the Sea

The Japanese side announced last month that it would blockade three ports in the Wenzhou waterway. Yesterday, the Commander of the Japanese Fleet in China, Miura, issued a notice in the name of the consulate to diplomatic officials and customs officials of various countries in China, stating that it would blockade Gu'aotou in that area. The content can be divided into three points: (1) The Japanese Navy will conduct military operations against Gu'aotou, 30 nautical miles south of Wenzhou, on October 6th at 8:00 AM (Japanese time). Military warships and vessels of third countries anchored in the port are requested to sail out of the sea before that time. The Japanese military will, out of necessity for military operations, block the port with obstacles and dangerous objects after that time, so that it cannot be passed. The Japanese side will not be responsible for any losses suffered by ships and vessels that do not sail out before that time. (2) The location of the obstacles and dangerous objects is one penny north and south of passing Pipashan. (3) The vicinity of Gu'aotou will become a combat zone. It is hoped that third-country people living in that area will leave as soon as possible. It is also learned that this decision to blockade the various ports of Wenzhou announced by the Japanese side is the third decision.

Obstructing Foreign Exports, Implementing Bombing

Aojiang is in the south of Oujiang in Wenzhou, eastern Zhejiang, about 30 kilometers from Oujiang. Gu'aotou is an important port at the mouth of Aojiang. Since Aojiang was ordered to be blockaded by the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander, all ships have been anchored at Gu'aotou and have stopped sailing in. After the voyage from Wenzhou was blocked by the Japanese and suspended, foreign shipping companies changed their routes. On the morning of the 26th of last month, Gu'ao was bombed by Japanese aircraft. As a result, the British Taikoo Company's Xin Beijing ship sailed back to Shanghai to avoid danger. The purpose of the Japanese aircraft bombing was to obstruct the passage of merchant ships of various countries.

Shenyou Left Aojiang, Shenfu Sailed to

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the British Jardine Matheson Company yesterday and learned that the last foreign ship to leave Gu'aotou was the company's Shenyou ship, which left yesterday and returned to Shanghai. The company's Shenfu ship is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Fujian on the morning of the 5th.

Impossible to Invade Eastern Zhejiang

It was also learned from the shipping industry that Aojiang has long been blockaded by the Chinese military authorities, and heavy troops are stationed there, with a very solid defense. The Japanese military's announcement to invade Gu'aotou is aimed at blockading Aojiang and obstructing the passage of merchant ships of various countries. However, according to the observation of general shipping merchants, the Japanese military's announcement of invasion is purely intimidation. It is not easy to invade eastern Zhejiang from Aojiang.

### Situation in Zone A of Suzhou Creek North is Still Peaceful, Japanese Posts on North Jiangxi Road Shifted West, British Defenses Reinforced with Wire Mesh, No Need for Injections for Those Not Going to Hongkou

The wooden frame and barbed wire erected by the Japanese military on Jiangxi Road bridgehead to Bazilu area has two gaps, one at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, and one at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Wenjiansi Road, for residents of Hongkou to enter and exit. The Japanese posts were set up east of the barbed wire to check the passes of passing pedestrians. However, when the reporter went to inspect the area at 4:00 PM yesterday, he saw that the Japanese post at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Wenjiansi Road had been moved to the west side of the barbed wire to check the passes of passing pedestrians. The general residents were very alarmed by this, fearing that if they moved further west, the area that the Japanese called the new defense area (Zone A between North Henan Road and North Jiangxi Road) would be no different from being in a special zone. However, the Japanese military at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road still stood east of the barbed wire.

### Two British Warships Ordered to Withdraw Yesterday, Destination is Singapore, Other Three Are Preparing to Withdraw

In view of the urgent military needs elsewhere, the British naval authorities decided earlier to withdraw five of the ten British gunboats stationed in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River (east of Hankou). The names of the ships are Grasshopper, Dragonfly, Ladybug, Aphid, and Gold Bug. Of these five ships, only the Gold Bug is stationed in the Yangtze River. The other four ships are docked in the Huangpu River. According to reliable sources from the Dachung News Agency, after receiving the order to withdraw, the Grasshopper and Dragonfly, which were stationed in the Huangpu River, left Shanghai yesterday. The other three ships are making various preparations and will also withdraw within a few days. The destination of the withdrawal is Hong Kong and Singapore.

### North Bank of the Yangtze River, Guerrillas, Repeatedly Fight with the Japanese Army

The Zi Lin Bao reported that a Japanese army spokesperson told reporters yesterday (the 2nd) that the guerrillas near Wuxiu (transliteration) on the north bank of the Yangtze River engaged in several encounters with the Japanese army on Saturday and Sunday, but the Japanese soldiers quickly restored order. A Japanese navy spokesperson also said that the Japanese side destroyed an average of three mines in the Yangtze River every day.

### Portuguese Minister Gives a Banquet, Celebrating National Day, Will Also Give a Speech on the Commemorative Significance

This month's 5th is the Portuguese National Day. For the sake of commemoration, the Portuguese Minister to China, Li Mai, will hold a dinner celebration at the Rotary Club on Thursday (the 5th). In addition to the Minister, the Portuguese Chargé d'affaires and others will attend the grand ceremony. Minister Li Mai will give a speech on the commemorative significance.

### American Sailor, Unauthorized Firing, Arrested by the American Supervisory Office

American sailor Kaiser Tai fired his gun without permission at the New Sivo Café last month. He was arrested on Jingzhou Road on the 2nd by a warrant issued by Commissioner Kober of the American Supervisory Office. The trial was held yesterday morning.

English Army, Conscientious Defense

Since the change of defense in Zone A of Suzhou Creek North, the area west of North Henan Road has been designated as a British defense area. The Money Trade Association in that area originally had a British lookout post, which was guarded by Scottish soldiers in shifts. Yesterday afternoon, the number of British troops in the Money Trade Association suddenly increased to five or six, and the front of the lookout post was re-wrapped with barbed wire, prohibiting pedestrians from walking inside. The post is very close to the Japanese guard post on Haining Road, forming a confrontational situation.

No Need for Injections for Those Not Going to Hongkou

Since the British defense area in the concession north of Suzhou Creek and east of Henan Road was transferred to the Japanese defense area, the puppet Social Affairs Bureau had information on implementing epidemic prevention injections for residents in that defense area. Yesterday, it was learned that regarding epidemic prevention injections, new regulations have now been made: residents living in the defense area who do not enter the Hongkou area can be exempted from injections. Therefore, the statement that everyone in the defense area must be injected, which has been widely circulated by residents in the defense area in recent days, has been changed. However, if residents of the defense area need to enter Hongkou, they must still be injected. It is reported that the hospital currently responsible for this injection is Zhabei Luren Hospital, and the number of people being injected is extremely small.

No Significant Changes in the Area

Apart from the Japanese side stationing a sentry at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road and erecting boundary markers on the various roads on North Henan Road, there are no significant changes in the area. However, it is generally speculated that the Japanese side will gradually impose restrictions after the injection work is completed.

### Preventing Legal Tender from Escaping to Shanghai; Strict Review; Amounts Over 100,000 Yuan Must Be Submitted to the Ministry; No Need for a Management Committee in Shanghai

In order to prevent the outflow of legal tender from the interior and encourage the inflow of funds into the interior, the Ministry of Finance ordered the four banks, namely the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, to establish a Domestic Exchange Management Committee. The general office of the committee is located in Chongqing.  Branches of the Domestic Exchange Management Committee are established in all important cities nationwide where the four banks have joint offices. It is stipulated that remittances for the purchase of daily necessities must be approved by the committee. Applications for amounts under 100,000 yuan are reviewed and processed by the committee; those exceeding 100,000 yuan are forwarded by the committee to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Since the implementation, remittances from the interior to Shanghai have become more stringent. Without approval from the committee, remittances cannot be entrusted to banks, firms, or post offices. Particular attention is paid to remittances from the interior to Shanghai.  As Shanghai is an occupied area, and there are no restrictions on the amount of funds remitted from Shanghai to the interior, and to encourage the inflow of funds, remittances from Shanghai to the interior are particularly welcome.  Therefore, under the current circumstances, there is no need to establish an exchange management committee in Shanghai.  Shanghai banks are allowed to waive remittance fees for remittances to the interior and may pay in Shanghai's common exchange, with the aim of promoting the movement of floating capital into the interior.

### Yanagawa Visits Wang Jingwei

The English-language "Evening Standard" reports that Lieutenant General Yanagawa, Director-General of the Asia Development Board of Japan, accompanied by several Japanese officers and escorted by detectives from the Public Concession Police Department and Japanese soldiers, went to Wang Jingwei's residence on Yuyuan Road this morning (the 3rd) for a meal.

### French Residents in Shanghai Donate to Purchase Ambulances; Under the Auspices of the French Ambassador's Wife; Efforts to Raise Funds to Present to the Motherland

Many prominent French residents in Shanghai, under the auspices of Mrs. Cosme, wife of the French Ambassador, have recently established an "Ambulance Donation Committee" modeled after the original methods of France and other countries. The committee prepares to solicit donations from French residents and French friends throughout the city in order to purchase an ambulance, to be named "Shanghai Ambulance," to be presented to the French government. The total cost is 250,000 French francs. It is expected that French residents and French friends will donate enthusiastically, and it will not be difficult to accomplish this charitable act in the shortest possible time. The receiving office is Banque de l'Indochine, please contact Mr. Beseval, the auditor.

### Government Bonds Issued After the War of Resistance; Creditworthiness Remains Reliable; In Addition to Public Subscription, Banks Underwrite; Most of it Has Not Yet Been Used, and the Market Trusts it Greatly

The Ministry of Finance maintains its creditworthiness and never changes. The principal and interest due are allocated to the Central Bank of China on schedule and deposited into the National Debt Fund Management Committee account for repayment of principal and interest. The consolidated rehabilitation gold and long three debts guaranteed by customs duties are also discounted by the four banks, namely the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, and paid as usual. Therefore, the Shanghai stock grey market has always been stable. Government bonds issued and managed by the Central Government after the War of Resistance include: (1) The 26th Year of the Republic of China National Salvation Bonds for 500 million yuan; (2) The 27th Year of the Republic of China National Defense Bonds for 500 million yuan; (3) The 27th Year of the Republic of China Gold Bonds for 100 million yuan in Customs Gold Units, 10 million pounds sterling, and 50 million US dollars; (4) The 28th Year of the Republic of China Construction Bonds for 600 million yuan; (5) The 28th Year of the Republic of China Military Supply Bonds for 600 million yuan; (6) The Relief Bonds for 30 million yuan. The total issuance is 2.23 billion yuan in national currency, 100 million Customs Gold Units, 50 million US dollars, and 50 million pounds sterling. Except for the National Salvation Bonds, which are subscribed to by the people, the US dollar, pound sterling, and Customs Gold Unit bonds are solicited from overseas Chinese. The National Defense, Relief, Military Supply, and Construction Bonds are underwritten by various banks. Moreover, since the War of Resistance, very little has been used, and most of it has been properly stored. Therefore, there is absolutely no need to worry about war expenses in the future.

### High Cost of Living; Two Factories Strike in Succession; The Bada Silk Factory Has Been Deadlocked for Half a Month Without Resolution; Workers at the Qingong Silk Factory Have Put Forward Conditions

Bada Silk Factory

About 200 workers from the first, second, and third factories of the Bada Silk Factory on North Henan Road in this city are known for their high-quality silk products that sell well in various ports in Southeast Asia, forming a unique prosperous situation among the withered silk factories after the war. Recently, it was heard that the method of equal warp and weft has aroused the dissatisfaction of the workers. All the workers are feeling the increase in the cost of living in Shanghai, but the capitalists are using it as an excuse to deduct wages, making it difficult to maintain a living, resulting in a joint strike by the workers of the three factories, who put forward the following conditions to the capitalists: (1) During the period of equal warp and weft, the capitalists shall provide each person with 5 jiao of living expenses per day; (2) During the period of stoppage of work for pattern modification, the capitalists shall subsidize food expenses; (3) Maintain the 11:30 working hours. The labor dispute has been deadlocked for half a month, and the capitalists have not yet come forward to negotiate. Yesterday, a certain officer from the police station came forward to mediate, but the capitalists did not appoint official representatives.

Qingong Silk Factory

All 270 workers of the Qingong Silk Factory on Xiaoshadu Road, due to the high cost of living, were forced to request the factory authorities to guarantee their livelihood and provide relief measures. It is learned that the conditions put forward by the workers are as follows: (1) Restore the 11:30 working hours. If it cannot be restored, then subsidize 3 jiao of living expenses per day; (2) The factory shall plan for food and accommodation; (3) Those who cannot maintain their work and life shall be given 30 yuan by the factory as travel expenses to return to their hometown. Since yesterday, the capitalists have not made any expression, resulting in a general strike.

### Japanese Army Floats Sunken Ships; Tows Them to Shanghai for Demolition

The "North China Daily News" reports that the Chinese army previously used 75 to 100 ships of various types, fully loaded with cement, and sank them in the Yangtze River near Jiangyin to form a water barrier to prevent the Japanese navy from invading. Among them was an old river steamer. Recently, the Japanese navy floated it from the bottom of the river and towed it to Shanghai with a tugboat. Yesterday (the 2nd), it was moored near Zhoujiazui. Soon, it will be towed to the Jiangnan Shipyard for demolition and melting, it is said to manufacture munitions or steel plates. It is heard that the ship is one of the old ships of the Sanbei Company. The ship's hull shows signs of having been burned and is mottled with rust and covered with mud.

### Attempting to Control Tianjin-Tanggu Freight; Instigating a Barge Strike; Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Tanggu Barge Transportation Stopped; Shanghai Tianjin Merchants Dare Not Ship Goods

Since the great flood in Tianjin, there has been an extreme shortage of food. In the past month, a large amount of flour and miscellaneous grains have been transported from this city to provide relief. Most of these goods are carried by Japanese ships, and the rest are shipped by the ships of Jardine Matheson & Co. and Butterfield & Swire. However, the warehouses of Butterfield & Swire in Tanggu are narrow and must be barged to Tianjin, which is more troublesome. Therefore, most merchants load onto Jardine Matheson & Co. However, Butterfield & Swire has more barges between Tianjin and Tanggu, and barge transportation is slightly more convenient. After the Yantai barge strike last month, it was instigated by a certain party and then mediated by a certain party. Although it has been resolved, the barge transportation industry has already been managed by it. Now, it is heard that the barges of Butterfield & Swire in Tanggu have also been instigated by a certain party to strike, demanding increased wages. It has been going on for many days and has not yet been resolved. Therefore, the Haikou ship of the company going to Tianjin today, except for 10% of the goods originally shipped from Hong Kong, the Tianjin merchants in this street dare not load their goods, and the ship sails to Tianjin empty, fearing that the barge transportation industry there will also suffer the same fate as Yantai in the future and be controlled by it.

Tianjin Flood Recedes; Outward Shipping Resumes

Since late August, Tianjin suddenly experienced a flash flood, with the Hai River estuary and both banks flooded. Navigation was indistinguishable, and targets were lost. The water at the Zizhu Forest Wharf in the British Concession reached over ten feet, making it difficult for ships to navigate and impossible to dock and unload. All ships operating on the line, such as Xin'an Na, Xin'an Fu, Xin'an Sui, Taishun, and Xinxiang Tai, were temporarily suspended. Northern Ocean liners such as Shengjing, Shuntian, Dingsheng, Yunnan, and Fusheng were also suspended from Tianjin and only operated to Yantai, Qingdao, and Weihaiwei. According to the Daguan News Agency reporter's inquiry to the shipping industry, the flood in Tianjin has gradually receded since the 20th of last month and has now completely receded. Therefore, most ships have resumed shipping one after another. The British merchant Liji ship (managed by Qiacheng Company), Butterfield & Swire's Xin Beijing ship, and Moller & Co.'s Kaisiten Moller ship sailed to Tianjin on the 2nd. Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Dingsheng ship and Butterfield & Swire's Shuntian ship both sailed to Tianjin yesterday. The ship setting sail today is Butterfield & Swire's Haikou ship.

Baihe River Silting; Passengers and Goods are Transferred

According to a Daguan News Agency reporter's inquiry, although the outer ships on the Shanghai-Tianjin line have resumed shipping, the Baihe River has not been dredged and is silted up, and the waterway is extremely shallow, only reaching about ten feet. Therefore, larger ships are still unable to sail to Tianjin. The ships of Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson & Co. are equipped with barges, and passengers and goods are transferred at the Tanggu estuary. Other ships go directly to the Zizhu Forest Wharf. All ships, except for Xin'an Na, which has joined the Ningbo route, such as Xin'an Fu and Ansui Taishun, have not yet resumed shipping because the waterway is silted up and they cannot enter the port. The British merchant Xinxiang Tai ship originally intended to sail to Tianjin after the trial voyage to Aojiang was blocked and returned, but it has not been successful. It is now scheduled to sail to Ningbo tomorrow.

### Renji Hospital Women's Society Holds Regular Meetings

### New Rules Implemented in the Rice Market; Sufficient Arrivals for Sales; 4,000 to 5,000 Bags Arrive Daily; Rice Prices Will Fall

The entire food problem in Shanghai has been around for several months. The selling prices of various goods have been handled by organizations managing tribute rice at leveled prices, and the concession authorities have also repeatedly decided to find ways to suppress rice prices, in order to reduce the burden on citizens. It is heard that rice-producing areas such as Wuhu, Changshu, Wuxi, Changzhou, Danyang, Suzhou, Kunshan, etc., have all reported a bumper harvest of late rice and have already entered the market. Rice merchants from various gangs have been dredged, but the so-called "transportation certificate" has not yet been settled. Once the negotiation is completed, a large amount of domestic rice can be transported to Shanghai for sale. Currently, the domestic rice transported to Shanghai is from various cities and counties along the Sujia Railway and various places in Nangang. 4,000 to 5,000 bags arrive daily, which is enough for daily sales. Therefore, rice prices will fall.

Rice Trade Association

The temporary market trading rules of the tea market have been revised and passed by the joint meeting of representatives of the seven rice trade associations on the 2nd of this month. In addition to attending the joint meeting and contributing opinions, the members of the market management committee also separately convened representatives of the market, customer, and shop parties yesterday morning to report on the revision of the "Market Trading Rules" by the rice trade association joint meeting and advised that future transactions must be conducted in accordance with these rules, and that both buyers and sellers must conduct spot transactions. Empty sales and empty purchases are not allowed, in order to adjust the people's food.

May Not Go Off Track

Transactions. All intermediary operations, sales of consignment goods, or purchases of rice by rice shops must be traded in the market. The representatives all expressed their agreement to these rules. Therefore, future operations in the market will gradually become standardized, and all dark transactions will be reduced. The members of the market mediation committee are organized by an equal number of people from the market, customer, and shop parties to handle market disputes. The market management committee will hold regular meetings to discuss and propose.

### Requesting Instructions on Remittance for Domestic Goods Shipped to Shanghai; Seems to Increase Public Hardship; Intends to Request Exemption

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday regarding the remittance of domestic goods shipped to Shanghai, stating: "To the honorable Ministers of Military Celebration, Finance, and Economic Affairs, we recently saw in the newspaper that all goods shipped from Zhejiang Customs to Shanghai for domestic sales, regardless of type, must be remitted. The high price of goods in Shanghai has broken historical records. In this situation, it is tantamount to pricing domestic goods as foreign goods, which hinders commercial sales and increases public hardship. We should request that your ministries provide instructions on the reasons for this remittance decision, so that all industries can jointly appeal for exemption. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."

### Portuguese Woman; Valuable Luggage Confiscated; Valued at Over Ten Thousand Yuan for Jewelry and Leather Goods; Intercepted on a Japanese Ship to Hong Kong Yesterday Morning

The English-language Dama Evening News reported that Mrs. Almeida, a Portuguese national, boarded the Japanese ship Asama Maru this morning (the 3rd) intending to go to Hong Kong to meet her husband. Suddenly, customs inspectors blocked the ship, stopping it for 15 minutes, and inspected Mrs. Almeida's belongings, and confiscated her jewelry and leather goods worth approximately 50,000 yuan and 50 sets of leather clothing, also worth 50,000 yuan. This unprecedented incident occurred within minutes of the Asama Maru leaving the Huishan Wharf. At that time, customs inspectors boarded the ship and asked the captain to stop for a moment, then entered Mrs. Almeida's cabin, saying that they wanted to inspect her luggage. It is said that the inspectors acted rudely and eventually carried out Mrs. Almeida's luggage, saying that it was not "stated that there was such luggage." The luggage was then taken to the Customs Office at Huishan Wharf. Mrs. Almeida followed, and the inspectors issued a temporary receipt stating the number of pieces of luggage, but did not list the contents of each piece of luggage one by one. Mrs. Almeida has notified the Portuguese Consulate, but it is believed that Mrs. Almeida's stay in Shanghai has not been less than three months, and the Portuguese authorities have asked her to report the matter to the Jianghai Customs Tax Department.

### Manager of Foreign Goods Store; Embezzles Accounts; Sentenced to Eight Months in Prison

Qiu Zibin (29 years old), a Ningbo native who was the manager of Nanxinghua Foreign Miscellaneous Goods Store, No. 4, Lane 510, Beigaoshou Lane, Er'erjin Road, was recently whimsical and often gambled in Caogadu Rongsheng Company, losing hundreds of gold but still unwilling to give up. Therefore, between September 23 and 29, he privately carved three seals, Nanxing and Hakka Fuyuan, and secretly wrote collection receipts, privately collecting goods worth 1,756 yuan from Hakka Huaping, Dadong, Yichang, and other Nanjing gangs, and then went to the gambling table to make a desperate bet and lost everything. He asked for leave for a few days, hiding in room 60 of the Jiangsu Hotel, No. 50, Lane 370, Fuzhou Road, still planning to find a way to borrow money to make a comeback at the gambling den. The case was discovered when Sun Wuxiang, the Ningbo owner of Nanxing Store, found out and reported it to the Huishi Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detective Shen Dehui and Chinese detective No. 82 to rush to the hotel to arrest him, along with the three forged seals, and took them to the police station. He was escorted to the First Special District Court yesterday morning, and Judge Jiang Shuzi interrogated him and sentenced Qiu Zibin to eight months in prison as a warning, and the forged seals were confiscated.

### Abduction and Ransom of a Girl Leads to Arrest

Hang Dangpei (age 46), a Wuxi native residing at No. 4 Baoye Lane, Gordon Road, at 3:30 PM on September 28th, secretly went to the home of his fellow townsman Wu Nanshan at No. 310, Lane 1001, Xiaoshadu Road. Taking advantage of an opportunity, he lured Wu's seven-year-old daughter, Zhenxian, away. He housed her at the residence of a woman named Liu Yu at No. 2, Lane 66, Huangpu Beach Road in the French Concession, intending to sell her to other provinces for profit. To observe Wu Nanshan's reaction, he went to Wu's house the next morning to inquire about news. Wu, indeed, did not suspect that his daughter Zhenxian had been abducted by him. Wu told Hang the situation and gave him one French dollar to help find her. On the morning of the 20th, at 8:00 AM, Hang met Wu Nanshan at the Dongxing Teahouse on Gordon Road and said, "Your daughter Zhenxian has been found, and can be located within three days. However, you must offer a reward of several tens of dollars to achieve this." Upon hearing this, Wu Nanshan realized that his daughter Zhenxian had been lured away by Hang, hidden somewhere, with the intention of extorting money for her return. He immediately turned Hang over to the patrolling police, who took him to the Putuo Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, explained the case, stating that Wu's daughter Zhenxian had already been sent back to her home by Liu Yu. He requested a postponement of the investigation to find accomplices. Following this, Wu Nanshan and his daughter Zhenxian provided a written testimony. When questioned, the defendant's answers were evasive. Judge Huang Risheng ruled for continued detention and rescheduled the hearing.

### Kuang Baowei Assaults Mistress, Court Orders Bail Pending Trial

Kuang Baowei, son of Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of the Penglai Market and Penglai Bank in the Nanshi area, is 27 years old and a native of Wuxi. He resides at No. 9, Lane 698, Pushi Road in the French Concession. He is a graduate of the China Wireless Electric School. Seven years ago, Kuang met a Hankou woman named Cheng Meifang (now 20 years old). Kuang coveted Cheng's beauty and made every effort to seduce her. When Meifang was 13 years old, Kuang engaged in a relationship with her and built a "golden house" for her at No. 36, Meiren Lane, Sanma Road. Shortly after, they had two sons. The eldest son unfortunately died young, and the surviving son is named Yuanyuan, now four years old. Subsequently, Kuang abruptly changed his behavior, took his son Yuanyuan home to raise, and separated from Cheng. On the first of this month, Cheng, accompanied by her mother Xu, went to Kuang's home to visit the child. A verbal argument ensued, and both mother and daughter were severely beaten by Kuang. After reporting the incident to the police, Kuang Baowei was arrested at 11:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 2nd) and detained at the police station. Yesterday, he was transferred to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer stated that Cheng Meifang was seriously injured and requested an extension. Judge Zhu reviewed the case and scheduled the next hearing for the 13th. The defendant was released on bail.

Lu Jingen, a 41-year-old native of Pudong residing at No. 8, Jiru Lane, Jixiang Street, has been working as a transportation foreman at the Xinfeng, Gengfeng, and Qianfeng grain and clothing shops. He has a 14-year-old adopted daughter named Lin Bao, whom he has raised since childhood. Recently, Lu's wife, Sheng, has been severely beating and abusing her. The day before yesterday, the father severely punished the girl, causing injuries all over her body. Neighbors, feeling indignant, reported the matter to the police. Detective Zhong Benchang was dispatched to investigate. Lu's wife, Sheng, had already fled upon hearing the news. Lu was arrested and, along with the girl, taken to the police station. After verifying that the girl's injuries were real, Lu Jingen was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court yesterday for prosecution. According to the girl Lin Bao's testimony, she was abused. When questioned, Lu claimed that he manages transportation outside every day and that his wife manages household affairs. He denied the abuse. He hired lawyer Xu Lin to defend him. Judge Zhu Chuzhe reviewed the testimony and ordered a retrial on the 13th. The defendant was detained, and the victim was sent to the forensic medical office for examination and verification of the injuries.

### Scrap Metal Collection in Zhabei

Since Zhabei suffered devastation from the recent military conflict, all remaining bricks, tiles, charred wood have been almost entirely sold off. Copper and iron are collected by over a thousand laborers daily, loaded onto trucks, and piled up in vacant lots in Yangshupu, to be transported to Japan. The amount is no less than tens of millions of tons. Consequently, the amount of copper and iron in Zhabei is decreasing daily. However, 500 to 600 laborers are still collecting various scrap iron pipes, iron bars, and iron sheets everywhere. Even the smallest nail is not left behind. They are also digging up underground water pipes everywhere, working diligently. If residents are found secretly carrying copper or iron into the concessions, their lives are in danger.

### Wife Abandons Husband, Husband Betrays Wife: Adulterous Couple Attempts Suicide, Woman Dies, Man Critically Ill

Yang Meiyu, a 24-year-old Ningbo woman residing at No. 6 Hongyun Lane, Huage Nie Road in the French Concession, married just three or four months ago. Influenced by vanity, she disliked her husband's appearance and engaged in an affair with Yu Weishan (31 years old), a fellow townsman and husband of a woman living at No. 129 Fujian Road in the Central Concession. However, Yu recently lost his job and was unemployed, causing

economic hardship, making it difficult to maintain a happy life. Their good times did not last long. Both developed suicidal thoughts. On the afternoon of the 30th of last month, the woman left home and sent a letter to her mother and elder brother, telling them that she was going to commit suicide because she found life uninteresting. Yu also left his wife, Shao (28 years old), without her knowledge. After meeting with Yang, they purchased two bottles of poisonous liquid and at 10:00 PM that night, they went together to the Xinxin Hotel at No. 114 Zhengjia Wood Bridge in the French Concession, under the pretext of renting room 215. They each

swallowed a bottle of the poison. Afterwards, they discarded the empty bottles in the toilet and lay on the bed, head to head, awaiting death. The next morning, the tea boy discovered them, both barely alive and on the verge of death. He immediately reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. Unable to determine the cause of death, they sent them to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, a female servant at the hotel emptied the toilet and discovered the poison bottles. Only then did they realize that they had

attempted suicide by poison. However, Yang Meiyu was severely poisoned and died at 5:00 PM on the 2nd, despite treatment. The police sent the body to the coroner's office for examination. Yesterday, the Second Special District Court was requested to send a prosecutor to the scene to confirm the cause of death. The body was claimed by her brother, Yang Renhao, after signing a statement. Yu Weishan is still being treated in the hospital. Whether his life can be saved is uncertain.

### US Consul's Chauffeur Kidnapped on Hongqiao Road

Last Friday, Gao Qi, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, was driven by his local chauffeur, Zhang Zhixiang (48 years old), to the Chengjiaqiao Ball Game Association on Hongqiao Road in the Western District of Shanghai. Mr. Gao alighted the car and went inside, while Zhang Zhixiang sat alone in the car. Less than half an hour later, six or seven kidnappers arrived, each armed with a Mauser pistol. They forcibly dragged Zhang Zhixiang out of the car and abducted him. His whereabouts remain unknown.

### Substituting Inferior Milk, Deliveryman Accused of Fraud

The "Kedi" Milk Company at No. 1567 Avenue Joffre, is renowned for its superior products. Unexpectedly, customers recently discovered inferior milk being passed off as "Kedi". They immediately reported it to the police, who dispatched investigators. It was discovered the day before yesterday that Mao Qugui (24 years old, local), the company's milk deliveryman on route number 14, was filling the returned empty bottles with inferior milk every day and delivering it to customers, while delivering the good milk to his own subscribers, using a scheme to profit. The police arrested Mao the day before yesterday and took him to the police station for investigation. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. After the police presented the case, they requested an extension. Judge Zhang reviewed the case and ordered a retrial on a later date. The two defendants were detained.

### Two Russians Arrested for Attempted Theft

A Russian, Li Ang Fookes Chiglin Wald, and an accomplice loitered in front of various money changers on Sichuan Road, intending to commit pickpocketing.

After a brief interrogation by Judge Zhong, he ordered them to be detained for a retrial at a later date.

### Registration of Lawyers in French Concession Halted

According to the China News Agency, the authorities in the French Concession of this city had previously planned to hold a registration for lawyers in this city. All lawyers appearing in the Second Special District Court were required to first apply for registration with the authorities and obtain a certificate before they could practice. Since the announcement of this measure, the legal community has generally considered the measure inappropriate and requested the Shanghai Bar Association to submit a report to the Ministry of Judicial Administration of the Central Government for instructions. No decision has been made to date. It is now heard that the French Concession authorities have recently reviewed the aforementioned lawyer registration measure and believe that under the current circumstances, it is not entirely necessary. Therefore, it has now been effectively halted.

Autumn and Spring Life Reports

### First Day at Work: At a Small Wooden Toy Factory

With a strange excitement, she resolutely and reluctantly left her not-yet-awake home. The morning air still carried a misty chill. It was the first time she had walked on the road so early by herself, and it was a novel interest for her. There were very few people on the road, it was still very early. She knew, but did not slow down. She thought: The first day should always be early, and if she arrived alone first, it would be more natural to greet the others as they arrived one by one, than to arrive late and greet groups of people. So, unconsciously, she walked even faster.

At the entrance of the alley, a pungent smell of acetone stabbed into her nostrils. She quickly covered her nose with a handkerchief. Hesitantly, she walked into the lane. The tall, rigid door was solemnly closed. She reached out and knocked on the door knocker a few times, but there was no sound inside. After a pause, she discovered that the door was not tightly closed, leaving a crack. She gently pushed it open and walked in.

Walking into the factory, a faint smell of acetone greeted her. Several rough wooden tables were arranged horizontally and vertically, and the machines were all silent. The floor, swept by a broom, still had faint traces of sawdust. She sat down in her place.

Lazy footsteps echoed on the stairs. She guessed that it might be the foreman or the manager, who should have gotten up early to inspect the machines... But what first appeared in the doorway was a broom and dustpan, followed by a slovenly, listless boy. Confused, she greeted him. The boy was also startled, and silently carried the dustpan and broom inside.

The workers arrived in twos and threes, and the factory quickly became lively. When the clock struck seven, the motor started, and the male workers all stood by the machines. She put on her newly made apron, feeling a strand of inexplicable joy.

The sawing machine raised bursts of sawdust like dust, mixed with a thick smell of acetone, forming a turbid atmosphere. Several male workers were wearing masks, but most were not. None of the female workers were. The strong smell of acetone made her throat dry and her hair and body were covered in sawdust. Looking at the others, they seemed as if nothing was happening, their laughter competing with the sound of the machines. She tried her best to endure: "You won't be afraid once you get used to it."

"Why don't you all wear masks too?" She felt that there wasn't a healthy person in this group, although their spirits were quite lively.

"Not used to wearing them! It feels stuffy and uncomfortable in our noses!" The female worker next to her, who was chatting enthusiastically with others, answered her. Her eyebrows were also covered in wood powder.

In the polishing section behind, twenty or so pairs of hands held sandpaper, rubbing the edges of rough wooden pieces, spreading a roomful of air harmful to the human body. However, the workers, as if their senses were numb, just lowered their heads and did their work. She couldn't help but feel both pity and admiration. She wanted to say: Health is also important!

"What time do you work until at night?" After a while, she asked again.

"Nine thirty."

"That's so late!"

"The male workers don't get off until ten thirty."

"Is the pay better?"

"Not necessarily. Their salary is lower than ours. They're not called workers, they're just considered apprentices, so their work is harder than most, and their salary is discounted!"

"Ah! —"

She couldn't help but feel deeply sorry for them, and a wave of pity swept over her.

Lunchtime was an hour. Except for a few who went home, the rest ate their lunch and then went to the sawing section to chat with the male workers. Only she stayed in the priming area, quietly eating her bread. Taking advantage of the space, she went to see the glazing, drilling, and nailing departments... Everywhere was quiet, and the rising dust seemed intermittent.

She picked up a nearly finished movable elephant. Its trunk swung back and forth. She stretched out her finger and gently tapped it:

"Who knows how much energy and health has been consumed for such a small toy!" (Su Mo)

### 200,000 Yuan for Winter Clothing

— Zhang Zhenshan

The cycle of seasons has brought us to late autumn once more. The piercing cold air has already begun to assault the earth, and its power intensifies with time. We are fortunate to be able to hide in our houses, already shivering from the cold. But the soldiers who fight for us, for the free survival of our children and grandchildren, battling in the fields, leaping through the mountains, surging through the rivers—the threat of that cold air is a thousand times more severe for them than it is for us. As this harsh winter approaches, how can we remain indifferent as we tailor our own winter clothes? I believe everyone is willing to donate voluntarily, isn't that right?

This year, the National Winter Clothing Collection Committee has stipulated that each special region must raise money for winter clothing, and Shanghai is only responsible for 200,000 yuan. Assuming there are four million people in the greater Shanghai area, then each person's contribution to the soldiers' winter needs is only five cents! In reality, it doesn't take any effort at all. Although there are many poor people, perhaps poor people will donate money for winter clothing more readily than the wealthy. Therefore, we hope to start a competition to donate money for winter clothing, expanding the amount as much as possible. The more, the better.

Winter clothing, while serving to keep out the cold, also represents a close connection and sincere encouragement between the military and the people. Particularly for those of us in special regions, it expresses our fervent hopes and concerns. At the same time, the soldiers will surely be more moved, encouraged, and motivated by the winter clothing presented by the special regions than by that presented by the people in the rear.

From our perspective, those of us living in Shanghai are like being in a train that has come uncoupled, losing the power to move forward, suffering unspeakable pain in our lives. To take the most obvious example, the control and manipulation of daily necessities, the difficulty of transportation, has led to soaring prices, making it difficult to sustain life. Wives are cold and children are hungry. What are the factors behind this? This is an example of "the nation comes before the family." Therefore, we cannot simply lament the high cost of living, or crane our necks and wait for prices to fall. We must use our strength to remove the pressure that is being placed on us. In the past, there were some people who lacked awareness, acting as if it was none of their business, believing that they could stay out of it in the concessions, enjoying themselves, acting recklessly, and not striving for progress. Now, there is the fact of correction for this error in realization. As President Chiang has said: "There is no distinction between north and south, no distinction between old and young... Resistance is the responsibility of every Chinese person... Everyone must do what they can, contributing money if they have money, contributing strength if they have strength."

Shanghai's contribution of 200,000 yuan for winter clothing is only a little better than being unable to do anything at all. Strictly speaking, it doesn't count as "contributing money if you have money, contributing strength if you have strength." People of Shanghai, be enthusiastic! The future rewards will be ten thousand times higher than the cost of winter clothing!

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Sixteen: Planning to Establish a Medical School and Creating Talented Scholars; Thinking About Expanding Village Governance and Establishing Daycare

After they had decided on the day to go to Shanghai, on Saturday afternoon, Wu Junsu waited for them in the dormitory, specially for their arrival. This time, there were indeed many people attending Jin Danyu's wedding banquet, because her social circle was wide, and she treated people kindly on weekdays. Even Lin Jiancheng didn't have as many people on his side as she did. Some people said: This time, the wedding gifts they received from people must be considerable. In reality, there weren't many, because this trend has changed greatly after the war compared to before the war. Before the war, for all social weddings, funerals, and celebrations, gifts were given: the gifts given were often impractical. For example, when people had happy events, they would often send a large red silk banner, with four golden characters, which was truly useless. Many families, because they knew two wealthy people, would hang up the banners given by the wealthy people, thinking that they had dealings with wealthy people. There were even cases where wealthy people had not sent banners, and people forged the wealthy people's signatures. After the war, these vanities and pretenses were broken. Moreover, those banners were originally made of flannel or satin, which could be repurposed to make clothes or quilt covers. Later, they became the worst kind of rayon, which had no other use besides making banners. And what about sending silver shields and silverware? They were all copper plates, coated with some silver. Inlaid with redwood bases and fitted with glass frames, they seemed somewhat artistic, but were actually vulgar and unsightly. These things were even more useless, because banners, with a changed signature, could be transferred to other people; those silver shields and the like, engraved with your name, as well as their own name, could not be transferred to other people. Keeping them was useless, discarding them was a pity, and piling them up took up space in the house. Those things, when made, were worth seven or eight dollars, but if you sold them to a junk collector, he wouldn't even want them for two or three jiao. At that time, the most straightforward gifts were naturally cash. But many people often couldn't even provide for themselves, but for the sake of face, they insisted on giving gifts. There were even some official circles where, whether it was an old lady's birthday or a young master's wedding or a young lady's wedding, gifts were openly collected. Subordinates would openly collect shares to flatter their superiors. Among the gifts, there were also distinctions of class and rank, with levels such as fortune, prosperity, longevity, and joy. No matter if you were short of food and unable to cover your roof, these gifts to your superiors could not be skipped. This trend was not only in official circles, but also in some institutions, and even in the business world. It seemed as if you would lose face if you didn't give a gift. This was clearly open bribery, and the extent of the corruption was terrifying! (187)

### Attempt to Quit Smoking

— Jia

Has every smoker made a vow to quit this habit more than once? I think so. But who can match their words with their actions, even for a relatively long period? In fact, every smoker knows that cigarettes are not as difficult to quit as other poisons, and no one will admit that smoking cigarettes is addictive. This can be proven by the fact that everyone has had more than one period of quitting. Yet, no one can sustain the fight. Among friends, we often hear vows to quit smoking. Some even make contracts, signing strict penalty clauses. The result is only a few days of forced abstinence. After one person breaks the contract, it is implicitly cancelled, leaving behind a permanent joke. I also had a friend who was hospitalized due to illness, and was therefore forced to quit cigarettes. He was proud of this, believing that this time he had achieved his goal of quitting. But less than a month after being discharged from the hospital, he resumed the habit, starting with "a cigarette after a meal." He even had his excuses, saying: This is due to the environment. In the hospital, doctors do not allow smoking, and there are no smokers in the same ward, so everyone did not smoke. But now, for social gatherings with friends or business dealings, cigarettes are the most common form of socializing, so one has to indulge a little. There is naturally some truth to this, the so-called "social cigarette."

Therefore, I have never advised people to quit smoking, nor have I vowed to quit myself. I only try to "smoke less" within the realm of possibility, that is, only socialize with "social cigarettes" when socializing is absolutely necessary. Now, I am trying "to quit smoking" for the first time. "Trying" naturally does not mean firmly quitting, but since success has always been in trying, if one's will is strong, this "trying" may be the initial success of "abstaining."

The so-called "trying to quit smoking" comes with the following conditions. First: "smoke less," for example, buy boxed cigarettes instead of canned ones as before. This way, you can check how many cigarettes you have smoked today at any time, and unconsciously reduce the opportunity to smoke. Second: People generally say that smoking is to relieve boredom, so in their spare time, buy some sweets, peanuts, etc. to replace cigarettes, to achieve the purpose of "smoking less."

Now the price of cigarettes has soared. Ordinary cigarettes that used to cost ten cents a box have risen to about twenty cents. The monthly consumption in this area has doubled. In these times of high prices, from the perspective of thrift, we should also reduce this unnecessary consumption. Let's try it out and test whether our will is strong or not?

### Review of New Performers at Geng Xin Theatre

— Su Shaoqing

The Geng Xin Stage hired new performers who began performing on the evening of the 27th. During the day, an opening ceremony was held, with the four female dan performers Wu (Suqiu), Zhao (Jinrong), Liang (Yunqiu), and Li (Wanyun) cutting the ribbon. I personally attended the event. In the evening, the four female dan performers' joint performance of "Four Five Flower Caves" was something I didn't want to watch. The play "Five Flower Caves" is a double act of truth and falsehood, which is illogical. Moreover, doubling it again to make it four is even more ridiculous. I am already afraid of listening to the records of the four female dan performers and watching the movies of the four Pan Jinlians, let alone the four young female dan performers. On the third day, Wu Suqiu performed two plays, ("Baolian Deng," "Zhan Wancheng"). It is worth seeing both the Qingyi and Huadan roles. In addition, there are old male performers Chen Shaolin, old female performers Li Duokui, and painted-face performer Li Chunheng to watch, so I went. By the time I arrived, the "Jian Jiu Ling" had already been sung. In this play, the young male performer plays Zhu Xuhou Liu Zhang, singing the Erhuang Manban, which is extremely difficult to master. In the past, De Junru was skilled at it. I have never seen Zhou Weijun perform it, and I don't know how he sings it.

Li Duokui sang the Empress Dowager's farewell to the court. Duokui's voice is quite loud and clear, but the pronunciation is slightly lacking in clarity. In the Xipi Shouban of the Changting farewell scene, she sang loudly and vigorously, which is the skill of singing opera. Old and talented people are rare, so we have to let Duokui walk alone, and there is no need to compare her with Xie Baoyun and Gong Yunfu.

"Baolian Deng" has a scene of "making a scene in school." Chen Shaolin plays Liu Yanchang, and his singing is very disciplined, without any deviations from the tune. He can be called a sober person among a drunken crowd, which I admire the most. His voice is authentic and without any evilness. Although the sound is not loud, it can still be released. If he cultivates his energy and works hard, he can become very popular. His acting is vivid and has excellent points, such as when he says to his wife, "Speak after waking up... I will kneel." He deliberately pretends to be nonchalant to deceive his wife into swearing an oath. This part is the most appropriate. Among the few lines of dialogue, some words are low in voice and not clear. It is advisable to pay attention to correcting them.

Wu Suqiu plays Wang Guiying, using the new school to sing the Shouban. Her appearance is beautiful, and she is full of intelligence. Her movements are smooth. Singing new tunes is not annoying, and her pronunciation is generally accurate. However, the "Hua Fa Zhe" sounds like Shang Xiaoyun, dull and muffled, which must be changed. For example, the pronunciation of the word "da" is close to the ancient sound, starting with the sound of "duo," which is not suitable for female dan performers. Her acting and expression are very refined, mostly derived from intelligence. (If she were to act in shadow plays, she could overwhelm everything. It is a pity that this kind of talent is not found in movies.) A friend next to me said: "Suqiu sings well but her costume is not good." I smiled and said: "With such a beautiful face and crescent eyebrows, are you worried that no one will give her new costumes?"

In "Zhan Wancheng," Zhang Ji is played by Liang Huichao. Liang is young and his skills are fiery, which belongs to the southern school. Li Chunheng plays Cao Cao, imitating Hao Shoushen, adding double the humor to the old and spicy performance. It is a pity that his voice is not as good as before. Wu Suqiu plays Zou Shi, deeply understanding the plot, and fully performs it. Watching the two rats fighting and spying on Cao Man from the upstairs playing the qin, her posture is elegant, obtaining the secrets of Gou Huisheng. A woman with this kind of charm, coupled with a face that seems to be smiling but not smiling, who wouldn't want to watch her? Why wouldn't she be popular? Wu's Huadan plays are better than her Qingyi plays, because she is as gorgeous as peaches and plums, suitable for passion but not for coldness. Because it was already half-past eleven, I didn't watch "Ci Shen," and the scene "Ma Qian" already showed signs of being rushed.

### Striving for the Masses

— Zhang Bingdu

After reading "The Future of Drama in Shanghai" - Dedicated to the Drama Workers of the "Isolated Island"

We cannot deny that in recent years, the "Green Treasure Theatre" has occupied a very superior position in the entertainment industry. They have been performing regularly in this "isolated island" in the form of spoken drama for two years now. To be able to maintain it for so long and gain so many audiences, I think it is really not to be underestimated.

I remember once meeting their person in charge. He told me: "Drama cannot be separated from the masses. We are able to have today completely because of the support of a large number of audiences." Because if there are no audiences, how can we stand firm? He also said: "We have clearly seen this point. Most of the people who come to see the play are from the leisure class, and it is this part and other parts of the people who need to be educated by drama. It is not easy to attract this part of the people, especially the ladies, but now they have become our regular audiences. Every time we change a new play, we always have their patronage."

However, we have to say that when we treat this part of the audience with a straight face and seriously teach them, it would be too inappropriate! People spend money, and the main thing is naturally not to come to listen to lessons! However, we are prepared to make them be educated. For the sake of skill and education, we still cater to this part of the audience, but we don't excessively indulge them. We want to make them understand, every sentence must hit their hearts, and make them feel that we are very close to them and willing to sympathize, and then there will be influence. Even if we lower the standard a little, we are willing. -- Appropriately lowering it is still the skill of striving for the masses. Therefore, we have gained a large number of audiences, and at the same time, we can exert the due power of drama on this large number of audiences."

Regarding these, I hope that drama workers can accept the living facts with the greatest humility!

### Idle Talk about the Entertainment World Written by Dong Yun, Illustrated by Xiu Yan

(18) Yongtan

Yongtan was once banned in the past because the expressions and lyrics were too obscene!

Especially in low-taste amusement venues, they use purely pornographic performances to numb the audience.

Once, at a festive banquet, I saw them perform a play called "Swinging the Lake Boat," and the interlude was "Eighteen Touches," touching one place, singing one place, performing earnestly, without any scruples! The male actor also took this opportunity to take advantage of the female actor. This example shows that it cannot exist without serious reform.

### Anecdotes from the Opera World

— Xu Muyun

Actors and Opium

Da Yuan's qin teacher was his uncle, Mr. Chen. Every night he would visit his home. Da Yuan worked very hard, so even though he was using Qing Kui's method of getting injections to quit smoking, the homework of practicing his voice every night was still uninterrupted. Who would have thought that after a few days, his voice felt unwell. At the same time, Gao Laoqing also discovered this problem. After testing it with a huqin, not only could he not produce a single word, but even speaking was so hoarse that he couldn't be heard. Da Yuan was almost scared to death when he heard this. He thought to himself, we make a living by our voice, relying entirely on this throat. If the capital is lost, then there will be no food for the rest of our lives. Therefore, he immediately dismissed Dr. Guo, relit the lamp, and started smoking again. Fortunately, he realized it early, so his voice was not affected. Unfortunately, Qing Kui's good voice was finished. If it weren't for Chu Cheng Lao Si's old friendship, inviting him to teach opera at the opera school and earning two hundred and eighty yuan a month, he would probably have starved to death. It was once rumored that Lao Qing committed suicide. It is said that one day, while chatting with teacher Cai (who also taught young male roles and was quite insidious and jealous), Cai asked him: How much do you earn a month? He replied: A hundred yuan a month. Cai then mocked him and said: You used to be a big star who earned ten thousand silver dollars a month. How come you only earn a hundred now? Someone like me earns a hundred and twenty. When Lao Qing returned home, the more he thought about it, the more unpleasant it became. He said to Lian Kui: This way, we might as well drink some opium paste and end this life. Later, after the family repeatedly dissuaded him, the matter was dropped. In all fairness, Qing Kui is a very generous person. Therefore, Sheng Linling's performance in "Golden Age" was so successful, achieving both fame and fortune, and returning north with praise. Lao Qing has a good son and can also hold his head high. (112)

### Yan Chuntang Takes a Fancy to "Sai Jinhua"

Although Yan Chuntang has now handed over full authority of the Yihua Company to his two sons, Youxiang and Kejun, he still plans everything for the company in his spare time. Moreover, he occasionally visits the photography set to see the work efficiency of the actors. He saw that Sun Jing's performance in "Fragrant River Songstress" was excellent, and signed a three-year contract with him.

Recently, the Shanghai Drama Society performed "Sai Jinhua." Yan Chuntang took a fancy to her. The day before yesterday, he specially called the Xigong Theatre and booked several seats, personally accompanying Propaganda Director Ye Daidai to see the play. After watching it, he praised it greatly. Currently, Daidai is collecting the two scripts of Xia Yan and Xiong Fosi as a reference. However, whether he will adapt it himself or ask someone else to write it has not yet been decided. But Yan Chuntang's decision to bring "Sai Jinhua" to the screen is absolutely true. (Hua)
