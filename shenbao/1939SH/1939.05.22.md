### The Huajun's Tactics of Luring the Enemy Deep Have Been Very Successful

A reporter from Northern Hubei recently arrived at the front line in Northern Hubei to inspect. He met with two commanders one after another and learned about the recent course of the war in Northern Hubei. Now, a brief record is as follows: The Japanese army's decision to attack our Northern Hubei adopted a strategy of central breakthrough and flanking encirclement in the Suixian area. After five days of attack, it was first defeated at Ta'erwan and then at Yinjiadian. None of the planned attempts were successful. At that time, the Huajun had repeatedly decided to deliberately break a gap in the front line to lure the enemy deep. The enemy fell for the trick every time. As a result, more than two Japanese regiments were eliminated before and after. This tactic was named "opening the mouth of the bag to catch hairy rats" by a certain military strategist of ours. Six days later, the enemy failed to attack the right flank, so it attacked on the left flank, that is, all the Japanese troops in Zhongbei were transferred north. At that time, we had already seen through the enemy's intention to eliminate our main force, so we dealt with them on the one hand and redeployed the front line on the other hand. In addition to surrounding Suixian with two large groups of troops in the two directions of Sui Bei and Zhe He, the Japanese army also窜 out a group from the Jingshan direction, extending north to the vicinity of Zaoyang, and then divided into two routes to encircle Zaoyang on the left and right. At the same time, the Japanese army in Zhongxiang Yangzi area was divided into two groups and moved north,窜至 near the Xianghua Road, and then divided into four routes to cut off the Xiangzao Highway. The enemy thus formed multiple blockade lines on the Xianghua Road, thinking that the main force would definitely move west, so that our main force would be destroyed under its layers of blockade lines. Unexpectedly, our army had already moved north at this time, causing the enemy to pounce on a big emptiness. On the 12th, our troops from Southern Henan arrived and gave the enemy a head-on blow, so the enemy fled southeast in a panic, and was attacked by us everywhere. Its predicament in the quagmire can be obtained from this a powerful 瞪明. (21st Telegram)

Editorial

### Expectations for Today's League of Nations Administrative Council Standing Committee Meeting

The 105th Standing Committee Meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council will be held in Geneva today. According to frequent telegrams, among the agenda items of this Standing Committee meeting, there are two proposals of a political nature: one is the issue of fortifying the Aland Islands in Finland, and the other is China's proposal on the War of Resistance. In addition, unrelated to this meeting, but due to the convenience of diplomatic representatives from various countries gathering in Geneva to exchange opinions, or even conduct negotiations, there are three important matters: 1. The issue of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union concluding an alliance to form an anti-aggression group; 2. The issue of the Free City of Danzig; 3. The issue of revising the League of Nations Charter and reorganizing the League of Nations.

The League of Nations once served as the center of international affairs. Although it had its congenital defects from the beginning due to the United States not participating, and the Soviet Union's accession boosted its influence, thereafter, Japan used force to invade China, and the League of Nations failed to impartially apply the League's charter; Italy launched an expedition to Abyssinia, and the League of Nations launched a deformed sanction that was ineffective; Japan, Italy, and Germany successively declared their withdrawal from the League of Nations; thus, the prestige and reputation of the League of Nations gradually declined, and it almost ceased to be the center of international affairs. However, this is still the largest international group, and its function is still questionable, but the charter still exists. It is believed that human wisdom and action, the development and progress of personnel, will inevitably resemble the folding of waves, and cannot be expected to be as straight as an arrow; therefore, those who create international brightness and maintain international order should hope to strengthen the League of Nations and enrich it to reach health, rather than hoping to abandon the League of Nations, reform it, and start anew. Even with regard to the United States, if it is always hindered by isolationism, regards the New World as a separate paradise, and believes that all demons cannot enter, and can be alone; otherwise, although the United States is extremely rich and strong, and its actions are important, it is like the leader of both hemispheres, but once it decides to participate in the world's international organizations, it will certainly not seek a foundation outside the League of Nations. Perhaps some people belittle the League of Nations' frequent setbacks, such as the sacrificial sheep of the lunar announcement, but in fact, this is not the case; the League of Nations is still complete in its five senses, outstanding in its intelligence, but its blood and energy are insufficient, and its instincts are not strong. It is the son of a civilized group of people. And the current member states of the League of Nations,. Cherish it, love it, support it, and hope that its morality and industry will improve day by day, and it will be strong and promising, and overcome what it bears as soon as possible; it is currently able to do one thing within its ability, do one thing, and do three or five things if it can do three or five things. As for the United States in the League of Nations, it is also a moral friendship that is closely related to pain and well-being. Only because of this, we sincerely hope that its administrative council meeting today will be vigorous and show great achievements! With the greatness of expression and achievement, expecting the Standing Committee of the League of Nations today, is it too extravagant? Although the League of Nations has its universality, it is actually focused on Europe, and the great power in the association is controlled by Britain and France; now the European continent is full of crises, and it is impossible to do anything, this is one; what the League's charter stipulates is ignored, feared, and opposed, how can it be expected to quickly revitalize the outline, this is two; those that have been proposed but not discussed, discussed but not decided, and decided but not implemented, are countless, let alone create something else, this is three. Yesterday's newspaper published a Reuters telegram from Geneva, saying that "The Danzig issue is not on the agenda, because everyone feels that it is not appropriate to deal with such an explosive issue at the moment;" a few words can prove the futility of extravagance.

However, there are those who should not think like this, and cannot view it like this. The gradual decline of the League of Nations' prestige and reputation was half self-inflicted and half due to the environment; as of today, international circumstances and politicians' understanding have been repeatedly decided by painful experiences and lessons, and they are no longer the same as before. To state one point: the League of Nations Charter has always been the same; however, in the past, the international community still retreated, compromised, and appeased, but now it is striving to organize anti-aggression groups, fearing that it is too late; try to measure, was the international situation in the past close to the League Charter? Is the current international situation close to the League Charter? Then how can we underestimate the League of Nations today and in the future because of its inability to achieve anything in the past. Furthermore, in terms of the League of Nations' environment, those who hated the League of Nations in the past were arrogant and imposing, but now they are tending to decline; in the past, the United States always maintained parallel relations with the League of Nations in diplomacy, but now the United States and the main member states of the League of Nations have begun to be consistent in action; then should the League of Nations not adapt to the environment and grind itself more? The husband's words are by no means a one-sided wish from the Far East. Reuters' London telegram on the 18th said:

"A delegation organized by Lord Cecil, President of the League of Nations Association. Former Indian Governor-General Lord Snell. And Lord Listowel, a Labor Party member of the House of Lords, will visit Foreign Secretary Halifax tomorrow to urge the British government to do its best in Geneva to take active action by the League of Nations to help China."

Also, a Havas telegram from London on the 20th said:

"The British Aid China Movement has just issued a statement requesting the League of Nations General Assembly to implement the resolutions passed by the Executive Council in the past, that is, the resolution advocating that each member state individually aid China, which should be implemented immediately. The method is no more than the following three points: (1) Refuse to supply Japan with war supplies. In particular, the export of aircraft to that country should be prohibited. (2) Boycott Japanese goods, so as to inflict a major blow on the country's economy in a short period of time. (3) Provide financial and economic assistance to China, so as to build the southwestern provinces, develop industrial cooperation movements, and relieve refugees in the war zone. The above actions should be adjusted by a committee established by the Executive Council to improve its efficiency. Recently, the governments of certain member states of the League of Nations have declared their willingness to support the collective security system. If the Executive Council of the League of Nations can help China, it will be a great contribution to the collective security system. Moreover, the United States is also willing to actively participate in the work of aiding China, which can be seen from President Roosevelt's recent words and deeds."

From these two examples, it can be seen that the world's public opinion is rising compared to the past, so the League of Nations should not be timid and unenterprising.

### Taking Responsibility for the World, China Is Fighting for Peace, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Expressed His Views at the Opening Ceremony of the Annual Meeting of the China Branch of the International Peace Association

(Chongqing) General Chiang Kai-shek, today expressed his views at the second annual meeting of the China Branch of the Second International Peace Movement, strongly condemning "appeasementism that has been destroyed and has no credibility," and requesting that "the majority of the world's rational citizens resist the minority of fanatics with firm determination." General Chiang continued, "This meeting of yours contains extremely important significance. At a time when the Sino-Japanese war is in progress and countries are preparing for war, you are gathering together to seek ways to stabilize world peace. The main point of this is self-evident. Because the current world's storms and waves are running counter to the great goal of your work. If you achieve something, it is also an expression that this meeting has the determination. This determination must be based on the only remaining realistic part today. The majority of the world's rational citizens resist the minority of fanatics with firm awakening, and not based on appeasementism that has been destroyed and has no credibility. A government will never allow criminals in its country to operate freely in the government, so this world must also recognize those irresponsible rulers who go against the right path and lead their countries to act in violation of world peace, and should find ways to punish them, because their actions are no different from a criminal in society. Regarding China's war of resistance against Japanese aggression, General Chiang said, I sincerely hope that our struggle, its completion or not too late, can avoid a larger war including the whole world. Only countries that love peace and are deeply aware, "can accelerate," and countries that love peace help China accelerate the completion of its task of resistance, so that a war that includes the whole world and is far greater can be avoided, then the value of our efforts to resist the war is several times greater than this. Therefore, we are not only fighting for ourselves, but also for the world. , We feel this responsibility to the whole world, so our determination and courage have increased sharply. The reason why we try our best to endure the pain of war is that we hope that the world will be aware of the morbid psychology and perverse measures of the aggressors, weigh the gains and losses of peace, and thus be able to produce good results. General Chiang also said that he wishes the world's people to witness the true face of war, remember it in their hearts, and take action in time. This is the consolation I seek for the suffering China has suffered. Finally, Mr. Chiang expressed that I would like to take this opportunity to offer the above views to you, and I would like to extend my most sincere goodwill to you and wish you success in this valuable effort.

The Dutch East Indies is a producing area for quinine and other medicines. Overseas Chinese here are actively purchasing medicines and have donated 10 tons of quinine, as it is reported that epidemics are prevalent in the war zone. (21st Reuters Telegram)

### Letter from Japanese Anti-War Parliamentarian Saito to His Son

—Sincere and Earnest Words—

Uetaka, April 26th. After the Hua army recaptured Gao'an in April, Saito, a Japanese citizen and political party member, sent a letter to his son. The translation and publication are as follows:

The depths of winter have passed, but the weather is still bitterly cold. I don't know what the situation is like on the battlefield. I trust you are safe. As for the situation in the homeland, it is generally the same as what is recorded in the newspapers that I send you daily. There are no major changes. Your letter said that you asked someone to bring back some items, but they have not been received here. I am notifying you specifically. On January 20th, I sent you a package of慰问品 (comfort goods). The items inside should be carefully inspected and not be known to your companions, lest you be in danger. Your mother and I are both well, and your sister is also healthy. I am very busy every day, and there are many more comrades. The future is very hopeful, so please don't worry. I hope you take care of your health and don't let sickness invade you. I pray to the gods and Buddhas for you morning and evening, asking the Buddha to have great compassion. Mr. Kurabayashi has also been dispatched to North China. I don't know if you will be able to meet. The photo you took on the banks of the Xiu River has been sent to me. I will continue to send you newspapers until you return. I have not seen a single person I know who went to China to participate in the war return home safely. Your sister has been sobbing incessantly since you went to war, and she goes to Yawatan Shrine every day to pray for you. If there is any special news or instructions, I will send them to you immediately. I hope you take care. I want to tell you something very confidential. Saito, during the February 26th Incident, vehemently denounced the warlords in the Diet, causing a sensation at the time. He strongly opposed the war of aggression against China. This letter is beautifully written and easy to read, and it is enough to prove that the people of Japan deeply resent the deployment of troops and the burden on the people, and it sufficiently expresses the emotions of the Japanese people suffering because of the war.

Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui issued a statement here today, again appealing to the League of Nations to urge member states to take the following actions: (1) Take collective action to stop Japan's aggression in China; (2) Stop supplying Japan with military raw materials; (3) Sever financial and trade relations with Japan; (4) Implement the resolutions previously passed by the League of Nations, and please pay attention to the resolution passed on September 9, 1938, condemning the bombing of non-combatants, stating that the Japanese side's continued bombing of undefended cities, causing the deaths and injuries of dozens of civilians, including women and children, is intended to intimidate the Chinese people, but this inhumane behavior only serves to strengthen the Chinese people's determination to resist until the triumph of justice over force. (Reuters telegram, 21st)

(Chongqing) The Chinese Society for the League of Nations has telegraphed the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, to be forwarded to the directors of the Standing Committee of the Executive Council, requesting that sanctions be implemented against Japan to uphold justice and maintain humanity. (Telegram, 21st)

(London) The 105th session of the League of Nations Executive Council is scheduled to open in Geneva on the 22nd of this month. The application submitted by China has been placed on the agenda. The British Aid China Campaign Committee has issued a statement requesting that the resolutions passed by the League of Nations General Assembly and the Executive Council, namely, that member states should individually aid China, be immediately implemented. The methods are no more than three: (1) Do not supply Japan with war materials, including aircraft, which should be prohibited from being exported to that country; (2) Boycott Japanese goods, so as to inflict a major blow on the country's economic base in a short period of time; (3) Provide financial and economic assistance to China, so as to build the southwestern provinces, develop the industrial cooperative movement, and relieve refugees in the war zone. The above measures should be adjusted by a committee established by the Executive Council in order to improve efficiency. Recently, some member governments of the League of Nations have stated that they are willing to uphold the collective security system. If the League of Nations Executive Council can effectively assist China, it will be a great contribution to the collective security system. In addition, the United States is also willing to actively participate in aiding China, as can be seen from President Roosevelt's recent words and actions. (Havas telegram, 20th)

### Ambassador Johnson Passes Through Japan to China

(Yokohama) United States Ambassador to China Johnson boarded the President Coolidge today to continue his journey to China to resume his post. Accompanying Mr. Johnson was his wife and others. Yesterday, Mr. Johnson met with officials from the U.S. Embassy in Japan all day. (Associated Press telegram, 21st)

### Although the War in China is Fierce, Efforts to Suppress Opium Continue, Japan Openly Encourages Opium in Occupied Areas, Chinese and American Representatives State at the League of Nations

(Geneva) The Advisory Committee on Opium of the League of Nations recently continued to meet today. The Chinese representative, Hu Shih-tse, Minister to Switzerland, presented a report on the country's government's efforts to ban drugs, stating that the consumption of various narcotics is extremely harmful to the war of resistance, and it is necessary to ban them. Therefore, various effective measures have been taken to stop the sale of opium and heroin, and to reduce the number of opium smokers, hoping that those under the age of 45 who smoke opium will completely quit by 1941. All these measures have been effective and can be formally confirmed by neutral parties. For example, the annual report of the Shanghai International Settlement and the report published by the French government in Vietnam in 1937 are clear evidence. On the contrary, the harm of various drugs in the occupied areas of China is painful to speak of. The Japanese side not only does not prohibit them, but openly encourages them. Taking Shanghai as an example, since the occupation, it has been very different from the past. This can be seen from the report submitted by the Public Concession there last year. There are three objectives by which the Japanese side systematically poisons the Chinese people: a certain Japanese agency can profit from it to allocate funds for aggression; Japanese and Korean ruffians who are not tolerated in Japan are ordered by the Japanese authorities to come to China to sell drugs for a living; and to weaken China's resistance and lure traitors. The American representative, Fuller, spoke next, stating that the Chinese government is still working hard to ban drugs despite the difficult circumstances, which is commendable. Regarding the sale of various narcotics in the occupied areas of China, the U.S. government is still constantly receiving various news, which is very disturbing. The Japanese authorities have not taken effective measures in these areas to cooperate in banning narcotics, but in the view of the U.S. government, the harm of drugs in the Far East can be greatly improved. There are three ways: (1) The Japanese government should strictly order the authorities stationed in the area to prohibit the import of opium into the occupied areas; (2) The quantity of opium shipped from Iran to the Far East seems to have increased rather than decreased recently. The government of that country should immediately take effective measures to prohibit its shipment to the Far East; (3) The Portuguese government should take effective measures to cooperate in preventing the sale of narcotics and not allow Macau Island to become a base for drug trafficking.

### U.S. Holds Commercial Week, Hull Delivers Speech, Peace Policy Should Be Based on Understanding, Not on Surrender to Force

(Washington) The U.S. "Commercial Week" opened today. The opening speech written by President Roosevelt was read on his behalf by Secretary of State Hull. It stated, "Maintaining peaceful relations is the ideal of the vast majority of countries in the world. The main goal of American foreign policy is also here. What we hope for and where our goals lie is in peaceful trade, so that normal conditions can be restored." Secretary of State Hull then gave a speech, strongly arguing that the policy of concluding mutual reciprocal trade agreements is beneficial to everyone. "The peace we speak of is peace based on understanding, not peace based on surrendering to superior force. Any attempt to replace fair negotiations with the threat of strong armor and sharp weapons should be stopped. The agreements that countries should establish must ultimately limit armaments and reduce armaments." Once the atmosphere of mutual suspicion between countries is eliminated and satisfactory agreements are established, the true wealth and true enjoyment of all countries in the world will increase accordingly. This is the plan we are promoting, both to do our best and to adapt to our country's position in the world. (Havas telegram, 21st)

### Japan's Attitude Towards Europe Still Unknown

(Washington) It is reported that the Japanese cabinet's five-minister meeting has decided to refuse to participate in the military alliance treaty of Germany and Italy. Regarding this, diplomatic circles here have not received formal news from Tokyo that is credible. However, it is said that Japan will not sign a military alliance with Germany and Italy. From the withdrawal of the Japanese Marine Corps from Gulangyu, it can be seen that the government is unwilling to have friction with the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, so as not to increase difficulties in China. In addition, regarding the issue of protecting American interests in China, if the Japanese government's diplomatic policy has been determined, it is hoped that it will submit a note to the United States to explain its attitude. (Havas telegram, 20th)

(Tokyo) The central members of the Japanese cabinet met yesterday to discuss the attitude that Japan should take towards the European situation. Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, Navy Minister Yonai, and Finance Minister Ishiwata Sotaro were all present. There are rumors that Japan has decided not to participate in the military treaties of Germany and Italy, but that in the event of war, Japan will adopt a benevolent neutral policy towards Germany and Italy. This is considered to be pure fantasy and not to be believed. Political figures believe that the Japanese government has not yet reached a consensus on the above issues. The military faction and the younger generation all advocate concluding a military alliance with Germany and Italy, but the diplomatic faction and party leaders do not think so. They believe that the best policy is to conclude a military alliance with the sole purpose of resisting the Soviet Union. Beyond this scope is not in Japan's interest. (Hai Tong telegram, 21st)

### Japan's Public Debt Last Year Reached More Than 43 Billion Yuan

(Tokyo) According to an announcement by the Ministry of Finance, as of the end of 1938, the public bonds issued by the Japanese government totaled 16,222,728,000 yen. Those purchased by financial institutions accounted for 8,701,921,000 yen (53%), those held by government agencies accounted for 4,992,593,000 yen (27.7%), and those held by private temples and shrines accounted for 3,028,213,000 yen (18.7%). This total is 4,329,775,000 yen more than at the end of 1937. (Reuters telegram, 21st)

### British Foreign Secretary Presents Compromise Plan to Soviet Ambassador Again, Negotiations Now Taking Place in Geneva, England, France, and the Soviet Union Can Sign a Military Alliance

(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky arrived here by the same train from Paris. Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately held talks with Ambassador Maisky, informing him of the details of the meeting with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet in Paris yesterday. Ambassador Maisky also reported everything to his government by long-distance telephone afterwards. It is generally believed that the agreement between England, France, and the Soviet Union can be announced in a short period of time, but in any case, nothing will be truly decided before the 24th of this month, because any decision must be formally established after the British Cabinet approves it at a meeting on that day. (Havas telegram, 21st)

(London) Regarding the organization of an anti-aggression group, according to the diplomatic correspondent of The Sunday Times, after Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax held talks with French cabinet members in Paris yesterday afternoon, the plan for cooperation between England, France, and the Soviet Union has been negotiated. Its content stipulates that England, France, and the Soviet Union sign a military alliance treaty, but it will only take effect when one of the three signatory countries is attacked. "This plan has distinguished between 'direct' aggression and 'indirect' aggression. Direct aggression refers to an attack on one of England, France, or the Soviet Union. 'Indirect' aggression refers to an attack on any of the countries guaranteed by the three countries. The military alliance treaty to be signed by the three countries is specifically aimed at dealing with direct aggression. In other words, if one of the three signatory countries is directly attacked by another country, the other two countries must immediately send troops to assist. If only indirect aggression is encountered, in other words, if one of the three countries, England, France, and the Soviet Union, guarantees one country, is attacked, and asks the guaranteeing country to send troops to assist, then England, France, and the Soviet Union must provide assistance in an appropriate manner. In this way, on the one hand, the advantages of signing an alliance treaty between England, France, and the Soviet Union can be preserved, and on the other hand, all concerns of the countries concerned who are unwilling to cooperate too closely with the Soviet Union can be eliminated. It can be said to be a win-win situation." (Havas telegram, 21st)

(Moscow) The dismissal of Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin from going to Geneva to meet with British and French diplomatic officials is not taken seriously in Moscow. Moscow has never announced this matter. According to popular opinion, Potemkin does not have the authority to make policies, and there is no difference between him and Ambassador Maisky to the United Kingdom, who represents the Soviet Union at the League of Nations. Soviet officials and the Soviet press did not say a word about the remarks made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain at the House of Commons on Friday regarding the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. This is probably an indication that the Soviet Supreme Authority has not yet prepared to provide a new counter-proposal. At the same time, well-informed sources believe that Maisky has been instructed to continue negotiations with the British Foreign Secretary in Geneva. The result may be a compromise between British and Soviet differences, which is unknown. (Reuters telegram, 21st)

### British and French Foreign Ministers in Paris Agree on Policy Towards the Soviet Union

(Paris) After British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax arrived here, he held a long-term talk with Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet at the Ministry of the Army in the afternoon. In addition to a few experts assisting, British Ambassador Phipps also participated until 7:50 p.m. The official did not issue a communique on what happened. Prime Minister Daladier then met with reporters, saying only that the talks were extremely harmonious. British and French cabinet members and experts then dined together at the Ministry of the Army. There were eight people at the table, and the meeting continued. Foreign Secretary Halifax then led Malkin, a legal expert from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Stronge, Director of Central European Affairs, and Baker, Director of Intelligence, on a train to Geneva to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting. Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky also traveled on the same train. (Havas telegram, 21st)

(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Halifax, French Prime Minister Daladier, and French Foreign Minister Bonnet discussed the entire international situation for two hours at a meeting at the Ministry of the Army last night, paying particular attention to efforts to recruit the Soviet Union into the anti-aggression front. It is reported that this decision has found that the British and French views are completely consistent. British and French diplomatic authorities will continue to talk in Geneva. Before the two sides gathered at the Ministry of the Army for talks, Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky had visited Daladier. After French Foreign Minister Bonnet arrived in Geneva, he will discuss with Maisky. The general impression here is that although the talks between the British and French authorities are very satisfactory, an Anglo-Soviet agreement may not be concretely established within a few days. A major understanding will only be reached after the Geneva Conference. However, all sectors of the Soviet Union here hope that an Anglo-Soviet agreement can be established soon (Reuters, 21st)

(Paris) The newspapers commented on the progress of negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. The Radical Socialist Party's newspaper, Enterprise, reported, "Last night, the British and French authorities believed that the principles of the Anglo-Soviet agreement were expected to be established in Geneva by the 23rd of this month, and the formal signing of the agreement will be next week. This is also believed in Berlin. The German political police received intelligence on the 19th that the French military authorities had strongly urged the Polish army representative that Poland should be within the scope of the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance mechanism on the day it is established, and allow the Soviet Union to assist with all its forces. It is reported that the Polish side has agreed. In addition, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was reportedly ordered by the Führer Hitler to transfer the trend of the establishment of an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union and between Poland and the Soviet Union to the Propaganda Department, so as to instill this view in the general public in Germany, so as to avoid panic when hearing the news temporarily. The Communist Party's L'Humanité reported, "Soviet cooperation is necessary for France. Regarding this, the French Foreign Minister should take the British-French consultations as a starting point and explain it to the British government in detail." The right-wing Le Petit Parisien reported, "The Soviet Union has a non-aggression pact with France, and also maintains relations with Turkey. Britain maintains relations with France and has also concluded an agreement with Turkey. This kind of direct and indirect chain relationship is mutually beneficial. Therefore, it is firmly believed that Britain and the Soviet Union will be able to find a way to clear away all the difficulties in the current negotiations at one fell swoop." (Havas telegram, 21st)

### French Foreign Minister Reaffirms Firm Policy, Decides to Prevent All Aggression Within Europe

French Foreign Minister Bonnet arrived here from Algiers this morning at 8:50 a.m., and immediately attended the Veterans Congress, delivering a speech, stating that France is committed to peace, but is determined to prevent all aggression within Europe and defend the heritage of our ancestors. "The boundaries of mainland France and the colonial empire were drawn with the blood of our ancestors, and we must maintain them." To this day, a glorious and neutral path must be maintained, which has been understood by most European nations. The United Kingdom and Poland have joined the mutual guarantee system. The United Kingdom and France are also conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union and Turkey respectively to form an anti-aggression group. Before these negotiations are completed, it is difficult to report them. In addition, France and the United States also maintain closer friendship. "We firmly believe that violence will never become a permanent system in Europe. France will never listen to the idea of military control growing in the world." All of our citizens must abide by discipline at this critical moment. (Havas telegram, 21st)

(Paris) Foreign Minister Bonnet went to the southwestern city of Acaz on this evening to attend the National Federation of European War Veterans, and will travel to Geneva via Lyon tomorrow to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting. Before his departure, he told reporters that "the results of today's talks between British and French cabinet members are very satisfactory. All parties concerned have expressed sincerity and there is great hope of reaching an agreement." (Havas telegram, 20th)

### Germany and Lithuania Agree on Economic Issues

(Berlin) After Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbsys came here and signed a commercial treaty with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and held lengthy talks, the official issued a communique stating that all economic issues between Germany and Lithuania had been resolved satisfactorily and that the two sides had established a lasting good-neighborly relationship, thereby gaining a new foundation. (Havas telegram, 20th)

### Analysis of the Current European Situation

(Paris) Diplomatic figures here recently stated that it will become clear within the next few days which way European countries will turn regarding the Rome-Berlin Axis and the London-Paris Axis. The key is of unusual importance. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax is scheduled to come here to hold talks with French government authorities. He will certainly strive to continue efforts to organize an anti-aggression bloc. At the same time, Germany and Italy are scheduled to sign a political and military treaty on the 22nd of this month. From now on, the egoistic principles of these countries in politics will further develop into close cooperation in all aspects, especially in military affairs. These countries are also stepping up the exchange of views with the Japanese government, hoping that Japan will express its attitude before the signing of the political and military treaty between Germany and Italy. The diplomatic circles here believe that Japan's agreement to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact is undoubtedly certain. However, it is uncertain whether it will go a step further and join the political and military treaty between Germany and Italy. Japanese figures here also said that the governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan still need to conduct lengthy negotiations, but it is highly doubtful whether Japan will willingly accept substantial restrictions to resist the United Kingdom and the United States. As for Spain, General Franco, the Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army, also seems unwilling to sign a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy. At the same time, the United Kingdom and France are sparing no effort in organizing an anti-aggression bloc. The main key lies in whether the Soviet Union will come out to cooperate. If the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union announce the establishment of an agreement, they can effectively restrain the ambitions of the Axis countries. It is reported that the British government will submit a new proposal with a broader scope in accordance with the wishes of the Soviet Union. In this way, it is not impossible for the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union to reach an agreement. In addition, certain countries that were previously wary of the Soviet Union have also changed their opinions one after another. Among them, the transformation of Poland is the most significant. In addition, there are still several countries that are hovering between authoritarian and democratic countries, and will not truly join the democratic front until the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union are successful. This is the same as the significant impact felt by the Balkan Peninsula countries after the United Kingdom and Turkey agreed on a mutual assistance agreement. (Havas, 20th)

Cuneo When Italian Prime Minister Mussolini arrived here today, tens of thousands of Italian Blackshirt troops shouted, "March on Paris!" Mussolini then addressed the Blackshirts, saying, "Germany and Italy both desire peace, but when necessary, we are prepared to force it by force. The German-Italian united front, with 150 million people, will not be resisted by anyone." After Mussolini finished speaking, the crowd shouted, "We demand the occupation of Nice (in southeastern France, bordering Italy) and Savoy (a province in eastern France, bordering Italy)." Mussolini finally said, "From now on, I will no longer speak. If the facts require it, the Italian people will speak." Regarding the German-Italian Axis, Mussolini pointed out, "This strong axis desires peace, but if the democratic countries attempt to prevent our irresistible desire, we must force it." When Mussolini mentioned the democratic countries, the crowd shouted, "Cowards! Cowards!" Mussolini also asked the crowd to pay attention to the German-Italian alliance to be signed tomorrow. (Associated Press, 21st)

(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini of Italy gave a speech yesterday in Cerea, in the Medical District of northern Italy, saying, "After the signing of the German-Italian alliance, it will become an impeccable group of 150 million people. This kind of group is extremely terrifying in name and in strength, and desires peace, but whenever great conservative and reactionary democratic countries want to prevent our irresistible advance, we will force them to have peace. We will not speak for the time being; when the time is right, the Italian people will speak. Italy has 45 million people, including 10 million soldiers, all of one heart and one mind (the crowd shouted). Your voices prove this statement. I have already made it clear in Turin. Today's statement is just a supplement to the previous one. In short, when necessary, the Italian people will speak." Italian Foreign Minister Ciano went to Berlin to sign the alliance tomorrow. (Reuters, 20th)

(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini's short speech in Cuneo, northern Italy, today has been commented on by diplomatic figures here, who believe that the international situation is likely to become serious as a result. This impression can be clearly seen in the article published by the semi-official International Relations News. The newspaper stated that in addition to its demands for Tunis, the Suez Canal, and the port of Gibraltar, Italy should also demand that the provisions of Article 13 of the Secret London Treaty of 1913 be implemented. According to that article, at the end of the European War, the United Kingdom and France should make concessions to Italy on colonial issues. (Havas, 20th)

(Paris) The Radical Socialist Party's "New Era" newspaper recently commented on Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech in Cuneo. "Since the United Kingdom and France have neither attacked Albania nor eroded the land of other countries, the United Kingdom does not covet the Polish Corridor, and France has not demanded the Italian colony of Libya, Prime Minister Mussolini claims that the German-Italian group wishes for peace and is prepared to force other countries to accept peace. If other countries have not threatened peace, then what is there to force them to accept peace? Could it be that Head of State Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini are simply mocking themselves?" The newspaper continues, "The Italian people, witnessing the strength of foreign forces and the grandeur of their military might, are quite uneasy, and they all worry that Italy will be defeated. This is why the Prime Minister has to exaggerate the German-Italian alliance relationship. This can be thought of as a reason." (Havas, 21st)

Perpignan A thousand Italian volunteers arrived here by ship from Spain yesterday. This is the first batch of Italian troops to leave Spain after General Franco's triumphal parade in Madrid on Friday. (Reuters, 21st)

Madrid Authoritative sources said last night that German and Italian ammunition, airplanes, cannons, tanks, trucks, and various technical equipment will all remain in Spain as part of the Spanish army's equipment and will not be returned to Germany and Italy. Also, yesterday General Franco offered a sword to the statue of Saint Barbara Church, indicating that he had obtained divine protection after the victory. (Associated Press, 21st)

### Ciano Arrives in Berlin Yesterday

Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Commander-in-Chief of the Army General Brauchitsch, Minister of Aviation General Göring, General Milch representing the Ministry of Aviation, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Raeder, and Japanese Ambassador General Oshima, all welcomed them at the station. German and Italian national flags were hung throughout the city. The number of people gathered on the streets was not very large. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop immediately accompanied Foreign Minister Ciano and his party to their residence, and then returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work. Foreign Minister Ciano rested for a while, first went to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to lay a wreath, and then went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to return the visit of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and held talks for an hour. Then, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop hosted a banquet to welcome them. The diplomatic authorities of Germany and Italy are scheduled to formally sign the political and military treaty tomorrow. (Havas, 21st)

(Berlin) After Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived here, he went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at noon, accompanied by Italian Ambassador Attolico, to visit Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, "to continue the talks that had not been completed in Milan, Italy." Foreign Minister Ribbentrop then returned the visit to the Adlon Hotel and hosted a banquet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Those invited to attend included Italian Undersecretary of the Army General Pariani, Italian Ambassador Attolico, and various German party and government dignitaries. (Havas, 21st)

### All of Canada Celebrates the King's Birthday

Ottawa All of Canada celebrates the King's birthday today. The government authorities also held an unprecedented grand celebration on the lawn of the government office. The King reviewed the Canadian army on Parliament Hill, and there were thousands of viewers. This morning's program also included (1) the Queen laying the foundation stone for the new building of the Supreme Court of Ottawa; (2) the King and Queen touring Hull across the river; (3) the Governor General of Canada holding Parliament; (4) a parliamentary banquet; (5) fireworks. (Reuters, 20th)

Ottawa Today, the King and Queen participated in the government office garden party. The King and Queen mingled with the four thousand guests and chatted with those around them in a friendly manner. When parliamentarians held a banquet at the Laurier Building in the evening, the King and Queen came out to the balcony of the building to receive the people's respects. These people waited in the rain for several hours, and when they saw the royal appearance, they cheered in unison, echoing through the clouds. (Reuters, 20th)

### Chicago Authorities Provide Special Protection for Former Czech President

Chicago Special precautions were taken here last night to protect the life of former Czech President Benes. The authorities took this measure because they received an anonymous telegram from Paris stating, "Someone is planning to assassinate Mr. Benes." A large contingent of police officers was stationed around the hotel where Benes was staying, and they also thoroughly checked the people entering and leaving the hotel. (Associated Press, 21st)

### Serious Disputes on the Danzig Border National Socialist Party Members Destroy Checkpoints One German Killed

Warsaw Serious disturbances occurred again last night on the border between the Free City of Danzig and the German province of East Prussia. Several members of the National Socialist Party gathered in front of the Polish border checkpoint around 8:00 p.m., behaving aggressively and firing several shots. Polish border guards returned fire. At 11:00 p.m., a Danzig city police officer arrived at the scene and advised the border guards to withdraw from the checkpoint, saying that he could not be responsible for ensuring their safety. The border guards then withdrew to the town of Siemianowice to avoid the confrontation. National Socialist Party members immediately destroyed the checkpoint. When Mr. Chodacki, the senior Polish commissioner stationed in the Free City of Danzig, heard the news, he sent Deputy Commissioner Bielski to the scene to investigate. The Free City Senate refused to send police to protect him. Bielski's car was shot at by several Germans. The driver returned fire, killing one German. (Havas, 21st)

Warsaw After the anti-Polish incident in the town of Karosche, on the border between the Free City of Danzig and the German province of East Prussia, the city's people were quite agitated, fearing that other disturbances would follow. Regarding this matter, Chodacki, the Polish High Commissioner stationed in the city, has lodged a protest with the city senate. It is reported that the person who led the attack on the Polish checkpoint in the town was a member of the National Socialist Party named Androu. After the guards withdrew from the checkpoint under threat, the rioters destroyed all the houses and threw the furniture inside onto the street. When Polish Deputy Commissioner Bielski arrived to investigate, his car was also attacked by rioters. The tires and windows were broken. In a moment of desperation, the driver opened fire to resist. According to information obtained here, the Danzig City Senate has taken various emergency measures to ensure local security. However, Polish people believe that this disturbance is actually a provocative act by the Germans, which is enough to hinder the basic rights enjoyed by Poland in the city, that is, the right to manage customs duties. (Havas, 21st)

(Berlin) After the disturbance in Karosche, Free City of Danzig, the chairman of the city senate, Gmotze, presented a note to Polish High Commissioner Chodacki, expressing a protest in extremely strong terms, stating that when the disturbance occurred in the town, the car driver Moloski of Polish Deputy Commissioner Bergoski shot and killed citizen Grubbner, which was "outrageous" and could have a serious impact on the current relationship between the City of Danzig and Poland, and requested an immediate investigation to determine responsibility (Havas, 21st)

Danzig At the time of the disturbance in Karosche, on the border between the city and the German province of East Prussia, there were only four Polish railway workers at the scene. These people were recently arrested by the city authorities and imprisoned. (Havas, 21st)

### German Border Defense Claims to be Impregnable Only the Eastern Part is Not Completed

(Berlin) Lieutenant General Wither of the German General Staff published an article in the "People's Observer" yesterday, entitled "The Border Defense Project in the East and West of Germany." It is rare to find text about border defense secrets, so people generally passed it around and paid close attention to it. The article briefly stated, "The western border defense of Germany is indestructible and cannot be captured by manpower. Mountainous areas on the border are defended by troops accustomed to mountain warfare. The western defense line is built with layers of defensive works and stationed with elite troops, which can resist any attack. The southern defense line of Germany is also impregnable and can be guaranteed to be safe. As for the eastern defense line of Germany, the key points are Silesia, Pomerania, and East Prussia. The three governments are now conscripting workers to build defensive works. Dr. Todt's highway construction team is now engaged in planning the transportation network, which can be realized in a short period of time. At that time, the eastern defense will not be inferior to the western project. In short, if Poland is truly reckless, Germany's military strength will be victorious. (Haitong Electric, 21st)

(Berlin) After Head of State Hitler went to the west to inspect the defense works, he returned to the capital this afternoon. (Havas Electric, 20th)

Capital of Yugoslavia Political figures here stated that the agreement concluded between Turkey and the United Kingdom indicates that Turkey's interests are not limited to the Balkan Peninsula, but will extend to the Mediterranean, and thus the situation in the Balkans has changed. Yugoslav political figures believe that it is urgent for the foreign ministers of Yugoslavia and Romania to have direct contact under such circumstances to discuss whether Turkey's change in policy has actually withdrawn from the Balkan Entente. (Haitong Electric, 21st)

Capital of Romania Foreign Minister Gafencu set off for Turnu Severin this afternoon. At the same time, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Markovich is also scheduled to travel from his country's capital to the city to discuss the altered policies, and soon they will sail on the Danube River together to conduct talks. As is generally known, this negotiation is of an informational exchange nature. Foreign Minister Gafencu will not only exchange views with the South Country's Foreign Minister in the capacity of Romania's Foreign Minister, but also in the name of the annual chairman of the Standing Political Conference of the Balkan Entente. (Havas Electric, 20th)

### Transportation Blockage in Various Parts of North China

(Hong Kong) Tianjin news, transportation on all routes in North China is in a state of intermittency. Although the Japanese have begun full traffic on the Jinpu Railway, tickets to Pukou have been sold in Tianjin, but no passengers are asking about them. Moreover, this traffic, traveling south from Tianjin, cannot arrive on time. In recent days, the south-bound train is being destroyed from time to time. The travel time on the Pinghan and Pingsui Railways has also been inaccurate recently. It is said that 52 bridges on the Jindong section of the Beining Railway in the eastern Hebei area were once destroyed. (Electric, 20th)

### Dire Conditions in Inner Mongolia Under Japanese Military Control Commerce and Finance Controlled by Japanese Military Pseudo-Mongol Government Dominated by Japanese Advisors Suiyuan Cities Frequently Attacked by Chinese Army

The North China Daily News of May 14 reported a communication from Zhangjiakou: In February, a group of foreign journalists, under the leadership of Japanese officials, traveled to Suiyuan Guihua. According to information collected from the newspapers, after these people returned from this trip, they enthusiastically described the pleasant situation in Inner Mongolia. Almost like a second paradise, it was said that the area was peaceful and vast, trade was flourishing, local industry was developed, and the people were extremely happy and satisfied. If the reporters know that the situation there is similar to that of Zhangjiakou here, the reporter is quite surprised by these optimistic news. Therefore, some time ago, he returned from a trip to other towns with curiosity, but what is the basis for this? According to the reporter's observation,

The situation in Inner Mongolia is not only not optimistic, but in fact worse than before the Japanese military invasion. The prosperous export trade on which Guihua's prosperity depended in the past has now completely stopped. The reason is that the caravan roads starting from Gansu and southwestern Xinjiang are completely blocked. The Chinese army front line is only a few miles west of Baotou, the terminus of the Pingsui Railway. In the past, long camel columns slowly traveled along this ancient caravan road, traveling only one and a half miles per hour, carrying leather, wool, and other products from the Far West, and making huge profits. Not to mention the highly profitable opium caravans, all of this has stopped. No caravans now arrive in Baotou or Guihua. Secondly, in the northern Mongolian plains,

Bandits are rampant as before, so Chinese merchants who used to go to Mongolian yurts to buy products no longer risk going to these areas. In fact, the areas where people live have been devastated. Many villages are deserted, and the people are poor and in pain. Much of the land that has already been cultivated is now turned into pasture. On the other hand, the Mongols themselves no longer take their goods to the railway towns for sale, fearing that they will be forced to sell them at low prices set by the government. The only remaining export trade must go through the Mengcang Company. The company is nominally composed of six Mongolian merchants, but in fact it is entirely under

Japanese control and has a complete and absolute monopoly on all export products. Outsiders may not purchase wool, leather, or any other ordinary export items without special permission. When they were in Guihua, several German merchants also arrived in the area. Although they had special permits from the Japanese, they managed to purchase only the smallest amount of needed items after experiencing numerous difficulties, and left with very dissatisfied expressions. In short, the authorities have made it clear that they do not want outsiders to participate, and they are trying everything to prevent outsiders from entering the country. To stay in Inner Mongolia for a slightly longer period, one must obtain a special permit issued by the Japanese military authorities, and now it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain such a certificate. Not long after the establishment of the "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government," the Mengcang new banknotes began to circulate. However, no one trusts them. Although foreign exchange is strictly restricted and all exports and imports are controlled, the discount for exchanging Mengcang currency for legal tender is very large. As a result, in the past year and a half, all prices have doubled. Although salaries are also higher than before, they have not been able to compensate for the increased cost of living. Local retail commerce is still as good as before, but in addition to stores selling daily necessities, most customers are Japanese soldiers and civilians. In the past, the more wealthy Mongolian men and women flocked to Guihua every year to buy things, crowding the streets, but this is no longer seen. The so-called "foreign goods stores" that they especially liked to patronize have now become "luxury goods" display centers with sluggish business. In the countryside around the area, a lot of opium is planted. It is said that fields planting opium account for one-tenth of the total. This is probably because the supply of opium, which was often transported by caravans, is now being cut off.

The political situation does not seem to be as pleasant as the commercial and financial situation. Mongols and Japanese do not trust each other very much. Although the Mongolian government is nominally autonomous, it is actually dominated by Japanese advisors, and recently even manipulated by Japanese military representatives. The Mongolian princes know that they are in a subordinate position and are very unhappy, but they cannot do anything about it. The thousands of Mongolian troops recruited to fight against the Chinese army and suppress bandits, the so-called "Inner Mongolia Army," are extremely evil. The discipline is nonexistent, let alone combat. The Japanese themselves do not trust them either. These Mongolian troops, whenever they are sent out to suppress bandits, often loot villages and commit the most terrible atrocities, so the people hate them to the bone, even more than the Japanese troops. Because of the uselessness of the Mongolian army,

The regular Chinese army frequently launches attacks on various cities in Suiyuan, directly approaching the city walls without any losses. Sometimes, when the Chinese army waits for the enemy to approach and the Mongolian army sees that the situation is serious, they flee elsewhere. Because both the Japanese and the Mongols are dissatisfied, the reporter was quite nervous when he was in Guihua. Rumors spread throughout the city, saying that the "Mongolian Government" would move elsewhere, that the titular head of the government, Prince De, had already been deposed, and that the "Autonomous Government" would be completely abolished and the area would be under the direct rule of the Japanese military. Whether these rumors will become reality remains to be seen, but some changes will inevitably occur soon. As far as the welfare of the common people of Inner Mongolia is concerned, the current regime has certainly not made any improvements to the areas under its rule. In fact, as mentioned in the first paragraph of this article, the situation there is worse than in early 1937.

In short, there are three reasons: (1) general financial mismanagement; (2) the 90% of the population who are Chinese are as deeply opposed to the Japanese occupation as ever; (3) the Japanese have failed to win the favor and cooperation of the Mongols.

### Japanese Troops Invading Guangdong Commit Further Atrocities in Heshan and Gaoming, Reinforcements Continuously Arriving in Guangdong for All Fronts; Chinese Troops in Heshan Mount Highly Successful Counterattacks; Japanese Troops Harass Various Areas of Zhongshan

Hong Kong dispatch: Over the past week, the Japanese side has been increasing troop deployments to invade Guangdong, having transported them from Taiwan. A portion landed at Humen in Guangzhou and were distributed to the three defense lines of the East River, West River, and North River, as well as to replenish the forces lost in Jiangmen and Hui City. These replacement troops were mostly dispatched from Humen to Rongqi and Guizhou, which belong to Shunde. It is speculated that the Japanese aim is still focused on the southwestern areas of Guangdong Province, while taking a defensive posture on the Northeast River. The West River has strong Chinese military strength and the strategic importance of the Zhaoqing Gorge. Mines are laid along the river to prevent Japanese warships from easily crossing. On land, Chinese troops tightly control the Lubao line, forming a strategic partnership with the Chinese troops on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway in the North River, controlling the Chantan Highway and containing the northwestern suburbs of Guangzhou. Therefore, the Japanese have recently only held Jiangcun on the North River Railway, temporarily connecting with Japanese troops in Huaxian and Conghua. The main force of the Japanese army in the northeast is concentrated in Taipingchang in Conghua, coordinating with the Japanese troops in Zengcheng on the eastern route. Another force is gathered in Longkou Village and Longxiang City in Huaxian, echoing the Japanese troops in Jiangcun. In recent days, patrols from both sides have made contact. In the North River, they are contending between Xin Street and the river. In the West River, the two armies are fighting for the Fengsong area on the Chantan Road. On the East River front, both sides have gained and lost in Fuhexu. Artillery fire occasionally erupts near Zengcheng. Along the West River coast, the two armies are facing each other across the river without major advances. This is a general overview of the recent war situation in Guangdong Province.

Since the Japanese army is taking a defensive position on the northeast fronts, the reinforcements arriving from Taiwan over the past month have mostly been dispatched to Jiangmen and Xinhui, hoping to gather the remnants, invade Heshan and Gaoming, circumvent the southern bank of the West River, and raid Guibian. After being replenished, the Japanese troops in Xinhui suddenly advanced along the Xinhui-Heshan Highway from the 11th to the 12th of this month. They first sent seven or eight aircraft to bomb key points on the highway in the Niushan, Duruan, Pingling, and Jinggen areas. No less than 50 bombs were dropped, but the Chinese troops near Pingling had strong positions and natural defenses. After the Japanese planes bombed at will, the Japanese troops rushed to Jinggen. The Chinese troops suddenly intercepted them, causing the Japanese to panic and flee. However, they were still unwilling to give up and sent 2,000 infantry and 600 cavalry to attack the Chinese positions in Jinggen, suffering heavy casualties. Since the Japanese troops on the Xinhui-Heshan Road were unsuccessful, they changed their plan to harass the coast of Heshan by waterway, hoping to support the advance of the Japanese troops on the Xinhui-Heshan Road and flank Heshan, attempting to spy on Gaoming. On the 13th of this month, 2,000 to 3,000 Japanese troops gathered in Jiujiang, along with more than 30 motorboats and a shallow-water warship, patrolling the Jiujiang River Qingyi area. At around 6 a.m. on the 14th, several Japanese aircraft were sent to bomb the positions of the Chinese troops in Gulao and Shaping, which belong to Heshan, to cover the landing of the land forces by motorboat. Six to seven hundred Japanese troops attacked Panbaokang in Shaping. The Chinese troops initially retreated strategically but then launched a fierce counterattack after the Japanese troops landed. The Japanese troops failed to establish a foothold and suffered heavy casualties, forcing them to flee back on their original boats. The Chinese artillery took the opportunity to unleash firepower, firing along Gulao, Heqing, and Shaping. Two Japanese boats were sunk near Panbaokang, and another was sunk off the coast of Shaping, drowning 50 to 60 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army abandoned dozens of corpses on the shore of Shaping, and the Chinese army seized many spoils of war. That evening, the Japanese troops retreated completely back to Jiujiang.

While the Japanese army attempted to attack Heshan and Gaoming again, they also increased their troops in Daliang and other places in Shunde, attempting to invade Zhongshan County. In recent days, more than 30 motorboats have been seen in Rongqi and Guizhou, which belong to Shunde, and Toushan, Yinggezui, and the river surface connected to Zhongshan. Jiuzhou Island on the Zhongshan sea has been occupied by the Japanese army as a supply station. Near Sanzao Island, seven Japanese shallow-water warships have been seen cruising back and forth. On the 12th, they sent marines to land at Hengmen Yongkoumen in Zhongshan, but they were repelled by the Chinese army. On the same day, Xiaohuangpu in the county was also harassed by the Japanese army, and all the local food and hardware were plundered. At night, they fled back to Zhou, which belongs to Shunde. On the 11th, it was also reported that a Japanese plainclothes team was discovered in Nanping Township, the fifth district of the county, but it was fortunately detected and suppressed by the authorities in advance. After the unrest in the above-mentioned areas, the entire county was filled with panic. The county government immediately issued an emergency order to destroy the western section of the highway from Shiqi to Macau. On the 13th, an order was issued again to evacuate the population. For a time, refugees crowded the Qiguan Station, and those going from Qianshan to Macau were endless. Wu Fei, a member of the provincial government, was ordered to arrive in Zhongshan to set up the Sixth Guerrilla Zone. Wu has already taken office as the commander of the Sixth Guerrilla Zone yesterday and convened a county-wide military and political meeting on the 13th to determine a major plan for resisting the war and defending oneself. He then personally went to inspect the defenses of various districts to ensure everything was safe. (May 11th)

### Xuzhou: Puppet Troops Revolt, Three Hundred Men Vow to Resist Japan

Xuzhou dispatch: Chen Kang, the commander of the puppet army in Xuzhou, was originally a former subordinate of Wu Peifu. The news that the Japanese army had previously agreed to Wu's establishment of a puppet government prompted Chen to take on the puppet post. Recently, Chen has learned that not only has Wu not established a puppet government, but he has also been unmoved by the Japanese army's threats and inducements. Chen, realizing that he had been deceived by the Japanese army, recently tried to resign from his post as commander of the puppet army and disbanded his only puppet army of 300 men. However, the Japanese secret service took over the puppet army and put it under its jurisdiction. Recently, with the guerrilla forces active in the southern part of Xuzhou, the Japanese army drove the puppet army to carry out "mopping up" missions in the three ports of Cao Village in southern Xuzhou. The leader of the local people's self-defense corps, Teng Caihua, used political tactics to make the puppet army revolt and jointly resist the enemy. The puppet army now understands its past mistakes and is willing to jointly resist Japan under Teng's guidance. The reorganization has been completed, and the unit is now strengthening its efforts to strike at the puppet organizations and actively mobilize the masses to sabotage the Jinpu Railway and other highways. The Japanese army's insidious policy of using Chinese to control Chinese has suffered another small setback here.

### Two Young Tennis Stars from the Philippines Perform Yesterday and Win All Matches; Sanchez Defeats Carson, Anbon Defeats Li Guofan

Philippine Davis Cup players Sanchez and Anbon traveled from the Philippines to the United States to participate in the Davis Cup. Yesterday afternoon, they passed through the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club and were specially invited to give a performance match, totaling three singles and doubles matches, held at the hard court of the French Chamber of Commerce. Five to six hundred Chinese and Western spectators watched, and the Philippine players won all three singles and doubles matches. Although the two had no special or advanced skills, they are young and promising. In particular, Sanchez's victory over Carson was remarkable. The two took the original round boat, Pias, to Japan and then to the United States this morning. The performance results yesterday are as follows:

Young, Strong, and Skillful

The two are unremarkable in appearance. Anbon is especially thin and small like a child, and it was thought that he was no match for Li Guofan. However, his physical strength is excellent, and his shots are steady. Li's failure was due to his lack of physical strength and stability. In the first few games, they were able to exchange shots, but later Li was exhausted and completely panicked, repeatedly touching the net and flying wildly. Anbon exchanged shots at both corners and volleyed, and was still calm after the match. After three to three in the first set, Li declined sharply, and the situation suddenly changed. Li scored in the second game of the second set. In the match between Sanchez and Carson, Carson dominated the entire court and won 6-2 very easily, but Carson was already showing signs of fatigue in the first set, and his running was not agile. This was probably because the season had just begun. In terms of skill, Carson was better than Sanchez. His volleys and chops were not as good as Carson's, but he was ultimately defeated by the rising young man. Carson gave up in the first set. Sanchez became more and more courageous in the third set. His forehand exchanges were indeed excellent. Carson was already unable to hit the ball with strength, and was only barely able to cope. After Sanchez led 4-1, Carson barely chased to make 4-4. In the tenth game, Sanchez fell to the ground to save the ball, losing the decisive point. Carson chased again to 5-5, and then took the lead at 6-5, but ultimately could not resist Sanchez's fierce shots and lost three consecutive games. In the final doubles match, Carson was already uninterested in fighting. There were not many wonderful shots from Squia. The two Philippine youths were still full of energy. Sanchez's style is quite similar to Qiu Feihai. His forehand is very good, but his hand is weak and he has not developed his other strengths. Both of them are young and will be rising stars in the East in the future.

Education News

### Overview of Secondary Education in China (3)

Rewarding Graduation Exams, Focusing on Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry

In the 27th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education stipulated that the curriculum outline for national secondary schools was not only for the use of national secondary schools, but also applicable to all public and private secondary schools across the country. It ordered various educational departments to formulate implementation measures and instruct all secondary schools to refer to them for implementation. This outline included five items: spiritual training, academic training, physical training, productive labor training, special education, and wartime rear service training. It aimed to add special education to normal education to meet the needs. In August of the same year, it also ordered all secondary schools to increase the teaching hours for music and art courses in junior and senior high schools. These two courses were each two hours per week in junior high school and one hour per week in senior high school to stimulate the spirit of resistance and awaken national consciousness.

In March of this year, the National Education Association decided on various cases of the secondary school curriculum: (1) Junior high school English may be changed to an elective course, and Chinese language, history, geography, labor (mainly housework for girls), or simple vocational courses should be added. (2) History and geography courses should be combined, and local history should account for one-third.

Equipment

Since the promulgation of the formal curriculum standards for junior and senior high schools, the Ministry of Education hired experts to compile standards for science equipment in secondary schools. In the 23rd year of the Republic, it announced the equipment standards for physics and chemistry in junior and senior high schools. In July, it announced the equipment standards for junior high school botany and zoology and senior high school biology, detailing the minimum, maximum, and general standards for the equipment of instruments, medicines, and specimens, as well as the estimated prices of the equipment. In the 25th year of the Republic, it also announced the equipment standards for the industrial arts part of the labor course in junior high schools, detailing the tools and materials needed for gold, wood, bamboo, rattan, soil, and other crafts. In the 24th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board, and the Chinese Cultural Foundation Committee jointly allocated funds and entrusted the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica to manufacture 100 sets of domestically produced physics instruments for senior high schools, which were distributed to high schools in various regions at half the price of 300 yuan per set. In the 25th year of the Republic, it was entrusted to the Institute of Physics to continue manufacturing 80 sets of physics instruments for senior high schools, 2,000 sets of physics instruments for junior high schools, 180 sets of chemistry instruments for senior high schools, and 660 sets of chemistry instruments for junior high schools, totaling 200,000 yuan. It was not completed until the end of the 27th year of the Republic. Due to the inconvenience of transportation during the war, they could not be fully allocated to schools, and most of them were stored by the institute, which would be adjusted and distributed later. After that, the institute was still entrusted to continue manufacturing, but on the one hand, it planned to raise funds to set up a factory in a suitable location in the southwest to manufacture domestically produced instruments to enrich the science equipment of secondary schools across the country and increase the efficiency of education.

Graduation Exams

The regulations on the graduation exams for public and private primary and secondary schools in the 21st year of the Republic stipulated the subjects and methods, ordering that students from secondary schools who did not pass the entrance exam would not be allowed to register for universities. Various provinces and cities held entrance exams. In the 22nd year of the Republic, the primary school graduation exam was abolished, and the secondary school graduation exam regulations were promulgated, abolishing the school graduation exam to reduce the number of exams in the last semester. There were better revisions to the scoring, calculation of grades, and announcement of the names of passing students, and the secondary school graduation exam committee regulations were promulgated to strictly organize the committee. In the 24th year of the Republic, the regulations were revised and promulgated, and the number of entrance exam subjects was appropriately reduced. The method of calculating the grades of each subject of the graduation exam was determined, and the grades of each subject of the school were also included in the calculation, accounting for 40%, and the entrance exam grades accounted for 60%. In the 25th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education reissued a notice to change the entrance exam subjects and stipulated: (1) The ranking of each student should be arranged according to the total average of their graduation grades in each subject. The calculation method of this total average is the sum of the grades of each subject in the entrance exam and the grades of each subject outside the entrance exam, divided by the sum of the number of subjects in the entrance exam and the number of subjects outside the entrance exam. (2) Only the list of schools participating in the entrance exam needs to be published, and the school grades do not need to be calculated according to student grades. (3) The junior high school entrance exam in each province and city may be held in more places than before. (4) The conduct and physical education grades of the school must also be strictly assessed, and they must not be allowed to participate in the entrance exam simply because their academic grades are still passable. In the summer of the 27th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education, due to the spread of the war, found it difficult for various provinces to hold entrance exams, and stipulated the entrance exam method. All provinces that have become war zones are temporarily exempt from holding entrance exams. The provinces near the war zones will have members of the Education Department sent to the schools to supervise the exams, while the provinces in the rear will still hold entrance exams. In the 28th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education, in accordance with the Scholarship Regulations for Chairman Lin's 70th Birthday, used cash to reward the students in each province who achieved excellent results in mathematics, physics, and chemistry in the graduation exams, one student in each subject, and the top two students with excellent average grades in order to encourage them.

### The Connection Between Law and Economics

— Qiu Ying

In modern times, humanity relies on economic strength to build wealthy and powerful nations and prosperous markets. While this is partly due to natural trends, it also depends on the completeness of the law, which has led to this rapid progress. If a nation's economic structure lacks legal support, it is like a rudderless ship, unable to navigate and reach its destination. Conversely, if the law is divorced from economics, there is no need for its creation. They are mutually causative and resultant, and the two contain inseparable and complex functions.

European and American economies have long embarked on the path of capitalism. To this day, they have reached their peak. Therefore, European and American countries, purely to cooperate with this economic system, have created many property laws and property protection laws to seek trade security and asset development. To follow the trend, our country must catch up and strive for self-renewal. However, due to various factors, the economic aspect is limited to coastal trading ports and a few cities, which have a roughly a structure, but are also biased towards consumption. As for production, it is still in its infancy. Other towns and villages still maintain our country's inherent way of life, with no modern economy to speak of.

Understanding this, one must know that although our country's civil and commercial laws are modeled after Europe and the United States, our country's economy is far behind them. Therefore, when put into practice, it is inevitable that there will be ridicule of a "maidservant imitating her mistress," and there is also the risk of focusing on one thing and losing sight of the other. This is because our country is under the oppression of foreign economies, and its foundation is exceptionally weak. Although there are emerging industries, they are just entering the front door of capitalism and have not yet been fully integrated. If the content of the law is too capitalistic, the welfare of the working masses will inevitably be completely exploited and will become increasingly impoverished, which is a hidden worry for our country. For example, the "rent increase problem" worried about by Mr. Yu Zhongluo and Mr. Zong Meng's "malpractice of imbalance between emotion and law" are all related to the livelihood of Shanghai's people. Although the current situation in Shanghai is unique due to the increasing number of residents who have come to Shanghai to escape the war, it is still different from the usual situation. However, the housing problem of the poor, when faced with the oppression of landlords, cannot be legally resolved, which shows that the factors of mismatch between law and economics have been fully manifested. It should be known that in European and American countries, the high price of housing is due to the development of industry and commerce, the gathering of political population, and the rise in living standards. However, the residents of Shanghai come here to escape the war, not only are they short of funds, but they are also mostly unemployed and have no access to loans. Their daily life is more difficult than usual, and their eyes are all falling. And the rich in general only care about their own interests, and they all use capitalistic laws to attack the poor. Although it concerns morality, it is also justifiable. In terms of human feelings, who would be willing to generously give up their own interests to be such a foolish fool who reverses the benefits? The so-called special environment of Shanghai can be said to be all special. On the one hand, the poor commit suicide, and on the other hand, second-hand tenants still oppress third-hand tenants, and other aspects of unscrupulous merchants still hoard and raise rice prices. Gold is the root of all evil, and it has exhausted the cruelty of the world—. Now, Mr. Yu Zhongluo wants to use social opinion to condemn the rich for their unrighteousness. Although this can alleviate the deficiencies of the law, it still depends on their character, and only good people can endure the end of their words. Otherwise, they will act perversely and stubbornly, and it will be difficult to subtly change them. Now, to treat the symptoms in an emergency, it is better to appeal to the authorities. If they can quickly promulgate a relief law to protect the lives of the general poor, and on the other hand, they must also rely on wise judges to consider the general economy in each case. It would be a great blessing if the majority of the poor were not suffocated by the difficulties of life.

Furthermore, the general public should be able to organize themselves with a sense of the masses to promote the modernization of the law. In order to improve the economy with "nation-building," complete the legal structure of the entire people. In general, there should be no defects, and it should also be able to conform to the principles of human feelings and benefit the people's livelihood. It is not far away. However, is it evil or not? I hope the legislative authorities will pay attention to it.

### Mediation of Cases Should Not Lose the Spirit of Summary Procedure

— Xu Zuoliang

After reading Mr. Qu Yue's article in last week's issue on how to make mediation effective, regarding the hope that the court will improve the mediation methods, it is both thorough and detailed. I think there is still something to add, that is, when mediation cases proceed to litigation, they should not lose the spirit of summary procedure. According to the Civil Procedure Law, there are provisions for summary procedure and non-summary procedure (i.e., local cases). For non-summary cases, the delivery of summons for the date of oral argument should be at least ten days, and the trial period (Article 251 of the Civil Procedure Law) for summary cases is shortened to five days, and the facts and reasons in the judgment can only be recorded in essence (Articles 427 and 432 of the Civil Procedure Law), which is sufficient to show the legislative intent. Summary cases strive for quick and easy conclusion of cases to benefit the litigants. As for the provisions on requesting the court to mediate before filing a lawsuit (Article 409 of the Civil Procedure Law), its purpose is also to be quick and easy, so the mediation establishment has the same effect as settlement in litigation (Article 421 of the Civil Procedure Law), and it is not considered more solemn than local cases. Local cases do not need to go through mediation, while summary cases must go through this mandatory mediation. Moreover, according to Article 409, Paragraph 1, Item 5 of the Civil Procedure Law, if the nature of the legal relationship and the circumstances of the parties concerned can be considered that there is no hope of mediation, a lawsuit may be filed directly without mediation. Also, according to Article 419 of the Civil Procedure Law, if both parties in the mediation are present and the mediation fails, the argument for litigation may be made at the request of one party, especially for mediation cases. Although the court must mediate, under special circumstances, it is still possible not to apply for mediation, and if both parties are present and the mediation fails, the argument for litigation may be made immediately, which is more significant that the spirit of quick conclusion of summary procedure is not lost. Now, the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, for summary cases, does not ask whether the parties have declared that there is no hope of mediation due to special circumstances, and directly files a lawsuit, and the court forcibly mediates all cases. The applicant who is present will be ordered to pay an additional mediation application fee of one yuan and five cents. (Applicants who are not present can be spared) If the mediation fails, the court will re-file the case and set a date for trial. By the time of judgment and execution, calculating the period, it takes two weeks from the filing of the lawsuit to the trial mediation. From the failure of the mediation to the filing of the case for trial, it often takes a month. From the delivery of the judgment to the final execution, it takes two months. Generally, for a summary case, from the filing of the lawsuit to the execution, it often takes more than three or four months (referring to those who have been confirmed in the first instance), which is more complicated than the conclusion of a local case. According to the reason, the court of the first special court applies the mandatory provisions of Article 409 of the Civil Procedure Law to the mediation of summary cases. However, the court of the first special court does not apply the provisions of Article 409, Paragraph 1, Item 5 and Article 419 of the Civil Procedure Law regarding the points that a lawsuit may be filed directly without mediation and that both parties present may make an argument for litigation. As a result, the complexity and speed of the case are actually opposite to the result of local cases, as if they have exchanged positions. Is this something that the original legislative intent could have predicted? Insiders said that the reason why the second special court must forcibly mediate all cases, regardless of whether the parties have applied for hope of mediation, is that the court's legal income is less, so it has to resort to this to seek relief. As for not allowing the two parties to argue for litigation, it is because the judges handling the mediation and the judges handling the litigation are divided into two groups, so another case must be filed. However, this is not without a way to correct it. If it is for mandatory mediation due to legal income, the court may order the receiving office to collect an additional mediation application fee of one yuan and five cents at the time of filing the lawsuit for those who file a lawsuit directly without mediation, and allocate the mediation and litigation trial together. The same judge will handle them separately at the same time. As for when the two parties are present, if one party applies for an argument for litigation, the judge handling the case may directly handle the litigation trial. If it is considered that there is a time relationship for the trial, it may be possible to increase the number of court clerks and reduce the number of cases to provide relief. If so, in summary cases, the spirit of summary procedure will not be lost, and the provisions of Article 409, Paragraph 1, Item 5 and Article 419 of the Civil Procedure Law will not be deliberately omitted and not applied again. This is what I hope that the authorities will improve and correct.

Summary of Judgments

(Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court)

When the court's verification of handwriting is sufficient for a judgment, it shall base its judgment on its own discretion, and it shall not be deemed inappropriate even if the appraisal procedure is not implemented. (Hu Shangzi No. 108 of the 27th Year of the Republic of China)

1. If the appeal petition does not state the reasons for the appeal, the appellant shall submit a statement of reasons to the original first-instance court within fifteen days after filing the appeal. If the appellant fails to submit the statement of reasons, the court need not order the appellant to correct it. 2. If the appellant has a lawyer as a litigation agent, or it can be recognized from the records on the petition that the appellant clearly knows that the requirements for the appeal are lacking, the court shall not follow the procedures of Article 439, Paragraph 2 and Article 441, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Procedure Law. (Hu Shangzi No. 109 of the 27th Year of the Republic of China)

A party who discovers evidence that has not been considered or who can use the evidence may file a complaint against the final judgment if the consideration of the evidence may result in a more favorable judgment. However, the so-called evidence refers to evidence that already existed before the conclusion of the oral argument in the first-instance trial of the previous proceeding. (Hu Shangzi No. 115 of the 27th Year of the Republic of China)

Legal News

### Execution Does Not Extend to the Property of the Legal Representative

The Shandong High Court submitted a request for interpretation regarding the litigation costs of Teng County. The Judicial Yuan issued Instruction No. 1842 (February 3, 28th Year of the Republic of China), stating: "For the judgment of loss of a lawsuit brought by parents for their minor children to terminate a marriage engagement with others, the execution of the litigation costs may be carried out against the parents only if the parents are the parties to the lawsuit listed in the judgment. If they are only listed as legal representatives, the execution shall not be carried out against the property of the legal representatives regardless of whether their children have private property."

### Method of Calculating Appeal Benefits

The Jiangsu High Court submitted a request for interpretation regarding the method of calculating appeal benefits for disputes over easement rights. The Judicial Yuan issued Instruction No. 1830 (December 31, 27th Year of the Republic of China), stating: "When filing an appeal due to an easement right lawsuit, regardless of whether the appellant is the easement right holder or the owner of the serving land, and regardless of the claims of the opposing party, the calculation of the appeal benefits shall be based on the amount of the increase in the value of the dominant land due to the assertion of the easement right by one party or the amount of the reduction in the value of the serving land due to the denial of the easement right. Also, for a lawsuit in which the plaintiff requests the defendant to return the land and demolish the buildings on the land or cut down the trees, regardless of which party files the appeal, the standard for calculating the appeal benefits shall be based on the active or passive benefits obtained by winning the lawsuit according to the portion of the judgment that is requested to be changed."

Legal Questions

(Question) A has a daughter who, at the age of three, was adopted by C through the introduction of B. After A died, C and the daughter agreed not to interact with A's family. Can they be approached to negotiate? (Hansheng)

(Answer) Since A's daughter has been adopted by C, she no longer has kinship with A's family and cannot be forced to interact with them. (Feng Meixue)

(Question) The divorce document states that the child is to be raised by the woman, and it is noted that education and other expenses are included in the alimony. Is the man's responsibility over? What can I do if I don't want this child? (Lu Renjie)

(Answer) Since there is an agreement between the parties, it should be handled in accordance with the agreement. However, there is a blood relationship between father and son, which cannot be severed by law. If one party cannot maintain a livelihood and has no ability to earn a living, the other party shall still be responsible for support. (Feng Meixue)

(Question) A certain lady lost her parents early and was betrothed by her relatives, but without the lady's permission. Is it legally valid? (Luo Xin)

(Answer) It is legally invalid. However, this is not the case if the lady ratifies it. (Feng Meixue)

(Question) A borrowed 5,000 yuan from B in the 25th year of the Republic of China, using land and houses in the concession as collateral, and there was a written pledge stating "the term is two years, if it is not repaid upon expiration, let someone (i.e., B) sell it by auction, without going through court procedures." Now that A has not repaid it upon expiration, can B sell it by auction after publishing it in the newspaper? Is this kind of special agreement valid? (Ding Yu)

(Answer) It is not legal to publish and sell it by auction on your own. You can only apply to the court for auction. (Yi)

(Question) A is from Jiangsu. More than ten years ago, because of disagreement with his wife, he came to Shanghai in anger and said that he would never return to Jiangsu, but the relationship between father and son has not broken down. After the August 13th Incident, A lost his job and his life became increasingly difficult. He borrowed 100 yuan from B, which has not been repaid. Recently, he wanted to return to Jiangsu, but his wife firmly refused. Although his son interceded, it was also ineffective. Recently, A was reported missing, then (1) Can the debt owed to B be demanded from his son? (2) Because of kinship, no interest is calculated, and there is no written note or witness. Can his son refuse to acknowledge it? (3) If his son denies it, what is the appropriate way to deal with it? (Cao Weiqing)

(Answer) Although A was reported missing, before he is declared dead in accordance with the law and his son inherits, the son is not responsible for repaying his father's debt. As for the loan without a written note or witness, it is not invalid, but when there is a dispute over the truth of the facts, the creditor should prove the truth of his claim, otherwise it is difficult to recognize that his claim exists. (Tong)

Answer to Mr. Sun Jilong The questions in your letter are without standards, so it is impossible to answer them. It is better to read more publications about legal knowledge and discuss with those who are familiar with the law when things happen. (Editor)

Brief Remarks

### Different Interpretations of Good and Evil

— (Yuan Yong)

What is called good? What is called evil? Everyone understands. However, good faith and bad faith in law are not explained in this way. If you don't know the circumstances, it is called good faith, and if you deliberately do something, it is called bad faith. The two words good and evil are also very clear. However, there are now very many distorted principles. Clearly an invasion is said to maintain a certain new order, and clearly a massacre is said to be unseen and unknown. Alas—good is what is good, and evil is what is evil. Is there still right and wrong in the world?

Research and Criticism

### Victims in Private Prosecution Procedures

— Yu Zhongluo

Article 337 of the old Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates that the victim may file a private prosecution directly with the court with jurisdiction, and Article 311 of the new Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that the victim may file a private prosecution, both show that the subject of the right of private prosecution is the victim of the crime. However, the old law did not set a restriction that the victim must have the capacity to act, while the new law is attached with a proviso. Therefore, according to the result of comparative interpretation, if the victim of the old law is a person without the capacity to act, or a person with limited capacity to act, the exercise of the right of private prosecution may be carried out by his legal representative. (That is, the legal representative acts as the plaintiff in the name of the victim, and the legal representative conducts the litigation act.) If the victim of the new law does not have the capacity to act, he is not recognized as the subject of the right of private prosecution, and therefore there is no legal representative who can file a private prosecution on his behalf. Also, according to the illustration of Article 338 of the Bu Law, in addition to the victim, the following persons may be the plaintiff in a private prosecution:

1. Legal representatives, guardians, and spouses of the victim.

2. Relatives of the victim. Those who have the status of (1) file a private prosecution in their own name and are not bound by the wishes of the victim, which is called an independent private prosecution. Those who have the status of (2) may file a private prosecution only after the victim has died, but may not violate the express wishes of the victim. Exploring the legislative intent, it is appropriate to allow those who have the status of (1) to independently file a prosecution in the original public prosecution (Article 214, Paragraph 1 of the old law), and it is also appropriate to allow them to independently file a private prosecution in the private prosecution. Those who have the status of (2) are allowed to file a prosecution after the victim has died, without violating the express wishes of the victim, which is also a provision that corresponds to Article 214, Paragraph 2 of the old law. All of them seek to protect the interests of the victim in a thorough manner. The new law is said to expand the scope of private prosecution, but it strictly restricts the subject of the right of private prosecution, which must be exercised by the victim who has the capacity to act. It not only does not allow the legal representative to file a private prosecution on his behalf, but also deletes the provisions of the old law on independent private prosecution and the private prosecution filed by relatives after the victim's death without violating his express wishes. Therefore, even if it is a crime that is prosecuted upon complaint, if the victim does not have the capacity to act in civil law, his legal representative cannot file a private prosecution, and he must file a complaint in accordance with the public prosecution procedure before he can be investigated and prosecuted by the prosecutor. The scope of private prosecution has been relaxed, but the opportunity for victims to use the private prosecution procedure for protection is narrower than in the old law. Isn't it a contradiction for the legislator to say that restricting people other than the victim from filing a private prosecution is to prevent the abuse of fraud and extortion? Then why does the public prosecution procedure still set up independent prosecution and the provisions for allowing those who file a prosecution after the victim's death? The spirit of the legislator is not consistent, which is especially obvious.

What is described above is only the victim of a natural person. Furthermore, when it comes to legal persons, although Article 26 of the current Civil Law states that they have the capacity to enjoy rights and bear obligations within the restrictions of laws and regulations, it does not expressly state that they have the capacity to act. The Code of Criminal Procedure does not have the same provision as the Code of Civil Procedure that "those who can independently bear obligations for legal acts have the capacity to litigate," so it is not recognized that legal persons have the capacity to act. If they do not have the capacity to act, then when a legal person is a victim due to a crime, it should be restricted by the proviso of Article 311 of the new Code of Criminal Procedure, and they should not be allowed to file a private prosecution. Also, because the new law does not have the same provision as the old law for the legal representative to independently file a private prosecution, the representative of the legal person should also be interpreted as having no right to file a private prosecution. However, the so-called victim in Article 311 of the new Code of Criminal Procedure will be limited to natural persons. However, the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan is to expressly state that when a legal person is a victim, its representative may file a private prosecution, and it still maintains the meaning of "the plaintiff in a private prosecution is limited to a natural person or a legal person" when it was applied in the old Code of Criminal Procedure, or it also feels that the restriction of the new law is inappropriate, and it has to use this judicial interpretation to try to save it in application? The number and date of the new and old interpretations of this problem are attached below for reference.

### How Does the Happiness of Married Life Affect the Body and Mind?

Many men and women have changed completely after marriage. This change naturally has both good and bad aspects: In the good aspects, for example, a lazy man before marriage will become very diligent and thrifty after marriage, and those who are physically weak will also become healthy. In the bad aspects, there are often young people who were handsome and enterprising before marriage, but suddenly become decadent after marriage, and those who are strong become weak, and even find various morbidities in their body and mind, which can be completely different from before. What is the reason for this? It is the result of the influence of married life on the body and mind.

Happiness is the food of our spirit, which is enough to encourage us to move forward. Health is the power of our body, which supports our work all day long. However, a sound mind resides in a sound body, and the two are closely related and inseparable.

A vigorous and healthy man marries a satisfactory wife, or a beautiful and graceful girl marries a satisfactory husband. They will inevitably live a happy life in the atmosphere of love, giving birth to sons and daughters, and forming a happy family. Because the body and mind are mutually comforted, mutually considerate, and mutually cherished, health will inevitably improve, the spirit will be happy, and the future will be full of optimism. Optimism leads to progress, and progress leads to success. However, if a husband suffers from premature ejaculation, impotence, spermatorrhea, underdevelopment, thin sperm, infertility, neurasthenia, etc., or marries a wife who is breastless, has a sallow complexion, and has irregular menstruation, their married life will not be coordinated and reach perfection. We know that the satisfaction of sexual life between couples is the only element that maintains their love. Imagine a beautiful girl marrying a sick husband, then the married life will not be perfect, and the precious years will be wasted, which is how painful it is for her! Because of her dissatisfaction and unhappiness, various tragedies are staged in the family! In the end, the weak husband or the weak wife will inevitably suffer the consequences! Therefore, if you want to seek the perfection of married life, good health is the only important thing. However, for husbands who have already suffered from the above-mentioned morbidities, it is not difficult to seek remedy in today's world of medical advancement. The only treatment is to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish nerves, and promote the development of function and vigorous metabolism. The above-mentioned symptoms can be cured fundamentally. If you continue to take it, you can also achieve the effect of prolonging life, reversing aging and returning to youth. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Himitoto's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" (available at Wuzhou Pharmacy) to consolidate the sperm barrier and prevent spermatorrhea. By using both the treatment of symptoms and the treatment of root causes, the effect will be more rapid. According to the millions of cases of famous doctors in the world and my many years of experience at home and abroad, it is recognized that this method is the most effective for the treatment of the above-mentioned symptoms, so I dare to introduce it to the patients. I hope that you will appreciate this hard work!

Beauty

### The Sorrow of Shrivelled Breasts!

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Recently, Ms. Shen from the Beishijiazhai of Dunxin Road wrote to say that her body was not very strong, and because she often wore small vests during development, a pair of breasts in front of her chest were not fully developed and perfect. Although they are not necessarily flat, they only have two small and slightly protruding prototypes. It is impossible to talk about being high and elastic, so after she got married, although her face was still quite beautiful, she could not win her husband's favor. Recently, three months ago, due to miscarriage and ill health, the breasts that were not very high were even more shrivelled. They are as flat as a man's, so her husband became even more indifferent to her, and sometimes he did not return home all night. She repeatedly advised him gently, but her husband turned a deaf ear. She reasoned with him sternly. He was more fierce than her! She said how affectionate other people's husbands were to their wives? He said why other people's women were all full-breasted and plump-hipped, and their flesh was touching. Why are you shrivelled and ugly, and have nothing touching. She was so angry that she could not answer, and she washed her face with tears every day, complaining about herself! A few days ago, she happened to see modern medicine at the home of her former classmate Ms. Song Qi, and she wrote to the editor of this journal to inquire about remedies.

There are naturally too many things like this in today's society, but this kind of defect is not irreparable. According to the experience of world-renowned gynecologists and others, it is universally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation "Reproductive Hormone" for women is the most effective for the symptoms. The main reason for the shrivelled breasts is the dysfunction of the reproductive gland, the ovary. Taking the "Reproductive Hormone" for women prepared with the essence of the ovaries of young animals will naturally have a significant effect in a short period of time. If you continue to take it, not only can it make the shrivelled breasts higher day by day, but it can also regulate menstruation, eliminate uterine diseases, promote metabolism, increase vitality, make the face ruddy, and maintain youth.

### The Crisis of Nocturnal Emission in Scorching Summer

— By Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Although it is only early summer now, scorching summer will arrive in an instant. When the fiery sun hangs high and the heat is steaming, if one suffers from nocturnal emission, not only will the symptoms worsen, and the number of nocturnal emissions increase, but it may even lead to spermatorrhea and semen leakage if left untreated. Therefore, if nocturnal emission can be thoroughly treated in early summer, not only will less vital energy be lost in the body, but treatment will also be easier. This is truly a worthwhile approach.

The essence in our human body is the source of our life. Not only does it control the development of our appearance and weight, but it can also regulate metabolism and nourish the nerves of various parts of the body. If excessive seminal fluid is lost due to nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, or semen leakage, symptoms such as brain fatigue, forgetfulness, insomnia, anxiety, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, and mental fatigue will follow. At the same time, developmental functions stagnate, and metabolism decreases, leading to unattractive appearance, local underdevelopment, sallow complexion, emaciation, and premature aging. If such men are in the scorching summer, they often suffer from brain distension and headaches. How can students manage to take supplementary lessons during the summer vacation? Similarly, young people in the workforce are overwhelmed by work every day, simply unable to cope. If things go wrong, some may even succumb to illness during the summer and autumn when epidemics are rampant, which is not uncommon. In short, the future of such young people is bleak, and their happiness is lost! To seek remedy, the disease must be treated fundamentally. The most reliable and effective treatment for nocturnal emission at this time is to take "Hemi-Todes' Sperm-Solidifying Pills". This medicine can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, reduce nocturnal dreams, and promote restful sleep, thereby curing nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, it is necessary to also take the gonadotropin preparation "Gonadotropin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish the nerves, promote developmental functions, and invigorate metabolism. Then the above-mentioned symptoms will surely disappear completely in a short period of time, and the body can become healthier, achieving the effect of prolonging life. If patients can personally come to our clinic for diagnosis by a specialist doctor, and then use electrotherapy, injections, surgery, and other symptomatic treatments, a cure can be guaranteed.

Clinic: Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road

Free Consultation, Only $0.40 Registration Fee

### Why Does Gonorrhea Tend to Recur?

Experienced clinicians will strive to completely cure patients suffering from gonorrhea, and will never abandon their sacred responsibility midway. They will not use aggressive drugs, clumsy surgery, or improper treatments to forcibly suppress the condition, which may lead to future problems.

For example, during the acute stage of gonorrhea, some doctors, in order to gain the patient's trust, may use strong washing methods or aggressive drugs. As a result, the discharge of pus temporarily stops, the urine becomes clear, or only two or three drops of discharge are seen during urination. At this time, the doctor often tells the patient that the disease is completely cured and no further treatment is needed. However, many patients often relapse within a few days of returning home. It should be understood that the pathogens of gonorrhea not only multiply on the entire surface of the mucous membrane, but also often penetrate deep into the mucous membrane or spread to adjacent accessory organs, where they re-establish foci of infection. Therefore, even if strong washing medicines are used and the surface symptoms of the mucous membrane are luckily cured, the adjacent accessory organs will relapse. It should be understood that the presence of gonorrhea in the urine indicates that it is not completely cured. Even if the urine appears clear to the naked eye, it cannot be determined that it is cured.

To avoid the above-mentioned drawbacks, only the combined use of German Filtrin Direct Current Electrotherapy and ultra-specialized chemical therapy can rapidly eliminate gonorrhea. Filtrin Direct Current Electrotherapy has a broad and deep powerful bactericidal effect and can clarify its toxins. Combined with ultra-specialized therapy and agile, painless surgery, the bactericidal power will be thorough and the toxins will be clarified. In that case, once cured, there will be no recurrence.

### Japanese Perceptions of Measures in the Concession: Several Different Feelings, New Developments Expected After Miura's Return to Shanghai, Japan and Jewish Aiming to Establish Peace as a Slogan

Embassy Expresses Approval

The Continental Daily News reports that the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy, when meeting with reporters yesterday (the 20th), fully agreed with the actions taken by the Public Works Bureau last week to deal with anti-Japanese instigators. He referred to the announcement of the ban on political groups, the order for a general search on Thursday evening and Friday morning, and the actions taken against foreign-owned Chinese newspapers as "steps in the right direction." However, the spokesman indicated that matters had not yet completely satisfied the Japanese side. He stated, "We are far from completely satisfied, but we recognize these steps as expressions of the Public Works Bureau's goodwill in meeting Japanese demands." The Japanese military spokesman added that the Japanese Army authorities were also pleased. The Embassy spokesman continued that several issues, including the issue of Chinese flags in the county and court disputes, remained to be resolved.

Japanese Reporter Deems Anti-Japanese

The China Press reports that, according to a Tokyo dispatch from the Toho News Agency, the Shanghai correspondent of the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun telegraphed Tokyo on the 20th of this month, stating that Japanese officials in Shanghai increasingly believe that Japan will be forced to take unilateral action to implement its policies in the International Settlement. The correspondent predicted that the situation would undergo new developments after the return of Japanese Consul General Miura to Shanghai. Miura is currently in Tokyo, discussing everything with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and is expected to return to Shanghai on the 27th of this month. The correspondent also stated that the mobilization of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Public Works Bureau police force on Friday, ostensibly to curb terrorism, was in fact a form of anti-Japanese demonstration. This situation, coupled with the rejection by Britain and the United States of Japan's proposals to amend the regulations governing land in the International Settlement, makes it feel that it is extremely difficult to achieve the reorganization of the Public Works Bureau through diplomatic means.

Miura States Establishing Peace According to the China Press, a special Tokyo correspondent's airmail letter was also published yesterday, recounting a conversation with Kawai, spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Kawai elaborated on the need to reorganize the Public Works Bureau to adapt to the new needs of today in order to ensure the smooth operation of the administrative organs of the International Settlement. His writing was lengthy and largely similar to the Japanese government's statements to British Ambassador to Tokyo, Sir Robert Craigie, and American Ambassador Grew, so it will not be repeated. In the letter, the correspondent also stated that Japanese Consul General Miura, currently in Japan, recently said to a person, "Some British and American expatriates in Shanghai seem to think that Japan will eventually use force to solve the settlement issue, but we are determined to establish lasting peace in the Far East. Therefore, the reorganization of the International Settlement should be implemented in accordance with this basic policy." Miura also mentioned the issue of the French Concession in Shanghai, saying that the solution to this problem is relatively easy, the most important thing being the courts in the French Concession. The problem with the French Concession only requires dealing with one country, while the International Settlement involves many countries, so it is more complicated.

### Hana Maru Liner Suspends Service in Shanghai, Shanghai-Dinghai and Ningbo-Dinghai Routes Resume Smoothly

After the resumption of the Shanghai-Ningbo route, there were problems with the Shanghai-Dinghai route, but the Ningbo-Dinghai route has been successfully resumed. A Datong News Agency reporter recorded the actual situation as follows:

Shanghai-Ningbo Route

After the Lihe Shipping Department's Moufu Wheel successfully sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo the day before yesterday, the Sino-Italian Consalia Wheel was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo yesterday. However, due to the bombing of Ningbo, stevedores loading and unloading goods at the dock have to return to the city to work at night, so the wheel was rescheduled to depart at 4:00 AM this morning, arriving in Ningbo by evening. The Deping Wheel has departed from Wenzhou and is en route to Shanghai, arriving today and departing for Ningbo tomorrow. If time is not sufficient, it will be postponed to the morning of the 24th.

Ningbo-Dinghai Route

After the Far East Hana Maru Liner and the Lu Lin Gaodeng Wheel successively sailed to Dinghai on the 19th, both wheels arrived in Dinghai on the morning of the 20th. The Hana Maru Liner left Dinghai at 4:00 PM yesterday, carrying passengers and cargo, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 AM today. The Gaodeng Wheel stayed in Dinghai for one day, and resumed service to Ningbo for the first time at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The journey was very smooth, and the ship arrived safely in Ningbo at 2:00 PM. The wheel is scheduled to depart from Ningbo to Dinghai again today, and will routinely operate on the Ningbo-Dinghai route from now on.

Shanghai-Dinghai Route

According to information received by the Datong News Agency reporter, the Hana Maru Liner will temporarily suspend service on the Shanghai-Dinghai route after returning to Shanghai from Dinghai. It is likely to be reassigned to Wenzhou. The wheel's authorities have not provided a reason for the suspension. Therefore, the resumption of shipping to Shanghai-Dinghai has been short lived and will apparently be suspended again. It is also rumored that the Taikoo New Beijing Wheel will sail to Ningbo today, but this is inaccurate, as the wheel is currently in Tianjin.

### Spring Cocoons Begin to Enter the Market, Shanghai Merchants Purchase Separately, Zhejiang Native Cocoons Suffer Poor Harvest, Estimated to Be About 30% Lower, Jiangzhe Improved Cocoons Expected to Be Better

Spring cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang have begun to enter the market. Cities within the occupied areas are controlled by the "Central China Company," while individual silk factories in Shanghai are free to purchase cocoons from various townships. Zhejiang native cocoons have suffered a poor harvest this year. Improved cocoons are about to enter the scene and are expected to be better. Shanghai factories will resume operations as soon as the new cocoons arrive. Details are as follows:

Shanghai Merchants Allowed to Purchase Cocoons in Townships

The "Central China Silk Company" originally intended to control the spring cocoons in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, prohibiting Shanghai silk factories from purchasing them. However, due to the guerrillas destroying the cocoon shops everywhere, the Company, realizing the difficulty of controlling cocoon shops in townships, and after strenuous efforts by Shanghai silk factories, agreed to abandon the control of cocoon shops in townships, allowing Shanghai factories to purchase freely. Shanghai factories are now going to various townships to set up shops for purchase, and have prepared certificates from the Shanghai Silk Manufacturers' Association. However, the cocoons purchased must be taxed to the "Renovation Government" before they are allowed to be transported to Shanghai.

Poor Native Harvest, Improved Cocoons are Still Good

Native cocoons from Hangzhou, Haining, Jiaxing, Deqing, and other counties in Zhejiang have been put on the market. The price in Hangzhou is 42 yuan (national currency) per dan (18 tael balance). The price of the best native cocoons in Changan, Haining is 45 yuan (national currency) per dan. However, due to weather conditions, the harvest of native cocoons in various counties of Zhejiang Province this year has been about 30% lower. As for the improved varieties, they will soon enter the scene and are expected to have a better harvest. Because the weather has been very good in recent days, it is suitable for improved varieties to form cocoons. It is said that improved varieties in Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, Danyang, and other places in Jiangsu are scheduled to appear on the market at the end of this month or early next month.

Shanghai Factories Waiting for Cocoons to Start Operations

There are approximately 45 silk factories in the Shanghai concession. Due to the lack of raw materials, they have been forced to stop work one after another. As of yesterday, only a few factories, such as Jardine, were barely maintaining operations. Regarding the purchase of cocoons from the occupied areas this year, although silver shops have stopped lending tortoise money and insurance companies have stopped insuring various risks, in order to avoid running out of raw materials, they still risk buying from the occupied areas. It has now been decided that operations will resume as soon as the new cocoons arrive in Shanghai, and it has been decided that day and night shifts will be worked to rush the silk reeling. It is expected that after the spring cocoons are put on the market, the number of silk factories in Shanghai will increase to more than 50.

Spring Cocoons from Eastern Zhejiang Approved for Shipment to Shanghai

Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Xinchang, Shengxian, Zhuji, and other counties in eastern Zhejiang are also the only cocoon-producing areas. They have now been fully put on the market and purchased by local factories and remaining cocoon merchants. The Zhejiang Provincial Local Bank and the Camellia Oil and Silk Management Office have allocated 1.5 million yuan to handle spring cocoon loans. It is said that the cocoons produced in the above counties are all native varieties. As for improved varieties, they are rarely hatched. The harvest this year is better than that in western Zhejiang. The Trade Commission originally intended to control their transportation and sale, but at the request of Shanghai factories, it has agreed to allow them to be transported to Shanghai by wheel from Ningbo.

### Small-Scale Silk Industry Forced to Close, Silk Raw Materials Under Control, Prices Increase by 10-20%

There are no less than 300 to 400 large and small electric weaving silk factories in this city. According to sources in the silk industry, due to the control of silk-producing areas, raw materials are scarce in Shanghai, resulting in a daily decrease in inventory and an increase in selling prices. Except for most small-scale electric factories in western Shanghai, which are limited by capital and unable to operate, and are forced to close, the prices of various silk fabrics produced by major electric weaving silk factories have increased by 10-20% due to the high cost of raw materials. As for sales to other ports, Yunnan, Guiyang, Sichuan, Kunming, and other places are the main destinations, but due to the high cost of shipping, the profits are quite low.

### Concession Authorities Strictly Investigate Rice Market Manipulation, Dispatch Personnel to Stations Every Morning for Investigation, Rice Industry Still Enforces Price Limits

Since the Rice Grain Evaluation Committee, due to the difficulty of its work, resolved to dissolve itself voluntarily, yesterday morning, the rice market transactions changed from private to public prices. In addition to finding ways to dredge sources of origin, the Bean and Rice Industry Association still maintained its previous stance on the issue of price limits and strictly enforced them. The concession authorities are determined to severely crack down on hoarding households for speculation and manipulation and will punish them. Grain firms that handle entrepot grain secretly ordered foreign rice. Details of each situation are recorded as follows:

Private Trade Becomes Public Market Price

The Shanghai rice industry market has been manipulated by speculators with financial resources, resulting in a sharp rise in market prices. In addition to the 15 yuan price limit, private trading has increased by 2 to 3 yuan. Only because the buying and selling parties secretly transact, enforcement is very difficult, and the work of the evaluation committee has been severely hindered, so it was resolved to dissolve it. After the market opened at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the buying and selling parties were like drunkards, trading in large quantities at the original private market price, which has changed to open bidding. The highest white rice price in the first half of the market rose to 18.12 yuan, while in the second half of the market, it fell slightly, but its highest market price was still between 17.78 yuan and 18 yuan. General hoarding households, seeing the increase in sales, again stopped selling high- and medium-grade japonica rice, hoarding and raising prices.

Rice Price Limit Not Revoked

Since the Evaluation Committee resolved to dissolve itself on the 20th of this month, some simple-minded rice merchants believed that the price limit had been revoked along with it, so they acted wantonly in the market, becoming even more unrestrained and transacting on a large scale. According to investigations by the Dagang News Agency, the rice price limit was decided by the seven rice industry groups in the city at the third joint meeting. The Rice Grain Evaluation Committee was also produced by these groups. Although the Evaluation Committee has been dissolved, the case of the rice price limit still exists and has not been revoked. In terms of law, the Evaluation Committee should not have decided to dissolve itself. According to precedent, the power of dissolution must be decided by the seven groups to be legal.

Concession Authorities Crack Down on Manipulation

The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession and the Municipal Council of the French Concession are extremely concerned about the regulation of rice grain and the high prices in Shanghai. Detailed investigations have been made into various grains that are directly related to people's food, and it is believed that the existing stocks of rice and flour in Shanghai are sufficient to maintain supply for six months, and there is no shortage even during the lean season. The current abnormal surge in market prices in the rice market, increasing the burden on citizens and affecting public order, is extremely serious. It is evident that speculators are manipulating the market, which is abhorrent. Therefore, the two authorities have already ordered the police to dispatch detectives to the market every morning for secret investigations. Once discovered, they will be severely cracked down and severely punished as a warning to others.

Ways to Dredge Sources of Rice Grain

The registration of rice stocks by owners, which was organized by the previous Price Committee, will end in a few days. Regarding the investigation of rice stocks in the two concessions of Shanghai thereafter, it has been decided that the Bean and Rice Industry Association will be responsible for continuing to handle it. Although dredging the source of national rice is beyond the power of rice industry groups, in order to maintain the people's food in the concession, it has been decided to make every effort to ensure that the people's food is not in panic. Rice merchants have all taken maintaining the people's food and taking care of the overall situation as their purpose, and are making every effort to dredge sources, and will not take profit as the only goal. According to the current situation forecast, the rice and grain situation in Shanghai will not reach a very serious level, and the situation in the winter of 1937 will not be repeated.

Secretly Entrusted to Order Foreign Rice

According to investigations by the Dagang News Agency, recently, some rice and grain companies that specialize in entrepot trade, seeing that the price of national rice has soared and is equal to the price of foreign rice, and that it is continuing to rise, have ordered foreign rice from Saigon, Annam, and other places abroad, all entrusted to foreign firms to handle. However, the orderers are keeping it a secret, and the amount is about 10,000 to 100,000 bags. As for the foreign rice that has been imported from January to March this year, the total amount is 700,912.9 metric tons, valued at 12,232,638 yuan (national currency).

### Shanghai Telephone Company Business Report 1938

According to the Shanghai Telephone Company's report for the year ended December 31, 1938, in terms of economic income, its profit was 948,200 yuan (Chinese currency), which was 20,205 yuan more than in 1917. Although its net income was better than in the previous year, various operating expenses have also increased compared to the previous year. At the beginning of 1938, the telephone business showed a vigorous atmosphere, and the number of people who needed telephone service was increasing day by day. Therefore, after the year-end statistics, the number of telephones exceeded the highest number before the war by 2,966. In the year 1938, the number of telephones increased by 17,860. As of December 31, 1938, the total number of telephones was 62,355.

In addition to the significant increase in the number of telephones, the number of uses per telephone has also increased. In 1938, the total number of calls made was 126 million, which was 24 million more than the number in 19317, which was 102 million. In order to cope with this rapid development, 7,000 additional meters were installed. Also, due to the increase in telephones in various new areas, additional trunk lines were added to meet the needs.

In addition, the reconstruction of the main stations that needed repair, such as Hongqiao Road and Huade Road, was also completed in 1938. In May, telephone service was restored in various areas near Shanghai. Telephone communication between Shanghai and Japan was restored in mid-October. And starting on January 1, 1939, telephone communication between Shanghai and the mainland was restored, in two locations.

### French Huifeng Bank Praises the Reliability of Chinese Government Bonds

The French-language Shanghai Daily reported on the 21st that at the recent shareholders' meeting of the local French Huifeng Bank (transliteration), the board of directors presented a report praising the reliability of Chinese government bonds. It was stated that since the outbreak of the war, the Chinese government has been able to maintain the credibility of its domestic debt and is fully responsible for it. It is reported that the bank's operations last year generated a net profit of 167,790.87 yuan, which could have distributed a dividend of 7%, but the bank's authorities, for the sake of prudence, only distributed a dividend of 3.5%, totaling 70,000 yuan, and the remaining profit of 97,790.87 yuan was carried over to the next operating year.

### British Volunteer Service Urges Shanghai Overseas Chinese to Register, Notification Issued by British Groups, Details Available from the British Consulate

The Continental Daily News reported that yesterday (the 21st), it was learned that the British Volunteer Service Registration System has been extended to Shanghai. The British Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Branch of the China Association, and the British Overseas Chinese Association in China have sent notices to their members stating that a list of British male and female nationals suitable for military service is currently being compiled in an emergency. If the recipient of the letter or any British national employed by him is concerned about this matter, please apply to the passport officer of the British Consulate General for all details. The Volunteer Service Registration System has been in progress in Britain for four months, calling on professional men and women to make strict voluntary registration, and has been extended to all parts of the world where there are British overseas Chinese.

### Public Works Bureau Revises Cold Drink Regulations

Restaurants Not Allowed to Use Cold Dishes

Whether to Continue This Year is Still Under Study The Public Works Bureau's Health Department believes that with the arrival of summer and the increasingly hot weather, unclean cold drinks are likely to cause disease, so it is extremely concerned. Recently, it has revised Article 4 of the Other Food License Regulations as follows: "Soda water and non-carbonated water for human consumption shall be made with clean and sanitary water that has been boiled, distilled, filtered, or disinfected by other methods in a hygienic manner, and a new clause has been added:" Distilled water for human consumption shall be distilled with clean and sanitary water in a hygienic manner." Also, last summer, the Public Works Bureau's Health Department, due to the unhygienic nature of the cold dishes in restaurants, ordered the Restaurant Association not to use them, which was quite effective. This year's deadline is approaching, and the Bureau is currently studying whether to continue to implement it, and will issue a clear order.

### Wang Yiting Memorial Society Petitions the National Government for a Biography, Petition to be Issued Soon, Maintain the Industry of the Wang Family Before His Death

Permanent Commemoration Measures for Wang Yiting According to investigations, various groups in this city have established the Wang Qinda Permanent Commemoration Committee and are actively studying it. According to sources in the Commemoration Committee, in addition to maintaining and expanding the orphanages and disability homes founded by Wang before his death, the Lake Society is also planning commemoration measures to honor Wang's methods and respect his fellow villagers. In addition, the Commemoration Committee will petition the National Government to publish Wang's life story in the National History Biography, and this petition will soon be implemented to show the State's meaning of decorating the final rites.

### Chinese Guerrillas Destroy Railroad Tracks, Burn Kunshan Station, Japanese Side is Panicked and Has Implemented Vigilance, Pressurized Cars are Dispatched for Patrols from Time to Time

Dagang News Agency reports that since the Chinese guerrilla forces controlled the outer circle of the Jiangzhe occupied area, they have given the Japanese side significant blows from time to time. Therefore, the Japanese army along the three railway lines of Jinghu, Sujiahu, and Hangzhou did not dare to lightly transfer troops. The other day, the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway tracks were destroyed by the Chinese army. According to people from Kunshan, Kunshan Station was suddenly set on fire and burned down some time ago, and the station building was almost completely destroyed. The railway material room there was also burned down, causing considerable losses. At the same time, a section of track between Kunshan and Qingyang Port was also demolished, so the Japanese army was even more frightened. Recently, in addition to dispatching pressurized cars from time to time for patrols along the lines, stone squares were also erected on both sides of the road and painted with red paint as a warning line, prohibiting people from crossing them. People in various places are also notified to report any damage to the railway tracks. Because the Japanese side has been very busy with military transportation on the lines recently, they are deeply afraid of being attacked.

### Report on Meteorological Signals, Changed to Hoisting on the French Concession Signal Tower, Moved from the Anchorage of Pilot Boats at the Mouth of the Yangtze River, Using International Language Flag Signals to Indicate Climate

The Port Affairs Section of the Jianghai Customs, in order to change the meteorological signals used to report the weather, which were originally hoisted at the anchorage of pilot boats at the entrance of the Yangtze River, to being hoisted on the Shanghai Observatory signal tower on the Bund of the French Concession, issued Announcement No. 2: "It is hereby decided that starting on June 1 of this year, all signals originally used to report the weather at the anchorage of pilot boats at the entrance of the Yangtze River will be changed to being hoisted daily from 11:00 AM to 11:30 AM (the observation time is 10:00 AM local time) on the Shanghai Observatory signal tower on the Bund of the French Concession. These signals all use International Language flag signals. The flag signal at the top is used to indicate the degree of wind direction (N for north, S for south, E for east, W for west). The next flag signal is used to indicate the number of wind force according to the Beaufort scale. The wind force above number 10 is not usually indicated. At that time, the Customs flag platform will already have hoisted a gale signal separately. Other signals such as the F flag signal indicate heavy fog, the U flag signal indicates not sunny, and the V flag signal indicates changing wind direction. This announcement is hereby issued to inform all wheel merchants, etc. Special announcement."

### Notorious Bandit Jin Longzhang Active in Shanghai

Jin Longzhang, a notorious bandit from central Hubei, led his henchmen during the August 13th Incident, rampaging through Xiangfan and devastating the local area. Later, after the fall of Wuhan, Jin was drawn into activities through the mediation of a Mr. Chen. Jin flew from Hankou to Shanghai a few days ago to request funding in an attempt to expand the puppet "Anti-Communist Army."

### Over Forty Organizations Publicly Mourn Fang Xuanqing

Mr. Fang Xuanqing, a respected elder from a prominent Zhenhai family, unfortunately passed away on August 18th of the 27th year of the Republic. His heir, Yixian, has a distinguished career and is particularly renowned. It is reported that the Fang family held a memorial service yesterday (the 21st) afternoon at the Lake Society on Beijing Road. More than forty organizations and companies participated in the public mourning, including the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, the China General Chamber of Industry, the Joint Machine Association, the Cosmetics Industry, the Chinese and Foreign Sundries Industry, the Glass Manufacturing Industry, the Seasoning Manufacturing Industry, the Banking Industry, the Shipping Industry, and other trade associations, the Accountants Association, the Chinese Contingent of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, as well as the China National Products United Corporation, the National Products Company, the China Chemical Industry Society, Wing On Company, Kai Cheng Company, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, and others.

### Unstable Situation in Fujian Sea, Shanghai-Fujian Shipping Disrupted, Foreign Shipping Companies Plan to Temporarily Suspend Sailings for Safety

The situation in the Fujian Sea has become tense due to harassment by Japanese aircraft and warships. Later, as the Japanese warships left one after another, the situation eased somewhat. However, according to recent reports received by the shipping industry, Japanese warships in the Fujian Sea are moving very frequently. On the morning of the 19th, Fuzhou was bombarded by Japanese warships, and Japanese aircraft also flew to Dabi for bombing. Currently, there are five Japanese warships anchored outside the port of Mawei, constantly launching speedboats for reconnaissance, indicating some intention. The situation is quite tense. The Shanghai-Fujian shipping routes originally included three major routes: Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Xinghua. Since the economic center of gravity of Fujian Province shifted to Quanzhou and other places, passenger and cargo transportation has prospered. Now, various foreign shipping companies, due to the tense situation in Fujian Province and for the sake of shipping safety, plan to temporarily suspend sailings and dock in Shanghai. Therefore, shipping from Shanghai to Fujian Province may be interrupted indefinitely.

### Charity Art Exhibition Closed Last Night

The Shanghai Art Charity Relief Exhibition, organized by the China Industrial and Commercial Art Writers Association, has been held on the fourth floor of the Great Sun Company since its opening on the twelfth of this month. The items collected, though small, are all crystallizations of art, and have been highly valued by all sectors. Divided into categories such as arts and crafts, commercial art, paintings, Western paintings, sculptures, artistic photography, antiques, etc., there were no fewer than 5,000 pieces, which were replaced daily. In particular, Wu Guangji's jade seal boxes of various styles and the finely carved sailboat models are considered top-notch. As for the truly large goose skin produced in Longxi, meticulously crafted to be soft and smooth, with jade-like purity and a lustrous sheen, priced at 1,000 yuan, it was even more a highlight of the venue. The association, with the ten-day period expired, announced its closure at 7:00 p.m. last night. This exhibition was entirely for the purpose of charity relief. Except for the exhibitors who declared that they would take back half the price, the rest was donated to refugee relief efforts.

### Romanian Ambassador to Japan to Pass Through Shanghai Next Month on His Way Home

According to the French-language Shanghai Daily on the 21st, the Romanian Ambassador to Japan, Stotescu (transliteration), will leave Japan on June 1st, pass through Shanghai, and return to his country.

### A Youth Model Person

— Zhou

——Mr. Yuan Ludeng——

Mr. Yuan Ludeng is a youth model person who succeeded through hard study in his youth. In middle age, he served the society and participated in all kinds of public welfare activities. Throughout his life, he benefited from "knowing contentment and not being disgraced." His interests are quite in the style of Tao Jingjie, and even his drinking is very much in the spirit of "friends knowing he is good at drinking, they may set up wine and invite him." However, he does not necessarily aim to get drunk.

When the reporter went to interview him, Mr. Yuan was waving his hand and sending off the processing of his official duties at the Refugee Association. He is sixty-one years old this year, and his spirit is vigorous. A cloth gown clearly shows his simple habits. Behind his seat hangs a picture of a white-haired man entertaining his parents, commemorating his family's four generations under one roof. Grand Historian Shen Qiquan (art) and others wrote poems for him, saying, "Joyful laughter in the hall above, laughter below, indeed filial sons and virtuous grandchildren."

We began to talk about the future of refugee relief, and he said: There are currently more than 50,000 refugees housed in the Shanghai International Settlement. Including the refugee areas in Nanshi, there should be more than 100,000. The street refugees who have not been housed, and those who have recently come to Shanghai to take refuge, are still impossible to count. Currently, donations from all sectors can be described as enthusiastic. The association is actively working on the production and education of refugees, paying particular attention to the resettlement of refugees. Within a considerable period of time, a concrete result can be expected, giving refugees the technical skills to support themselves. Of course, this concrete result still requires the continued efforts and assistance of all sectors.

He began to speak freely about his personal interests and living conditions. He said that in addition to opium, he has always been fond of both smoking and drinking. However, for more than ten years, he has not bought wine or cigarettes himself, always receiving gifts from friends. He has the style of "only wine has no limit." I asked him, "How about two catties?" He said, "Three catties are also fine." He gets up at 6:30 every morning, practices martial arts, and goes to the association at 9:00 to handle official duties. He has several self-criticisms regarding his own strengths and weaknesses in life: (1) I have been trained by missionary schools since childhood and am determined to adhere to the principle of benefiting others at the expense of oneself. I have never been troubled by any hobbies in my life. (2) I came from humble beginnings as a student, and I have never forgotten the situation at the time. No matter how smooth the circumstances, I have never aspired to be pampered and comfortable. (3) I have never been annoyed by occasional setbacks. I have always held the ancient teaching of accepting adversity with equanimity. (4) I have never harbored selfish opinions in my life, whether towards society or family. I would rather suffer sacrifices than seek my own advantage. (5) Although I have often followed the customs and trends in recent years, I have never dared to cross the boundaries of morality. As for the weaknesses of self-examination, they are: (1) I am naturally straightforward. When I see someone's faults, I must advise them, or even rebuke them in person. I may not be able to be forgiven by others. Although I want to try to cultivate patience, it is already too late. (2) In my life, I place too much emphasis on sentiment. I often act rashly regardless of my abilities, such as investing in unlimited companies and serving as a director of unregistered joint-stock companies, and providing unlimited guarantees for others. I know there is a risk of bankruptcy, but I often think that people will not deceive me, and I do not know how to warn myself. (3) I am not good at managing money. As long as I have money on hand, or have a way to raise funds, I will help others in difficulty. As a result, my own burden has become heavier and heavier, and I have to rely on the help of close friends, which makes me feel ashamed. Speaking to this point, he hopes that young people in the business community can use his self-criticism as a reference.

Continuing in his recollection, he narrated the circumstances of his hard study in his youth, saying: "When I was ten years old, I went to school with my younger brother. Three years later, because of the poverty of the family, even the meager tuition fees were difficult to raise. I originally planned to drop out of school, but at that time I wanted to learn a trade, but I suffered from the lack of someone to support me. At that time, the British Jesus Church and the Common Society happened to set up a Kai Ming School in Yong, with an attached primary school, which did not charge tuition. So I went to school there. After two more years, it was changed to Fei Di Middle School. My younger brother and I were favored by the missionaries and admitted to the school free of charge. The following year, I took the exam and was fortunate enough to win the championship. I also received an annual scholarship of six pounds sterling from the Royal Education Road School in London. The missionary distributed half of it for tuition and half for family use." At this point, Mr. Yuan has become a good young man who dared to study in a poor family. (To be continued)

### Tragedy of Fire in Guling Road, Strict Interrogation into Cause of Fire, Cook Denies That Burned Yarn Spools Caused the Fire, Paper Shop Has Fire Insurance Worthy of Note

In the kitchen of the Chen family at No. 70 Guling Road, a fire suddenly broke out at around 5:00 a.m. on the 11th of this month. The wind was strong, and the flames immediately shot up, burning through the mezzanine floor. Chen Zubei, a water company worker living upstairs, and his wife and children, were awakened from their dreams by the burning skin. They got up in extreme pain and immediately carried his wife, Mrs. Yu, and their seven-year-old third son, Shi Mai, jumping and escaping. Mrs. Yu suffered minor injuries. Their thirteen-year-old daughter, Jin Di, also escaped, but had been burned. The most tragic were their ten-year-old eldest son, Qingqing, and nine-year-old second son, Yu Qing, who

perished in the fire

After the fire brigade extinguished the fire, Chen Da, a detective from the New Zha Pu Fang in charge, and others arrived at the scene. They sent the injured to the hospital for treatment, examined the burnt corpses, and ordered them to be collected. It was later found that the fire was caused by the re-ignition of the ashes of burned yarn spools placed by Shi Chenglang, a Tongzhou cook hired by Qian Jichen, who was operating cotton yarn in the third room of the house. The fire spread to the paper piled nearby, causing such a tragedy. Shi was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court and prosecuted according to law. The details of the interrogation and detention have been recorded in previous reports. Now, the thirteen-year-old girl, Jin Di, who was burned, also

succumbed to her injuries

and died a few days ago. Therefore, Chen Zubei's three sons and one daughter, now only the youngest Bao Bao remains. Although Mrs. Yu's injuries have been healed, she is extremely grieved by the tragic death of her two children. On Saturday, the case was heard in the Second Criminal Court by Judge Xiao of the First Special Court. When Shi Chenglang was brought up for further interrogation, Chen Yu stood beside the case, tears streaming down her face. She also stated that the defendant usually stored the ashes from burning yarn spools in a Pu bag and had repeatedly seen him placing the Pu bag near the pile of paper. She had advised him, but the defendant never listened.

resulting in the tragedy

Chen Awu, a cooking apprentice from the second landlord Chen's family, testified that he and Shi cooked in the same stove. Shi always cooked first in the stove at five or six in the morning, while he started cooking at seven or eight. Shi always used a Pu saw to store the ashes from burning yarn spools, so that he could pick out iron pieces in his spare time and sell them. When questioned, Shi flatly denied that he had caused the fire. Then the debate began. Li Zhishan, the lawyer from the Public Security Bureau, argued that, based on the physical evidence of the burned yarn spools obtained by the Public Security Bureau and the testimony of Chen Awu, it could be proved that the defendant was responsible for the disaster and should be punished according to the law. However, Wang Xiaowen, the defendant's defense lawyer, requested the court to pay

close attention

to the fact that the second landlord of the house had set up a paper shop in the house and had fire insurance of 8,000 taels of silver. According to insurance regulations, compensation is only given if someone else's fire spreads and affects the insured. Chen Awu is an apprentice of the second landlord and cooks in the same stove as the defendant. If he is judged to be responsible for the disaster based solely on his words, it seems inappropriate. How could it be known that there were no other circumstances? Moreover, the price of yarn spools is not very cheap. Even if one wants to extract iron pieces, there is no need to use them as fuel. The judge ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and scheduled a date for sentencing.

### Kidnappings Occur Frequently in Occupied Areas, One Bandit Executed by Firing Squad

In the towns and villages of Xinjing, Hongqiao, Qibao, and Changqiao in northwestern Shanghai, bandits are rampant and robberies are frequent since the area was occupied. Recently, they have become even more unscrupulous, daring to kidnap people for ransom in broad daylight. The puppet police generally turn a blind eye. Shen Zhigang, who lives in Caojiazhai, east of Beixinjing Town, was suddenly kidnapped by five bandits at around 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday while Shen was in a tea house of a certain family in Beixinjing Town. Each bandit had a handgun. Shen was taken away and subjected to severe torture in the bandit's den. After half a month, his family managed to raise 800 yuan to redeem him and bring him home. Wang, the Ningbo owner of the Gong Sheng Weaving Factory in Gongjiazhai, north of Lincoln Road, was also kidnapped by bandits in broad daylight and demanded a ransom of 100,000 yuan. After several negotiations, he paid 16,000 yuan in foreign currency and was released the day before yesterday. Ding Shanming, the owner of the Yilong Rice Store in Hongqiao Town, was kidnapped in his store last month and has now been redeemed, but he still dares not return home. The old bookkeeper of the Yang Dingyuan Rice Store in Qibao Town's North Main Street was kidnapped with 7 staff members the night before last. It is heard that four of the old bookkeepers were released that night, but three staff members, including an employee Li, are still not out of danger. Shen Xiao Amei, a local who opened a cotton ginning factory in Changqiao Town on the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road, was kidnapped by bandits the day before yesterday. His family paid 2,600 yuan in foreign currency to redeem him. Wang, the battalion commander of the 3rd regiment of the provincial security team, learned of the matter and arrested Kang Yinquan (former town mayor of Caojiaqiao from Guangang), one of the bandits involved. After interrogation, Wang determined that the confession was true. The day before yesterday, Kang was tied up and executed by firing squad in Changqiao Town. The remaining accomplices, Cai and others, are at large and are currently being hunted down.

### Apprentice Prostitutes Himself and Embezzles Public Funds, Sentenced to Eight Months in Prison

Zhang Xuecheng, a native of Huzhou (24 years old), who is an apprentice at the Zhiyuan Transportation Company at No. 11 North Suzhou Road, is still unmarried. Recently, he has been fond of prostitution. At 4:00 p.m. on the 27th of last month, Wang Enpu, the manager of the company, gave him 350 yuan in legal tender, ordering him to send it to the Xixing Silk Store on Shanxi Road. Zhang, after obtaining the money, abandoned a receipt book in a wasteland and then went to prostitute himself at No. 49 West Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession with a prostitute named Hongbao, and at No. 9 Aiduya Road with a prostitute named Suzhen. He spent all the money in two weeks and avoided going to work at the company. Manager Wang Enpu negotiated with his guarantor surnamed Chen, and as a result, he paid 200 yuan in compensation. The afternoon before yesterday, at around 8:00 p.m., apprentice Zhang suddenly went to the transportation company to make a scene with Wang Enpu, wanting to get back the money compensated by the guarantor. The Public Security Bureau sent a detective, Shen Dehui, to the scene and brought him into the Public Security Bureau. The day before yesterday, he was sent to the First Special Court, where Judge Jiang Shuzi found him guilty and sentenced Zhang Xuecheng to eight months in prison as a warning.

### Carrying Silver Ingots and Coins to Shanghai, Scoundrels Intercept and Extort, Police Investigate and Detain

Ji Yuanyu, a native of Suzhou, was recently instructed by Zhou Jintang, the owner of the Wansheng Silver Store on Manong Street in Suzhou, to bring ten raw silver ingots, weighing 200 taels, and 379 yuan in coins to Shanghai, intending to exchange them for legal tender at a certain money shop. At 10:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, while passing near the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Zha Pu Road, Wang Xinhai, a native of Yong who used to be a teacher at the Huaxing Primary School at No. 72 Tangshan Road, saw him,

stepped forward and stopped him

and asked about the source of the raw silver ingots and coins. Wang immediately falsely claimed that he was an investigator from the puppet consolidated tax bureau and that such silver must be taxed, otherwise he would be taken to the bureau for punishment. He demanded a fee of 50 yuan to avoid this. Ji Yuanyu was anxious and first gave him 9 yuan and 32 cents in legal tender. While they were arguing, Wang Debiao, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Public Security Bureau, and No. 433 Indian police saw them.

Teacher Wang immediately ran away, but was eventually caught. He was brought to the Public Security Bureau along with Ji Yuanyu's raw silver coins, silver ingots. The day before yesterday, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The lawyer from the Public Security Bureau, Zhang Tianyin, explained the case, and said that the defendant was also suspected of another theft case, and asked for a postponement. According to Ji Yuanyu's testimony of the events, Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the defendant and ruled that he be remanded in custody and scheduled another hearing.

### Addicted to Gambling on Lotteries, Commits Suicide by Hanging

Yang Fubao, a native of Hangzhou, was 37 years old this year. He was unemployed and destitute, and was staying at the home of his friend, Yuan Guisheng, at No. 5 Beifu Lane, La Ge Na Road, French Concession. Because he was addicted to gambling on lotteries, and lost every time, resulting in a mountain of debt that he could not repay, he became despondent. Yesterday morning, he hanged himself on the iron railing of the drying platform stairs at Yuan's house. When his friend, Yuan Guisheng, got up and discovered him, he was already dead and beyond help. He reported it to the Public Security Bureau, who sent the corpse to the Tongren Fuyuan sub-hall for autopsy. The deceased had no family in Shanghai and will be reported to the court for inspection today.

### Gambling Den Cracked Down on in Ailai Ge Road

A gambling den was cracked down on at Longyuan Theater, Ailai Ge Road, Xinmin Lane, French Concession, where people were gambling and selling lottery tickets. The Public Security Bureau found out about it. The night before last, they dispatched more than ten Chinese and foreign detectives in two cars to the location without making a sound. Thirty gamblers who were shouting and gambling were captured on the upper floor of the theater, along with gambling tools and gambling money. They were all taken to the Public Security Bureau, questioned one by one by the head of the Public Security Bureau, and then sent to the Lujiawan General Patrol Room along with the boss to await interrogation by the court.

### Russian Woman Commits Suicide

According to the French-language Shanghai Daily, a young Russian woman named Mozhina (transliteration), 21 years old, who lives at No. 118 Notre Dame Road, suddenly committed suicide by taking poison at 2:00 p.m. yesterday.

### Dancer's Diamond Ring Stolen, Tenant Countersues for False Accusation

Yang Meili, a 22-year-old woman from Suzhou who used to be a dancer, living in the front building of No. 483 Fuxu Road, had a diamond ring hidden under her pillow on the bed stolen at noon on March 25th of the lunar calendar. Because Ma Zhao (47 years old), a fellow villager who lived in the back building, had come to her room to pick grass roots and was suspected, she reported it to the French Public Security Bureau. Ma Zhao was taken into custody for interrogation and detained for one night. Because there was no evidence of theft, she was released the next day. Now, Ma Zhao, whose husband is a prompter at the Great Stage, argued that she had been falsely accused of theft for no reason, which had affected her reputation, so she hired attorney Ling Xianlai to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Yang Meili of false accusation. Judge Miao Qingbang opened the court for trial the day before yesterday. The plaintiff and her lawyer appeared in court and stated the previous situation. The defendant, Yang Meili, testified that on that day, she and her sister were cooking downstairs, and there was no one in the room. The defendant came to my room to pick grass roots. When I went upstairs, the diamond ring was gone, so I reported it to the Public Security Bureau. When the detectives came to investigate, the defendant suddenly went out. After she came back, I went to the Public Security Bureau with her. My diamond ring was seen by everyone living in the same room, and everyone knew it was stolen. There was no false accusation. The court ordered the debate to end and scheduled a date for sentencing.

Because the defendants were all minors, Xu Asi and Wang Xiaomao were sentenced to five years in prison for joint murder, and Li Damao and Liu Bingqing were sentenced to three years in prison for assisting in murder. Xu Asi and others were dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court.

### Cao Bingsheng Dies in the Line of Duty, Special Compensation Given, and Gold Medal Awarded

Cao is the first Chinese personnel in the French Police Department to receive this gold medal of honor. It is also heard that various groups and celebrities in the city will jointly initiate a memorial service, which is currently being prepared.

### Buddhist Community Compiles and Prints a Grand Edition of the Avatamsaka Sutra

The Avatamsaka Sutra in Buddhism has a complete and wonderful meaning that surpasses everything. In the Tang Dynasty, the National Teacher Qingliang devoted his entire life's wisdom to writing a commentary on the Avatamsaka Sutra, elaborating on the meaning of the scripture, totaling sixty or seventy volumes. Its great value has always been revered by the Buddhist community. However, from the Song and Ming Dynasties to the Qing Dynasty, the transmission and engraving were corrupted, which was a major flaw. Recently, Elder Yingci and various lay Buddhists plan to recompile, collate, and reprint the book based on more than ten versions, in order to achieve the merit of receiving, upholding, lecturing, and reciting the scriptures, and to complete the incomplete classics of the past 1,300 years. A "Avatamsaka Sutra Commentary Compilation and Printing Association" was specially established at the Gongdelin Temple in this city on the 18th of this month, with the address at No. 712 Wei Hai Wei Road, specializing in this matter. The estimated printing cost is 20,000 yuan. Elder Yingci was publicly elected as the chairman, and Zhu Ziqiao, Ye Yufu, and Jiang Zhuzhuang were elected as the vice chairmen. Dharma Master Yuedong, Guan Jiongzhi, Shi Shengzhi, Fan Gunong, Li Qiqing, Li Yuanjing, Meng Wangqu, Ni Wenqing, Zhu Xiechen, Huang Youxi, and Fei Fanjiu were elected as permanent directors. Wen Lantian, Huang Hanzhi, Wu Yun, Ji Juemi, Nie Lingtai, Ding Zhonghu, Bao Cunwo, Wang Qiuhu, and Sheng Shengjiao were elected as directors, and prayed and made vows before the Buddha, resolving to complete the publication within three years. With this merit, they will dedicate it to all sentient beings in the world, eliminate karma, and bring about peace quickly. The printing fee of several thousand yuan has already been determined and deposited in the Jin Cheng Bank. In the future, payment will be made according to the book’s material costs, which is different from ordinary fundraising. The estimated price per book is 20 yuan, which will still be calculated according to the cost of the book at the time.

### More Than Twenty Garbage Boats from the Two Concessions Detained in Southern Huangpu. Water Police Station Dispatches Japanese Personnel to Negotiate. Puppet "Water Police Team" Shrugs Off Responsibility

The garbage produced daily in the two special districts, the Public Concession and the French Concession, was transported by boats from the garbage wharf before the war, concentrated and dumped at the Longhua corner of the Southern Huangpu River. The old practice was continued after the war without hindrance. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, in the waters near Bailianjing (before reaching Longhua) in the Southern Huangpu, the puppet "Police Bureau Water Police Team" arbitrarily detained more than twenty garbage boats from the two concessions. It is reported that all the detained boats were fully loaded with garbage and had not yet reached their destination for dumping. In the afternoon of the same day, the Customs Water Police Station dispatched Japanese personnel to negotiate at the puppet "team" in Dongchang Road, Pudong. The puppet "Captain" Huo Liangchen evaded the responsibility by saying that he was acting on "orders from superiors," resulting in no results. The detained garbage boats had not been released as of yesterday afternoon.

### Husband Hates Wife's Infidelity, Chops Injures Adulterers. Murderer Li Genlin Arrested.

Li Genlin, a native of Taizhou, a clerk at the Youxin Shoe Store on Xinzha Road, 25 years old, married Xu Xiuying, a woman from the same hometown (21 years old). Recently, due to the high cost of living, his wife was introduced to work as a maid in a Japanese family in Hongkou. She then developed an affair with Zhang Yongnian (28 years old), a fellow townsman who worked as a clerk in a Japanese store at No. 385 Wusong Road, Hongkou. After Li discovered this, he forced Xiuying to resign and return home. Not long after, Xiuying went to work as a maid in another Japanese home and continued her relationship with Zhang. Li, lacking a pass to Hongkou, could not go to Hongkou to negotiate, though he was filled with resentment. Until the night before last, Li learned that his wife and Zhang Yongnian had gone to the Haihualou Restaurant on North Zhejiang Road to attend a birthday banquet at a certain surname's house. Li secretly hid an axe and waited near the restaurant. At about 8:00 PM, when Xiuying and Zhang were walking out arm in arm after the banquet, Li immediately used the axe to chop at them several times. They fell to the ground wounded. Police officers rushed to the scene and summoned a car to send the woman to Guangren Hospital, while Zhang was sent to Baolong Hospital. The murderer Li Genlin has been arrested by the Huishi Police Station.

### Apartment Owner Instigates Assault, Fined

Recently, Hu Shaochuan (37 years old, from Liyang), a former clerk of the Suzhou Wuxian Local Court, fled to Shanghai with his wife, Ms. Qian, due to the fall of Suzhou and the closure of the court. They resided in Room 219 of the Continental Apartment at No. 431 Rue Poupard (i.e. Datiebang), French Concession, paying a daily rent of one yuan. After living there for two months, they owed more than ten yuan in rent. On the night of March 14, the apartment manager, Xin Lichong from Ningbo, and the accountant, Xin Runquan, ordered a waiter to urge Hu to pay the rent. Due to a verbal conflict, Xin and others instigated Bai Yan, a clerk from the Hetaixing store in Room 103, to drag Hu out of his room and beat him violently. Hu's wife, Ms. Qian, stepped forward to dissuade them and was also beaten. The four-month-old child she was holding was also knocked to the ground, and developed a frightening sickness that led to his death. The Hu couple first filed a petition with the Special Second Court Procuratorate requesting a medical examination, and then hired lawyer Yao Yunbo to file a private prosecution for assault against Xin Lichong and Xin Runquan with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court. Judge Liao Heng repeatedly opened court sessions for investigation, and summoned Le Wenchun, a resident of the Continental Apartment from Ningbo, to testify about the defendants' assault. The defendants admitted to instigating the assault and hired lawyers for their defense. The case was already concluded with the two defendants released on bail pending further review. This case has been concluded after interrogation and was adjudicated the day before yesterday. Xin Lichong was fined 400 yuan for instigating bodily harm, and Xin Runquan was fined 240 yuan for the same crime. It is reported that the defendants are dissatisfied with the verdict and are preparing to appeal to the High Third Branch Court.

### Overview of the Work Report of the Animal Protection Society in March and April

The Shanghai Animal Protection Society reported in March and April of this year that countless people have called or come to the Society in person during these two months, requesting assistance in tracking down missing cats and dogs, entrusting the Society to find people to take in cats and dogs, or wanting to adopt cats and dogs. Although arranging for the accommodation of abandoned cats and dogs and pursuing missing cats and dogs can be regarded as a method of animal protection, most humanitarian societies do not regard it as within the scope of their activities. Therefore, there are small self-sufficient organizations specifically set up for this purpose, but no such organization exists in Shanghai. As a result, the Society's limited staff are extremely busy with this work, which takes up their time and energy to deal with more urgent matters.

Assistance and Protection Methods

Members of the public can provide great assistance to the Society in this matter by following the methods below: (1) Implement various preventive measures to avoid cats and dogs from getting lost or being stolen, such as instructing servants to close the doors of gardens and residences and pay attention to the integrity of garden fences; (2) When servants walk dogs, they must be instructed to leash the dog by the neck and take it for a walk, allowing it to walk on crowded streets; (3) The dog's license plate must always be attached to the collar, and the collar must always be worn, so that even if the dog is lost, there is a license number to check to find its owner; (4) Those who want to adopt cats and dogs can go directly to the dog houses of the French Concession or the Public Concession工部局to select them, without having to contact the Society first; (5) Join the Society as a member and pay membership fees or donate funds to expand the number of staff to cope with this matter.

General Abuse of Animals

The worst case of abuse in this period was found in the Caojiabo slaughterhouse outside the concession, where pigs, horses and cattle were inhumanely slaughtered, either chopped with axes or hoes, or allowed to bleed to death slowly. These abuse incidents have been published in newspapers and the March issue of the Blue Cross Magazine (the Society's quarterly). It is known that many horses abandoned after the races are sold and enter this slaughterhouse from the stables to suffer a terrible death. Therefore, the Society has appealed to racehorse owners to humanely destroy lame and unsuitable horses, and prevent them from participating in auctions. The Society is now taking possible steps to remedy the situation in this slaughterhouse, but due to its location outside the concession, it is difficult to take strict action. At present, the Society is working to prevent horses from being sent to this terrible slaughterhouse.

When the investigator last inspected the slaughterhouse, he saw a water buffalo lying on the ground, its limbs tied to wooden pillars, its head tied to an iron ring on the ground, and a two-inch diameter wound cut in its neck, allowing it to bleed to death.

On March 7, a member of the Society reported seeing a lame horse being dragged along Daxilu. After investigation, it was found that the horse was being taken by a groom to the above-mentioned slaughterhouse to suffer a terrible death. The Society immediately visited the horse owner and arranged for the horse to be humanely destroyed. The horse's body was then removed by strangers. On one of the hottest days in April, it was reported that two calves had collapsed on Jiangxi Road. The Society's ambulance immediately transported them to their destination. The owner was fined ten yuan by the French Concession authorities.

Investigators have repeatedly discovered the live plucking of pig bristles. One case was prosecuted in court, and the offender was sentenced to ten days in jail for theft.

### Preparatory Meeting of Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory

The second preparatory meeting of Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory was held yesterday at Zhongxi Pharmacy on Simalu. Cai Renbao, Zhou Bangjun, Xia Xishi, and others attended. Zhou Bangjun presided over the meeting and reported on (1) Since the public offering of shares, the outside world has been very enthusiastic about subscriptions, and the paid-up capital will reach 400,000 yuan, only one-fifth short of the original amount; (2) The factory building and equipment in Xinjiagarden, Xinzha Road, have been installed separately from the original machines, and are working as usual. The latest type of pharmaceutical machine has been ordered to extract industrial chemical application raw materials and the main raw materials of medicines; (3) The expert technical discussion has been completed. Then, several points were discussed: (1) Xia Xishi proposed that the factory produces hundreds of species, and shareholders should be asked to promote and sell them. It was decided to print shareholder preferential purchase certificates and send them to shareholders when they pay for their shares. A letter was also sent to Zhongxi Pharmacy for agreement. Shareholders of this factory will be given the same special price; (2) Cai Renbao proposed that many people who have subscribed to the shares are refugees from other places and should be given work opportunities to implement labor-capital cooperation. It was decided that when the factory's business becomes more extensive, and the original staff workers' training is insufficient, shareholders will be given priority for those they recommend, but they must pass the examination and selection procedures, and be given training.

### Pharmaceutical News

Ye Tiande Pharmacy New Building Opens the Day After Tomorrow

Ye Tiande Pharmacy has been located at Zhonghongqiao, Hongkou for several decades, and is an old shop.

### Letter

Dear Editor, according to Pan Baocheng, the owner of Santai Rice Shop, my client, the Shen Bao of the 20th of this month carries a news item about a rice shop owner being sued, which states, "Only seeking profit for oneself, disregarding the harm to others, disregarding the health of employees, abandoning them after being injured on duty without treatment, and being intentionally cruel," all of which are inconsistent with the facts. When Zhao Xuesheng, the substitute worker, was injured, I was not present. His stacking of goods was an automatic act in his job. How he stacked it, how he was injured, I do not know. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, and the medical expenses were borne by this shop. Later, Xuesheng's brother, Ahe, moved Xuesheng from Guangci Hospital to Lixing Inn on Wuhu Road, and this shop continued to bear the medical expenses. Then Ahe carried Xuesheng to this shop. Xuesheng himself considered returning to the inn, but the inn refused to accept him. Then, Wang Atao, the official worker, and Zhao Ahe asked the patrolman to report the case and sent him to Renji Hospital. How the inn refused to accept him, and how the police were reported, are all unknown to me. Moreover, Jue Sunshunsheng is too young and does not participate in shop affairs. Last year, Zhao Ahe asked Qian, a lawyer, to send a letter to ask for a settlement. I knew his purpose and ignored it. This time, he has requested an additional 9,900 yuan in civil litigation, and part of the statement remains reserved for a subsequent request. It has come to the time when the dagger is revealed. This news is purely one-sided and should be corrected to show the facts. I am entrusted to come here. Please check and correct it according to the law. Sincerely, Lawyer Zhao Shaojun, May 20, To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao. Dear Editor, I have read the news column of your newspaper on the 20th of this month about the British Consulate investigating the International Night News, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. The newspaper will be relaunched soon, and the original editorial staff has not changed. The article suddenly refers to Xu Tianfang as the editor-in-chief, which is very surprising. The editor Wang Tianhen has not resigned either. The end of the article even refers to "Wang's faction", which is even more bizarre. It is difficult to remain silent for such a deliberate destruction of the newspaper's credibility and the use of political implications to disturb social order. In addition to handling negotiations with Huguang News Agency, please correct it as soon as possible. Sincerely, Krampe, publisher of the British-owned International Night News, May 21, To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao.

### A Message to Young Literary People with New Hobbies

— Shangqing

When addressing young literary people with old hobbies, my first sentence was: it is best if you do not indulge in literary hobbies. Now, when addressing young literary people with new hobbies, the first thing I want to say is still: it is best if you do not indulge in literary hobbies. The reason has been mentioned before, so I won't repeat it here.

Unfortunately, there are quite a few young people who are fond of old literature, and even more young people who are fond of new literature. Therefore, as a second-best option, I can only use my sincere wishes to tell young people who are fond of new literature a few words:

If you are truly fond of new literature, and you want to appreciate, study, or create it, but you don't know where to start, I suggest you start with Western literature. The establishment of our new literature can be said to be entirely influenced by Western literature. Almost all famous new literary writers are proficient in Western languages and literature. They started with Western literature, so they laid the foundation for our new literature today. However, our new literature today is still far from being fully developed and capable of enlightening future generations. We still need to work hard on the same path, and the most fundamental way is still to first understand Western literature.

To understand Western literature, it is best to be able to understand the language of a certain Western country so that you can read directly. Otherwise, reading many translated works is also a good way. Translated works with good writing and content are of course the most suitable for us. Even if the writing is not very good, as long as the content is not bad, we can still extract its essence and focus on the spirit rather than the form.

After you have read a lot of Western literature, know what the spirit of new literature is, what the differences between new literature and old literature are, and you have thoroughly understood the general technical points, then you will naturally want to start writing. Perhaps at this time you will have another question: what kind of writing should I use to write well? Or, to what extent should I write to be considered good?

There is a lot of room for flexibility in the level of "good," so I cannot set a standard or define what constitutes "good." However, I can say what the minimum level of "good" should be, and that is: it must be coherent. Sentences should not have grammatical errors; paragraphs should not have ambiguous flaws; the structure should not be too rigid or too chaotic; the intention should not be profound but not easily understood.

Of course, everyone wants to be coherent; but how can one achieve coherence? Perhaps this is the question that will ultimately arise.

To solve this problem: first, you still need to study Western literature; second, you need to study high-quality new literary works. Western literature is generally coherent, but since the writing is different, it cannot directly help our writing, so we still have to study our existing high-quality literary works. By "high-quality," I don't mean to point them out one by one. Generally speaking, new literary books published by the Commercial Press, the Chung Hwa Book Company, the World Book Company, and the Kaiming Bookstore can all be considered high-quality. Of course, there may also be high-quality new literary books published by other bookstores, but there are also some inferior ones, so you need to be selective.

I strongly disapprove of the idea that in order to create new literature, one must study old literature, as if reviewing the old can really lead to new understanding. I would rather see Europeanized sentences with awkward usage of "na ne ma" than see fluent classical Chinese clichés using "zhi hu zhe ye," because the former is easy to improve, while the latter is a deeply ingrained habit that is almost incurable. Of course, today's new literary writers did not succeed simply by studying Western literature and completely abandoning old literature. Old literature can indeed contribute to new literature. However, I believe that studying old literature always has more disadvantages than advantages. To avoid confusing people, it is best not to consult old literature.

I dare not say that the current literary supplements in newspapers and various magazines have reached a good level in terms of writing, so we don't need to emulate them. However, incoherent literature does appear in supplements or magazines, which is a fact. Because supplements and magazines have time constraints, they inevitably have oversights, unlike single-volume books, which can be carefully polished and strive for perfection. Therefore, I hope that those who want to study new literature from supplements or magazines to improve their own new literary writing should be very careful. As for some deliberately superficial writing with ulterior motives, I think you shouldn't learn it at all.

When you have a complete grasp of the content and form of new literature, you can naturally start writing freely. But when you create, I still want to tell you two things:

Do not use your talent to engage in destructive work. Sarcasm and ridicule are sometimes necessary, but you shouldn't think that it is the only skill a writer should have. The garden of literature is vast, and the flowers and fruits in it are definitely not just cursing or ridiculing people. As for cursing wrongly or unreasonably, that is of course not allowed. Why have writers been looked down upon throughout history and called "frivolous"? This tradition of excluding dissenters is also a major reason! Similarly, self-promotion, mutual flattery, and self-congratulation are also undesirable, as their only effect is to destroy literature and misuse your talent. I hope you can also avoid these.

Do not write articles solely for yourself, especially not in the current era. "Art for art's sake" may be acceptable in prosperous times, but now, if you have the talent for writing, you should only dedicate it to the country and the nation. At the very least, even if you want to sigh and complain, you should look at those who are more unfortunate than you and sigh and complain on their behalf, because you have a pen and don't have to worry about opportunities, while they have nothing. If you don't help them, no one will. Therefore, I hope you use fewer trivial matters around you as material. The above are my words to young literary people with new hobbies. Of course, this is just my personal limited view, and there are many places that need to be supplemented or discussed further. Due to space limitations, I can only leave it at that for now.

### General Lu

— Shengdan

— War Zone Notes

After Lao Tai went to Ruichang with the army, Jianxiong had to leave for Xianning soon because his vacation was over, and I, having arrived in Hankou from Lu'an, had to return to the Dabie Mountains to continue the work I was supposed to do. At this time, the battle around Wu'ao had entered a critical stage, but because I had arranged to meet General Lu Han, I had to delay my departure to see the demeanor of the famous Yunnan army general. Moreover, he had made special contributions in the Battle of Taierzhuang, and I felt it was necessary to meet him in order to collect some valuable historical materials. So, although I was ready to leave, I did not immediately say goodbye to Wuhan. At the same time, the defense area he was in charge of this time happened to be at the end of the Yuehan Railway in Hunan Province. If the Three Towns were to be swallowed up, then he would bear a great responsibility in the western Hubei area. Therefore, my departure date for returning to the Dabie Mountains was extended by two weeks.

I remember it was a day of very heavy air raids. Several more deep pools were added to the Hanyang Airport. Fortunately, the soil was unlucky and flew around for no reason. They always use the things they get from "taxing the people to the fullest" to fight with the soil, which really feels like a waste. Therefore, friends who came back from the war zone all showed an indifferent attitude towards bombings. After the air raid alarm was lifted, the phone rang: "General Lu is waiting for you at Dingyuli in Hunan Street. Please come immediately. He is going to cross the river this afternoon!" It was Director Peng of the Political Training Department speaking, with a heavy Yunnan accent.

When I arrived at Dingyuli, the first people I saw were several young girls from the Yunnan Women's War Zone Work Team. During my previous visit, I had become quite familiar with them. But what gift did I have? None at all; all I had was a respectful greeting.

When I met General Lu, his "gentle and refined" demeanor made me wonder if he was a scholar, or perhaps a university professor? His orderly conversation was like that of a "eloquent" diplomat. He talked about their breakout from Xuzhou and the long journey of over seven hundred li on foot, without any fatigue, just like the female students from Anhui University's War Zone Work Team that I saw in Huayang, full of energy. "Santa Claus is here, you must have brought some gifts!" The girls really knew how to joke. My conversation with them lasted for two hours before it finally stopped. The topic, of course, was the past Battle of Taierzhuang. Finally, he said, "When we triumph in the future, let's meet at the Yellow Crane Tower!"

With a sincere smile, I shook hands with General Lu and said goodbye.

### Light is Already in Sight

— Liu Zenghui

### Plea

— Qian Changnian

It is not a low groan, nor is it a wind-like wail, but the tears of our millions of people, flowing into a sea, and from this sea comes a sound like a giant wave. These millions of suffering hearts of ours—perhaps the most unfortunate. Those whose fates are governed by different fortunes never think of these hearts that have only suffered. Who knows the deep pain sometimes inflicted upon our hearts, making us forget that our bodies are also wandering helplessly? Who gives us the friendship of love? That is a dream! They ultimately have their own fortunes, sometimes casting a glance of sincere sympathy upon us for a moment, but after turning their heads, they love their own fortunes even more deeply. To whom can we turn to plead? Truth has hidden itself in the deep valleys, having long forgotten this group of us!

We are forced to act out tragedies. Will truth give us a bit of light? There must be a ray of light in the darkness. As long as it can give us a bit of hope, we can go and seek it.

Why have our homes become piles of rubble? We did not excessively enjoy ourselves in them. Why has shapeless flesh and blood stained our rice fields? Why has our beloved child been taken away, he will no longer cry for milk when he is hungry, no longer intimately snuggle in my arms and shout "fear?" Why must tears drip onto my own severed arm that I am tightly holding?

Truth, please illuminate this world again, do not lightly abandon this group of countless suffering people. Give us a ray of hope!

Wandering aimlessly, without a home, a wandering that seems to have no seasons, when the fierce summer sun mercilessly shines down, sweat soaking through our ragged clothes that never dry. There are also big houses there, but we dare not set foot inside, because they do not need truth. The days slip away like this forever, the seasons are not kind to us. The biting cold wind wraps around our bodies in the harsh winter, and we still wear the same torn clothes we wore in the summer. Although our bodies are frozen, there is still a conscious heart that has not frozen to death, and this heart is forever marked with a question—'Is this the verdict of truth?'

Heaven! This is not a curse, because perhaps this is fate. Looking at that bright and warm place, but we do not have the courage to knock on the door. Who would bother to listen to our lament? Which door would accommodate us, these homeless wanderers? Even if the wind blows down this body that cannot withstand hunger and cold, in the eyes of others, it may be no more than a dog that has frozen to death!

Who has ever witnessed the blood of their own aged parents staining a sharp blade? Lying in the rubble, groaning in pain? Their hearts were just as loving towards their children as other people's parents, but they encountered a situation contrary to reason and compassion. They never complained that their children were not as good as others, but in their hearts at the moment of eternal farewell, they still held a thought, deeply fearing that their children suffering on this bloody ground would encounter even more cruel devastation!

Whenever we pray for the coming of truth, we feel something stuck in our throats, as if the blood in our hearts is dripping down. Our deep voices turn into trembling sobs. What more suffering awaits us? Yet we do not expect to die. Perhaps when we reach the end of suffering, we will finally be saved. Enduring the pain, harboring this hope: behind the layers of dark clouds hides the sun, and darkness will eventually be driven out of the world!

### Learning to Cry

— Gu Chu

It seems someone once said, "Crying is a sign of weakness." Yes, when two children fight, the weaker one will inevitably lose, and when they lose, they will inevitably cry. From this, we can also prove that "crying is a sign of weakness" is correct, so why should we "learn" it?

However, clever people say: crying is a method of being human, a secret to success. Their reasoning is that "everyone has a heart of compassion," and the way to touch other people's compassion is to "cry." They also cite a large number of successful people, like Liu Xuande, like Shen Baoxu, like...etc., to prove that "crying" is the secret to success. Since "crying" is the secret to success, its importance is obvious, and how can one not "learn" it? But how to learn? And how to "put it to use" after learning? Let's give some examples to clarify:

For example: You see that the hearts of people in society are not as they used to be, and the social atmosphere is deteriorating. So you give a speech in public on the methods to remedy this, but you must shed a few tears; or publish an article, but in the article, you must not omit the words "alas"—or, to be more Westernized, use "oh"—then people will be moved and give you the title of "moralist." When you encounter refugees on the street asking you for money, you can turn your head and walk away—the faster you walk, the better; but when you return to your mansion, you must "ping ping ze ze" write a few ancient or modern poems of "mourning the refugees" or "crying for fellow compatriots," and use a classic quote such as "Behind vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road lie the bones of those who have starved to death," and publish it in a newspaper or magazine. Then people will call you a "poet elder" and give you the title of "philanthropist." If your parents or other elders in your family die, you can watch movies or hold dancing girls, but the most important thing is that in the "obituary" or "announcement of mourning," you must not omit the words "weeping blood" or "shedding tears," even if you feel no pain in your heart. But when you meet friends, your eyes must be as red as blood, and when you speak, your voice must be slightly trembling. Then people will still say that you are able to "grieve to the point of emaciation" and crown you with the title of "filial son." Similarly, when talking about national affairs, you must cry bitterly, or sob uncontrollably, to show that your "love for the country does not lag behind others." Therefore, people will still crown you with the title of "patriot"...

If you don't want titles, then is there no place to use crying? Well, there are other uses.

For example: If you want to borrow money from someone, you must wear a mournful face (if you can really cry, that's even better, but if you can't, at least show some crying expression), then people will believe that you really have no money and are truly poor. Otherwise, you will definitely be turned away and hit a wall. If you fail a class in school, you just need to go to the teacher and wail loudly, preferably with tears streaming down your face, explaining the reasons why you failed. Then you can pass and be promoted. If you quarrel with your husband, or fight and suffer losses, then you just need to "cry," "cry" at the ancestral altar, for an hour, two hours, a day, two days...then your husband will definitely be impressed and fall at your feet under your short cheongsam, obeying your every command.

Since the way of crying came into being, it has spread from one to ten, ten to a hundred, and everyone is vying to emulate it, each using their ingenuity, creating a chilling and ghostly atmosphere. Therefore, I picked up my pen and judged:

"The way of being a human lies in deception, the way of deception lies in crying. The clever people do not die, and the chaos does not stop!"

Spring and Autumn

### Outdoor Summer Concerts Organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council Music Band

— Zhang Zhenshan

Starting June 1st and Ending August 31st, Stages and Seats are Being Actively Arranged in Various Parks

The early summer monsoon brings information about the summer heat, covering the city with a summer coat, making all life's movements flow into the summer rapids. Cold drinks and swimming pools have begun to become active; all moving and still things are changing regularly with the shift of seasons.

The outdoor summer concerts organized annually by the Shanghai Municipal Council Music Band are now ready and will begin playing on June 1st ahead of schedule. Originally, it was customary to start on July 1st and end at the end of September. Starting a month earlier this year, this correction of the time arrangement is indeed very appropriate, because the number of visitors to the park in June is gradually increasing, while the number of park visitors in September is decreasing.

It is not yet the hottest day, and the parks in France, Béthune Park, Zhao Feng Park, the Bund Park, and Jiaozhou Park are already extremely crowded, especially the crowds wandering around in the afternoon. If we calculate the ratio of the five million citizens to the area of these few parks, it is indeed not enough. Therefore, in the "isolated island," in the season when people need to let out some heat, as long as there is some artificially decorated greenery, there will inevitably be a phenomenon of being full to the brim. It seems that open-air concerts can be held in any park this summer, but because of the equipment and location, there are only four locations where they can be played: Zhao Feng Park, the Bund Park, France Park, and the French Association. But France Park and the French Association are only separated by a low wall, so in fact, there are only three locations. Now it is stipulated that from June 1, brass music will be played every Wednesday and Thursday in France Park; every Friday in the Bund Park; and every Tuesday and Saturday in Zhao Feng Park.

Starting June 14, in addition to the above brass concerts as usual, orchestral music will also be played from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM at the following two locations:—every Thursday at the French Association; every Monday and Saturday at Zhao Feng Park.

The park bureaus are now actively arranging and scrubbing the performance stage and seats. Except that Zhao Feng Park has a ready-made semi-circular bandstand, and the Bund Park also has a ready-made hexagonal pavilion, the performance stage in France Park is temporarily built with foreign pine wood planks under the large trees in the middle of the park; the performance stage of the French Association is to use the original terrace in front of the building, covered with blue cloth.

When the open-air concerts are played, in addition to the park tickets, you also need to buy additional tickets. Tickets for orchestral concerts are divided into two types: one yuan and fifty cents; brass concerts do not sell tickets, but rent for canvas lounge chairs, charging twenty cents per person.

Based on past situations and experience, because most of the music played is famous songs from European and Western countries, most Chinese people, except for a small number who have researched music art, do not understand the kind of rhythm, music theory, nature, origin of the music, literary value, and the technology of its performance. They only use its sound to regulate the monotony and loneliness of their hearing. The so-called artistic and poetic appreciation has not yet become universal and popular, so the audience is not as crowded as for low-level song and dance, and even rows of lounge chairs are empty, which is equivalent to being set up in vain. From this, we can see the general public's degree of appreciation for musical art.

However, on the other hand, in terms of the principle of saving consumption, it is advisable to listen while sitting on the grass without spending money, because the sound is no different from listening while lying on a chair, and you do not have to be restricted by your position, you can move freely. Moreover, it is not necessary to spend money to be considered to understand musical art! As long as you have free time, you can listen to your heart's content every afternoon or evening within two months without spending any money!

### A Note on the Aurora Museum

— Lanyan

With Various Insect Hatching Processes and Specimens of Colorful Butterflies, it is the Crystallization of French Priests' Efforts

The intellectual classes, who are buried in a world of eroticism, rarely visit museums or other places for academic research. To put it bluntly, how many people can often go to the library to smell the scent of books?

Someone said that Chinese science is not progressing. I say that at the very least, we must change the living environment of Shanghai people.

Regarding museums, I know that there are two in total in the Shanghai concessions, one is the museum on Museum Road, and the other is the museum attached to Aurora University.

Before the Shanghai War, the Shanghai Municipal Government spent a lot of money to build a museum, and held an exhibition of architectural styles of past dynasties, with detailed explanations and introductions to the greatness of ancient buildings.

Now, this museum is buried in smoke and rubble, which is indeed a source of endless vicissitudes.

Regarding the Aurora Museum, I had broken the rules and visited it once before it was open. The day before yesterday, they held their 70th anniversary ceremony, and the various specimens collected were particularly rich.

Now, I will write down a little bit of material that has not been recorded in the various newspapers:

From this 70-year-old Aurora Museum, we can also see that the energy that religious scholars have put into China is indeed amazing. Starting with the founder, Father Heude, and continuing through Fathers Le Doré, Père Heude, Père Blanc, Père Sicard, to the current person in charge, Father Zheng, they have worked tirelessly and continuously, overcoming many hardships and struggles, to collect so many valuable specimens.

These many priests specialize in collecting one or two types of specimens. For example, Father Le Doré's collection of deer specimens is the richest in the Far East (now there are a total of 3,675 types); the founder, Father Heude, traveled around the earth almost seven times in order to collect various specimens; and now, he has left China with many precious "Chinese Natural History" works. These works have made great contributions to those who study natural science in China. There is also Father Blanc, who specializes in the study of plants, and Father Sicard, who specializes in collecting insects.

The entire museum has three floors. The bottom floor is for antiques and bronzes, which I visited before; the second floor is for plant specimens and animal specimens; and the third floor is for insect, shell, and bird specimens.

Among the insect specimens, there are many various kinds of insects and ants that you have never seen before, and the processes of how they live and hatch. For example, a small bamboo tube is the perfect place for a small insect to hatch; a piece of soil is the perfect home for another type of insect. These specimens are all living, step by step showing their nests and changes.

In particular, many colorful butterfly specimens are really extremely beautiful. These insects, which represent the colors of nature, are worth lingering over.

Among the birds, there are even more exquisite specimens, such as a tiny bird, how it arranges its nest in a branch and a bamboo tube, and how it hatches its eggs.

After visiting this Aurora Museum, which includes hundreds of thousands of specimens of animals, plants, and insects, people feel the greatness and beauty of nature even more.

This museum is open to the public for two weeks starting yesterday. After two weeks, there may be a small fee to enter.

### Letter to the Editor: Request for Change in Class Time at the Shanghai Eastside Community Center

— Respectfully Submitted by Xu Jie

To the Esteemed Editor:

I am an apprentice in a shop and also a reader of your esteemed newspaper. A few days ago, I saw a news item in your paper about the apprentice night school being opened at the Shanghai Eastside Community Center. Now I have a small request and dare to borrow a corner of your publication to ask the gentlemen who founded the school to kindly consider adopting it.

To the Esteemed Gentlemen of the Shanghai Eastside Community Center: Greetings. Due to my family's financial constraints, I became an apprentice at a shop in this port at the age of fourteen through a friend's introduction. Time flies, and it has been over two years already. In the past, I very much wanted to find an opportunity to improve my knowledge, but due to various reasons, I have never been able to fulfill this wish. Now that such an opportunity exists, of course, I cannot let it pass lightly. I am very gratified, thinking that my long-cherished wish of several years can be fulfilled. However, the early hour gives me pause. Shops in Shanghai generally open around 7:00 AM and close at 9:00 PM. If I were to ask the shop owner for leave to attend school every day before 9:00 PM, it would be quite impossible. But to miss such a good opportunity is unbearable, so I dare to venture to state my case and earnestly request that the class time be changed to 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM every night. If you would be so kind as to grant my request, I would be grateful beyond words. I eagerly await your reply in the newspaper as to whether or not you will grant it. With best wishes for your well-being.

### England and the Soviet Union

— Fo

Assuming any one of England, France, or the Soviet Union engages in war with the German-Italian Axis, the other two are highly likely to be drawn into the vortex.

However, it is also a natural course of events that any one of England, France, or the Soviet Union is unwilling to be the first to clash with Germany and Italy, so as to avoid significant sacrifices.

The fact that the anti-aggression front between England and the Soviet Union cannot be resolved smoothly at the moment reflects this mentality. However, the end result, compelled by the environment, is that there is no alternative but to follow this path of peaceful co-existence.

### After the Rain, Clear Skies

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Ten: Simple Hairdo and Blue Skirt, a Virtuous and Good Mother; White Beard and Emerald Sleeves, a Vigorous Old Man

He Liyu asked, "Is that Mrs. Xu, the village chief, right now?" Village Chief Zhu said, "Isn't it? Later on, this old man and young woman actually formed this couple. So, before Old Man Xu's family property was completely dissipated, people thought that Xie Ayu's marriage to him was to covet his property. After the old man died, she could sweep away everything and leave. Even if Xie Ayu didn't have this intention, people would often suspect her. Now that Old Man Xu's family property has been donated entirely, people have nothing to say. Old Man Xu also feels that Xie Ayu's marriage to him came from genuine affection. Just imagine, an old man in his seventies, without anyone to support him, it's very inconvenient, right? Who knew that after they got married, in less than three years, they had a fair, chubby child, which was really unexpected beyond expectations. Not only did others find it unexpected, but the old man and young wife themselves also found it unexpected! In the past, Chinese wealthy people often had money but no sons. A group of poor people, however, had sons. These are two old sayings. Who knew that this Old Man Xu, initially had money but no sons. But later, when he had no money, he suddenly had a son. Therefore, some people even said that it was destined by fate. Now this child is already six years old. Old Man Xu was seventy-seven years old when he had him, which can be considered having a son in old age. Old Man Xu gave him a name, a single character 'Chi' (遲, late), meaning that he came too late. But after all, he is still his son, what does it matter? Children nowadays are more fortunate the later they are born." He Liyu said, "Having a child at seventy-seven years old is indeed rare, and moreover, they never had children before, so they must be overjoyed." Zhu Airen said, "Men are different from women. Women after their reproductive years cannot do anything. Men don't care, as long as their partner can still bear children. I heard from our old Doctor Zhang that we used to have a Mr. Feng Menghua who had a son at eighty-two years old. Because China has always had a system of concubines, old men take young concubines. As long as their energy hasn't waned and they meet the conditions for reproduction, of course, they can have children. I've seen Village Chief Xu a few times. Although he's over eighty years old, his body is still strong and healthy, clearly a long-lived man!" Zhu Aiqun said, "I know Village Chief Xu's family matters very well. Because his wife was delivered by me. People say: old people often return to their childhood, and Village Chief Xu is really like a child, completely listening to his wife's instructions." (116)

### Reflections on "In the Dead of Winter"

— Qi Hua

“Let Us Live”

Produced by Columbia Pictures, Shown in Nanjing

After watching "In the Dead of Winter," I couldn't help but think of Paul Muni's "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," and I also remembered an article published in a certain newspaper at the time of the film's release, "Law is Nothing More Than Human Sentiment." Yes, a person who has established many businesses for society and has a considerable position in society, who was a fugitive in the past, the law that protects human rights still impartially deprives him of his freedom. So "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is not so much an exposé of the darkness of the penitentiary, but rather the playwright's skepticism towards the law.

In "In the Dead of Winter," the taxi driver Brick is mistaken for a robber by the original owner, and because his lover Mary cannot provide evidence that he was indeed standing outside the church at the time of the robbery, he is sentenced to death under the "unanimous condemnation, no room for defense" law. The reason why the playwright created such a story is not like other films about wrongful convictions, with tortuous and bizarre plots, and finally discovering the real culprit at the last moment, to stimulate the audience; here, he also, like "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," holds a skeptical attitude towards the law and some satire towards the disregard for human life by law enforcers. For example, after Detective Ewart discovered the bullet, he was convinced that Brick was wrongly accused and earnestly asked the prosecutor to postpone the execution, but the prosecutor's reply was "This is not my job." Also, when the detective and Mary went to New York to find out the real culprit and asked the police station for assistance, they were refused because the procedures were not met. Finally, Brick "gets his name cleared on a snowy night," and when the prosecutor declares to him upon his release, "This is my duty," Brick refuses his request to shake hands and thanks the detective instead, walking out proudly. These all clearly show the playwright's intent. Therefore, Let Us Live cannot be solved merely by a child (who discovered the robber's car) and the detective's efforts. Here, law enforcers should do their best to carefully examine the case, collect evidence, and give the defendant ample time to present counter-evidence, so as to reduce the occurrence of wrongful convictions (of course, it would be better if there were absolutely none); at the same time, the law is a dead thing, and how to weigh the pros and cons and incorporate "human sentiment" in special circumstances is something that legal scholars need to study.

The director's handling of this film is also quite lovely. He makes the emotions of each scene fully develop, and the editing is tight, and the photographer also contributes a lot. For example, in the two robberies, the photographer used strong and weak light to help create a tense atmosphere.

As for Henry Fonda, I agree with Mr. Li Zhihua's opinion that his portrayal of the taxi driver is very calm and powerful, and his passionate scenes with Maureen O'Sullivan are reminiscent of Charles Farrell in "Seventh Heaven." The performances of Maureen O'Sullivan (Mary) and Ralph Bellamy (Detective) are also not weak.

### Analysis of the Recent Depreciation of the Japanese Yen in Shanghai

— Shi Yiwen

Since the "Huaxing Bank" opened on the 16th of this month, those who are unaware of the inside story have been uneasy, thinking that the value of the legal tender will suffer a major pressure, and the financial market in Shanghai will inevitably be affected. However, up to now, the facts have shown us that the value of the legal tender has not changed in the slightest, and the financial market in Shanghai has not shown any unstable phenomena, proving that the worries caused by the establishment of the "Huaxing Bank" are just the worries of ordinary people.

In fact, looking at the actual situation of the Shanghai financial market at present, it is not China's legal tender that is affected by the establishment of the "Huaxing Bank," but the Japanese yen itself. A few days before the opening of the "Huaxing Bank" (May 13), the black market exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the legal tender was 100 yen to 102 yuan of legal tender; but since the 16th (the opening day of the Huaxing Bank), the Japanese yen has fallen to the same price as the legal tender, and today (May 20), it has fallen to only 95 yuan of legal tender. (See today's newspaper) In this week, the Japanese yen has depreciated by more than eight yuan against the legal tender, and this downward trend may continue to develop in the future.

The depreciation of the Japanese yen did not start today. I remember that in June and July of last year, the market price of the Japanese yen in the open market was about 30% higher than that of the legal tender (i.e., 100 yen could be exchanged for about 130 yuan of legal tender). By September, it had dropped to 20% (i.e., 100 yen could be exchanged for 120 yuan of legal tender), and by January and February of this year, it had dropped to 10% (i.e., 100 yen could be exchanged for 110 yuan of legal tender). Recently, it has fallen below the parity with the legal tender. If converted using British exchange, in September of last year, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen had fallen from its benchmark exchange rate (one shilling and two pence) to ten pence, by January and February of this year, it had fallen to nine pence, and recently it has fallen to about seven pence. This continuous downward trend of the Japanese yen is certainly not an accidental phenomenon, but has its objective reasons. It is worthy of our research.

In September of last year, when the depreciation of the Japanese yen was at its most severe, I wrote an article for Wenhui Bao (see the economic special issue of the newspaper on September 20), pointing out the reasons for its depreciation. I am excerpting a section of it for reference:

"Since the outbreak of the war in 1937, no less than 200 million yen of Japanese banknotes have flowed into China. Among them, 150 million yen flowed into North China (mostly banknotes of the Bank of Korea), and 50 million yen flowed into the Jiangnan war zone (mostly banknotes of the Bank of Japan). The source of these banknotes is partly the funds used by the Japanese army to procure military supplies in the war zone, and mostly the salaries of Japanese soldiers fighting in China. In February and March (last year), as much as 50 million yen had flowed into Shanghai. By May and June, some speculators used legal tender in Shanghai to buy Japanese yen in North China, so Japanese yen from North China poured southwards, and Shanghai became a place where Japanese yen was rampant. The number of Japanese yen in Shanghai has increased. If it were possible to freely purchase foreign exchange, then its value would naturally not be a problem. However, under the strict management of the Japanese government, if one wants to purchase more than 100 yen of foreign exchange, one must apply for approval, and the conditions are very harsh. Not only that, but Japanese banks in Shanghai also refuse to accept transactions (such as documentary bills) that use Japanese yen to pay for the price of goods exported from Japan. (The purpose is to restrict the export of goods without foreign exchange) The environment in which the Japanese yen in Shanghai is located is like this, and the actual need for it in the Shanghai market is not great, so it has become a paralyzed currency, and its value is naturally unavoidable."

The above is the general reason for the depreciation of the Japanese yen in September of last year, but what is the situation of the current depreciation of the Japanese yen? First, let me introduce the Japanese side's own explanation.

The Japanese believe that the biggest reasons for the current depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai are the following three points: First, it is the result of restrictions on the import of soybeans and soybean oil from Northeast and North China into Central China. In the past, the value of soybeans and soybean oil imported from Northeast and North China to Shanghai was about 2 to 3 million yuan per month. Currently, since Shanghai no longer imports such goods, Shanghai will have an excess of 2 to 3 million yen per month; the excess of yen funds in Shanghai will naturally cause the value of the Japanese yen to fall.

Second, the number of Japanese people coming to China has increased sharply, and Japanese yen has also been brought in large quantities. According to statistics for April, a total of 8,350 Japanese people came to Shanghai. If each person brings an average of 500 Japanese yen, then 4 million Japanese yen will flow into Shanghai in one month, and 50 million yen in one year. In the Shanghai financial market, which has no Japanese yen status, it is naturally very difficult to accommodate such a huge amount of funds. This will inevitably affect the exchange rate.

Third, Japan has restricted the export of goods to Central China, reducing the need for Japanese yen. Due to the reduction in the supply of Japanese goods in the occupied areas, the people in the occupied areas will naturally use the military tickets issued by Japan to transport them to Shanghai, exchange them for Japanese yen, and then exchange the Japanese yen for legal tender, so as to purchase the necessary materials from foreign or Chinese merchants with legal tender. Therefore, the result of the large demand for legal tender by the people in the occupied areas will naturally put pressure on the Japanese yen and cause it to depreciate. (See the Shanghai Daily News on May 19)

We also acknowledge that the above three situations are indeed the reasons for the current depreciation of the Japanese yen, but they are only superficial reasons, derived reasons. Fundamentally, it is the issue of Japan's national strength. In other words, it is the issue of the purchasing power of the Japanese yen. We know that since Japan launched the war against China, its military expenditures have reached as much as 10 billion yen. The consumption of military expenses is actually the consumption of material resources, which is also the consumption of national strength. If Japan's productivity is sufficient to adapt to the huge military consumption, then it would not be a problem for the Japanese government to mobilize the materials needed for the war through financial institutions. However, everyone knows that Japan's productivity is very fragile. Not only has it failed to supplement the materials needed for the war due to the massive consumption of the war, but also due to the massive consumption of material resources and manpower in the war, it has become increasingly unable to make ends meet in its productivity, and has entered a state of exhaustion. Now the Japanese government is only relying on the method of draining the pond to catch all the fish, issuing more banknotes and creating new purchasing power to requisition the savings of the people and maintain its external war. Looking at the amount of Japanese yen banknotes issued, it has increased from 15 billion yen in June 1937 to about 25 billion yen at present. (It once increased to 29 billion yen at the end of last year) In the twenty months after the war, the amount of new purchasing power (banknotes) has increased by almost one time compared with before the war, while its domestic materials (including savings and productivity) have not increased with the quantity of the forged purchasing power (in fact, it is decreasing). Therefore, the relative balance between purchasing power and materials has been lost. What is expressed domestically is the soaring of prices, and what is expressed abroad is the depreciation of the Japanese yen exchange rate.

The current depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai is also evidence of the reduction in its purchasing power. However, the depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai is not only against the legal tender (because the value of the legal tender has not changed), but also against all foreign currencies. However, in addition to the above-mentioned reasons for the reduction in purchasing power, there are two other reasons for the depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai that cannot be ignored:

First: The recent depreciation of the puppet United Reserve Bank of North China has caused the Japanese yen to depreciate as well. The depreciation of the puppet United Reserve Bank is due to the fact that the puppet government of North China and the Japanese army need it in finance, so they issue it indiscriminately. Also, half of it is due to the people's fear of the value of the puppet United Reserve Bank, so they exchange it for goods (or legal tender). Because of the parity relationship between the puppet United Reserve Bank and the Japanese yen, the value of the Japanese yen is also lowered. Therefore, some speculators (including Japanese) use legal tender to buy Japanese yen in North China, and then transport the Japanese yen to Shanghai to buy legal tender, which makes the Japanese yen in Shanghai even more needed for the legal tender, and pressures its value to fall.

Second: The plan to issue banknotes by the "Huaxing Bank" will inevitably reduce the actual need for Japanese yen; at the same time, because the banknotes of the "Huaxing Bank" have no real reserves, they will inevitably depreciate due to indiscriminate issuance in the future (just like the situation of the puppet United Reserve Bank of North China). Japan knew this consequence early on, so it declared that the "Huaxing Bank notes" would not be linked to the Japanese yen, which is tantamount to reflecting the emptiness of the Japanese yen's foundation. Therefore, most people (including Japanese) dare not collect Japanese yen, but would rather exchange it for legal tender with a stable value (or buy goods), which makes the value of the legal tender relatively higher, and makes the value of the Japanese yen fall step by step.

The above two reasons are so powerful in promoting the depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai precisely because the purchasing power of the Japanese yen has been fundamentally reduced. It can also be said to be the result of inflation. Therefore, what is expressed by this is not only the shaking of the external credit of the Japanese yen, but also the significant losses suffered by Japan in the war against China. If the war against China cannot be ended, then the consumption of Japan's national strength will definitely increase day by day, and the purchasing power of the Japanese yen will also deteriorate day by day. The result of the deterioration of the purchasing power of the Japanese yen will not only make it difficult to maintain the war, but also promote the total collapse of its entire national economy. The current continuous depreciation of the Japanese yen shows that Japan is already on the road to total collapse. On the contrary: the current stability of the value of the legal tender and the relative increase in value against the Japanese yen are proof of the correctness of China's strategy of protracted attrition warfare, indicating that China has already moved towards a dominant position in the military, and the final victory is not a problem.

### "Huaxing Bank" and the Shanghai Market

— Xinhai

The so-called "Huaxing Commercial Bank" has a negligible impact on the Shanghai market; although there are rumors in the market, as long as ordinary people do not disturb themselves, "Huaxing" cannot do anything about it.

However, when the news of the establishment of "Huaxing" came out, the forward exchange rate of the legal tender once tightened, which was probably due to the fact that the market was not calm at first and did not fully understand it; and when it recognized its nature and tricks, it immediately stabilized as usual. However, on the day of its opening on the 16th, various unfounded rumors were spread again from nowhere, causing the sensitive market to be foolishly manipulated once again; the black market price of public bonds suddenly dropped as a result. The rumors I heard are roughly in four categories:

1. It is said that in order to resist "Huaxing's" attempt to seize legal tender, the National Government plans to replace the legal tender of five yuan or more with banknotes bearing a chop, leaving only small denominations of currency below one yuan in circulation in the market. Only banknotes bearing a chop can be used to purchase foreign exchange in the future.

2. It is said that the National Government will henceforth make all principal and interest payments on public bonds in Chongqing, no longer using the method of "paying in Chongqing once and paying in Shanghai in six installments," in order to reduce the inflow of legal tender funds into Shanghai.

3. It is said that the legal tender of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications will be gradually withdrawn, allowing the banknotes and miscellaneous currencies issued by the remaining eight legal commercial banks to circulate, and these non-Central, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications banknotes will not be eligible to purchase foreign exchange.

4. It is said that the existing legal tender foreign exchange stabilization fund will be divided among China, Britain, and the United States, and will only be supplied to China, Britain, and the United States. Ordinary needs will not be supplied for the time being.

These rumors caused some people in the market to be impulsive, which is really too lacking in judgment. First of all, the wise authorities would never take this inferior strategy of undermining the credibility of the legal tender. Because, if only banknotes with a chop are allowed to purchase foreign exchange, then the legal tender to banknotes with a chop will inevitably be at a discount. The legal tender at a discount is no different from the depreciation of the legal tender; moreover, the legal tender can still purchase foreign exchange after paying the discount and obtaining banknotes with a chop. How can the attempt of the pseudo "Huaxing" to absorb legal tender and seize foreign exchange be prevented simply by adding a procedure of converting to banknotes with a chop? Presumably, this rumor originated from the discount of the banknotes with a chop of foreign merchant banks. Foreign merchant banks use banknotes with a chop to avoid the complexity of legal tender calculations, but this cannot be regarded as the circulation of banknotes with a chop.

The second point is equally ridiculous. Even if the National Government wants to shrink the legal tender in the war zone, it does not need to harp on this old tune. Moreover, the government has always been determined to maintain its debt credibility; it will not revoke its previous promise, and the government can certainly restrict the flow of legal tender to Shanghai from other aspects. Why must it plan on the payment of principal and interest on public bonds?

The third point is also impossible. If the government withdraws the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, and allows miscellaneous currencies to circulate, wouldn't it be tantamount to the government slapping itself in the face? The banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are legal tender, and those issued by other commercial banks are also legal tender. The former can purchase foreign exchange, while the latter cannot. Isn't this destroying the already unified currency system? Even in the Tianjin concession, there will never be a withdrawal of legal tender. On the contrary, when funds from North China fled south in droves, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Tianjin restricted Shanghai exchange in order to maintain the original circulation of legal tender in North China. Because if the legal tender is withdrawn, there will be no currency available for circulation in the concession, and then the pseudo-currency can take the opportunity to seize the circulation area of the legal tender. Would the government be so stupid?

Finally, everyone knows that the establishment of the legal tender stabilization fund is to stabilize the external value of the legal tender. Therefore, anyone who holds legal tender, whether they are Chinese merchants, British merchants, etc., can purchase foreign exchange if necessary. The holders of legal tender do have nationalities, but the value of legal tender is definitely not different due to the different nationalities of the holders. Therefore, it is not worth a knowledgeable person's smile to say that the legal tender stabilization fund will be divided among the three countries. There are many ways to prevent the inflow into the pseudo "Huaxing"! For example, not allowing inland products to fall into the hands of the Japanese puppets and not buying Japanese goods are all ways.

In fact, even without the above analysis, the stability of the market today and the recovery of various bonds can prove the incredibility of these rumors.

### China's Cotton Industry Since the Start of the War (Translated from the "Millard's Review")

— Boming

The published figures for the losses and damages suffered by Chinese textile mills, especially yarn mills, during the Sino-Japanese War are truly alarming. The work stoppages and destruction of factory equipment have an even greater impact on the welfare and prosperity of capitalists and workers, because the textile industry in China is an important industry that employs more labor and invests more capital than any other industry. The information we have obtained from various organizations, textile mill managers, foreign agencies, and custodians, or from various parties related to these textile mills, can be reliably trusted.

However, there are also some factory buildings that have been used by the Japanese army as military hospitals or general headquarters. Except for the Japanese, no one is allowed to enter. Therefore, the actual situation of these textile mills is almost impossible to know for sure. Only a rough estimate of the degree of damage to the buildings can be made. Regarding the machinery inside, it is difficult to know for sure. According to various sources, the Japanese army has transported the machinery and motors of Chinese yarn mills in the occupied areas of Shanghai to Qingdao and installed them in Japanese yarn mills.

The current situation of Chinese yarn mills can be divided into the following categories:

(1) Twenty-six mills have been forcibly taken over by the Japanese army and are now being operated by the Japanese army for their own benefit, with 681,960 spindles, 42,950 doubling spindles, and 6,244 looms.

The yarn mills in the three provinces of Lu, Jin, and Yu have all been taken over and are used to weave military uniforms or as military machine repair shops. These confiscated factories only employ Chinese coolies and ordinary workers. Some Chinese yarn mills managed and operated by foreigners have also been taken over. For example, the Dasheng Yarn Mills No. 1, 3, and 8, operated by the German company Arnhold & Co., were forcibly taken over on March 3 this year. Although the German embassy has been negotiating with the Japanese side, there has been no result so far. In short, the Chinese-owned yarn mills forcibly taken over by the Japanese side account for about one-quarter of the total number of spindles.

(2) Some or severely damaged, and now being repaired by the Japanese, 8,007 looms.

Most of these textile mills are in Jiangsu Province outside the Shanghai Concession area. Chinese textile mills in Wuxi and Changzhou are completely included in this category.

(3) Five textile mills have been occupied by the Japanese army as military hospitals and general headquarters, with 276,830 spindles, 44,266 doubling spindles, and 2,115 looms.

Most of these textile mills are around Shanghai. The No. 1, 2, and 3 mills of Wing On Textile Co., Ltd., have all been occupied, and people of any nationality are not allowed to enter.

(4) Fifteen textile mills are operating normally in the Shanghai Concession area and areas where no war has occurred, with 437,562 spindles, 34,898 doubling spindles, and 2,610 looms.

Most of these textile mills are in the center of the Shanghai International Settlement and in the two provinces of Shaanxi and Yunnan, and have made huge profits since the start of the war.

(5) Five textile mills (including one large dyeing and weaving mill) are operated by the Japanese side, ostensibly according to the so-called Sino-Japanese cooperation plan, i.e., the Japanese get 51% of the net profit and the Chinese get 49%, with 42,328 spindles, 7,980 doubling spindles, and 1,500 looms.

The managers of these textile mills have compromised with the Japanese side and have made some secret arrangements. Three of them are in Shanghai, one is in Wuhu, Anhui Province, and one is in Tangshan, Hebei Province.

(6) Eleven textile mills have moved some of their machinery to inland cities such as Chongqing and Xi'an and to the Shanghai International Settlement, with 315,162 spindles, 5,600 doubling spindles, and 2,293 looms.

Most of these relocated textile mills have changed their names, and many are registered under foreign names or are operated by the Bank of China.

(7) The machinery of the No. 1 Hubei Yarn Mill, now including 88,160 spindles and 648 looms, is stored in a foreign warehouse in Hankou. The mill is currently in the custody of the British company Tolly & Co.

(8) Eight textile mills are currently shut down in less favorable central locations within the Japanese-occupied area due to frequent attacks by Chinese mobile units or difficulties in transportation and communication, with 172,044 spindles, 8,400 variable spindles, and 920 looms.

The Hengda Yarn Mill in Pudong is said to be shut down due to the activity of Chinese mobile units, and other textile mills on the outskirts of Shanghai are also shut down for the same reason.

(9) Textile mills that were shut down during the war and have resumed operation since last year include: Chongxin in Zhabei, registered under British name, and Ewo Cotton Mill in Yangshupu district.

(10) The following textile mills are said to have had their machinery transported out by the Japanese side: Hengfeng Textile Company, Shenxin Yarn Mill No. 7, registered under a British name, Dahua Dyeing and Weaving Company, all of the above are in Yangshupu, and Zhentai Yarn Mill in Zhabei registered under British name.

(11) The following mills have been opened in Shanghai since the war: Anda Textile Company, 15,000 spindles, Zhongfang Company, 26,000 spindles and 300 looms, China Yarn Mill, 15,000 spindles (all of the above are registered under British names), Guomian Yarn Manufacturing Company, 26,000 spindles, Defang Textile Company, 10,340 spindles and 128 looms, (all of the above are registered under American names), Rongfeng Yarn Mill, 10,000 spindles, and Feng Textile Company, 5,000 spindles and 150 looms, Xinsheng Yarn Mill, 10,360 spindles, Zhaoxing Yarn Mill, 8,400 spindles, Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Mill, China Woolen Mill, 4,000 woolen spindles and 100 looms.

The machinery of the above mills did not come from inland cities such as Wuxi. (To be continued)

### Supply and Demand of Yarn and Cloth Amidst Rising Prices (Continued)

— Wang Fuli

Reading Table 7, the number of Chinese textile machines has been reduced to such a large extent. Although the output of yarn and cloth does not necessarily decrease in the same proportion due to differences in thickness and types, it is easy to infer that the supply is not meeting the demand. Even when combined with what British and Japanese merchants own or occupy, as shown in Table 8.

Reading Table 8, it can be seen that the quantity of yarn and cloth that the country can supply, even if the people do not buy all domestic products, is reduced by about 40% compared to before the war. This one point alone already leaves a lot of room for price increases, let alone other various reasons. The reason why it has maintained a considerable high price until now is well-founded. To meet the needs of the times, there are still a considerable number of new machines ordered before the war and old machines moved from the war zone that are being actively set up in the rear and can be opened soon. In addition, Mu's hand spinning machines with machine properties, sophisticated hand spinning weaving, Guangshi hand spinning machines, and Indian spinning waterwheel spinning are being planned one after another. It is firmly believed that a considerable production time will be achieved in the near future. The market price of yarn and cloth, which is necessary for daily use, will also fall accordingly. Let's wait and see. (End)

### Silk and Tea: Zhejiang Native Silkworm Cocoons Have Entered the Market; Cocoon Merchants Compete to Buy, Breaking the Price Limit; Shanghai and Wuxi Cocoon Collection is in Preparation

Jiangsu and Zhejiang Spring Cocoons: Have been launched one after another. Native cocoons in Zhejiang Province have exceeded the price limit. In the areas of Suzhou, Wuxi, etc., the local varieties have reached the stage of dormancy and leaf opening, and are about to be placed on the cocooning frames. The progress is quite good. Now, based on communications from various places, the main points are recorded as follows:

(1) Zhejiang Province

Zhejiang is located south of Jiangsu, and its climate is more temperate than Jiangsu. The sprouting of silkworms occurs earlier accordingly. Therefore, the spring cocoons are launched in the market about half a month earlier than in Jiangsu Province. This year, the native cocoons in various counties of Hangzhou Prefecture have all been launched in the market. The local varieties will be launched at the end of this month at the latest. The cocoon industry association has agreed to set a price limit of 45 yuan per dan for native fresh cocoons. The cocoon firms officially started collecting goods on the 18th. However, due to the unfavorable climate in Zhejiang Province this year, the humidity was uneven during the silkworm rearing period. As a result, the output has decreased. The cocoon firms have received very few goods in the past two days. The cocoon merchants, seeing that the silk market in Shanghai will not fall in the near future, fear that they will not receive enough goods. Therefore, each cocoon firm has released bids to solicit goods, and the market price has presented a chaotic situation. The total price of cocoons in the past two days has jumped from the limit price of 45 yuan to 52 yuan, an increase of 7 yuan. According to the opinion of people in the industry, the market price is still likely to continue to rise. It is expected that when the local cocoons are launched at the end of the month, the opening price will be as high as 80 yuan.

(2) Wuxi

The cocoons produced in this county are best known in the southwest region. In recent years, the north region has also been rising rapidly. The silkworms in the four townships have all entered the stage of dormancy and leaf opening. From the time of hatching to the time of dormancy, the spring breeze is blowing gently, and the climate is mild. Therefore, the development process is exceptionally good. The silkworms are healthy and there are no symptoms of disease. If there are no major disturbances from the time of dormancy to the time of cocooning, they can steadily move towards a healthy state. According to investigations, the cocoons are very good this year in Zhangjing Bridge, Yuqi, Luoshe in the north township, and Shitang, Nanqiao, Fangquan, Xushe in the south township, near Jiangyin, and Zhang Miaoshe, etc. Among them, several places have already started cocooning. Because of the early and late hatching, the launch in the market also has a sequence. In the areas of Suzhou and Wuxi, the scales can be opened in early June.

(3) Shanghai

The cocoon firms in the guerrilla zone leased by the silk manufacturers in Shanghai are busy preparing for the collection of cocoons and other necessary matters due to the imminent launch of new cocoons. The Shanghai financial community is also happy to provide assistance on the issue of silk cocoon deposits. As soon as the first batch of goods arrives in Shanghai, a loan can be obtained by pledging the warehouse receipt. The manufacturers then use the loan to purchase goods, and so on in an endless stream until the end of the cocoon season. This is not only of great benefit to the silk industry in Shanghai, but also indirectly benefits the prosperity of our country's export goods. Regarding the saying that all ports are prohibited from shipping goods, the factories in Shanghai are determined to do everything possible to deal with it, enduring the pressure. Recently, orderly plans have been made, and people have been sent out to mediate. Therefore, it is feared that the situation has eased slightly. (Xiang)

### Finance: The Gold Market Remains Weak

Yesterday, the spot gold market in Shanghai was sluggish. As it was a Sunday holiday, very few members attended. The price was not quoted. It was heard that Yongfeng Gold Shop sold ten taels to Baocheng Gongji Silver Shop on the phone. The price was still 2,124 yuan. According to inquiries from money exchange shops, the selling price was still 2,124 yuan, and the buying price was 2,122 yuan. Transactions were also rare. The market trend remained flat and weak.

The exchange rate for gold jewelry per tael in silver shops remained unchanged. Datonghang quoted 216 yuan, and Xintonghang quoted 214 yuan (the buying price was 207-208 yuan).

London, 20th: The price of British pure gold remained unchanged at £7 8s 6d per ounce.

### The Difference Between Near and Distant Months in Silver Futures Narrows

London, Silver Market Telegram, 20th: The difference between near and distant months in silver futures narrowed by 0.0625. India and speculators made slight purchases, while Damu sold. The market situation was flat. New York Telegram: The spot price of silver in the United States remained flat. Bombay Telegram: The spot and near-term prices of silver in India rebounded by 1 anna, while the distant-term price remained unchanged. A total of 25 transactions were made.

### Grain: Changjing Rice Was Once Offered

Yesterday, various origins arrived. From Hexia, there were Songjiang and Nangang No. 4 and 5 rice, 3,400 to 3,500 packages of car-wheel dumplings from Suzhou and Tongbang, and 500 to 600 packages from Changzhou and Wuxi. The market sentiment suddenly became active at the start of the morning market, and sellers began to quote prices one after another. Changgao Geng Hui was offered at 18 yuan. Later, due to the wait-and-see attitude of hoarders, the actual demand was limited. There were only sporadic transactions on this street, and the market trend became flat. Changgao Geng was actually sold at 17.9 yuan, an increase of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. The same was true for other thick-grained and thin-grained rice. Du Yangbu sharp rice had a tight sentiment, but the market price did not rise or fall much. There was a continuous arrival of customer sharp rice, and people's hearts were more relaxed, so the sales were not smooth and remained stagnant. The price of Bianyuan remained at the original level, without any changes.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Sugar Rebounded with Production Prices

### North-South Goods: Longkou Noodle Shops Call for Higher Prices

Longkou rice noodles have been in short supply recently, and Nanyang gangs have also been active in buying them. They have been sold for 64 yuan, and they have been bought by a certain two shops, which makes them even more firm. Yesterday, the market even called for 70 yuan, although no transaction was made, which shows a glimpse of the tight situation. The base of Qingdao noodle cargo is also short, and the shops are selling at 45-46 yuan, which seems to be continuing to tighten.

### Hardware: Tianjin Sales of Tinplate are Strong

Over 500 Boxes Were Handled Yesterday

The prices of various hardware products have softened one after another, but the market for tinplate is still brisk. This is because customers and manufacturers on this street are all purchasing, resulting in a shortage of circulating goods, and the standards have also been raised accordingly. Yesterday, the Tianjin Tobacco Gangs handled another 900 boxes, and the market price rose by 2-3 yuan compared to before. The current selling price on the market is 69 yuan for 170 pounds and 70 yuan for 180 pounds (both American goods).

### Coal: The Price of Haifeng Coal is Firm and Expensive in the Off-the-Books Market

Haifeng white coal has not been flowing in smoothly recently, and the digestion on this street has not been slackening, so the supply cannot meet the demand. Yesterday, the off-the-books market rose by two yuan. According to the internal price of the same industry, the price of Haifeng screened lump coal is 45 yuan per ton, and the price of raw coal is 43 yuan. The price is higher at the wharehouse and includes the cost of transportation. However, due to the needs of street customers, the sales are still strong.

### Medicinal Materials: Galangal Sees New High Price Again

Since the change in the situation in South China, the source of Galangal has been blocked, resulting in a situation where the supply cannot meet the demand. The selling price has also gradually increased. Until recently, the old stocks here have been sold out, and the sales of Dalang Galangal are the most. It is heard that a certain shop, in order to adapt to the current situation, has transported it from Hong Kong, and about a hundred packages have arrived before and after. However, the external expenses have increased, so the asking price has increased by another six yuan compared to before, and it has been opened as many as possible.

### Western Envoys Granted Audience with the Emperor

The Emperor has allowed Western envoys to pay respects, exempting them from performing the three kneelings and nine prostrations ritual. That the Great Qing Emperor is able to allow non-observance of the central rituals is truly the epitome of friendly neighborliness. During the Qianlong era, an English envoy named Macartney led an embassy to court, bringing tribute. Upon entering, China presented him with the ritual of paying respects. Macartney declined due to unfamiliarity. The Emperor issued an edict exempting him from performing the prostration ritual, only following the ritual of monarchs of other European countries when paying respects. Once agreed, Emperor Qianlong met Macartney in the Hall of Supreme Harmony. Macartney held a golden box, adorned with pearls, containing the English Emperor's congratulatory message, raised it with both hands, ascended the steps, and presented it to the throne. Thereafter, Macartney paid respects several times in the capital and Rehe, all without prostrating.
