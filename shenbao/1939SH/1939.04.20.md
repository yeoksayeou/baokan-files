### The War Zone Covers Nine Provinces, Most of the Land is Still Governed by China, The Japanese Army Occupies Less Than Eight Percent of the Land

(London) British Foreign Secretary Butler gave a written response in the House of Commons today to a question from Labour Party member Pike, stating that according to the latest figures from Chinese official sources, the Chinese government has full administrative power over 61.5% of the nine provinces where the Japanese army is operating. It has administrative power over 7.5% of the areas occupied by the Japanese army, and administrative power over 31.1% of the areas where Chinese and Japanese troops each occupy a portion. Moorehead, an official in the India and Burma Affairs Department, answered a question from a certain member of parliament, stating that it is expected that the improvements currently underway will allow the Yunnan-Burma Road to remain open during the rainy season, and that there is an adequate supply of automobiles in four towns on the border. The Burmese section of the highway has not been specially protected against air attacks. Furthermore, Butler answered a question from Labour Party member Barling, stating that there are now war reports from the Kaifeng area, but it is impossible to know exactly what is happening. In addition, there have been no major changes in the Chinese situation since the Easter parliamentary recess. (18th Reuters Dispatch)

(London) At the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied to an inquiry from opposition Labour MP Buck, saying, "According to figures recently released by the National Government of China, there are a total of nine provinces where Japanese troops are present, of which 61.5 percent of the area is still under Chinese administration, the area controlled by the Japanese army accounts for only 7.5 percent, and the remaining 31.1 percent is still under Chinese administration in part, and under Japanese control in part."

### British Ambassador Arrives in Chongqing Yesterday to Handle Routine Business, No Special Mission

(Chongqing) British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, accompanied by staff member Secretary David Beadle and four others, departed from Kunming by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane on the 19th and arrived in Chongqing at 4:35 p.m. Chiang Kai-shek's representative Dong Xian Guang, Executive Yuan representative Zhang Pingqun, Foreign Ministry representative Duan Maolan, and British Consul-General in Chongqing Dayer all went to the airport to welcome him. The ambassador disembarked first, and the welcoming party immediately stepped forward to greet him. The ambassador returned the greetings one by one. At the time, our Foreign Ministry representative also presented the British ambassador with a copy of today's English-language "Free West News" containing an important speech by Chiang Kai-shek for him to read. The ambassador then returned to the Diplomatic Guesthouse to rest with his staff. Earlier this month, when the ambassador was in Shanghai, he met with British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie. According to reports, the two ambassadors discussed the Far East issue. Later, after Ambassador Craigie returned to Japan from Shanghai, he issued a statement saying that his trip to China had no special mission and that Britain's policy towards the Far East remained unchanged. The return of Ambassador Clark Kerr to Chongqing is to handle routine diplomatic business and has no other special mission. However, the ambassador's arrival in Chongqing today coincides with Chiang Kai-shek's important speech to Chinese and foreign journalists denouncing the theory of surrender and expressing his determination to resist the war. Therefore, the ambassador's determination to resist the war in China should be even clearer after this trip to Chongqing. (19th Telegram)

Editorial

### Dispute over the Prohibition of Flag Display in the French Concession

Yesterday was the day for promoting industry and commerce during National Spiritual Mobilization Week, so people from all walks of life in the two special districts of Shanghai voluntarily hung national flags to show their enthusiasm. Unexpectedly, in the French Concession, a conflict occurred between the police and citizens due to the prohibition of flag display. Fearing that the situation would escalate, the French Concession authorities have returned the national flags and released the detained citizens. It is hoped that the unfortunate incident can be brought to a close. During the tense situation, the citizens of the French Concession were greatly angered, and some stores even closed their doors in protest. For the sake of promoting friendly relations between countries and dispelling misunderstandings, we must offer sincere advice to the French authorities and the citizens.

The French Concession authorities and the citizens have always maintained a very good and close relationship. Especially since the outbreak of this Sino-Japanese war, the French Concession has strictly adhered to its neutral stance in order to maintain order within its boundaries and prevent it from being disrupted by violence, which has greatly impressed all citizens. Not long ago, a minor dispute over the prohibition of flag display occurred in the French Concession. Now, the same incident has occurred again. We believe that everything is due to misunderstandings, but we feel that this misunderstanding is too serious.

The national flag represents the honor of a country. From the perspective of international etiquette, friendly countries should not interfere with the free display of national flags by their own people, no matter what. Although the Shanghai concessions are special areas, they are still Chinese territory. The Chinese people should be as free to display their national flags as the people of other countries within the concession. How can this be interfered with? Given the wisdom of the French Concession authorities, it is unlikely that they do not understand this simple principle. Perhaps they believe that they have been deeply oppressed by the so-called "special environment," and in order to maintain order within the concession, they have resorted to this inferior tactic in order to appease the special interests. We dare not fully believe this.

However, we must advise the French Concession authorities: Given the particularly close relationship between China and France in recent times, the French authorities certainly recognize that only the National Government of China is the sole legitimate government of China. Therefore, they should not prevent the Chinese people from displaying the only legal national flag that they respect, lest it leave a bad impression on the relations between the two countries. If they believe that they have to be mindful of the power of special interests, then they would be betraying the traditional French spirit of national chivalry and freedom. The French national character has always been known for suppressing the strong and helping the weak, and advocating chivalry. At the end of the 18th century, the United States resisted British violence. At that time, the British army was overwhelming, no different from China today. However, many French men of virtue and ambition, and many formal army and naval forces, selflessly helped the American Revolutionary War of Independence. Historians all admire this spirit of chivalry. The French government is now demonstrating this spirit, working to suppress the strong and help the weak in Europe, and helping countries such as Poland resist potential aggressors. Why don't the French Concession authorities adhere to their government's policies and treat the citizens within the concession accordingly?

Presumably, the French Concession authorities, due to the activities of terrorist groups in recent times, have also warned against Shanghai citizens displaying national flags, fearing that it would cause incidents and harm the safety of citizens, thus prohibiting flag display. However, the International Settlement also displayed national flags yesterday. Why didn't any activities that disturbed public order occur? Even if we take a step back and forgive the good intentions of the French Concession authorities, they should have issued a notice beforehand, explaining the reasons for not displaying flags, and appealing to sincerity, so that citizens would naturally not have any misunderstandings. Now that no announcement was made beforehand, the citizens within the concession displayed national flags during the day for promoting industry and commerce during National Spiritual Mobilization Week, expressing their enthusiasm for protecting their country. According to usual practice, this does not violate the concession's police regulations, and it is something that citizens should do. The police authorities suddenly forced the citizens to take down their national flags, and when carrying out their duties, they inevitably took rash and hasty actions. How could this not arouse the public anger of the citizens? Recalling that last year, the International Settlement authorities prohibited the Isolated Army Battalion from displaying the national flag, which ultimately led to bloodshed. Now, the Chinese people in the isolated island, embracing the spirit of the Isolated Army, are willing to shed blood to uphold their national flag many times over. If it is handled improperly, what incidents could be imagined? Fortunately, the citizens of the French Concession were able to restrain their grief and indignation yesterday, so only minor clashes occurred. This is worthy of our admiration, but restraint can only be effective for a short time, not for the long term. We hope that the wise authorities of the French Concession will learn from the past and give this matter serious consideration, seeking a solution that satisfies the citizens within the concession.

Finally, we would like to advise the citizens in the concessions: in this extraordinary period, we hope that everyone will maintain the spirit of patience like yesterday and fight against the harsh environment. For the sake of justice, we will certainly not be willing to yield, but we must not cause major misfortunes due to misunderstandings. In the case of this incident, in addition to immediately lodging a protest with the French Concession authorities, the Shanghai public law organizations should immediately telegraph the central government, following diplomatic channels to lodge a formal protest with the French government, and demand that the same incident not occur again in the future. As for emotional disputes and rumored strikes, etc., these should be avoided as much as possible while waiting for a satisfactory resolution.

### The Chinese Army is in an Active Position, Strenuously Countering the Japanese Offensive, Continuously Counterattacking on a Broad Front, Japanese Soldiers Gradually Exhausted, New Troops Deployed for Battle

(Chongqing) According to authoritative military observers, the Chinese strategy is currently to launch continuous counterattacks on a broad front, especially against the Japanese army's diverted or weak forces, launching surprise attacks to prevent the Japanese army from concentrating its forces on one or several points and carrying out its offensive to advance further, while at the same time making it unable to hold the strongholds it has already seized.

Furthermore, according to a Chinese spokesman, the Chinese army on the Hanshui front is currently attacking the Japanese army from the west and north, in order to prevent the Japanese army from sending reinforcements from the south. At the same time, the Chinese army in Suixian and other places east of the Hanshui River is currently advancing southeast towards the Pinghan Railway. Xinyang on this railway is already under a three-sided encirclement by the Chinese army.

It is also said that the Japanese are currently reinforcing Xinyang with 5,000 troops, mostly newly arrived from Japan, all around 21 years old, who have received no more than three months of military training. This shows that the Japanese army is gradually exhausting its sources of soldiers and has no soldiers to transfer, and can only conscript new soldiers who have not experienced military service. Currently, there are fierce battles every day southwest of Xinyang. In addition, several thousand new Japanese soldiers have arrived in the Yuezhou area, possibly in preparation for a Japanese offensive southward along the Yuehan Railway. At the same time, the Japanese army in the Gao'an area has also been transferred to the Wuning area.

According to intelligence reports, there is currently a German advisor and ten Japanese officers in the Dezhou area, studying the guerrilla activities of the Chinese army in that area and preparing to carry out their so-called "sweeping" campaign. According to news, Japan is currently planning to advance along the Longhai Railway. Thirty Japanese aircraft bombed Zhengzhou and Changzhi and Jincheng in Shanxi as a prelude to their attack. As for Suqian in northern Jiangsu, the Japanese are currently gathering a large army, with the aim of preventing the Chinese army from advancing to southern Shandong and endangering the Japanese army's rear. (19th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to announcements here from the Chinese side, the Japanese army has been in a state of panic since the Chinese army began its counter-offensive in central China, and has been continuously transporting troops and reinforcements to Hankou and Dongting Lake. The 20th Division, originally stationed in southern Shanxi, has also been transferred to central China. In addition, the Japanese army's offensive along the Hanshui River has been intercepted by the Chinese army, bringing it to a halt. (19th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)

An Eurasia Aircraft Passenger Discusses

The Attack

Kaiyuan: Eurasia Aviation Corporation's No. 19 mail plane was attacked and forced to land by Japanese aircraft near Hekou on the 13th. Only one passenger, Li Quanmei, was on board. I visited Mr. Li tonight and he talked about the situation at the time with great emotion. Mr. Li is a businessman, 35 years old. He suffered minor injuries when the mail plane landed and is now gradually recovering. It is said that there were seven people on board in total, six of whom were Eurasia Company employees, including four Germans. The fact that all seven survived this incident was due to the German captain's calm handling of the situation and his excellent piloting skills. On that day, the mail plane was flying from Hanoi to Yunnan when it encountered three Japanese aircraft pursuing it at 3:15 p.m. Before long, it encountered another three Japanese aircraft, totaling six. Seeing this situation, the pilot immediately flew the mail plane into the clouds to hide. Thus, one side chased and the other side hid, for nearly an hour. The mail plane sometimes flew very high, but it was once attacked from above and below by six Japanese aircraft. The pilot finally used his exquisite piloting skills to escape the encirclement and forced the plane to land in a mountain valley in the high mountains, avoiding disaster. When I encountered the danger, I lay flat on the plane. My mood was very chaotic at the time, but the sound of the Japanese aircraft shooting at the mail plane could be clearly heard. [There were] several shots [hitting] the hull. After landing, the Japanese aircraft [continued] to drop eight bombs, fortunately, the hull only suffered minor damage and can still fly after repairs. The landing point was within the boundary of Maoping Town, only two li from the French Annam border. The pilot broke his ankle. Mr. Li also suffered several abrasions because he jumped out of the plane immediately after landing. After landing, he immediately tried to notify the Maoping Town authorities, who were ten miles from the landing site, and the authorities were able to come to the rescue in person within an hour, and sent people to escort [them] out of the country. The crew walked for three days and arrived at Fulin Station (transliterated, south of Lao Kai) in French Annam on the 16th. [They] experienced many hardships along the way. On one occasion, they only had eggs to eat, and [they] had to wade through a small stream that was knee-deep. After arriving at Fulin, I took a train to Yunnan and arrived in Kaiyuan tonight. The other seven crew members are still in Vietnam for treatment. (17th Dispatch) (Delayed)

### Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly Battle Report ‚ÄîApril 13th to 19th‚Äî

(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that recently, on all fronts, our side has repeatedly achieved significant victories. The enemy is exhausted from running around and appears panicked and disoriented. Especially this week, the Northern and Southern battlefields have seen successive victories and significant gains. The amount of enemy killed and territory recovered has shaken both domestic and international audiences. This victorious trend is gradually unfolding, and the enemy's desperate attempts to resist have been completely crushed. Despite the enemy's continuous, reckless spreading of rumors and denial of defeat, facts speak louder than words, and discerning individuals can see the truth. The battle's progress is summarized below:

Guangdong Front

In Guangdong, our troops have been attacking the enemy fiercely with unstoppable momentum, making rapid progress. Since the morning of the 13th, troops from the East River divided into four routes to encircle Zengcheng. By noon, the strategic points of Zhuguling in the north of the city, Jiatouling in the west, and Pingfengling in the east were occupied by our forces. Additionally, troops were dispatched to cut off the enemy's communication line between the south of the city and Shitan, Guangzhou, defeating enemy reinforcements. By evening, the vanguard troops stormed into the city through the north and south gates. The enemy resisted fiercely, leading to intense street fighting. Around 2 AM the next morning, the remaining enemy was completely wiped out, and Zengcheng was officially recovered. Over 1,000 enemies were killed. In the past two days, leveraging the momentum of victory, they continued to advance towards Guangzhou. The sound of cannons can already be heard in Guangzhou. After recovering Huaxian in the North River, on the 16th, combined forces of various armies launched a brave attack, quickly recovering Southwest Town and pressing towards Guangzhou. As of yesterday afternoon, they were only twelve miles away from Guangzhou. In the West River, our troops approached Sanshui and Foshan on the 15th and 16th and are currently besieging them. The enemy's three major strongholds in Guangdong are Zengcheng in the East River, Huaxian in the North River, and Sanshui in the West River. The northeast two strongholds are now completely under our control. The traffic on the Guangzhou-Kowloon, Yuehan (Guangdong-Hankou), and Guangzhou-Sanshui railways is also completely under our control. The encirclement of Guangzhou is largely complete. In the areas of Xinhui and Jiangmen, Guifeng, Duruan, Jinggen, and other places have been successively captured. Jiangmen and Xinhui are ready to be attacked, posing a significant threat to the mouth of the West River. The enemy trapped in the isolated city of Guangzhou has had their retreat cut off and are now like turtles in a jar, extremely panicked and trying to flee.

Henan Front

The enemy in Henan Province has been under continuous general offensive by our forces this week, evolving into a major annihilation battle. In eastern Henan, our troops stormed into Kaifeng last Wednesday (11th) and Thursday (12th), wiping out over 2,000 enemies. The enemy's important base in the Central Plains has been occupied by our forces twice. This week, with renewed courage, they continued their fierce attack. On the evening of the 14th, our large force again approached the South Gate. The enemy dispatched over 2,000 reinforcements from the Longhai Railway, who disembarked at Zhangzhuang and were intercepted by our forces in the Nanditang area, leading to a fierce close-quarters battle. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, with piles of corpses. At the same time, another part of our army took advantage of the victory to capture Xuchang County, cutting off the Longhai Railway. The remaining enemy in Kaifeng has no way to retreat and is desperately holding on. Our troops besieging Xinyang in southern Henan have completely cleared out the remaining enemy on the southeast side of the city. This week, the enemy stubbornly resisted in the northwest suburbs of the city, launching fierce attacks westward from Zengshan, Shijiafan, and Zhujiafan, but were met with head-on blows, resulting in over 600 enemy deaths. The enemy fled in disarray. By noon on the 14th, after recovering Shijiafan and Zhujiafan, we took advantage of the situation to occupy Xianshan, three or four miles west of the city, forcing the remaining enemy to retreat into the city. Changhe Pass, the enemy's retreat route to the north, has also been surrounded by our forces. On the 14th and 15th, we stormed in from the north and south gates, capturing many enemies. The battles in both places are unfolding fiercely.

Hubei Front

The enemy troops in northern Hubei, in order to defend their strongholds of Yingshan and Anlu, launched several roundabout counterattacks towards our troops approaching the county towns on the 14th and 15th. After being intercepted separately in places like Haojiadian and Yujiadian, and after several days of fierce fighting, the enemy released poison gas unsuccessfully and completely collapsed on the morning of the 17th. After a determined pursuit, over a thousand enemies were killed. Both county towns are still under our siege. After Xiaojiadian, Xinji, and Yangzizhen, the strongholds around Zhongxiang in central Hubei, were recovered last week, the enemy troops in the city launched several counterattacks this week, but were all repelled, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. The remaining enemy, only about 600, can be completely wiped out soon. The enemy west of Yuekou, attempting to advance towards Heilu Ferry to reinforce Zhongxiang, was met with a sudden counterattack by our troops at dawn on the 17th. The enemy resisted stubbornly, leading to a bloody battle lasting two days and one night. By the evening of the 18th, the enemy was completely annihilated, with over a thousand infantry and over a hundred cavalry killed, and over a hundred horses and over ten light and heavy machine guns seized. We are now taking advantage of the victory to press towards Yuekou. At the same time, our troops who recovered Yuxin River attacked the outskirts of Tianmen on the afternoon of the 16th. The enemy is desperately defending the city, on the verge of collapse. Our large forces crossing the river have arrived in a steady stream. The enemy on the east bank of the Xiang River will have nowhere to be buried.

Shanxi Front

In southern Shanxi, our attacking troops have launched a large-scale mop-up operation against the remaining enemy near the suburbs of Xia County and Wenxi County for days, achieving great results. On the 15th, over a thousand enemies were dispatched from Anyun to reinforce Xia County, but were ambushed by our forces, resulting in over half of the enemy killed. The remaining enemy fled back the way they came. Another part of our army took advantage of the victory to occupy Yangshe, Podi, Guojiabao, and other key points southeast of Wenxi. The enemy abandoned over 700 bodies. The enemy stubbornly defending Zhangdian Town and Weiguo Town collapsed after fierce attacks on the 15th and 16th and fled north. Over two thousand enemies from Yicheng in eastern Shanxi attacked us on the morning of the 13th, but were cut into several sections using mobile tactics. The enemy fled in panic back into the city. We took advantage of the victory to follow closely. On the morning of the 14th, the enemy abandoned the city and fled towards Fushan, but were ambushed halfway, suffering heavy casualties. Yicheng and Fushan were thus recovered again. Another 3,000 enemies who invaded the east and west of Mochi via the Baijin Highway attempted to attack Yushe but were met with a brave counterattack. The enemy's momentum was greatly reduced, and the city was recovered on the 16th. In Lishi and Zhongyang in western Shanxi, our troops have been fighting fiercely this week, killing many enemies. The enemy's attempt to cross the river and attack westward has been suppressed and thwarted. The enemy in Jingle in northern Shanxi has been under siege for over ten days. This week, part of our army once stormed into the city. The enemy's strength has been greatly depleted. In addition, the enemy in northern Jiangxi has been under our general offensive this week. Wanshou Mountain, south of Nanchang, has fallen into our hands. We are now fiercely attacking the provincial capital. West of Wuning, our troops have wiped out the enemy troops in the suburbs, and the county town and suburbs are all within our sphere of influence. As for our troops counterattacking Gaoan, after once occupying the county town last week, they engaged in several battles for the suburban positions. The remaining enemy has been fleeing in disarray to Fengxin and Anyi. The enemy troops are extremely exhausted and unable to attack again.

Other Fronts

Our troops once recovered Bailing Temple in the Suiyuan area, killing nearly a thousand enemies. In the past few days, they have been attacking Guyang and Saxian with smooth progress. Yixing was recovered in Jiangnan, and Pixian and Haimen were recovered in northern Jiangsu. Hejian, Qingyun, Xinhua, and Nanhe were recovered in Hebei. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway was also further sabotaged with four large iron bridges blown up between Tai'an and Gushan (southwest of Jinan), completely controlling traffic on the entire line. All are becoming stronger and stronger, like autumn winds sweeping away fallen leaves, providing powerful proof of our belief that we will win the War of Resistance. (19th Dispatch)

### Su Bao's Commentary: The Domestic Situation in Japan - Open Conflict Within the Ruling Class

(Moscow) A newspaper here recently published an article examining the proceedings of the 74th session of the Japanese Diet. It pointed out that this session exposed the open conflicts within the Japanese ruling class, reflecting their panic over the growing resentment of workers and farmers. All the difficulties of the invasion of China are borne by the working class and farmers. In the past, the Japanese people had developed a psychology that Japan's war against China was an "unresisted victory," but now the Japanese militarists themselves are advocating preparations for a "hundred-year war."

Increasing Difficulties in the War Against China. This new preparation for adventure has alarmed some members of the Japanese Diet. For example, Civil Administration Party member Nakayama said to the military, "Regarding the so-called preparation for a 'hundred-year war,' it is better to keep it in your heart and not publicize it openly in newspapers and magazines."

Low Wages and High Prices. What fruits the Japanese people have obtained from militarism can be proved by the working hours and wage figures published in Japanese newspapers. For example, if the Japanese workers' wage index was 100 in 1936, it had dropped to 85.3 in January 1939. At the same time, retail prices of goods continue to rise. For example, if it was 100 in 1932, it had increased to 142.7 by the end of February 1939. Regarding working hours, someone in the Diet claimed that the 12-hour workday system was an unattainable ideal.

Oppressing the People and Restricting Consumption. Regarding all necessities, Japan has implemented a special tax of 10% on the value. The Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry is stipulating a system of allocation cards for all general consumer goods on a per capita basis. The Minister of Finance declared in the Diet that he would "use force to compel the people to restrict consumption."

Small and Medium Industries Collapse One After Another. According to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 26,660 small and medium-sized industrialists in Japan have gone bankrupt. In the next two or three months, another 50,000 will suffer the same fate. This is due to a shortage of raw materials and a reduction in the production of non-war-related goods.

The Burden on Hundreds of Millions of People Increases Daily. An interesting fact was exposed in the Diet. It was claimed that the Japanese government does not bear the burial expenses of soldiers killed in battle. Therefore, the people have to pay a strange "death tax," which further increases the burden on families who have lost their breadwinners.

All of this has led to a growing resentment among the Japanese people, which Diet member Imai called "the resentment of the people towards officials (i.e., the government)." As a result, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma had to admit in the Diet that the current domestic situation is helping to fuel the rise of communist ideas. (19th TASS dispatch)

Chairman Lin's Condolences

To the Xie Family

(Chongqing) Chairman Lin sent a telegram of condolence to the family of National Government Committee Member Xie Huisheng. The original telegram reads: "To Madam Xie Dekan and Brother Shixiong at the Xie Residence in the Housheng Agricultural Farm in Chengdu, I was shocked to learn of Mr. Huisheng's death from the telegrams of comrades Jinfan and Jilu. I am deeply saddened by the fact that Mr. Xie dedicated himself to the Party and the country for more than 30 years, enduring prolonged illness and national disasters. The loss of an elder statesman is heartbreaking. However, his accomplishments will endure and remain immortal. I hope you will grieve with propriety, help with important matters, and comfort his spirit. This is my sincere hope. Lin Sen, with seal." (18th dispatch)

The Air Force in Shanxi

Xingji In recent days, the brave Chinese Air Force has been unusually active in Shanxi Province. It bombed Houma and Taiyuan on the 8th, bombed Taigu on the 10th, attacked Taiyuan again on the 11th, and dropped many bombs in Yuci. At 2 PM on the 14th, a Chinese aircraft circled and scouted over Jiang County for twenty minutes before leisurely flying west. (19th dispatch)

### Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Reports: The United States Will Send a Note to Japan Proposing a Solution to the Sino-Japanese Problem; Japan's Established Policy is Not to Accept

(Hong Kong) Tokyo, 19th Dispatch, The Asahi Shimbun reports that it is rumored that US President Roosevelt will submit a note to Japan at the end of April, the content of which is roughly the same as the recent telegram to Germany and Italy, stating that if Japan wants to convene an international conference to solve the Far East problem, the United States is willing to support it. It is said that the United Kingdom and the United States have reached an understanding on naval affairs. The British navy is concentrated in the Mediterranean, and the majority of the US navy is moving to the Pacific. Therefore, the United States is very likely to propose a solution to the Sino-Japanese incident to Japan. However, if the US president does take this measure, Japan will definitely reject it. According to the Japanese government's repeated declarations, it is sufficient to show that Japan believes that the method of convening an international conference is neither effective nor appropriate to stabilize the East Asian situation in the process of establishing a "new order." This morning, foreign reporters inquired about the matters reported in the Asahi Shimbun to the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the reply was that the matters reported were nothing but the reporters' speculation. Regarding the US President's telegram to Germany and Italy, the Japanese spokesperson declined to comment. A reporter asked how Japan feels about the gradual concentration of the US fleet in the Pacific. The Japanese spokesperson said that Japan does not pay attention to this matter. The entry of the US Navy into the Pacific is only a matter of returning to its original defense. (19th dispatch)

### Britain Strengthens the Strength of the Far East Fleet by Replacing Old Ships with Larger New Ships - The Anti-Aggression Alliance Will Include China

(London) The British cruiser Cardiff of 4,290 tons, stationed in Chinese waters, has been in service for 22 years. The Admiralty has now announced that this ship will be recalled at the end of this month and replaced with a larger cruiser. This has aroused great interest in naval circles and those concerned about the Far East. Some predict that the newly tested and fully equipped 10,000-ton cruiser Edinburgh will be sent to China. Although this news has not been confirmed, Reuters is sure that the replacement for Cardiff will be a 10,000-ton cruiser. Another large cruiser, Cornwall, is currently en route to China. At the same time, two old ships of the East India Fleet have now been recalled and replaced with two new ships, Manchester and Liverpool. Another, Gloucester, is also en route to East India to replace the flagship Norfolk. Because the United Kingdom is restricted by the Washington Naval Treaty, it has been unable to restore the strength of its fleet stationed in China to its pre-European War levels. However, new warships are now being completed one after another, so old ships will be gradually replaced to enhance Britain's naval position in the Far East. According to experts, in the event of an incident, the five new cruisers currently sailing to the Far East can be combined to form a fleet of equal strength. (19th Reuters dispatch)

(Washington) According to today's diplomatic observers, the fact that Roosevelt suddenly summoned the US fleet back to the Pacific is sufficient to clarify the current international situation and the proximity of a world war. It is said that this decision was made by President Roosevelt personally, and the generals of the ships were unaware of it beforehand. Informally, it is generally believed that this move is a strategy to deal with Japan, or an indication of a tacit understanding between the United Kingdom and the United States. (19th Associated Press dispatch)

(London) Today, Labour Party member Henderson asked in the House of Commons whether the government had decided that China and other Far Eastern countries needed to join the anti-aggression alliance. Chamberlain replied that the United Kingdom was very willing to consider this issue. (19th Associated Press dispatch)

(London) It is rumored that when British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Dr. Guo Taiqi spoke at the Foreign Office on Tuesday, the extension of the anti-aggression front to the Far East was mentioned for the first time. Today, Labour Party member Hantson will say to Chamberlain in the House of Commons, 'Has the government ever decided to make China or other Far Eastern countries participate in the anti-aggression front?' Hantson told an Associated Press reporter that since one end of the anti-communist axis is in East Asia, the new collective security system must include both the East and Europe to be effective. I do not intend to exclude Japan from this front, nor do I intend to encircle Japan. If Japan can adopt a non-aggressive policy, I welcome Japan's participation. Diplomats interviewed by the Associated Press believe that if the current negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are the second stage in establishing an anti-aggression front, then the participation of China and other Asian countries in the anti-aggression front is the third stage. However, the return of the US fleet to the Pacific is regarded here as a signal to contain aggression in the eastern hemisphere. Even Chinese people here only hope that Britain will provide China with further financial assistance and reduce or stop British trade with Japan. (18th Associated Press dispatch)

Sixty Percent of the World's Gold

Is Concentrated in the United States

Roosevelt Convenes a Meeting of Financial Experts

(Washington) President Roosevelt met with financial experts in the government yesterday, such as Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, to discuss how to protect the US Treasury and its economic institutions under the threat of a European war. The reason for convening this meeting is that in the past four weeks, gold flowing into the United States from Europe is estimated to be around $500,000,000, suddenly bringing the gold stored in the US Treasury to $15,500,000,000, or 60 percent of the world's gold. The government not only expressed that the concentration of gold in the United States should be dealt with, but the president also attempted to protect the US securities and foreign exchange markets during this period of tense European situation. Those who consulted with the President today included Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Agriculture Secretary Wallace, Federal Reserve Chairman Eccles, Securities and Exchange Commissioners Hanles and Frank.

Roosevelt's Great Move

Britain is Very Moved

The Cabinet Discusses National Defense

(London) Reuters' House of Commons correspondent said that when Prime Minister Chamberlain mentioned President Roosevelt in the House of Commons today, the whole house cheered, showing that the members of the House were satisfied with the US President's telegram calling for peace. Members occasionally asked the Prime Minister about Anglo-American cooperation to seek European peace, but the wording was cautious, and they were quite concerned about US policy. Today, the members discussed the US President's actions in more detail and were more excited than before. The general opinion is that the US President showed his courage at the right time. It can be seen that the US President's actions have had a calming effect on the British Parliament. All parties praised the US President's actions, but no one had extravagant hopes for the results of the US President's move. (18th Reuters)

(London) Reuters' Parliamentary correspondent has learned that the issue of implementing conscription in the United Kingdom is one of the important aspects of national defense. The Cabinet may consider this at its weekly meeting today. In addition, there are other matters to be considered: (1) The establishment of the Ministry of Military Supplies and the selection of ministers, (2) The reduction of reserved tasks in national service, in order to encourage the recruitment of national defense volunteers, (3) The compulsory implementation of non-military physical education for young people nationwide. According to Reuters' correspondent, conscription is still regarded as unlikely to be implemented in the United Kingdom, but the opinions on the necessity of this system at home and abroad are currently being carefully studied. Secretary of War Perry-Xia had a long meeting with Prime Minister Chamberlain yesterday. It is reported that Perry-Xia strongly supports the establishment of a Ministry of Military Supplies, or a similar agency, to assist national defense and supply the equipment necessary for the expanded British army. Now the number of national defense volunteers has doubled, so this issue is becoming increasingly acute. (19th Reuters dispatch)

(London) It is reported that the Cabinet decided to establish a Ministry of Military Supplies at its meeting this morning. The candidates for the Minister of the Ministry include Morrison, the Minister for Lancaster County Affairs, and Lord Weir, the former advisor to the Aviation Department, but they have not yet been finalized. (19th Havas dispatch)

(Washington) Colonel Lindbergh will enlist tomorrow to serve as a special agent in the office of the Air Force Corps Commander. (18th Reuters dispatch)

(Washington) Secretary of War Woodring recently announced that the famous aviator Colonel Lindbergh is scheduled to begin investigating the US's ability to manufacture aircraft tomorrow. Once a conclusion is reached, it will be reported to the government. (18th Havas dispatch)

### American Cruiser Visits Malta, Part of German Fleet Departs for Naval Exercises off the Coast of Spain

Malta: It was announced here today that the American cruiser "Omaha" is scheduled to visit Malta from April 25th to May 2nd. Naval officials declined to comment on the significance of the American ship's visit to the British naval base. Observers pointed out that the American ship's visit to Malta coincides with the German Reichstag meeting (April 28th), which is particularly noteworthy. It is reported that Hitler will deliver a speech in the Reichstag on April 28th in response to Roosevelt's peace appeal (April 19th, Associated Press).

(Berlin) Twenty-five German warships and several auxiliary vessels, which will conduct exercises off the coast of Spain, have begun concentrating off Schillig Roads today. Battleships and submarines left the Kiel naval port at night, while the rest departed from Wilhelmshaven this morning. According to official announcements, the German ships will be at sea for a month. The exercise area is in the Atlantic Ocean west of Spain. According to unofficial sources today, the German fleet's final destination will be an Italian port. It is rumored that they will visit Lisbon around April 28th. The German official schedule for the fleet voyage, from April 27th to May 19th, includes seven Spanish ports, as well as Ceuta, Tangier in Africa, and Lisbon. (April 18th, Reuters)

(Berlin) Forty German warships, including twenty-eight combat vessels, sailed yesterday for the waters off Spain, Portugal, and Spanish Morocco. The German government issued a public statement at the time of the navy's departure, declaring that this action had no military significance. However, in reality, it is of great military importance, as the German navy can join with the Italian Mediterranean fleet. Although the British and French fleets in the Mediterranean are superior in large ships, they are inferior to the combined German-Italian fleet in smaller vessels. The respective strengths in the Mediterranean can be compared as follows: British ships are currently concentrated in Malta, while French ships are concentrated in Gibraltar. Simultaneously, a combined British-French fleet of one hundred and fifty ships is patrolling the Strait of Tangier at the entrance to the Mediterranean to prevent any unforeseen events. (April 19th, Associated Press)

Tangier: Today, large numbers of new Moroccan troops arrived in Ceuta and Melilla in Spanish Morocco from Cadiz, Adarg√≥n, and Algeciras in Spain, further increasing the panic here. According to observers' calculations, there are currently 60,000 Moroccan troops concentrated in Spanish Morocco, compared to the usual peacetime force of approximately 30,000 troops. Furthermore, as Muslims are scheduled to celebrate "Eid al-Adha" on May 1st and 3rd, there are deep fears here that dissidents will take the opportunity to cause trouble, providing a pretext for totalitarian states to take interventionist actions. It is also reported that Moroccan troops have been spotted near Bougta√Ø, on the border of the Tangier International Zone. The area is undefended and is a key point on the road between Tangier and Tetouan. (April 18th, Associated Press)

(London) The Spanish High Commissioner to the International Neutral Zone of Tangier has provided firm assurances to the British Consul that Spain has no intention of threatening the port and that there are no troop or warship movements. Rumors that Spain intends to attack the port are entirely unfounded. Furthermore, the Portuguese government is said to have notified the British government that there are no Italian troop movements on the Portuguese-Spanish border and that rumors of Portugal being under threat of attack are baseless. Well-informed sources here recently stated that the British Admiralty is no longer as pessimistic about the situation in the western Mediterranean as it once was, and that the German fleet's voyage to patrol off the coast of Spain does not pose a serious threat. (April 18th, Havas)

South Africa

Eight Thousand Germans Residing,

Mostly Armed

Windhoek, South Africa: Territorial Council member, Mr. Theron told a Reuters reporter today, regarding sending reinforcements to South-West Africa yesterday, that there are eight thousand Germans in South-West Africa, most of whom are armed and organized. Given the current situation, they may act irresponsibly. Although any such uprising or attempt to sabotage will inevitably fail, lives will be lost and significant damage will be caused. In any case, prevention is better than cure. The police reinforcements dispatched from Johannesburg and Bloemfontein yesterday will arrive here tomorrow. At the same time, police from various stations in South-West Africa are currently concentrating here. The authorities have hastily prepared accommodation. Windhoek is the capital of South-West Africa. (April 18th, Reuters)

Cape Town: At a financial meeting today, South African statesman General Smuts, while proposing a motion to incorporate the South-West African police into the South African police, declared: "Austria's annexation was justified by its failure to maintain law and order. The same cannot be said of the South African Union government. The government will continue to fulfill its responsibility for administering the mandated territory until that responsibility is relinquished. Given the seriousness of the information received by the government in the past week, public opinion may deem the number of troops dispatched to the mandated territory to be insufficient. However, it is hoped that the steps taken will achieve the desired effect, and that no movement will arise in the territory that undermines good order." Smuts also pointed out that the police force in South-West Africa is extremely limited, with only 240 police officers scattered throughout the territory, and that it is necessary to concentrate the police in areas where disturbances are likely to occur. Smuts concluded by saying that the police movements have no military significance. (April 19th, Reuters)

Ambassador Guo's Speech

China's Resistance War

(London) Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi, in a speech at a banquet hosted by the North American Club, stated that he was pleased that U.S. President Roosevelt's remarks regarding events in Asia were as resolute and practical as when addressing European issues. Regarding the Sino-Japanese War, China is fighting for international justice and for the democratic system of all nations. China has been sustaining the war almost entirely on its own strength for twenty-one months now. It is not only fighting for its own country, but also forcing the partners in the aggressor camp in Asia to become mired in our country's quagmire, which is beneficial to all democratic countries in the world. (April 19th, Havas)

### Japanese Newspapers Speculate,

### That Roosevelt Favors Japan,

### Requesting to Send the Same Telegrams to German and Italian Leaders,

### The Japanese Foreign Ministry Considers it Speculation

(Tokyo) Asahi Shimbun reports that U.S. President Roosevelt intends to send a telegram in his own name to the Japanese government, similar to the letters sent to Hitler and Mussolini. President Roosevelt may announce that the United States is willing to actively mediate and convene a conference of nations with interests in the Far East to find a solution to the current situation in East Asia, but only after Japan agrees. The newspaper further predicted that President Roosevelt will send this telegram after the American ship Astoria, carrying the ashes of former Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito, departs from Yokohama. The newspaper also stated that Japanese authorities have already discussed Japan's response. Japan will: (1) agree with the German and Italian replies to the U.S., which are expected to reject President Roosevelt's appeal; (2) maintain the position that a Far East conference is not an effective or appropriate way to handle the situation, and Japan will refuse to agree to convene such a conference. (April 19th, Reuters)

(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry declared today that the report in the Asahi Shimbun that President Roosevelt seems to be sending a telegram to Japan in his own name is purely speculation. (April 19th, Reuters)

(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, in response to a question from a foreign reporter today, said, "Japan does not believe that the U.S. fleet's transfer to the Pacific is of much significance, as it is merely the fleet returning to its original base." When another reporter asked if the Japanese government had received information regarding the exchange of goods between China and Germany, the spokesman replied that he had not heard anything about it. (April 19th, Reuters)

### More Than Fourteen Hundred Suicides in Tokyo

(Tokyo) According to statistics from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, there were 1,498 suicides and 386 attempted suicides in Tokyo in 1938, totaling 1,884 people, including 1,143 men and 741 women. (April 19th)

### U.S. Munitions Statistics,

### Overall Greatly Reduced,

### But Kerosene Still Increasing

According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce, the United States exports of munitions to Japan, there are fourteen categories, and the quantity and value are more than in the past, the last six months, from August 1938 to January 1939, the total value is US$98,744,526, and from August 1937 to January 1938, the total was only US$81,037,757, here is a comparison table:

The above fourteen categories total US$98,744,526 US$81,07,757 According to the total US exports to Japan, from August 1938 to January 1939, the last six months, not more than US$116,000,000, and military supplies accounted for more than 85% of the total.

In addition, according to news from various places on the west coast, the amount of American kerosene shipped to Japan is still increasing rapidly, for example, from March 13th to 26th in the port of Los Angeles, a total of 3,440,000 barrels of kerosene were shipped to Japan in two weeks, and in the week ending April 1st, another 1,833,000 barrels were shipped. In total, 5,541,864 barrels of kerosene were shipped to Japan in March, and the number in April may be more than this. (April Havas Air Communication)

### French Liner Paris,

### Caught Fire and Sank at Night,

### Suspected of Sabotage,

### Prior Warning Received

Le Havre: The 34,000-ton giant ship Paris, which caught fire last night, sank today despite the best efforts of the fire brigade. It is currently impossible to determine whether the fire was accidental or due to sabotage. Local authorities have begun an investigation. According to a director of the shipping company, Margraiff, speaking in London, the burning of the ship is highly suspicious of sabotage, and as a precaution against possible accidents, the ship was specially guarded at the Le Havre dock. The Paris was one of France's finest luxury liners, capable of carrying over 3,000 passengers. (April 19th, Reuters)

Le Havre: The French Atlantic Shipping Company's "Paris" liner, with a displacement of 34,000 tons, is the company's third largest liner. It was docked in this port and caught fire suddenly last night. Despite strenuous efforts to extinguish the fire, the fire was too fierce and it sank before noon today. The fire chief fell into the cargo hold and died on the spot. Several firefighters were also burned. (April 19th, Havas)

Le Havre: The French Shipping Company's "Paris" liner, docked in this port, suddenly caught fire from the kitchen at 10:30 last night. The fire was extremely fierce. After the fire brigade worked hard to put it out, it was extinguished this morning. The ship was badly damaged. The previous report of sinking is inaccurate. All passengers and crew are safe and sound. However, the fire chief and a firefighter unfortunately died in the line of duty. The ship was carrying ten aircraft shipped from the United States, as well as gold and jewelry worth 75 million francs, which were not affected. In addition, there were many antiques and famous oil paintings from the Louvre Museum that were intended for display at the New York World's Fair, all of which were priceless treasures. They were originally scheduled to be shipped to the United States on this ship, but fortunately, they were all stored on the dock, avoiding the disaster. However, in the hasty confusion, a wooden box containing two antique bottles and many ancient books suddenly went missing and could not be found. The shipping minister, Shaplan, and the police authorities have departed from Paris to investigate the truth about the fire. Local officials here declared that it is difficult to say at this time whether this was an accident or a conspiracy. According to the Paris evening newspaper, this was negligence caused by arson. Rumor has it that the police authorities had notified the French Shipping Company a few days ago, saying that according to confidential reports, someone was attempting to harm the company's Normandy and Paris liners. The company then took various precautions. Last night, a sailor was arrested by the night patrol while sneaking into the cabin from a window in the dark. Five chefs were also questioned by the police, and the police closed the kitchen at 6:00 p.m. It is said that someone used a counterfeit key to open the door and placed an incendiary bomb, resulting in this disaster. However, it is also said that it was caused by a short circuit in the electrical wiring. Which is true must be determined after the investigation is completed. The Paris has been operating on the Atlantic route between New York and Le Havre since 1921. It is 233 meters long, 26 meters wide, has 46,000 horsepower, a speed of 22 knots per hour, and can accommodate 3,233 passengers and 700 crew members. (April 19th, Havas)

### Hitler Returns to Berlin,

### Presides Over Diplomatic Activities,

### Receives Romanian Foreign Minister,

### Appoints Papen as Ambassador to Turkey

(Berlin) Since Hitler returned to Berlin from Austria, Germany once again took the diplomatic initiative in Europe yesterday. In order to achieve diplomatic efforts and curb the containment policy of Britain and France, Germany intends to contact Romania, Hungary, and Turkey, so that they also attach themselves to the Rome-Berlin Axis, in order to expand its sphere of influence. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu arrived here last night from Bucharest and immediately conferred with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. It is said that the German Foreign Minister still insists that Romania must explicitly state whether it intends to join the British-French anti-aggression camp. At the same time, Hitler appointed former envoy to Vienna, Papen, as the German ambassador to Turkey. It is reported that this action was taken on Ribbentrop's advice and is another way to curb the containment policy of Britain and France. Papen is one of the most capable people at diplomatic boundaries. It is expected that his goal is to overturn the current military alliance negotiations between Britain and Turkey. Before arriving in Berlin, Gafencu had a brief discussion with Polish Foreign Minister Beck in Warsaw. It is rumored that the two countries have agreed that Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia should not enter into any defense agreement with the Soviet Union. According to the Polish side, this decision is entirely based on the "arrival of the Red Army in our country is as dangerous as an attack by German troops." It is also reported that Poland and Romania will refuse to recognize the British-Soviet military alliance. If the seriousness of this report is confirmed, then Soviet troops will not be able to directly open from the east and attack Germany. However, these developments should not have any impact on the air force agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Air Minister Goering is expected to arrive here from Rome today to confer with Hitler. It is said that Goering also carries with him Mussolini's decision on the reply to President Roosevelt's peace proposal. (April 18th, Associated Press)

(Berlin) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu paid tribute to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at 11 o'clock this morning and laid a wreath. At noon, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, he went to the Chancellery to meet with F√ºhrer Hitler and then had lunch with the Foreign Minister and held talks. (April 19th, Havas)

(Berlin) Foreign Minister Ribbentrop held a banquet this evening to welcome Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu and gave a welcoming speech, saying, "Your Excellency's visit will not only promote friendship between our two countries, but also greatly contribute to our joint efforts to improve the situation." Foreign Minister Gafencu immediately stood up and responded, praising the recently concluded supplementary commercial agreement between Germany and Romania, and said that this agreement will definitely have a positive impact on the relations between the two countries. (April 18th, Havas)

(Paris) Diplomatic circles here have learned that the German government has appointed former Prime Minister Papen as ambassador to Turkey, and are paying great attention to it. Papen served as the chief of staff of the Turkish Fourth Army during the European War. This decision to send an envoy to Turkey is Germany's last effort to win over Turkey and attempt to prevent Turkey from getting too close to Britain and France. However, officials here believe that Britain and France's invitation to Turkey to join the collective security organization is being negotiated and there is complete confidence of success. According to foreign sources, the Turkish and Greek General Staffs have already signed a cooperation agreement, stipulating that in the event of war in the future, the fleets of both sides will be commanded by the Greek Navy Commander, and the Greek army will be commanded by the Turkish Army Commander. (April 19th, Havas)

### Will Danzig's Status Change Soon? Perhaps as a Birthday Gift for Hitler?

(London) Foreign Secretary Butler declared in the House of Commons today that the League of Nations Council should consider any revision of Danzig's status. He also said that Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent remarks in the House of Commons have left no doubt about the British government's guarantee to Poland. (April 18th, Reuters)

(London) During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Liberal MP Mander asked, "Regarding the organization of a collective security system, do the agreements we are drafting with other countries stipulate mutual restraint, and will we allow all countries, including Germany, to sign and join?" Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "Regarding this matter, the government is exchanging views with other related governments. I have already explained this in my reply to Lord Adley yesterday, and there is nothing else I can tell you at this time." (April 19th, Havas)

### Arab Muslims,

### Anti-Italian Sentiment High,

### Urging Reconciliation with Jews,

### Saying Mussolini Broke His Word

(London) Many reports from Muslim countries in the Mediterranean region prove that Italy's annexation of Albania has aroused strong anger among Muslims. Syria, Iraq, and Palestine have expressed much resentment. Former Syrian Prime Minister Madamm recently stated that Italy's seizure of Albania will inevitably have a serious reaction in Arab Muslim public opinion. News from all sides has proven this to be true. Iraqi newspapers have unanimously expressed public outrage at the demise of Albania and have ridiculed Mussolini, who previously styled himself as a protector of Arab Muslims, contradicting himself. A Palestinian newspaper yesterday published a signed letter from an Arab celebrity, appealing to the Arabs and Jews of Palestine to dispel old grievances and jointly deal with the threat of dictatorial powers, saying that those who hoped that Mussolini would free them from their shackles can now see the truth. He believes that the Arabs who regarded the Rome-Berlin Axis as a way for them to be saved should no longer blindly follow it. This letter has attracted much attention. (April 18th, Reuters)

(Berlin) Although officials do not recognize the rumor that Germany is negotiating with Poland to peacefully return Danzig to Germany as a birthday gift for Hitler, there are many who believe it. (April 18th, Reuters)

### Hungarian Authorities,

### Talk with Italy

(Rome) Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Cs√°ky came here to hold talks with the Italian authorities, but no results have been achieved. It is learned that Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to go to the port of Venice on the 22nd of this month to hold talks with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Markoviƒá in order to reconcile Hungary and Yugoslavia. According to well-informed sources, the talks between Italy and Hungary are very harmonious. (April 19th, Havas)

### England and Russia Sign Military Alliance; Poland Still Has Objections; Russian Ambassador to England Returns Home for Instructions; Romanian Foreign Minister to Visit England

Warsaw - Foreign Minister Beck met with British Ambassador Sir Kennard today. Polish officials have taken a highly reserved attitude towards the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, specifically the invitation for the Soviet Union to join the collective security organization. They stated that these negotiations are unrelated to the mutual assistance agreement negotiated between Britain and Poland. The Polish government has not yet decided what stance it will take when Britain and the Soviet Union reach an agreement in the future. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Stockholm - Today, the Soviet Ambassador to England, Maisky, arrived here on his way back to his country. He denied carrying any concrete proposals from Britain, stating that his trip was purely to report on the European situation after being summoned back home. He added that it is not yet known how long he will stay in Moscow, which will depend on the development of the European situation, but it is unrelated to Hitler's speech in Parliament. (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)

(London) - Diplomatic circles here recently stated that Britain is negotiating with the Soviet Union with two goals in mind: 1. To encourage the Soviet Union to guarantee its neighboring countries, namely Poland, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania (note: Lithuania does not border the Soviet Union); 2. Mutual guarantees between Britain and the Soviet Union. The details of this matter are extremely complex, and it is uncertain whether an agreement can be reached before German leader Hitler's speech on the 28th of this month. However, based on the progress of the negotiations, there is sufficient reason to believe that a satisfactory outcome will be achieved. Regarding the first point, the return of Soviet Ambassador Maisky should contribute to its progress. It is reported that the Soviet Union has, in principle, accepted the idea of guaranteeing the security of Romania, but the specific details have not yet been resolved. The British government intends for the Soviet Union to declare, in general terms, that it will provide assistance under certain conditions when requested by Poland, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The "certain conditions" are not explicitly stated, to avoid Germany using this as an excuse to accuse the countries of pursuing an encirclement policy. Therefore, the wording is deliberately vague. In essence, the guarantee that the Soviet Union should provide is neither mutual automatic assistance nor unilateral automatic assistance. It is only when the aforementioned countries are invaded and request assistance from the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union will deploy its modern army to respond. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

(London) - Well-informed sources here recently stated that regarding Turkey's participation in the collective security organization, representatives of Britain and Turkey have signed an agreement in the Turkish capital. However, out of respect for the Turkish government's opinion, it will not be made public for the time being. The significance of this agreement leans heavily towards military aspects, and it contains various technical clauses, such as stipulating that British warships have free passage through the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits of Turkey. Premature disclosure before the completion of negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union would be inconvenient. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

(Paris) - Diplomatic circles here recently stated that the goal of negotiations between Britain, France, and Turkey is to establish a collective security system in the eastern Mediterranean, with Turkey playing a key role. There are three main measures: 1. Turkey should provide its naval bases for use by the British fleet and guarantee that British and French warships have free passage through the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits. In other words, to guarantee the transportation lines between Britain and France and the Soviet Union and Romania. 2. Turkey, as a military power in the Islamic world, must assist Britain and France in defending the Arab countries. 3. Turkey should promote a closer alliance among the Balkan Entente countries (Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey). Regarding the first point, since Britain provided a guarantee to Greece, Italy's invasion of Albania has caused unrest in southeastern Europe, which is now gradually stabilizing. In light of this, Turkey has decided to willingly assist the British fleet in exchange for Britain's guarantee. Regarding the second point, Turkey can assist Britain in strengthening its position in Palestine. Regarding the third point, the Turkish army is known for its elite status, and in the event of war, it would undoubtedly constitute an important factor in the Balkans, valued by the other countries of the Balkan Entente. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

(London) - Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu is scheduled to arrive in London before April 22 for a three- to four-day official visit. The details of the discussions between British officials and Gafencu have not yet been finalized. Gafencu arrived in Berlin today and will discuss matters with German officials for two days before traveling to London via Brussels. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Progress of the Czechoslovak Restoration Movement; Benes Appointed Leader

Chicago - Former Czech President Benes announced yesterday that he has agreed to serve as the leader of the two million Czechs living outside Czechoslovakia. He is currently working to establish a new Czechoslovak Republic. Comrades in London, Paris, and Moscow will likely issue a declaration urging all Czechs to begin a "new political action." He strongly agrees with this point. The so-called "action" refers to the Czechs joining the European anti-aggression front. Benes also stated that he is currently attempting to organize a "Czech National Council." (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)

### Slight Improvement in the European Situation

(London) - Diplomatic circles here recently stated that the international situation seems to have slightly improved. The following points can be made: 1. If Germany and Italy take further action, it will inevitably lead to a major war. Leaders Hitler and Mussolini are well aware of this. 2. The diplomatic efforts made by Britain and France to form a peace front have been supported by the United States. 3. After the democratic countries strengthened their defenses, the totalitarian countries no longer have the hope of a quick victory. Germany and Italy both lack food and raw materials and cannot sustain a long-term war. 4. During the tense situation over the Czech issue last September, all ships of German shipping companies were recalled. This is not the case at present, and scheduled slots are still being honored. 5. The claim that Germany will immediately annex the Free City of Danzig has been denied by Berlin. 6. Although the Spanish Civil War has ended, the wounds have not healed, and food is also scarce. It is unlikely to participate in the war. If it only provides its ports for use by the German and Italian navies, the British and French navies would immediately blockade them and take military action against the country. As for the German naval fleet patrolling in Spanish waters, in the event of war, it would certainly threaten the Atlantic transportation lines of Britain and France. However, Britain and France have already taken various preventive measures to offset this. Some in British political circles even said that Germany's dispatch of a distant fleet is only intended to demonstrate its power to the democratic countries and Spain. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

### If War Breaks Out in Europe, Japan May Not Immediately Attack Hong Kong; Japanese Reporter Warns Japan That the United States Will Immediately Join the War if Japan Attacks Hong Kong

A Hong Kong dispatch from the China Mail on the 14th states: Residents here, both Chinese and foreign, are now worried that if war breaks out in Europe, the security of Hong Kong may be affected. However, foreigners outwardly remain calm. The authorities have already begun air raid preparations. Chinese newspapers frequently publish plans to move residents of Victoria to the New Territories across the harbor. Wealthy Chinese refugees, having experienced aerial attacks in Guangzhou and other places, are particularly concerned that Hong Kong will be subjected to this misfortune again. According to observers here, even if Britain goes to war with Germany or Italy, it is not certain that Japan will join the Axis powers, nor is it certain that Japan will attack Hong Kong, because Japan is currently engaged in a war in China. One observer quoted a statement from a seasoned Japanese reporter for the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun. This reporter issued a warning from Washington last September, stating that if Japan attacks Hong Kong, the United States will almost certainly immediately join the war. This reporter is currently in Japan and recently published an article in the Nichi Nichi Shimbun, stating that the United States will not fight China and Japan, but if Japan attempts to occupy Hong Kong in a world war, it will definitely go to war with Japan. Therefore, the situation in Hong Kong may not be as dangerous as many pessimists believe.

A Jinhua dispatch reports that the Japanese army has been sending planes to bomb the counties along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, including Shangrao, Yushan, Quzhou, and Jiangshan, causing widespread devastation to the people. On the morning of April 8, Japanese planes attacked Jinhua in two waves, bombing the bustling commercial areas, cultural institutions, and civilian residences, including more than 20 locations such as the front of the courthouse, Sipailou Street, and the Sanqing Primary School and the attached elementary school of Jinhua Middle School. The extent of the devastation, the number of casualties, and the amount of damage were unprecedented. Details are as follows:

The first bombing occurred at 9:15 a.m. on April 8, when three Japanese planes arrived from Hangzhou. Ten minutes later, the Japanese planes had flown over the urban area of Jinhua and, without circling, directly bombed the bustling areas of the city, dropping more than 30 bombs and strafing with machine guns. The sounds of explosions and black smoke filled the air, and many civilians were killed or injured. A fire broke out in Sipailou after being hit by incendiary bombs. The Japanese planes dropped two more bombs on the outskirts of the city and then fled towards Pujiang. Within about 20 minutes, a Japanese plane once again infiltrated the city's airspace. Fires broke out successively where the bombs landed, and the fires were very intense. Unfortunately, there was a lack of water, making rescue difficult. Fortunately, the fire brigade from Fangyan rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm and worked hard to put out the fires. The fires were gradually extinguished after 3 p.m. The shops burned down in the Sipailou area included, on the right side, starting from Zhang Xinjie barbershop next to the World Bookstore, Lu Xiangtai grocery store, Mao Hengtai tin shop, Chuan Zhaocheng pen shop, Longhao New Hotel, Shiguang Clock Shop, Yuan Taiyu Tea Shop, Hua Xing Leather Shoe Store, Ronghua Dyeing Shop, Yongshunxiang Western Clothing Store, Modern Stationery Store, and Huacheng Medal Company. On the left side, starting from Bao Yitai foreign goods shop next to Baohe Western Clothing Store, Bu Ao Zhai pen shop, Fu Da Heng tea shop, Langtao Stationery Store, Huisheng Tang pharmacy, Wuweihe tea shop, Da Jixiang rice cake shop, Taichang leather shoe store, Shanghai Magazine Company and dozens of other shops were completely burned down. The Dagong Consumer Cooperative, Meizuishi shoe store, and Mengsheng pen shop also had most of their buildings destroyed, resulting in significant losses. Lu Lao San, the owner of Lu Xiangtai, who was over 60 years old, was unable to escape and was crushed to death. Two Shaoxing merchants who were setting up foreign goods stalls near the shop also took refuge inside the building during the air raid and were crushed to death. Coffins have already been prepared for them. The area is the most prosperous commercial district in Jinhua, and it has now been turned into a field of rubble by the Japanese planes. According to an investigation, more than 60 bombs were dropped, including two incendiary bombs. More than 150 men and women civilians have been confirmed dead or injured. Those who have not been excavated or who have sustained minor injuries and sought medical attention or bandaged themselves have not yet been counted. Approximately 200 houses were burned, bombed, or damaged by shockwaves. Among the injured civilians, 51 were sent to the Injured People's Hospital, 40 were sent to the Security Military Hospital, and 16 were sent to the Gospel Hospital. More than 60 men and women were killed on the spot. When reporters went to the disaster areas to investigate, families were preparing coffins for their relatives, wailing in grief. The bodies of those who were not claimed were still lying there, with incomplete limbs and exposed internal organs. The atrocities of the Japanese planes can be described as heinous. The county's Air Raid Emergency Relief Joint Office held an emergency meeting and decided to notify the victims of the disaster to register at the Jinhua Refugee General Station and to designate a location for shelter. The expenses will be temporarily paid by the Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Association and reimbursed by the Relief Association. Representatives from various agencies will be sent to the hospitals to express condolences to the injured.

Guerrilla warfare unfolds between Jiangsu and Shandong; Chinese troops arrive and launch a pincer attack on Japanese troops; fierce fighting in the Yishui and Zhucheng areas

A dispatch from Taixian reports that guerrilla warfare has now broken out in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong. The main force of the Chinese army has also arrived and is jointly launching a pincer attack on the Japanese army in Huaihai with the various large armies and self-defense forces on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong. They are also protecting armed civilians, destroying the Longhai Railway and the Zheng-Hai, Huai-Hai, and Huai-Xu highways section by section. The cities and transportation lines occupied by the Japanese army have been cut off by the Chinese army, making it impossible for them to coordinate. The Japanese army in Lianghuai is in a state of panic under the encirclement and surveillance of the Chinese army and has transported heavy weapons to Lianshui, showing signs of retreat.

The Japanese army along the Jiaoji Railway in southern Shandong has gradually increased since late March. Starting on the first of this month, more than 600 Japanese soldiers with six cannons, who had invaded south from Linyi, fled to the vicinity of Xinzhuang. A certain unit of the Chinese army advanced to the area north of Mazhan in Yishui to intercept them, and fierce fighting ensued. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses. In addition, more than 500 Japanese soldiers from Anqiu, with several cannons and 12 vehicles, advanced to Baoquan on March 26 and continued to invade south. On the first of this month, they arrived in the area south of Rizhao. Puppet troops also moved west. The Chinese army fought on two fronts and finally managed to repel the stubborn enemy, preventing them from invading south. The Chinese army has dispatched strong forces to monitor Linyi. At this moment, the Japanese army in southern Shandong is at the end of its rope.

### Regular Army Arrives in Yixing; Thug Wu Zizhen Executed by Firing Squad; Local People Rejoice at the Removal of a Great Evil

A dispatch from Yixing reports, according to reliable sources, that three divisions of the central regular army, led by General Shangguan Yunxiang, have recently arrived here. The numbers are the 70xth Division, the 10xth Division, and the 11xth Division, to strengthen the defense of Yixing. The Japanese army stationed in Yixing County and the areas of Heqiao and Caoqiao is deeply frightened. The soldiers of the three divisions passed through the highways within the Japanese defense zone and the cities and towns at night and reached the territory controlled by the Chinese army in the mountainous area of Zhangzhu. When they passed through the Japanese-occupied areas and towns, traitors reported to the Japanese army headquarters. However, the Japanese army not only ignored the report but also avoided them from afar. The area occupied by the Japanese army in Yixing is only the area through which the highway north of Yicheng connects Wujin, Wuxi, and Jiangyin. However, this area is a plain with many rivers and marshes and no mountains. All the mountainous areas are under the control of the Chinese army, and the Japanese army does not dare to go deep. As for the local administration in areas outside the highway, it is still under the central county government. The county government is located in the mountains of Zhangzhu, and all administrative functions are carried out as usual. The puppet county government in Yixing City is only a nominal entity, used by local thugs and pettifoggers to exploit the local people. The puppet county chief, Zang Lichen (said to be a small boss from a candy store in Shanghai), arbitrarily extorted money and has amassed tens of thousands. His only capable henchman is Wu Zizhen, a famous thug in Yixing. Since Wu became the puppet district chief of the Second District, he incited his lackeys to kidnap people for ransom, committing all kinds of evil. The local people suffered greatly. Because the Second District is known to be a wealthy area, Wu used his puppet power to extort as much as possible, collecting land taxes. The local people hated him to the bone. His puppet district office was located in Zhou Tieqiao, where more than 40 Japanese soldiers and 100 puppet police were stationed to use their special powers to extort money from the local people. The Japanese army was stationed in Zhuxi Elementary School in the town, and the headquarters was located in the Chen Xiaoshan's house next door. The puppet police were stationed in the district office and the City God Temple. After Wu became the puppet district chief, he recruited his cronies Pan Xingfen, Wang Shuhuai, Hang Erlang, and Zhang Mou to serve as his henchmen and handle the affairs of the district office. His method of collecting land taxes was not based on the number of mu of the tenant farmers but on their wealth as the standard for extortion. If they did not comply, he would incite the puppet police to detain the tenant farmers and extort ransom. The farmers were in a dark and hopeless situation, truly unable to live. Fortunately, Wu was recently arrested and executed by the guerrillas. The local people were overjoyed. Wu's various illegal acts were heard by the regular army stationed in Yixing. After an investigation confirmed the facts, a large detachment of soldiers from the 33rd Brigade was dispatched on the night of the 6th of this month (the eve of the Qingming Festival), setting out from a mountain somewhere and rushing to Zhou Tieqiao Town overnight to surround the town. The vanguard broke into South Street, first killing the puppet police on guard, and then surrounding and disarming the puppet police camp stationed in the puppet district office. These motley crews were caught off guard in their sleep, like a bolt from the blue, dumbfounded and obedient, handing over their weapons, a total of more than 60 old rifles. Another route went straight to the City God Temple by water. The puppet police in this unit also did not resist and were disarmed by the regular army and locked up in one place. Wu Zizhen's henchman Hang Erlang was arrested and confessed that Wu's secret residence was at Zhang Xiaofeng's place behind the Fangxian Tea Room on North Street (Zhang is the youngest daughter of the late gentry Zhang Rongpei). Pan Guoju led dozens of strong men straight to Wu's residence on North Street, forcing their way in. Wu was still asleep, lying neck to neck with his mistress Zhang Xiaofeng, enjoying a beautiful dream. When he heard the door kicked open and the strong men entering with guns, Wu was terrified and at a loss, only kowtowing and begging for his life. He was first forced to hand over more than 30,000 yuan of the puppet tax he had collected, and then Wu and his accomplices Wang Shuhuai and mistress Zhang Xiaofeng were put in handcuffs, like pigs and sheep being led into a slaughterhouse. At first, the three of them kowtowed and begged, and then, under the guns and blades, they were escorted away. At that time, the Japanese army stationed in Zhuxi Elementary School heard gunshots from the southwest and knew that something had happened. They fired machine guns randomly in the school, not daring to go out, only making empty threats. The Chinese army also responded with rifles around the perimeter to lure them out of their nests so that they could be ambushed and killed. However, the Japanese army was as timid as mice and never dared to open the door to resist, except for firing machine guns randomly. The Chinese army completed its mission and escorted Wu and the other four southward by water and land. When they reached the Shuimen Bridge about three miles from Zhou Tieqiao, Wu tried to escape again, jumping into the river in the hope of a lucky escape. However, with handcuffs on both hands, he could not swim in the water and was shot and killed in the river by soldiers. In the midst of the chaos, Wang Shuhuai and Zhang Xiaofeng seized the opportunity to escape, disappearing into the night and impossible to track. As for Hang Erlang, who was arrested, after interrogation, it was found that he was not a major perpetrator, and he was allowed to escape death, but he had to pay a fine for redemption. The next morning (7th), the Japanese army stationed in the town acted spiritedly, closing all the gates of the town, intending to search house by house. Later, after repeated mediation by small traitors, while they were still undecided, they suddenly heard that Wu's body had been found at the pier of the steamer station. The Japanese army ordered small traitors to buy a coffin worth 24 yuan and hastily collect the body, carrying it to the Fire God Temple for temporary placement. A trail of blood dripped along the way, and the spectators all clapped their hands and cheered.

### The Administration of Fujian Province in the Past Year (Continued) Focusing on Both Manpower and Material Resources

Regarding the work of concentrating material resources: (1) Increasing production: (1) Improving agricultural and food production, (2) Immigrating and reclaiming wasteland, (3) Cooperative production, (4) Improving farmland planning and water conservancy projects, (5) Improving the cotton textile industry, (6) Promoting tea production, (7) Paper industry management. (2) Protecting and continuing to develop agriculture, industry, and commerce. Assisting the iron industry is particularly active. There are more than 100 iron factories of various sizes in the province with weak capital and simple equipment. The provincial government assisted them in moving inland in July last year. In this way, production tools such as agricultural tools, water pumps, looms, flour mills, oil presses, and auto parts can be manufactured using the factories relocated inland, so that production tools will not be lacking due to the war, and the factories can maintain their original business. (3) Facilitating transportation and regulating material resources. For the sake of consolidating national defense and long-term resistance against Japan, on the one hand, the coastal highways of the province are thoroughly destroyed or prepared to be destroyed. On the other hand, efforts should be made to develop inland transportation in order to plan a flexible wartime transportation mechanism and facilitate the transportation of rear resources. (4) Controlling material resources and preventing aiding the enemy. Fujian has a "Fujian Provincial Products Trading Company," which was recently reorganized into "Fujian Provincial Trading Company," specializing in the export of the province's specialties and the purchase of goods needed by the province, and undertaking the business of entrusting and transporting goods in various places. Offices have been established successively in Nanping, Pucheng and other places outside the province and in the province. National goods stores have been established in Nanping and Yong'an to promote the use of national goods, and wood and tea departments have been added to handle wood and tea sales, so that the province can reasonably control the goods exported to Japan. Regarding the issue of food management, the interim measures for food regulation and the province's regulations on food box transportation announced by the central government are handled separately, and a food bureau is established to be responsible for food storage and regulation, the investigation of transportation forces and tools near warehouses, the registration of food merchants, processing plants, and warehouses in the province, the organization and reorganization of food agencies in counties and districts, the investigation and registration of food exports and imports in counties and districts, and the promotion of brown rice, etc. Therefore, the food management of this province is becoming increasingly strict. (5) Conserving material resources. The administrative expenses of the province are being tightened to meet the needs of the anti-war economy, and three major principles of wartime finance have been decided: (1) Use the income from existing operations to maintain future recurring expenditures, so as to balance recurring revenue and expenditures. (2) Use other sources of revenue as rear service expenditures, so as to avoid shaking the foundation of normal administration. (3) Postpone the repayment of some old debts and reduce interest to reduce the current burden, and continue to repay some debts as usual to maintain credit. According to this principle, the number of estimates originally compiled last year has been reduced by one-third, but what has been reduced is administrative expenses, and the construction costs of production undertakings have not been reduced very much.

### Youth Should Possess Good Morals and Healthy Sexual Function

‚Äî Yang Daonan, Graduate of Medical Science from a Russian Labor University

Among the noble desires of youth, none is greater than cultivating a complete personality to shoulder the heavy responsibilities of future society. Likewise, among the responsibilities of adulthood, none is more important than making good use of one's innate talents and the cultivation received through education to bear the immense burdens of society. It is regrettable that the majority of today's youth, despite possessing good intentions and correct desires, ultimately succumb to base temptations due to weak morals and a careless mindset, coupled with a lack of sexual knowledge. They develop undesirable habits and indulge in self-destructive behaviors. Within a few years, both their physical and mental well-being are bankrupt, and some even contract diseases and lose the will to live. This is the harm caused by indulgence.

In the imaginations of young people, they generally believe that there is a most mysterious and powerful impulse within the human body, an irresistible force of attraction toward the opposite sex. Even their bodies and minds are often driven by it. When these feelings first awaken and reason is not yet fully developed, there are often bad companions who broadly misinterpret their own sexual experiences, sometimes even forcing them to engage in imitative experiments. The result of these experiments is only shame and self-reproach. Therefore, some young people often deeply regret their past mistakes, cherish their purity, and resolve to overcome temptations, and they will still be useful people in the future. However, there are also many young people who repeatedly make mistakes, and although they know it is wrong, they still associate with bad friends, often indulging in sexual desires due to momentary evil thoughts. Premature ejaculation and impotence result, and their married life is plunged into suffering.

Countless young people, due to self-abandonment, contract masturbation habits or become dissipated and degenerate, leading to the outbreak of sexual dysfunction and neurasthenia. Based on my many years of clinical experience in treating such diseases, the most effective treatment is glandular endocrine therapy. Patients can purchase and take "Body-Con," a genuine chimpanzee testicular essence preparation for men produced in Germany, three times a day. It is indeed effective in nourishing the brain, kidneys, and blood. This is because the agent is rich in animal testicular essence and also contains brain-nourishing phosphorus and metabolism-promoting papaya, so the effect is five to twenty-five times better than similar preparations on the market. However, during treatment, one should abstain from masturbation. Those with spermatorrhea can take "Naires Anti-Spermatorrhea Tablets" to stop it. For women experiencing post-marital infertility, menstrual irregularities, or breast health issues, taking "Body-Con" for women can achieve rejuvenation effects. I have proven this in clinical experiments. Most similar preparations on the market are not good and have significant gastrointestinal side effects, but "Body-Con" truly lives up to its name and has a remarkable anti-aging effect when taken regularly.

### The Cure of Masturbation and Spermatorrhea

‚Äî Zheng Ting, Doctor of German Medicine

Patient Ma Wenjie, 21 years old, from Changzhou, works in a factory. He is fond of wine and women. At the age of seventeen, he was tempted by bad friends to engage in masturbation to satisfy his desires, which became a habit over time. He masturbated at least two or three times every night, and the consumption of his essence and blood was immeasurable. After more than a year, spermatorrhea was discovered, but he could not quit masturbation. At this time, although he had taken sperm-locking pills on the market, they had no effect at all, and he also had the phenomenon of sperm flowing when seeing beautiful women during the day. Subsequently, neurasthenia symptoms such as brain weakness, tinnitus, forgetfulness, and insomnia arose. He came to me for treatment. I ordered him to quit the bad habit of masturbation, strictly follow hygiene practices, and avoid stimulants such as tobacco and alcohol. He underwent electrotherapy for 15 minutes every day and was ordered to take "Naires Anti-Spermatorrhea Tablets" to strengthen his sperm gates and treat spermatorrhea. He was also given "Body-Con," a German testicular essence preparation for men, to nourish the deficiencies and treat various neurasthenia symptoms caused by masturbation and spermatorrhea. Mr. Ma followed my instructions. Within a month, spermatorrhea and spermatorrhea were gone. After two months, neurasthenia symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, tinnitus, and insomnia were completely gone. After three months, all symptoms disappeared, and he gained weight, his complexion became rosy, and he regained his inherent health.

Modern Medicine

### Gonorrhea is Not Incurable

‚Äî Lecture by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

For any disease, if it is not a terminal illness, there is ultimately a cure. However, this cure must be in harmony with the illness. The treatment of gonorrhea is also the same. The gonococcus is indeed extremely stubborn, but it is not an incurable disease. However, because this bacterium is good at spreading and scurrying around, general local chemical therapies and membrane-penetrating sterilization therapies are difficult to achieve results. This was proven in my clinical practice when I studied medicine in the United States. However, if one can take a medicine that causes the body to produce an anti-gonococcal toxin, allowing it to exert its full power to encircle and suppress gonococci and completely eliminate all gonococci, then all gonorrhea, such as chronic leukorrhea or newly onset leukorrhea, and other complications, can be directed as desired and completely cured. How can it be said that gonorrhea is incurable?

"Kelinong" is a medicine invented by Dr. Peter of Germany and has been tested and analyzed in various countries around the world, proving that it has special effects. This is because "Kelinong" is made of a mixture of yellow pigment and protein. After taking it, each cell can automatically exert an anti-gonococcal and bactericidal effect within a few minutes. However, this effect does not hinder the physiological functions of healthy parts and cannot be compared with inferior drugs with strong side effects. This is because "Kelinong" directly attacks and destroys gonococci at the lesion site, which is not achieved by any oral medication for gonorrhea. It is appropriate that European and American doctors unanimously promote and enthusiastically praise this agent. According to Dr. Fink, director of the Gonorrhea Department of a German venereal disease hospital, "Kelinong" has cured more than tens of millions of gonorrhea patients in the past decade. Its achievements are indeed beyond the reach of general oral medications for gonorrhea. For gonococcal prostatitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, orchitis, cystitis, and leukorrhea in women, taking "Kelinong" all has unexpected special effects. In terms of external medications, women can use "Carder Snow Di Yin Dao Pian" as suppositories, and take "Kelinong" internally. In men, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" can be used externally according to the diagram and instructions to treat themselves at home. After a short period, they can be completely cured. To say that gonorrhea is incurable is a deceitful and unbelievable statement.

### Lung Disease and Hemoptysis

‚Äî Sheng Zaiqiang, Physician

Hemoptysis in lung disease is due to the fragility of blood vessels in the affected parts. It is caused by rupture of the blood vessels due to exercise and coughing, resulting in hemoptysis symptoms. Tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and all disease changes progress extremely slowly. However, hemoptysis is its actual onset, so effective treatment must be taken and absolutely cannot be neglected. However, in theory and experience, hemoptysis is not an absolutely critical condition, but it cannot be regarded as a minor symptom. According to my more than 20 years of experience, "Bu Fei Kong Er" can increase the patient's own resistance and shrink the lesions, causing the bacteria to die from encirclement and confinement. Therefore, it can not only cure hemoptysis, but also eradicate the source of hemoptysis. I say that hemoptysis in lung disease is not terrible for this reason.

A Brief Exploration of Gonorrhea

### Infertility is Not the Wife's Fault

‚Äî Narrated by Yao Juyan, Physician

In today's society, where men and women are not yet completely equal, the responsibility for having no children is often placed on the female partner. Even when a man suffers from gonococcal prostatitis and becomes infertile, it is blamed on the woman. This is a judgment that often inverts the facts. In many cases of gonorrhea, it is often due to improper treatment of the patient or unreasonable intraurethral injections, which lead to the gonococci being induced from the urethra into the prostate ducts, and from this main duct, they spread into dozens of glands. As a result, gonococci multiply and produce offspring everywhere, secreting toxic fluids. The prostate gland becomes inflamed due to this gonococcal toxic stimulus, which is prostatitis. However, in the initial stage, only the part of the prostate gland adjacent to the urethra is inflamed, and the seminal vesicles are not subjected to gonococcal destruction, maintaining their ability to secrete fluid and aid sperm activity. If the patient abandons treatment or the treatment is not effective, the gonococci gradually spread to all parts of the prostate gland, causing the entire excretory duct of the prostate gland to completely lose its function and become blocked. Once the secretory function of the prostate gland is completely stopped, the wife will naturally have no possibility of conception. I have encountered this symptom very often. There was a Mr. Li, a middle-aged man who had gonorrhea at the age of twenty-six. Although he was treated afterwards, it was never completely cured. Since then, his wife has not conceived, and he suspected that his wife was infertile. After my treatment, I learned that he had prostatitis, so I used German static electricity therapy for him and administered "Kelinong." Within five weeks, the gonococci were completely eliminated. Last month, his friend Mr. Wang came to me for treatment for sexual neurasthenia and said that after Mr. Li's treatment at my clinic, his wife became pregnant and is about to give birth.

Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, twenty tickets will be issued each day, with each ticket costing only five cents.

### Charity Basketball Second Battle: China Youth Loses Again by One Point, Fuyou Wins Again 34 to 33, Women's Qixiu Wins Chongde Again

The second charity basketball game between China Youth and Yeyou started at 8:30 last night at China Youth.

First, the women's Qixiu and Chongde competed. After the start, Chongde's momentum was extremely strong, leading by as many as ten points with 18 to 8 in the first half. However, their lineup fell apart later. In the last few minutes, Qixiu relied on Zhang Jiapei's throw to come back to life. Chongde suffered a second defeat. The game between China and Fudan was very tense. China Youth unfortunately suffered too many losses during the adjustment in the first half. Although they tried hard to catch up in the final battle, they failed to surpass and lost by one point. The tightness of the battle was enough to be thrilling. In addition, the veteran teams of Fudan and Guanghua have been organized and are scheduled to practice at China Youth at 7:30 tonight.

Qixiu Wins Again: Chongde relied on penalty points to open the record first. After that, it went smoothly, with the first quarter becoming 6 to 3, and leading with 18 to 8 in the first half. After the change of sides, Qixiu tried to counterattack, and Zhang Jiapei was extremely active, chasing to 15 to 18, only three points behind. In the last quarter, the atmosphere was extremely tense. Qixiu gradually caught up, and Liu Zhenbao's shot made it 25 points each. Yan Weiwen shot in a goal, and Qixiu took the lead. Zhang Jiapei made a good comeback, and Qixiu was able to defeat Chongde again with 29 to 27.

China Youth Suffers a Miserable Defeat

The main battle was unveiled. Fuyou fought with Zhang Jinxiang, Da Mao Cai Yanxiong, Zhou Dayun, and Chen Xuesong as the strongest lineup. China Youth was Yuliang, Jusheng, Xilin, Kong Guangyi, and Dong Yangfeng. Dayun made one of two penalty shots, opening the record. The two sides came and went very quickly, making it 6 points each, and then 11 points each for the third time. At that time, China Youth changed to a wheel-fighting method. Except for Kong Guangyi, the other four were replaced by Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, Chen Xianglong, and Ren Xiangcheng. Unexpectedly, it backfired, and the situation took a sharp turn. Fuyou had an advantage of 15 to 11. China Youth hurriedly called down Shen Yugong in a hurry, but it was useless. In the first half, it ended up lagging behind with 13 to 19. After changing sides, Fuyou changed to Lu Dazhen. China Youth made amends and still dealt with the five people at the beginning of the game. China Youth indeed saw improvement. Xu Jusheng and Zhiliang were unstoppable. In an instant, they scored eight points in a row, and the difference was close to 21 to 25. The situation was ever-changing. At this time, both sides were eager to win and fell into a melee. Zhang Jinxiang made atonement and threw the ball into the basket, making the score 30 to 27. Soon after, Kong Guangyi committed four fouls and was dismissed, replaced by Zhuo Guorong. Dazhen made both penalty shots, making it 34 to 27. Although China Youth tried to retaliate, with Li Zhenzhong on the field, Xu Jusheng made a penalty shot, chasing to 34 to 33, a difference of one point. Just as they were about to take advantage of the momentum, time waited for no one, and the bell rang, resulting in a disastrous defeat.

### Public Concession: Record of the Annual Meeting of Foreign Ratepayers: Passing Last Year's Accounts and This Year's Budget, Improving the Western District Authorized the General Works Bureau to Handle It, General Manager Fankeling Made a Concise Report

This year's annual meeting of foreign ratepayers was held at 2:30 PM yesterday at the Grand Guangming Cinema. The attending directors were Fankeling (General Manager), Mai Kenuodeng (Deputy General Manager), Gao Nixu, Kaiziwei, Mai Tangnaer, Masu Si, Miqi Han, Gang Ben, and Shan Ban. The attending staff were Feixindun (President), Feilipu (General Office), and Fute (Finance Director).

Later, someone temporarily proposed to improve education in the concession and increase the funding for medical institutions. Because it was related to Motion 7, it was included in the discussion of that motion. It did not disperse until 5:20 PM.

### General Manager Fankeling's Speech

The following is an abstract of General Manager Fankeling's speech: I am honored to serve as the General Manager of the Public Works Bureau, and my one-year term is about to expire. It is my duty to propose Motion 6 and ask you to approve the bureau's report and accounts up to December 31, 1938. This annual meeting of taxpayers indicates that another municipal year of the bureau has come to an end amid arduous struggles. In the past year, the bureau has encountered various problems, which contain very difficult and complex natures. The matters involved include refugee relief, food and fuel management, Bund wharf facilities, opening factories in the residential area of the western district, recovering the administrative rights of Hongkou, and suppressing terrorist incidents, etc. As for the various ongoing problems that the bureau must pay attention to at all times, there is no need to elaborate. Today, I do not want to describe all the matters one by one. Most of these matters have been explained in detail in the bureau's 1938 annual report. The public who are concerned about the administrative status of the bureau can pay attention to the above-mentioned annual report. What I intend to state should be limited to certain matters that can be considered particularly important or require more detailed explanation or explanation. There are some events that are deeply concerned by the general public, but due to the special internationality and international relations of the Public Concession, it is inconvenient to discuss them freely at the meeting.

Terrorist Incidents

Terrorist incidents are a problem that the public has paid much attention to recently. Those who use assassination as a political weapon do so not only in China, but also in the chaotic situation of today's so-called civilized world. Political assassinations often occur in various countries. This kind of crime is caused by secret actions and cannot be prevented or curbed. Based on our experience, it is undoubtedly impossible for any country to eradicate this kind of crime, even if it has the most highly trained and most efficient police agency. In the past year or so, there have been more political assassinations in the Public Concession. These crimes are not limited to one group or one party. Some of them show a trend of returning to the Middle Ages. This trend is truly shocking in the modern situation.

The bureau's police officers already haveÁπÅÂäá(heavy and complex) work, but some people say that they are unable to completely prevent the occurrence of political crimes during this extraordinary period. I think this harsh criticism is inappropriate. The environment in which the bureau's police officers perform their duties is unique in the world. The area they serve has suffered from war, and the deep-seated hatred caused by the war is brewing secretly. The population in this area is very dense, and countless narrow streets and alleys can lead in all directions, thus naturally becoming a breeding ground for criminals and bandits. Moreover, people from all sides can easily enter due to the terrain and environment. These facts cannot be ignored. The Japanese authorities feel the importance and difficulty of this issue and have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the bureau's police officers to curb terrorist incidents. On the one hand, the bureau does not recognize that the bureau's police officers can be subject to any restrictions. On the other hand, it is willing to cooperate with the Japanese side in the most friendly spirit, but on one condition, that is, any cooperation method must be agreed upon by the head of the bureau's police department and implemented after consultation with him. In other words, the police power belonging exclusively to the police officers of the Public Concession in the areas actually not under the command of the army within the Public Concession should be preserved. Agencies not belonging to the Public Concession Police Department shall not exercise police power in those areas. Exercising surprise power in each area

Salaries of Employees

The salary issue of the bureau's employees has also been noticed by the public and has aroused much comment. During the past year, the fall in the exchange rate of Chinese legal currency and the post-war situation have caused the cost of living in the concession to soar. Therefore, the bureau has reviewed the salary schedule of employees from time to time, and in June and July, it approved the issuance of special living allowances to Chinese and foreign employees of lower grades. By the end of last year, the cost of living was still rising, so that the bureau had to plan the salary issue more thoroughly. Moreover, the salaries given to employees by the bureau were quite low when converted into foreign currency, which made it more difficult for the bureau to recruit professional talents. At the same time, the bureau also heard that some senior professionals also intended to resign because of this. After the bureau's Committee on Assessment and Remuneration considered this issue, it decided to increase the living allowance for low-level employees and approve Class A employees to receive full exchange allowances according to one-third of their salary. This method has been approved by the bureau's board of directors. In order to easily attract contracted employees and prevent professional personnel from resigning, the bureau also passed a motion to improve the treatment of twenty senior employees. There is a lot of misunderstanding about this matter from the outside world. I want to state here that the bureau's improvement of the treatment of these senior employees is not to compensate for their living expenses. The bureau's intention is to make the salaries of at least some personnel equal to the salaries of personnel who work in Shanghai and elsewhere and have the same ability and bear the same responsibilities, so that the personnel who are currently employed and those who are planning to be hired in the future can work with peace of mind. Any taxpayer who has studied this issue and knows the salaries of civil servants in other major cities in the world can admit that the income of the current senior employees of the bureau is still less than that of the same-level employees who serve elsewhere. After the bureau's resolution was announced, the public criticized it. In order to listen to the opinions of taxpayers as much as possible, the bureau hired business people to form a committee to review the bureau's resolution and express its opinions. Xuan Shan, a member of the committee, submitted a report and suggestions. The committee agreed with the bureau's method of issuing allowances to the lowest-level employees, but did not approve of the bureau's method of giving preferential treatment to the highest-level employees. It suggested that all Class A employees should receive a living allowance in addition to the exchange allowance that the bureau has already approved. This suggestion was adopted by the bureau. The bureau reduced the salaries of senior employees and should notify them six months in advance according to the regulations, but each of these employees voluntarily gave up their rights, so the suggestions of the special committee could be implemented immediately. What taxpayers should pay attention to is that the committee did not comment on whether the basic salary schedule set by the bureau is appropriate. The current applicable salary schedule is based on the recommendations of the Employees' Economic Committee. When the committee was meeting, there was hope that the exchange rate would be stable for a long period of time. The amount of salary was determined based on this fact and the situation at that time. Any salary schedule cannot be applicable in all situations, even when drastic changes occur in the exchange rate and general situation. According to the land regulations, taxpayers and the bureau have their own responsibilities. The bureau is responsible for hiring employees and determining the amount of their salaries. Regarding this matter, there is one thing to remember, that is, the municipal administration of the Public Concession has an international nature. The bureau should maintain the standard level of municipal administration. On the taxpayer side, you should know that the bureau sometimes has to revise a part of the salary schedule. The bureau must hire new employees with the ability to handle affairs to compensate for the death, resignation, or dismissal of employees. If possible, these employees should be hired locally. Otherwise, they must be hired from abroad. At that time, if the amount of salary promised by the bureau is the same as the current one, it may not be possible to find satisfactory talents. Unless the value of Chinese legal currency has an unforeseeable rise at present, the bureau may have to consider how to increase the amount of basic salary when it encounters such situations.

This year, two of the bureau's highest-level employees will retire, one is the bureau's president, Mr. Feixindun, and the other is the bureau's finance director, Mr. Fute.

President's Retirement

Mr. Feixindun was elected as a director of the bureau in 1930 and served continuously until 1929. He served as the bureau's general manager between 1923 and 1929. Since 1929, he has served as the president. During the two years of 1925 and 1927, the bureau was in a troubled time. Fortunately, Mr. Fei led his colleagues to overcome the difficulties. The work of Mr. Fei as president is naturally of a confidential nature and cannot be fully understood by taxpayers, but his colleagues who are close to him all know that his contributions are of great value. Every general manager has relied on Mr. Fei and consulted him for his opinions. Mr. Fei is calm, far-sighted, familiar with the history of Shanghai, and has a deep understanding of law. Therefore, the value of his service is very important. The bureau's colleagues express their respect. Mr. Fei will retire this year, and it is a pity. Fortunately, Mr. Fei does not intend to leave Shanghai far away and can still guide him at any time, which is gratifying.

Finance Director's Retirement

Mr. Fute, the bureau's finance director, will also retire before the board of directors adjourns this year. Mr. Fu has been the acting finance director since 1924. In 1928, he was officially appointed as the finance director. The responsibilities of the bureau's finance department have been increasing during Mr. Fu's tenure. In 1928, the bureau's budget for both regular and special expenditures was 38 million yuan, while this year's budget is more than 82.5 million yuan. The bureau's tax stock in the general office has been transferred to the finance department since 1932. Therefore, Mr. Fu's duties are even more difficult. During Mr. Fu's tenure, the bureau has signed extremely important agreements with several public utility companies. Mr. Fu has participated in the negotiations on these agreements. Mr. Fu joined the bureau in 1908. In that year, the bureau's regular income was 3 million yuan, and the value of its assets was 12 million yuan. This year, the bureau's regular income is 28 million yuan, and the value of its assets is 170 million yuan. The financial credit of the Public Concession is outstanding, and thanks should be expressed to Mr. Fu for this. Mr. Fu could have retired in 1936, but he continued to serve until now because the bureau retained him.

Last Year's Accounts

The accounts of the last year have been explained in detail in the finance director's report. Looking at the final accounts, you can see that the amount of the deficit in that year was reduced by more than 782,000 yuan compared with the budget deficit. The main reason for this is that the amount of donations and taxes collected in the second half of the year increased significantly. The reasons for the increase in donations and taxes are, first, the development of industry in the western district, and second, the reduction of vacant houses south of the Suzhou River. However, at the same time, the drop in the value of Chinese legal currency has caused the bureau's expenditures to increase quite a lot, especially expenditures such as pensions and retirement allowances. In addition, the living allowances given to employees by the bureau were not included in the original budget. As for the facilities of the bureau's various departments, they are all subject to considerable restrictions. Some works have been temporarily shelved due to the poor environment, so the expenses are relatively low. As for the various measures of the public works, they are quite significant, but the expenditures of the health department exceed the budget. A part of the expenses directly spent on refugee relief has been offset by the funds withdrawn from the entertainment donation. As for the various special expenditures, they are also limited. The public works that have been carried out are only the essential ones. However, due to the continued existence of the emergency situation, the bureau's emergency expenses have exceeded the budget by a lot. The bureau's investment bank has absorbed fixed deposits since the beginning of last year. The results of this kind of short-term turnover method have been listed in the annual report.

This Year's Accounts

The budget for the year 1939 has been sent to you for review a few days ago. The budget is attached with a detailed explanatory note, so I only need to raise a few points for your attention. On March 8 this year, the bureau's board of directors held a meeting to discuss how to balance this year's regular budget. According to the budget opened by the finance director, if the bureau collects donations at the current donation rate, the deficit will be 3 million yuan in national currency. Various expenses have been reduced as much as possible within a seemingly feasible range. As for the income, it is estimated with a reasonably optimistic eye. The total amount of budgeted expenditures is about 5.7 million yuan more than last year. The reason for the sharp increase is almost entirely due to the drop in the value of the national currency. The bureau expects that the reduction of vacant houses, the development of industry, and the increase in franchise fees payable by various public utility companies can increase income, but the two are offset and still feel insufficient. In order to balance this budget, the finance director intends to ask the bureau to increase the ordinary house donation and the special house damage donation rate in the boundary area by 2% each from July 1 this year, and to increase the land tax at the same ratio from the same date. The remaining shortage of 1.75 million yuan can

## Page 10

be compensated in the same way as the deficit in the previous two years. The director's recommendation has been reviewed and approved by the Finance Committee. If the bureau can maintain its credit and enable various major municipal works to proceed as usual, it is not willing to increase donations at this time. However, after the board of directors carefully considered all aspects of this issue, it believed that the increase in donations must be implemented this year. However, in order to notify taxpayers in advance so that taxpayers can prepare, it was decided to change the date of commencement of the increase in donations to October this year. According to the current proposed method, the donations and taxes additionally collected from taxpayers this year are approximately equal to 3% of the actual amount paid by taxpayers last year. If calculated on a full-year basis, it will increase by approximately 12 and a half percent compared to last year. The price of goods and public utilities in this city has risen by more than this amount in the past nine months. Now, calculated by the income after the increase in donations from October 1, there is still a shortage of approximately 2.3 million yuan in the budget, which must be prepared. The bureau intends to follow the precedent of the previous two years and withdraw this amount from the reserve fund, so as to balance the budget. As for the amount withdrawn, it should be returned from the surplus in the future budget or compensated by other fundraising methods. What you should pay attention to is that the reserve fund that the bureau can dispose of is not inexhaustible. In fact, the amount of this reserve fund is quite limited. Therefore, any opinion that someone has that the reserve fund should be used up is not something I dare to agree with. The education expenditure for this year totals 2,354,000 yuan, an increase of 351,240 yuan compared to last year. This amount is approximately equal to one-seventh of the house donation and land tax collected by the bureau. Regarding the special budget, there is one thing that can be stated to you, that is, the bureau's construction plan has been reduced to the minimum limit. The expenses for handling various emergency affairs, paying off public debts, and compensating for this year's deficit have all been included in this budget. Now, I intend to ask you to allow the bureau to raise funds up to 12 million yuan. This amount may not be fully raised. The fundraising method used should be considered by the next board of directors.

### Foreign Ratepayers' Meeting: Difficult to Write About the Meeting Place

The annual foreign ratepayers' meeting was held at the Grand Guangming Cinema at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The Westerners who attended the meeting were seated in the upper and lower seats, totaling more than 1,000 people, wearing Western suits and leather shoes, young and old gathered together. Outside the gate, there was a Western-language white cloth banner of the Western Ratepayers' Association. Before the meeting, Chinese and Western detectives gathered together and pointed out the seats to the people entering the venue, which was very thoughtful. On the left side of the rostrum, there were seven seats for Chinese newspaper reporters, and on the right side, there were seats for Western newspaper reporters. The seats on the rostrum were H-shaped. In the middle was the seat of Chairman Mo Shaopu, and on the left and right were the seats of the directors of the Public Works Bureau. The Japanese directors Gang Ben and Shan Ban were seated on the right side of the rostrum. Yesterday, Mr. Kaiziwei, a director of the Public Works Bureau, wore a formal dress to the venue, and his dignified demeanor was noticed by the people in the audience. There were only two participants in the audience who wore Chinese clothing, namely Mr. Zhu Guilin, a reporter from the Huaji Xinsheng Society in the side hall, and a reporter from this newspaper, which can be said to be unique. There were many Western reporters who attended, and there was also a Western female reporter, who also temporarily sat in the seat of the Chinese newspaper reporters. The venue was equipped with a sound system, and the sound was exceptionally clear. Yesterday, the person who spoke the most at the meeting was Mr. Fankeling, the Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, who reported on the administrative situation of the Public Works Bureau for as long as one and a half hours. The audience held their breath and watched attentively. After the report, the crowd applauded warmly. When discussing the various motions, Mr. Stewart, an attendee, stated that he did not fully agree with the proposed budget increase of the Public Works Bureau and posted two papers explaining his opinions next to his seat. When he stated his opinions, he poured tea while speaking, and his attitude was quiteÊ¥íËÑ±(unrestrained); but the result of the case, after public discussion, was not established.

### French Concession Yesterday: Interference with County Flag Incident - National Flag Returned After Negotiation, Those Arrested Promised Release

Yesterday was the Farmer-Industrial-Commercial sector propaganda day of the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. All sectors of the city telegraphed greetings and comfort to Chairman Chiang, wishing for final victory. From 7 a.m. yesterday morning, all major stores and households in the Public Concession and the French Concession uniformly and voluntarily raised the national flag as a concrete expression of citizens implementing the National Spiritual Mobilization. The atmosphere was unusually enthusiastic. However, the French Concession authorities interfered with the flag-raising by stores within the concession. From 9 a.m. yesterday, the French police dispatched large numbers of detectives to various roads to advise stores to take down the national flag. However, stores along Avenue Joffre and other areas protested, stating that it concerned national dignity and sovereignty, and refused to comply. Unexpectedly, Russian and Annamese police forcibly took down the flags displayed by the stores. However, after the Annamese police left, the stores re-hung the flags. As a result, the detectives compelled the stores to hand over the national flags and took them back to the police station. However, driven by enthusiasm, the stores purchased more new flags and raised them again. Their spirit of perseverance fully demonstrated the fervent patriotism of the citizens.

Dispute Causes Store Closures

However, the French police continued to send large numbers of detectives to continue interfering. An apprentice at the Da Guangming Underwear Store in the West Xinqiao area was beaten in an argument with an Annamese policeman, and the store owner was arrested. Others, such as the Tai Kang Food Company, Guan Sheng Yuan, Wang Da You, Zhong Hui Underwear Company, He Ming Shoe and Hat Store, Shanghai Hat Store, Hong Da Mat Store, Tong Sheng Rice Store, Mei Ya Watch Store, Wu He Weaving Factory, An Da Sock Factory, and Tian Xiang Zhai Cake Shop, had their national flags forcibly taken away. Furthermore, the glass storefront of the He Ji Food Store on Ximen Road was smashed by police. Approximately forty people were arrested in total. As a result, all the stores automatically closed. As of last night when the draft was being written, all stores east of Ba Xianqiao and west of Dengjia Muqiao had successively closed. The Golden Theater cancelled tickets last night and temporarily suspended performances to express its determination. Several stores, such as Nanyang Western Clothing Store, on Avenue Edward VII, also closed.

Dispatching Personnel for Negotiations Leads to Satisfactory Result

After the above incident occurred, various organizations in this port, upon hearing the news, were deeply saddened. In addition to sending personnel to comfort the interfered-with stores and households, they also dispatched representatives to negotiate with the French authorities. It is reported that the French authorities have agreed to completely release the arrested personnel and return all the confiscated national flags. The National Spiritual Mobilization Association headquarters' letter to the compatriots of the city is transcribed as follows: "To the people of the city, yesterday (the 19th) was the Farmer-Industrial-Commercial sector propaganda day of the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. Citizens from all walks of life in our city unanimously raised flags, and the situation was enthusiastic, which is commendable. Unexpectedly, the French Concession authorities interfered, arrested citizens, and confiscated national flags. This unfriendly behavior is deeply regrettable. However, our compatriots, despite being unjustly interfered with, displayed a heroic and unyielding spirit, witnessed by Chinese and foreigners alike. This unwavering attitude is a concrete manifestation of the National Spiritual Mobilization of the citizens of this city. Currently, various civic groups in this city have urgently telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting serious negotiations with the French Ambassador to China, in order to strengthen the friendly relations between China and France. This matter should achieve a satisfactory outcome. We hope that our compatriots will await the government's resolution and jointly maintain social order. We are fortunate, we are fortunate." Headquarters of the Shanghai Citizens' National Spiritual Mobilization Association.

Proclamation by the French Concession Authorities

The French Concession authorities issued the following proclamation regarding the flag-raising dispute: "Regarding this proclamation, it is hereby known that any government demonstration or movement is strictly prohibited within this concession. Such demonstrations are clearly intended to cause trouble and are instigated by troublemakers who disrupt public order and safety. While respecting individual opinions, this authority has the responsibility to take necessary steps to maintain the absolute neutrality of the concession and the peace and tranquility of its residents. If necessary, troublemakers will be expelled. Regarding collective flag-raising, except on National Day, all acts of a political demonstration nature are especially prohibited. It is specially declared that all residents must be aware. This is imperative."

Armed Patrols Create a Serious Situation

After the stores on Avenue Joffre successively closed, the French police, fearing an incident, dispatched large numbers of Russian and Annamese police to be stationed at key intersections on various roads. At the same time, armored vehicles and fast cars were deployed for patrols to suppress crowds gathering and inspect pedestrians. The situation was very serious, especially in the area in front of the Golden Theater.

### Spiritual Mobilization Committee Encourages City Youth with Four Key Points to Mutually Encourage and Share the Responsibility of Saving and Building the Nation - Today is Education Sector Propaganda Day

Today is the Education sector propaganda day of the National Spiritual Mobilization. In addition to holding large-unit teaching sessions on the outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization in all schools across the city and publishing special editions in various newspapers, the Education Sector National Spiritual Mobilization Association also issued a letter to the city's youth, which is excerpted as follows: "Young people are the pride of the times. They possess simple minds, intelligent brains, lively spirits, strong physiques, and a glorious revolutionary history. In China, whether it is politics, culture, or science, there is nothing that is not initiated, promoted, and transformed by young people, gradually reaching its goal. During the May Fourth Movement, our country's youth not only made brilliant contributions to the enlightenment of politics and culture, but also the majority of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang were young people. Subsequently, during the May 30th Movement, the September 18th Incident, and the January 28th Incident, there was not a single instance where young students were not actively agitating in the great tide of national salvation. From the tense situation in North China to the sound of gunfire at the Lugouqiao Incident, the actions of young people are especially worthy of excitement and encouragement. From the front lines to the rear, from regular warfare to guerrilla warfare, nearly hundreds of thousands of young people have endured the wind and rain, hunger and cold, rushing around and working hard, sacrificing themselves to save the country. In the history of national revolution, this is indeed worthy of special mention. But what about the young people on our isolated island? There are certainly those who are hardworking, dedicated, and strive for the country, but more than 80 percent of the youth are still living a life of hedonism, preserving their habits of seeking temporary safety, filled with a deathly atmosphere, neither seeking knowledge nor seeking action. Everything from the spirit of vigorous development, the determination to bravely move forward, the frugal and incorruptible customs, and the morality of loyalty and knowing shame has become as rare as the morning stars on the isolated island. Although there are over one million young people on the isolated island, the majority are actually waiting to be subjugated or waiting for the arrival of victory, willingly abandoning the sacred mission of saving and building the country during the Great Revolution. Even if they examine their consciences late at night and cannot help but feel ashamed, they will probably be cursed by later generations. Now, what we hope for from the city's youth are the following points:

Collective Struggle: The more society evolves, the more people's work becomes collective. Only collective work can generate enormous power. Saving and building the nation especially requires that all the people of the country be organized and mobilized within a group. The National Spiritual Mobilization is intended to use this group spirit and power to help the military resist the enemy and help the government build the nation, so that final victory can be achieved quickly and the nation can be restored. Therefore, young people must not only give up individualistic activities and enthusiastically participate in this group, but also automatically organize this group or promote and encourage others to participate in this group.

Unified Faith: China's War of Resistance is not only to achieve national independence and freedom, but also to simultaneously advance and concretely implement the Three Principles of the People: Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood. Since we are to build a free and happy new China based on the Three Principles of the People, then we must have a common faith in the Three Principles of the People, study the Three Principles of the People, propagate the Three Principles of the People, and strive to save the country for the Three Principles of the People. Furthermore, after having a common faith, we will certainly be able to move from mutual faith to mutual trust, making the national united front as strong as cement. Using this to eliminate the enemy, no enemy cannot be defeated. Using this to build the nation, what fear is there that we will not achieve our goal?

Concentrated Will: During the War of Resistance, after having a common faith, we must also have a common will, without divergence or confusion, moving forward towards a common goal, so that the enemy is weakened and shaken, and then collapses. The so-called common goal is that regardless of what kind of work or career, we must not be afraid of trouble and must carefully design it so that it helps the War of Resistance and benefits the country and the nation. In other words, we must at all times keep "the country above all, the nation above all, national affairs first, and victory first" in our hearts as the premise for all work and careers.

Life Reform: In addition to the above, personal habits and life also have a great impact on the War of Resistance and national construction. Waste in terms of economy and time will certainly weaken the economy of the War of Resistance and delay the time of victory, and being listless, complacent, mediocre, and romantic is more than enough to lead to national subjugation. Moreover, the soldiers on the front lines are sacrificing themselves for the nation, and countless compatriots are suffering for the country. How can we alone enjoy ourselves? As for the young people studying at school, they should especially be hardworking, energetic, and vigorous, set an example for other young people, work for the War of Resistance, and seek knowledge for national construction. From today onwards, we must jointly take on the responsibility of saving and building the nation, so that both economy and time can move forward on the road of revolution.

### Japanese Restrictions on Foreigners Traveling Between Shanghai and Hankou - Large Group of Russians Stranded for Half a Year Before Reaching Shanghai - Many Other Foreigners in Hankou Unable to Travel

The English-language "China Press" reports that forty-seven Russian men and women, stranded in Hankou since October last year, arrived in Shanghai on Sunday aboard a Japanese transport ship. Their businesses in Hankou were closed due to the war, and they had been trying to get to Shanghai for half a year. Although there were many Japanese merchant ships carrying passengers between Hankou and Shanghai, they were not permitted to board the transport ship until last week. It is reported that many other foreigners in Hankou are waiting to be transported to Shanghai, but have been unable to find a way to travel. At the same time, many foreigners in Shanghai have also been unable to travel to Hankou and other Yangtze River ports. Foreign merchants in Shanghai and Hankou have repeatedly expressed their dissatisfaction with the Japanese restrictions, but to no avail. It is reported that some trading firms feel that the restrictions on passenger traffic to and from the Yangtze River are causing extreme inconvenience. Staff members of foreign trading firms in Hankou who have reached the end of their terms are therefore unable to depart, and those who should be transferred there are also forced to remain in Shanghai. It is reported that it is easier for Chinese to travel to various Yangtze River ports than for foreigners. They can travel on Japanese merchant ships if they hold permits issued by the Japanese military authorities.

### President of Columbia University Mourns Xu Xinliu and Liu Zhanen - Praises the Perseverance of University Students - Intensifying World Situation Proves Moral Collapse

The "Continental Times" reports that yesterday (the 18th), this port received the 1938 annual report from Dr. Butler, President of Columbia University in New York City, and President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The report contains Dr. Butler's praise for the perseverance of Chinese university students in carrying out their work during wartime. The report also states that even amidst Japanese bombings and

air raids, Chinese international relations groups continued to work tirelessly. Amid rumors circulating in the surrounding countryside that Japanese bombers were approaching, they still sent several books and reports from their recent meeting to the Endowment's American office. The report also stated that the assassination of Dr. Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University, was a great loss, as Liu made contributions to international understanding. The death of Xu Xinliu, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Association of the Pacific Academic Conference, also caused setbacks to the work of international relations. Dr. Butler criticized the current international tensions, saying that people all hope for peace, and while both democratic and dictatorial governments claim to be committed to peace, countries around the world are engaging in military build-up. Dr. Butler found the explanation for this anomaly to be

the complete collapse of public morality, which has affected the policies and plans of governments. Furthermore, the people of democratic countries lack the wisdom and courage to firmly urge their governments to act in a constructive manner and eliminate the causes of war.

### Dinghai Passengers Return Home Safely - Endeavor Arrives in Ningbo - Ningbo is Peaceful

After the mouth of Zhenhai in Ningbo was ordered by Chairman Chiang to prohibit ships from entering and exiting from April 5th, the Italian merchant ship "Endeavor" of the Sino-Italian Company was specially permitted to transport 17,000 bags of wheat from Shanghai and sailed to Ningbo the day before yesterday. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Ningbo at 8 a.m. yesterday, but was delayed until around 11 a.m. due to heavy fog on the eastern Zhejiang waters. According to a telegram report from the "Endeavor," Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang is as peaceful as usual. After the wheat is unloaded, it will return to Shanghai immediately. The "Hanna" transported distressed Dinghai passengers from Shanghai and sailed to Dinghai the night before last. According to a telegram report today, it had docked at the Dinghai pier at 2 p.m. yesterday and will return to Shanghai from Dinghai at 4 p.m. today. Furthermore, the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters was ordered to restore the Ningbo Martial Law Headquarters, and Guo Chiping was concurrently appointed as Commander. This has been announced to the public.

### Accountants' Association Discusses Wartime Losses - Xi Yushu Proposes Supplementary Measures - To Serve as the Basis for Accounting Treatment

The Shanghai Accountants' Association held a regular board meeting yesterday to discuss Member Xi Yushu's letter proposing supplementary measures for dealing with wartime losses, requesting discussion, etc. It was decided that Member Xi's proposed points are related to the basis for accounting treatment after industrial and commercial enterprises have been affected by the war and should be submitted to the board for discussion and distributed to all members for their opinions. The original letter and supplementary measures are transcribed as follows: "Dear Sir, the four measures proposed by my member to the Ministry in the past were intended to consider the matter reasonably and to preserve the vitality of industry and commerce within the possible scope. Now that they have been approved by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce in the front and approved by the Ministry in the rear, I will again contribute my humble opinion and propose several supplementary measures for handling wartime losses, hoping for a public decision: (1) The scope of wartime losses: all wartime damage to fixed assets and inventory. Fixed assets should be listed as losses based on their original cost minus accumulated depreciation. Inventory should be listed at book value (if reserves have been made, it should be the book value minus the reserves). Accounts receivable in the war zone that cannot be recovered may also be listed as wartime losses. (2) Evaluation of fixed assets located in the war zone that have not been moved out and still exist: calculate the degree of damage proportionally or invite experts to appraise. The remaining amount should be listed as war zone assets, and the damaged portion should be included in wartime losses. (3) Wartime losses should account for a maximum of three-fifths of the capital (original text submitted to the Ministry). Only those enterprises with obvious prospects for recovery can be included in deferred assets. Otherwise, if the amount of wartime losses exceeds three-fifths or more, a shareholders' meeting should be convened to discuss increasing capital or reducing capital. (4) Enterprises that have suffered wartime losses should first use their public reserves and various reserves to offset them. If there is still an insufficient amount after the offset, it should be listed as deferred assets. (5) Various relocation costs of fixed assets during wartime changes should be listed as expenses if they are small and affordable. If such expenses do not exceed 30% of the original cost, they should be added to the value of the fixed assets. If the amount of expenses is very large, they should be listed as wartime losses and treated as deferred assets. (6) Enterprises with sufficient financial resources, constant surplus capacity, and profits should retain more profits after paying income tax, in addition to appropriately allocating official profits, and should allocate more to amortize losses to consolidate strength. They should not distribute too many dividends, which would be contrary to the government's purpose of maintaining industry and commerce. (7) Enterprises whose wartime losses do not exceed three-fifths of their capital can increase or decrease capital as they wish. (8) Property in the war zone that has not yet been lost should be listed as a 'War Zone Property' item. Wartime losses should only be included when there is a loss. The maintenance cost of this property should be included in the calculation of war zone property. (9) Enterprises that have suffered wartime losses and have already completed their final accounts for the 26th and 27th years can now reorganize and correct them based on the Ministry's approved method. (10) After processing according to the above supplementary measures, the original loss-making enterprises may instead report a profit, meaning that those whose losses exceed one-third of their capital or whose assets are obviously insufficient to pay off debts can therefore avoid the responsibility of directors and supervisors convening a shareholders' meeting and declaring bankruptcy. Furthermore, if the enterprise's wartime losses, after being processed according to the above measures, still exceed one-third of their capital or their assets are obviously insufficient to pay off debts, they should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law."

### Four Organizations Yesterday Farewell McDonald - McDonald Held Important Positions in the Municipal Council - Striving for Local Welfare - Chinese Ratepayers Association Sends Letter of Thanks

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Local Association held a farewell dinner at the International Hotel last night at 8 p.m. for McDonald, the Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council. More than 20 Chinese and Western guests attended. After Yu Qiaqing delivered a speech on behalf of the four organizations, McDonald gave a speech of thanks. Furthermore, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession also sent a special letter of thanks in accordance with the resolution of the Representative Assembly. The speeches and letter of thanks are recorded below:

Chairman's Speech: Mr. McDonald, gentlemen, a few years ago, a certain evening newspaper opened a column entitled "In the Eyes of the Chinese," the intention of which was to provide an opportunity for Chinese to express their views on current affairs and for foreigners to consult with them. As a result, the opinions expressed in the column, in addition to occasional disagreements between Chinese and foreign commentators, often echoed each other. This shows that the distance between the human observation capabilities is not very far. Tonight, I am honored to represent the four organizations in delivering a speech, trying to be among the ranks of that column. However, the discussion should be based on the topic of tonight. Tonight, we are gathered together to bid farewell to Mr. McDonald, who is taking leave to return home. Recently, there have been voices of praise for Mr. McDonald's morality and career among Westerners. However, "in the eyes of the Chinese," what kind of person is Mr. McDonald has not yet been heard. I can solemnly declare that in this matter, as in all other matters, the views held by the Chinese are no different from those held by the Westerners. Mr. McDonald is as respectable and admirable "in the eyes of the Chinese" as he is in the eyes of the Westerners. Mr. McDonald has been doing business in Shanghai for 19 years and enjoys a high reputation. At the same time, he has been working hard in social services, serving as Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council and chairing various committees for many years. His political achievements are very prominent. As a result, he has developed a very deep and lasting friendship with the people of Shanghai. In the speeches delivered by Mr. McDonald, we can see his deep concern and attachment to the local welfare and the happiness of the citizens of Shanghai. No wonder Mr. McDonald often feels that Shanghai is a place he cannot easily abandon. This is also something that the people of Shanghai are happy to maintain for a long time without weakening. Perhaps Mr. McDonald has not fully realized the depth of the Chinese people's admiration and friendship for him. What I can tell you is that Mr. McDonald's Chinese name, "Mai Ke Nuo Deng," is the most familiar name among Westerners in the city to the Chinese people. If we consider that Mr. McDonald's Chinese name has as many as four characters, and the pronunciation and transmission are extremely difficult, and if we add the title of "General" or "Mr.," it is even more difficult to imagine, then we will know that the Chinese people's knowledge of his name is not accidental. Mr. McDonald is gentle, courteous, and humorous, and he is also straightforward, saying everything he knows. His temperament is in harmony with that of upright Chinese gentlemen, so we can know that the Chinese people's feelings for him are deep and well-founded. The Chinese directors of the Municipal Council especially respect Mr. McDonald because he is courteous and gentle and can work together. All matters concerning the legitimate interests of the Chinese people can be expected to receive his assistance. Finally, I should solemnly thank Mr. McDonald for his enthusiasm for refugee relief work. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, Mr. McDonald, Mr. Xu Jiqing, and I have served as Chairman and Vice Chairman, working together for charitable and public welfare. Checking on and assisting refugees is a very serious problem after the war in Shanghai. Mr. McDonald has a deep understanding of this issue and has spared no effort to find a solution. Even if Mr. McDonald is only present at meetings and discussions, it is enough to make everyone feel admiration. His connection to the public is so great. I am very grateful for Mr. McDonald's enthusiasm for assisting and cooperating. I believe that all Chinese and Western colleagues present will also be grateful to the refugees. Gentlemen, Mr. McDonald's career achievements in Shanghai are a major contribution to promoting the current friendship between China and Britain. Please join me in raising a glass to Mr. McDonald!

Accordingly, the case is recorded and sent to you, and I express the gratitude of the ratepayers to your Excellency. I also hope that you will accept it with kindness." To Mr. McDonald.



### Profiteering Merchants Speculate: Selling Fake Permits; Main Culprit Awaits Arrest and Interrogation

Recently, anyone wishing to go to areas nominally "occupied" by the Japanese army must obtain a permit from the Japanese military. As a result, speculative businesses facilitating the acquisition of these permits have sprung up. These so-called "walking papers" are crudely made, yet sold at exorbitant prices. This has led unscrupulous individuals, blinded by greed, to widely counterfeit and fraudulently sell them. When discovered by the Japanese military, buyers not only lose money but also suffer other hardships. Consequently, authorities have repeatedly severely punished counterfeiters, but without completely eradicating them. The Hongkou police recently uncovered a fake permit operation at Room 107 of the Zhenhua Hotel on Fuzhou Road, where they sold permits deemed counterfeit by the Japanese military. Two local suspects, Zhu A‚Äôda and Wang Shi‚Äôde, were apprehended, and dozens of photos left by permit buyers were seized. However, the main culprit, Zhao Zi'an, remains at large. The following day, Zhu and Wang were transferred to the First Special District Local Court for detention, to continue the pursuit of the main culprit and a thorough investigation, before requesting prosecution and punishment. Judge Fang interrogated Zhu and Wang briefly and ordered them to be detained for further questioning next Tuesday.

### Chen Qiansheng Assassination Case: Concubine Released, Deemed Uninvolved

Chen Tingsheng, also known as Chen Sanzi, a native of Zhenjiang residing at No. 39, Haigeli, Haige Road, Xujiahui, was fatally attacked with pistols and knives at 6:00 AM on March 20th. The attack was orchestrated by his mistress, Wang Guizhen, in collusion with her lover, Tao Boqing, who funded the operation. The French police have successively apprehended the instigators Wang Guizhen and Tao Boqing, as well as the perpetrators of the murder, Na Aliu, Wang Liansheng, Cao Quanfa, Shen Jinfa, and a total of twelve individuals. They were transferred to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention, with a scheduled retrial on the 28th, as previously reported. It has now emerged that the French police also arrested Cao Aliu (19 years old, a local), a concubine of the deceased Chen Tingsheng, suspecting her involvement. She was detained along with the others. However, investigations have revealed that Cao is not involved in the case. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Cao was sent to the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Yao Qidi, a lawyer representing the French Concession's administrative authority, stated that the police investigation found no criminal activity on the part of the defendant and recommended her release. Judge Liao Tan approved the report and ordered Cao's release, stipulating that she should appear in court on the 28th for questioning.

### Landslide Occurs in Tangjiawan: Seven or Eight Houses Collapse; Reportedly All Unoccupied

Near the Xiaocaichang market in Tangjiawan, outside the Old West Gate, adjacent to Lanwei'ai Road, that is bordering the French Concession, several houses have been unoccupied since the focus of the war shifted inland.

### Opium Public Sales Bureau: Controls Opium in the Suburbs; 120 Opium Dealers in Shanghai; Intensified Policy of Intoxication

Since a certain power implemented a policy of intoxication in western Shanghai, opium dens have proliferated in the Caojiadu area, openly selling opium, spreading the addiction throughout Shanghai. Recently, this has intensified. The opium supply is now entirely controlled by a certain power, implementing public sales. The Public Sales Bureau is located in Hongkou, with four branch bureaus in Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and western Shanghai. Zheng Shixia, owner of the Shan Zheng Qia Ji Opium Firm, and Lan Basheng, owner of the Lan Yi Yu Opium Firm, serve as the Director and Deputy Director of the Bureau, respectively. Zheng Chuanying and Jiang Yumen serve as the Director and Deputy Director of the western Shanghai branch bureau. Zhong Xiaorong, Zhang Baohua, and Lin Rongchang are responsible for the Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong branch bureaus, respectively. Opium is transported by warships from the Rehe and North China areas. There are several types, including red soil and "North Soil" (i.e., Rehe soil). A total of 120 opium dealers, large, medium, and small, have been established in the suburbs, requiring business licenses. Large opium dealers must first pay a security deposit of 50,000 yuan, medium dealers 10,000 yuan, and small dealers 5,000 yuan. Zheng, Lan, and others advanced a total of 1.5 million yuan in security deposits, which has been paid to a certain power (reportedly the backer is Sheng Lao San from Changzhou). The establishment of public sales branch bureaus and opium dealer locations in each district has been finalized. The Nanshi branch will be located in the Nine Mu Land area, Zhabei in Tianbaoli, the Shanban Factory, and the northern end of the Xinqiao bridge; Pudong on Dongchang Road, and western Shanghai remains in Caojiadu. The opium sold by each dealer is supplied by a certain power through the Public Sales Bureau. It is clear that the spread of addiction in Shanghai is expanding.

### Wife Illicitly Dallies with Fake Police Chief; Husband Murders Wife, Then Commits Suicide; Both Die from Violent Cleaver Wounds to the Throat

Zhu Keting, 34 years old, from Baoshan, has worked at the Chen Yuan He rice shop in Caohejing town, western Shanghai, for over a decade. He married a woman surnamed Jin from his hometown, who is 24 years old and quite beautiful. After the fall of Baoshan, Zhu brought Jin to Shanghai to seek refuge, renting a house in the Wu family compound in Longhua town. Their marital relationship was generally harmonious. However, last year, Jin had an affair with a man surnamed Jia, the fake police chief of the town, and their clandestine relationship was not a one-time thing. Now, Zhu Keting has discovered the secret and found a fake police uniform in their room, leading him to contemplate murdering his wife. The night before last, while Jin was sound asleep, Zhu used a cleaver to violently slash her throat more than ten times, severing the throat bones and leaving a bloody mess. She died instantly. Seeing that Jin was dead, Zhu did not wish to live and committed suicide by slitting his own throat. By morning, neighbors discovered Zhu, still barely alive, but he soon died.

### Child Killed by Truck

Zhou Jiton, 38 years old, from Zhenjiang, a partner at the Hua Yu Hardware Store at No. 1, Lane 2, Jixiang Street in the French Concession, resides at No. 63, Ningshaoli, Jiangxi Road, in the British Concession. He has a son named Heshang, 9 years old, and a daughter named Xingzhu, 17 years old. Yesterday morning at 11:30 AM, Zhou's wife sent her two children, Heshang and Xingzhu, to Jixiang Street in the French Concession to buy incense and candles. They walked on Aiduya Road, the younger brother in front, the older sister behind, crossing the road. As they walked to No. 71 on the south side, a truck with license plate F2434, driven by a Russian driver named Shamoer (transliteration) from the Xuefolan Transportation Company, fully loaded with goods, was traveling from north to south on Jiangxi Road and turned west onto Aiduya Road. Zhou Heshang was unable to avoid the truck and was knocked down, suffering head injuries and bleeding from both ears. He collapsed on the ground. Chinese Constable No. 2866 of the British police arrived, recorded the license plate number, and sent the injured boy to Renji Hospital. He died before receiving treatment. The French police were notified and sent investigators. The body was transported to the Tongren Funeral Home for an autopsy, awaiting an examination by the Second Special Court today.

Bamboo Shoots Taxed According to Market Value; Customs Approval Granted; Tax Rate Per Stone Estimated at Fourteen Yuan

This year's climate is initially cold and then warm, so the supply of bamboo shoots has suddenly become brisk and prices have fallen. However, due to the environment, Zhejiang bamboo shoots imported into Shanghai must be subject to customs duties, but the authorities still calculate based on the initial selling price of 30 yuan per picul, meaning that bamboo shoot merchants not only make no profit after paying customs duties and transportation costs, but also suffer financial losses. Therefore, the Wukang Bamboo Shoot Industry Shanghai Office sent a letter to the local goods industry trade association of this city, requesting that it forward to the customs authorities the request to assess taxes according to the estimated selling price to alleviate the burden on bamboo shoot merchants. Yesterday, the local goods industry trade association prepared a letter recommending representative Yang Tiaogong, along with guest representative Qiu Leshan, to meet directly with the customs authorities to request that they assess taxes according to the market value to alleviate the difficulties of the guest side. This has now been approved, and in the future, taxes will be assessed at 14 yuan per picul, greatly benefiting bamboo shoot merchants, which is no small matter.

### Shanghai Special District Hygiene Testing Laboratory: Successful Experiment with Gonorrhea Preparation

The Shanghai Special District Hygiene Testing Laboratory has many years of experience in testing and examining gonorrhea sufferers. It has been discovered that a certain gonococcus in the patient's body, after being cultured and high-pressure sterilized to make a uniform solution, is effective in curing gonorrhea. Based on this principle, the laboratory carefully studied the process, and after hundreds of clinical experiments by doctors from major hospitals, and with improvements, it achieved the greatest success. After application of this gonorrhea preparation, there are no side effects such as constipation, indigestion, or other adverse reactions. Because the drug's efficacy lies in causing the blood to produce a large amount of antitoxin, which can exterminate gonococcus and dissolve toxins, it can thoroughly treat the disease and prevent recurrence. This is very different from the sandalwood oil preparations and diuretic antiseptic drugs generally available on the market. Currently, to meet the needs of the patients, the laboratory has specially provided the prescription to the Guanghua Pharmaceutical Factory to manufacture a product called "919" Gonorrhea Vaxing. It is sold in major pharmacies and companies in this city. Starting tomorrow, the Wing On Company's Western Medicine Department and the Jihuatang Pharmacy will offer a limited sale of 919 boxes at half price for three days. It is also reported that those who purchase and take this medicine can have a free examination at the Shanghai Special District Hygiene Testing Laboratory on Baiguan Road, so that patients can thoroughly understand their condition.

### Ranking of International Status

‚Äî Mao Lie

Everyone knows that countries have different rankings in the international community. Some are first-class countries, while others are second or third-class. The strength of military power is the standard for ranking, with the strong above and the weak below. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, China was roughly between second and third-class, while Japan considered itself in the first-class rank. Now, the facts tell us that this ranking has changed: Japan, as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "has been pressed down to the status of a second-class country by our War of Resistance," while we, as some foreign observers say, are on the path to becoming a first-class country.

This change is both contradictory and complementary. In other words, during the intense fighting of the past twenty-two months, their military power has weakened day by day, while our military power has strengthened day by day. Therefore, our rise in status has caused their decline in status. This is naturally not an empty theory, but is based on facts. They are like the melting snow under the scorching sun, dissolving piece by piece. The longer it lasts, the more it dissolves, irreversibly and irredeemably. We are like grains sown in the soil, sprouting, growing, flowering, and bearing fruit, capable of harvesting more grains. Furthermore, the melting of the snow not only does not harm the grains, but can also promote the grains' vitality. Therefore, their initial fierce momentum is helping our current prosperity.

Our rise in international status, in addition to comparing us to our enemies, can also be compared to other weak countries. Among the weaker countries, we were the first to be invaded, because it has been eight years since the Northeast Incident. During these eight years, Abyssinia was annexed first, and recently Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Albania were eliminated. Yet we still stand strong, resisting the aggressor with resistance, and we are fully confident that we can recover our lost territories in the near future. It is not necessary to discuss whether our military strength has increased. This alone is enough for us to be considered a first-class country without any shame.

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also said, "If we intensify our War of Resistance, we will certainly make their current second-class status untenable in the near future." Of course, on our side, after we "give them a fatal blow," our status as a first-class country will be undoubtedly secured.

Compatriots, we have suffered enough humiliation in the international community, especially in front of our enemies. Now we have stood up. From now on, we must stand firm, unyielding, and win the final victory, so that we can finally stand tall in the international community!

### When Alone

‚Äî By Gorky, Translated by Fan Xun

Last night, while crossing the Troitsky Bridge, I saw a young woman standing silently. This petite and slender woman hooked her arm, adorned with a brown glove, onto the bridge railing. I watched for a moment, thinking she was going to jump into the Neva River below. But she merely stuck out her nimble tongue, mockingly at the moon in the sky.

The moon, like a cunning old fox, slipped away lightly among the smoky, hazy clouds. It appeared red and large, like the drunken face of a drunkard. Perhaps this woman had suffered because of it. Her action was retaliatory. At least in my eyes, her gesture towards the moon was very cold.

After seeing this interesting event, I thought of other similar little things, causing me to burst into laughter in my memories. As I see it, when a person is alone‚Äîat least when they think there's no one else around‚Äîtheir actions are like those of a mentally ill madman, and I can't think of any other word to describe these people making strange gestures.

The first time I saw someone making abnormal movements while alone was in my childhood. After a circus performance, I saw the British clown Langdale, having finished his performance, pacing along a deserted corridor. When he passed a large mirror, he suddenly took off his top hat and bowed respectfully to his own reflection. There was indeed no third person there, but I was sitting in a gutter right above him. He couldn't see me, but I could see his legs very clearly. When he bowed to himself, I even poked my head out to look at him. That day I pondered silently, confused and unable to explain it. But now I think that Langdale was just a fool, someone whose profession was to make strange gestures, and at most just an Englishman.

Many years later, I went to visit Anton Chekhov; I was told he was in the garden. As I walked through the garden gate, I saw him sitting there alone. He was trying to catch the sunlight with his hat to put it on his head, but of course, his foolish idea was not going to succeed. I could see how frustrated he was by the repeated failures; his face turned redder and redder. He quickly slapped his hat against his knee and then hurriedly put it back on his head. Finally, abandoning this impossible game, he kicked the little dog beside him away, half-closed his eyes, and glanced at the sky one last time before tiptoeing back to his house. He saw me at the door, and he smiled and said to me, "Have you read Balmont's rhyming poems? Oh! The sun smiles at the grass! What a silly fellow, isn't it? In Russia, it laughs at the soap bubbles of Katya (the washerwoman); here, it laughs at the sweat of the grass."

On another occasion, I spied on him trying to stuff a thick red pencil into a narrow-necked medicine bottle. Of course, this was a fruitless act. He probably knew he was conducting a grand experiment of breaking a law of physics, and he was doing this ridiculous trick with the scholar‚Äôs perseverance and patience.

Leo Tolstoy spoke softly to a lizard, "Well! Are you happy?" The little animal was lying on a stone in the bushes, sunbathing. Tolstoy stood quietly in front of it, in his usual manner, with his hands in the pockets of his wide coat. Finally, the great writer looked around cautiously, then sighed and said resolutely: "If I were like you, I wouldn't be happy."

The great chemist Tikhvinsky was sitting in his dining room, holding a shallow teacup that reflected his face. He shouted loudly at the teacup: "Hey! Old fellow! What are you doing alone?" But the reflection coldly ignored him. Tikhvinsky sighed deeply, his face gradually darkening. He frowned at his own image, twitching his nose, looking like the wrinkled forehead and long nose of an old elephant.

The famous novelist Leskov sat alone at the table, tearing cotton into small pieces and throwing them into a bowl one after another. Each time the small, soft cotton touched the bottom of the bowl, he pricked up his ears to hear if the cotton would make a sound when it landed in the bowl.

Volodysky placed a shoe in front of him and sternly ordered it to walk by itself. "I know you won't walk," he said with a proud look. "You see! Without me, you can't get to where you want to go."

"What are you doing, Dad!" I burst in unexpectedly. He looked at me, and said dismissively, "You're asking about the shoe! This shoe is so small that it only fits my heel. They always make such ill-fitting shoes these days."

Women often talk to themselves when they are alone, decorating or playing. Once, I saw a beautiful and well-educated woman sitting alone in an armchair by the window, eating candy. Every time she picked up her favorite food with delicate candy tongs, she murmured, "Now I'm going to eat you!" After she finished eating, she would say to herself, "Am I the one who ate you?"

In the lounge of a certain theater, there was only one late, dark-haired young woman. She stopped in front of every mirror. Suddenly, I heard her say, "But‚Äîeveryone has to die."

There was no one else there besides her and me. I was also too late to enter the theater. But I was really too late, so late that I missed the first half of the strange drama she was performing. The room was dark, and she never thought there was anyone else in the room besides her. I think if she had seen me, she would never have asked a stranger such an unusual question. I don't think she would have known to discuss such profound philosophy with me.

### Coming and Unable to Leave

### "Love" and "Hate"

‚Äî Wallflower

How shall I express the pent-up loneliness? Urgently, I need to hear the sincere voices of humanity. I would be encouraged, invigorated! My life would be adorned with brilliance!

Hailing, shouting, bring only empty echoes. Lead-like, my heart is heavy‚Äî.

Disappointment, hesitation? I will not. I will use my life force until the final disintegration before I rest, pursuing the great ravine where human emotions intermingle!

We are endowed with "love" and "hate." Loving what I should love, hating what I should hate, isn't that the most genuine humanity?

Bustling for profit, rushing for fame, confined to a small world, a narrow-minded life has nothing but pity.

Poverty, filth, cunning, deceit, the bricks and stones that build the walls between people, strive to accelerate their collapse!

One who strongly loves life naturally has strong desires for "love" and "hate"! "Love" and "hate" originating from human nature are one and the same, without high or low, good or bad.

Expand our "love" and "hate"! As bland as water? No, as rich as wine!

Going without trace,

Miraculous exploits are built from the shadows.

Regardless of wind, frost, rain, or snow,

Annihilate the enemy,

Regardless of day or night, sun or shade,

Never for a moment will we relax!

Attack the unreal by appearing to attack the real,

Our ingenious plans are manifold,

Unpredictable and infinitely wonderful.

Fight guerrilla warfare,

Come and join:

Unfold this war to rescue us from the crisis of peril!

### Afterthoughts

‚Äî Editor

I often see terms like "wisdom" or "intellectual class." I think the "wisdom" here should be "knowledge." "Wisdom" is "intelligence," which is very different from "knowledge," and what is usually used is actually "knowledge" rather than "wisdom," so "wisdom" should not be used.

Some submitted manuscripts seem to have words that are too small, making them difficult to read; and some have lines that are too tight, making it impossible to make any changes. Please, contributors, be considerate and improve.

### The Literary Lineage of "Glamour" and "Charm"

‚Äî Wu Ling

We have always looked down on women, but sometimes we have particularly looked up to women.

In history, whenever there was a period of "unrest," everyone wanted women to win honor for the country. The way to win honor was to "die." "When bandits came, the head of the household fled, and the women died, died, died. When foreign tribes invaded, civil officials advocated peace, military generals surrendered, and the women died, died, died."

What happened after death? Then our men of letters jumped out: elegies, dirges, you rhymed, I rhymed; even secretly composing one or copying one from somewhere, forcibly placing it on the head of the deceased, saying it was a martyr's death poem, and then composing another one, you rhymed, I rhymed again. And this was called "romantic anecdotes" and "charming affairs," still for the sake of winning honor.

In history, the "bandits" have really helped us create a lot of "romantic anecdotes" and "charming affairs." But the so-called "bandits" were the "roaming bandits" that our modern great men speak of, who were all forced out by emperors and officials. If there were no emperors and officials, there would be no "romantic anecdotes" and "charming affairs." Therefore, our men of letters have always supported emperors and officials. Foreign invasions have helped our "romantic anecdotes" and "charming affairs" even more, like the Jin, Yuan, and Manchu people. These achievements are easy for us to investigate. These foreign tribes directly created "romantic anecdotes" and "charming affairs." On the one hand, they all became emperors and officials in the end, so our men of letters simply supported them in the end, regardless of whether they were foreign tribes or not. The evidence is those circulating elegies, dirges, and harmonizing and rhyming poems, which never scolded emperors and officials, nor did they scold the foreign plunder, but only desperately worked on "glamour" and "charm." Naturally, this is "art for art's sake." But in the end, they revealed their "tails": the honor they were fighting for was not really the honor of the country, but only the honor of a few men who were alive and well.

But what if a few women simply refuse to die? Wouldn't that be too lonely for the men of letters? But it doesn't matter. The men of letters have many ideas. Now they are scolding the woman on the one hand and praising the woman on the other. They scold her for having no shame, and praise her for having a beautiful face. So it is still "romantic anecdotes" and "charming affairs," and this time the "glamour" and "charm" are even more "glamorous" and "charming." As a result, this time the honor completely belongs to the men of letters.

What I have said above are naturally all past situations. As for modern times, there is a slight change. Women are no longer so enthusiastic about dying, and although honor is still needed, they have to find other ways. However, our men of letters seem to still hold on to their past ideas and are still pursuing "glamour" and "charm." However, because it is, after all, modern times, the methods of pursuit have also changed, and they no longer nakedly display the signboard of "glamour" and "charm." What they have are even bigger topics.

A few years ago, the men of letters living in Beijing were very enthusiastic about visiting Sai Jinhua, praising Sai Jinhua, arranging conversations with Sai Jinhua, and inviting Sai Jinhua to dinner. As a result, books came out one after another. It was said that they were trying to find out many anecdotes from the end of the late Qing Dynasty from her mouth, but they immediately said that her knowledge was too poor and she couldn't find them out at all, which was really disappointing. However, even though they were disappointed, the books still had to be published. So there were no anecdotes in the book, but it praised the Qing Empress Dowager, read through the German Marshal, and scolded the "Boxer rebels," to set off a "glamour" and "charm" to complete the matter.

When Shanghai was at war, a bomb fell in front of the "Great World," and I don't know how many poor people, workers, and small businessmen died. But a writer came from elsewhere, passed through this place, and wrote a poem saying that he seemed to see that there were still broken, dyed red fingernails of fashionable women left there, but he didn't see anything else. This is really "glamorous" and "charming." However, this poem was published, and it is said to be a kind of "national salvation literature."

This time, they are going to create historical works about the end of the Ming Dynasty. So a man of letters came out to speak: historical themes must be selected. Naturally, this is correct. But after selecting and selecting, they only selected Chen Yuanyuan, saying that she was more meaningful than the righteous people who resisted the war in Jiangyin and other places at the end of the Ming Dynasty. Naturally, Chen Yuanyuan's background is complicated, but how is she more meaningful than the righteous people who resisted the war? This seems very incomprehensible at first, but as long as you know the ideas in the bones of our men of letters, you will immediately understand. Chen Yuanyuan can be both "glamorous" and "charming." In this respect, those righteous people can only "feel ashamed of their inferiority."

Pursuing "glamour" and "charm" is our "literary lineage." Without this "literary lineage," our men of letters may not have "inspiration."

### Random Talk About Theater in a Crooked House: Actors Changing Careers (Part 2)

‚Äî A Person Who Sings Both Northern and Southern Tunes

Liu Xiaoheng initially sang old male roles, imitating Chang Liheng's plays. His neighbor initiated his education, later he played young female roles, becoming famous for "The Substitute Prince."

Furong Cao changed from young female roles to old male roles, but he didn't become popular. So he changed back to young female roles, wholeheartedly dedicating himself to young female roles, which is why he enjoys today's great reputation.

Zhou Xinfang sang male beard roles when his voice was fine. After his voice deteriorated, he specialized in acting skills, but had a great addiction to painted face young male roles, often making guest appearances. He also had a great addiction to singing plays. "Visiting Mother and Returning to the Order" was still performed. He is now the leader of the acting old male role performers in Jiangnan.

Yang Jusheng is the younger brother of Xiao Yang Yuelou. At first, the two brothers studied male beard roles together, and later they both changed to young female roles. Xiao Yang Yuelou became popular, but Jusheng did not. In order to accompany Xiao Yang Yuelou in plays, he changed back to old male roles.

Guan Dayuan originally sang male beard roles, and was greatly praised by Jia Honglin and Liu Jingran. Later he changed to martial male roles, studying under Yang Xiaolou. Because he gained weight, he returned to singing old male roles.

Yang Ruiting came from Qinqiang Bangzi opera. He changed to Jingban opera, first singing old male roles, then changing to martial male roles, also performing painted face martial roles. Later, he specialized in old male roles and old female roles, and also sang red male roles. Recently, through the introduction of Xu Heizhen, he studied Kunqu opera with Master Hongdou.

Gai Jiaotian, when he first appeared on stage, belonged to the Yuxian Troupe, using the name Gai Zhaotan Jiaotian as a selling point, singing male beard roles. After his voice deteriorated, he changed to martial male roles.

Zhang Guobin, originally a singing old male role performer, is the son of the martial female role performer Sai Zhenfeng (i.e., Zhang Yingpu, Gai Jiaotian's younger brother). After his voice deteriorated, he changed to martial male roles, co-starring with his younger brother Zhang Zhibin in the Shen Tingling play. It was a popular play at the Yiwu Stage in those years. Later, he changed to acting old male roles, becoming famous in Liyuan with the Burning Cotton play. He is now affiliated with the Grand Stage.

Jiang Miaoxiang initially sang green shirt roles (Baida Company initially recorded records, which can serve as proof), and also played young female roles. He learned a lot of green shirt plays from Chen Shitou (Delin). Later, he changed to young male roles due to hemoptysis. His daughter married Tan Fuying as a second wife.

Zhang Delu, the son of the martial male role performer Zhang Shunlai, appeared on stage as a child actor, specializing in male beard role plays such as "Li Ling Tablet." After his voice deteriorated, he first changed to painted face martial roles, then changed to martial male roles. He still performs martial male roles to this day. He has a wide abdomen and can write new plays.

Lin Pinqing initially studied martial clown roles, studying under Xu Danling (whether these three characters are correct is to be verified). Because he did not master martial skills, he changed to old male roles, appearing on stage under the name Lin Xiaofen. After his voice deteriorated, he changed to young female roles. Recently, due to old age, he teaches students to entertain himself in his later years. His son, Youxiang, can inherit his mantle and is very famous in the Hangjiahu area.

Pan Haiqiu is the legitimate son of the deceased famous actor Pan Yueqiao (Pan Dingxin, currently affiliated with the Gong Stage, is Yueqiao's illegitimate son). He initially sang male beard roles, named Xiao Liqing. After his voice deteriorated, he changed to young female roles, affiliated with the Xintai Stage in Nine Mu Land for a long time. Currently, he is addicted to smoking and works as a backstage director for Zhang Zhi'er's Huaicao Troupe, earning less than ten yuan a month, which is very tragic.

Wu Fengchun, the son of Wu Yuehua, was a child actor singing male beard roles at the San Malu Civilization Grand Stage in the early years. After his voice deteriorated, he changed to green shirt roles, then changed to young female roles, and later changed to young male roles. He is now known for teaching opera. Most of the rising Kun female roles in Shanghai have come from his tutelage. He was named Wu Zhuchen during the era of singing male beard roles.

In short, actors changing careers is not because of following trends, but because of their voices or their physique. The above is just a rough summary. Those who change careers due to special circumstances are not recorded.

### Zhu Qiuhen Joins Green Treasure: Monthly Salary of 200 Yuan. Today's Performance: Karmic Love and Grievances

‚Äî Ke Wei

After the war, many movie actresses fell into the circle of civilized drama "for the sake of life." We can count Xia Peizhen (now in Beiping), Fan Xuepeng (in Green Treasure), and Ye Qiuxin (in Tianyunlou). There was a rumor for a time that "Dark Circles" Tan Ying would also go to sea, but it did not materialize because the conditions were not negotiated.

Starting today, Green Treasure has another movie star going to sea. Perhaps everyone will not forget this person when mentioned, that is, Zhu Qiuhen, the Beiping girl who was rumored to have married once.

We briefly know about Zhu Qiuhen's life. She used to perform old plays in Beiping. After arriving in Shanghai, she joined the Mingxing Company. Before the war, because she went out to shoot on location, some people rumored that she had a small love affair with someone, which made her and the Mingxing Company not very happy. Later, it was rumored that she would marry a college student, and the two would go to Beiping together. She herself also gave up her screen life and prepared to enter school. Unexpectedly, her dream did not come true in the end. Following that, she "for the sake of life" joined "Green Treasure" like other actresses.

Zhu Qiuhen's joining Green Treasure this time was introduced by Mr. Zhou Bangjun, a shareholder of Green Treasure. She joined Green Treasure with the title of a movie star, so her salary is much higher than the salary of movie stars in general film companies. It is said to be 200 yuan per month. (Several important roles in Green Treasure have salaries of almost 100 to 200 yuan.)

Starting today, Zhu Qiuhen will appear in the Green Treasure Theater in a brand new film and television posture. The play she is performing is called "Karmic Love and Grievances." From then on, there will be one more movie star in the civilized drama world.

Finally, what makes people feel is that, although the "Green Treasure" performance standard is higher than that of other civilized drama theaters, the few movie stars who have gone to sea to perform civilized dramas are certainly not going to sea again "for the sake of improving civilized drama." The main reason they go to sea is just "for the sake of life," alas!

### Gu Menghu's Unjust Imprisonment

Imprisoned for a full sixteen hours, released on the afternoon of the day before yesterday.

When Gu Menghu joined the Queen's Theater to perform civilized drama, it was also when the debate on "improving civilized drama" was the most intense. Later, he joined Green Treasure, and in addition to performing on stage himself, he also served as a screenwriter and director. We believe that in the movement to "improve civilized drama," Gu Menghu was still relatively level-headed.

The day before yesterday, Gu Menghu was contacting a friend about the script, and around twelve o'clock at night, he passed through Fuxu Road and Chengdu Road. That night, the French Concession was inspecting pedestrians particularly strictly. During the interrogation, Gu Menghu somehow clashed with them. At that time, a thing that the patrolman did not recognize was found on Gu Menghu's body, so it seemed that there was even more reason to take Gu Menghu to the patrol room.

Did Gu Menghu really have anything suspicious? Of course not, but that "strange paper" that the patrolman did not recognize was a bit strenuous, so Gu Menghu was detained in the patrol room the first night, which corresponded to the old routine of the old novel called "nothing to say for a night," but Gu Menghu's night was really not easy.

By the next day, that "strange paper" was immediately translated by someone. It turned out to be an ordinary "song score." It was not until four o'clock in the afternoon that he was released. The foreigner in the patrol room also apologized to him before leaving.

During the sixteen hours of being innocently imprisoned like that, he didn't get anything to eat. The first thing that made him uncomfortable was his stomach, which was not forgiving, and was really about to starve through. Wind and Rain

### After Viewing the Chinese Dynastic Paintings and Calligraphy Exhibition

‚Äî Chen Dieye

Pang Xuqi's collections are as vast as the sea, the wealthiest in the country. What is on display here are not even his most prized pieces, yet Wu Zhonggui's "Cold Geese by Lugou Bridge" still possesses the subtle charm of a corner of a hermit's painting. Liu Wan'an's "Summer Clouds Threatening Rain" truly crowns this exhibition. The Wang and Xie families consider seven-foot corals as mere potted plants; for others, exhibiting such pieces would nearly exhaust their collections.

Wu Hufan's contribution is best represented by a collaborative scroll by Dong Qichang and Wu Xuanshui. Xuanzai (Dong Qichang) highly praised Xuanshui in this painting. However, in my view, Xuanzai's brushwork constitutes eight or nine tenths of the work, almost directly emulating the Yuan masters. I have always respected Dong, and this scroll, along with the large pieces in the Qing Palace collection, is also a Dong imperial work. A plum blossom painting by Song Dynasty painter Tang Zhengzhong and a landscape by Ming Dynasty painter Zhou Chen, one being part of Hufan's wife's dowry and the other a hand-picked treasure of Duke Keqi, demonstrate a respect for ancestral legacies. Hufan's gesture is commendable. However, the "Zhong KuiË°•Ë¢ûÂúñ" (Zhong Kui Supplementing the Emperor's Robe) labeled as a painting from the Five Dynasties is regrettable. Only the "Yunji Qiqian" (Seven Tablets in a Cloudy Satchel) contains the story of Zhong Kui marrying a "mo." The "Qidong Yeyu" (Anecdotes from Qi East) changes "mo" to "mei," mistranslating it as "younger sister." Later, the story of Zhong Jinshi marrying off his younger sister appeared in Zaju plays. People from the Five Dynasties would not have known this story. Among the Tang and Song paintings in this exhibition, I only lament that the Tang Zhengzhong plum blossom and Zhou Fang's "Playing Children" are there. If we are adhering to the principle of selecting the best, the rest can be excluded. What does Daya think?

Zhang Congyu collected paintings with the goal of ensuring the paper was white and the board new, so his collection is mostly exquisite. Zhou Fang's scroll is a masterpiece. I read in Song Dynasty notes that Tang Dynasty painters Wu Daozi and Zhou Fang depicted women with knitted brows and dark lips, portraying a sorrowful appearance. Su Laoquan also mentioned this. The "Wuxing Zhi" (Treatise on the Five Elements) considered it a sign of moral decay, as it reflected the fashion of women at the time. Today, Wu's paintings are no longer to be seen, and Zhou's depictions of women are no longer like that. Tang Yin, who best learned from Zhou Fang, also didn't paint like that. Could it be that what the Song people saw was accidental? The "Sima Zhongcai Hua and Su Xiaomei" painting by Yuan Dynasty painter Liu Yuan was once in my collection. Congyu loved it and yielded it to me. Many viewers do not know who Liu Yuan was. According to research, Wu, is Liu Lan, a talented sculptor from Yunnan. It is said that the Luohan statues in the Qiongzhu Temple in Yunnan were created by him. Later, Liu Guan wrote a colophon, along with Huang Zijiu's inscription. The seal was that of "Iron Flute Daoist." Congyu considered it a forgery and returned it to me after cutting it off, also a secret in the art world. Among Congyu's contributions, I most like Hua Xinluo's "Red Lotus and Kingfisher," which seems to converse happily with the egrets and reeds, exuding a natural and lively charm. Other works, such as Mo Yunqing's refined elegance and Jianjiang's cold detachment, along with Wang Chong's plumpness exhibited by Hufan, are all rare treasures, forming a triumvirate. Wang Zhenpeng's "Begging Bowl" is the crown jewel of Zhang's collection.

Ding Huikang initially didn't collect extensively, but recently he has become a vigorous collector. This exhibition was initiated by him and includes Bada Shanren's orchids and geese, as well as Zou Fanglu's Mountain Dwelling, all of which are masterpieces. Although the Eight Masters of Jinling are not great masters, Zou Zhe, Xie Sun, and Hu Zao are rare works. This exhibition includes Zou's Mountain Dwelling and Hu Shigong's Dense Forest, collected by Zhao Youqing, which are also treasures. Huikang has a painting by Liu Wan'an, very similar to Dong Xiangguang, but bolder and fiercer. Some considered it doubtful, so Huikang removed it from display, showing his willingness to accept good advice. However, in my opinion, Xiangguang's style originated from Yingqiu Juran, and Wan'an's craftsmanship is equally skillful. Changing the brushwork is acceptable. The painting has a colophon by Yang Xunji, proving its authenticity. To discard it is like carving a mark on a boat to find a lost sword. I wish to discuss this with Daya.

### Securities: US's New Moves on the Pacific Coast Boost Domestic Bonds; Foreign Stocks Also See Progress

In the securities and foreign exchange market, the trend was up and down yesterday. The morning saw a strong decline, with E-class falling below the two-yuan mark. The intention of the upper echelon seemed uncertain, causing many retail investors to follow suit and sell. In the afternoon, a surge suddenly occurred, with rumors spreading of a special telegram from President Roosevelt to Japan, advocating respect for the interests of third countries and US intervention, raising hopes for peace. Short sellers began to cover their positions, and major bullish players seized the opportunity to raise prices. However, since the current grey market operates on a cash transaction basis, there is no limit of four yuan for price increases. The surge of six yuan in A-class on January 10th serves as a lesson for short sellers. Yesterday, De Fu No. 5 took the lead in selling, suppressing market prices, while simultaneously buying back in. As a result, Tong Shun, Qia Feng, and No. 18, seeing the unfavorable situation, also unloaded their positions. E-class once fell below the two-yuan mark, with No. 40, Shui Feng, and Da Tong showing some appetite for buying. At the close, No. 38 and Le Mao bought A and B-class aggressively, causing a slight recovery. In the morning, the results were small, but in the afternoon, new news emerged, stimulating short sellers to actively cover their positions, resulting in an immediate jump of three to four cents. A-class broke through the two-yuan mark, and C-class also reached three yuan. Da Feng first advanced and then retreated, De Fu bought more than it sold, Run Li absorbed consistently, and both Tong Kang and Mao Tai had needs. The market sentiment was firm and rising, gradually showing signs of taking off. In the end, the market price rose by two to six cents, with a total transaction volume of approximately 1.5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

For stock trading, cloth transactions were 50 shares at a price of 39.75 yuan, higher than before by more than half a yuan. The stock market and morale in the general public association saw some progress, with more buyers appearing. Public utility stocks (such as trams and buses), Jardine Matheson, and Yeguangshe all had good demand. The British company Zha Hua Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by Jardine Matheson & Co., decided at yesterday's board meeting to pay a final dividend of 75 cents per share for 1938. Combined with the interim dividend of 25 cents per share, the total dividend paid was one yuan. This dividend is scheduled to be paid after being announced at the shareholders' meeting on May 4th, which has greatly satisfied the public. Therefore, interest in other rubber stocks has also slightly increased, although most buyers are offering low prices. Jardine Matheson shares are stable with no change. Although the political situation is still uncertain, there is a feeling that the situation in the Far East has reached its worst point and that mediation may be possible in the near future. Even those with a pessimistic outlook may harbor this hope.

In addition, Zha Hua Kang Sha Lai Te Rubber Coffee Co., Ltd., also managed by Jardine Matheson & Co., decided at yesterday's board meeting to pay a dividend of 5 cents per share for 1938. This dividend is scheduled to be paid soon after being announced at the shareholders' meeting to be held on May 4th.

On the 18th of this month (Tuesday), the listed prices of London-based British Far East companies showed limited fluctuations. The Mercantile Bank shares slightly contracted by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with a price of ¬£7 12s 6d. The Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corporation's Hong Kong-registered shares rose by half a pound, with a price of ¬£82.5. The Kailuan Mining shares rose by 6 pence, with a price of 17 shillings. There were no other changes.

The Shanghai Sassoon Building-based US China Securities Company previously decided at a board meeting to pay an interim dividend of 4 cents per share on common stock, which began on the 15th of this month.

On the 18th of this month (Wednesday), the listed prices of London-based Chinese foreign debt showed little gain or loss, but the foundation remained weak. British and German continued borrowing. British issued bonds have gradually fallen from a high price of ¬£78 on the 8th of last month, falling by a significant ¬£14 up to the day before yesterday. Yesterday's trading saw a rebound of half a pound, with a price of ¬£64.5. The Crisp loan fell by half a pound, with a price of ¬£36.5. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway bonds also fell by 5 shillings, with a price

### Finance: Wealthy Individuals Divest; Cash Prices Reverse Downward; Hong Kong Banks' Purchases Limited

Yesterday's cash gold grey market was extremely quiet, lacking any highlights. However, the underlying trend suddenly turned downward, mainly because wealthy individuals in the city have shown little interest in hoarding gold. Furthermore, given yesterday's reports that Germany and Italy have taken a cold attitude towards President Roosevelt's peace proposals, their intentions to divest have become more pronounced. A certain money exchange and cash firm successively sold on behalf of wealthy individuals. Although a certain jewelry store continued to absorb on behalf of Hong Kong banks, the amount was limited, and other banks remained cautiously observing. As a result, supply was greater than demand in the scarce transactions, causing prices to fall. In the end, prices fell by five yuan, and transactions were also quite scarce, only 200 taels. Jewelry gold remained at the original price, and customs gold remained stable. Chinese and English pure gold prices moved downward again.

From the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially opened with a downward trend due to the strong intention of wealthy individuals to divest and the Hong Kong banks' weak absorption. At around 10 AM, a certain money exchange first sold 30 taels to a certain jewelry store at 2,077.5 yuan, an opening price 2.5 yuan lower than the previous closing. After the opening, the cash firm also followed suit and sold a total of 70 taels to a certain jewelry store, all at a price of 77 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange sold another 50 taels to a certain jewelry store at a price of 76 yuan. Afterwards, various parties still wanted to divest, but the certain jewelry store had stopped absorbing, and there was no other demand, making it difficult to trade. By noon, the selling price was still 76 yuan. In the afternoon, the situation remained weak due to the lack of buyers, resulting in few transactions. A certain money exchange sold to a certain money exchange, still calling for a selling price of 75 yuan, but buyers only offered a price of 73 yuan to absorb. The market remained unchanged until the evening close, so the evening closing was still 2,075 yuan, a drop of five yuan from the previous night's closing. The cash firm's selling price for its own brand of gold was 2,080 yuan, and the buying price was 2,070 yuan. The current gold standard was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were no transactions.

Jewelry Gold Remains at Original Price

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael has remained at its original price because the fluctuations in cash gold have not been significant. Da Tong Bank's price is 211 yuan, Xin Tong Hang's price is 209 yuan, and the buying price is 203 yuan.

Pure Gold Drops by Half a Penny

According to an 18th London telegram, English pure gold fell by half a penny per ounce, reaching ¬£7 8s 6d. As a result, the central bank's purchase price for Chinese cash also fell to 1,212.3 yuan. The listed price of customs gold remained flat, at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also contracted by 3 jiao, reaching 1,207.6 yuan.

### Japanese Banks Aggressively Settle Forward US Dollars

Although the foreign exchange market was still busy with settlement by major foreign banks yesterday, and Texaco also started absorbing, foreign banks such as HSBC continued to supply as much as possible. As a result, the underlying trend was extremely flat, and there were no changes. However, the June US dollar, due to aggressive settlement by Japanese banks and the unwillingness of Tianjin banks to sell cheaply, showed a slightly softened state. Transactions were lively throughout the day. As for the Hong Kong dollar, the situation became more stable due to the scarcity of supply and demand on both sides.

In the early morning, the London large bills showed a recent price of long 0.0625, and a forward premium of 0.0125. The US silver remained stable. London gold fell by half a penny. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was flat, the same as the exchange rate with Shanghai, and small for the French franc. The US dollar fell by 0.0625 against the British pound, but remained flat against Shanghai and unchanged against the French franc. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with a selling price of 8 and 25 cents for the British pound and 16.0625 yuan for the US dollar, with no changes from the previous closing. After the opening, Japanese banks first mutually traded July British pounds at 8 and 234375 cents. Subsequently, Japanese banks aggressively settled foreign bank's beneficial (on behalf of Tianjin banks) June US dollars at 16 yuan, which showed a slightly softened state. HSBC's listed prices were unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was announced at 2.5%, a levy of 5.25%. Afterwards, although foreign banks came to settle, foreign banks were still willing to supply, so the situation was quite stable. Foreign banks purchased HSBC's and Mercantile Bank's British pounds at 8 and 25 cents, and the oil company Texaco also settled US dollars with a certain bank at 16.0625 yuan. Later, Chinese banks mutually traded British pounds at 8 and 25 cents. As noon approached, transactions became clearer. However, the Hong Kong dollar slightly improved, with foreign bank Anda selling Hong Kong dollars to a foreign bank at 56 yuan. The situation was also flat. At the close, banks were selling British pounds at 8 and 25 cents, US dollars at 16.0625 yuan, and Hong Kong dollars at 56 yuan. As a result, there were no gains or losses for the British, American, and Hong Kong dollar compared to the previous night's closing. There was no market in the afternoon.

### US Dollar Notes are Cheaper than Drafts; Many Collect Them

Yesterday, English pure gold fell by half a penny, and British and American exchange rates fell by 0.0625. Foreign exchange banks in the city were settling large amounts, and Japanese banks also had strong needs. Fortunately, the supply from foreign banks was smooth, and market prices remained stable as before. The spot gold market opened slightly soft, with gold shops and money exchanges having mutual supply and demand. The situation was swirling and slightly soft, and transactions were stagnant. The afternoon market was still sluggish, with weak customer buying interest. The closing trend was soft. Foreign currencies, such as British and American gold pounds, had relatively scarce supply and demand, and the changes were quite small. The need for British gold notes was not strong, but the trading of US dollar notes was quite active. Customers had a very smooth absorption and were numerous, likely collectors, because the market price was cheaper than drafts. The supply and demand for Hong Kong notes was still strong, and the price was stable. The need for Korean notes was very scarce, and the market value was increasingly cheap, only worth 8 jiao and 5 fen. There were not many association transactions, but the transaction amount was large. Chang Tai sold to Hong Chang ten British gold pounds, and Jin Da bought from it 3,500 yuan in US dollar notes. Xiang Kang sold to Cheng Tai 100 yuan in US dollar drafts, and Tong Feng sold to Cheng Tai 500 yuan in US dollar notes. Yesterday's market price showed a decrease of 5 fen for British gold pounds, an increase of 1 and 3 cents for British gold notes, an increase of 1 and 3 cents for US dollar notes, a decrease of 2 hao and 5 li for French franc notes, and a decrease of 5 fen for German gold notes. Other currencies were unchanged.

### North China Legal Tender's Credit Rises Daily; Tianjin "Counterfeit Money" Falls Again

Tianjin, 19th Telegram: The grey market price of counterfeit "United Reserve Bank Notes", compared with the morning opening on the 18th, continued to fall sharply by 7.5 yuan, with a price of 123.5 yuan (the price of 100 yuan of legal tender, that is, one yuan of "United Reserve Bank Notes" is only worth 8 jiao, 9 li, and 7 hao of legal tender).

### Grains: Flour Market Factory Prices Stabilize; Foreign Flour Prices Still Increasing; Japanese Merchants Continue to Handle Local Wheat

Factory Flour: Yesterday's factory flour market continued to be stable. Second-grade flour merchants all temporarily held to the original price of 4.45 yuan, but merchant transactions gradually became sluggish. It is understood that since the Qingming Festival holiday, North China merchants have shipped out 302,500 bags of flour. It is also heard that new foreign flour has arrived there, so new transactions have been less enthusiastic. South China merchants have also shipped 73,400 bags of flour in the past two weeks, so they lack the intention to add to bulk transactions, only engaging in sporadic spot transactions. The total daily transactions amounted to more than 30,000 bags. It is also heard that there is a difference of 5 fen for the "Pao Che Pai" (Cannon Cart Brand) flour sold by North China merchants, and that the prices of various brands of returned goods on the market have also decreased by 2.5 to 5 fen, and the market prospects may change. It is found that yesterday's flour exports amounted to 20,000 bags, shipped to Quanzhou. Today's (20th) exports include 32,500 bags shipped to Tianjin, and 13,300 bags shipped to Shantou. Yesterday, 20,000 bags of bran were shipped to Quanzhou.

Foreign Flour: Yesterday's foreign flour market was particularly outstanding. According to overseas telegrams, recent rainfall has been low, reducing supply. Exports of American wheat have reached 10,963,000 bushels. In addition, the European situation is also causing the market to rebound, so the prices of foreign flour and wheat are consistently increasing. Forward orders have all become quiet. The supply of foreign flour on the market is also relatively scarce, because hoarders intend to sell at good prices, and merchants have not yet shipped out all the previous goods, so they lack the intention to add to the volume. Only local spot transactions, with transactions less than 10,000 bags. The "Lun Chuan Pai" (Steamer Brand) price requires 4.45 yuan per remittance. "Hong Ri Dang Tian Lao Pai" (Red Sun Same Day Old Brand) and "Hua Niao Bian Fu" (Flower Bird Bat) and other brands are feeling the lack of supply, so sellers are still increasing prices.

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market saw only a few transactions. From the Yangtze River, 677 bags were newly transported from Xingang, and sporadic deliveries of Beijing-Zhenjiang wheat amounted to about 1,000 bags. Factory demand was flat, and merchants were not active. All intended to select high-quality goods, so the market showed no special signs. In the end, more than 300 bags of medium-grade Beijing-Zhenjiang wheat were traded at a price of 6.82 yuan. Due to quality reasons, the selling price was particularly low. It is heard that the goods were subsequently handled by Japanese merchants.

### Domi Rice Hoarders Wait and See; Merchants Lower Prices for Medium-Grade Rice

The sources of Domi rice from various groups, there are fourteen or fifteen from He Xia, more than three thousand bags from Che Lun Bao Zi, Su Tong Kun and other groups. Although the arrival of goods seemed larger, sellers, seeing that the weather was still overcast, had firm intentions and held on to prices. However, sales were not good, and both local and hoarders were mostly waiting and watching, so most goods could not be sold, and the market showed a stable and soft situation. If the thick and thin japonica rice was already depreciated by a few fen, the Domi Yang Jian, Bu Jian, and Bian Yuan rice kept the original price with equal supply and demand.

Merchant: Although recent arrivals have been small, the market is ultimately tired due to weak sales. Yesterday, from Nanjing and Wuhu, about three thousand bags were transported by Che Lun through two routes. Merchants have displayed samples for sale, and each grade of medium and lower-grade rice is especially trying to lower prices and sell early, because the inventory of medium and lower-grade rice is relatively abundant, and it is easy to steam and mold after the weather is hot, so they are unwilling to shelve it for too long. However, merchant hoarders were still waiting and watching yesterday, and only more than 1,000 bags went to the local market. The market price showed a small increase of 6 to 7 fen for high-quality goods, and a decrease of about 1 jiao for medium and lower-grade goods.

### Yarn and Cloth Recover from Danger; Cotton Yarn Hoarders Seize the Opportunity to Cut Losses; 20-Count Yarn Fails to Move Forward with Coarse and Fine Yarns

The yarn market is still in a stable state, but actual demand is not as strong as it used to be, so people's sentiment is slightly stable and in a state of hesitation. However, transactions along the Guangxi route are still substantial, transported from Guangzhou Bay, making the business of 20-count "Shuang Ma Te Jin Cheng" (Double Horse Special Golden City) more active. However, the absorption of the Yunnan group is slightly sluggish, and the Chaoshan group purchases and resells to the rear, so the market transactions can still be supported, and the market price is extremely peaceful. However, some hoarders, having experienced risk, held firmly when prices were low, never cutting losses, and have now recovered from danger, considering themselves satisfied and slightly profitable, and are seeking to sell in the market, so the market price is still hovering around 402-3 yuan. Whether new initiatives will be discovered in the future depends on actual sales to drive it. However, the price of 10-count yarn is steadily moving forward, and the market prices of 32-count and 42-count yarn are very high. If 20-count yarn maintains the current ratio, it could also support the rise. In the afternoon, traders and hoarders searched for them, which was extremely prosperous.

The current yarn situation shows that at the opening of the market in the early morning, Hong Kong merchants still had needs, but the purchases were less than the previous day, and the opening price remained the same. The price of 20-count "Shuang Ma" (Double Horse) yarn was 402 yuan, an increase of 5 jiao compared to the previous day. A short time later, Guangxi merchants also came to purchase, and the market showed an increasing trend, gradually rising to 403 yuan. Later, there was a slight unloading due to profitable bulls and the stagnation of business, resulting in a decline. By the closing, the price of 20-count "Shuang Ma" yarn was 401.5 yuan. Sales to merchants were good in the afternoon, and hoarders' absorption was even more fierce, causing the market price to rise. In the end, the total number of transactions throughout the day was 1,590 bales, and the market prices of 20-count "Shuang Ma" and "Tian Nv" (Fairy Maiden) were comparable to those of the previous day. The rising trend of 10-count yarn was very strong, and 32-count and 42-count yarn followed closely behind. The factory De Feng opened with 600 bales of 10-count "Shuang Shi" (Double Lion) at a price of 308 yuan, 400 bales of 80-count "Shuang Shi" at a price of 304 yuan, and 50 bales of 60-count "Jin Shuang Shi" (Golden Double Lion) at a price of 288.5 yuan, successively delivering goods. Yesterday, 20 pieces of yarn arrived from Hong Kong. Today's cotton yarn exports include 520 pieces transported to Tianjin, 340 pieces transported to Shantou, and 180 pieces transported to Hong Kong. The quotations of each group and the amounts of each count are listed on the left:

### The Subsidy Issue Still Lacks a Definite Solution; American Cotton Speculators Hastily Cover Short Positions; Market Prices Surge Sharply; Shanghai Trading Becomes Quiet

The price of foreign cotton in the market, the New York analysis market, yesterday May rose another ten points; Shanghai manufacturers are deeply worried about the price of cotton rising again. It is not known the reason for the New York price increase at two o'clock, due to the approaching May delivery period, and previous colleagues' goods were released in anticipation of payments, thus the short position was extremely large. However, waiting for several days, daily rumors of released and export-subsidized cotton payments have persisted, yet there is still no definite solution. Thus, various short sellers are hastily covering their positions, causing the May price to surge twenty-five points in two days, July rising fourteen points, while new cotton from October onwards only rose three to five points. Recent European political turmoil and no increase in American cotton exports, coupled with difficulties in boosting fabric sales, are the primary reasons making it difficult for cotton prices to improve. Yesterday, India, including forecasts, fell half a rupee, Egypt rose more than ten points. Converted to legal tender, American cotton and Brazilian cotton increased by eight jiao per dan, Indian cotton fell by two jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by six jiao.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading: various factories have been very quiet due to the rising prices of foreign cotton. Moreover, many goods arrive daily, so factories are more relaxed about ordering raw cotton. The converted factory price of yesterday's cotton market is calculated as follows:

The firmness of the yarn market is said to be due to too many fixed-quota sales, exceeding normal levels. Thus, foreign firms are unwilling to open, and the squeezing continues unabated. Although actual trading is not brisk, the market price is difficult to loosen. The current month's price for 20-count Phoenix yarn is 360 yuan.

The local cotton business shows slight activity, but the market trend is neither particularly prosperous nor declining. Chinese merchant Yong'an Factory bought 500 bales of bundled cotton, also for blending with Indian spun yarn. De Feng Factory handled 100 bales of raw yarn. It is found that the factory is selling 6-count, 10-count, and 8-count coarse yarn on the market, and the quantity has approached five or six thousand bales. It should be replenishing raw materials, but it is forced to buy Indian cotton as a substitute. In fact, because local cotton prices are high and cash is scarce, the future of the cotton market is in an awkward situation, with no exciting prospects. The supply from northern Jiangsu is as rare as morning stars; only 137 bales of Tong cotton arrived at the wharf. The situation of existing cotton is recorded on the left:

### Silk and Tea; Raw Silk Sets a New Record; the Highest Price in Nearly Ten Years; This City's Re-reeled Silk Follows with a 50 Yuan Increase

The overseas silk price increase is very strong. Yokohama spot prices opened at 1,190 to 1,200 yuan, the highest price record in nearly ten years. The forward price is 1,094 yuan, an increase of 57 yuan and 47 yuan respectively. The New York silk market is striving to follow: raw silk 83 points rose 7 points, 75 points rose 8 points, Shanghai silk 78 points rose 7 points. The recent standard silk opened at 2.43 yuan, proving the previous day's telegram transmission of 2.26 yuan was an error for 2.36 yuan, thus it also rose by 7 points. The forward price rose 7.5 points. The Japanese and American silk markets are almost in a white-hot state. New York City's silk transaction volume reached 2,270 bales, and the robust situation can be seen generally. However, this afternoon, Yokohama closed, except for this month's recent gains of 5 yuan, all other goods from spot to futures for each month have fallen back, with the spot price falling 10 yuan and the forward price falling 25 yuan.

The local silk market seemed more chaotic yesterday. Since Japan and the United States announced a surge in prices, which seemed to have no end, people were surprised, delighted, and suspicious, with no consensus. This caused the white filature silk transaction to turn sluggish and wait-and-see. Most transactions were for purchases ordered by foreign firms based on telegrams sent the previous day. 7/8-grade white filature rose 20-30 yuan yesterday, and re-reeled silk from six companies, Qilin horse-racing grade, rose 50 yuan. It is estimated that 50 bales of white filature and 90 bales of re-reeled silk were traded. The price for B-grade white filature in the user silk market was 1,600 yuan. Because buyers had little interest in buying, the silk price seemed difficult to rise quickly. The market price for dried cocoons opened and had already risen to 440 yuan, a rise of 30 yuan from the previous week. Therefore, the silk capital will be raised to above 1,650 yuan.

On the 19th, 100 tons of tea for export were shipped to Europe; on the 20th, another 84 pieces were shipped to Tianjin, 17 pieces to Qingdao, and 18 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Oil Cake; Rumors of Over a Thousand Barrels of Oil Arriving Daily; Prices Plunge by One Yuan; Raw Oil Also Expected to Fall

Yesterday, there was no market for peanut oil buying and selling. It is feared that prices will have to fall because the sources are not connecting. In addition to various other oils arriving one after another, rumors circulated in the market yesterday that over a thousand barrels would arrive daily, causing people to panic, reducing appetite, and the market turned downward. The rare price increase came to an abrupt end. Dalian spot oil fell by one yuan, with 150 barrels traded, the price falling from 44.5 yuan to 44 yuan. Another 50-odd barrels of road goods were priced at 43.8 yuan. Only 100 pieces of Dalian large-basket oil were traded, the price falling from 42.5 yuan to 42 yuan, rebounding by two jiao at closing to 42.2 yuan. One hundred pieces of Jiaozhou oil from road goods were opened, priced at 32 yuan.

### Imports and Exports; Another 2,000 Fresh Eggs Arrive; Exports Include Egg Yolk, Egg White, and Intestines

Fresh eggs are arriving in Shanghai in a steady stream. On the 18th, 2,040 pieces arrived from Xingang; on the 19th, another 250 pieces arrived from Tianjin.

Exported goods: on the 18th, 1,000 tons of egg yolk and egg white were shipped to London; on the 19th, 100 tons of [text missing] cloth were shipped to Germany; 25 pieces of pig intestines were shipped to Europe.

### Sugar Market; Broken Green Sugar is Cheap; The Price Surge of Foreign Sugar Has Already [text missing]

Yesterday, the price surge of foreign sugar had already [text missing]. The guild allocated the plate, and No. 24 coarse white sugar and Taikoo cart white sugar were all at the original price, with few transactions. The near-term May-June futures of coarse white sugar were at 5.45 Dutch guilders (per dan), with 2,000 bags traded. The far-term September-October futures were at 5.25 Dutch guilders, with 2,000 bags opened. Among domestic sugars, the Guangdong merchant opened 250 bags of Shimen broken green sugar, with a relatively poor quality and a price of 11 yuan. The Jiangnan merchant opened a hundred-odd bags of ordinary Diao green sugar, at 13.3 yuan. The Chaozhou merchant opened genuine cotton red sugar at 15.5 yuan. On the 18th, 1,920 bags of sugar arrived from Xiamen.

### Piece Goods; Fuzhou Merchants Telegraph to Stop Loading; Actual Sales in Sichuan and Yunnan Turn Sluggish Again; Signs of a Price Surge in Coarse Cloth Are Already Visible

Domestic Cloth

The sales plate for bleached and dyed fabrics is stable, and the actual needs of the Nanhua merchants are turning sluggish. Because the Yunnan-Guizhou mail parcels, which had been suspended for 40 days, were only restored on the 17th, the mail is extremely congested. It is heard that receipt and dispatch will be temporarily suspended again, so the purchase of goods for dressing up must be postponed again. Transactions are turning clear, and the delivery of goods already purchased is still strong. The Fuzhou merchants are deeply wary of Japanese warships intercepting and detaining ships. On the night of the 18th, they telegraphed to stop handling all goods, and those already handled will be loaded slowly. Only the Guangdong Shantou and Leizhou ports have better appetite, with 6,000-odd pieces of colored cloth, twill bleached cloth, and lustring traded. The sales trend of white cloth and fine cloth is firm. Fine cloth has risen by 5-10 fen, and Dapeng brand has risen by 5 fen. Spot sales are open at 13.75 yuan, and 30-50 bales of forward May-June goods are open for sale at 14 yuan. The sales plate for fine twill has risen by about 1 jiao. Dye factories and outside investors are the most active traders, with a total of over 300 bales traded. Coarse cloth and coarse twill have been absorbed by hoarding, and with the support of actual sales, a price surge has been triggered. 600-odd bales have been traded by merchants in this street and the Wenzhou-Taizhou merchants in eastern Zhejiang, with Yihua goods accounting for the largest share. The sales plate for Yihua coarse cloth is out of stock and has risen by 5-10 fen. The inventory of Dasheng Factory coarse cloth is running low, and the market price has surged. 16-pound Kuizi Blue Lion has risen by 3 jiao per piece.

Eastern Cloth

Yesterday, actual sales were cleared, and the sales plate for fine cloth and fine twill were mediocre. However, there were still 7-800 pieces traded by merchants in this street buying and selling each other. Only the Qingdao merchants bought 200-odd bales of 12-pound colored ball fine cloth, with a price of about 13.2 yuan per piece. The firm did not open goods, and the broadcloth and serge on the market are still extremely popular. The market price for Four Gentlemen broadcloth has exceeded 4 jiao 5.5 fen per yard. Piece goods exports today: 145 pieces shipped to Tianjin, 170 pieces to Yantai, 300 pieces to Shantou, and 125 pieces to Hong Kong.

### The Honor of Xue Li Hong (Pickled Mustard Greens)

‚Äî Qiu Lang

Xue Li Hong (also written Xue Li Hong, abbreviated as Xue Cai, or snow vegetable) in cuisine can be said to be the most common side dish, because it is cheap and delicious, so it is often included in Ms. Hua Ying's economic menu in this magazine, such as Xue Cai fried tofu, Xue Cai braised yellow croaker, etc. In meat dishes, adding a little of it will surely enhance the flavor. It is just like licorice in Chinese medicine, which is useful everywhere.

According to recent news reports from Singapore, China's Xue Li Hong (pickled vegetables) has recently been shipped to London, England, for the first time. After being tested by British physicians, it was found that this vegetable contains a large amount of vitamins and is very nutritious, and was crowned with the beautiful name of "Life Vegetable." This also shows that tastes are shared, regardless of China or foreign countries. China has opened up a new source of profit for vegetable sales overseas and has gained praise from people in foreign lands, which can be regarded as an honor!

According to the Ci Yuan dictionary: "Xue Li Hong is a vegetable plant with sharp serrated and notched leaves, similar to mustard greens, but the leaves are slightly textured and the flowers are yellow. When other vegetables are damaged by frost in snowy weather, this vegetable alone remains green, hence the name. The taste is slightly spicy and is often pickled as a side dish. Northerners call it Chun Bu Lao (Never Old in Spring). According to the Tang Yun dictionary, the vegetable core is long, white, and red." Based on this, since it overwinters and grows in the snow, its nature may be similar to that of peas and is mature in nature, but this still needs to be confirmed with doctors and pharmacists.

Some people also call Xue Li Hong Yan Zha Cai (salt pickled vegetable). There is a story about this: "When Song Fan Wenzheng Gong (Zhongyan) was young, he was poor and studied in a Changbai monastery. He boiled two liters of millet and made a bowl of porridge, which solidified overnight. He cut it into four pieces with a knife, and ate two pieces every morning and evening, breaking off dozens of stems of pickled vegetables to eat with it." From this, we can know that the spirit of diligence and self-motivation of ancient sages is worthy of emulation by later generations.

Finally, I hope that those who make Xue Li Hong will not make it crudely and carelessly just because it sells well overseas. They should strive for improvement. While production should be increased, they should also pay attention to the deliciousness of the taste, so that they can maintain the sales in the overseas market for a long time.

### About Giving Up Seats on the Tram

‚Äî Ying Dai

Sitting in a tram and seeing a woman get on, because it is crowded and she cannot find a seat, you give up your seat to her. Everyone knows that this is so-called Western civilization. However, since this Western civilization was introduced to China, we often see Chinese people giving up their seats to foreign wives on the tram, but rarely see Westerners giving up their seats to Chinese women. Perhaps foreigners' so-called civilized etiquette has different distinctions, and on the other hand, it can also be seen how they view Chinese people.

In the tram, giving up seats is not limited to women. Seeing the elderly and children, you should also give up your seats to them. However, most Chinese people only know how to give up seats to women, but do not know how to give up seats to the elderly and young. Moreover, even among women, some people will only choose those who are well-dressed and beautiful to give up seats to, while women who are simply dressed and ugly are ignored even if they are standing in front of them. In fact, trams do not care about clothing and appearance. All women must be given seats, especially those who are carrying or holding children in their hands. You must give up seats to them even faster.

Seeing women, you should indeed give up seats. Seeing the elderly and children, you should also give up seats to them. But in my opinion, the scope of giving up seats on trams should not be limited to this. Even if a man is holding a child in his hand and cannot find a seat, you should also give up your seat to him. Also, if someone is carrying seven bags and eight bundles, and is unable to bear the weight, and gets on the tram but cannot find a seat, regardless of whether they are male or female, you should also give up your seat to them. Sometimes, when we are on the tram, we see villagers who rarely come to Shanghai getting on. They cannot find a seat and, because they rarely ride trams, they stand in the tram swaying from side to side, as if they are about to fall. We should also give up seats to these people who cannot stand in the tram. If we can do this, the meaning of giving up seats will be broader and more accurate.

On the other hand, whether they are the elderly or women, if someone gives up their seat to them, some people sit down and thank them with a smile as a sign of gratitude, but there are also those who sit down impolitely and ignore you, as if it is their due. In fact, it is a courtesy for someone to give you a seat. This is not a right that you are entitled to. It is only because someone is giving it to you from a perspective of sympathy. Then, if someone treats you politely, you should reciprocate with politeness. Although the person giving up the seat does not necessarily need to exchange your thanks, it is essential for the person being given the seat to thank them with a smile in order to show that you have manners. You must not have the mindset that they should give you a seat and ignore them. This point should also be known.

### Method for Improving Edible Salt

‚Äî Tian Xu Wo Sheng

Edible salt is a daily necessity for life. Whether consumed directly or indirectly, each person needs at least three qian per day. This is an ancient Chinese saying. Even physiologists say that each person needs at least 15 to 18 pounds of edible salt per year. In that case, ten pounds of salt per month is enough for a family of eight. It is entirely possible to make your own physiological saline to achieve perfection. The method is very simple and does not require mechanical equipment. Ordinary enameled basins are good tools. First, dissolve crude salt in five times its weight of water (that is, dissolve one pound of salt in four pounds of water). Then you will see that it is as dirty as mud. After standing for a while, wait for the mud to settle, and scoop the clear liquid into a magnetic basin. Separately, dissolve soda ash in five times its weight of water (soda ash is sodium carbonate, or you can use local alkali). Slowly add it to the salt water mentioned above, creating a good cloud-like condensate until no more clouds form. (The amount added varies depending on the salt produced in different places, generally as much as 20% or as little as 3%, be sure to stir it evenly. After that, filter a little of the clear liquid and try adding alkali liquid again, to the extent that no more clouds form.) Then use a cloth to filter out the sediment. Then add a little barium chloride solution to the clear liquid, also until no more clouds form. (Barium chloride can be purchased from Western pharmacies and also dissolved in 20 times its weight of water.) Then filter the clear liquid to remove the residue and put it in a magnetic basin. Dry it by boiling on the stove (stir constantly when dissolving and shrinking to prevent it from sticking to the bottom), then place it on a brick and spread it out to dry into a powder. It will be as white as snow and taste extremely delicious, even purer than commercially sold refined salt. This is the physiological saline sold in Western pharmacies. Shanghai needs to sell it for eight jiao per pound, but it is still not as pure. To test its purity, use its saline solution and test it with the above two items. If adding alkali water produces clouds, it is evidence that it contains calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate. If adding barium chloride produces clouds, it is evidence that it contains potassium and sodium sulfate. Potassium sulfate can treat obesity, so it can make people lose weight. If edible salt contains potassium salt, the accumulation will gradually reduce appetite, and vitality will be greatly affected. Vegetarians often become thin and withered like firewood because the potassium in plant-based foods can eliminate fat, and they cannot obtain pure green sodium to exchange for it. Moreover, crude salt contains even more sulfates, which can make matters worse. Therefore, I believe that the need for physiological saline in the home cannot be ignored. As the method mentioned above is very easy to operate, once a month is enough to make it for the entire month. Compared to washing rice and vegetables, which require daily arrangements, the complexity is incomparable. As for the cost, it is minimal. If the fuel used is wood instead of coal, you can also extract alkali from the wood ash yourself. But if it is pine wood, if the ash soaked in water does not feel slippery to the touch, then do not extract alkali. Now the price of alkali is extremely high, and residents in the inland can collect ash and make alkali everywhere, but because they are limited by the scope of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, it is inconvenient to include it in this article. Or perhaps I can write another article on the problem of clothing washing to contribute how.

Eggs are an excellent food for nourishing the body, and they are very rich in vitamins. There are many ways to prepare them, and it is really impossible to describe them all. In home cooking, such as poached eggs and egg drop soup, we can often eat them. When whitebait is on the market in spring, this fried whitebait with eggs is a very good seasonal dish. Whitebait, commonly known as noodles, has no taste when cooked alone and must be fried with eggs. Some chives sprouts must also be added to complement each other. In addition, there is another dish that also uses eggs. It is called egg skin with shredded meat and mixed with chives sprouts. Beat the egg yolks and whites together, spread them in an oiled pot to make egg skin, cut them into thick strips, then add boiled shredded meat and bamboo shoots, soaked chives sprouts, add soy sauce and sesame oil and mix. It tastes very refreshing. If you don't like to eat chives sprouts, then you can substitute water celery or mung bean sprouts. If you want to eat something more elaborate, then don't use shredded meat, just use shredded chicken and shredded ham, which is also not impossible.
