### Japanese Troops Landing at Qinzhou Bay Unsuccessful; Chinese Defense Works Extensively Deployed; Japanese Attempt to Build Military Airfield at Landing Point; Japanese Troops Near Longmen, Fangcheng, Repelled

Chongqing - Sources familiar with the current situation here state that whether the Japanese troops advance towards Beihai or attack Nanning, they will be met with strong resistance from the Guangxi and Guangdong armies. The Guangxi and Guangdong armies stationed at the Japanese landing sites along the coast of Qinzhou Bay are elite troops commanded by Generals Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi. They are currently engaging the Japanese army within well-prepared defensive fortifications. Simultaneously, the roads in this area have long been destroyed by the Chinese side and turned into mud, effectively hindering the rapid advance of Japanese mechanized units. Furthermore, villages within a ten-mile radius on both sides of the existing roads have also been completely destroyed. These defensive measures by the Chinese side were prepared as early as eighteen months ago. Therefore, the Japanese attempt to cut off Guangxi's external communication lines will ultimately be an empty dream, at best resembling the situations in Xiamen and Shantou.

Tokyo - According to Japanese reports this morning, the Japanese troops who landed near Beihai continued to advance inland yesterday. The newly landed Japanese troops are constructing a military airfield at the landing point. The Japanese naval air force will use this as a base to provide cover and support during the army's attack on Nanning, Guangxi. Japanese official statements and newspapers have not mentioned the true purpose of the Japanese troops, but the news of this airfield construction has been confirmed by the Naval Ministry. The Japanese official announcement stated that the Chinese army at that location has been defeated and routed by the Japanese army. A statement from the Japanese Army Ministry claimed that the Japanese army encountered no resistance when landing at Beihai, with only one person injured. The climate there is very harsh, with wind and rain. (Sixteenth United Press special correspondent dispatch)

Chongqing - Today, this city received telegraphs from the Chinese side in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, stating that the Japanese troops landed near Longmen at 3:00 PM yesterday, threatening Fangcheng and Qinzhou, west of Beihai. The Japanese are also attempting to land within Beihai proper. It is reported that fighting is currently underway near Longmen. (Sixteenth Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing - According to Chinese sources today, the Japanese troops landed at Longmen yesterday were repelled by the Chinese side. However, the Japanese then sent a large number of reinforcements, completing the landing operation. It is also reported that Japanese cavalry have landed at Fangcheng, behind Qisha. However, Chinese reinforcements have rushed to the Longmen Bay area. According to senior Chinese military officials, based on the events of the past 24 hours, the Japanese landing operation is entirely a naval undertaking, with only small units of the army involved. At the same time, the Japanese troops in that area are also small units, so there will not be large-scale activities. The senior Chinese military official also stated that although the Japanese troops who landed at Longmen suffered a fierce counterattack from the Chinese army, they are still able to resist the Japanese army. (Eighteenth United Press dispatch)

Guilin - A certain military observer stated when meeting with reporters this afternoon that the Japanese activities in the Beihai area were expected. Based on the situation in the past 24 hours, the Japanese are mainly using naval forces, with very few army troops. Their forces are limited, and it seems difficult to have large-scale actions. The Japanese troops at Longmen have already been repelled, and although there are still remnants in Qisha putting up resistance, it will not be difficult to eliminate them. (Sixteenth dispatch)

Beihai is currently the only coastal area in China that has not been occupied by the Japanese army. It is not surprising that the Japanese army has now occupied this area. The spokesperson declined to comment on the possibility that the Japanese army may cut off the connection between Guangzhou Bay and mainland China. French officials stated that although this move by the Japanese army will not immediately affect France's interests in the Far East, the French authorities will gradually pay close attention to this matter. France will cooperate with Britain and the United States to strive to protect the rights of Western democratic countries in China. (Sixteenth United Press special correspondent dispatch)

Xingji - After Xiangning County was captured by the Japanese on the 24th of last month, the Chinese army occupied the high ground outside the city and attacked the Japanese army at any time. On the evening of the 11th of this month, the Chinese army launched an attack from four directions. Starting at 1:00 AM on the morning of the 12th, each route advanced and began fierce fighting with the Japanese army. By the afternoon, they had resolutely recaptured all the nearby strongholds and pressed on the city gates from all sides. The Japanese army retreated to the city. On the evening of the 12th, the Japanese army harassed areas such as Fujia Yuan and Ji Jia Yuan, but were repelled by the Chinese army. Fierce fighting continued throughout the 13th. The Japanese army was ultimately unable to reverse the downward trend. The Japanese troops in Hejin and Fencheng urgently dispatched reinforcements.

### Japan's Economic Warfare Against China

Since Japan's invasion of China over two years ago, it has been exhausting its troops abroad and mobilizing its people at home, wavering at the crossroads of peace and war. Now, the news of the landing at Beihai has arrived. Beihai is a coastal port in the south of Hepu County. It was opened as a commercial port in the second year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. Initially, it served as the entry and exit point for products from Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. However, with the subsequent opening of Wuzhou, Nanning, Mengzi and others, it lost its commercial importance. Today, the Japanese army suddenly landed at Beihai, with the sole intention of cutting off the highway between Guangxi and Vietnam and attempting to attack Nanning (now called Yongning)! According to what the people of the Japanese Naval Ministry have declared; "The goal is to tighten the blockade of the South China coast. After the fall of Beihai, all Chinese seaports will be in Japanese hands," etc. It can be seen that their intention lies, in addition to military considerations, placing particular emphasis on economic ones. Nanning is the distribution center for goods in the Xijiang River basin, known as the "Guangxi Warehouse." It was opened as a commercial port in the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. Its commercial prosperity rivaled Wuzhou. Goods transported by sea mostly took the route through Beihai, and now there is a highway connecting Annam's Dong Dang and Lang Son. But even if the Japanese occupy the port of Beihai, it will be difficult to succeed in advancing north to spy on Nanning. Even if they want to cut off the Guangxi-Vietnam highway, the shortest distance is still 140 kilometers, which cannot be hoped to be achieved without preparing to sacrifice a large part of human and material resources. However, what is noteworthy is that the Japanese desire to end the war against China is like a child in urgent need of color, with a great sense of impatience. Now, in addition to military matters, politics and economy are being pursued simultaneously. Politics aside for now. Regarding the economic aspect, before occupying a place, they fear not destroying it to the fullest extent. Therefore, the bombing of airplanes often chooses undefended cities, destroying large commercial and industrial areas. After they have occupied it, they fear not encompassing everything thoroughly. Therefore, they take over all agriculture, industry, commerce, mining, shipping under the name of "control" and practice "monopoly." Knowing that a snake swallowing an elephant is difficult to digest, they seem not to care until they want to vomit and cannot.

Japan's economic warfare against China, in these past two years, has probably been regarded by themselves as a series of advances, full of pride. Their offensive in finance involves issuing "United Reserve Bank" banknotes in North China, thinking to seize the position of legal tender. Having difficulty succeeding, they turned to using banknotes from North China to exchange for foreign exchange in Shanghai, also without success. Then they thought to meddle in Central China, but the so-called "China Development" banknotes have difficulty gaining popularity in the occupied areas. They then shifted their fierce flames to customs duties, thinking that they could promote it without obstruction. Who would have thought that it would only increase the work on the abacus, and in practice, legal tender is still used for transactions, but it is merely a disguised increase in taxes. They also wanted to blockade the British concession in Tianjin and seize China's silver reserves. Although the British intend to seek compromise with the Japanese, they cannot easily change their Far East policy, which is based on trust and has been declared in advance. Without the consent and permission of the owner, they cannot dispose of their assets. This is what the British, who value contracts, are unwilling to do. As for the Japanese offensive against industry and commerce, on the one hand, they monopolize China's products and forcibly seize the property of Chinese people. It is called cooperation, but it is no different from communism. Merchants accumulate resentment and anger without expressing it. They then proceeded to undermine the commercial interests of third-country nationals. Without a Japanese "transport permit," goods could not be shipped to Shanghai, and at some ports, even "permits" were not issued, such as in the case of eggs. In short, the Japanese want all businesses and property in the occupied areas to be owned and operated by the Japanese, so as to facilitate their ability to plunder. Even if a peace agreement is reached, they will use the excuse of "fait accompli" and borrow for a long time without returning. This is why they seize so much without regard for anything. On the other hand, they also dump Japanese goods in the occupied areas, using unscrupulous merchants to impersonate national goods and sell them in the interior, and there are many such cases. According to reports from Chongqing, in the first eight months of this year, the value of Chinese products absorbed by Japan reached 435,640,000 yuan, while the value of Japanese goods imported into Chinese occupied areas reached 226,208,000 yuan. According to customs statistics, imports of foreign goods in the first, second, and third quarters of this year amounted to 1,061,731,564 yuan, of which Japanese goods accounted for 245,530,000 yuan, an increase of 116,334,000 yuan compared to the same period last year. This shows the intensity of Japanese dumping in the occupied areas. For the Japanese, it should be considered a cause for celebration. However, due to the unresolved military campaign against China, the opportunity to develop trade due to the European war was lost. As a result, it is not easy to obtain overseas raw materials and attract foreign exchange to save the increasingly powerful military system and the misfortune of industry and commerce. Then their gains in China may not compensate for their losses.

In addition, they are blockading various seaports under the control of the Chinese army. The blockade of the Wenzhou sea is sometimes tight and sometimes loose. The control of inland river and coastal shipping is increasing day by day. The Japanese's original mentality is still afraid that the control is not strict and that the net will leak fish. But they do not know that what the Japanese can control is Chinese goods, and what they cannot control is the hearts of the Chinese people. Moreover, military warfare is originally a rearguard or vanguard of economic aggression. If military warfare has a clear prospect of victory, then the economy is an object in the bag and can be planned slowly. If the victory or defeat of military warfare is still an unknown number, then the plunder of resources in the war zone is still feared not to be swept up completely. How can they delay for a moment. Therefore, it can be seen from the urgency of the economic strategy that the success or failure of the war can be seen. Then, as in the recent landing of the Japanese army at Beihai, who knows that the return of Hepu pearls is still not a short-term matter!

It is hoped that under the command of the supreme commander, they will work harder, gather great achievements as soon as possible, complete the work of the war of resistance, and achieve the cause of national construction. (2) The telegram to recognize overseas Chinese stated briefly, "Our Chinese nation has fought a desperate battle to defend national sovereignty and maintain world justice for twenty-nine months. Under the firm command of the supreme commander, the soldiers and civilians of the whole country are loyal and courageous, and they are becoming stronger as they fight. The foundation of victory has been laid, and the work of restoration can be seen. Our overseas Chinese have enthusiastically donated money, enabling all resources to be abundant over time. Their loyal plans and sincere considerations are mutually complementary with those who wear armor and fight on the front lines. Deeply thinking of their virtuous labor, we extend our sincere congratulations. We look forward to working together to accomplish great undertakings." (Sixteenth dispatch)

### Dong Xian Guang Warns the Philippines

Chongqing - Okabe, chairman of the Japanese International Culture Association, broadcast to the Philippines from Tokyo yesterday, stating that Japan has no ambition for the Philippines. Dong Xian Guang, Deputy Minister of Propaganda here, therefore warned the Filipinos, asking them not to over-believe this Japanese guarantee. This Japanese guarantee is completely empty talk. The sweet words that we have heard from the Japanese are even more touching than what Okabe said. Furthermore, Filipinos must be careful of the sweet words of Japanese politicians, because based on our experience, the Japanese often say one thing and do another. For example, Japan signed the Nine-Power Treaty with great seriousness, but Japan was the first to violate it. At the same time, before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan also issued the same guarantees to China, but it was soon proven that this guarantee was completely empty talk. (Sixteenth United Press dispatch)

### Current Military and Political Situation in Suiyuan

A telegram from a certain location in western Suiyuan states that after arriving here on the 15th, the reporter saw that the wartime operations in Suiyuan were showing a lively and vigorous atmosphere in all aspects. Since April of this year, the Japanese army has not advanced a single step along the Ping Sui line. In addition to controlling the front with a large army, the Chinese side has also launched a wide range of guerrilla warfare on both sides of the railway. The Japanese army has repeatedly attempted to suppress the railway line, but all have failed. In addition, the Chinese army destroyed dozens of miles of railway, which has not been opened to traffic for two months. The Japanese then used a large part of their troops to encircle and attack Wuan, between Guyang and Wuchuan in China, and were defeated and retreated a few days ago. In the cities and counties occupied by the Japanese, the county, district, and township chiefs all exercise their rights within the territory to mobilize the masses. More than 4,000 intellectuals who have fled from the war zone have established a middle school to pursue further studies. More than 10,000 troops from the anti-Japanese forces in the whole province have successively returned. The regular army of the Chinese army in Wuan and the Mongolian armies are fighting bravely. The cooperation between the army and the people is getting closer. Since this year, all land taxes have been partially exempted, and the people are celebrating. More and more people are returning from the occupied areas. The leaders of the whole province, as well as the soldiers and civilians, are all extremely hardworking, persevering, and advancing calmly. As for the Japanese situation, they have been repeatedly attacked for half a year. They are urgently building bunkers around the strongholds, bridges, warehouses, and barracks in Baotou, Guihua, Fengzhen, and other places, surrounded by iron nets. On October 1, the puppet regime merged the three puppet autonomous governments of Mengjiang, northern Shanxi, and southern Chahar into the "Mengjiang Autonomous Government," located in Zhangjiakou, and still ordered Prince De to preside over it, with actual power in the hands of Imai. The original 400 or so puppet civil servants are now only 60 or so, which is the result of Prince De's firm request. Prince De was once passive because of this matter. Opium is everywhere on the Mongolian grasslands, and the Japanese are forcing it to be planted, ordering 20 taels of dry soil per mu to be produced, and buying each tael for 70-80 cents, and selling it for 7-8 yuan in the official opium shops. The Japanese are spreading gambling and prostitution and using flattery and enticement to win over young people, and then using the poisonous scheme of (using Chinese to control Chinese), but all have been exposed. Recently, 100 Mongolian recruits were trained in the Ulanqab League, but all of them fled to the Chinese side in less than a month. The awakening of the Mongolian people is extremely worthy of attention. (Fifteenth dispatch)

### Chinese Production: Japanese Spies

Chongqing: The General Headquarters Military Affairs Department is currently preparing to produce a film based on the book "Japanese Spies" by Italian author Fan Shibo, for screening in theaters nationwide.

The purpose of producing this film is to make people understand Japan's methods of occupying Northeast China and its means of ruling the Northeast. Hundreds of male and female artists have already volunteered to act in the film, and thousands of Chinese soldiers are also participating. The China Film Production Company, which is responsible for producing the film, is currently running large advertisements in local newspapers to solicit a large number of leather jackets, leather hats, and leather boots worn by Japanese soldiers in Northeast China, as well as wooden clogs and kimonos worn by Japanese women, and clothes worn by Chinese women in 1931. It is said that the entire film will focus on the espionage methods used by Japan. (United Press dispatch, 16th)

### Military Affairs Commission Releases Weekly Battle Situation: 8th to 14th

Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since this week (November 8th to 14th), Japanese troops on all fronts have continued to stir, and the Chinese army has continued to fight bravely, inflicting repeated blows. The Japanese army, after suffering repeated defeats, has become greatly demoralized. The more important aspects of the combat situation are described below:

Shanxi-Henan Area: The fighting in Shanxi Province has remained fierce in western Shanxi this week. After the Japanese occupied Jixian, Daning, and Xixian counties last week, the Chinese army quickly explored the terrain and strategies, launching a pincer attack on Xiangning from the northwest of Hejin in the south, and attacking Kecheng from the southeast of Shilou in the north. They completely recovered the two major strongholds of Xiangning and Kecheng, and then advanced to attack the rear of the Japanese army. The Japanese army was unable to attend to both ends, and the entire line was shaken, collapsing simultaneously on all fronts. The southern route retreated from Jixian to Fencheng, the central route retreated from Daning to Pucheng, and the northern route retreated from Kecheng to QueLian. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy, killing countless numbers, creating a great victory in another annihilation battle in the area. A mopping-up operation against the remaining Japanese troops is currently underway. In eastern Henan, the Chinese army has been attacking the Japanese troops in Taikang for days, killing over 300. On the night of the 9th, they once reached the city gate, causing great panic among the Japanese troops. At the same time, more than 1300 Japanese troops in Xinyang, southern Henan, once again harassed the Pingchangguan area, and after repeated attacks, the Japanese suffered hundreds of casualties and their offensive was thwarted. In addition, Japanese troops in Junxian and Tangyin, northern Henan, have repeatedly advanced west of Puyang, and after fighting on separate routes for two days and nights, many Japanese were killed. The situation has now become quiet.

Hubei-Hunan-Jiangxi Area: The Japanese troops in Hanyang, Hanchuan, Qianjiang, and other places in central Hubei launched a two-pronged attack to the west last week, and Xiantao and Mianyang fell one after another, causing a tense situation at one time. Later, after a vigorous counterattack, important strongholds such as Fengkou and Tonghaikou were recovered one after another. In recent days, they have continued to advance, recovering Mianyang, and the vanguard has pressed to Xiantao, intensifying the siege. The Japanese suffered heavy losses. In addition, more than 2,000 Japanese troops on the left bank of the Xiang River have been attempting to cross to the east bank under the cover of artillery fire for days, but have been met with fierce resistance from the Chinese army and have not succeeded. The situation is currently in a stalemate. As for the northern Hunan-Jiangxi area, there have also been fierce battles in the past. On the northern Hunan front, the situation remains stalemated north of the Miluo River, up to the southeastern suburbs of Yueyang. On the right flank, the Chinese army is attacking Tongcheng and Linxiang, completely destroying Japanese transportation lines. The remaining Japanese troops in Tongcheng are still closely surrounded by the Chinese army, and their retreat route has been cut off and they will soon be completely annihilated. Another unit of the Chinese army attacked Linxiang County on the evening of the 11th, killing many Japanese. The Chinese army advancing towards Fengxin in northern Jiangxi once rushed into the city on the evening of the 10th, burning down the Japanese barracks and warehouses before safely withdrawing. More than 3,000 Japanese troops in the Wuning and Gao'an areas launched a large-scale three-pronged attack on Minshan for days, but were met with resistance on separate routes, and a strong force ambushed the rear of the Japanese army. After several days of bloody battles, the Japanese army retreated completely on all fronts. The Japanese so-called "mopping-up" attempt in northern Jiangxi was thus shattered once again.

### British Chancellor of the Exchequer Reports on Military and Diplomatic Situation in the House of Commons, Calls Dutch and Belgian Peace Appeals a Courageous Act, Alliance Between Britain and France Grows Stronger

London: Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, representing Prime Minister Chamberlain, delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, reporting on the diplomatic and military situation of the past week. He first mentioned the peace appeals issued by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, calling them courageous acts. However, he also said that Chamberlain had previously stated that, based on past experience, it was difficult to expect the German government to submit a satisfactory reply. King George VI of Britain had declared in a reply to the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands that any proposal that could form a reasonable basis for peace would be considered. However, German head of state Hitler gave a speech in Munich on the 9th of this month, deliberately misinterpreting British policy. The country's propaganda machine then distorted the replies submitted by Britain and France, claiming that they rejected the peace appeals. This shows that the answer submitted by the country did not open the door to a satisfactory peace solution. According to German official announcements, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop notified the envoys of Belgium and the Netherlands yesterday in the name of Hitler, saying that since the peace proposal had been rejected by Britain and France, the German government had no choice but to consider it hopeless. This is also a sophistry. As for the military situation of the past week, rumors of German aggression against Belgium and the Netherlands are rampant. The British government, in accordance with its consistent policy, is very willing to respect the neutrality of these countries. However, given the large number of German troops concentrated in areas bordering Belgium and the Netherlands, and the open threats made by the country's newspapers against these countries, German aggression is imminent. All discerning people have already seen through this. Under such circumstances, it is to be expected that countries around the world unanimously despise Germany's superficially expressed peaceful words. No one in our country overestimates these words, and it is unnecessary to repeat them. As for the naval war, many enemy merchant ships are still docked in their own or neutral ports, and dare not sail as usual. In the past week, a total of four enemy ships were intercepted by our side. On the 12th and 13th of this month, enemy ships were scuttled by their crews. As for the air war, enemy planes once raided the Shetland Islands in our country. In addition, the air forces of both sides have been very active in recent days, mostly in fragmented actions, and no fierce battles have occurred. In general, there has been no special activity in the military field in the past half month, but the strength of our country's military and the determination of our nation have been fully demonstrated." As for the international situation in the past half month, the position of the allied countries of Britain and France has become stronger and stronger. "After the establishment of the new U.S. Neutrality Act, it has been able to continue to supply us with the armaments that it can supply. This is very important. As for the negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union, they have in fact broken down, which is disappointing." In addition, Polish Prime Minister Sikorski is currently holding talks with our authorities here to discuss the issue of the country's army joining the Allied forces. As for the visit of French Finance Minister Reynaud, the two sides discussed various economic and financial issues, proving that their views are completely consistent. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

### British Cruiser Captures German Ship

London: A British cruiser recently captured a German ship at sea yesterday and ordered it to sail to a port in the west. All two or three dozen crew members have landed. This ship is probably the "Leonté" (900 tons). At the beginning of the European war, it had taken refuge in the Spanish port of Vigo and only attempted to escape its internment now. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

London: The Ministry of Economic Warfare announced that the British Contraband Control Committee detained 6,500 tons of contraband suspected of being shipped to Germany in the week ending November 11.

Two batches of goods were completely confiscated, 88 were completely released, and 43 had some goods confiscated. On November 11, there were 94 neutral ships berthed at the base of the British Contraband Control, 58 of which had been berthed at the base for less than a week. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

The Hague: According to a statement from the British Wartime Economic Bureau, 108 ships arrived at the southern seaports of Britain from November 5 to 11 to await inspection. The week before that, 86 ships arrived to await inspection, and they are still under British control and have not regained their freedom. It is reported that after inspection, the cargo of two ships was completely confiscated, and the cargo of 43 ships was partially confiscated. The cargo of 88 ships has already been released. However, according to a survey on November 14, there are still 94 neutral ships docked in British-controlled seaports. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)

### Encounters on Various Parts of the Western Front

Paris: The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 146, stating, "Patrols from both sides engaged in encounters on various parts of the front today, and artillery fire from both sides was also very active." (Havas dispatch, 15th)

Paris: The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 147, stating, "Nothing worthy of mention occurred on the front last night." (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Paris: Le Petit Parisien today published an article by Maurice, saying that both sides on the Western Front now seem to be waiting for the right moment to act, and the reported fighting is only a matter of some activity by the pickets. German pickets are only composed of a small number of soldiers in the dense forest areas of the Moselle and Rhine positions, located in the northeast area of Bitche and between the Lauter River, which has been the destination of German activity in the past few days. The Germans have also sent many reconnaissance patrols to operate in the lower reaches of the Vosges River to investigate the location of French resistance. The French are also engaged in reconnaissance, in enemy concentration areas outside the French line of defence, according to today's Figaro. German artillery recently engaged in firing at a certain point in the Moselle River area, (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

### Several Ships Continue to Sink in European Waters, Two Lithuanian Ships and Two British Ships

Lithuanian National Capital: The Lithuanian cargo ships "Panaman" (2,400 tons) and "Nidan" (1,900 tons) recently sank one after another in the Estonian sea in the Baltic Sea. The "Nidan" was carrying a batch of British coal. The fate of the crew of the two ships is still unknown. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

London: The British oil tanker Woodtown (794 tons) sank within one minute after an explosion today. Nine crew members drowned and four were sent to the hospital. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

London: The British ship "George" (2,316 tons) recently struck a derelict ship floating in the northeastern waters of Britain and sank as a result. All crew members have been rescued. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

Panama: The British regular liner "Matararo" (12,390 tons) recently arrived here. According to the crew, the ship was chased by a German submarine for 50 minutes en route from Britain to New Zealand. The British ship was eventually spared because of its greater speed. When the German submarine was first sighted, it was two and a half miles away. The captain immediately turned the wheel and accelerated forward. The submarine chased behind until it was about seven miles away. Although the British ship had defensive equipment, the captain said that he was ordered not to open fire unless attacked. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Beijing: The Belgian small steamer "Maurice, Margaret" sank in Dunkirk after hitting a French mine. Three sailors were buried at sea. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)

### Britain Trains Air Force Across the Country

London: It is reported that two young air force officers who recently won the British Empire Medal previously learned aviation as bus drivers and members of a flying club, practicing for half an hour a day. After half a month, they obtained a pilot's license. In April of this year, they were promoted to junior officers in the Air Force, and now they have won the officer's Empire Medal for their proficiency in skills and courageous behavior. This shows the effectiveness of British pilot training. This training system has now been implemented in all parts of the Empire. The main training center is currently in Canada, with 4,000 people currently being trained and 10,000 to 15,000 people on the waiting list. India has now opened an Indian Air Force training station, and local princes are donating huge sums of money to develop air defenses, and the Prince of Hyderabad is even paying for the entire team of an air force detachment. Because there is gasoline supply in Iraq, it is also engaged in pilot training. Trainees from Australia will be trained in Egypt because the climate in Egypt is especially suitable. As for Germany, due to limited oil reserves, pilot training is very difficult, which is very different from the convenience of Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

### Rumor of Britain and France Forming a Customs Union Denied by British Officials

London: There were rumours spreading that after French Finance Minister Reynaud came here and held talks with Finance Minister Simon, the two countries could form a customs union. However, official sources recently emphatically denied this, saying, "The talks were limited to technical issues arising from economic cooperation. For example, issues such as currency and exchange controls, and promoting trade, were all submitted for discussion, but both sides have no intention of unifying currencies at present, and France has never proposed this. In general, Britain and France have completely consistent views on current issues, but there is no need to establish a customs union" (Havas dispatch, 16th)

### German Planes Attack Shetland, Bombs Miss

London: According to the latest news, when German planes raided the Shetland Islands twice on Sunday, at least 16 heavy bombs were dropped. The previous report of 12 was inaccurate. Four of the bombs were deeply embedded in a certain muddy mountain area and did not explode. They were found last night and were all bombs capable of penetrating armor, each weighing about 250 pounds. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

### German-Swedish Business Negotiations

Berlin: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry yesterday denied the report that Germany had put forward certain demands during business negotiations with Sweden. The spokesman said that the German-Swedish business negotiations are temporarily suspended, and the representatives of the two sides are waiting for new instructions from the government. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)

### Germany Intensifies Training of Officers

Paris: According to reliable sources here, there is evidence to indicate that Germany is actively striving to train officers through mass production methods. It is reported that Germany is still short of 15,000 officers, and even among the front-line officers, many lack sufficient experience. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

### Soviet-German Consultations on Opening Air Route

Moscow: More than 40 people from German business circles arrived here yesterday, including four representatives from German airlines, who will consult with the Soviet authorities on opening an air route between Moscow and Berlin (via Warsaw).

### Hungary Cracks Down on Political Activities

Hungarian National Capital: Interior Minister Fecher delivered a speech in the House of Representatives yesterday evening, stating, "The government will do its utmost to suppress any kind of incitement." Members of the Parliament here were very satisfied after hearing this, saying, "The authorities of this country arrested several members of the National Socialist Party a few weeks ago. The party's members immediately withdrew from the House of Representatives to protest. Now, Interior Minister Fecher has made this speech in response to the party, which is deeply supported by the majority of members of other parties in the Parliament," (Havas dispatch, 16th)

### British Trade Delegation Arrives in Madrid

### US Newspapers Advocate Maintaining an Independent Policy in the Far East, Cautioning Against British and French Flattery of Japan

New York: The New York Daily News today warned the United States to be wary of the Allies' "flattery of Japan." It said, "We must remember that Britain and France never supported the United States in taking a firm stance against Japan's conquest of Manchuria in 1931." The newspaper's editorial was titled "Flattery of Japan," and solemnly stated the importance of the United States maintaining an independent policy in the Far East, saying that after Britain and France withdraw their troops stationed in China, there is no reason for the United States' Far East policy to soften. "If we abandon our independent policy, we will gain nothing and will suffer all kinds of losses. It is very clear that the Allies are bargaining with Japan. A replay of the events of 1931 is happening. In 1931, we alone strongly protested against the Japanese military's invasion of Manchuria, while Britain isolated the United States and did not support it" (United Press dispatch, 16th)

Washington: The Standard Star newspaper recently commented on the withdrawal of some troops stationed in North China by Britain and France, briefly stating that Britain and France have not abandoned their rights in China, and the firm attitude taken by the United States government should be maintained. "The U.S. government is about to announce the abrogation of the 1911 U.S.-Japan trade agreement, and is also consolidating naval bases in the Pacific. In addition, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan recently expressed his dissatisfaction with the Japanese military's actions in China during a speech in Tokyo. The U.S. government has also sent a submarine fleet to the East Asian seas. All of this, in Japan's view, should be regarded as a warning that although the war hawks in that country want to exclude third countries in the Far East, the Western countries will not be willing to back down" (Havas dispatch, 15th)

### Cornerstone Laid for Statue of Former US President Jefferson, Roosevelt Attends and Speaks

Washington: The city is building a statue of the late President Jefferson, and the cornerstone laying ceremony was held yesterday. President Roosevelt personally attended and delivered a speech. "I very much hope to come again to participate in the unveiling ceremony of the late President's statue in January 1941." People then commented that President Roosevelt's term of office was originally due to expire on March 4, 1941, and what he said may imply that he will still submit his candidacy in next year's election, which is not impossible. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

### Tonnage of New US Cruisers May Increase

Washington: Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison recently gave a speech to the press, saying that the US Navy has obtained extremely valuable lessons from observing the ongoing war in Europe, which can be used to build the new cruisers "Columbia" and "Crane Fulun." According to the current shipbuilding program, the tonnage of these two ships is 8,000 tons, and construction has not yet begun. However, since the provision in the London Naval Treaty prohibiting the construction of 10,000-ton cruisers has lost its effect due to Japan's lack of restraint, the tonnage of the "Columbia" and "Crane Fulun" may be increased. Regarding this level, well-informed sources here say that these new cruisers may be modeled after the German pocket cruisers. However, Secretary Edison said that the German pocket cruisers have not proven to be superior to similar warships from other countries, and the United States can still build better cruisers. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

### New Antarctic Land to Belong to the United States

Boston: The first Antarctic expedition to be organized by the US government in a century has decided that the motor ship North Star, which is setting out for the first time, will set sail for Little America near Antarctica today. The leader of the expedition, the famous explorer Admiral Byrd, will board the North Star later and declare that the land he has discovered belongs to the United States. He believes that it can be a safer new base for aviation between the United States and Australia. According to reports, Byrd was the first person to fly over the North and South Poles and one of the first to fly across the Atlantic. He completed these three great achievements in three and a half years, so he became famous before he turned forty. Byrd also made a name for himself in the US Naval Aviation Corps during the war.

### Rosemary Wins Lawsuit

London. Judge Burke of the High Court ruled today on Princess Hohenlohe's case against Lord Rosemary for breach of contract, finding in favor of Lord Rosemary. All allegations were dismissed. The plaintiff made two claims: (1) Damages for wrongful dismissal or cancellation of the employment contract. The court found that there was no stipulation preventing the plaintiff from accepting 25,000 pounds from an American publisher for publishing Hungarian sports manuscripts. Furthermore, the plaintiff's salary was paid until the end of 1938, at which point the contract would have expired without any notice from either party. (2) The defendant's obligation, in January 1933, to clear the plaintiff's name regarding defamatory news published in a French newspaper and to provide financial assistance. The court found that the defendant never assumed an obligation in the contract to clear the plaintiff's name or agreed in the contract to provide an annual allowance of 5,000 pounds to support the plaintiff for life. As for the confidential documents presented in court, none of them contained anything that would damage the reputation of the defendant or the sender. Any person of repute would naturally not want confidential correspondence with foreign heads of state to be disclosed in court. The court also found that the plaintiff obtained copies of these letters not from her employer, the defendant, but from individuals in Europe who corresponded with the defendant. The plaintiff has not provided a satisfactory explanation for how this occurred. Moreover, the plaintiff has been unable to continue obtaining confidential letters from the German Chancellery since January 1929, that the defendant had sent to the German Chancellery.

### Soviet Furs Shipped to Germany

Berlin. The Leipzig Fur Trade Delegation recently returned from Leningrad, where they inspected Soviet furs. It is reported that the Soviet Union will ship furs worth one million marks to Germany, including 14,000 Persian lambskins and 400 silver fox pelts. (Haitong Telegraph, 16th)

### Soviet-Finnish Relations Worsen; Finland Actively Prepares; Finnish Representative Claims Negotiations Still Sought

Helsinki. After the Finnish delegation returned here from Moscow, the Finnish cabinet convened a cabinet meeting to discuss whether the Finnish government should make a final effort to promote the resumption of Soviet-Finnish negotiations through diplomatic channels. It is also learned that the Soviet Minister to Finland is currently in Moscow and is not expected to return to his post for the time being. (Reuters, 16th)

Swiss National Capital. A correspondent for the Neue Zürcher Zeitung in the Finnish National Capital recently wired that, according to Finnish military sources, regardless of the outcome of future talks between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Finnish National Government will maintain all precautionary measures taken until the end of the European war. However, the current troop levels will be reduced as the defensive works currently under construction are completed. It is also reported that responsible individuals in the country stated that the Finnish National economic and financial situation is very sound, preparations have not yet been utilized, and it will not be difficult to maintain the current precautionary measures to the greatest extent possible. Considering that Finland's foreign debt, calculated per capita, requires only one thousand Finnish marks per person, one can see the extremely good financial situation. (Havas, 16th)

Moscow. Soviet newspapers have recently been attacking Finnish reactionaries, claiming that they want to extend their country's borders to the Soviet Ural Mountains. At the same time, they are fiercely conducting anti-Soviet propaganda, falsely claiming that Soviet Russia is the same as Tsarist Russia, and failing to recognize that their country's independence was restored thanks to the Soviet October Revolution. Finnish newspapers have been inciting hatred towards the Soviet Union, and the Finnish authorities have even been guiding the people by killing Soviet soldiers. In short, the country is now leaning towards Western countries, especially those that have always been hostile to the Soviet Union. (Havas, 16th)

Helsinki. After meeting with the President, the chief representative of the Finnish delegation, Paasikivi, met with journalists yesterday and stated that neither Finland nor the Soviet Union has explicitly stated that the Soviet-Finnish negotiations have broken down, but the date for resuming negotiations has not yet been decided. Finland is still prepared to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union. At the same time, Finland fully trusts the treaties previously signed with the Soviet Union. Regarding the state of military preparations in Finland, Paasikivi declined to comment. Paasikivi then solemnly denied that Soviet aircraft had attacked Finnish coastal cities. (Haitong Telegraph, 16th)

Helsinki. The Moscow radio station today again attacked Finland with strong words, accusing the Finnish rulers of being under the protection of Britain. This is the second attack on Finland by the Moscow radio station since the suspension of Soviet-Finnish negotiations. The first attack occurred on the day the Finnish delegation was recalled, accusing Finland of failing to notify the Soviet authorities of the flood threat from border rivers. This second attack occurred shortly after the Finnish representative arrived in Finland. The chief Finnish representative, Paasikivi, told people after returning home that the Soviet claim of Finnish economic difficulties was absurd and that economic pressure from the Soviet side had no effect on Finland. Finland is currently implementing various precautionary plans to cope with other possible difficulties. (Reuters, 15th)

Danzig. According to the Danzig Times today, citing as-yet-unconfirmed reports, the Soviet Union is planning to abolish the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty. Finnish sources also claim that Finland has completed the construction of fortresses and defensive works in the area bordering the Soviet Union, and Finnish troops have moved into new positions to defend them. As for the neuro-warfare that the Soviet Union intends to adopt, Finland is also prepared to experience it. It is expected here that after the Finnish Finance Minister Tanner returns here from Moscow, he will issue several laws restricting the economy and finances to cope with the pressure from the Soviet side. At the same time, Finnish officials are confident that Finland will be able to borrow foreign debt, at least from Sweden and the United States. Domestically, the government's national defense bonds worth ten million US dollars have been fully sold, and the Finnish people's patriotic donations have reached as much as 1.5 million US dollars. (United Press, 16th)

Helsinki. A large storm occurred in the Gulf of Finland, and the water level of the Neva River rose three feet, causing considerable damage to the village of Leningrad. The Soviet side therefore criticized Finland, claiming that if Finland's weather reports had not stopped, the residents of Leningrad would have been able to take precautions. However, according to Finnish newspapers, Finland's weather reports have been stopped for several months, not just today, but have only recently been resumed. Therefore, the Soviet side's criticism is completely unfounded. Furthermore, according to reports from Tallinn, Estonia, a large storm occurred in the Gulf of Finland, damaging many of the Soviet seaplanes parked there. (United Press, 16th)

Moscow. Professor Bakh, a well-known Soviet biologist and member of the Academy of Sciences, (who attended the Supreme Soviet as a representative,) published an article in the Soviet trade union newspaper today, expressing indignation at the United States' interference in the Soviet Union's negotiations with Finland, and warning the United States to "mind its own business and not interfere in the affairs of others." According to Professor Bakh, President Roosevelt's sudden expression of concern for Finland has surprised the Soviet public, because the threat to Finland is not the Soviet Union, but its domestic leaders. The Finnish reactionaries are now acting as tools for war provocateurs, placing Finland entirely on a war footing, and causing the lives of the Finnish people to decline day by day. Moreover, the demands made by the Soviet Union on Finland are not only extremely reasonable, but have been conceded as much as possible. Our demands are absolutely indispensable to the Soviet Union. I firmly believe that the Soviet government will be able to carry out its original intentions to defend our industrial capital. Anyone who interferes with this action of the Soviet Union must be repelled with extreme determination. The United States, as a country of gold and monetary imperialism, has placed the entire Americas under its control in the name of the Monroe Doctrine. What qualifications does it have to speak on the actions of the Soviet Union? (United Press, 16th)

### Italy Maintains Armed Peace; Mussolini's Speech

Rome. Premier Mussolini delivered a speech yesterday from the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia to tens of thousands of people, including several thousand students. He said, "You must study in calmness and discipline, and keep a gun by your books. What our country wants to maintain is armed peace, not cowardly peace." Informed sources here commented that this is further proof that Italy is still taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the current European war. However, Italy is ready and will assume a peace mission when the opportunity arises. The entire meaning of the Prime Minister's speech regarding all current events is nothing more than that. Some observers also said that during yesterday's demonstration, the students shouted slogans such as "Corsica Tunis," but the crowd did not respond. However, Italy's desire for the Mediterranean and North African French territories has not been abandoned and can still be seen here. (Havas, 15th)

Rome. Italian Daily editor Gaida broadcasted to the United States today, saying that Italy hopes for a solution to the colonial problem. Italy was sold out by the Treaty of Versailles, which did not give Italy colonies. Italy's goal is the political and economic harmony of the Balkan countries and the free and equal solution of the colonial problem. Prime Minister Mussolini's calm and armed policy is based on waiting and vigilance. (Reuters, 16th)

### New British Ambassador to France Presents Credentials; Anglo-French Sincere Cooperation

Paris. The new British Ambassador, Sir Campbell, went to the Presidential Palace this morning to present his credentials to President Lebrun, and delivered a eulogy, stating that both countries can cooperate sincerely, fully understand each other, and must work together to cope with the current dangers. He said, "When my predecessor, Sir Phipps, presented his credentials to Your Excellency several years ago, our two countries already had the desire to maintain peace, and later made many efforts, but the desire for peace ultimately became a bubble. Today, our two nations are forced to fight against aggressive countries in order to defend a tradition of hundreds of years, and are well aware that the safety of the territory and the future are shaken. Only by achieving victory can we enjoy peaceful happiness and protect the right to exist. To achieve victory, our two countries must be united. As far as my country is concerned, we deeply admire the bravery and calmness of the people of your country, and will cooperate with all national resources. The fate of Europe depends on how our two countries cooperate. I am very honored to be able to contribute to this." President Lebrun immediately replied, "Your two countries' thoughts and actions are absolutely consistent, and the close relationship between the two countries is unprecedented." (Havas, 16th)

### Dutch-Belgian Peace Proposal; Germany Responds; Believes This Movement Has Ended; German Foreign Minister Meets with Belgian and Dutch Envoys

Swiss National Capital. According to Berlin sources, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop met with Belgian Ambassador Davignon and Dutch Minister Weede this morning and informed them in the name of Führer Hitler that the German government had no choice but to consider the peace proposal of Belgium and the Netherlands to have failed since it had been rejected by Britain and France. (Havas, 15th)

Paris. Diplomatic figures here commented on the fact that the German government did not respond to the peace proposal by the heads of Belgium and the Netherlands until today, saying that this is further proof that Germany's strategy is to shift the responsibility for prolonging the war onto Britain and France. Earlier, Belgium and the Netherlands had come forward to mediate once in late August, at which time Germany rejected it, claiming that it was launched too late and that the move was sufficient to facilitate Britain and France. Now it is openly said that the peace that the heads of Belgium and the Netherlands decided to mediate could not be realized because of the answers from Britain and France, hoping to deceive world opinion. It only sees its efforts being unsuccessful. (Havas, 15th)

Belgian Capital Brussels. After German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop rejected the peace proposal of the heads of Belgium and the Netherlands in the name of Führer Hitler, well-informed sources here declared that the German government may not issue a formal note again, but Führer Hitler may send a telegram to the heads of Belgium and the Netherlands in a private capacity to explain the reasons for the rejection. (Havas, 15th)

Amsterdam. According to responsible persons here, the Dutch government will thoroughly study the Dutch-Belgian peace proposal from Germany, carefully examine the current situation, and consult with Belgium. (Haitong Telegraph, 16th)

The Hague. This morning, Dutch newspapers published prominently the news that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had given the German response to the peace proposals of the two Dutch and Belgian heads of state to the envoys of the two countries stationed in Germany. The Dutch newspapers pointed out that Britain and France resolutely rejected the peace proposals, so Germany now also talks about the fact that the mediation business has ended. After receiving the news, the Dutch government contacted the Belgian government to exchange views on the current situation. The New Rotterdam Daily believes that readers should not rush to a conclusion on this matter, because Germany rejected the mediation because Britain and France rejected the peace proposals. If Britain and France explained that they did not mean to reject the proposals abruptly, then Germany might not necessarily fail to consider them. (Haitong Telegraph, 16th)

### Situation Eases at Dutch-Belgian Border

Paris. Informed sources here said that although the tense situation at the border between Germany and Belgium and the Netherlands has eased, the German troops and military equipment concentrated in the border areas in the past week have not been withdrawn. From a purely military point of view, the German army can still launch at any time, and the threat to Belgium and the Netherlands has not diminished. However, Belgium and the Netherlands have taken the necessary precautions, and their defenses have become stronger day by day. At the same time, the French government has also taken the necessary measures in the border area to cope with any German attempts. Although Germany is still ready to give it a try, its current enemies and future enemies have already prepared and rested, and all things that may succeed by chance are absolutely impossible. Therefore, the hope of its success is greatly reduced. In addition, winter is approaching, and if the country wants to launch something at this time, it will be more difficult. (Havas, 16th)

Belgian Capital. All public buses in the city that were requisitioned by the government were returned in full today, and buses on all routes have been running as usual. (Havas Military, 16th)

Amsterdam. The canal between Amsterdam and the North Sea, which was previously closed for night navigation due to the tense situation from Sunday, has now been reopened. This can be seen as another indication that the Netherlands is gradually becoming quieter. (Reuters, 16th)

### Polish Premier Engaged in Activities in England; Talks with British Cabinet Members

London. Since arriving at this inquiry the day before yesterday, General Sikorski, the Prime Minister of Poland, is conducting talks with various members of the British Cabinet. It is reported that the most important issues being discussed are the organization of Polish troops fighting on the Western Front and the relief of Polish refugees. (Havas, 15th)

London. General Sikorski, the Prime Minister of Poland, gave a speech in French at a banquet of the Foreign Correspondents Association here, saying, "From a personal point of view, the current war did not come out of our intentions, and has already transcended the conflict between countries. Whether the principles of law and justice that all mankind should follow can be extended depends on who wins this war. Today, fair observers have felt that all mankind must choose between two different collective lives. One is the way of life expressed by Britain, France, and the United States, and the other can be represented by the horizontal occupation of Austria and Czechoslovakia and the horizontal division of Poland. After my trip to conduct talks with the British authorities, it has been proven that the governments of the two countries have the same views, and their connection is very strong. The Polish army is being reorganized in the territory of Britain and France, and the British and French governments have given great support in spirit and in material. Our team is also cooperating with the strong British fleet. All our sailors are welcomed by their British comrades. It is expected that our land and air forces can fight together with the friendly forces of the Allied countries of Britain and France in a few months. (Havas, 16th)

### Puppet Manchukuo Economy Severely Affected by European War; Soybeans Cannot Be Shipped to Germany; Japan and the Soviet Union Prepare to Negotiate

Changchun. After the outbreak of the European War, the economy of "Manchukuo" has been severely affected. Exports of soybeans and their by-products to Germany have now stopped, and many urgently needed materials taken from Germany are also unable to be obtained. Many factories built to install German machinery are now empty. Industry in the territory is also very lacking, and imports are difficult to resume. The negotiations between Changchun and Tokyo on giving priority to Japanese imported goods being shipped into Manchuria have not been successfully completed. The monopolistic system originally intended to expand "Manchukuo's" export trade has become a pie in the sky. All the warehouses north of Dalian are now piled high with goods, relying solely on Japanese consumption, which is not enough to create a balance of foreign trade. Those with knowledge say that shipping soybeans by rail through Siberia to Germany is nonsense. Leaving aside the amount of freight, the lack of vehicles in "Manchukuo" and the Soviet Union is even more of a problem. As for the idea of refining soybean essence and shipping it to Germany, chemists also believe it is impossible, because the ingredients of soybeans cannot be refined into fine particles, making it economically and commercially suitable for transportation on the Siberian Railway. Therefore, what "Manchukuo" is currently encountering is the difficulty that countries around the world have failed to solve for a hundred years. Agricultural authorities are now planning to change agricultural production so that the territory can be self-sufficient and have a surplus to be exported to other countries in exchange for urgently needed industrial products.

Tokyo. After meeting with Soviet Ambassador Smetanin for 50 minutes yesterday, Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura decided that the agenda of the Chita Conference should be limited to the Nomonhan issue. The Asahi Shimbun said, "The border between 'Manchukuo' and the Soviet Union can be finally demarcated next spring. Negotiations to extend the 1928 Fisheries Agreement for 12 months will also be held soon." (Reuters, 16th)

Tokyo. Japanese Kyushu Daily President Kiyomizu Yoshitaro publicly published a letter yesterday, advocating that Japan should conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, emphasizing that Japan's understanding with the Soviet Union is an absolute prerequisite for realizing its policy towards China. War between Japan and the Soviet Union, or even strained relations, will strengthen the position of Britain and the United States in the Far East. Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov has stated that the Soviet Union is willing to seek understanding with Japan, so the Japanese government should seize the opportunity, actively strive to overthrow the pro-British and pro-Russian traditional principles, and issue a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. If it can be realized, it will not hinder Japan's negotiations with Britain and the United States, but will be enough to make the negotiations easier. (Haitong Telegraph, 16th)

Tokyo. The new Soviet Ambassador, Smetanin, will be received by the Japanese Emperor on November 20 to present his credentials. (Reuters, 16th)

### Pan-American Economic Committee Met Yesterday; Welles Gave a Speech

Washington. The Pan-American Economic Committee met here, and US Undersecretary of State Welles first gave a speech, saying, "We are now starting work in an extremely favorable situation. The determination of the American republics to maintain the security and peace of the Western Hemisphere is known to the world." The task of this committee is to propose appropriate measures to stabilize the business relations of the American countries that have been affected by the European War, and at the same time to always find ways to increase the volume of trade between the American countries. I propose to elect a subcommittee to "discuss ways to develop and facilitate business, improve monetary and financial institutions, promote sound production and investment matters, improve transportation and communication methods, and communicate technical knowledge and experiences from all parties to make the most of them." In addition, I also advocate that the American countries conduct negotiations to discuss bilateral business terms to develop trade, and improve the non-competitive agricultural and industrial products of all parties. All American countries have the possibility of using foreign capital to develop natural resources, and all departments of the United States government should cooperate with other American countries in the most friendly spirit." (Havas, 16th)

### Finance Heavy Selling Resurges, Morning Foreign Exchange Market Again Shows Sharp Decline

Yesterday morning in the foreign exchange market, the opening price announced by HSBC was flat. The black market for British and American currencies, contrary to the quiet of the previous few days, entered a state of tension again. It was at its lowest around noon, reaching a rate of 5 shillings, 4 pence, 6875. However, by closing time, it had recovered slightly to 5 shillings, 2.25 pence. The morning opened relatively stable, but after 9:30 AM, heavy selling suddenly began. It was estimated that Hong Kong Electric, speculators, and outsiders such as Chase National Bank, the Dutch Bank, and Anda Bank eagerly sold off. Furthermore, due to the spread of unfavorable news that German troops had begun to invade the Dutch border from a certain defense line, and that important British military meetings were discussing countermeasures, it was also heard that German merchants, due to the expansion of the European situation, had wired orders to Hong Kong to sell off. As a result, the selling became more intense, and HSBC's appetite for buying became increasingly weak, leading to a breakdown in support. The American exchange rate almost broke the 9 yuan mark, reaching 8.9375 yuan, and the British pound also rose to 5 shillings, 4 pence, 6875. However, the selling soon subsided slightly, and importers, seeing the low prices, quickly and decisively bought in. HSBC's intention to buy was also strong at this time, causing the market to turn around briefly, dropping to 5 shillings, 3.4375 pence and 8.75 yuan. However, the closing price at noon turned softer again. In the afternoon, due to Japanese banks entering the market to buy, and HSBC's appetite for buying remaining strong, the lowest rate recovered to 5 shillings, 2.25 pence and 8.59375 yuan. After hovering around this level, the market soon closed, with the British pound at 5 shillings, 2.96875 pence and the American exchange rate at 8.6875 yuan, slightly firmer by 0.078125 and 0.125 compared to the previous day. It was heard that the trend of futures was the same as that of spot, but the result was slightly squeezed, with the British pound differing by 0.0625 and the American exchange rate differing by 0.125, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of about 1%. Trading throughout the day was active.

American Exchange Rate Almost Breaks the 9 Yuan Barrier

The morning initially opened with London large bars at a recent increase of 0.0625 and a long-term increase of 0.125. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London gold price remained unchanged. The exchange rates for the British pound against the US dollar, Shanghai currency, and the French franc were all flat, with the US dollar against the British pound up 0.375, against the French franc up slightly by 0.125, and against Shanghai currency unchanged. The central bank's posted rates for various currencies remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 5 shillings, 2.1875 pence for the British pound and 8.5625 yuan for the American exchange rate, with no significant change compared to the previous closing prices. The opening was initially stable, but at 9:30 AM, HSBC's announced opening price remained unchanged. After the silver balancing tax was announced, increasing by 0.5%, Hong Kong Electric and local speculators suddenly began heavy selling, and outsiders such as Chase National Bank, the Dutch Bank, and Anda Bank also competed to sell off. In addition, HSBC's appetite for buying was weak, so the market trend became sharply weaker. The British pound rose from 5 shillings, 2.8125 pence to 4.6875 pence, and the American exchange rate also firmed from 8.625 yuan to 9375 yuan. After that, the selling subsided slightly, and foreign firms took advantage of the low prices to buy in. HSBC's appetite for buying was very strong. It was reported that a certain foreign firm bought spot American exchange rate at 8.875 yuan. Subsequently, HSBC absorbed spot British pounds from Hong Kong Electric and speculators from 5 shillings, 4.0625 pence to 3.75 pence, and then it softened to 5 shillings, 3.4375 pence and 8.75 yuan. At noon, HSBC stopped buying and the market firmed again. By the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 5 shillings, 3.75 pence for the British pound and 8.8125 yuan for the American exchange rate, with the British pound weaker by 0.15625 and the American exchange rate cheaper by 0.25 compared to the morning opening.

Japanese Merchants Suddenly Active in the Afternoon Market

In the afternoon market, due to the sudden activity of Japanese banks and HSBC's slight appetite for buying, although Hong Kong Electric continued to sell off, it was still insufficient to meet demand, so the situation turned slightly tighter. HSBC's Japanese bank bought spot British pounds from Hong Kong Electric at 5 shillings, 3.4375 pence and 2.8125 pence. Later, the Japanese bank also purchased spot American exchange rate at 8.75 yuan and 6875 yuan. After the purchase, the British pound softened to 5 shillings, 2.25 pence and 8.59375 yuan. By the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 5 shillings, 2.96875 pence for the British pound and 8.6875 yuan for the American exchange rate, with the December British pound at 5 shillings, 2.34375 pence and the American exchange rate at 8.5625 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, the spot British pound weakened by 0.078125 and the American exchange rate strengthened by 0.125, with the spot British pound cheaper by 0.109375 and the American exchange rate higher by 0.1875 for futures.

### Speculators Emerge En Masse, Gold Market Turns Around After Falling, Lowest at 3,570 Yuan

Yesterday's cash-settled black market conditions for gold were initially strong due to the sudden deterioration of the environment. Later, due to the sharp rise in the exchange rate and the false claims of the shorts, causing those hoping for lower prices to hesitate and sellers to emerge in droves, the market was flooded with chips. The price fell to 3,570 yuan at one point. In the entire process, the exchange market opened flat in the morning, and a certain gold firm, acting on behalf of speculators, raised the price by 10 yuan, reaching a daily high of 3,670 yuan. Subsequently, news that the foreign exchange rate had softened caused the speculators to become discouraged. A certain gold firm, acting on behalf of speculators, emerged, and securities firms also followed suit to sell off. Although a certain money exchange speculator was still actively buying in, the overall supply still exceeded demand, and the price fell to 3,635 yuan. However, at this time, silver shops, acting on behalf of Hong Kong customers, bought in some gold, so the price temporarily rebounded by 15 yuan. Ultimately, due to the continued weakness in foreign exchange, the shorts took the opportunity to stir up trouble, and the securities firms continued to sell off aggressively. The money exchange speculator also reluctantly cut their losses, and the market lacked support, plummeting to a low of 3,570 yuan. By noon, the foreign exchange rate tightened slightly, and money exchange firms bought in at low prices, while those with short positions also quickly took profits, raising the price by 40 yuan to close at 3,610 yuan. In the afternoon, the market weakened again to 3,595 yuan. In the middle, the foreign exchange rate turned tighter, and gold firms suddenly took long positions and bought in, causing the price to rise sharply to 3,645 yuan. However, the closing price fell back to 3,622 yuan, squeezed down by 38 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading throughout the day was active, with about 1,500 taels traded. Jewelry shops reduced their listed prices for gold ornaments by 5 yuan. Customs gold and other gold prices remained flat.

From the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels), the situation was stable due to the price being raised by speculators. The market opened five yuan higher, and the money exchange firm sold 20 taels to a certain Yu firm at 3,665 yuan. Then it rose another five yuan, and a certain gold firm sold 30 taels to the money exchange firm at 3,670 yuan. Subsequently, news that the foreign exchange rate was softening caused a selling spree. A certain gold firm, acting on behalf of speculators, came out to sell, and securities firms also sold off aggressively. Although a certain money exchange firm still had an appetite for buying, it was difficult to counter the selling pressure. The price soon plummeted by 35 yuan, and a certain gold firm sold 30 taels to the money exchange firm for 3,635 yuan. After that, silver shops bought in on behalf of customers, and the market temporarily rebounded, rising by 15 yuan. Silver shops bought 50 taels of cash from gold firms for 3,650 yuan. Later, due to the intensifying weakness of the foreign exchange rate, the selling spree resumed. Securities firms and retail investors competed to sell, and a certain money exchange firm also aggressively sold short, causing the market to plummet again by 80 yuan. A securities firm sold 30 taels to the money exchange firm for 3,570 yuan. At noon, the foreign exchange market softened slightly, and money exchange firms bought in cheaply, causing the market to rebound slightly, rising by 40 yuan. A money exchange firm bought 10 taels from a gold firm for 3,610 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon market initially remained weak. Silver shops first sold 20 taels to the money exchange firm for 3,605 yuan, down by 5 yuan. Later, securities firms also sold off, down another 10 yuan. A securities firm sold 20 taels to the money exchange firm for 3,595 yuan. Subsequently, the foreign exchange market suddenly turned tighter, and a certain gold firm suddenly had an intention to buy, rising by 50 yuan. A securities firm bought 30 taels from a gold firm for 3,645 yuan. After the purchase, the foreign exchange rate stabilized slightly, and the gold firm took profits and sold off, falling by 25 yuan. The gold firm sold 30 taels to the money exchange firm for 3,620 yuan. Later, cash gold firms bought in dozens of taels, raising the price by 5 yuan. A cash gold firm bought 20 taels from a securities firm for 3,625 yuan. Then, the gold firm bought 20 taels from the money exchange firm for 3,622 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price was squeezed down by 38 yuan compared to the previous day. It was found that the price had fallen for five consecutive days, totaling 108 yuan. The price fluctuated by 100 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold firms' own-brand gold was 10 yuan higher for cash settlement, and the buying price was reduced by more than 20 yuan.

### Securities Foreign Stocks Firm and Rise Sharply, Especially

—Domestic Debt Slightly Recovers—

Yesterday's security black market, due to the Japanese army landing in the North Sea, the emptiness of people's hearts was taken advantage of, and the market price fell. Class C shares broke through the 7 yuan mark again. Fortunately, a portion of the speculators maintained a firm grasp, and the downward trend slowed. However, the trend of decline showed no signs of recovery. The future may see another period of fluctuation due to the speculators' wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday morning, Lianyi Sheng bought in large quantities, and Yongkang and Jiufeng sold out, but there were no major transactions, and the market price still tended to weaken slightly. In the afternoon, Lianyi Dafeng had demand, and Hongkang had a slight appetite for buying, but Jiufeng and Tongkang still looked to sell short, so the price still could not rise. As a result, except for Class A shares, which had fallen more sharply the previous day, and therefore recovered by 5 fen, the rest continued to fall by about 1 to 2 jiao. The total number of transactions was estimated to be 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.

In fact, all well-known stocks benefited and rose. In the afternoon, although the stocks were still active, they were soon hit by a wave of profit-taking, and could not extend their gains, as some people imagined that the market had risen too much. However, the underlying trend remained very firm. The rubber quota for the first quarter of the next year has now been decided to be 80%. This has a minimal impact on rubber stocks.

### Yarn Cotton Standing by to Observe, Yarn Market Optimistic but Difficult

The yarn market is sluggish and lifeless, temporarily hovering on the horizontal line, waiting for opportunities to change again. As for general operators, their goals are mostly bullish, because the price of raw cotton is falling unreasonably, and the profit margin of factories is decreasing, so there are quite a few people buying in at low prices. However, the exchange rate is rising step by step, and actual sales are also quiet and show no signs of improvement. The situation is still firming, and it is very expensive to settle down. However, the number of transactions in the market has decreased significantly, and the atmosphere is dull and scattered.

When the yarn market opened in the morning, traders gathered to discuss the rumor that the Japanese army had landed in the North Sea, fearing that it would affect the yarn market. Everyone stood by to observe. Then, those who wanted to make a quick profit first sold 10 bales, with the spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn at 642 yuan, down 6 yuan.

### Yarn Sales Slack, Cotton Market Deteriorates Daily

The number of cotton transactions has decreased, but traders have made some transactions. Cotton seeds are also relatively scarce, and the market is not as lively as it used to be, because the yarn market is slack, the factories' intentions are scattered, and consumption is sluggish. In addition, American cotton prices have also fallen, and the American exchange rate has risen sharply, so the situation is also firm but level. As for Japanese factories, they have no plans to purchase due to the recent decline in the yarn market. 3,958 bales of Subei cotton from Tonghua source and 370 bales of Beisha cotton have arrived. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.

通花 134.00 134.50 135.00 Traders Bought 382 bales

火機 126.00 125.0 又 200 bales

通花 135.25 又 200 bales

常陰沙 129.00 又 200 bales

Another News The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has continued to be unusually quiet in recent days. The exchange rate has also tended to ease, and yarn sales are very sluggish. The factories' intention to purchase is quite weak. Traders have always been interested in purchasing long-fiber American cotton, and have been paying close attention to the price of this cotton in recent days.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices The New York cotton market has been rising for ten days in a row. At the beginning of yesterday's opening, the market was still active, and traders traded a lot, resulting in a slight increase of 2-3 pounds. Later, because the Southern幫 took advantage of the rising trend in the market to sell short, and some speculators also took profits, the closing price was weaker, falling nearly 10 pounds compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose by one rupee. Egypt has been closed for two days. Yesterday's price rose by nearly 40 pounds. Liverpool rose by 2-3 pence.

### Foodstuffs 蘆羊尖 Firm and Active

New Japonica Rice and Kiln Seed Follow the Trend, Afternoon Return Slightly, Transactions in Foreign Rice

粳尖 After the rice market fell once the day before yesterday, the general situation was still weak at the beginning of yesterday's opening due to the remaining momentum from the day before yesterday. Generally, the cargo owners also rarely showed samples, so the early market phenomenon still felt徘徊. Suddenly, in the middle market, locals took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and the market became tighter. The general buyers competed to purchase, and the domestic帮 smoothly handled the second-grade rice, and the market price was uniformly raised by about half a yuan. The supply continued to reach 3,400-3,500 bales of Carrousel brand, while囤戶 did not take action. As a result, although the number of transactions in the entire city was旺, exceeding 10,000 bales, the price of each product only increased by 2-3 jiao. The price of new Japonica rice and Kiln Rice increased by 2-3 jiao because it had been cut through the day before yesterday. Only 蘆羊尖 was sparsely supplied, the stock in the warehouses was weak, and the quality was better than the customer rice, and it was a by-product of Japonica rice, so the shops had a special appetite, so the settled land was solid, and the price continued to rise by 1-2 jiao to 3-4 jiao. The closing market price was 29 yuan, 3 jiao for special 蘆尖, 28 yuan, 7-8 jiao in the middle, 28 yuan, 7 jiao to 28 yuan for special 羊尖, 27 yuan, 7-8 jiao for second-grade, which was similar to the price of ordinary Japonica rice. To the old-new variation yuan, everything belongs to挺秀.

客秈 In the morning market, under the influence of the flood of Japonica rice, the market once fell by 3-4 jiao. Then there was speculative absorption, and it was rumored that the Japanese-run 蕪米 may need to be transported abroad, and cannot be delivered to Shanghai in large quantities. Those who had sold off a month ago will not be able to deliver on schedule, so they repurchased the sold warehouse receipts in the market. Therefore, people's hearts were excited, and the price suddenly rose by nearly a yuan, which was still 5-6 jiao higher than the day before yesterday. However, by the afternoon, it was heard that there was a transaction of foreign rice, and the market and people's hearts fell again. Throughout the day, 3,600 bales of high 蕪秈 were opened at a price of 28 yuan and a half.

洋米 The foreign rice trade, which had been brewing for several days, was officially concluded yesterday. A batch of Saigon No. 1 rice, 2,400 tons, was priced at 30 yuan and 6 jiao per bale, to be loaded from December 8, and delivered to Shanghai Pudong or buoy.

### Oil Market Soybean Oil Rises Sharply

Up Twelve Yuan and Zero Compared to Last Month. There are actually those who want to raise it to eighty yuan.

Since a portion of the soybean oil market has been controlled, and the source is scarce, under the double pressure, the rising momentum has been formidable in the past two days. Compared with the highest price on the same day last month, the market price has risen by more than twelve yuan. What is the reason for such crazy monopoly? Yesterday, the price of barrel oil rose by another three yuan compared with the previous day, and the price of 簍油 rose by two yuan and 5-6 jiao, but only a few buyers took profits and closed their positions, so the number of transactions was not large, because generally, those who hold goods are still looking at the eighty-yuan market. Yesterday,十桶 of Dalian oil was opened (price details in the market price column), 50桶 of Qingdao oil, 400 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 50 pieces of Yanqi oil, 20 pieces of Luhuo oil, 100 pieces of Qingqi oil, 20 pieces of Luhuo oil, and 100担 of oil from this factory.

### Hygiene for Married Life in Early Winter

How many couples in this world unknowingly fall into a miserable hell due to a lack of hygiene! It is a fact that a husband with strong essence and vitality is usually in the dominant position in sexual relations. Although the wife hopes that her husband will always be by her side, she does not always enjoy "that" often. However, when she is at the peak of her passion, she hopes that her husband is strong, virile, and has endurance, so that they can spend their happy life in the harmony of love. This is also the creator's way of rewarding men for improving their health. If a man loses his health due to excessive indulgence and debauchery, he should bear full responsibility. Excessive indulgence and masturbation leading to spermatorrhea are most likely to deplete the reproductive gland fluid, which is the source of our life. Therefore, men who are depleted of essence and vitality are almost certain to suffer from neurasthenia, incomplete development, premature ejaculation, impotence, premature aging, and weak brain and kidney deficiency. At the same time, due to the deficiency and strong desire, it is also most likely to cause impulses in this long winter night, arousing his wife's passion, but often presenting a fleeting pleasure that cannot be satisfied. How can this not cause the wife's hatred? From hatred to the breakdown of feelings, many domestic tragedies such as elopement, divorce, and suicide occur!

If one does not conserve essence in winter, one will inevitably suffer from disease in spring. This is common knowledge that every man should know. In early winter, the weather is like a "little spring." Chrysanthemums and crabs are at their prime, so it is truly time to enjoy life, but one must not be excessive. Unless both husband and wife are filled with passion and have a need to relax their nerves, they should go to bed early and have adequate rest afterward. In short, it is acceptable to cultivate health with love, but it is definitely not appropriate if it damages health. If one already has the above symptoms due to early-year romance, one must seek thorough treatment as soon as possible. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the most effective treatment is to take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Essence). This preparation is made by scientifically replicating the endocrine essence extracted from the reproductive glands of strong animals such as apes, gorillas, and sea dogs, so that the active ingredients are fully preserved. Therefore, this preparation is of high quality, has definite and rapid efficacy, and is unmatched by any similar preparations. After taking it, essence can be produced, kidneys can be nourished, the brain can be strengthened, and blood circulation can be activated within one day and night. It is especially valuable to take it continuously, which will further promote development, nourish nerves, and eradicate various symptoms in a short period. Taking it for a winter will increase body weight and improve health day by day. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people will prolong life, rejuvenate, and return to youth. However, those suffering from spermatorrhea must also take the world-renowned "Ximitu's Jing Solidification Pills" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, which will yield even faster results!

Patient Shen Jiqing, from Hang County, works in a certain bank. He suffered from spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation due to early marriage and accidental injury, as well as occasional forgetfulness and insomnia, which led to a freezing of affection between husband and wife, and difficulty in fulfilling his professional duties! Last month, he came to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment. After learning about his actual condition, I immediately instructed him to purchase two dozens of "Sheng Zhi Su" for men and five boxes of "Ximitu's Jing Solidification Pills" (actual price of two yuan per box) at the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company for combined use, and also administered electrotherapy and injections. After a month and a half, all his ailments have suddenly disappeared, his essence is strong and his strength is sufficient. Not only has the efficiency of his work increased, but the love between husband and wife is also as good as new!

### The Impact of Shriveled Breasts and Remedial Measures

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

In today's era of progress and the omnipotence of science, not only can the defects that people previously thought were hopeless and regrettable for life—such as pockmarks, flat noses, slanted eyes, and cleft lips—be transformed into normal shapes with sophisticated equipment and skilled surgery. Now there is also a special remedy for a pair of breasts, which have been neglected but are even more important than pockmarks, flat noses, slanted eyes, and cleft lips, to make them stand tall. Pockmarks, flat noses, and slanted eyes are certainly unsightly on the outside, but they have little to do with health. However, if a woman's breasts are shriveled, the most precious and lovely curves of a woman cannot be formed. At the same time, it is even more important in terms of health, because a woman's breasts can stand tall entirely because of the active and healthy function of the ovaries. If ovarian function is destroyed by menstrual disorders, leucorrhea, malnutrition, multiple births, and weakness, the breasts will not develop well. Even those who have had good development will gradually shrivel and even become as flat as a man's. Such women should not even think about standing out in social circles. Even in ordinary families, to be honest: (1) it is inevitable that they will be disgusted by their husbands, leading to the misfortune of frequenting prostitutes and taking concubines. (2) Childbirth is difficult, and it is even more difficult to avoid the sigh of having no descendants! (3) Health and beauty are lost, and there are many illnesses and pains. (4) Due to the lack of offspring, even if there are millions of family assets, they can only be handed over to others. All of the above are facts that are commonly seen and heard by the general public, and are not the author's nonsense.

As for the remedial measures mentioned by the author, women only need to have strong confidence and go to the pharmacy to purchase "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Essence) for women, taking three tablets three times a day. After about four weeks of taking it, the appetite will definitely increase, the spirit will be refreshed, and the muscles will gradually become plump. Continue to take it for four or five weeks, the mind will be clear, the blood will be abundant, and the breasts will gradually rise. At this time, the effect is already extremely obvious, but this medicine has a peaceful nature and no side effects, so it should be taken continuously to ensure a rosy complexion, smooth muscles, and lasting youth.

### The Pathology and Treatment of Spermatorrhea

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

From childhood to adulthood, the reproductive function gradually matures, which is an omen of the youth's future and happiness! If one does not cherish oneself, or is blinded by curiosity and the temptation of a bad environment, and commits masturbation and homosexual love, or early marriage and indulgence, destroying the sexual nerves and loosening the sperm gate, spermatorrhea will inevitably break out. Therefore, those who suffer from spermatorrhea are almost certain to have neurasthenia. In this early winter, the weather is not yet cold, but they already have cold hands and feet and a listless spirit. If spermatorrhea is not treated for a long time, the sperm gate will become increasingly loose, and the frequency of leakage will gradually increase. Many young people suffer from terrible spermatorrhea and sperm leakage due to the lack of treatment for mild nocturnal emission. Semen is the source of our life. Continuing to lose a large amount of it will inevitably lead to essence depletion and blood depletion, and all kinds of diseases will arise, such as mental weakness, poor memory, dizziness, disturbed dreams and insomnia, sore back and aching waist, kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, and incomplete development. Most of these young people are pale and thin, or outwardly strong but inwardly empty, and their energy is depleted. If they are students in school, their academic performance will inevitably fall behind others. Those who are engaged in business will feel that they cannot cope with the difficulties! At the same time, because of their unattractive appearance, they are often abandoned by the opposite sex and fall into a miserable state of unrequited love. Even in married life, it is difficult to have conjugal bliss, and all kinds of tragedies are constantly staged in the family! Or they age prematurely and die young!

The misery of spermatorrhea after neglect is well known. Therefore, early treatment is the best policy. The only way to treat it is to quickly take the holy medicine for treating spermatorrhea, "Ximitu's Jing Solidification Pills", to strengthen the sperm gate and calm the nerves, which will have the special effects of promoting sleep and stopping spermatorrhea that night. If you already have the above symptoms due to spermatorrhea and indulgence, you must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" made from strong animals to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continuous use will further promote development, adjust metabolic function, and eradicate various symptoms in a short period. Taking it for a winter can increase body weight, prolong life, and promote longevity. If patients can come to this clinic in person to use electrotherapy and injections, we can guarantee a cure.

### Japan's War in China: Already in a Difficult Situation, Utterly Submissive to the Soviet Union and the United States, Still Hesitant About Ending the War - Important Remarks by Suma

After the newly appointed Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Yakichiro Suma, arrived in Shanghai, he held a special press conference at the Broadway Mansions on the afternoon of the previous day, inviting foreign journalists to answer various questions raised. Suma first stated, "I have been away from the Far East for a long time, and my visit to China this time is to see and hear about the 'New Order in East Asia.'" In response to reporters' inquiries, he said, "Regarding the idea of how to resolve the Sino-Japanese war, the theory of dividing China's spheres of influence between the Soviet Union and Japan is the most ridiculous." When a reporter asked, "Then what is the best option?" he replied, "The best option is to implement the intentions of the statement made by former Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe on December 22, 1938."

Soviet-Japanese Pending Issues: Urgent Need for Resolution

When asked, "What efforts will Japan make to improve Soviet-Japanese relations and form a treaty of non-aggression between the two countries?" he replied, "There are no specific steps yet, so there are no preconditions for the Soviet Union and Japan to conclude a treaty." Regarding Soviet-Japanese relations, Suma said, "There are currently some outstanding issues between the two countries that need to be resolved. Tokyo believes that each issue should be resolved step by step, and finally the relations between the two countries can be adjusted." When a reporter asked, "In the current Soviet-Japanese negotiations, is the issue of Soviet aid to China one of the main points?" he replied, "The main outstanding issues in the negotiations are fishing rights, border issues, etc. The discussion of these issues and political disputes are not incorporated into the intentions of the Japanese government." When a reporter asked, "Many people believe that the Soviet government and the Third International are one and the same. Can Japan launch an anti-communist movement while simultaneously concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union?" Suma avoided answering directly, saying, "I did not say that Japan will conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. Japan's policy has not changed."

How to End the Sino-Japanese War

Although Suma said that the best way to resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict is to realize Konoe's statement, he failed to clearly state Japan's ultimate determination to withdraw its troops from China, saying, "This depends on future developments and circumstances." Regarding the "New Central Government," Suma said, "There are no accurate reports, as the official establishment date has not been determined. Although there have been news of dates from Tokyo, it is only based on individual perspectives. The reason for the delay in establishment is not due to insufficient preparation of affairs, or because it is not easy to establish, or because it has encountered some obstacles and become deadlocked. The Japanese government is still continuing its established policy to achieve its goals." When a reporter asked, "In your speech, the final withdrawal of Japanese troops from China depends on future developments. Does this mean that Wang Jingwei cannot guarantee to the Chinese people that he can achieve the withdrawal of Japanese troops?" Suma was speechless and only said, "Japan's policy is only based on Konoe's statement. As for what Mr. Wang does or what other parties do, it is none of our concern and should not be stated by Japanese officials." When a reporter asked, "Mr. Wang stated on November 12 of this year that he will seek absolute freedom and independence for China. If there is no way, then he will have to fight to the end. What is your opinion?" Suma considered this question and decided not to answer, saying, "I do not want to discuss any statements from the Chinese side at the moment, including Wang's claims." However, when asked whether "Tokyo is willing to negotiate directly with the National Government or through the mediation of a third country," Suma's answer was affirmative, saying, "There is no such intention at all." When a reporter asked, "Is Japan only supporting Wang Jingwei?" Suma replied, "Japan's support is not limited to any one person, but depends on the claims of their 'regime.' All claims that are in line with Japan's interests will receive broad support."

Japan Exhausted, Submissive to the United States

The discussion then turned to the issue of US-Japan relations. Suma stated, "I have just returned from the United States, so I feel that I know a lot about the United States. I feel that the US government and people, from top to bottom, have never hoped for a deterioration in US-Japan relations, so I believe that US-Japan relations will definitely improve. After returning to my country, this hope has increased even more, because I see that the Japanese government and the Japanese people are eagerly hoping to obtain the understanding of the United States. Although the 594 cases of US protests against Japan have not yet been resolved, Japan should strive to satisfy the United States and resolve them. However, Japan's use of troops in China has reached a very large degree. Under this situation, seeking to resolve the pending issues with the United States will naturally take time. However, Japan's efforts and goodwill will be seen one day." When a reporter asked, "Is it possible for a new US-Japan commercial treaty to be completed before January next year?" Suma admitted that the Japanese government is eager for the conclusion of a new commercial treaty, and said, "If the United States is unwilling to sign a new commercial treaty with Japan, the affected parties will not only be Japan, but the United States will also feel inconvenienced. The Americans should believe this." When a reporter asked, "Can the so-called 'New Order in East Asia' make the United States feel that it does not conflict with its government?" he replied, "American newspapers and magazines have expressed various opinions on this, but the American government and people may not all be die-hards who oppose the 'New Order.' "The US government has made it clear that it is not blind to the progress of the world, and since the entire world, including East Asia, is in turmoil, I believe that the United States does not want to run counter to the progress of the situation and remain in a stage of blindness."

### Japanese Troops in Western Zhejiang Suffer Defeat on Two Routes, Fierce Battles in Chang'an and Xiashi, Japanese Flee to Linghu and Qianjin Market, Shuanglin Recaptured

Jinhua, 15th – On the evening of the 11th, Chinese troops attacked the Japanese troops stationed in Heshan and Shanlian, northeast of Deqing. On the morning of the 12th, they drove away the Japanese troops in Wuhe and Jing, and took advantage of the victory to launch a fierce attack on Shiwan. They continued to recapture Shuanglin. Also, Chongqing, 15th – Chinese troops in western Zhejiang adopted a comprehensive tactic, inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese troops. Chinese troops in the Chongde, Wuxing, and Tongxiang areas, after encircling the Japanese troops from the night of the 9th, engaged in fierce battles in Lutou, northwest of Tongxiang, Wuzhen, Puxian, Tongxiang, Xinshi, northwest of Jiaxing, and along the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway in Chang'an and Xiashi. After being pressured by the Chinese troops, the Japanese troops fled in different directions. More than 40 Japanese troops, transported by civilian boats and motorboats, fled to Linghu (part of Wuxing). Another group of 50 Japanese troops, transported by motorboats and civilian boats from Xinshi, fled to Qianjin Market. The Chinese troops are pursuing them.

### Japanese Troops Invading Danyang Completely Annihilated, New Fourth Army Fights Fiercely Southwest of Danyang, Killing More Than 270 Japanese Soldiers, Japan Acknowledges Active Chinese Troops in the Lower Yangtze River

In order to cooperate with the new anti-Japanese situation after the great victory of the Chinese troops in northern Hunan, the New Fourth Army and the Jiangnan Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, which are densely concentrated behind the Japanese troops along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, are constantly carrying out guerrilla tactics of ambushes and flank attacks. As a result, the scope of activities of the Japanese troops in the occupied areas has been shrinking day by day, and they are suffering greatly. According to visitors from Danyang, on the morning of the 8th of this month, more than 100 Japanese soldiers, carrying light military weapons, invaded Yanling Town (40 li southwest of Danyang) from Baoyan (27 li south of Danyang) with great fanfare.

Fierce Fighting, Japanese Ultimately Encircled

After receiving intelligence reports, the X Battalion of the First Regiment and Commander Wang of the Second Regiment of the New Fourth Army personally led the X Battalion to make strict arrangements to gather the troops in Jiuli Town and Majia Village, west of Yanling, forming a strong encirclement. A fierce battle immediately broke out with the Japanese troops. The sound of gunfire and artillery shook dozens of li. Because the New Fourth Army received the assistance of the people, accurate intelligence, familiarity with and advantage of the terrain, and the destruction of transportation on roads around, the Japanese troops could not be reinforced in a continuous stream. In addition, with rich combat experience (the army has experienced more than 300 battles of all sizes), a clear understanding of the anti-Japanese war, and a hundredfold courage, everyone fought bravely, with one person acting as ten, and charged valiantly. Although the Japanese troops relied on sophisticated weapons, most of them were eventually annihilated.

Japanese Completely Annihilated in One Day and One Night

Subsequently, more than 200 Japanese soldiers from Danyang and Baitu Town came to reinforce. The X Battalion of the Second Regiment of the New Fourth Army also rushed to the scene, and a fierce battle, rarely seen in Jiangnan in the past two years, unfolded. The battle started on the morning of the 8th and lasted until the morning of the 9th, a total of 28 hours. As a result, all the Japanese troops were annihilated, with more than 270 killed, dozens wounded, six light and heavy machine guns captured, three grenade launchers, more than 160 rifles, three Japanese soldiers captured, and countless other military supplies. In this battle, the army also heroically sacrificed 50 or 60 people and wounded 40 or 50 people. This battle can be described as a remarkable feat of the army on the Jiangnan battlefield.

Fujita Acknowledges Active Chinese Troops

According to Japanese sources yesterday, Lieutenant General Fujita, the newly appointed commander of the Shanghai area, gave a speech to a group of foreign journalists on the 15th, acknowledging the activity of the Chinese troops, making it impossible to establish "security." Fujita said that the lower Yangtze River area is the most important place for politics, economy, and military affairs in central China, and the establishment of "security" there is the most urgent task. However, there are still regular Chinese troops and guerrilla units that launch attacks from time to time, disrupting "security." Therefore, the Japanese army intends to exert all its efforts to "eliminate" these troops in order to establish "security." However, the Chinese side firmly believes that this kind of attempt by the Japanese side will ultimately be futile.

### Japanese Troops on North Jiangxi Road Suddenly Intensify Inspection

Those Blocked Numbered 70 to 80, The Exit Seems to Be More Relaxed.

At the two gaps on North Jiangxi Road, the intersection of Wenjian Shi Road and Haining Road, the Japanese troops guarding the posts suddenly paid special attention to pedestrians entering on the afternoon of yesterday. In addition to taking the passes and verifying the photos and ages one by one, they also observed whether the state and clothing were different or consistent. If the photos were not recent, or the clothing in the photos did not match what was worn, they were considered suspicious, and the passes were immediately torn up. As a result, as many as seventy or eighty pedestrians were blocked for no reason. The tension was unprecedented. However, the two gaps seemed to be more relaxed.

### British Residents in China Hold Fundraising Meeting

British residents in China, after the outbreak of the European war, organized the "Central War Fundraising Association" and carried out fundraising separately to provide wartime funds. It is learned that the association will hold a meeting next Tuesday at the British Women's Association at No. 12 The Bund. Arnold will be the chairman of the meeting. At that time, Mr. Arnold will speak about the meaning of "Raising the Standard" in the radio broadcast of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. On the one hand, Mr. Arnold hopes to raise more donations and discuss recent events.

### Japanese Troops Land in Beihai, Shanghai Ships Temporarily Do Not Call, Taikoo Jinan Wheel Sailed South Yesterday and Was Implemented, South China Route Encountered Another Major Blow

Since the fall of Guangzhou, various shipping companies have opened up a new route for coastal defense in Guangzhou Bay. According to the prescribed route, the ships travel from Shanghai via Hong Kong to Guangzhou Bay to Haiphong, and also call at Beihai Haikou. Yesterday, the city of Shanghai received news that Japanese troops landed on a small island in Beihai the day before yesterday (the 15th) at dawn. Therefore, calling at Beihai has been temporarily suspended. The Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel, which left the port at 1 pm yesterday, has implemented not calling at Beihai. Therefore, the South China route has suffered another blow.

### False Police Shoot at British Automobile, Foreigners Express Deep Resentment, British Consulate Will Protest to False Municipal Government, Number of False Police Who Fired Also Ascertained

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," the British Consulate General will protest to "Mayor Chuan Xiaolan" regarding the fact that a British person was driving a car through the intersection of Difeng Road and Daxilu Road last night, and was allegedly shot at once by a policeman of the "Special Municipal Government" "on traffic duty" because he ignored the signal issued. The foreign community in the city is quite resentful of this shooting case. A large number of armed police officers on the road are already trying to seize the activities of the Public Security Bureau of the Public Concession on the roads and sidewalks outside the concession. Now, driving to that area feels unsafe.

Name of British Person Not Yet Announced

The name of the British person has not been announced. He was driving a car along Difeng Road last night and drove past a policeman on the road wearing a black winter uniform. When the car passed the intersection, a shot was heard and the bullet flew past the car. The British person accelerated away. The shooter seemed to be standing on the sidewalk rather than the "police officer on traffic duty." Later, someone asked the police why he fired. He replied, "Because the person in the car saw the police signal and did not stop the car."

British Military Authorities Demand Explanation

According to the Continental Daily, a British person was driving a car from Difeng Road into Maggie Road yesterday (15th) night, and was shot at by a false policeman because he did not see the traffic signal from the "Special Municipal Government" police. The name of the British person was not disclosed last night. The Jing'an Temple Police Station did not receive any news about this matter, but the British military authorities have notified the "Special Municipal Government Police Bureau" to demand an explanation.

Did Not See Signal, Suddenly Heard Gunshot

The British person was driving south along Difeng Road from the north. Near Daxilu Road, he slowed down and continued to drive forward when a policeman from the "Special Municipal Government" did not make a traffic signal gesture. As soon as the car passed the intersection of Haig Road and entered Maggie Road, a gunshot was suddenly heard, and the bullet flew past the car, luckily missing. He continued to drive forward and reported to the British Military Headquarters.

British Consulate Protest to Be Filed Today

Last night's final news was that the British Consulate was waiting for a detailed report from the Bureau of Public Works regarding the shooting of British residents by false police the night before and could file a protest with the false mayor by this afternoon at the latest. It was also learned that the British military's question to the false police bureau had not been answered as of last night, but the British military had ascertained the number of the false police officer who fired the shot and had notified the false police bureau. The name of the British resident who was attacked will not be released to avoid accidents, but it is known that he is a member of the Shanghai International Volunteer Corps.

### Street Children Being Sheltered

Many Are War Orphans

The Shanghai Municipal Council is now making every effort to arrange for street children. According to the police department, in October, 34 vagrant children who lingered on the streets and children who specialized in opening car doors to solicit rewards were taken in by the police. Most of these children have been living on the streets for two years, sleeping in the open, which is very miserable. Most of them are orphaned children after the "August 13th" battle, alone and begging. The Municipal Council has already been aware of this, so it recently established a street children's shelter at No. 190 Ningbo Road to accommodate these orphaned beggars. There are now 50 beggars in the shelter. Therefore, the beggar children who used to be found opening car doors and soliciting rewards from passengers at various wharves and streets are no longer found now.

### Fujita Shows Inner Distress to Foreign Journalists, Unwilling to Offend Soviet Union and United States, Difficult to Say When Sino-Japanese War Will End

—Opening Up the Interior Is Also Lip Service and Not Substantial—

According to the North China Daily News, Lieutenant General Fujita, commander of the Japanese army in the Shanghai area, stated at a reception for foreign journalists at his official residence in Jiangwan yesterday (15th) afternoon that the Japanese army would avoid meaningless conflicts with the Soviet Union as much as possible in order to contribute to world peace. He earnestly hoped that after a reasonable and understanding approach was achieved to resolve the long-standing issues between the United States and Japan, relations between the two countries would greatly improve. As for the revocation of restrictions on trade and travel in the interior by people of third countries, he could not give any definite guarantees. The issue of allowing unrestricted residence in Nanshi is currently under serious study by the Japanese military authorities.

Opening Up the Interior Is Hopeless

Fujita replied to a large number of written questions submitted by reporters in advance, expressing his opinion that the military equipment and other war materials supplied by Europe to Chongqing have certainly decreased due to the outbreak in Europe. Fujita also assured reporters that within the possible scope of military needs, restrictions on trade and travel in the interior by foreigners will be gradually eased. However, this easing must not hinder military operations. He could not say when the easing would be implemented, as this point depends on the deployment of the Japanese army and the situation in the enemy's camp.

Difficult to Predict Future of War Against China

When asked how extensive the activities of the guerrillas in the Yangtze River basin and near Nanjing were, Fujita replied that the Japanese troops occupying these areas had repeatedly contacted the guerrillas, but the guerrillas are now gradually ineffective. After the recruitment period, peace and order will be restored. Because there are wars on both sides, travelers are quite dangerous, so restrictions on travel and commerce in these areas are unavoidable. He could not say how long the Sino-Japanese war would last. Whether Japan has continued military objectives in China depends entirely on future circumstances.

Japanese in China Are of Uneven Quality

US-Japan relations have improved slightly. If both sides have a thorough discussion of the pending issues, he believes that the differences that still exist can be resolved, and the relations between the two countries can have a clearer atmosphere. Before Fujita got up, he also discussed various issues related to China and Japan with the reporters. He asked how many of the reporters present had lived in Japan, and then asked if, in their opinion, Japanese people were unpleasant people. One reporter replied that Japanese people in Japan were indeed like that, but many Japanese people in China were not. Fujita laughed when he heard this, saying that unfortunately, the Japanese people in China are of uneven quality.

### British East Surrey Regiment to Be Transferred to Tianjin

Rumor That West Yorkshire Regiment Will Be Transferred Elsewhere, British Military Authorities Could Not Confirm

Regarding the rumor that the British East Surrey Regiment stationed in Shanghai will be transferred to Tianjin to replace the shortage of the Douhan Light Tank Regiment, the British military authorities in this port said that this point "does not seem ripe yet." According to reports, a team of the East Surrey Regiment has been ordered to be transferred to Tianjin to protect overseas Chinese, which is indeed true. The order to transfer the East Surrey Regiment of the Shanghai British Army to Tianjin to protect British interests and withdraw the soldiers of the Douhan Light Tank Regiment was issued by London, the British capital. Since the Douhan Light Tank Regiment withdrew to Hong Kong, it seems somewhat inappropriate to leave a small number of troops in North China, so it is quite reasonable to transfer a team of the East Surrey Regiment to Tianjin. Moreover, since Britain participated in the war, any army, regardless of which army, must comply with the order and be transferred within a few hours of the order being received. It is possible for the troops to not meet each other for several months or even years. The rumor that the West Yorkshire Highland Regiment will also be transferred elsewhere soon, the British military authorities cannot yet confirm. It is heard that this measure by the British side, according to the explanation, is due to the outbreak of the European War, but China has concerns about Britain's Far East policy.

### Zhuang Songfu Celebrates His Eightieth Birthday

Wang Rutang and Others Initiate Congratulations, Preparations Office Established in Shanghai

Mr. Zhuang Songfu from Fenghua has successively held important positions such as member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, member of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government, and acting chairman of the Huai River Guidance Committee. He is frugal in his clothing and diet, and his enthusiasm and determination have made his political achievements remarkable. He is highly respected by people from both the government and the opposition. In recent years, he has retired to his hometown, focusing on farmland water conservancy. This year, December 26th is Mr. Zhuang's eightieth birthday. Mr. Wang Rutang, Chu Huiseng, Yu Feipeng, Chen Yihuai and other contemporary worthies believe that Mr. Zhuang is an elder with great virtue and has made contributions to the party and the country. In the past, when he was in his hometown, he destroyed his family for the sake of learning. In Shanghai, he presided over new learning associations, edited agricultural books, and organized large-scale forestry and animal husbandry companies in Yuhang and Lin'an to promote reclamation, achieving remarkable results. He has foresight and is diligent in his work, and can be a role model for future generations. Therefore, they established the Zhuang Birthday Preparations Office at the China Agricultural Bookstore on Jiaotong Road in this port, and widely solicited poems and articles to express congratulations and show appreciation.

### Zhejiang Province Establishes Oil Collection Network for Tung Oil Purchases

Province Divided into Three Regions, Oil Stations Established at Key Points

Zhejiang Province's purchase of tung oil was previously contracted by the provincial government with the Central Trust Bureau, and the Oil Tea Cotton Silk Management Office was entrusted to undertake the work. The purchase started on October 11. In order to facilitate the sale of oil by farmers and merchants, a province-wide oil collection network has been established. Except for the counties in the war zone, the oil-producing areas in eastern Zhejiang are divided into three regions: Jinquyan, Ningshaotai, and Wenchu. Within each region, oil collection stations are established at key points according to the production and transportation conditions to directly purchase oil. For counties with a large amount of oil production but without oil collection stations, the oil collection stations entrust local banks, cooperative treasuries, trading shops, and cooperatives to purchase oil at appropriate locations. Counties without the above institutions may entrust registered and qualified oil dealers to purchase on their behalf. The price of oil is uniformly set at 50 yuan per market dan (100 catties). Oil-filled tin containers are subsidized at 1 yuan per market dan, for a total of 51 yuan. The Zhejiang Provincial Government also promulgated a provisional outline of measures for the control and transportation of tung oil and ordered it to be followed.

### To Ship Goods to Malaya, Local Customs Must Be Registered, Restrictions on 34 Kinds of Goods Are a Controlled Policy, Non-Sterling Group Goods Must Be Approved

Since the Malayan government promulgated measures to restrict the import of 34 kinds of goods this year, various domestic goods factories in this city, due to their failure to fully understand the reasons for this, have successively written to the Shanghai General Federation of Chinese Industries, requesting the association to inquire on their behalf. The association, considering that the matter concerned the entire issue of domestic goods, forwarded the letter to Mr. Gao Shiheng, the overseas domestic goods inspection representative, requesting him to investigate the matter clearly and reply to relieve the public's doubts. Now Mr. Gao has replied in a letter, saying that after the Malayan government announced the restriction on the import of 34 kinds of goods, its purpose was to control foreign exchange and prevent the flight of funds. Any country outside the Sterling Group that wants to import these 34 kinds of goods must first request registration with the local customs. Only after approval can the goods be allowed to be imported. At present, these application procedures are not difficult, but just require one more procedure. Importers here have pre-processed these procedures for goods shipped from Shanghai before importing them. As for future changes, it is difficult to predict. All countries are now paying attention to control work, and regardless of the import and export of foreign exchange and goods, they are building barriers. We should pay attention to this.

### Lun Chang Factory Authorities Make Final Efforts

Labor Negotiations Interrupted Again

Factory Still Plans to Find a Solution

More than 2,800 workers in the Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Pudong, which is owned by British merchants, have been on strike for half a year since being instigated. Last week, the negotiations between the two sides were very close, and the factory had repaired and refurbished the internal buildings and machinery, and also transported in a large amount of raw materials to facilitate resumption of work. Unexpectedly, the recent negotiations have been interrupted again. Although it is not a complete break, there is no progress and it has fallen into a standstill. The reason is that a certain party needs to recover several times the 100,000 yuan relief funds and various publicity expenses spent on the workers during this half year strike from the factory. This is the focus of the suspension of negotiations. It is heard that the factory plans to make a final effort to resolve the six-month strike in order to help the workers, whose lives have become more difficult with the arrival of this winter, and to avoid both sides suffering huge losses again.

### Readjustment of Shipping on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line; Shorter Voyage

Loading Cargo Between Shanghai and Shipu

Carrying Passengers Between Shanghai and Zhenhai

Regarding the issue of shortening the shipping route and voyage of the Shanghai-Ningbo line, although it was previously planned that the Fook Line would be the first to try a method where passengers going to Ningbo from Shanghai would be transferred, and cargo would not be transferred temporarily. The ship would then carry passengers back to Shanghai and then a second time to Zhenhai, which would save unnecessary time waiting to unload cargo outside the port, and provide more convenience for passengers traveling back and forth. However, this plan was ultimately opposed by other shipping companies and could not be realized.

The Hanna Line Only Carries Passengers Between Shanghai and Zhenhai

Recently, the Hanna Line has been approved by the Ningbo Garrison Command to call at Shipu on the way to Zhenhai. According to the shipping company's plan, cargo will be loaded between Shanghai and Shipu, and passengers will be carried between Shanghai and Zhenhai. Since loading and unloading cargo at Shipu does not require waiting time, and passengers can be unloaded at Zhenhai as soon as they arrive, the voyage can definitely be shortened, and the number of trips can also be increased. If the ship implements the above plan, other ships will also follow suit. At that time, the round trip journey is expected to be adjusted.

Resolution of Disputes at Loading and Unloading Docks

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, disputes and even fights have occurred between Ningbo junk (sailboat) loading and unloading workers and dock workers over the right to load and unload cargo from the Fook and De Ping ships, which has affected the unloading work of these ships. It is now known that the dispute has been resolved satisfactorily after a meeting convened by the Yin County government with all relevant parties.

### French Postal Administration Prohibits the Import of Trade Parcels

Albania and Italy

Various Currencies Prohibited from Entering. The Shanghai Postal Administration issued two notices yesterday: (1) Notice No. 1586 stated that the Albanian postal administration had sent a letter stating that "all Albanian and Italian banknotes or cash sent by mail to Albania are prohibited. Also, all bank drafts, various checks, allocations, and other valuable documents, as well as savings books, treasury bills, stocks, and their coupons, issued in Albanian francs or Italian currency, must be accompanied by a permit from the National Bank of Albania to be allowed entry; otherwise, the mail will be detained and subject to legal sanctions. Accordingly, please investigate." (2) Notice No. 1587 stated that the French postal administration had sent a telegram stating that "except for parcels containing gold and personal items sent from individual to individual that do not have a commercial nature, all other items may not be sent to France by parcel post. Also, sending multiple parcels from the same sender to the same recipient is prohibited. Accordingly, please investigate."

### Mr. Yu Qiaqing Talks About the Truth of Coal Briquette Price Drop

Da Mao Coal Briquette Factory is Purely Operated by Chinese Merchants

The Purpose is to Stabilize Market Prices for the Benefit of the Common People

Regarding the recent drop in coal briquette prices in this city, Mr. Yu Qiaqing told a Daguan News Agency reporter yesterday that coal briquettes are an important fuel for residents of this city, and are particularly closely related to the interests of the lower and middle classes. A few months ago, coal prices soared. Anthracite coal is used by factories and ships, and white coal is needed by middle and upper class families to ward off the cold, so the impact is relatively light. However, coal briquettes are a necessity of daily life and have the same nature as rice. The price increase to four yuan and five jiao per dan (equivalent to ten yuan per ton) has become unbearable for the people. He consulted with coal merchant Mr. Zhang and others to set up a factory. The factory is located at the original site of the Jardine Matheson sugar godown in Pudong. Moreover, it is well known to people in the coal industry that the white coal dust used to make coal briquettes is not a Japanese product. Furthermore, the raw materials used by the factory are entirely shipped from French Annam to Shanghai, which is also a fact. After the factory was established, prices immediately dropped, reducing the burden on ordinary people. The current market price of coal briquettes has been stabilized at sixty-three yuan per ton and three yuan and five jiao per dan, which greatly benefits the livelihood of the common people. The rumor that the products of the Da Mao factory are Japanese coal briquettes is likely due to jealousy from competitors. This report aims to clarify the truth and distinguish between right and wrong.

### Owner of Garden Villa at Avenue Joffre Sues for Eviction; Owner Appeals to the High Court, Retrial Yesterday

A large garden villa at 1877 Avenue Joffre is the property of Tao Huayu Fang, the wife of Tao Jiayao, the former governor of Jiangxi Province, the former head of the National Water Conservancy, and the current chairman of the China Funeral Home, who is from Jiangxi. The Tao family used to live there. During the August 13th Incident, the entire Tao family moved to 6 Lane 753 Haig Road. After the war broke out, the property was entrusted to the Tong An Company for rent. In October of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the Central Mint rented the house from the Tong An Company to use as an office location at a monthly rent of four hundred yuan. At that time, both parties

Signed a lease agreement

But stipulated that the shortest period was three months. Around October of last year, Mrs. Tao sold the villa to a Westerner named Qiaoqi (transliteration), and at the same time terminated the lease with the Central Mint, ordering them to move out. Because the Central Mint refused to move out, the Tao family could not hand over the house to Qiaoqi according to the sales contract, so the Tao family compensated Qiaoqi one thousand five hundred yuan and cancelled the house sale contract. The lease

Term expired

The landlord, Accountant Dali, refused to continue the lease. The Tao family urgently needed to move, and again ordered the Central Mint to move out so that they could take back the house for their own residence. As a result, due to the Central Mint's opposition, in April of this year, Tao Huayu Fang, the wife of Tao Jiayao, the owner of the villa, came forward and appointed lawyers Li Guozhen and Li Yujun to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Civil Division against Tan Songtao, the legal representative of the Central Mint.

Seeking eviction

And compensation for damages of one thousand five hundred yuan. Judge Dong Zi Guan opened the court for trial. The defendant, Tan Songtao from the Central Mint, was represented by lawyer Ma Shouhua. The defendant argued that they had rented the house from the Tong An Company, and the subject of the lawsuit was inconsistent. The plaintiff first sold the house and then wanted to take it back for their own residence, so the objectives were inconsistent, opposing the eviction. The plaintiff's

House sale dispute

Resulted in compensation of one thousand five hundred yuan for breach of contract, which the defendant should not be responsible for. The three-month lease term stipulated in the contract had already passed, so the lease was indefinite. The defendant should have the benefit of the lease, and the plaintiff's request for eviction was unreasonable. As a result, the first instance judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim. Tao Huayu Fang was not satisfied and appealed to the Civil Division of the Third High Court. The result was rejected. She then appealed to the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court for a third trial. The Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court has now reviewed the entire case file and ruled that the portion of the appeal concerning compensation for damages is rejected, and the appeal for the eviction portion is remanded to the Third High Court

For retrial

The Third High Court received the judgment and case file. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xia Jinde, accompanied by Judge Tong, opened the court for trial. Both the appellant and the appellee were represented by lawyers. Both sides made their arguments, each with sufficient reasons. The court then questioned the appellant Tao Huayu Fang in detail about whether she was the spouse of Tao Jiayao, and announced that they would

Set a date for witnesses and continue the debate.

### Japanese Military Forbids Foreigners From Hunting in the Suburbs, Saying it is Easy to be Mistaken for Guerrilla Attacks

Foreigners carrying hunting rifles and hunting in the suburbs of Shanghai have recently been strictly prohibited by the Japanese military. The notification issued by the Japanese military authorities was released at yesterday's press briefing. It was stated that Japanese sentries in the suburbs of Shanghai had repeatedly heard the sound of gunfire and mistakenly believed that guerrillas were attacking, issuing false alarms. For this reason, the Japanese military authorities will not be responsible for any accidents caused by third-country nationals carrying guns and hunting in the suburbs of Shanghai in the future.

### Major Robbery Case at Xiangtai Lumber Company; All the Robbers Apprehended; Pre-hired Truck Robbed a Large Amount of Lead Ingots; Stolen Goods and Truck Discovered; Car Owner, Driver, and Robbers Arrested Together

At approximately 9 PM on the night of the 9th of this month, more than ten robbers, each armed with guns, broke into the Xiangtai Lumber Company at 15 May-Beig Road one after another, bound and monitored the watchman Zhou Caisheng and other employees. They then began to search and rob the employees, stealing 695 yuan in cash and obtaining various keys from Zhou Caisheng. They then followed a

Prearranged plan

And opened the side door of the Xiangtai Lumber Company on Jing'an Temple Road. A truck drove in and loaded fifty-four lead ingots (each weighing two hundred pounds), worth seven thousand five hundred and sixty-seven yuan, onto the truck and sped away. When the Xin Zha Public Security Bureau received the report, they immediately ordered a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. However, the robbers had already escaped. The police believed that the robbery was premeditated and dared to pre-hire a truck

To commit robbery in broad daylight, so they conducted a detailed investigation. According to Hua constable number 2928, who was stationed at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Ma Huo Road to direct traffic, he had seen a truck cross the road. Because trucks are not allowed to drive on Jing'an Temple Road according to regulations, he paid attention and saw that the license plate number was 23155. However, because there was nothing in the truck, he did not stop it. The police then used this information to determine that the truck belonged to the Da Hua Transportation Company at 41 Fujian Road.

Ordered detectives to investigate

According to people in the company, the truck was out on a mission, so there were no results. Until 10 AM on the 15th, Xin Zha Public Security Bureau Hua detective leader Ding Huaguo, detectives Li Yinmin, Chen Jinsheng, Ma Derong, Yang Feizhang, etc., learned that the gang of robbers were hiding in room 7 of the Wuzhou Hotel at 517 Lane 5, Ma Road. They then cooperated with foreign detective Shala and secretly went to the address, successively arresting Jiang Yuting (also known as Da Mugua), Ma Fugen, Zhang Xinzao (also known as Shazi), Mu Jinbao, Fan Zhenglong, Shen Goulang, Ding Xiaowuzi, Xu Abao, Xu Wende, Chen Zilong, Li Zhongxin, Yang Ruihe, Zhu Yongxiang, Chuan Liangyi, Jiang Yigui, and a woman named Jiang Zhao, a total of sixteen people. They confessed that

The robbery that night

Was carried out with a truck from the Da Hua Transportation Company, driven by driver Lu Asi. The stolen lead ingots were sold to the Tong Feng Xiang store at 630 Beijing Road and the Yong Tai Chang second-hand store at 825 Beijing Road. The Chinese and foreign detectives then went to Da Hua and arrested the owner, Wei Wenzhong. They then apprehended the driver, Lu Asi, on Edward Road, along with the truck with license plate number 2355, and brought them all to the Public Security Bureau. They also went to the Tong Feng Xiang and Yong Tai Chang second-hand stores and recovered a total of fifty-two lead ingots. They also confiscated from Jiang Yuting's home at 28 East Zilaihuo Street

A sales receipt

For the sale of fifty-four lead ingots and brought it to the Public Security Bureau. They were all detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Public Security Bureau lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the case and requested permission for a postponement. Lawyer Fan Gang Yu Enliang defended Mu Jinbao. After Judge Xiao interrogated them, he ordered them to be detained for a postponed hearing next Saturday.

### Smuggling of Gold Bars on the British Yong Sheng Steamer; Value 140,000 to 150,000 Yuan

At 4 PM on the 14th, when the British Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng steamer set sail for Hong Kong, the Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Department searched the ship and discovered a large number of gold bars, worth 150,000 yuan.

### Raid on Drug Den on Route Cardinal Mercier

The French Concession police raided a drug den at 33 Dongxin Lane 111 Route Cardinal Mercier at 3 PM the day before yesterday, arresting forty-six men and women who were smoking drugs, including Lu Changxin, Cai Shaoying, Lu Jinbiao, Wang Asan, Zhang Yusan, Yuan Tianyi, Xu Jincai, Zhu Afu, and Li Shuideng. They confiscated more than forty small packets of morphine and more than fifty smoking pipes. However, the main criminal was at large.

The defendants were detained. The Public Security Bureau has dispatched detectives to investigate and arrest the fugitive mastermind.

### Kidnapping of Young Girls

Car Driver Recognized the Truth

Car Drove into the Police Station

Jiang Fulin, a native of Changzhou, who specializes in kidnapping women, kidnapped two female workers, Shi Sunshi (20 years old, resident of 5 Qianxingfang, Binlang Road) and Zheng Lishi (19 years old), in front of the Shenxin Textile Factory at 4 PM on the 12th of this month and hid them in the home of his accomplice, Mei Yaozong, at 3872 Daxuli, Ma-bai Road. The next day, they led them to the Zhonghua Hotel on Xujiahui Road and locked them in a room for illicit purposes. At 10:30 PM on the 15th, the two kidnappers Jiang and Mei called a rental car from the Zhongshan Automobile Company on Father Jin Road and tricked the two victims into getting into the car, intending to take a boat from Yichang Road Bridge to Changzhou to sell them. Fortunately, the rental car driver Mao Guisheng recognized the truth and, without saying a word, drove the car into the Putuo Road Police Station to report. After an investigation by Hua detective Chen Xianrong, the defendant Jiang Fulin confessed to the kidnapping and sale of the victims. Yesterday morning, the police escorted the defendants to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court and prosecuted them for crimes such as interfering with family harmony. Judge Liu Yugui concluded the trial and ordered them to be detained pending judgment.

### Missing Rental Car Driver Case; Police Conduct Strict Investigation; Notified Water Police to Assist in the Search; Bullets Have Been Examined, No Record Found

On the morning of the 14th, a rental car with a missing driver was discovered on Race Course Road, Longmen Road. There were bloodstains on the driver's seat cushion, and two bullets were found in the car. It was clear that the driver had been killed. The Concession Police Department is making every effort to search for the driver's body.

So far, no body has been found. Yesterday, it was learned that the police have asked the Water Police to assist in the search, fearing that the driver's body may have been sunk in the Huangpu River. According to the police's speculation, the rental car was hired for criminal activity. After the illegal act was completed, the criminals realized that the driver knew too much and took the extreme measure of silencing him. This can be inferred from the bloodstains on the driver's seat, the bullets in the car, and the driver's disappearance. It was also learned that the bullet inspection experts at the Public Security Bureau, upon

Examination results, the bullets found in the car had no previous record. The rental car belongs to the Japanese-owned Xinxing Automobile Company at 170 Wusong Road, Hongkou. At 5:30 PM on the 13th, the company received a phone call to rent a car. Driver Zhao Shanxing (20 years old) drove to the south of Suzhou Creek. However, the car was not returned after a long wait, so the company notified the police. After a search, the mysterious empty car was discovered the next morning on Race Course Road, Longmen Road.

### Female Corpse Discovered on Xinji Bang Road, Hongkou

At approximately 9 AM yesterday, someone passing near Xinji Bang, Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou, saw a female corpse on a vacant lot and immediately reported it to the local police station. Detective number one was dispatched to investigate and sent the female corpse to the Tongren Hospital. An examination revealed that the female corpse was in her twenties. The right temple had a knife wound with a very deep gash, and the brain matter had spilled out. The left arm bone was broken. It appeared she had been murdered. She was wearing a black qipao, a beige undershirt, white cotton trousers, yellow silk stockings, and gray shoes. After an examination by the doctor, the corpse was transferred to the morgue for further examination.

### Owner of Le'an Fang, Avenue Joffre, Shows Consideration for Tenants

The houses in Le'an Fang on Avenue Joffre are managed by the British-owned Taylor & Riley. In February of this year, Taylor & Riley notified all tenants that the rent would be increased by 30%. The tenants strongly refused, arguing that this was an extraordinary period and that they had all come to seek refuge and could not afford such an increase. Later, Taylor & Riley voluntarily reduced the increase to 10%, but the tenants still refused to accept and deposited the rent due in court, which was approved, leading to a stalemate until now. The day before yesterday, Taylor & Riley suddenly had a change of heart and withdrew the rent from the court, canceling the rent increase. The tenants were so grateful for Taylor & Riley's consideration that they sent a letter of thanks. The rent increase dispute, which had lasted for a year, thus came to an end.

### Carelessness at the Tongxing Cotton Mill

The Tongxing Cotton Mill at 1433 Yichang Road, Gordon Road, Shanghai West, was suddenly engulfed in flames at approximately 7 PM last night. Thick smoke billowed everywhere, and the fire was raging.

As a result, dozens of bales of cotton were burned, and the loss was minor.

### Lin Fengmian's Personal Art Exhibition Opens Today

At the Aurora University Auditorium

Lin Fengmian, the former principal of the Hangzhou Art Academy, moved with the entire faculty and students to Guixi, Jiangxi, after the outbreak of the Shanghai-Hangzhou line war. Later, they moved to Yuanling, Hunan. Last year, he resigned from his position and stayed in the countryside of Hunan, dedicating himself to painting. He came to Shanghai this spring and held a personal art exhibition at the French General Association in May, which was well received by the Western press. At that time, most of the visitors were foreigners in this port, and a large number of works were sold. Art circles in this port felt that many Chinese did not have the opportunity to see the exhibition, so they consulted with Mr. Lin and arranged for him to hold another art exhibition at the Aurora University Auditorium on Luba Road for four days, from today to the 20th. The works on display are richer than the last time, totaling approximately 200 pieces, all created during the Anti-Japanese War. Among them, dozens of pieces are based on scenery and folk life from various parts of Hunan, and some are stage scenes depicted by Lin when watching Chinese old dramas, which are full of humor. Lin's works are purely Chinese paintings, and the tools he uses, such as paper, brushes, and pigments, are the same as those used by previous Chinese painters. However, his style and format are mostly unique and completely break away from the stereotypes of traditional Chinese painting. His brushstrokes are simple and vigorous, and his coloring is sparse and clear. The picture is not complicated, but the charm is naturally revealed, which is quite similar to the so-called Impressionist Western paintings. This work has revolutionary significance in the development of Chinese painting art. The exhibition is open from 10 AM to 7 PM, and tickets cost 2 yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### YMCA Sponsors Student Service Society: Used Books and Stationery Can Be Consigned, 10% Commission Deducted Upon Sale

— New Dream

In today's era of rising prices and increasingly difficult living standards, students from families with even slightly better financial situations understand the hardship their parents face in raising tuition fees. When it comes to all the necessary stationery and books needed in school, they can practice frugality to show consideration for their parents. At the same time, the Shanghai Christian Men's and Women's YMCA has recognized this need, so they recently established a Student Service Society.

The Student Service Society is located at 999 Jing'an Temple Road, in the Women's YMCA. The day before yesterday afternoon, to learn about the situation of this service society, I made a special visit. It was in a row of bungalows to the left of the Women's YMCA building, together with the Household Goods Exchange, occupying only a corner of the room. On a long table were dozens of used books, and there was also a bookshelf, which was also full of used books.

At another small writing desk sat a staff member, engrossed in writing. I explained my purpose and chatted with him for a while. It is said that the reason why the Men's and Women's YMCA decided to establish this Student Service Society is to promote thrift, practice conserving material resources, trade books and supplies, and serve students throughout the city. The scope of service includes students' daily books, stationery, and all daily necessities, except for impractical, broken, or damaged items, which are not eligible for service.

If students from various schools have used books, stationery, or daily necessities that are no longer suitable for use but are not damaged, they can directly deliver them to the Student Service Society for display and sale. The price can be set by the owner of the goods, but the service society has the right to re-evaluate the price with the consent of the owner. Once the consigned items are sold, the service society will issue a notice at the end of the month, and the owner can go to collect the proceeds of the sale. The service society will deduct 10% of the price as a handling fee. If the owner can contribute more as a donation, that is especially welcome. This handling fee, after deducting office expenses, will be entirely donated to the Shanghai Christian Men's and Women's YMCA Relief Society as student relief funds.

The length of time for which items are consigned will be determined by the service society. If the consigned items cannot be sold or have been consigned for too long, they will notify the owner, who can retrieve them with the receipt issued upon delivery. If the owner still wants to continue consigning, they must re-register. If the owner does not retrieve the goods after the deadline after receiving the notice, the service society has the right to freely mark them down and auction them off, but the proceeds from the auction, after deducting 20% as a handling fee, will still belong to the owner.

Consignment of goods is not limited to students. Manufacturers who want to entrust the Student Service Society to sell their goods are also welcome. However, there are other methods for them, and the above-mentioned provisions do not apply. Currently, the Student Service Society is in its initial stage and is making every effort to promote the society's affairs and is starting to solicit students from various schools to join in cooperation. If possible, in the future, sales outlets may be set up in schools with large student populations, and the methods will be exactly the same as those of a retail department. Indeed, amidst rising prices, the prices of books and stationery have also repeatedly increased. Many parents cannot afford the burden of their children not attending school, and the YMCA's establishment of this service society is also a need of the times, because while it directly enables students to conserve material resources, it indirectly reduces the burden on parents. It is hoped that all young students in Shanghai will join in cooperation so that the Student Service Society can achieve results that exceed expectations in the future.

### China's Aircraft Manufacturing Plant

— Jin Ji

According to an American expert who is about to fly from Chongqing, speaking to a Chinese reporter in Hong Kong: Somewhere in southwestern China, there is now an aircraft manufacturing plant built by the Chinese government itself, with more than two thousand technicians and a capital of two million. This plant was entirely established by the Chinese government as part of its plan to develop aviation.

Many hardworking young Chinese technicians, under the guidance of fifteen American aircraft manufacturing experts, are constantly working diligently in the factory. In order to avoid becoming a target for air raids, the constructed factory buildings are all hidden in dense forests and have good air defense facilities. In 1933, the factory was roughly outlined in Hangzhou. By 1934, it was able to manufacture aircraft and supply them to the government.

When the war broke out, the factory was close to the front line and was the first to be attacked by air, but the losses were reported to be small. The factory then began to move to Nanjing and then to Hankou. Finally, 180 transport vehicles were used to carry everything from Hankou to the southwest. Although the factory technicians and staff experienced several scares and difficulties, they were still enthusiastic about their work and showed no resentment.

The factory is now located in the countryside, far from large cities, but general transportation is still convenient. If it needs to be moved again, it will not be difficult. The expert also said that the factory's equipment is no less inferior to that of current American aircraft factories. We estimate that the total construction cost of the factory buildings would be about 700,000 yuan. If a similar aircraft factory were to be built in the United States, it would cost at least US$2.5 million. In addition, there are 21 small dormitories specially designed and constructed for American technicians and a clinic with 81 beds.

Because it concerns military secrets, it is not possible to announce how many products the factory has recently produced, but generally speaking, the results must be good, which is foreseeable. The population near the factory is not very large, only about three thousand five, but the output of materials that can be supplied to the factory is considerable. In the past eight months, the expert has flown between the United States and the area 27 times.

### Be Careful of Fire

— Dong Er

"Fire! Fire!" Striking headlines are published on the social news pages, with terrible records of people jumping from buildings and becoming disabled, or even more tragically, being buried in the fire. Winter is the season most prone to fires. People go to bed early because of the cold and ignore the smallest spark. Heating with stoves causes a prairie fire. Especially now, when there are too many people in too little space, how many families are crammed into each residence? One wing is rented out to three households; half a floor is divided into two families. As a result, front, back, left, and right are almost all worlds of coal stoves. And the boundaries are all old, thin pine boards, which have been smoked by coal stoves for a long time. Once a fire starts, it is truly unimaginable!

"Be careful of fire! Be careful!" At the same time, we hear such shouts in the streets and alleys.

Being a night watchman in Shanghai is just a humble job of asking each household for some tips at the end of the month. However, in the dead of night, when everyone is dreaming sweet dreams in a warm bed, they brave the wind and cold, circling through every dark alley, touching every household's back door, knocking on the clapper, and shouting, "Be careful of fire," serving for the safety of people's lives and property. We must thank them for this arduous work.

Therefore, when we wake up from a dream in the middle of the night and hear the shout "Be careful of fire," we should check whether there is a risk of fire around us. Moreover, waking up in the middle of the night is also a time for introspection. The sound of the clapper is a warning of a fire in one's conscience, because the "isolated island" is a place to "be careful of fire!"

Chapter 17: Learning Fieldwork in a New Realm for Reporters, Studying Domestic Affairs in a Small Practice Field at School

This small travel agency at Soochow University has an employee stationed there by the China Travel Service. Because the school has more than 5,000 people, personnel matters are inevitably complicated, so a trust service society was organized. There are many kinds of services, including a small bank, a small store, a small printing press, etc., and there is also a small travel agency. Although there is only one employee in this small travel agency, he is very busy. Because although most of the students at Soochow University are from Jiangsu, there are also many people from other provinces. Especially from Zhejiang Province, and the next most are from Anhui Province. Even people from Sichuan and Guangdong Provinces are coming and going every day, either teachers and students returning to their hometowns, or large groups of students traveling out. Even elementary school students who are sent to study in Europe and the United States can be handled by this travel agency attached to the school. In addition, today is Saturday, which is considered the busiest day. Some people want to take the Beijing-Shanghai Railway home to visit their families, some want to return to eastern and western Zhejiang via the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road, and even those who are not far from Suzhou and take a small motorboat or long-distance bus for only one or two stops entrust this travel agency to handle it, and the travel agency can handle it properly for you. Originally, if you want to travel somewhere, how many people there are, and where the destination is, just make a phone call to the travel agency, and the travel agency will prepare the tickets for you, or send someone to deliver them to you, or you can pick them up yourself. Fortunately, this travel agency is just outside the dormitory, attached to the trust service society, occupying only a small room. You have to pass in front of it every day when you go to school. When the time comes, the travel agency will make a phone call to the train station, bus station, or small steamer wharf, telling them how many tickets have been sold and asking them to reserve that many seats, which is also very convenient. As for the small bank in the trust service society, it is truly small but complete. There is a savings department, a remittance department, a custody department, and a current account department. With such an organization, it is very convenient. Initially, for example, at the beginning of the spring and autumn semesters, when students pay their tuition, they also pay it to this small bank. Students who bring extra money can also deposit it in this bank. Also, if there are any payments of money, you can open a current account, and they will give you a small checkbook. When you want to pay for something, you fill out a small check, and people will also believe you. Because at that time, no one was willing to write a bad check. As long as you write a bad check once, you will lose your lifelong credit, especially in school, where everyone is young! (203)

### A Kirin School Grand Assembly: Dedicated to the Refugee Relief Association

— Only Me

On September 1st, I wrote an article in this publication entitled "Suggestions to the Disaster Relief Authorities to Hold a Kirin School Grand Assembly." Now I hear that this ideal will become a reality. The Refugee Relief Association has tentatively scheduled to hold charity performances for the refugees at the Renxin Theater from the 28th to the 30th of this month for three days. The last day will be based on my suggestion to hold a Kirin School Grand Assembly, but their proposed "Kirin School Grand Assembly" is a joint performance by Zhou Xinfang (麒麟童, aka The Kirin Child) and his disciples, and does not include all Kirin School laosheng (old male role) performers. Therefore, in terms of the playbill, what I proposed earlier will not be suitable for this charity performance. Now, based on the actors they have tentatively decided on, I will re-draft the playbill as follows:

Li Ruchun (Jie Zitui): Burning Mianshan Mountain

Yu Zongying (Ma Chao), Wang Fuying (Zhang Fei): Two Generals

Yang Baotong (Xu Ce): Xu Ce Runs the City

Gao Baisui (Guan Yu)

Zhou Xinfang (Wei Yan), Chen Hefeng (Huang Zhong): Battle of Changsha

Wang Shaolou (Gao Chong): Picking the Hua Che

Li Ruchun (Xiang Bo)

Chen Hefeng (Zhang Liang), Zhou Xinfang (Fan Zeng), Gao Baisui (Xiang Yu), Yang Bintong (Liu Bang), Wang Fuying (Fan Kuai): Hongmen Banquet

The actors in the above playbill are all played by Zhou Xinfang and his disciples. Each person almost plays two plays. In terms of the plays, they are all individual masterpieces. Zhou Xinfang's "Battle of Changsha" is now as popular as "Chasing Han Xin," and his portrayal of Wei Yan is even more unique. This play will surely attract audiences. The finale, "Hongmen Banquet," brings together Kirin School disciples, which can be described as an unprecedented creation. Zhou Xinfang has repeatedly wanted to play Fan Zeng, and this time his wish has come true. In the play "Hongmen Banquet," Fan Zeng occupies a very important position. The personality of this person is difficult to depict, and only Zhou Xinfang can play it successfully. Chen Hefeng is best at playing xiaosheng (young male role) plays, and playing Zhang Liang is just right. Others such as Gao Baisui's Xiang Yu and Wang Fuying's Fan Kuai are known for their superb skills, so this play is a perfect match. If it can be performed, it will surely be a sensation. However, the above playbill can only be performed for 250 minutes, because the actors are limited to Kirin School members, so it is impossible to lengthen it. In my humble opinion, it would be better to invite Kirin School laosheng performers who are not listed in the Kirin School, such as Wang Chunbai and Xu Hongpei, to participate together, which will not only strengthen the lineup but also make the playbill more exciting. In terms of time, adding one or two plays can be performed for more than six hours, which is a perfect plan. I wonder what the gentlemen of the Refugee Relief Association think?

### Zheng Mengxia Remarries a Leather Shoe Merchant

— Cui Ping

Zheng Mengxia, a "Southern and Northern Tones" female performer, co-starred in Peking Opera with Zhao Ruquan in Shanghai several years ago. Later, she went to sea as a dancer and finally starred in the detective film "New Marriage Massacre" at Yihua Film Company. Zheng is naturally intelligent and exceptionally perceptive. She has made special progress and can also sing Peking Opera on stage. After studying Peking Opera for two years, she was able to perform on stage; after studying English for less than two years, she could converse with English people; after going to Singapore for a few months, she spoke fluent Singaporean dialect. Her talent can be seen. She was previously married to Chen Gaocong, and their love was extremely strong after marriage. Chen unfortunately died of illness in Hong Kong last autumn. When Chen was seriously ill, Zheng served him day and night, personally serving him medicine and mortgaging things to pay for medical treatment, without letting Chen know. However, Chen eventually died. Zheng was forced by livelihood to go to sea as a dancer and also appeared on the screen. Recently, she has remarried a wealthy leather shoe merchant in Hong Kong. On the day of the wedding, Hu Die personally went to congratulate her.

Zheng's previous husband, Chen Gaocong, was a famous dancer. Several years ago, Shanghai RCA Radio Company held a Shanghai-wide dance competition (to promote the company's new radios). The winning couple would receive the company's latest model radio and be invited to Hollywood at the company's expense. At that time, because there were no restrictions on the qualifications of the participants, all the dancers in Shanghai participated. The most competitive were Li Li from Beiping, who had just returned from the United States, and the Liang sisters, who are now dancers in Singapore. As a result, the winning couple was Zheng Mengxia and Chen Gaocong. At that time, the names of Zheng Mengxia and Chen Gaocong were widely publicized in Chinese and foreign newspapers in Shanghai. Li Li, who was full of champion ambition, was relegated to second place, which is truly a good story.

### Entertainment News

— Yuan You

The Anti-Japanese Touring Troupe organized by artists Jin Shan, Dai Zonghao, Zhu Lian, etc. in Guilin has been directly under the Guangxi Provincial Government Education Department since October of this year. The provincial government subsidizes it with 2,000 yuan of national currency per month. The troupe will now tour and perform anti-Japanese dramas in various war zones near the province for a long time.

Cai Chusheng's second new work after "Orphan Island Paradise," "Like a Dream, Not a Dream," will be filmed in mid-October. The play is based on "The Runaway Nurse," written by the great British writer Hugh Walpole, and tells the story of the life of the heroic woman Holman Lee during the Great War of 1914.

Ms. Lan Ping, who was once rumored to have married Communist leader Mao Zedong, has now officially joined the Chongqing China Film Studio and is said to be performing in the film "Young Pioneers" directed by Sun Yu.

Bai Yang is suffering from a severe cold in Chongqing. According to her personal account, the cause of the illness was the fright she suffered during the last enemy air raid on Chongqing.

The military service propaganda film "Good Husband," directed by Shi Dongshan, has been completed and is scheduled to premiere in Xindu on the anniversary of the Premier's birthday. It is said that the film has been ordered to be screened in cities across the country to promote military service.

The American "World Technical Corps," which tours the world, is hosted by Miss Kelley, a famous female strongwoman from the United States weighing 360 pounds. She arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The authorities of the Xindu Theater in this city specially welcomed her and persuaded her to hold special performances at the Xindu for several days starting today. Miss Kelley became internationally famous ten years ago for surviving being run over by a 2,000-pound car and having iron hammered on her stomach with an 800-pound anvil. This time in Shanghai, she will surely refresh the ears and eyes of the people of Shanghai.

### A Meeting with Tang Huaiqiu

— Hua

Tang Huaiqiu has come to Shanghai. On the night of his arrival in Shanghai, he went to the Xuan Palace Theater to watch his daughter Ruoqing's "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty." When I first discovered him, even we old friends who met every day during the Carlton period almost didn't recognize him. He was wearing dark glasses and had a thick mustache. After only a year apart, this "young father" had actually aged.

That day, because he didn't want to miss this sensational "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," after shaking hands, we agreed to talk again the next day and then separated.

The next day, Tang Huaiqiu, who was standing in front of me backstage at Xuan Palace, had regained his youthful and talkative appearance from two years ago. I pretended to point at his mustache, and he grabbed my hand and whispered in my ear as if he were acting:

"My old man doesn't have a beard yet, and the son is keeping this..." He touched his bare upper and lower lips, "It seems a little embarrassing, right?" Although he pretended to be whispering, his voice was still very loud, and the actors in the dressing room couldn't help but laugh.

Tang Ruoqing was just putting on makeup. He turned around and looked at his father and smiled at the mirror. He said to me:

"I was reminded of something. A few days ago, there was a 'Nanguo Entertainment Scene' in your newspaper that said that Ruoying and I were at odds with our father. In fact, the incident at 'China Travel' in Hong Kong was very complicated, and the outside world cannot understand the surface reasons. But I have one sentence I can say, which is that the blame should not be entirely placed on my father. This time my sister came to Shanghai to study, and because I have been away from Shanghai for two years, I also wanted to take this opportunity to come and have some fun, which caused the outside world to say that Ruoying and I were at odds with our father. Now that Dad is back, that is the factual answer."

At that moment, several old friends were urging Tang Huaiqiu to also guest-star in a play at Xuan Palace, but the old actor used a diversion tactic and began to tell a story.

We had heard that story several times in the Carlton building. As soon as we heard his opening remarks, we knew that once his talk box was opened, there would be no stopping. The lights in the theater had already dimmed, and Huaiqiu took the opportunity to say, "Oh dear, I don't have time to put on makeup!"

### Leisurely Painting the Entertainment World (21) Yunnan Opera

— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan

Yunnan Opera is a unique local opera in Yunnan and is similar to Peking Opera in appearance.

Various local operas can be seen in Shanghai; only Yunnan Opera has not yet had a "chance to meet" the people of Shanghai.

The scripts, scenes, and performances are all the same as Peking Opera, only the pronunciation, dialogue, and clown's interludes maintain the "Yunnan scenery."

In addition, the use of a tanggu drum for rhythm in each play is also unique to Yunnan Opera.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Old Actors Rely on Skill to Make a Living, New Performers Rely on Building the Crowd to Make Money

The first day's opening play, "Wang Baochuan," sold out completely. The grand scenes of the second and third days were not much diminished. The people who came to listen to the opera, because they saw in the golden advertisement the news that Wang Yaoqing, the old court musician, was "personally supervising the scene," so all those who sat in the lower arena (connoisseurs who watched the opera liked to find seats in front of the lower arena door) invariably craned their necks before Yurong was about to appear on stage, looking straight into the upper arena door. Sure enough, they saw an old man wearing dark glasses, extending two fingers towards the musicians and drummers on stage, using hand signals to make a greeting. Thus, Yurong stepped onto the stage amid thunderous applause. According to the rules of opera performance in the past, there was no such thing as a private huqin. Famous actors among the court musicians, such as Gui Fen, Tan Xinpei, and Sun Juxian, etc., such famous figures, never used exclusive musicians and drummers. Among those famous actors, there were only Mei Yutian and Sun Zuochen who played the huqin. As for when each person was about to go on stage, they always extended two or three fingers towards the stage, which was an indication to the person playing the instrument to use the flute to tune the strings to the correct palace tune or B character tune. Only Gui Fen's voice was the best, and the tune was particularly high. Every time he appeared on stage, he simply flicked his sleeves, implying that no matter what three limits you set, I don't care if you want me to sing the upper word tune. However, at that time, it was very common to be able to sing the B character tune. Like Old Tan, who could only eat the tune to the correct palace, he was still ridiculed at the time as being softly decadent. As for those who sang the six-character tune, they simply had no qualifications to perform on stage. (143)
