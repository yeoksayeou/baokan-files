### A Glimmer of Hope for European Peace: Germany Proposes a Solution with Five Conditions; British Ambassador Returns to London; Italian Prime Minister Suggests Convening a Four-Power Conference

London: It is believed that German leader Hitler received British Ambassador Henderson yesterday at 3:00 PM, and well-informed sources consider this conversation extremely important. (Haitong Telegram, 26th)

London: British Ambassador to Germany Henderson returned here from Germany today with Hitler's peace proposals, and held a three-hour meeting with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax. He then entered Buckingham Palace to meet with the King. The Cabinet is scheduled to hold a full meeting tonight to consider Hitler's suggestions given to Henderson. (Reuters, 26th)

London: "The Daily Express" recently reported that German leader Hitler yesterday delivered to British Ambassador to Germany Sir Henderson a letter to be taken back to London, containing five peace terms proposed to the British government: (1) If Britain agrees to abolish the remaining "unequal treaties" of the Treaty of Versailles and return Germany's former colonies, Germany would be willing to sign a non-aggression treaty with it; (2) The Free City of Danzig should be returned to Germany; (3) Poland would enjoy certain rights in the Free City of Danzig for a period of ten years, in exchange for allowing Germany to build a highway through the Polish Corridor; (4) Germany and Poland should hold meetings to discuss maintaining public order and preventing anti-German terrorist activities within Poland; (5) After the dispute between Germany and Poland is resolved, Germany can sign a non-aggression treaty with Poland, and Germany will guarantee Poland's border for a period of ten years. (Havas, 26th)

Rome: Foreign observers here have recently stated that Prime Minister Mussolini proposed to German leader Hitler to convene a four-power conference without preconditions, but requested that military action not be taken against Poland before a peaceful solution to the Danzig issue is found. It is rumored that this proposal has been accepted by German leader Hitler. Mussolini also intends to first hold a four-power conference, and then expand the scope to allow other countries to participate in discussions on other European issues. In addition, the German Ambassador to Italy and the Italian Ambassador to Germany held a long-distance telephone conversation yesterday to convey the opinions of Prime Minister Mussolini and German leader Hitler, which has attracted great attention from political figures here, who believe that war can hopefully be eliminated at the last moment. (Havas, 26th)

Rome: Newspapers recently commented on the European situation, stating that the situation is extremely serious, but also issuing hints that the current crisis has a "ray of hope." The Messenger reported that "Catastrophe is not impossible to prevent; new hope seems not without basis. At this last minute, there is still the possibility of negotiations. Credible common sense has been restored. Prime Minister Mussolini and German leader Hitler have repeatedly exchanged views, and Foreign Minister Ciano and authorities in various European countries are also actively engaged in diplomatic efforts, sparing no effort. All of this has revealed a glimmer of hope. British Ambassador to Germany Henderson's return to London with German leader Hitler's peace plan is also a good sign." (Havas, 26th)

Rome: The semi-official Stefani News Agency recently issued a message stating that German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini exchanged views several times yesterday. The German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, also conveyed Hitler's views to Prime Minister Mussolini via long-distance telephone at 3:00 PM, with Foreign Minister Ciano also present. The Italian Ambassador to Germany, Attolico, then notified German leader Hitler of Prime Minister Mussolini's reply at 6:00 PM. By 9:30 PM, Ambassador Mackensen again conveyed Hitler's views from the telephone to Prime Minister Mussolini. (Havas, 26th)

London: British Ambassador to Germany Henderson again met with Hitler yesterday, making a second effort to avert European war, and is scheduled to fly back to London today to report to Foreign Secretary Halifax. This news has raised hopes in political circles, believing that there is now a way to break the deadlock and curb the sharp trend towards war. Henderson's return to Britain clearly carries proposals or questions that require a British response. (Reuters, 26th)

### President Roosevelt: Renews Call for Peace to Germany; Hopes to Resolve Dispute Through Negotiations; Polish President Responds with Acceptance

Washington: After President Roosevelt telegraphed the leaders of Germany, Italy, and Poland, Polish President Mościcki replied yesterday, agreeing to comply. He stated: "I have received your respectful telegram and am most impressed. My government has always believed that direct negotiations are the most appropriate way to resolve international disputes, especially between countries that share a border. In the past, we have signed non-aggression treaties with both Germany and the Soviet Union based on this principle. As for third-party mediation, we also consider it a fair way to resolve international disputes. Although it is not necessary to mention all the issues that have caused the dispute, I must say that it is not my country that has made demands or requested concessions from other countries. Your telegram advocates that both sides avoid hostile actions during negotiations, which the enemy naturally agrees with, but only if the other party also avoids direct or indirect hostile actions. At this time, all countries and nations in the world are eager for universal pacification to revitalize their inherent civilization. I pray that your call for peace will contribute to this pacification work, Mościcki." (Havas, 26th)

Washington: After receiving the reply from Polish President Mościcki, President Roosevelt immediately telegraphed German leader Hitler a second time, stating: "I have just received a telegram from Polish President Mościcki, clearly expressing his agreement with the direct negotiations and mediation methods proposed in my respectful telegram. If you and your government also agree and are willing to resolve the current dispute through peaceful means, then the lives of millions of people still have a chance to be preserved, and the hope of establishing peaceful relations among modern nations worldwide and achieving prosperity still has a chance to be realized. People all over the world are eagerly awaiting your country to express its agreement following Poland. I am sending this telegram again, hoping you will understand, Roosevelt." (Havas, 26th)

### French Prime Minister Reaffirms Determination to Resist Aggression; Europe's Fate Lies in the Polish Question; Harshly Condemns Soviet Union's Treachery

Paris: Prime Minister Daladier delivered a broadcast address to the nation at 9:00 PM tonight. The gist of it is as follows: I will do everything in my power to avoid war, but if forcible methods are allowed to run rampant, the freedom of all nations in the world will inevitably be destroyed, and the French nation will not be spared. Therefore, we are determined to resist. The following is an excerpt of the full text: The Prime Minister first stated, "My character is known to the people of the country, and I will do everything in my power to avoid war. This should be deeply believed by the people of the country." All international issues can be resolved through negotiations. The issue of Danzig involves the freedom and survival of Poland, which is enough to trigger a European war. "The so-called freedom and survival of Poland is the freedom and survival of 35 million souls, which is related to the fate of other European countries. France is no exception. If our country sits idly by and watches other countries succumb one by one, the result will be that our country will not only lose its honor but also be isolated due to the demise of its allies, and we will not be able to come out and help them." In order to organize a peace front, our country has accepted constraints from countries willing to participate in this front and has conducted negotiations with the Soviet Union, but unexpectedly that country "suddenly changed its policy" and signed a treaty with Germany, evading the obligations arising from its past policies. "The negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union on a mutual assistance treaty were both ambiguous and suitable for publication at this time, and the content of the treaty is such that it increases the risk of France and its allies being subjected to aggression." US President Roosevelt and King Leopold III of Belgium have successively called for peace, and we admire their benevolent words. France sincerely responds to this. Fortunately, Poland's attitude is both calm and brave. Britain and France are determined to protect the freedom and independence of all nations and the honor of all mankind, hoping that wisdom will ultimately prevail. Unfortunately, I will ask all male and female citizens to face it with courage. "We French people want to maintain freedom and live in peace, but we are determined not to be driven and subjugated by violence and injustice." (Havas, 25th)

Paris: The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies met this afternoon and immediately discussed the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. Deputies from all parties unanimously condemned the Soviet Union for "betraying its friends," saying that this matter only increased the possibility of war breaking out. They then passed a motion expressing their protest. However, the communist members believed that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty did not conflict with the organization of a peace front, so they refused to vote. The Communist Party faction of the Chamber of Deputies also met in the afternoon, and Secretary-General Thorez immediately gave a speech, expressing his support for the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, but said that if Germany continues to invade, the Communist Party members will unite with the people of the country to resist it. In addition, the Socialist Party faction also held a meeting and decided not to cooperate with the Communist Party because the Communist Party supported the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. (Havas, 25th)

### Belgian King's Call for Peace; Britain and the United States Respond

Brussels: The British government today replied to the telegram from the Belgian King calling for peace, saying that the British government has always been prepared to do its utmost to assist in the resolution of all disputes through free negotiations. Recognition of solutions by force or threats of force would only destroy efforts to establish an international peace order to uphold peace and justice without violating any national rights or independence. (Reuters, 26th)

Washington: President Roosevelt recently telegraphed King Leopold III of Belgium, stating, "I am very pleased to hear that Your Majesty issued a declaration on behalf of the signatory countries of the Oslo Convention the other day, calling for peace. Your Majesty hopes that the leaders of other countries will also respond with a desire to maintain peace and security. I would like to state that my government and people share the same feelings as Your Majesty." (Havas, 25th)

### German General Mobilization Temporarily Postponed; Tannenberg Commemoration Cancelled

London: According to the Daily Express, the general mobilization originally scheduled to take effect at 3:00 AM this morning has now been temporarily postponed. At the same time, Hitler's speech commemorating the victory of the Battle of Tannenberg, which was scheduled to be delivered yesterday, has also been postponed. According to a British cabinet member, the situation has slightly improved. It is rumored that senior German military authorities have differing opinions on military action, and President Roosevelt's call for peace is also one of the reasons for the temporary delay in the deterioration of the situation. (Associated Press, 26th)

Berlin: The long-publicized Tannenberg victory commemoration ceremony, originally scheduled for tomorrow, has now been cancelled. This news was announced last night by the German official news agency. It is said that due to the serious situation, the solemn ceremony originally scheduled to be held in Tannenberg on Sunday will not be held. This ceremony was to commemorate the great victory of the German army in defeating the Russian army that invaded East Prussia in August 1914. Hitler had originally planned to attend and speak. Last night, Hitler was still revising his prepared speech due to the recent developments in the situation, which shows that the cancellation of the commemoration ceremony was a last-minute decision. (Reuters, 26th)

### Hitler Meets with Four Ambassadors; Explains Position on Poland; Japan Protests Betrayal of Friendship

Paris: According to French sources, Premier Hitler has destroyed all hope for European peace after meeting with the ambassadors of Britain, France, Italy, and Japan in Berlin yesterday. It is claimed that Premier Hitler warned the ambassadors of the democratic countries in Germany, instructing them to inform their governments that Germany should adopt a "prudent" attitude due to Poland's "atrocities" against Germany. His words implied that Germany's plan had decided to take clear retaliatory action against Poland. In another report on Hitler's conversation with the ambassadors, Hitler stated that Germany must "seize" Poland to end the German-Polish dispute. At the same time, it is reported that Hitler proposed convening a world conference, but did not indicate whether the conference would be held before or after the Polish issue was resolved. (Associated Press, 26th)

Berlin: When German leader Hitler separately met with the ambassadors of Italy, Britain, France, and Japan in Germany this afternoon, it was rumored that he declared his intention to take action to protect Germans within Poland, and said that the current situation is like a vessel filled with water, which will overflow with the slightest disturbance. However, political figures here have all gained the impression that Germany may be trying to promote a conference to resolve the Danzig issue in a way that is favorable to Germany. According to diplomatic sources, Japanese Ambassador General Oshima protested to German leader Hitler about the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty and stated that the fourth article of the treaty, in the view of the Japanese government, contradicts the Anti-Comintern Pact. (Note: Article 4 states that any group that is directly or indirectly detrimental to one of the signatory countries, the other party shall not participate in it.) (Havas, 25th)

### Germany Offers Guarantees to the Netherlands and Belgium

Brussels: German Ambassador Bülow recently paid a visit to King Leopold III and solemnly declared to him that if war breaks out in Europe, Germany is willing to abide by the guarantee provided on October 13, 1937, and not violate Belgium's territorial integrity in any way and respect Belgium's borders, but only on the condition that Belgium strictly adheres to neutrality. (Havas, 26th)

The Hague: The German minister recently paid a visit to Queen Wilhelmina in the afternoon and declared to her that if war breaks out in Europe, Germany will not violate the territorial integrity of the Netherlands and is willing to respect its borders, but only on the condition that the Netherlands strictly adheres to neutrality. (Havas, 26th)

Berlin: Japanese nationals are scheduled to leave Germany by special train within days. In addition, all aircraft on Lufthansa Airlines' international routes have recently been decided to cease operations. (Havas, 26th)

### British Labour Party Publishes Letter to the German People; Rashly Starting a War Will Bring Disaster Upon Themselves; It is Not Too Late to Turn Back

London: The British Labour Party published a letter to the German people, stating that Britain and France's determination to fulfill their promises will not be shaken by the German-Soviet treaty, and said, "War is imminent. If Hitler attacks Poland, it will not only be a war between Germany and Poland, but from that day on, it will be a war between Germany and Britain and France. Your government does not tell the truth. British workers have always been friends of the German people, so we tell you the truth. Your government has recently concluded a non-aggression treaty with Moscow. The government you have heard for six years is your greatest enemy has now become your friend in history. British workers now tell you with a very solemn attitude that this agreement will never affect the position of Britain and France. Germany lacks raw materials and food. If war breaks out, it will feel great difficulty in finding supplies because Britain and France will control the sea. We have no intention of destroying the German people. We have always been your friends. We are now telling you the truth as best we can while it is not too late. Peace can be preserved. If peace is preserved at this time, a new world of a new Europe can be created." (Reuters, 26th)

### International Situation Not Optimistic; Observations from Paris

Paris: Political figures have recently declared that although there is a possibility of negotiations in the current international crisis, the hope of a peaceful resolution is extremely slim. Officials from Britain, France, and Poland believe that democratic countries will never allow independent and autonomous countries to be dominated by others out of fear of the threat of war. As for the Axis powers, Italy's actions seem very active. The country's military position is extremely fragile, and it is unwilling to be a pawn and get caught up in the war vortex. Now that US President Roosevelt has requested mediation from the King of Italy, the country is likely to act as a mediator. However, it is still unknown to what extent German leader Hitler will accept Prime Minister Mussolini's opinion and back down. As for Italy's proposal to convene a four-power conference, since Poland is not included, it has a strong resemblance to the Second Munich Agreement. However, this plan has not been completely abandoned. Germany also seems not to reject negotiations. It is known from the temporary cancellation of the Tannenberg victory commemoration on the 27th of this month that German leader Hitler does not want to publicly deliver a speech that would restrict himself and wants to adopt a more flexible diplomatic approach. This is a good sign. However, Germany's ambitions are not limited to annexing Danzig. It also intends to recover all the territories of the country and the former Austro-Hungarian Empire before the European War. This is a reason for pessimism. (Havas, 26th)

### Britain Prepares to Form a Wartime Cabinet; Recruiting Figures from All Factions

London: Observers have recently declared that if war breaks out, Britain will form a wartime cabinet, recruiting all key figures from the Conservative Party who have served as cabinet members, as well as leaders from various opposition parties. A cabinet sub-committee will be organized by Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, Minister for Coordination of Defence Chatfield, opposition Labour Party leader Attlee, Liberal Party leader Sinclair, and Conservative Party far-right leader Churchill, to preside over everything. In addition, former Foreign Secretary Eden may also re-enter the cabinet. (Havas, 25th)

### Britain Intensifies Implementation of Precautionary Measures

London: Official sources have recently declared that various precautionary measures decided by the cabinet a few days ago have been rapidly implemented, and they are able to cope with any eventuality. However, the official refused to disclose how many reservists have been called up. According to general speculation, the strength of the British Army, including both active and reserve personnel, totals as many as 800,000. In the future, it will continue to be increased in accordance with the situation. In addition, the air defense force has been changed to wartime organization since June. In the past two days, it has been continuously strengthened. The evacuation of civilians from major cities is being planned. Teachers in small schools who are on vacation have been recalled to prepare for the evacuation of students. As soon as they receive an order from the authorities, it will be implemented. Shops and offices in the central area of London have been equipped with bomb-proof facilities. Larger businesses installed bomb shelters in September last year. In the West End, where aristocratic residences and clubs are concentrated, most houses have wire mesh installed on their windows to defend against shrapnel. Today, the Privy Council met at Buckingham Palace and decided to intensify the implementation of precautionary measures. The details will be published tomorrow. (Havas, 25th)

Editorial

### England and Germany and the International Situation

Will there be peace or war in Europe? If peace, what will be the method of resolving disputes, and how will each country yield or stand firm? If war, how will allies and enemies be distinguished, and how will the two sides fare in victory or defeat? These are the current questions, and almost everyone on the street is grabbing someone to ask for answers. This is because the matter concerns not just a corner of Europe, but its influence extends far into the world and future generations, and everyone should pay attention to it. The reporter is perhaps ignorant and dull. With the matter pressing, not only do I not know the answer, but I also know that there are only a handful of heroes who can command the winds and clouds, and truly insightful individuals in the world. Yet, I wonder who can actually answer. Some decisively say there will be war, and others say there will be no war. But I secretly suspect that their words are no different from gamblers shouting dice rolls. Why is it so elusive? All the countries in the vortex have their own desires and policies they are determined to pursue. If everything could be decided by following the desire and policy of one side, then naturally there would be no further questions after the decision. The question lies in the intertwining of the desires and policies of various countries. It is not possible for one side to decide everything, and the reactions to this intertwining have unlimited possibilities for evolution. Only because there are too many possible evolutions, and one cannot grasp what is inevitable, is there an indivisible moment between peace and war, and everyone circles around this single strand. Therefore, both sides are mobilizing, conscripting, evacuating expatriates, changing the routes of merchant ships, giving speeches with stern expressions, and displaying actions with drawn swords and strung bows – none of these are not signs of the eve of a great war. However, the diplomatic prelude has not yet ended. For example, Polish President Mościcki's telegram in response to US President Roosevelt's suggestion to accept mediation, Roosevelt's re-telegram to German leader Hitler, and British Ambassador to Germany Henderson's return to England with a letter from Hitler, all happened yesterday. From this, one can glimpse that the hope for peace has not been completely extinguished.

Given the current situation, how can one definitively say whether there will be war or not, or even need to deduce whether there will be war or not? Affirmations and deductions are all verbose. What we do not tire of discussing is that the Soviet Union and Germany concluded a treaty of non-aggression. Regardless of how it was brewing, regardless of how long the decision took, the two countries clearly expressed the complete change in their policies only from the date of the signing and publication of the treaty of non-aggression. As this newspaper said the other day, with the complete and clear expression of the change in the policies of the two countries, everything concerning international relations must be "re-evaluated and reconsidered." This is undoubtedly the last opportunity for re-evaluation and consideration in this indivisible moment between peace and war. As for Germany, it certainly has its own desires and policies that it is determined to pursue, and it must have had a well-thought-out plan when it resolutely concluded the treaty of non-aggression with the Soviet Union. However, the content of the treaty, the tacit understanding established during negotiations with the Soviet Union when concluding the treaty, and the international reaction obtained in terms of spirit and reality after the conclusion of the treaty, are not entirely within Germany's desires and policies that it is determined to pursue. For example, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop believed that the Soviet-German treaty would have a good influence on Soviet-Japanese relations and German-Japanese friendship, and that Germany could mediate the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan. Who knew that Japan would be greatly angered, protesting to Germany outwardly, accusing it of betraying a friend, and abandoning its planned European strategy internally, drafting a new plan instead. Was this reaction anticipated? Then, after concluding the treaty with the Soviet Union, should Germany not re-evaluate and reconsider based on reality? I believe that there are two things that Germany urgently needs to re-evaluate and consider: (1) Germany's handling of Poland and the Free City of Danzig should greatly change its various attitudes and methods of the past six months to achieve a satisfactory solution to the outstanding issues. Germany's momentum, subjectively, is no longer what it used to be, and objectively, it is universally acknowledged, so it may as well abandon its original attitude and methods. (2) Germany should greatly change its pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese policy towards the Far East. In the past, what was needed from Japan was to shout and cheer, so as to benefit Germany's actions in Europe. Today, the needs are different, and Japan's unwillingness to be used by Germany again is undeniable. Therefore, Germany should recognize China as a long-time friendly and good customer, and restore its former friendship with China, maintaining this rich and great market. Moreover, the discord between England and Germany is due to something else and not because of China. That is, in the Far East, with China as the center, forming a multi-faceted harmony between China, England, China, the Soviet Union, and China, and Germany, is indeed something that can be done in parallel without conflicting.

As for England, everything it has encountered deserves sympathy. After the Soviet Union and Germany joined hands, it was natural for it to revise and transform its policies. The so-called revision and transformation should not mean abandoning its obligations. For example, the Anglo-Polish alliance was just completed yesterday, which is a strong indication of England's determination to fulfill its obligations. However, the main purpose of the Anglo-Polish alliance is to help each other and achieve a win-win situation. To seek the best of mutual assistance and win-win, it is necessary to consider each other, understand each other, and help each other. England should consider Poland, and Poland should also consider England. In this sense, England and Poland should examine the evolving environment, understand the difficult reality, and consider the standards that the two countries must fight for, so that what we do today should be different from what we did in the past, and jointly plan for a foolproof plan. I think that England should pay attention to this, firstly. England's main lifeline is overseas, and its first bulwark and first powerful enemy are both in the Far East. Is the first bulwark not something that must be protected? Is the first powerful enemy not something that must be guarded against? China should be the first choice to jointly protect the bulwark in the Far East and jointly defend against the powerful enemy in the Far East. In the past, although England had no demands on the European continent, it always considered it an urgent task to help stabilize the European continent. However, not only did it labor in vain, but it also became deeply involved in the vortex. Therefore, after this drastic change in the international situation, should England not abandon its old ways after fulfilling its absolutely necessary obligations on the European continent, and from now on value its overseas lifeline and strengthen Sino-British relations? I think that England should pay attention to this, secondly. If England and Germany are like this, other countries should promptly re-evaluate and reconsider everything about international relations, which is also similar.

### German-Polish Border: Disputes Emerge Endlessly, German Plane Violates Polish Airspace and Is Shot Down, Warsaw Busily Digging Trenches Around the City

Warsaw: A German bomber flying over the fortress area of Gdynia (near Danzig) in Poland, ignored warnings from Polish air defense forces and continued to circle, eventually being shot down by anti-aircraft guns. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Danzig: According to sources here, a third German plane was shot at by Polish anti-aircraft guns.

(Haitong dispatch, 26th)

Danzig: The city's police authorities recently occupied three stations on the railway line connecting the city to Poland (which is the property of the Polish government) and disarmed Polish police. As seen by foreigners, the National Socialist Party's actions in the Free City aim to eliminate various Polish rights, which is clearly evident. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Danzig: Another dispute recently occurred at the border between the city and Poland. Two Polish soldiers were shot and killed by several city border guards 400 meters inside the Free City of Danzig. According to German sources, the two Polish soldiers invaded Danzig, and the city's border guards ordered them to stop, but the soldiers ignored the order and fired first, leading to their deaths at the hands of the border guards. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Warsaw: According to information received here, another dispute occurred recently on the German-Polish border. A team of German sentries, carrying light machine guns, crossed the border near Misielnice in East Prussia, invading Polish territory by one kilometer and firing at Polish border guards. The border guards immediately returned fire, killing one sentry, while the others abandoned their light machine guns and fled back to Germany. In addition, authorities responsible for the matter have denied German newspaper reports that Polish anti-aircraft gun teams fired at three German transport planes, stating that a German plane had flown at high altitude over the Polish coastal defense area and that Polish anti-aircraft gun teams had fired warning shots, after which the plane immediately flew away. (Vahas dispatch, 25th) Moscow: Polish government authorities cut off telegraph and telephone lines to Germany last night, thus severing direct communication between the two countries. Prior to this, the Warsaw government had blockaded most of the border adjacent to Germany, as both German and Polish troops were actively reinforcing their borders. As for the border between Poland and Danzig, it was already blockaded by the authorities of the Free City of Danzig. Furthermore, telephone and telegrams from Poland to Germany must be relayed through Moscow communication agencies, as communication between Poland and the Soviet Union has not been interrupted at present. (Associated Press dispatch, 26th)

Warsaw: The mayor of Warsaw recently issued an order for city residents to help dig trenches around the city. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

Warsaw: The city is actively preparing for air defense and preparing black strips of paper to be pasted on the doors and windows of public institutions when necessary to prevent light from leaking out. The city government has also posted notices in various districts, urging people to cooperate with the authorities in digging air-raid shelters, building bomb shelters, and stockpiling food to maintain the food supply during wartime. The general public is now rushing to buy anti-gas masks. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

### US Government Discusses the International Situation, State Department Has Drafted Plans for the Evacuation of US Citizens

Washington: President Roosevelt convened a meeting of various departments at 2 pm to discuss the international situation, which lasted for one hour. Afterwards, Secretary of State Hull immediately returned to the State Department to convene a meeting of various department heads to discuss (1) the impact of the war on the American economy and ways to prevent and remedy it, and (2) how to protect American citizens in war zones. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Washington: The State Department recently announced that plans for the evacuation of American citizens in the event of war in Europe have been drafted as follows: (1) The State Department will set up a special office to handle the repatriation of American citizens. (2) Diplomatic missions established by the United States in various capitals and major commercial centers will establish special offices to resolve "the protection of the interests of foreign governments after the severance of diplomatic relations and other issues." According to the State Department, the purpose of the second measure is that, after the outbreak of war, a belligerent government may request the United States to take care of its interests in enemy territory, and the US government is prepared to accept this. The evacuation of American citizens will be carried out by commercial ships rather than warships, but in remote areas, warships will be used to escort them to major ports so that American citizens can board ships to return home. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Washington: President Roosevelt recently made a statement to the press, stating that (1) if the situation in Europe does not show signs of easing by the 28th of this month, he will remain in Washington, (2) although his telegram to German leader Hitler advocated for the selection of mediators to resolve the German-Polish dispute, he has no preconceived notions about the selection of these individuals, (3) the current crisis in Europe will inevitably affect the lives of Americans, and the US government has made preparations to minimize various impacts, and (4) the situation in Europe will not necessarily lead to war, and he does not intend to convene Congress for a special session until he is certain that war in Europe is imminent. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Washington: Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison recently made a statement that the US Navy has sufficient strength to cope with any situation.

(7) If both signatory countries join the war, they shall not make peace separately.

(8) The term of validity of this treaty is set at five years and may be terminated by declaration six months before its expiration; otherwise, it shall be automatically extended after its expiration, but may be terminated by prior notice of six months. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

### Britain Ceases Supporting the Pound Sterling Exchange Rate, Has Notified the United States

London: Acting Chancellor of the Exchequer Hannes announced today that Britain has notified the United States, stating that it has ceased supporting the pound sterling. The US Treasury Department believes that this move by Britain is not a competitive devaluation of the currency, but a necessary step due to recent heavy losses of gold reserves. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

London: The emergency financial plans recently adopted by the Bank of England and the Treasury Department, such as raising the bank rate and setting minimum prices for bonds, are considered by important figures in the banking community to be the most appropriate measures feasible in the current situation. The purpose is to maintain the country's assets. This is the entire measure of the new temporary policy. The increase in the bank rate from 2% to 4% is intended to restrict borrowing by private enterprises within Britain, as borrowing to revitalize private enterprises should wait until times are better. The increase in the interest rate can also reduce the withdrawal of foreign capital. As for not maintaining the pound sterling exchange rate, the main purpose is to maintain domestic gold reserves in an emergency. At the same time, to prevent panic sellers from selling public bonds, the measures taken last September were adopted, limiting the minimum prices of British public bonds. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

New York: Bankers estimate that British gold reserves have now decreased to £440,000,000. However, the financial plans currently adopted by Britain can prevent or at least reduce the outflow of gold. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

### Germany Encourages Japan to Conclude a Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union, Hiranuma Plans to Reorganize the Internal Front First, Then Formulate a New Diplomatic Policy

Moscow: News here today states that Germany is attempting to persuade Japan to sign a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. Japanese sources here acknowledge that Germany has made this request, but state that Germany has clearly failed to understand the relationship of this action to the complex situation in the Far East. They claim that it is practically impossible for Japan and the Soviet Union to sign a non-aggression pact. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

Berlin: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop received Japanese Ambassador General Oshima yesterday afternoon. Although no official announcement has been made, it is widely believed that Oshima conveyed the decision of the Japanese cabinet to protest the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact. Germany's attitude can be seen in Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's remarks to reporters, in which Mr. Ribbentrop said that he firmly believed that this treaty would have a good influence not only on German-Soviet relations, but also on Japanese-Soviet relations. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

Rome: Political figures here believe that the diplomatic prelude in the international crisis has not yet ended and that there may be surprising developments to come. This refers to the possibility that Japan and the Soviet Union may sign a non-aggression treaty. If this were to happen, the power of the totalitarian countries would overwhelm the democracies. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Moscow: Experienced observers here recently stated that Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo suggested to the Soviet government before German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived here that the current disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan be resolved. Afterwards, before Foreign Minister Ribbentrop departed from here for Germany, he stated that he firmly believed that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty would have a good influence on Soviet-Japanese relations and German-Japanese friendship. Based on this, Japan and the Soviet Union may follow in the footsteps of Germany and the Soviet Union and sign a non-aggression treaty. Once this materializes, Japan's actions in the Far East against England will be free, in line with Germany's wishes. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Hong Kong: A Tokyo dispatch states that as a result of this morning's cabinet meeting, the Japanese government decided to protest to the German government regarding the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. The government also decided to proceed cautiously based on the new views expressed by the Chief Cabinet Secretary and formulate a new diplomatic policy. Some cabinet members urged Hiranuma to formulate a new diplomatic policy promptly based on the new views and to stop delaying. However, Hiranuma refused to respond to this. Observers attach great importance to Hiranuma's silence, as this is enough to indicate Hiranuma's attitude, namely that if the government wants to formulate a new policy, the internal front of Japan must first be reorganized, which is a prerequisite for determining the new policy. It is said that at today's cabinet meeting, cabinet members freely and frankly exchanged views on the various issues caused by German-Soviet friendship. (Dispatch, 15th)

London: The Daily Telegraph here recently published an editorial commenting on Japan's reaction after Germany and the Soviet Union established a non-aggression agreement, stating that "Japan's distress is not only due to Germany's escape, but also due to Germany conducting secret negotiations with the Soviet Union for several months, while also dealing with Japan. It is strange that the German diplomatic authorities did not see this. But as far as Japan is concerned, it should have been suspicious long ago, but it failed to notice it and ended up unhappily. As far as Germany is concerned, its assistance to China is far worse than Japan's accusations against England. This is why Japan is not comforted by the sweet words of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and has decided to adopt an isolationist policy. However, it is not yet known whether the Berlin-Rome axis has gained an ally or only a well-meaning neutral country because of the establishment of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. But the ally that has been lost is obvious." (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Tokyo: According to an army spokesman today, although Germany and the Soviet Union have established a non-aggression treaty, Japan will never change its anti-communist national policy. At the same time, the policy of establishing a "New Order in East Asia" has not changed in the slightest. In short, Japan's foreign policy will never follow others in the future and will continue to advance based on its established national policy. (Associated Press dispatch, 26th)

Tokyo: Regarding the fact that Germany, disregarding the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact and without consulting Japan first, concluded a five-power non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, newspapers here continue to criticize Germany today. According to the Chugai Business News, this is not a criticism of a resentful nature, because Germany has no moral values ​​at all and takes any cunning and despicable action on the grounds of protecting the existence of the country. It would be foolish for Japan to rebuke it. The Asahi Shimbun stated that under the current circumstances, it is impossible to adjust Soviet-Japanese relations because the Soviet Union has concluded a non-aggression treaty with Germany and will act freely in the Far East. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Tokyo: It was once rumored that General Osumi and General Terauchi, who were scheduled to attend the German National Socialist Party Congress, would temporarily postpone their trip to Germany due to the rapid changes in the European situation. As a result of discussions between the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the naval and land military authorities, it was decided to send the two generals to Germany as planned. This telegram was notified to the Japanese embassies in France and Italy on the 26th. (Domei dispatch, 26th)

Moscow - The staff meeting of the Anglo-Franco-Soviet military representatives has now concluded. The Anglo-French mission is scheduled to leave the country today. According to semi-official French sources, Marshal Voroshilov, the Soviet Minister of Defense, told the leaders of the Anglo-French mission that because the German-Soviet Pact has been concluded, the Soviet government believes that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union no longer serve a purpose and should not be continued. (Reuters, 26th)

A high-ranking official of the Soviet government stated that after the Supreme Soviet meeting to be held on Monday, the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, plans to depart for Berlin to meet with German authorities. (Associated Press, 26th)

General Smorochov, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Union, Vice Admiral Aravusov, Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, Mr. Bargov, Director of the Protocol Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, and many members of the British and French embassies saw them off at the station.

In addition, Italian expatriates in this port have all been ordered to leave, leaving only one consul and a few consular officials. The Italian ship "Infusoia" from the Italian port of Naples bound for New York, originally scheduled to stop briefly in this port, also temporarily canceled its plans. (Havas, 25th)

### British Foreign Office Responds to Ambassador Guo Regarding the Extradition of Four Chinese Nationals in Tianjin, This Action Should Not Be Considered as Recognition of the Puppet Government

London - Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, sent a note to the British government on August 12, protesting the British government's decision to hand over the four suspects in the Tianjin assassination case of Cheng to the Japanese. The British Foreign Office has now published an abstract of its reply to Ambassador Guo today. The reply clearly stated that the only reason the British government did not immediately agree to extradite the four criminals when the local court issued the arrest warrant was that the evidence presented at the time regarding the crime was insufficient. Subsequently, British and Japanese representatives began talks in Tokyo on July 24. During the talks, the Japanese side presented evidence, and the British government consulted the opinion of the highest legal experts, and decided that the preliminary hearing for the two criminals on charges of murder has been established, and the other two criminals have been charged with being members of an illegal terrorist group. The British government has always maintained that the case should be dealt with on its merits, and should not involve other disputes arising from the situation in Tianjin. As for using the defendants as hostages, or using them as a concession by the British government, it cannot be a problem. As for the handing over of these four people to the court, the Tianjin British Municipal Council now intends to hand over these four people to the court that has been a de facto court for the past two years for trial and to execute the arrest warrant issued by the court. This action seems to be no different from the hundreds of cases that have been executed previously. The Tianjin British Concession Municipal Authority has no other way to go. I am deeply convinced that after reflection, you will agree that, as stated in the letter, it is both infeasible and unreasonable to transfer these four people out of Tianjin against the opposition of the Japanese side and hand them over to a recognized Chinese authority elsewhere in China. At the same time, because these four people cannot be indefinitely detained without trial, there is no other way but to hand them over to the local authorities. As for the claim that the actions taken by the Tianjin British authorities in this case or similar cases in the past will constitute recognition of the so-called provisional government, the British government cannot agree to this statement. In fact, the government has not been recognized by the British government, nor, as far as we know, by any other government. Maintaining the neutrality of the Tianjin British Concession and not using it as a base for hostile actions has always been the aim of the British government. This attitude has been repeatedly explained to the Chinese government, such as the exchange of notes by the British Ambassador in July 1938 regarding the use of the Tianjin British Concession as a base for anti-Japanese activities and the guarantees that the Chinese government can give to prevent such activities from happening again. The British government, in view of its implication to the Japanese government (in the opinion of the British government, the preliminary hearing has been established), believes that it is no longer possible to refuse to hand over these four Chinese to the local Chinese authorities in Tianjin, and has already informed the British Municipal Council of this intention. (Reuters, 26th)

London - Chinese people here are deeply impressed by the announcement made by the British government regarding the four suspects detained in the Tianjin British Concession. The declaration stated that after consulting the opinion of the highest legal experts, the British government has decided that the preliminary hearing for two of the four criminals on charges of murder has been established, and the other two criminals have been charged with being members of an illegal terrorist group. Because the Chinese side has long had the impression that the British side will not extradite these four people, it is even more surprised by this declaration. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, has telegraphed Chongqing for instructions. At the same time, it is heard that the Chinese government has made a formal request to Sir Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, to hand over these four people to the Chinese government for handling, because according to the Treaty of Tianjin, the Chinese government is the only legitimate Chinese authority. It is claimed that the Aid China Movement Committee has entrusted its lawyer in Shanghai to re-apply for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, and it is heard that the lawyer will act as the direct representative of each criminal and act within the judicial jurisdiction of the Chinese government. (Reuters, 26th)

Manila - The German Hempel Company's motor ship "Kormoran" did not arrive here from Singapore at noon today, which is quite puzzling to the shipping industry.

During the crisis last September, the company's "Scharnhorst" disappeared for four days in a similar situation. It is believed that the "Kormoran" is now taking a similar strategy and awaiting orders from the authorities. (Reuters, 26th)

Wherever they pass, the countryside is being devoured. Local farmers still remember the locust plague of 1929, when crops in the Beiping area were completely wiped out. Therefore, they are now harvesting grains as quickly as possible. Temples east of Beiping are crowded with people praying to be spared from the locust plague. Five thousand refugees have already arrived here by train from the flooded areas, and at least 20,000 more are coming on foot. Providing them with shelter is causing the local authorities great concern, as food prices are rising, having doubled in the past week. According to Tianjin news, foreign authorities there believe the flooding will continue for three more months. They hope that the river will recede before freezing begins in early November, allowing Tianjin to pump out the accumulated water. Yesterday, the water level in Tianjin rose further due to continued rainfall. Cesspools in Tianjin have burst, emitting a foul odor, and many people with wounds who had to wade through the water have contracted gangrene. (Reuters, 26th)

### Since the Start of the War of Resistance, China's Public Debt Issuance Totals Approximately 3.67 Billion Yuan, Only One-Quarter of Japan's Debt Amount

Chongqing Correspondence: China's War of Resistance against Japan has been ongoing for over two years. Military expenditures are extremely vast, as the battle lines extend for five to six thousand li, and the number of soldiers fighting on the front lines reaches over two million. Expenditures must be very substantial, yet according to investigations, they are less than one-third of Japan's. China's average daily war expenditure is over 5 million yuan, while Japan's averages over 18.9 million yuan per day. At the end of the first phase of the War of Resistance, China's total expenditure for one and a half years was approximately 3 billion yuan. As of the second anniversary of the July 7th Incident, the total expenditure was around 4.5 billion yuan. Such a massive deficit cannot be sustained without constantly raising funds from various sources. In addition to reorganizing taxes, creating new taxes, issuing corresponding banknotes, controlling import and export trade, managing foreign exchange, promoting donations and savings, the issuance of public debt remains the only rapid method for raising war funds. According to a financial expert, the central and local government public bonds issued or borrowed since the start of the War of Resistance are listed as follows: (1) Central government domestic bonds include the 500 million yuan National Salvation Bonds issued in October of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], the 17 million yuan Guangdong Financial Consolidation Bonds issued in November of the same year, the Gold Bonds of 100 million taels of customs gold, 50 million US dollars, and 10 million British pounds issued in May of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], the 500 million yuan National Defense Bonds issued in the same month, the first batch of the 100 million yuan Relief Bonds, totaling 30 million yuan issued in July of the same year, the 600 million yuan Reconstruction Bonds issued in two installments on April 1st and August 1st of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], and the 600 million yuan Military Supplies Bonds issued in two installments on June 1st and October 1st. Among these, only the National Salvation Bonds issued in the early stages of the War of Resistance were directly and widely raised from the people, and even that was not fully subscribed. Most of the domestic bonds were underwritten by national banks. (2) Foreign debts borrowed by the central government include the 150 million French francs and 144,000 British pounds from a certain railway loan in April of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], two barter loans from the Soviet Union, each of 50 million US dollars in the same year, a British loan of 500,000 British pounds in December of the same year, a US loan of 25 million US dollars in the same month, and a second US loan of 12 million US dollars in the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939]. The total for the first two items is 356 million yuan, with domestic debt accounting for the absolute majority and foreign debt issuance being considerable as well. (3) Public bonds issued by local governments include the 5 million yuan Hubei Province Reconstruction Bonds issued in August of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], the 2.5 million yuan Shandong Province Land Consolidation Bonds issued in November of the same year, the 2 million yuan Anhui Province Highway Completion Bonds issued in the same month, the 15 million yuan Guangdong National Defense Bonds issued in March of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], the 1.8 million yuan Hunan Province Reconstruction Bonds issued in July of the same year, the 2 million yuan Gansu Province Reconstruction Bonds issued in the same month, the 5 million yuan Henan Province 6% Bonds, the 8 million yuan Fujian Province Reconstruction Bonds, the 10 million yuan Zhejiang Province 6% Bonds, the 8 million yuan Shaanxi Province Reconstruction Bonds issued in October of the same year, the 4 million yuan short-term treasury bills from the Guangdong Provincial Government Finance Department issued in January of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], and the Jiangsu Province Local Financial Consolidation Bonds and Guangxi Province 6% Bonds, each of 8 million yuan issued in April and May, totaling 100 million yuan. Compared to Japan, the total amount of public bonds scheduled to be issued in 1937 (314.4 million yen), 1938 (560 million yen), and 1939 (570 million yen), totaling 1.45 billion yen, is less than one-quarter. However, due to the limited absorption capacity of the people, Japan's public bonds scheduled for issuance over the past three years have had unsold remnants each year. In 1937, 92.9 million yen remained unsold, and in 1938, the unsold amount increased to over 220 million yen. This year's sales performance is expected to be even worse than last year due to the significant reduction in private inventory, the absence of the sharp increase in capital storage as last year, and the naturally declining absorption capacity for funds needed to expand production. Due to the poor absorption of public debt and the general shortage of materials, the Japanese government has been forced to issue a large amount of paper currency to meet its financial needs, leading to an inevitable malignant inflation.

### Japanese Troops Suffer Further Casualties in Jiangyin City and Countryside; Chinese Troops Active in Qiaozhi, South of the City

Jiangyin Correspondence: The area south of the city gate, about a li away, has been controlled by Chinese guerrillas. Japanese troops are stationed at the Shifang Temple and the Qian Clan Ancestral Hall. The day before yesterday, the Japanese troops at Shifang Temple were being redeployed when they were suddenly ambushed by guerrillas from Huashan, who opened fire and killed several Japanese soldiers before retreating. Additionally, the Xu Xiwu family in Qiaozhi Town was housing over twenty Japanese soldiers. The day before yesterday, three passing Japanese soldiers were loitering in West Street, forcibly taking vegetables, and were all annihilated by guerrillas. The Japanese troops in the Xu residence, unsure of the situation, hid in the iron house and did not dare to come out. Afterwards, they only conducted searches throughout the town for a long time, causing harm to several innocent villagers.

### Japanese Troops Use Shenzhen as a Base, Wildly Hope to Open the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Line; Japanese Aircraft Fly Over Hong Kong Airspace

Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the Japanese troops successively invaded Nantou and Shenzhen on the 16th, they have been rapidly launching large-scale operations since the 17th, continuously increasing their troops. Initially, they increased from 1,200 to nearly 3,000 soldiers, busily setting up fortifications. They used the Hong An Hotel in the market town as their headquarters and occupied the Guan Di Temple, the An Ren Charity Hall, the County Government, and the Tong Le Ju as barracks. They also set up a radio station in the Cai Neng Ji store. Most of the Japanese troops were distributed in the villages near Shenzhen, including Huangbeiling, Xiangdong, Xiangxi, Caiwuwei, Luohu (Chinese territory), and Hubei, with strict precautions. Subsequently, they increased their troops to over 10,000, with infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other types of soldiers equipped with dozens of tanks. Some of them were puppet troops. They immediately used Shenzhen as a base and advanced in three routes: (1) Straight along the Shenzhen-Henggang Highway towards Henggang and Longgang; (2) Attacking Shatoujiao along Wutong Mountain; (3) Attacking Lilang and Pinghu to the west along the railway. According to military intelligence on the 18th, fierce battles have broken out on all three routes. In addition, the Japanese troops in the Shilong area also launched attacks in coordination with the advance of Shenzhen troops, departing from Dongguan and Shilong to attack Zhangmutou from both sides, aiming to converge with the Japanese troops advancing west from Shenzhen and open the entire Guangzhou-Kowloon line. Battles have also occurred here. Judging from the Japanese's decisive actions, they are attempting to eliminate the guerrilla teams in Dongguan and Baoan counties, then attack Huiyang and Boluo before plotting to advance northward. Their plan is indeed vicious.

Battle Reports from Three Routes

The Japanese troops, consisting of approximately 500 infantry and cavalry, advancing northeast from Shenzhen, invaded Shatoujiao on the 17th. Because this area is the closest border between China and Britain and there are very few Chinese troops stationed there, the Japanese troops were able to occupy it leisurely that evening. Fortunately, the residents had already fled. After occupying Shatoujiao, the Japanese troops sent scouts to continue advancing towards Dapeng and Shayuchong, causing a very tense situation in Dapeng and Shayuchong. Local residents quickly evacuated. The Japanese troops advancing towards Longgang along the Shenzhen-Henggang Highway, approximately 500 in number, set out on the morning of the 17th and occupied Henggang. In the afternoon, a large force of approximately 1,000 soldiers, along with dozens of transport vehicles, arrived and gathered in Henggang. Several Japanese aircraft also patrolled and bombed Danshui and Huiyang all day. It is reported that the Fourth Column of the Chinese army under Chen Shengrong and the Third Column under Luo Kun, retreating along the highway, are defending the strategic locations near Longgang, forming a defensive position. They have already engaged with the Japanese troops. Chinese military authorities, believing that this area is close to Danshui and must be defended to protect the vanguard of Huiyang, have ordered Chen and Luo to respond cautiously and have deployed troops from Huiyang to reinforce the area. A major battle is expected to break out during the day. The morale in Huiyang city is stable, and everything is normal. The Japanese troops advancing directly along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway intend to open the Guangzhou-Kowloon line, so they deployed troops in two routes. One route, advancing west along the railway from Shenzhen, has been advancing towards Pinghu and Lilang with approximately 600 infantry, cavalry, and artillery, led by cavalry. The Chinese troops defending this area, the First Detachment of the Fourth Guerrilla Column under Yuan Huazhao, the Second Battalion under Wang Zuoyao, and the Eighth Security Regiment under Zhang Yu, encountered the Japanese troops in the Pinghu and Lilang area on the morning of the 18th and engaged in fierce battles. The Japanese troops used artillery fire to cover the advance of their infantry and cavalry. The Chinese troops defended bravely, and the battle situation was intense. The two armies are now in a stalemate. On the 17th, three Japanese aircraft flew to the Pinghu, Tangxia, and Shigut area and dropped bombs, likely to assist the Japanese troops' advance north.

Situation in Dongguan and Longgang

The Japanese troops in the Dongguan and Shilong area, to respond to the battle in the Pinghu area and to encircle the Chinese troops along the railway line, also deployed troops from Dongguan and Longgang to converge and attack Zhangmutou, attempting to occupy Zhangmutou and then sweep down the railway to meet with the Japanese troops advancing north from Shenzhen, realizing the ideal of completely connecting the Guangzhou-Kowloon line. It is reported that the Japanese troops in Dongguan and Longgang set out on the 17th. That evening, they advanced to the Tutang area west of Zhangmutou and encountered the Chinese troops, leading to battles. At 5:00 AM on the 18th, the Chinese Independent Detachment under Yuan Huazhao attacked from Dalang and engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese troops for approximately three hours, killing over forty Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army suffered over twenty casualties. According to military intelligence from Huiyang, the Japanese forces in the Zhangmutou area are not strong, and the Chinese army still has the advantage. However, Japanese warships were spotted on the sea off Huiyang on the 18th. That morning, approximately one hundred Japanese soldiers landed in Aotou in several speedboats and were discovered by the Chinese forces defending the area, who met them with fierce attacks. The remaining Japanese troops retreated back to their ships. The local situation is now stable, but residents have begun to evacuate to avoid unnecessary losses.

Situation in Hong Kong Territory

The Shenzhen Station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has been heavily guarded by the Japanese troops in recent days. Railway traffic has been blocked. Fortifications have been constructed with steel plates and barbed wire is spread everywhere. Japanese soldiers are stationed in the Wenjindu and Luohu area for guard duty. The Japanese flag is hoisted high at the Shenzhen Station. The customs checkpoint is guarded by Japanese soldiers. Pedestrians are not allowed to pass through Wenjindu. However, many refugees, having fled in a hurry with only their clothes on their backs, still risked sneaking in to inspect their devastated homes and fields. Their miserable and displaced state is unbearable to witness.

Also, Shatoujiao is an important road connecting China and Britain. The southern side of the same street belongs to British territory, and the northern side belongs to Chinese territory. When the Japanese troops occupied the area, the Hong Kong police authorities, ordered to deploy defenses on the border, dispatched New Territories Superintendent Parker to Shatoujiao on the Chinese side at 10:30 AM on the 17th to meet with Japanese Major Akita to explain everything, so that the Japanese troops understood the location of the Sino-British border. The situation in Wenjindu and Shatoujiao was such that although there was still a narrow passage for Sino-British traffic, pedestrians were absent. The weather was gloomy, with occasional light rain, making the scene even more bleak and desolate. The British and Indian troops guarding Shatoujiao were more numerous than in other areas, and their precautions were particularly tense.

At 9:10 AM on the 17th, twelve Japanese aircraft were spotted over Stanley in southern Hong Kong, flying from east to west towards the Tai O area. The Japanese aircraft flew in four groups of three, at an altitude of over 15,000 feet. The Hong Kong defense forces witnessed the passage of the Japanese aircraft but did not fire at them.

The waters of Ma Shi Wan and Deep Bay belong to British territory, while the land belongs to Baoan County in China. The coast in the Ma Shi Wan area includes Shatoujiao and Shayuchong, while the coast in the Deep Bay area includes Shekou, Shaxi Village, and Shatou. The coast is currently occupied by Japanese troops. Therefore, to protect its maritime borders, the Hong Kong military authorities dispatched two British warships on the 17th to patrol the area. Naval authorities issued a statement saying that the British warships HMS Scarab and HMS Mosquito were conducting exercises outside the harbor and have now been ordered to sail to Ma Shi Wan and Deep Bay to ensure the integrity of British territorial waters.

### The Special Significance of the First National Teachers' Day

— Lu Guanliu

The advocacy of Teachers' Day has been going on for several years. However, for the past few years, it has always been teachers singing their own praises. The national authorities have not officially recognized it, and people in society have not paid special attention to it. Every year when this day arrives, everyone follows the example of celebrating, either taking a day off or having a dinner, and it passes by time after time in a muddleheaded way.

This year's Teachers' Day had already passed, but according to the reports in the newspapers, Teachers' Day has been stipulated by the central government to be held on the day of Confucius's birthday. This is indeed a message that is worth paying attention to. We must not say that this is an ordinary thing. We must recognize the special and great significance it contains. The first question that floats in our minds is that the Teachers' Day, which has been advocated for many years, has never been approved by the authorities. Why is it that today, when difficulties are heavy, the central authorities, amidst the myriad tasks of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, have instead paid attention to the promotion of Teachers' Day? What is the reason for this? The answer is because the government attaches great importance to teachers. Now is the time when we are working hard to rejuvenate, and the responsibility of teachers is undoubtedly extremely great. The government's stipulation of Teachers' Day is to make us teachers recognize the importance of our responsibility, and to stand up and assume the important task of educating the people, inspiring conscience, and leading society.

The second question that floats in our minds is why Teachers' Day has been stipulated to be held on the day of Confucius's birthday. The answer is that Confucius is the greatest educator in our country's history. His words and deeds have had a very great impact on society and the country. Now, setting Teachers' Day on this day, on the one hand, makes people in society think of the respectability of teachers from the loftiness of Confucius's position. On the other hand, it makes teachers not underestimate their own profession, and be able to take Confucius as a role model to learn Confucius's good behavior. Confucius was a man more than two thousand years ago, and his thoughts and theories naturally have their own social background. It is certainly true that we, living in the age of scientific enlightenment in the twentieth century, should have newer thoughts and newer morals. However, Confucius's good morals still have many things worth imitating, especially now in the Shanghai educational community, at least the following advantages should be learned from him. The first is to learn Confucius's ability to distinguish right from wrong and to hate evil like an enemy. Confucius's theories start from a person's self-cultivation, and extend to governing the country and pacifying the world. He believed that the method for a person to cultivate themselves is to rectify the heart and make the intention sincere. He believed that a person whose heart is not rectified and whose intention is not sincere is a person without personality. He deeply hated people without personality because he hated evil like an enemy. Therefore, he started to kill Shao Zhengmao, a chaotic politician, less than seven days after becoming the Lu Sikou. The charge he killed Shao Zhengmao on was because he gathered crowds and formed societies, advocated heresies, and confused right and wrong. Therefore, he never tolerated Shao Zhengmao and killed him. He also wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals to praise good and criticize evil, with righteous words and strict definitions, so that ordinary chaotic ministers and traitors without personality would know what to be wary of. His spirit of being strict with right and wrong and hating evil like an enemy is what we should emulate.

The second is to learn Confucius's enthusiasm for education and willingness to take responsibility. Confucius was unable to realize his aspirations due to the constraints of the environment at that time. Therefore, he concentrated on teaching and instructing students. The main points of his teaching also focused on the cultivation of personal character. He had a spirit of enthusiasm for education, what is called "learning without satiety and teaching without weariness." He was also able to teach according to aptitude and carry out the work of popularizing education. Therefore, he said, "There is education without discrimination." Moreover, he not only taught students to learn, but also taught students to practice. Because of his enthusiasm for teaching, he had more than three thousand disciples, and many of them became famous later on. We, who are responsible for educating the next generation of citizens, should learn from Confucius's example, establish our own noble personality, be a role model for young students, and sow seeds of justice in the innocent minds of students.

The third is to learn Confucius's frugal life and strict moral conduct. Confucius referred to scholars as "shi" (士) and "junzi" (君子). The standard for "shi" was to have integrity, ability, and especially moral conduct. Therefore, he said, "Wealth and honor obtained through injustice are like floating clouds to me." His student Zizhang also said, "A shi gives his life when he sees danger, and thinks of righteousness when he sees gain." He also defined the meaning of "junzi" as "cannot be corrupted by wealth and honor, cannot be moved by poverty and lowliness, cannot be subdued by power and violence." Moreover, he was not only able to teach students this way, he was indeed able to do so himself. When he was traveling, he came to Chen and Cai. Because of the lack of travel expenses, he ran out of food for several days. The people who traveled with him all complained. He said, "We must be able to maintain our integrity when we encounter difficult times, and we must not abandon ourselves because of difficult times." Now, when teachers are generally in a state of expensive rice and firewood, meager income, and increasingly impoverished lives, his frugal and self-improving life is indeed worth emulating.

However, we should not just learn everything from Confucius and think that we are good enough. We must know that the current era is very different from thousands of years ago. The concept of loyalty to the emperor in the past must be replaced by the work of loving the country. The individual theories of the past must be replaced by collective actions. We must understand the mission given to us by this great era, and the future of our country and nation, and shoulder the responsibilities that every descendant of the Yellow Emperor should bear. Therefore, before this first National Teachers' Day, in addition to paying attention to personal cultivation, encouraging each other, and finding ways to strengthen personal will, we must also be able to actively unite so that everyone participates in the life of the organization, so that we can jointly move towards a bright future.

### Confucius's Birthday and Teachers' Day to be Commemorated Separately; Confucius's Birthday Commemoration Still to be Held According to Original Regulations

Chongqing, 15th: This year's Teachers' Day commemoration will be held separately because the central government decided that the Teachers' Day ceremony will not be incorporated into the Confucius's Birthday commemoration ceremony. The Executive Yuan has now ordered the Ministry of Education that, before the Teachers' Day commemoration ceremony and program have been approved, this year's Teachers' Day commemoration should be held separately, and the Confucius's Birthday commemoration should still be held according to the original regulations.

### Public Works Department Subsidy for Private Schools: Teacher Stipends and Free Tuition for Impoverished Students Deadline for Requests: 15th

In consideration of the high cost of living in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Council has specially stipulated within the 1939 subsidy funds for several private schools that a portion will be used as stipends for teachers' living expenses and free tuition for impoverished students. This is intended to provide some additional assistance to impoverished teachers beyond their original salaries, and to prevent some students from impoverished families from dropping out of school. The Public Works Department also stipulates that each school must submit teachers' receipts and signed forms from parents of free tuition students for verification, in order to ensure credibility. Furthermore, the Public Works Department's 1940 subsidy request forms have been distributed since the 25th of last month. The deadline for these requests is September 15th. Consequently, the number of people filling out subsidy forms has been unusually crowded recently.

### Open Swimming All Concluded: Lu Shungen Loses to Lugen in 220 Yards; Lin Meiling and Wu Jiahua Also Suffer Miserable Defeats Yesterday

The final four events of the open swimming competition were held last night at the Rowing Club. Lu Shungen participated while ill in the 120-yard freestyle, losing to Lugen by half a body length. The Rowing Club pool is over 33 yards long, so it requires swimming six laps and twenty yards. When turning at the last lap, Shungen was still slightly ahead, but unexpectedly suffered a miserable defeat at the finish line. The time was 1 minute 39.4 seconds, which is more than 10.2 seconds slower than the highest record. Wu Gansheng and Zhong Shoujun were absent from the 200-yard breaststroke, and only three people participated. Hall performed butterfly style throughout, with a time of 2 minutes 50.2 seconds, which was only slightly better than Griepp's 2 minutes 52 seconds in the preliminary round. Wu Jiahua was able to compete in the middle, but later failed due to exhaustion. In the women's 50-yard backstroke, Miss Lin Meiling also suffered a miserable defeat. All eighteen men's and women's events of the Shanghai Open Swimming Competition have now been completed. Yesterday's results are as follows:

### Anti-Sweeping War Imminent in Shanghai Suburbs; Chinese Troops Have Made Thorough Preparations; Regular Troops Stationed in Shang, Song, Qing Counties; Jiangnan Guerrilla Area Prepares for Mobile Warfare

The Central Government is actively mobilizing a large number of regular troops to the counties in the Jiangnan Guerrilla Area, planning large-scale mobile warfare in preparation for recovering lost territory. It is believed that in view of the chaotic situation of mixed troops in the counties on the outskirts of Shanghai, it is urgent to reorganize them. The Military Commission has ordered General Liu Jianxu to appoint Zhang Luanji, the commander of the newly formed 30th Division, to be responsible for the reorganization. It is heard that the counties near Shanghai will be divided into four major districts, namely Shanghai City, Shang-Song-Qing, Feng-Nan-Chuan, and Tai-Jia-Bao, etc. Military commissioners with military talent will be appointed to each county and district to conduct practical training locally, in order to create a strong and effective force and launch anti-sweeping guerrilla warfare. The 30th Division has made thorough preparations and has dispatched the entire 88th Regiment of Tian Xiushan to be stationed in Shang, Song, and Qing counties. Rumors that the 33rd and 34th Divisions are opening in Shanghai may be a misunderstanding of this.

Japanese Troops in Nanhui Request a Delay in Military Action: The Ogawa unit of the Japanese army that invaded Nancheng and Datuan is facing difficulties in military action because there are no roads in the area, and the suburbs are controlled by guerrillas, threatening their retreat. Therefore, the Japanese side has released peaceful overtures, requesting that the guerrillas cease military operations, and promising to return to Nanhui City and Datuan Town, continuing to collect various national taxes as usual, and that neither side will attack again, which is equivalent to signing a non-aggression pact. Chinese military commanders such as Yu Taosheng believe that this is a delaying tactic and have ignored it, launching large-scale encirclement tactics.

Japanese Army Reinforcements on the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway: According to people from Qingpu, there have been continuous guerrilla battles on the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway, and the Japanese army has sent many reinforcements in an attempt to carry out their so-called sweeping plan. However, the guerrillas are familiar with the roads, and the Japanese army cannot find them, so this plan to advance and drive the Chinese troops to the west of the Song-Qing Highway has completely failed.

Japanese Navy Landings and Searches on the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road: The Shanghai Middle School, North Bridge Town, and the towns of Longhua, Meilong, and Xinzhuang on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway were originally garrisoned by only a dozen to dozens of Japanese troops. Now, because the guerrilla forces are active in various places, the Japanese side has gradually tightened its defenses. According to people who came to Shanghai from Minhang yesterday, the number of Japanese troops stationed along the way has increased. Sentries have been stationed in Yanpu Town, and the Japanese Navy has landed to conduct searches. A curfew has also been imposed in Zhuanqiao and Xinzhuang areas to prevent guerrillas from attacking the Japanese headquarters.

### Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance to Expand the Use of Remittances; Payment of Rent and Goods Must Not Be Refused; The Aim Is to Eliminate Premiums and Facilitate Circulation

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on the requests of 104 industries in the city, cabled the Ministry of Finance to request the elimination of remittance premiums and to promote the use of remittances for paying rent and various goods not purchased with foreign exchange. The requests from various industries and the Chamber of Commerce's telegram are recorded below:

Requests from Various Industries:

There are a total of 104 trade associations with seals, including: pharmaceutical industry, silk industry, cotton cloth industry, letterpress printing industry, hotel industry, knitting industry, department store industry, freight car industry, electrical appliance industry, stationery industry, sausage industry, cattle and sheep raw leather industry, fur, oil, and bone industry, tin printing and canning industry, thermos bottle manufacturing industry, biscuit, candy, canned food, and bread industry, restaurant industry, sugar industry, Chaozhou sugar and sundry goods industry, paraffin wax industry, copper and tin industry, shipping industry, glass industry, electrical machinery and silk weaving factory industry, wool and velvet textile industry, yarn and flower shop industry, cotton shop industry, western dye industry, flour mill industry, medicinal material industry, machinery dyeing and weaving industry, paper industry, foil industry, oil pressing factory industry, hardware and used goods industry, hardware parts industry, paint industry, foreign tea industry, firewood and charcoal industry, machinery coal briquette industry, Chinese medicine industry, tobacco exchange industry, timber industry, real estate industry, remnant cloth industry, fresh pig slaughtering industry, cosmetics industry, Chinese and foreign sundry goods industry, coal industry, coal and stone barge industry, eyeglasses industry, watch and clock industry, rice milling industry, bamboo industry, foreign straw hat industry, pawnshop industry, pawnshop industry, shoe leather nail shoe last industry, Qinglan cloth dyeing shop industry, garment industry, yarn, thread, and sock dyeing industry, calligraphy, painting, stationery, and fan shop industry, utensil industry, silk and satin dyeing shop industry, cattail bag industry, silk and cotton industry, lantern industry, cotton ginning industry, gray dyeing shop industry, foreign printing, bleaching, and dyeing cloth industry, rubber products industry, gold industry, fashion industry, hat export industry, woolen fabric industry, rice shop industry, gas lamp factory industry, leather goods industry, purchasing cloth and sundry goods industry, coal ash factory industry, color printing industry, steel bar and scrap iron industry, local goods industry, seafood and sundry goods industry, tobacco industry, tea industry, antique industry, ham industry, tea industry, bleaching and finishing socks industry, fresh medicine industry, construction factory industry, dull yarn dyeing industry, and new medicine industry.

Chamber of Commerce Telegram:

To the Ministry of Finance, Chongqing (omitted ten lines). It is found that the current inter-trade remittance method is implemented according to the Ministry of Finance's June telegram. For deposits of less than 500 yuan, legal tender is paid. For those over 500 yuan, legal tender is paid for 500 yuan, and inter-trade remittances are paid for the remainder. Otherwise, legal tender of 500 yuan is paid per week. Originally, it was hoped that this would save legal tender and facilitate commercial circulation. Therefore, remittances must have the same effect and price as legal tender to prevent merchants from having to discount at high prices for purchasing materials and making payments, resulting in more losses and affecting prices, which are soaring day by day. The request of the associations to expand the use of remittances is actually a countermeasure to eliminate discounting. It is proposed that a clear order be issued that the other party must not refuse to accept remittances for the payment of rent and various goods that are not related to foreign exchange, so that the scope of circulation is wider and the commercial circulation is more abundant. The urgency of waiting for orders is overwhelming. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully requests approval.

### Xian Rice Prices Have Fallen; Yu Qiaqing Plans to Advance 300,000 Yuan to Order Foreign Rice; If Necessary, 1 Million Yuan Can Be Raised

Yesterday, the price of white japonica rice in the rice market did not change, while the price of xian rice dropped sharply by about two yuan. According to rice industry insiders, a large amount of Jiangbei rice has arrived in the Pujiang River and is parked at the Qichang Wharf area, not yet across the river. Early rice in Gaoqiao, Pudong, is already ripe. The fullness of the ears of rice and the plumpness of the grains are enough to show a good harvest year. However, it is still early, and the rice grains are not yet firm. In general, villagers are unable to purchase rice due to the high price, so they have to harvest it early for their own consumption. A large number of these new rice grains are broken after being milled by the mill. According to local farmers, a large amount of production will occur in another week. Now, because they are forced by the market price, they have to reluctantly harvest early, which is out of necessity. Observing the current situation, rice prices will gradually decline and will not have unexpected market conditions again.

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that, according to a senior official of the Public Works Department, the Public Works Department has requested the cooperation of the Japanese side to allow rice and food to be more freely transported into the two concessions. The Japanese authorities have not yet responded, but the hope for an early response and assistance from the Japanese side remains strong. If the Japanese side provides assistance, the current serious situation can be greatly reduced.

Ordering Foreign Rice: Letter Requesting Registration:

Yu Qiaqing and others sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating that since the source of rice for food in the city has become difficult, the price of rice has soared. The high selling price has created an unprecedented record in the history of Shanghai. According to a recent survey, the amount of rice stored in Shanghai is insufficient compared to the number of households in the city. If the upper and middle class citizens do not come up with a proper solution, they will inevitably compete to buy rice at high prices, and the poor will face the danger of starvation in the near future. If this estimate becomes a reality, not only will the trend of grabbing rice inevitably follow, but the municipal political stability will be unimaginable. In view of this, in order to prepare for a rainy day, we have launched the Shanghai People's Food Maintenance Association to handle the registration and order foreign rice. If the upper and middle class citizens can have their own preparations, they will not compete with the poor for food, and the rising price of rice may be stopped and gradually calmed down. Therefore, our move will not only ensure that those who join the association to order foreign rice will not have to worry about running out of rice, but also help the poor. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be done by a small number of people. It requires the joint efforts of people from all walks of life to achieve optimistic results. We hereby send a special letter to your association, asking you to forward it to the trade associations, informing their members to rise up and go to the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association to register and order. When the news spreads, people's hearts will be at ease, and it will be beneficial to the public, which is not insignificant. Your association has always been enthusiastic about public welfare for the citizens, and we hope that you will be happy to comply with our request and see it through together. Sincerely, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Yu Qiaqing, Gui Yanfang, Guo Shun, Zhang Jiguang, Wang Yuqing, and others.

Registration Orders Reach 800 Bags:

A reporter from Daguang News Agency learned from the Certified Public Accountants Association yesterday that since the initiators Yu Qiaqing and others entrusted the association to handle the registration of foreign rice orders, yesterday, the following requested to order: (1) Chinese Mental Hospital 50 bags, (2) Huisheng Match Printing Factory 50 bags, (3) Chunhe, Yong Woolen Cloth Shop 50 bags, (4) Yixin Educational Supplies Store 50 bags, (5) Hongtai Shop 50 bags, (6) Qiaomao Cold Steam Company 100 bags, (7) Siming Hospital 100 bags, (8) Yuxin Baoji Stationery Store 50 bags, totaling 500 bags. The total number of orders placed before yesterday has reached 800 bags. It is also understood that the member banks of the Bankers Association and the money shops of the Money Shop Association have begun to handle the procedures for purchasing foreign rice and will complete the purchase in the next few days. Once the total number is collected, it will be registered with the Certified Public Accountants Association.

Designated Banks to Collect Rice Payments:

In addition, Gui Yanfang told a Daguang News Agency reporter that the purpose of initiating the purchase of foreign rice this time is to relieve the food shortage of Shanghai citizens, so as to make the inventory sufficient and suppress the rise in rice prices. All rice purchase funds have been advanced by the initiator Yu Qiaqing, totaling 300,000 yuan. If necessary, 1 million yuan can be raised. All industries that entrust the purchase of foreign rice must pay half of the rice price in advance and request the Zhejiang Industrial Bank to collect it on behalf of the organization, which will issue a receipt.

Rice Grab in Pudong Intensifies:

The rice grabbing trend in Pudong is intensifying. At around 9:00 PM the night before last, dozens of poor men and women, holding cloth bags or rice baskets, broke open the door of Yuan Lai Rice Shop at No. 78 Land Temple in Yangjiazhai and grabbed 900 empty rice bags, 10 yuan in legal tender, 7 dan of broad beans, and 30 short shirts and pants. Also, Wu Tai Rice Shop on Dongchang Road was stormed by 70 or 80 men, women, and children, who, unable to buy rice, grabbed dozens of bags of flour. The local "organization" organized a sale at a fair price to cover up the rice grabbing trend.

### Implementing Direct Property Tax; Inheritance Tax to Be Levied; Implementation of Separate Collection and Receipt; Effective Date of the Public Treasury Law Has Been Decided

After the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Inheritance Tax with 24 articles on October 6, 1938, the Ministry of Finance, considering this tax to be an important backbone in the direct tax system, prepared a draft of the Implementing Regulations on Inheritance Tax in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations and submitted it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. It is currently being deliberated by the Legislative Yuan and will be formulated and promulgated in the near future. It has now been decided to levy the tax on a scheduled basis after the formulation and promulgation of the Implementing Regulations. As for the matters that should be prepared, such as the uniform investigation of property owner names and the registration of household registration, they are all being promoted in preparation for implementation. As for the most burdensome inheritance evaluation method for collecting inheritance tax, as well as the forms used for collection, draft plans have been formulated. In the future, the implementation methods will be carried out in phases and regions.

Public Treasury Law Has Been Scheduled for Implementation:

The essence of the independent system of separation of collection and receipt is that the tax authorities are only responsible for collection, while the banks acting as public treasuries are responsible for receiving tax payments and directly depositing them into the public treasury. They are independent of each other. Now, after the Ministry of Finance has taken into account the actual situation, it has decided on the effective date and area: (1) The National Treasury, except for Xinjiang, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces, which will be postponed for the time being, and those guerrilla areas or areas close to the war zone where there are special obstacles in fact, which will be temporarily adapted by the public treasury authorities, will be implemented from October 1st of this year; (2) Provincial, municipal, and county treasuries will be implemented from January 1, 1940. Remote provinces and counties or areas with special circumstances may report their difficulties to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for consideration and postponement before January 1, 1940, and implemented on April 1, 1940, or July 1, 1940.

Establishing Training Institute to Promote New Taxes:

The purpose of establishing the Central Direct Tax Personnel Training Class is to use new talents to handle new taxes, as a cadre to promote new taxes, and to quickly lay a solid foundation for the tax system. Since its establishment, it has achieved remarkable results. The Ministry of Finance has taken a further step to promote the spirit of this examination and training by setting up a Financial Personnel Training Institute to conduct large-scale training, in order to complete the mission of thoroughly reforming the personnel aspects of financial administration. The institute is divided into senior and junior levels, and each level is divided into tax, accounting, statistics, and banking groups. The senior groups require a bachelor's degree in economics, finance, accounting, banking, or commerce, while the junior groups require a degree from a vocational school, senior commercial school, or senior high school. After completing the training, they will be assigned to serve in various financial and tax agencies and the Central Bank. The third phase has recruited 200 senior students and 100 junior students.

### Britain and France Increase the Number of Main Battle Ships; Arriving in the Far East to Increase Defenses; Equipped with 13.5-Inch to 15-Inch Guns; British Ship Mofu Studies in the Chuandiao Strait

With the European situation tense, Hong Kong is in a state of war, and the financial market is almost at a standstill. Women and children of various countries have also been ordered to prepare for evacuation. It is rumored that more than 10,000 Japanese troops have been concentrated in Shenzhen, which faces Kowloon across the sea. In addition to closing the Li Yu Men port, the Hong Kong authorities will also close the Ye Xi Kou Jishui Men. The British fleet stationed in Hong Kong goes out to sea from time to time. It is heard that in order to protect British interests in the Far East, the British government will continue to transfer a strong British main battle fleet to the Far East for defense in the near future. These battle ships are all equipped with large guns ranging from 13.5 inches to 15 inches in diameter. At least four to six battle ships will be transferred to the Far East, and Singapore and Hong Kong will be used as bases. According to the Hong Kong naval authorities, the British ship "Mofu" is scheduled to practice in the East Boliao Strait on the 24th and 25th of this month, firing main guns with a diameter of 6 inches. The target is the lower tail bay opposite Boliao Island, and several torpedo boats will shuttle back and forth. The British aircraft carrier "Eagle" rushed back from Singapore to Hong Kong to assist in defense.

### America's Shortest Shortwave Machine; Broadcasting to the Far East; Shanghai Time Is 4:00 AM Midnight

### British Naval Commander Maule Goes to Weihaiwei Aboard HMS Cornflower, Sailing North for Patrol; Huth's Private Yacht to Sail to Qingdao Today

Amidst the tense situation in Shanghai, the movements of British warships have become increasingly frequent, a matter that deserves considerable attention. The cruiser HMS Cornflower, berthed at the British naval pontoon, suddenly weighed anchor and sailed out at 4:30 PM on the 25th, replaced by the new British "D" class destroyer HMS Duncan. It is learned that after leaving the naval pontoon, the Cornflower sailed north at 5:00 PM, carrying Rear Admiral Maule, commander of the British Fifth Destroyer Flotilla, to Weihaiwei for patrol. Furthermore, Rear Admiral Huth, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet's private yacht, the "Isabel," has completed inspection at the naval dockyard and sailed to the sea for a test voyage on the 25th. The results were reportedly excellent, and the ship returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is rumored that the ship is scheduled to sail to Qingdao today to meet with Rear Admiral Huth, who is currently inspecting Qingdao, to await orders.

### People from Hong Kong Come to Shanghai in Succession, All Ships Fully Loaded with Passengers; Evacuees Also Return to Shanghai

The relationship between Germany and Poland is becoming increasingly tense, and the European situation is extremely dangerous. War is on the verge of breaking out. According to sources in the shipping industry, there has been a significant increase in the number of passengers coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong in the past three days. Ships arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong are fully loaded with Chinese and Western passengers, mostly women and children. This is because Hong Kong is deeply concerned about

the outbreak of war

and is making strong preparations for war. Therefore, Chinese and Western merchants in Hong Kong are sending their families to Shanghai to avoid accidents. It is reported that the cost of living there is even higher than in Shanghai. When the Hong Kong dollar was at its highest, it was worth 4.40 yuan in legal tender.

Although it has fallen slightly

it still requires 3.70 yuan in legal tender, three times more expensive than a year ago. All expenses are calculated in Hong Kong dollars, which invisibly increases the price significantly. Many wealthy people from various war zones in the country went to Hong Kong to take refuge after the war, and their living expenses have been increasing daily.

Most Feeling Painful

are now returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong to reduce their burden. The current situation in Hong Kong is very stable. Although there are many rumors and the situation is slightly tense after the Japanese army occupied Shenzhen, people's hearts are extremely calm and composed. The authorities are making strong preparations for war and are determined to defend Hong Kong Island.

### Tram Fare Tickets Restricted in Issuance, Circulation Exceeds 50,000 Yuan; Fractional Tickets to Be Recalled Immediately

The two concession tram companies in this city previously issued a type of tram fare ticket due to the extreme shortage of copper coins. Because these fare tickets were more convenient to use than postage stamps, the market mostly refused to use postage stamps and used these fare tickets for payment, resulting in a phenomenon of demand exceeding supply. To date, the tram fare tickets in circulation on the market amount to more than 50,000 yuan. It is now learned that the tram company is restricting the issuance of fare tickets because the Central Bank's fractional currency notes are about to be issued. Passengers without tram fare tickets will not be given change when purchasing tickets and will be stopped from purchasing tickets, forcing them to get off the tram.

### Cruise Ships Arrive in Shanghai; Italian Ship Stops at Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf, Carrying Over 600 Jewish People

The British Company's regular mail ship, the "Kassaiqi" (transliteration), came to Shanghai from London earlier this month on its way to Japan. It is now scheduled to return to Shanghai today, arriving at 1:00 PM and berthing at pontoons 11 and 12. It is scheduled to weigh anchor and return to Europe next Tuesday (the 29th) at 2:00 PM. This ship has 31 passengers on its return trip from Japan. After arriving in Shanghai, they will transfer to a smaller boat prepared by the company and land at the New Customs Wharf around 1:00 PM. Furthermore, the American President Lines' President Cleveland arrived in Shanghai from Los Angeles on the 17th of this month and sailed to Hong Kong and Manila. It is now learned that the ship has returned from Manila and passed Hong Kong yesterday. It is scheduled to arrive at the port at noon tomorrow (the 28th) and berth at pontoons 12 and 13. The company has prepared the "Scott" small boat to depart from the New Customs Wharf at 12:30 PM tomorrow to pick up passengers. The passengers will land at the New Customs Wharf at 2:00 PM. The large ship is scheduled to weigh anchor at 7:00 AM on the 29th and sail to Japan, passing through Honolulu and San Francisco before returning to Los Angeles. The small boat "Scott" is scheduled to depart from the New Customs Wharf at 1:00 AM on the 29th (i.e., midnight on the 28th). Furthermore, the Italian Mail Ship Company's Far East Express Line's "Conte Rosso" and "Conte Verde" are scheduled to enter the dock for repairs after returning to Europe. The "Giuliana" (transliteration) from the North Africa Line will replace one trip. This ship came to Shanghai once in mid-May of this year and is now making its second trip. It is scheduled to arrive at the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf in Hongkou at 10:00 AM tomorrow. The company's disembarkation procedures for passengers remain the same as before. Foreigners will disembark at the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf, while Chinese passengers will transfer to a small boat to reach the New Customs Wharf at noon. It is rumored that this ship will again carry over 600 Jewish people, who will stay in Shanghai for two days and then depart on the 30th, returning to Venice via Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. The next trip may not come to Shanghai because the "Conte Verde" will be repaired and return to service in Shanghai.

### Coal Ball Guild Discusses Trade Methods, Market Arrival Is Extremely Crowded, Market Price Suppression Situation Improves

The coal market situation has improved due to the arrival of various goods and the suppression of prices. The Rong gang is active, and more goods have been added to this street, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of transactions. However, the large-scale shipment of foreign coal to Shanghai and the outflow of resources are indeed noteworthy. Hongji coal powder has not continued to rise, and the cost of the coal ball industry has been reduced. The Coal Ball Guild has discussed the trade methods for the industry: (1) The wholesale price of coal balls produced by each factory shall be 62 yuan in national currency; (2) The retail price per dan (calculated at 100 city catties) shall be 3.40 yuan in national currency; (3) The delivery fee per ton shall be 1.60 yuan in national currency; (4) New stack orders shall be temporarily suspended from today; (5) Outstanding stack orders shall be notified by each factory to customers to clear them within a time limit; (6) Delivery vehicles for returned coal powder shall not be brought back to the factory on behalf of customers; (7) If the returned coal powder is delivered to each factory by customers and found to be dry and free of mixed debris, coal balls shall be exchanged at 80% of the price.

This is the second flag-flying day after the flag-flying dispute (the first flag-flying day was the anniversary of the establishment of the National Government). Companies, businesses, households, schools, etc. in the city originally intended to fly the flag for one day to show their celebration, but due to the current situation, or for fear of misunderstandings, the police authorities of the concessions notified various businesses, etc. at around 5:00 PM yesterday, hoping to stop the flag-flying activity.

Member Bank

The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, the courts of all levels in the two concessions, the Jianghai Customs, the post office, schools, factories, and various associations will all be closed today in accordance with the national holiday for one day, but even though it is a Sunday, there will be no make-up holiday tomorrow and they will remain open for normal operations and business.

### Famous American Writer Arrives in Shanghai; Impression of the Garden Bridge; Expresses Emotion at the Sight of Chinese Forced to Bow, Says If They Were Americans, They Would Harbor Hatred for Life

Author of "How to Win Friends and Influence People"

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that Dale Carnegie, the famous author of "How to Win Friends and Influence People," arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 25th) after traveling in Japan. A reporter interviewed him today (the 26th) and asked what he had noticed during his brief time in Shanghai. Carnegie said that if the Chinese people bowing to Japanese sentries at the Garden Bridge were Americans, they would harbor hatred for the Japanese for life. Self-esteem is dynamite. If you strike a person's self-esteem, you cannot influence them with friendship. He does not know how Orientals feel or react when forced to bow, but he knows how Americans would feel if they encountered this.

Short Stay, Scheduled to Return to America

Carnegie did not attempt to influence the Japanese while in Japan. He said that he was not proficient in Japanese and could not do anything about it. Carnegie also said that he saw few signs of war on his trip to China from Japan, and that he felt this trip was much safer and more comfortable than driving from New York to Chicago. He will stay in Shanghai briefly, planning to buy some goods and sightsee, and then buy a ticket back to Chicago on Wednesday.

Refuses to Criticize German-Soviet Pact

When asked by a reporter about the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, Carnegie refused to criticize it. He said that he felt he was not qualified to talk about international relations. He himself has some small problems and does not know how to solve them, so how can he express opinions on these world events? He felt honored to be asked these questions, but he believed that news reporters were more qualified to talk about these events than he was.

Unwilling to Discuss, Be Friends with Japan

The reporter asked Carnegie for tips on how Britain could try to befriend Japan. Carnegie said that he hoped the reporter would tell him. He felt that he was only qualified to talk about three things he had studied: one was public speaking, which he had studied for 25 years and written a book about; two was the life and experiences of Lincoln, which he had studied for three years and written a biography of Lincoln;

New Book Success, Great Surprise

Third, he spent fifteen years studying human relations and wrote "How to Win Friends and Influence People." He was truly surprised by the success of this book, because in Carnegie's opinion, his efforts in writing this book were less than those in the biography of Lincoln. However, others felt interested in the book, which is a good reason for it to be widely circulated. As a result of Carnegie's study of public speaking, he is currently planning to write another book, "How to Develop Self-Confidence and Overcome Fear," but he always finds it difficult to start writing, so he cannot say for sure when it will be published.

### Inspection of Imported Goods Is Customs' Authority; Local Authorities May Not Arbitrarily Detain Goods

The Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed the governments of all provinces, saying, "Approved is the telegram from the Ministry of Finance, according to the report from the Inspector General of Customs transferred by the Zhejiang Customs, stating that local authorities in Zhenhai want to inspect Chinese and foreign merchant ships and civilian ships according to the regulations for prohibiting Japanese goods, and have already occurred incidents of detaining ships and goods. The Ningbo local authorities are also about to adopt the same actions, etc. The Ministry requests verification and handling of the above. It is found that imported goods have always been inspected by the Customs before the ships and goods leave. Therefore, according to the provisions of Article 3 of the Prohibition Regulations, regarding the inspection and detention of Japanese goods entering through Customs checkpoints, it is within the authority of the Customs. As for Japanese goods that have already been imported or transferred to the interior after import, the inspection, identification, registration, and disposal matters shall be the responsibility of the local competent authorities, and the goods detained by the Customs shall still be sent to the local competent authorities for disposal. Hereafter, all local authorities must comply with the regulations when prohibiting Japanese goods and shall not arbitrarily inspect and detain imported goods that have not been unloaded to avoid disturbances."

### Divorced Couple in Litigation

The woman accuses the man of embezzlement. Zhao Lianyang, a woman from Yuyao, is 30 years old this year and has an attractive appearance. Ten years ago, she was married to Zheng Yanling, a Ningbo native who runs the Weishun Knitting Factory at No. 1 Shunchang Lane, Wangzhi Road, through a matchmaker. The couple's relationship was initially harmonious, but later, Zhao became restless and committed adultery with her brother-in-law, Fan Bingxing. Zheng discovered this, and Zhao wrote a letter of repentance. The couple reunited. In May of last year, Zhao again committed adultery with Cui Xiangshun, a traveling salesman at her husband's knitting factory, and was again discovered by Zheng. Zhao requested to be allowed to write another letter of repentance, and Zheng was unwilling to pursue the matter and allowed Zhao to renew herself. Unexpectedly, Zhao's lascivious heart did not diminish. In the autumn of last year, she again committed adultery with Cui Xiangshun. Therefore, Zheng reported to the French Concession Police, who detained Zhao and sent her to the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, where she was sentenced to four months in prison. The case has been finalized. Later, the two parties were involved in litigation, and a judgment was made allowing the two parties to divorce. Recently, Zhao again hired lawyer Yu Hualong to file a complaint with the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Zheng Yanling of embezzling over 2,300 yuan in savings. The case was heard by Judge Miao Qingbang in the Fifth Criminal Court at approximately 3:00 PM yesterday. Zhao Lianying and Zheng Yanling both appeared in court in person. They each held their own views in court. Zhao insisted that Zheng embezzled the 2,300 yuan in savings, while Zheng said that he did have the savings, but had handed them over to the plaintiff in May of last year. After verifying the statements, the court decided to reschedule the hearing for September 5 to summon witnesses and subpoena documents for further questioning.

### German Ships Stop Sailing to Japanese Ports; One British Ship Has Been Requisitioned by the British Government

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that the Blue Funnel Line's regular ship, the Antenor, carrying passengers from Shanghai, has been requisitioned by the British government. Furthermore, the Far East has seen another sign of the impact of current political developments, namely that ships of the German Rickmers Line (transliteration) have announced that they will not sail to Japanese ports. It is noted that the Antenor left Shanghai several days ago and sailed from Hong Kong on Wednesday. It is not yet known whether it was requisitioned at sea or upon reaching Singapore, but it is heard that passengers will disembark in Singapore. Although Rickmers Line ships do not sail to Japan, German ships of the Norddeutscher Lloyd and Hamburg America Line have not changed their scheduled routes and continue to sail to Japanese ports.

### Tianjin Flood; Shanghai Ships Plan to Sail to Dalian; Navigation Channels Unrecognizable, Likely to Be Forced to Suspend Navigation; Wusong Estuary Water Level Also Especially High

The foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Tianjin route, including the Xin Anna, Xin Anfu, Xin Xiangtai, Hongshun, An Sui, Xin An, Tai Shun, Sheng Jing, etc., have all sailed from Shanghai to Tianjin one after another in recent days. According to telegrams received by American firm Wilh. Wilhelmsen and others, Tianjin has been experiencing heavy flooding for days, especially in the Japanese Concession, with the deepest areas reaching over 13 feet and the shallowest areas being over three feet. The severity of the flood is even greater than the Hankou flood of 1931, making it impossible for foreign ships to berth and unload passengers and cargo. Furthermore, the Hai River banks from Tanggu to Zizhu Forest are completely submerged, making it almost impossible to identify the navigation channels, so navigation is extremely difficult.

Ships Temporarily Docked at Dagu and Tianjin

After sailing from Shanghai to Tianjin one after another, the Xin Anna and other ships were unable to berth and unload cargo due to the heavy flooding. In addition to telegraphing their respective companies for instructions, they have all temporarily docked at Dagu and Tianjin Zizhu Forest. The Xin Anna, Xin Anfu, and Hongshun are docked at Dagu, while the Xin Antai, An Sui, and Xin Xiangtai are docked at Zizhu Forest. The Hongyun Shipping Bureau, Wilh. Wilhelmsen, Taichangxiang Steamship Company, and Weitai Steamship Company have all published announcements stating that the ships will sail to nearby Dalian to unload cargo, but are awaiting notification from the passenger and cargo owners. A decision will be made at 2:00 PM on the 28th on whether to sail to Dalian or return to Shanghai.

Shanghai-Tianjin Route to Be Temporarily Suspended

According to shipping industry sources, due to the heavy flooding in Tianjin, the ships are unable to berth and unload cargo, and the losses from being stranded at Dagu or Tianjin are quite large. Therefore, if the flood does not recede, the ships may be forced to temporarily suspend operations and change to other routes, and will resume operations after the flood has receded. However, it is heard that the Swire Shipping's Shuntian and Shengjing ships may still be operating.

Yangtze River Banks Damaged

The Yangtze River water level is still flooding. Recently, ships traveling along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, such as those passing through Jiaoshan and Madang, have not dared to navigate at night. It is heard that many of the riverbanks have been damaged, making navigation extremely difficult. It is also learned that the water level outside the Wusong estuary is also particularly high due to the discharge of Yangtze River floodwaters.

### Jewish Immigration; Principles Determined; Japanese Side Studying Plans

Regarding the issue of immigration for Jewish refugees forced to come to Shanghai from Central Europe, a board of directors consisting of one representative each from the French Consul General, the Japanese Consul General, the Public Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Jewish Refugee Association has been formed to discuss immigration issues. It is heard that the board of directors held a meeting on the 15th to discuss the issue of Jewish refugees' immigration and the proposed plans. The Japanese side is studying the matter, and no decision has been made at the meeting. According to Mr. Mai, representative of the Jewish Refugee Association, the principle of admitting refugees coming to Shanghai has been approved, but no decision has been made regarding the large number of refugees who will arrive in Shanghai on Sunday. He hopes that a solution can be reached at that time.

### Possible Mines Drifting off the Coast of Sandu Ao, Fujian

The Quick Joy Film Company at No. 6 Renchang Lane, Route Cardinal Foch, was negligent at around 4:00 PM on the 5th of this month, and the entire building was burned down, killing eight tenants. After the incident, Zhang Bingsheng, the owner of Quick Joy Film Company, knowing that his negligence was significant, surrendered himself to the French Concession Police. After investigation by the French Concession authorities, he was prosecuted for crimes such as negligent homicide and endangering public safety. The families of the victims, Zhang Baotang (a lawyer), filed an incidental civil suit, requesting compensation for losses and consolation money totaling over 7,300 yuan. The case was concluded by Judge Miao Qingbang of the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, who ordered the defendant Zhang Bingsheng to pay a bond of 4,000 yuan to be released on bail while awaiting sentencing. Yesterday was the date for the sentence to be issued. Judge Miao cited the First Criminal Court, announced the termination of the debate, and questioned the defendant Zhang Bingsheng in detail for a long time, but Zhang Bingsheng insisted that he was not at home when the fire occurred. After verifying the statements, the court ordered the debate to be terminated and announced the judgment in court. The main text reads, "Zhang Bingsheng is guilty of negligent homicide and is sentenced to six months of imprisonment, which can be offset by a fine of three yuan per day of imprisonment." As for the part of the violation of regulations, a fine of 200 yuan shall be imposed. Regarding the civil suit part, since the two parties have already reached a settlement, it will not be accepted.

### Startling Bloodshed on Avenue Joffre; Wang Jilu Shot; Wang Currently the Business Director of the China Times; Bullet in Neck, Life May Be Safe; Cause Unknown, Stray Bullet Injured Two Others

At 8:30 AM yesterday, Wang Jilu, the business director of the China Times in this city, was suddenly shot near his residence on Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession, suffering a bullet wound. The details obtained are recorded below.

Business Director Surprised and Uneasy

Wang Jilu, a native of Songjiang who is currently the business director of the China Times, is 53 years old and lives at No. 12, Alley 1232 (i.e., Yingcun), Route Cardinal Foch at the intersection of Route Sayzoong. Because Wang's income at the China Times is very low, his finances are very tight. He usually travels on foot, but sometimes he is picked up and dropped off by the newspaper's vehicles.

Walking on Foot, Ambushed at the Alley Entrance

Yesterday morning, after Wang finished breakfast, he put on a dark gray silk long gown and white gold-rimmed glasses. Because he was obese and the weather was hot, he did not wear a hat on his bald head. He slowly walked out of the alley, unaware that someone had been lying in wait there, preparing to stage this horrific bloodbath.

Three Shots Fired, Bullet in the Neck

When Wang left the alley and walked east, he had not walked far, just as he was walking to the border between No. 1222A Avenue Joffre (Avenue Cardinal Foch) and the Huang Yongtai Chinese Medicine Shop, a short-sleeved thug suddenly jumped out from behind him and fired three shots at Wang. Wang was caught off guard, and the first bullet hit his left rear neck. Because they were very close, the force of the bullet was extremely strong, passing directly through the left side of his nose and face.

Stray Bullet Through Door, Injuring Pedestrians

When Wang was shot, he was still conscious and knew that something was wrong. He quickly fled into the Lafaille Dry Cleaning Shop. Seeing Wang escape, the gunman chased after him and fired two more shots. One bullet pierced the shop's glass door, and the other bullet flew elsewhere, hitting He Hongliang (31 years old, living at No. 19 Fuxingfang on that road), a clerk at the Bajia Shoe Store, in the leg. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the gunman abandoned Wang, mixed into the crowd, and fled. This was because it was the time when the small vegetable market was opening.

Escaped Into Shop, Sent to Hospital

After Wang escaped into the shop, he moved to the ironing room behind the shop. Blood was flowing profusely. Many of the shop's employees were greatly alarmed and fled. One employee sounded the alarm. When the police arrived after receiving the news, the ironing room was covered in blood, and many of the clothes that had been ironed on the ironing board were also covered in blood. They immediately took Wang and the pedestrian injured by the stray bullet to Guangci Hospital. However, Wang's family, although nearby, did not know that Wang had been shot on the way.

Did Not Receive Any Warning Beforehand

Although Wang's injuries were serious, his condition was still good after treatment, and because the bullet had been removed, his life may be safe. Wang's family is very small, with only Wang's wife, three children, and one maid. According to an announcement by the French Police, in addition to the passerby He Hongliang, Shen Genxin, a 15-year-old child from Pudong, was also injured in the head by a stray bullet when the shooting occurred. It is investigated that Wang was suddenly shot and ambushed this time and did not receive any warnings beforehand. The police are currently investigating the cause.

### True Cholera Continues to Be Discovered; Two More People Confirmed at the Epidemic Hospital

According to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, cholera is continuing to spread in Shanghai. In addition to the still-being-tested patient's feces not yet reported by the Shanghai Municipal Council's laboratory, two more people have been confirmed by the Shanghai Municipal Council's laboratory. One is Wang Afu, male, 41 years old, a ship crew member at the Huidefeng Transportation Company, No. 3 Yangjingbang Road. The second is Zhang Shenshi, female, 48 years old, a maid at a cigarette paper shop, No. 44 Julai Road. Both of the above were sent to the hospital for treatment on August 25 and have not yet been discharged.

### Lingering Heat

The autumn sun is wreaking havoc on this city, the heat is extreme, and there is no sign of it abating. In recent days, the sun has been blazing, and the midday temperature has risen to over ninety degrees. It is also very sultry. Although there was a shower of rain yesterday, it did not reduce the heat. Furthermore, according to records, the weather in this city is usually coolest in August, with the highest temperature of the month being only ninety-four degrees, and the lowest dropping to seventy degrees point five, with an average high of only eighty-six degrees point seven. Also, there were sixteen days of rain throughout the month, so the climate is naturally cooler.

### Old Woman Hangs Herself

The newly built Mei Dong New Village houses on Avenue Edward VII have been completed, but the bamboo fences have not yet been removed. Yesterday morning, around five o'clock, a man discovered an old woman, nearly sixty years old, hanging herself with a rope between the bamboo fences. He immediately called for workers and others to help rescue her. Because it was still early, she was fortunately saved and woke up. The old woman's hair was already gray. She claimed her name was Yang Wang, and she lived in a nearby neighborhood. She has a husband and a son who works away from home. Because the sub-landlord raised the rent, she became angry and resorted to this desperate measure.

### Wife Stricken with Illness Returns to Hometown; Dove Occupies Magpie's Nest; Recovery Leads to Love River Turning into Sea of Vinegar; Report of Arrest for Adultery and Public Prosecution for Adultery

Zhang Guolian, a small proprietor of a tea house at No. 1 North Fujian Road, Suzhou native, has long been addicted to singing and dancing. Last autumn, he developed a love affair with Hu Ying, a dancer from Dalu Dance Hall, whose registered residence was Haimen. They began living together, flying as a couple, like a real husband and wife. In December, after Zhang married Wang Ziying, a graduate of Mingde Girls' Middle School, he remained deeply in love with the dancer. He initially tried his best to appease his wife, so he never revealed any flaws. However, Ziying contracted a contagious disease, with sores and scars all over her body, causing both pain and itching. Suspecting something, she questioned him, which angered Zhang. He then changed his attitude and turned love into hate. Ziying, unable to bear his violence, returned to her mother's home. After her illness was cured, her father asked Zhang to welcome her back. However, Zhang ignored her. Ziying, however, did not want to stay at her mother's house for long, guarding an empty room and wasting her youth. Therefore, on the ninth of this month, she returned to her husband's home at No. 5, Lane 365, Shanhai Guan Road (i.e., Yulin Lane). She intended to continue their sweet married life with Zhang. Unexpectedly, upon entering, she saw Hu Ying in the room, intimately whispering sweet words. Since Ziying had returned to her hometown, Zhang had brought back Taoye, and the dove had occupied the magpie's nest, not just for a day or two. That day, Zhang could not have foreseen his wife's sudden return and was unable to hide his lover, causing the two beauties to meet face to face, stirring up a sea of vinegar. At that time, Ziying quarreled with Zhang and, filled with resentment, returned to her mother's home. Until six o'clock in the morning on the fifteenth, anticipating that the couple's sweet dream would be in full swing, she reported it to the Xin Zha police station. The chief dispatched detectives to Zhang's house for investigation. They found Zhang and Hu Ying lying in the same bed in their undergarments. They were both arrested and taken back to the police station. Both confessed to adultery. The police then dismissed the case and filed a public prosecution for adultery against the man and woman to the First Special District Local Court. Yesterday morning, the two defendants were summoned for trial. First, Zhang Guolian reported the case. Qian Xunjiu, the police station's lawyer, explained the case. Then, Zhang Wang Ziying described the events in detail, saying that she and Zhang were cousins ​​and married. Now that Zhang has committed adultery, she requested that he be detained and that Hu Ying, who had not been summoned, be arrested and punished. She also hired a lawyer to file an additional private lawsuit, demanding compensation for damages of three thousand yuan. Judge Meng then questioned Zhang Guolian, who confessed that he had met Hu Ying in August of last year. Now, the woman and her mother have moved from No. 13 Gordon Road, Wuding Road, to Jia Yu Road in Hongkou. The court decided to notify them to surrender themselves. The court then adjourned the hearing until next Thursday.

### Yang Zaishan Assassination Case: Fan Falin Surrenders; Confesses to Grudges from Joint Transportation Company with Yang; Court Orders Temporary Detention, Rescheduling for Further Investigation

Yang Zaishan, or Yang Zaisan, a native of Changyinsha, sixty-three years old this year, was suddenly shot in the back by Xu Zimao, a native of Siyang, in front of the Juyuan Pavilion Restaurant next to Baoyu Lane at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession, around twelve o'clock on April 5th of this year. Because the bullet jammed and did not come out, Yang was fortunately not injured. The detectives arrested Xu and sent him to the Second Special Court. The French Concession authorities filed a public prosecution against him for attempted murder. Judge Liao Yanting questioned Xu, who confessed that he was acting on orders from his superiors to kill Yang. The plaintiff, Yang Zaishan, claimed that Fan Falin owed him more than two thousand yuan when they jointly established a shipping business last year. Because he demanded repayment, they became enemies, and he incited someone to commit the crime. He also implicated Xiong Guisong, who was raised by him and showed ingratitude. As a result, Xu Zimao was sentenced to five years in prison for attempted murder. All details were reported in this newspaper. Now, Fan Falin (thirty-five years old, native of Haimen, residing at No. 216 Xuhong Road in the Chinese-administered area of ​​Shanghai) surrendered himself to the French police station the day before yesterday. The chief detained him and sent him to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday morning. Judge Miao interrogated him. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer for the French Concession authorities, explained the case, saying that the defendant was involved in the attempted murder case and surrendered himself, requesting temporary detention and rescheduling for further investigation. According to Fan Falin's confession, he and Yang Zaishan had jointly established a transportation company, but later had disputes over accounts and broke up unhappily. After the court verified the confession, it ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled for further investigation.

### Abandoned Wife, New Love

Recently, Jiang found out about her husband's whereabouts and, because her husband had abandoned her for thirteen months, went to No. 51 Hengmao Lane the day before yesterday to find her husband and demand living expenses. She was beaten severely by Pu and his concubine. Jiang, unwilling to accept this, reported it to the French police station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Pu Zengsan and his concubine, Pu Danan. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer filed charges of assault and interference with the family. Judge Zhu Chuzhe interrogated them. The plaintiff, Pu Jiang, recounted the events of being abandoned by her husband and being assaulted.

The court ordered a rescheduling, asking the victim to have her injuries examined before further questioning. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Finance: Emergency in Europe, Sharp Fall in Exchange Rates between England and America, Frequent Hong Kong Calls, British Gold Easier than American

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: Because the exchange rate between England and America lacked support, the exchange rate of England against America plunged 201.2 points. Therefore, the HSBC US exchange rate in this city suddenly contracted by 25, breaking the tight price of 6.3125 yuan on the 11th of this month, and even created an unprecedented low price of 6.0625 yuan. French, Dutch, Luxembourg, Indian, and German exchange rates also contracted accordingly. Other exchange rates, such as British, did not change. The black market for British and American exchange rates opened in the morning, also diverging, showing a situation where British was flat and American was soft. British gold was still 3 shillings 6.25 pence, while the US exchange rate was only 6.75 yuan. After opening, it was still relatively calm. After 9:30, because Hong Kong and Chinese merchants frequently tended to sell, the market situation was quite loose and excessive. At noon, the hardest British gold reached 3 shillings 9.0625 pence, and the US exchange rate also softened to 7.25 yuan. As a result, the market closed with British gold at 3 shillings 8.75 pence and the US exchange rate at 7.1875 yuan. However, HSBC's appetite was quite good in the middle, and foreign firms were also settling their accounts, so it once turned softer. Ultimately, due to demand not being able to defeat supply, although it lasted for a long time, the September futures also softened accordingly. In the end, the British exchange rate weakened further due to the sharp fall in the British-American mutual exchange rate. However, the August-September swap spread narrowed slightly. It is said that a certain bank would offer half a yuan for US dollars, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of 7.8%. However, a large amount of US dollars would be offered at 5.625 yuan. Trading was still strong for half a day. Starting today, there will be two days of closure for the weekend holiday.

The banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of British gold at 3 shillings 6.25 pence and US exchange rates at 6.75 yuan, compared to the previous closing, British flat and American sharply tighter by 3125. This was due to the sharp contraction in the British-American exchange rate. After opening, Hong Kong first sent a sell order to HSBC for spot British gold at 3 shillings 6.25 pence and spot US exchange rate at 6.6875 yuan. At that time, the situation was still flat.

Other exchange rates, such as French, Dutch, Luxembourg, Indian, and German, were also adjusted accordingly, and the silver balance tax was announced at 5.25 points.

It is estimated that Hong Kong electricity and Chinese merchants sold to HSBC, Huabi, Youli, and other foreign banks spot British gold at 3 shillings 75 and 875 pence, and then successively sold to HSBC and American banks spot US exchange rates from 6.875 yuan to 7.25 yuan. Later, the hardest British gold bank had even given 3 shillings 90625 pence, and the loosest US wine had also given 7.1875 yuan. Around 9:50, because HSBC's appetite was quite good, it caused various foreign firms to close positions, and the selling wind had also subsided at that time, so the trend turned softer. It is estimated that the foreign firms closed in foreign banks spot British gold at 3 shillings 8125 pence and spot US exchange rates at 7 yuan and 6.9375 yuan. After this, the situation turned calm again. Around 11:00, because Hong Kong electricity came again with a sell order, and at the same time, Chinese merchants started selling again, the situation became loose again. It is estimated that Hong Kong electricity and Chinese merchants sold to HSBC and other foreign banks spot British gold at 3 shillings 875 pence, and also sold to Huabi Youli and other prohibited banks spot US exchange rates at 7.125 yuan and 25 yuan. Near noon, McCalley entered the interbank market for spot British gold at 3 shillings 9025 pence. Extended to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold at 3 shillings 875 pence and US exchange rates at 7.1875 yuan. This month's price is still similar to the spot price. September British gold is 3 shillings 59375 pence and US exchange rates are 6.5625 yuan.

In a situation of demand without supply, the opening price in the morning was as high as 4,250 yuan. Later, it was heard that the US exchange rate followed the same trend as the British gold, and the guest banks stood by and watched, and the money exchange industry and the gold shop industry competed to sell, and many parties cut positions more closely, and the price plunged to the 4,000 yuan mark. Fortunately, it was blocked by the limit price buyers, and there were many buyers who were optimistic about the European situation, so the price hovered around 4,050 yuan, and then continued to fall by 110 yuan. In the afternoon, the market was closed for the holiday, and it was heard that the off-market price had risen to 4,090 yuan. The trading volume in the first half of the day was 800 to 900 taels. The price of jewelry gold also initially rose, then fell, and then rebounded, with a small increase of 5 yuan, and was listed at 410 yuan. The astonishing rise in the price of Customs Gold Units and China-British pure gold, etc., during the tense situation in Germany and Czechoslovakia last year, suddenly reappeared on that day. Today is a holiday for Confucius' birthday, but it coincides with Sunday, so there will be a make-up holiday on Monday tomorrow.

Cash Prices Fluctuate Unsteadily, Plummeting 110 Yuan

Since the beginning of the morning, each tael (ten taels) initially rose sharply due to the news that pure British gold rose sharply by more than 2 shillings, which caused people's hearts to be agitated. For a time, the buying sentiment was quite strong, and sellers were reluctant to sell. The opening price was as high as 115 yuan. A certain silver shop entered the gold shop industry with ten taels, at a price of 4,250 yuan, which was the peak of the day. After the opening, it was heard that after the foreign exchange was sold by the Hong Kong electricity and other companies, the trend was quite loose, and people's hearts suddenly turned downwards. A certain gold shop and the money exchange industry competed to sell sharply, and the gold shop industry also frequently sold. In addition, the guest bank's appetite was weak. By 10:00, the price had plummeted by 250 yuan. A certain money exchange industry sold to a gold shop 20 taels at a price of 4,000 yuan, which was the low point of the day. Later, it was heard that the foreign exchange had slightly softened, which caused the selling wind to stop. A certain money exchange industry absorbed more than 200 taels on behalf of a wealthy merchant, and the price soon rebounded by 70 yuan. The gold shops traded with each other for 30 taels, and the price was 4,070 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the foreign exchange was trending looser again. Although a certain gold shop vigorously entered more than 100 taels, the silver shop industry and retail investors were selling quite actively, which once again lowered the price to 4,030 yuan. Later, the securities industry and the money exchange industry absorbed dozens of taels, and the price was pulled up to 4,060 yuan. Near noon, due to a certain money exchange industry selling on behalf of retail investors, and the foreign exchange was still soft, the price fell by 35 yuan. The gold shop sold to the money exchange industry 10 taels, at a price of 4,025 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, compared to the previous day, the price plummeted by 110 yuan again. There was a fluctuation of 250 yuan in half a day. The selling price of the cash shops' own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than that of cash gold, and the price of the current building gold was 65 yuan lower than that of the listed gold, but there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Initially Rose and Then Fell, Changed to 410 Yuan

The gold jewelry of silver shops was initially offered at 415 yuan per tael by Datonghang. At 9:35, the price was raised by 10 yuan. More than 5 minutes later, the price fell back by 5 yuan. At 9:45, the price increased by a small amount of 5 yuan again. At 9:50, the price was lowered by a small amount of 5 yuan. At 10:00, the price was lowered again by 5 yuan. At 3:05 in the afternoon, the price increased by 5 yuan. As a result, the price was lowered by a small amount of 5 yuan. It is estimated that the price of Datonghang was changed to 410 yuan, and the price of new banks was 408 yuan. The price for purchase must be reduced by about 20 yuan.

Pure British Gold Soars by 2 Shillings and 1 Penny

London, 25th telegram: Due to the European crisis, the astonishing buying spree of pure British gold during the tense situation in Germany and Czechoslovakia last year reappeared today. The pound sterling was weak, causing the price to soar by more than 2 shillings and 1 penny per ounce, reaching a new high of £7 10s 6d. The Shanghai Central Bank's listed price of Customs Gold Units also rose sharply, soaring by 3.5 points, reaching 2 yuan 4 jiao 2 fen 9 li. The Shanghai standard gold price soared by 16 yuan 9 jiao, reaching 1,223 yuan 8 jiao. The purchase price of Chinese pure gold rose to 1,228 yuan 5 jiao.

### British and Australian Gold Certificates Plummet, Only US Certificates Rise

Yesterday, due to the weakening of the foreign exchange market, the cash gold market initially strengthened and then weakened, resulting in a sharp decline. The British and American gold pounds were affected and declined, but the actual supply was scarce, and the demand was very strong. In the midst of the turmoil, hard currency ultimately prevailed. British gold certificates plummeted sharply, and those who had collected them in the past competed to sell, falling by as much as 56 yuan, which was very weak. US gold certificates were welcomed by all countries, and the demand was the strongest. The market price rose alone. Hong Kong and French francs, etc., have weakened with the times. Australian gold certificates have fallen very badly, falling to 39 yuan. Annam, Philippine, etc., have not been affected, and the market situation is stable. The supply and demand of Japanese gold certificates is still strong, and the market situation is trending firm, with the evening price at 1 yuan 1 jiao 7 fen. Korean certificates are stable, still at 1 yuan 0 jiao 2 fen 5 li. Yesterday's market price: British and American gold pounds both fell by 1 yuan, British gold certificates fell by 6 yuan 8 jiao, US gold certificates rose by 2 jiao 5 fen, Hong Kong certificates fell by 2 jiao 9 fen, French franc certificates fell by 1 fen 5 li, Singapore certificates fell by 4 jiao, rupee certificates fell by 6 jiao, German gold certificates fell by 1 jiao, Australian gold certificates fell by 10 yuan, and other currencies were unchanged.

### Discount Rate Lowered by 5 Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange bills initially remained flat and then fell. The rate per thousand yuan was around 185 yuan in the morning, and in the afternoon, due to the holiday for foreign exchange cash, etc., the demand for cash was less, so it gradually decreased to 180 yuan, which was 5 yuan lower than the previous day. The interest rate for interbank loans in the money industry association was still listed at 1 jiao 8 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities: Fewer New Short Positions in Public Bonds

The securities black market situation yesterday, due to the atmosphere of peace, gradually saw circulation, and people's hearts had a slight sign of awakening. Public bonds therefore gradually recovered and had a little vitality. The price of Class C bonds had already been traded above 43 yuan 2 jiao 3 fen near dusk the day before yesterday, but due to the abundance of floating positions, they were sold off at high prices. Therefore, the market initially traded at 3 yuan 1 jiao in the morning, and then immediately plunged, almost reaching 1 yuan. However, new short positions were extremely rare. People's hearts, at least due to the sudden and unexpected change in German-Soviet relations, paid close attention to the changes in public bonds. Since the rumors of suspension of principal and interest payments on June 19 and 22 and the double blow of bank restrictions on deposits, the bond market has been languishing at a low price of more than 10 yuan for two months. At this time, after the sudden and successive major changes in various countries in the world, the Sino-Japanese issue may take a sharp turn for the worse as a result, and the general public in the market has shifted their attention accordingly. Yesterday's trading saw more active buying, with Runli Hongkang absorbing at high prices, and Yongkang's appetite was also not weak. Tiansheng and Yongfeng, as well as general retail investors, emerged as bulls. The market price was high and then low, but ultimately it still rose by 3 to 5 jiao. The total transaction volume was about 700,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below:

Stock trading: 50 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded at a price of 6 yuan 1 jiao.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that the market was sluggish and the prices were unchanged. London rubber reserves are expected to decrease by 4,100 tons this week. The prices of London British Far East companies' stocks on the 25th (Friday) of this month showed mixed gains and losses. McCalley Bank's stock fell slightly by 2 shillings 6 pence, with the price at £6 exactly. HSBC Bank's UK-registered stock rose by £4.5, and the Hong Kong-registered stock rose by £2.5, with the prices both at £70. The above three types all had prices but no market. Culake Linbang Rubber's stock rose by 9 pence, with the price at 15 shillings 9 pence. All the other stocks were unchanged.

London Chinese foreign debt prices on the 25th (Friday) of this month remained stable and unchanged.

### Seafood: Jinshan Shrimp Tails are Almost Gone

The supply of Jinshan shrimp tails has been interrupted, causing the bottom stock here to be almost exhausted, and the various companies are not reporting, so the market price has soared. The most recent price was 275 yuan, and now the market is singing higher again at 300 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: New Buyers are Extremely Scarce, Yarn Prices Decline Again, Shuangma and Tiannv Each Fall by 15 Yuan

The yarn market, which had soared for seven days, returned to a calm path yesterday. Some of the bulls closed their positions, and there was a slight pullback. However, the downward trend was more gradual. Some believed that there was still no hope for a loosening of raw material prices, so the generally strong held on to the yarn they had stockpiled, and there was no intention of giving up. The market situation was not very volatile. However, the strict guard in Hong Kong and the gathering of Japanese warships had an impact on the purchases of the Hong Kong companies.

The opening momentum of the current yarn was peaceful. Because the previous day's rise was too strong and there were no other changes, new buyers in the market suddenly decreased, and the opening price fell by a large amount of 10 to 20 yuan. The single price of 20-count Bianma Wharf was 625 yuan, and the spot price was 700 yuan. A little later, it fell by another 5 yuan. Not long after, it was said that the exchange rate for drafts denominated in US dollars had been reduced, and the atmosphere suddenly became tight, rebounding by 10 yuan. The single price of Shuangma Wharf was 630 yuan, and the spot price was 710 yuan. Then, although the US dollar was reduced, the pound sterling was extended, and the closing price turned weak again. According to the statistics of half-day transactions, 1,010 bales were traded, and the market prices were 20-count Shuangma falling by 15 yuan, Shuangqiu falling by 19 yuan, and Tiannv falling by 15 yuan. Tomorrow, 30 pieces of cotton yarn will be exported to Qingdao. The amount of purchases by each company is listed on the left:

Hong Kong: 280 Same industry: 495

Inland: 235 Total: 1,010

Also, the 27th of this month is the anniversary of Confucius' birthday, which coincides with Sunday. Therefore, the holiday will be made up on Monday, the 28th. The current yarn market will be closed for one day. It is also said that the silver and money industry will also be closed for one day.

### Current Raw Cotton Bales Unheard of Trading

Spot transactions of raw cotton, both domestic and foreign, have completely ceased, with no bales sold. This is due to the fact that factories have ample cotton reserves and do not need to purchase raw materials for the time being. Although yarn prices were flat yesterday and foreign exchange rates eased, the buying interest remained weak. However, market prices remained firm, making it exceptionally difficult for manufacturers to purchase. Inter-dealer transactions have also come to a standstill. Supplies from northern Jiangsu have improved, with 584 bales arriving in Tongzhou and 45 bales from Beisha.

Furthermore, news from Shanghai indicates that due to the soaring overseas cotton market, fewer ships are transporting cotton to China, resulting in thin inventories in Shanghai. Consequently, traders are unwilling to sell, leading to sluggish trading activity. However, they are unwilling to lower prices. As for the factories, they are hesitant to buy due to the unstable situation.

Regarding overseas cotton prices, the New York cotton market opened weak, with speculators selling off. Overseas cotton merchants followed suit, causing prices to gradually decline. As a result, closing prices were down eight to ten points from the previous day. In Liverpool, the cotton market surged by 28 points yesterday due to the European crisis. India also saw a sharp contraction due to the exchange rate with the United Kingdom and the United States, with the cotton market, including forecasts, soaring by over six rupees. The Egyptian cotton market also rose by over 20 points.

### Grains: Lower Prices for Ke Xian Rice, New Jiangbei Xian Rice Arriving in Steady Streams, Jing Rice Briefly Increased Before Returning to Flat

Du Jing Rice: A total of 36 boats of Songjiang Nangang goods arrived from Hexia. However, due to various reasons, they could only reach Yangjiabo and Dongchang Road in Pudong. Over 2,000 packages of newly harvested Jing Rice arrived by wheelbarrow. The early market opening was still weak, with new and old rice falling by one to two yuan. Although the price drop stimulated activity on the street, prices were still difficult to raise. As for thick rice, it was mostly blocked, with little supply on the market, resulting in a flat situation. In the end, Gao Xi Jing rice sold for 38.5 to 38 yuan, Su Tong San Kun Jing rice for 17 yuan, Jiangxia early and late rice for 35.5 to 35 yuan, original packages for 37 to 36.78 yuan, aged Wu rice for 33.5 to 32 yuan, and new rice for 32.5 yuan, settling at 31 yuan. A total of over 4,600 packages were traded. Change in Yuan was not done.

Ke Xian Rice: Arrivals were still strong yesterday, with another 3,000 to 4,000 packages arriving from Jiangjing, Beijing, and Wu areas. Furthermore, new Jiangbei Xian Rice is about to arrive in steady streams, so confidence has returned to flat. Sellers are eager to sell off their goods at lower prices. As a result, new Xian Rice opened at only 33 to 31 yuan, a slight decrease of one to two yuan compared to the previous market price of 34 to 35 yuan. Beijing Wu Xian Rice also experienced a small decline.

Foreign Rice: New transactions are sluggish, and spot goods have not been sold. However, it is rumored that the financial sector, during the extension of exchange rates, ordered 1,000 tons of new Saigon rice at a combined price of only 32 to 33 yuan, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of the month.

### Reduced Demand for Returned Flour, Limited Excitement in Wheat

Flour prices continued to be flat and soft. Although factory prices have not changed, the prices of returned goods have eased. This is because factories can supply large customers on this street as much as possible and deliver goods at any time. Therefore, this street no longer needs returned goods. Furthermore, the Beiyang gang is quiet due to the Tianjin floods, while the Nanyang gang is even less likely to transport goods due to the current situation. As a result, the prices of returned goods and brands like Ping Chuan have fallen to 0.45 yuan and 0.35 yuan, respectively. Foreign flour has also dropped by about 0.1 yuan. Yesterday, some customers traded at a price of only 6.45 yuan.

The supply of wheat is gradually increasing, with large amounts coming from Beijing, Yu, Su, and Xi. This is because since wheat prices rose to 10 yuan, there has been an increasing number of people engaged in the wheat business. Furthermore, due to the unpredictable changes in the international situation, stockpilers are not buying as aggressively as they did in the previous two days, resulting in less excitement in the market. In general, only Fu and Fu factories purchased a total of 12,000 packages of wheat from Suzhou, Guandian, Wuxi, Danyang, Changzhou, Benniu, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, etc. High-quality goods can still maintain a reasonable price, but medium-quality goods have seen a slight price drop of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. There has been no trading among stockpilers.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Prices Decline

After a sharp drop in soybean oil prices, they had briefly recovered. However, with the tense global situation in the past two days, speculation in the market has somewhat subsided, and buying interest is only greedy. Yesterday, the market sentiment eased, and prices fell by more than one yuan compared to the highest price of the previous day. The underlying trend seems to be returning to normal. A total of 20 barrels of Tianjin soybean oil were traded at a price of 55.5 yuan, and 30 barrels of Dalian oil were also traded at a price of 55.5 yuan. In addition, 180 barrels of Kobe oil arriving from Dalian were priced from 58 yuan, frequently falling to 57.1 yuan, all destined for this street. 100 barrels of Tianjin peanut oil were settled at a price of 72 yuan, which was distributed by the street gang.

### Silk and Tea: Only the American Zhuang Firm Trading in Silk

The local silk market was very lifeless yesterday. It is impossible to predict the future of the European situation. Foreign firms have also received telegrams from their head offices that shipments to London and Lyon have been temporarily suspended due to the current situation. As a result, most foreign firms have stopped buying European-bound raw silk. The American Zhuang firm only traded 30 dan yesterday, with seventh or eighth grade white factory silk at 3,900 yuan and ungraded, B-grade silk at 3,600 yuan. Although manufacturers are willing to sell, they are hesitant and are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. As a result, telex transactions have decreased significantly.

New York spot prices remained unchanged yesterday. Short-term prices were up 0.05 yuan, while long-term prices were down 5 yuan. Yokohama spot prices were down 10 yuan, and long-term prices were down 5 yuan. Overseas transactions also lacked intensity.

### Sugar Market: Public Prices Rise Sharply

According to a London telegram, the sugar market did not fluctuate much yesterday. December prices were 6 shillings and 3.5 pence, while March and June of next year were both 6 shillings and 4 pence. The association's publicly announced prices continued to rise, with spot prices up 1.4 yuan. Local godown prices were 42.3 yuan, while foreign godown prices were 41.5 yuan, later rising to 42 yuan. Transshipment goods initially sold for 33.5 yuan, then rose to 34 yuan. Taikoo Che Bai also rose by 1.5 to 1.8 yuan, with West Godown prices at 45.4 to 46 yuan and East Godown prices at 45.2 to 45.8 yuan. West Godown CW marks were 45.7 yuan, CX marks were 45.4 yuan, DV marks were 45 yuan, HX marks were 44.8 yuan, and H marks also rose by 1 yuan to 30 yuan. Dutch red spot prices were 39 yuan, up 2 yuan, and transshipment prices were 32.5 yuan, up 1.9 yuan. Local Mian Bai rose by 1 yuan, Zhen Ji No. 1 was 42 yuan, and local No. 1 Bing rose by 2 yuan to 47.5 yuan. Jing Ming Bing was 49 yuan. National Sugar Dong Xiang red rose by about 3 yuan, opening at 35.5 yuan for 125 packages. Furthermore, Special High was 184 yuan, 36 yuan, and Special High Da Gong powder was over 100 packages, opening at 53.4 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Stockpilers Release Inventory, White Goods Plunge Again

National Cloth

Yesterday, the foreign exchange rate fluctuated abruptly, causing anxiety. Stockpilers released their inventory, and the market turned downward again. Ewo 16-pound plain coarse cloth was still sold at only 20 yuan, with even lower prices for larger quantities. White coarse cloth, fine cloth, and patterned cloth fell by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan, returning to the prices of the 24th. Prices for bleached and dyed cloth also softened. On this street, over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, bleached cloth, and flannel were traded. Ningbo merchants purchased 60 to 70 pieces of colored cloth, woolen cloth, patterned flannel, and coarse cloth. Gan merchants purchased over 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth. Merchants from Yunnan and Guangdong also continued to make purchases. Overseas Nanyang merchants from Singapore and other places purchased several thousand pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, printed cloth, and colored cloth.

Eastern Piece Goods

Yesterday, due to sluggish customer activity, white goods selling became even more intense. Although dyeing factories and wholesalers on this street made small purchases, total transactions for fine cloth and fine twill did not exceed 500 pieces. Fine cloth fell back by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per piece, and fine twill also dropped by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Spot goods of Dragon Head fine cloth sold for 17.85 yuan, and Yang He fine cloth was only 16.75 yuan. Low-priced Yang He fine twill had already sold for over 16.56 yuan. Traders were willing to sell off their goods at lower prices, and the situation was weakening. On the 28th, 50 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai.

### Northern and Southern Hebei: Longkou Noodles Open at New High Prices

The arrival of Longkou noodles has been limited recently, and the market is exceptionally firm. Yesterday, it was reported that customer goods opened at over 30 pieces, reaching as high as 115 yuan. The market price was 116 yuan, and despite the unusually high price due to the scarcity of goods, demand remained active.

### Coal: New Arrival of Kailuan Coal: Over 3,000 Tons

Kailuan bituminous coal was previously scarce, and demand on this street was strong, leading to the clearing of all inventory. Recently, new goods have been arriving in succession. Yesterday, the Ma Le wheel brought another 3,500 tons of Kailuan Tong coal, which was sold by Yitai Xing. The price for Tong coal was 58 yuan per ton at the wharf, and the price for screened lumps was 63 yuan. It is reported that over 1,000 tons have already been sold.

### Respect Your Teachers

— Yin

Today is the first Teachers' Day as announced by the Ministry of Education. Originally, today was Confucius's birthday anniversary. The Ministry of Education's decision to change Teachers' Day to today is of great significance. I remember that when children went to school in the past, they had to pray to the statue of Confucius or bow to the spiritual tablet of "Heaven, Earth, Monarch, Parents, and Teachers." This was an expression of respect for teachers. Later, these rituals gradually ceased with the changes in the school system. Students have also gradually become indifferent to teachers. The relationship between teachers and students does not seem to be taken seriously. However, if children put themselves in the shoes of their teachers, they will realize that teachers are indeed the most respectable people in society.

Teachers sacrifice everything in their lives for their students. They receive only a small remuneration and work diligently for their students all day long. They must endure any annoyance and shoulder any hardship. Teachers must teach and move many stubborn children who refuse to learn, so that they can live in the future and take on the work in society. They are painstakingly carrying out their tasks for the basic education of the nation, for the spirit of the nation, and for the education of the future masters of the country, and their remuneration is so meager. Children, can you not respect your teachers?

Yes, sometimes your teachers, because of mental and material stimulation, their attitude towards you may inevitably make you unhappy, but children, you should also forgive the teachers for this situation. No matter which teacher, his times of distress are always more than his times of happiness. You always understand that there are indeed many affectionate students who appreciate the teachers' spirit of working hard for the students. However, there are also children who do not know what is good for them, who take the teachers' kindness for granted, and who look down on the teachers' work. How can this not make the teachers feel resentful! Dear children, in Guangxi, they have already implemented letters of respect for teachers. On today's Teachers' Day, I would also like to raise the slogan "Respect Teachers" to encourage children. Use the spirit and attitude of respecting Confucius in the past to respect teachers!

Amicis, in his famous book Education of Love, told children that the most respectable name besides their father's name is the name of their teacher. Please reflect again, children, have you ever had a psychology and attitude of contempt for your teacher?

### The Great Confucius

— Wang Xiuhe

Confucius was a great scholar of ancient China, and also a great scholar of the East. He is revered by the world, along with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle of the West. He was born on the Gengzi day of the tenth month of the 21st year of King Ling of Zhou (August 27, 2462 BC) and died on the Yichou day of the fourth month of the 41st year of King Jing of Zhou (2390 BC). He was 73 years old.

As a child, Confucius loved to display sacrificial vessels and practice sacrificial rituals. As a teenager, he went to the Zhou royal family to study ancient etiquette from Lao Tzu, and also went to the state of Qi to study ancient music from the Grand Master. Throughout his life, he only strived to learn. He said, "If I hear the Tao in the morning, I can die in the evening." "When three people are walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher." From this, we can see his seriousness in learning.

He was not only a scholar, but also a practical politician and educator. In the tenth year of Duke Ding, he served as the Minister of Justice of the state of Lu. In this year, Duke Ding of Lu and Duke Jing of Qi met at Jiagu (now Laiwu County, Shandong). When Duke Ding set out, Confucius said to Duke Ding, "I have heard that those who have civil affairs must have military preparations; those who have military affairs must have civil preparations. In ancient times, when the dukes went out of the territory, they must have officials to follow them. Please prepare the left and right Sima." Duke Ding thought it was right, so he ordered Confucius to take troops with him. At the meeting, the Qi envoy Lai people came out to play music, and the palace women came out to sing and dance. Confucius sternly stopped them, winning a lot of face for the state of Lu. (When the two countries meet, their positions are equal. If the Qi envoy Lai people play music and dance, then Qi becomes the master and Lu becomes the follower. Wouldn't this be a great loss of face.)

Four years later, Confucius acted as prime minister. After three months, the country was well governed, and the people of Qi were greatly afraid. Therefore, they used a trick to prevent Confucius from exercising his power. At this point, Confucius resigned and retired. Later, he traveled around the states of Qi, Song, Wei, Chen, Cai, and Chu, but he did not meet a confidant. In desperation, he returned to the state of Lu, deleted poems and books, set etiquette and music, praised the Book of Changes, and revised the Spring and Autumn Annals to pass on the way of the former kings. He had 3,000 disciples, of whom 72 were proficient in the six arts.

His spirit of being a person, whether reading or doing things, to the point of joy, he would even forget to eat and sleep, and his sorrows would also be thrown away. He would not even ask himself what stage he had reached. He also had a spirit of not fearing difficulties, being earnest in everything, and not making any pretense. When others thought it was hopeless, he still tried his best to do it. Therefore, people at that time criticized him as a hard-working scholar who "knew that it was impossible to do it, but still did it." The main point of his theory is that people must follow the words "loyalty and forgiveness" in their interactions with each other.

Children, Confucius's birthday is coming again. When we think of his spirit of learning and doing things, we should strive to encourage ourselves and move forward bravely to promote Confucius's theory and save our critically endangered motherland. Work hard! My dear children.

### On the Highway

— Bai Zheng

—The Thirty-First Record of Ming'er's Misfortune—

The carriage was already packed with people for half an hour, but it was not yet time to leave. The refugees in the car helplessly endured and waited, waited. When the green flag was raised, the car, which had been waiting impatiently, drove out of the station with a whoosh and rushed onto the yellow sand and gravel highway, speeding forward like crazy.

Green mountains, green trees, woodcutters gathering firewood, and pedestrians rushing on the road, everything on the road moved backwards. Many different bamboo fences, thatched huts, small shops, and trees flashed past Ming'er's eyes in the carriage. Only the distant mountains, distant trees, and distant scenery were constantly rotating, as if all these things were placed on a spinning top, making Ming'er a little dizzy. The car continued to move forward, with the surrounding high mountains and low hills forming a circular encirclement around them.

Looking from the right side of the carriage, all that could be seen were the rocky cliffs, only four or five feet away from the car. This highway was entirely built by opening up the mountains. Looking from the left side of the carriage, there was a mountain depression thousands of feet deep, right at the edge of the wheels. If the stones on the road were to loosen and fall, the result would be unimaginable, causing Ming'er to shift his gaze elsewhere, not daring to look at it again.

The car kept flying along the highway, making several turns. Ming'er looked back from the back of the car and saw a narrow highway winding between the vast mountains, winding around a mountain peak and then around a small hill, like a red-chained snake coiling in the mountains. This great project is truly the lifeline necessary for the construction of a new China.

The people in the carriage suddenly stood unsteadily, and everyone unconsciously leaned to the left. Even those who were sitting had a tendency to fall over. Then they heard a burst of car noises, and everyone was worried that something was wrong with the car. Who knew that the speed of the car was too fast, and it had to make a big turn. The driver slammed on the brakes, making Ming'er's heart beat very hard. After making the turn, the mountains gradually receded, and they entered the plains, with continuous fields, crisscrossing paths, adjacent thatched houses, and increasingly frequent traces of people. Breathing suddenly became smoother, but not long after, they were surrounded by layers of mountains again.

"Airplane! Airplane!" Someone in the carriage shouted, instantly silencing the conversation in the carriage.

"Where? I didn't hear any sound! Is it silvery white?" Someone asked. The people in the carriage could not stop their feet from leaning forward again, and the sound of the car also became quiet. After a while, the sound of "rumbling..." airplanes stimulated everyone's eardrums.

Widening their eyes, they stretched their heads out of the carriage window and saw six airplanes soaring in the clouds, so small that they looked like six small dragonflies flying in the vast sky. Of course, they couldn't see anything about whether they were silvery white or not, and the sound of the airplanes was somewhat blurred, probably due to the echo in the mountains. These six dragonflies flew from the peak in the west to the mountainside in the east.

"What's so surprising about this? It stopped the car and delayed the trip. Driver, hurry up," said a bold and impatient friend.

"Don't underestimate it," if today is a silvery-white airplane, don't even think about letting us pass, it will definitely come to find us, at least put the machine gun down, their bullets are too annoying." The driver said humorously, as the car drove forward again. As the sun set, Ming'er's car finally reached its destination.

Confucius is a sage of China. His hometown is Qufu City in southern Shandong. Now there is a Confucius Temple in the city, so it is not an exaggeration to call it "China's Holy Land"?

In Qufu, there are no famous mountains or rivers, but it is precisely because of the scenic spots of the Holy Land that tourists who pass through Shandong often want to visit it.

Several years ago, a few friends and I passed through Xuzhou and took the opportunity to visit Qufu. We took a train from Xuzhou to a small station called "Yaocun" and got off. We hired two small carts and asked the coachmen to push forward from behind. After walking 18 miles for three hours, we saw a row of not very tall city walls, which was Qufu City. After entering the city gate, we got out of the car and walked towards the Confucius Temple. After passing through a small street, we saw a row of very high red walls, with many magnificent temples built inside, occupying almost half of Qufu City; this is the Confucius Temple.

We walked north along the red wall and reached the "Yucui Gate" of the Confucius Temple. After notifying at the door, someone led us in. Inside, there is a large courtyard with many ancient cypresses standing tall. In the center, there is a pavilion-like house, which is said to be the place where Confucius lectured when he was alive, called "Apricot Altar". Next to the Apricot Altar is a small house with a bare tree, which is said to be a cypress tree planted by Confucius himself. Now it has withered and only has a bare tree trunk left.

Walking further north, we saw a magnificent hall with ten white stone dragon-carved pillars in front. In the center of the hall, there is a statue of Confucius, with his hands clasped and sitting facing south. On the west side, there are also ten statues, all of whom are Confucius's disciples "that is, students." It is also said to be called the Dacheng Hall. Behind the hall, there is a sleeping hall, which houses the statue of Confucius's wife.

### In the Animal Realm (15)

— Xin Qing

Peng Qi would remember reading a book that said that when a person is dying, if he sees a skylark flying into the sky, then his soul will also fly into the sky. Therefore, he felt very uncomfortable and disappointed, knowing that his life would not be saved, and he would rot with those dead dogs and cats in the water. In an instant, Peng Qi thought of all his past sins and had to regret it. However, he usually only knew how to play with animals, and the more cruel he was, the more proud he was. Where did he think about sin or not? He also remembered that one day at school, the principal had given individual instructions to himself and several other students, saying that people should be based on kindness, and that all animals have habits, have feelings, and know pain, so they must not be abused. At that time, he just sat still, didn't say a word, his face was full of contempt and disdain, and watched the teacher walk off the podium. How could he listen to his old man's words and put them in his heart? But now, there are no more opportunities to repent, and it is too late to listen to the teacher's instructions again. Looking to the future, it is just pitch black, where is there still a glimmer of light? So he silently prayed in his shattered heart, praying to heaven to forgive his past and give him "a way to start anew". At this moment, he floated to the surface of the water for the third and last time.

The skylark flew far away and could hardly be seen anymore. But next to Peng Qi's pale face, came a soft, black nose, and a pair of large brown eyes, staring into Peng Qi's eyes. There was no sign of revenge, and there was no friendly expression. It looked like it was holding a serious, earnest, and proud attitude, and it seemed to be doing things seriously. Its soft and emotional mouth, which had been stabbed by Peng Qi before, was now used to hold Peng Qi, holding him very firmly, but without hurting his body. It looked like it didn't use any force, just like holding a water bird, and immediately flapped the front of its changing foot and swam bravely towards the shore. But Peng Qi was, after all, a person, much heavier than a dead cat, so Knox was really exhausted to swim with him. It was easy to swim to the shore, and even dragged him ashore, before dropping Peng Qi on the ground. It also lay down on the side, putting a foot on Peng Qi's body, clearly saying, "I will handle this matter, and no one else needs to interfere."

### Golden Theater Successfully Hires Two Martial Performers: Lan Yuechun and Wu Yanheng

— Zhi Bai

The Golden Theater's troupe is full of talent and known for its well-roundedness. However, the martial roles have been lacking since Wang Xiaofang left, leaving many feeling something was missing. Recognizing this, the Golden Theater has recently announced the successful hiring of martial performer Lan Yuechun. He will debut at the beginning of next month with Song Dezhu, Yang Baosen, and others. With Yuechun on board, the Golden Theater will be well-equipped to handle martial roles. I cannot help but congratulate the Golden Theater on finding such a talented performer.

Lan Yuechun, also known as Xiao Xier, is a disciple of the martial artist Li Yongli (Li Wanchun's father). He studied under Li Yongli from a young age and trained with Li Wanchun at the Great World entertainment center for a long time. Later, he went to the old capital (Beijing) and joined Yu Zhenting's Binqing Society training class with Li Wanchun. In the class, he and Li Wanchun were both considered outstanding martial performers. They collaborated in plays such as "Two Generals' Heroic Loyalty," with Yuechun playing the supporting role to Li Wanchun's lead, creating a sensation. Although Yuechun was subordinate to Wanchun during their training, his skills were actually no less impressive than Wanchun's. In 1928, when Li Wanchun first decided to go south with Mei Lanfang, they came together. Unexpectedly, they had disagreements and their relationship soured over the years. Their friendship ended due to this. After leaving Wanchun, Yuechun did not return north and wandered around for ten years, feeling frustrated and unsuccessful. Now, accepting the offer from the Golden Theater is a great opportunity for Yuechun, as he has not had a chance to showcase his skills for ten years.

Yuechun's disadvantage is his voice and appearance; his singing and recitations are not great. However, his martial arts skills are solid. His waist and leg work are better than Wanchun's. Because of his appearance, he is more suited to playing characters with painted faces in plays such as "Yanyang Tower," "The Scholar's Seal," and "Reed Catkin Beach," all of which are his specialties. Although Yuechun has lived in Jiangnan for over ten years, fortunately, he has not been influenced by the local theatrical style. His fighting is clean, his movements are agile, and he is neither too slow nor too fast, avoiding the pitfalls of a heavily stylized performance. This is truly commendable. His performance at the Golden Theater will surely allow him to showcase his great skills.

Furthermore, with Song Dezhu's decision to come to Shanghai, the Golden Theater, seeing the great popularity of Gao Shenglin, intended to find a suitable figure from the Northern martial arts scene to come with Song. Initially, they planned to hire Sun Yukun (also known as Xiao Zhenting). However, since Yang Xiaolou's death, Sun has proclaimed himself as a successor of the Yang School and has become quite arrogant, demanding a price of eight thousand. The Golden Theater considered this too high and abandoned the idea of hiring Sun, opting instead for Wu Yanheng to come along.

Wu Yanheng is the son of the famous actress Wu Caixia and the nephew of Xun Huisheng. He studied martial arts with Xu Deyi and is quite skilled. Not only does he have a solid foundation in martial arts, but his singing, recitations, acting, and appearance are all commendable. In today's sparse martial arts talent pool, Wu is a rare find. Yanheng once came to Shanghai with Xun Huisheng and has been away from Shanghai for a long time. Wu's skills are no less impressive than Gao Shenglin's. If Gao can become popular in Shanghai, Wu will undoubtedly be well-received.

### Exploration of Yan Jupeng's Singing

— Su Shaoqing

2.  Unpleasant Amplification of Parts Meant to Draw Applause: Amplifying the singing to solicit applause is originally a "biting" technique, but it requires a good voice, producing sounds that are loud and pleasant, and singing with proper and flavorful tunes, so that applause is sought and obtained. Today, Jupeng is not like this. He is very eager for applause, so he often amplifies. The result of amplification is a dry and broken sound, monotonous and slow tunes. Therefore, the applause he seeks is mixed with laughter (I observe carefully that the applause contains a friendly, supportive nature). The applause and laughter occur simultaneously, which is not as good as the silence of the audience. Old actors from fifty years ago were often displeased when hearing applause, believing it would disrupt their good tunes. Actors from thirty years ago would not intentionally amplify their voice or use tricks to solicit applause. Ordinary actors deliberately soliciting applause is something from the last twenty years, and it's only getting worse, which is also the trend, because the fees are high, and the sense of gain and loss is important. In the past, Yang Sili would use decorative singing to solicit applause, and he would not stop until there was applause. The audience would often shout "Tong" to end it, opening up a strange situation of soliciting applause. I heard that Xiao Dazi would often invite people to watch the play in order to solicit applause, which is also a strange method. Lately, older Beijing opera actors have been "sprinkling blood" (such as shaking their heads) in their performances to solicit applause, but there are still not many who amplify their voices at any time or use slow tunes to intentionally solicit applause. The arrival of applause is valued in its naturalness, when fame truly reflects ability. Why insist on forcing it? As the saying goes, "A forced melon is not sweet." When the melon is ripe, the stem falls off. Why force it? Forcing and insisting are both unnatural. If it's unnatural, there is an element of danger. Why? Because friends are embarrassed not to applaud, and strangers will definitely hate it. Friends in the audience only account for one-tenth. Therefore, it is dangerous. If Jupeng sings in a normal way with the voice he has, his subtleties are still unmatched by others, because his skill is profound. If he forcefully amplifies his voice, it is like turning gold into iron, or ruining jade with flaws. He wants to get applause, but he can't get true applause. Jupeng is wise, doesn't he see this? If he doesn't drastically change this point and return to normality, I fear that if he comes again, there will be unimaginable things. I am not exaggerating, because I have silently observed the atmosphere of the audience, as well as collected the opinions of the music lovers, and come to this conclusion. What I feel is dangerous, and I dare not keep silent. Or someone might say, Jupeng's performances lasted two weeks, and there were no empty seats. The owner of the Golden Theater had a surplus of nearly twenty thousand gold pieces. Doesn't Jupeng have enough appeal? I laugh and say, counting 1,500 people per day, the total number of people in two weeks is only 30,000. Including those who support him and are regular customers, that's about one-tenth. And the new actress Hou Yulan is also popular, which accounts for two or three-tenths. It's weaker than one percent of the total population of Shanghai now. If he still can't sell out, that's really a big problem. Jupeng hasn't been here for eight years, and his early recordings are praised by those who have heard them. The remote causes are various, and there's no need to list them one by one. If you don't examine the reasons for the unchanged popularity of the seats, and say it's the result of uneven "dimensions" and amplified applause, then I can only look up to the sky and hand it over to heaven to know, and rub my eyes to see what happens afterwards. What else can I say! Jupeng's acting has recently been greatly streamlined. There are extremely precise and admirable places, which cannot be achieved without twenty years of effort. There are occasional minor flaws, but they do not hide the great purity. This is a great improvement and worthy of being written about. In the future, it would be better to remove too much. (End)

### Recent Records of Silver Stars (Part 1)

— Yin Si

Gu Lanjun Re-Stages "Wang Xifeng's Havoc in Ningguo Mansion": Gu Lanjun recently planned to film the historical drama "Wang Xifeng's Havoc in Ningguo Mansion," working hard in the summer heat. A few days ago, she suddenly suffered from a severe illness and collapsed. Initially, she had alternating chills and fever, which were very intense. According to her sister, Meijun, when the illness was at its worst, she was delirious with a high fever, reaching 102 degrees. The family was extremely anxious and quickly called in both Chinese and Western doctors for intensive treatment. After examination, the Chinese doctor said it was a heat-induced illness, while the Western doctor said it was the flu. Recently, her condition has improved, but the filming work for Xinhua has been delayed for many days. Until the day before yesterday, "Wang Xifeng" was finally able to return to the studio and begin "Making Havoc in Ningguo Mansion."

Tan Ying Suffers as a Leper Woman: Tan Ying's new film, "Leper Woman," which has been filming for two months, is about to be completed. Yesterday, I spoke with her, and she said that the filming of this film was unusually difficult and the work was very hard. The reason is that the face of the leper woman needs to be thickly coated with many ointment-like products, which takes no less than three hours to apply. Moreover, the mouth is sealed into a semi-locked state, which makes eating very difficult. Since filming work usually lasts for nearly ten hours, even if she feels hungry, there is no way to eat. She has to wait until the work is completed. In addition, the director, Xu Weibang, is very meticulous in his work, requiring the actress's facial expressions to be frantic, terrified, and even to the point of unconsciousness in order to be satisfactory. Therefore, she has suffered a lot for this film, and the fatigue is indescribable. Her words are true, and they are also very clever and insightful.

### Dedication to the Motherland

— Qi Hua

"The Sun Never Sets"

"The Sun Never Sets" — This is a boast of the British Empire, bragging that their colonial flags always fly under the sun, as if the sun never sets. In movies, there are also many examples of propaganda for the might of the imperial army, and the most prominent is Kipling's "Gunga Din." In "Dedication to the Motherland," the Randolph family has repeatedly made meritorious contributions to the empire for three hundred years, until the little Van Brook, who did not want to "join the army," also dedicated himself to the motherland with Bessie Layspon!

However, now the situation in Europe (and the world) is like this, and Chamberlain's policy is like this. The British Empire's boast of conquering colored people seems to be just a fascination with skeletons. The playwright of "Dedication to the Motherland" is even more evasive, pushing the culprit of destroying world peace to the warmongering of arms dealers, while ignoring the aggressors who are carrying out the destruction of world peace. Encouraging people to serve the country is worthy of praise, but it is not the boasting of "The Sun Never Sets." It should move from the narrow sense of dedication to the motherland to engaging in a broad anti-aggression movement to achieve true world peace!

Director Roland Lee's handling is not very good either. First, the entire story is supported by heavy dialogue, which leads to a dull atmosphere. Second, the scene divisions are not compact enough, so the entire script becomes three separate segments. As for individual scenes, the scene when little Van Brook is at the door with his family is quick and concise. The air on the rainy night during Helen's pregnancy, when little Van Brook falsely claims that headquarters ordered Bessie Ricephone to return, and the emotional turmoil of each person, as well as the brothers' big argument and little Van Brook's farewell to his brother and sister-in-law, are quite moving. After the plane bombing, the close-ups of Leon Adderley and others who died in the radio station are very strong and powerful.

Among the actors, little Van Brook is very good at grasping the personality changes in the three different periods. Bessie Ricephone, Leon Adderly, and actresses Virginia Fair and Barbara O'Neill are all mediocre.

Random Notes from an Artist

### Ms. Yin Xing Gu Meijun Talks About: Fragments of Memories (Part 2)

— Leng Fang recorded

During my school days, my given name was Jiao Tianchan. The new name Meijun came about quite ridiculously. Because under the general old concept, some people were still afraid that daughters learning to sing opera and make movies was not very good, so when I went to sign up for the Star Opera Company, I walked on the road while thinking: "My birthday is in December, which is a season of plum blossoms, so I will decide to change my name to Meijun." I didn't expect that the two words Meijun, which came to mind immediately, would become my stage name for life.

Singing Beijing opera was the thing I was most interested in in my early years. I have performed more than a dozen roles as a female lead, such as "Fenhe Bay," "The Little Shepherd Boy," "Meilong Town," "The Festive Phoenix," and "Fighting Puguan." Although I mostly dared to do it without seeking a deep understanding, I may not have been able to perform well in all of them, but I learned quickly in terms of singing, gestures, and stage movements, and I never saw myself as weaker than others. When I later filmed movies, I not only felt the same excitement, but I also did not want to belittle myself. I thought that just like learning Beijing opera, as long as I focused my attention, it would not be difficult to achieve greater success. Unexpectedly, this filming work seemed easy but was actually difficult, especially difficult to master. To this day, although I have filmed many movies, in fact, it is far from my ideal. In my opinion, I am very disappointed that there is not a single work that is more commendable.

Now, I often think to myself: I am really one who is "smart when young." My screen performance in the past few years has simply not improved much. I feel very ashamed, and the reaction of this ashamed mentality is to further strengthen my determination to work hard and fight. Really, when I think of the direction I asked for myself in my early years, it is too far off. I have to quickly and urgently intensify my efforts under the impetus of the shame in my heart.
