Editorial

### Welcoming May

May 1st, as Labor Day, transcends national borders and class prejudices, and is a widely recognized and respected memorial day throughout the world. It has been observed in China for over a decade, and is referred to as "May First." Following May First are other days, such as "May Third," "May Fourth," "May Seventh," "May Ninth," and "May Thirtieth," each with its own well-known history and familiar name. In addition, there is May Fifth and May Fifteenth. During this month of May, what is commemorated in China is either revolution, martyrs, labor movements, cultural movements, massacres, or national humiliation. From May First to May Thirtieth, there are as many as eight different commemorations. Although they differ in nature and object, they all occurred within the past twenty-odd years. May in China is truly a special season.

Looking back, in the days when warlords ruled and unification was not yet achieved, those in power were always particularly vigilant during this special season, as if worries would accompany May. Those below were particularly active during this special season, as if May would bring hope. Thinking back now, not only are the historical facts vividly present, but the scenes of each annual memorial day, whether solemn, gloomy, inspiring, chaotic, joyous, or tragic, with flags at half-mast, gatherings and parades, slogans, martial law, and the lifting of martial law, are all as if they happened just last night. Even in the early days of the Nationalist government's capital in Nanjing, although it no longer viewed this season with fear, it still took it very seriously. What were the concerns and fears of those in power? Nothing other than their own awareness of being distant from the people and acting against public opinion, causing them to feel uneasy and take precautions. Until last May, the scenes of fear and seriousness of previous years were reversed, and there was a generally vibrant atmosphere.

Now, at the beginning of this special season of 1939, we will predict the peace of this season. "May First" has an international nature and will naturally not be affected by China's situation alone, affecting the meaning of Labor Day as a whole. However, Labor Day is most likely to trigger the impulses of the labor community. This is certainly possible in other countries, but absolutely unimaginable for the Chinese labor community this year. As for "May Third," the subjective and objective commemorative values of all the historical facts being commemorated, even if they are compared and weighed one by one, the people of previous years had their own reasons for not wanting to weigh the value of the commemorations but insisting on commemorating them. To analyze it, dissatisfaction with reality was transformed into various forms of movement to shake, change, or correct reality, this being one reason. Agitating, awakening, calling on, promoting, and organizing society, this being another. Signaling the authorities, either complaining and criticizing, or expressing suppressed feelings, or wholeheartedly supporting, or offering well-intentioned encouragement, this being another. Showing the outside world to demonstrate the unforgettable nature of hatred, to show the invincibility of popular sentiment, and to seek freedom and equality for the nation, this being another. Having no ability to exert effort or vent feelings, they sought temporary pleasure, this being another. These five points are the reasons why various commemorative days were seized as opportunities. In previous Mays, many incidents occurred for these reasons, but this May will be different. China's war of resistance has lasted for twenty-two months, and the declared goals are military priority and victory priority. Therefore, apart from the reality of the war of resistance, there is nothing that is not an indispensable reality. Even in terms of the government and society, it cannot be denied that they are both advancing towards the declared goals. Is there anyone who is dissatisfied with the war of resistance and seeks to shake, change, or correct it? Is there anyone who is criticizing the authorities? In the face of the great disaster, only the practical human and material resources are exhausted to meet it. Is there a need to spread it through banners, gatherings, writing, or speech? Is it said that in the face of the reality of the war of resistance, there is still no ability to exert effort or vent feelings, and that effort and venting are directed at commemoration? Towards foreign countries, is there a stronger expression of this war of resistance, or a more effective expression than this war of resistance? China's five thousand years of history, which it has always been proud of, naturally has its indelible value. Everything after the 1911 Revolution naturally has its place in history. However, compared to the current war of resistance and nation-building, which is a great undertaking unparalleled in its past and future, the historical facts that should be commemorated in May cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Taking a step back, since the goal today is military priority and victory priority, that is, the will should be concentrated, and the strength should be concentrated. Therefore, what could be commemorated before the war of resistance is at least what there is no time to commemorate during the war of resistance. Why is there no time? Immerse yourself in the war of resistance! To welcome May and spread it in form is, if not disheartening, at least not necessary for immersing oneself.

### Pittman's Suggestion to Sanction Aggressor Nations - Chongqing Side Finds It Satisfactory

External Spokesman Says:

All Countries Should Immediately Take Effective Action to Safeguard Individual and Common Interests

(Chongqing) US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman's suggestion to authorize the President to impose trade sanctions on countries that undermine the Nine-Power Treaty is viewed here with satisfaction. An external spokesman said, "Pittman's suggestion is undeniably important for human peace and welfare. The Nine-Power Treaty is the only principle for lasting peace in the Far East. If China's integrity is undermined, it is difficult for us to foresee the continued 'open door' policy in China. Japan's violation of the rights of third countries has shown the correctness of this observation. Since negotiations with Japan by various countries have been ineffective, effective action should be taken immediately to safeguard individual and common interests. All firm attitudes at present are sufficient to prevent Japan from taking new acts of aggression. If Pittman's suggestion is accepted, it will definitely sanction Japan. If the US stops supplying Japan with war materials, Japan's combat capability will be greatly weakened." (30th Associated Press dispatch)

Another Diplomatic Action by Roosevelt

### Will Host a Banquet for European Countries - Accept Hitler's Request - Conclude Non-Aggression Pacts Separately with Germany - Western Hemisphere Countries to Issue Joint Declaration

(Washington) According to消息 here last night, US President Roosevelt will launch another diplomatic action. He will have the United States, together with the twenty-one countries of Latin America, issue a declaration asking European countries to accept Hitler's invitation to conclude non-aggression treaties with Germany. The European countries referred to here are the thirty-one countries mentioned by President Roosevelt in his telegram to Hitler and Mussolini on April 15. The Latin American countries are those that endorsed Roosevelt's telegram at the time. Observers believe that this action by the countries of the Western Hemisphere is clearly in support of Britain and France in their preparation to accept Hitler's proposal to conclude non-aggression treaties, as the countries accepting Hitler's request must either negotiate these non-aggression treaties and respect them, or bear the responsibility of rejecting peace talks. (30th Associated Press dispatch)

(London) According to news here today, Britain, France, Poland and several other countries will accept Hitler's invitation to conclude non-aggression pacts. However, efforts by Britain, France and Poland to contain Germany will continue without letup. It is said that the British government is giving special consideration to the expressions of goodwill towards Britain in Hitler's speech, studying the possibility of improving British-German relations. The British government will also ask Germany to explain the meaning of its so-called understanding between Britain and Germany. (30th Associated Press dispatch)

(Paris) According to diplomatic sources, Britain may join France in giving Germany assurances of non-aggression in order to counter Hitler's claim in his speech that democratic countries are trying to encircle Germany. It is believed that Hitler would find it difficult to reject such an assurance. Observers point out that this move by Britain and France is a natural follow-up to Roosevelt's peace appeal to Hitler and Mussolini. (30th Associated Press dispatch)

### America Must Strengthen Its Military to Cope with Future International Crises

(Washington) As of yesterday, reactions from the US Congress and officials to Hitler's speech to the German Reichstag remained unusually divided. However, most well-informed sources believe that the Polish issue is particularly serious compared to all other European issues. This is because Hitler's statements and various actions regarding his policies, especially his attempts to abandon the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and the German demands on Warsaw, require a decisive official response. The direct impact of Hitler's speech on the United States is to make the US focus on its military rearmament plan, emphasizing naval and air power to prepare for potential world crises. The US will continue to view with suspicion the political and economic tendencies of the Nazi and Fascist groups in South America. The government is expected to adopt a more flexible neutrality policy, so that it can provide greater substantial assistance to European democracies in the event of a war. Washington officials are said to be paying close attention to Japan's connection with the Rome-Berlin Axis, as there has been no clear indication of a non-European appeasement policy. Officials also stated that Hitler's speech places the international barometer just above the storm point. One official said that whether "we rise or fall depends on action, not just words." He also indicated that Poland is the immediate focal point for a potential crisis. (April 30, Associated Press)

### British Cabinet to Hold Special Meeting Today to Discuss International Situation

(London) The Prime Minister of Southern Ireland, de Valera, originally planned to visit the United States, but has now postponed the trip due to anxieties in Southern Ireland regarding the implementation of conscription in Northern Ireland and the status of Irish people in England. However, these anxieties in Southern Ireland are expected to dissipate soon. It is reported that the British government is willing to avoid any actions that could harm British-Irish relations. Therefore, the implementation of conscription in Northern Ireland will be postponed indefinitely. As for the Irish in England, all those born in Britain and registered have military service obligations. (April 29, Reuters)

### Baldwin Observes That a European War Is Almost Inevitable

Whether Peace Can Be Achieved Depends on Hitler's Attitude

(New York) Lord Baldwin, former British Prime Minister, and his wife, after traveling through Canada to the United States, are scheduled to board the "Aquitania" ship here today to return home. Before his departure, he told reporters that President Roosevelt's telegram was a "courageous move." He believes that war is inevitable, and the key to whether the current problems can be resolved lies with the German leader Hitler alone. However, "no one can predict what Hitler intends to do in the future," he said. (April 20, Havas)

### German Army Commander-in-Chief Visits Rome

Discussing Unified Military Command and Visiting North Africa

(Rome) General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, leading several officers, arrived here yesterday afternoon. This morning, he met with King Victor Emmanuel III and held a long conversation with Prime Minister Mussolini. It is scheduled that tomorrow he will fly to the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa, accompanied by General Pariani, Minister of War and Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, to visit Governor Balbo. He is scheduled to stay there for six days. It is reported that the German and Italian generals will inspect various military facilities in Libya and study the strategic situation in North Africa. It is said that General Pariani recently went to Innsbruck, Austria, to talk with General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces. Now that General Brauchitsch has come to Italy, the goal is probably to change the existing German-Italian consultations into a military alliance treaty to respond to the collective security agreement to be established by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is also rumored that when war breaks out in the future, the German and Italian navies and armies will be unified in command to increase efficiency. After General Brauchitsch returns from Libya, he will talk with General Pariani, Chief of the General Staff, and Admiral Cavagnari, Minister of the Navy. This move may be related to the issue of unified command. It is even rumored that the German fleet cruising in the western Mediterranean will come to Italian ports before returning home.

### New York World's Fair Opens, Roosevelt Delivers Speech, Saying the US Wishes to Maintain Close Ties with Peaceful Nations

(New York) At the opening of the New York World's Fair today, President Roosevelt said in his speech that he often prays to God that the barriers to communication between many countries on the European continent, from which the Americans came to this hemisphere, can be broken down within a few years. The United States has always been connected with the stars of international goodwill, the most important of which is the star of peace. This exhibition has the theme of "The World of Tomorrow," and the world sees it as the highest and most optimistic gesture of the United States towards internationalism. It is said that the exhibition contains exhibits from 62 countries, which is the largest in the history of world's fairs. It is expected that the number of visitors today will exceed one million.

The New York World's Fair opened tonight, and its electric lights will be lit by cosmic rays from outside the solar system. Dr. Albert Einstein, a famous German scientist, used a device to extract cosmic rays and will deliver a speech that will be broadcast to the world via radio. At that time, the tall column in the center of the square will emit ten beams of light, the last of which will be as bright as one million 100-watt light bulbs. It will be visible for 20 miles around, and a bell will also sound, with its light also visible for 20 miles. (April 30, Reuters)

### Anti-Aggression Group Organized, British-Soviet Negotiations Take a Sharp Turn, Germany Extends Influence to Baltic Coast, Soviet Union Warns Latvia and Estonia

(London) Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax last night. It is said that Maisky suggested that Britain and France should send troops to guarantee the independence of countries bordering the western frontier of the Soviet Union when they are attacked by Germany. The countries listed by the Soviet Union for guarantees include Latvia, Estonia, and Finland in the Baltic Sea. After Britain and France assume this obligation, the Soviet Union is willing to form a military alliance with Britain and France. Whenever Germany attacks Britain, France, or the countries guaranteed by Britain and France, the Soviet Union is willing to send troops to assist. It is said that the Soviet Union is also willing to take joint action with Britain and France in the event of a German attack on Belgium, the Netherlands, or Switzerland. (April 30, Associated Press)

(Paris) The right-wing Parisian Echo newspaper recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent, stating that "The talks conducted by Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky with Foreign Secretary Halifax are of great importance. It is reported that the ambassador told Foreign Secretary Halifax that Soviet Russia suggested that measures should be taken to ensure the security of the Baltic coastal countries (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia). This suggestion has now been approved in principle by Poland. Regarding how the Soviet Union should provide assistance to Poland in the event of an invasion in the future, both parties have also agreed on a compromise plan, that is, the Soviet Union should supply Poland with raw materials and munitions, but its troops will not invade Polish territory. As for the proposal for the Soviet Air Force to assist Poland, it has not been completely abandoned. In addition, in terms of the Far East issue, the Soviet Union has reportedly agreed to deal with the European situation separately. If a Japanese newspaper also publishes a dispatch from its London correspondent, roughly stating that "The negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are about to produce concrete results. The Soviet Union previously proposed that the agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union should involve the threat posed by Japan to the eastern border of the Soviet Union. Up to now, given that Japan is focusing all its attention on China and has no time to spare, it is said that it is still hesitant to collude with the Axis powers of Germany and Italy to fight against European countries that love peace and are determined to resist aggression. If so, the Soviet Union can have no worries about the East and can only establish an agreement with Britain on the relationship in the West." The Progressive Socialist Party's newspaper, Affaires, reported that "The talks between British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday went smoothly. A thorough understanding between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is not far off. According to London's view, after Germany announced the abolition of the 1934 Polish-German Non-Aggression Pact, Poland had to rely on the Soviet Union." (April 30, Havas)

(Paris) Observers here recently stated that Germany is continuing to pursue a policy of eastward expansion. After acquiring the Memel region, it is sending overtures to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. This strategy has been detected by the Soviet government, which has filed representations with the governments of Latvia and Estonia, informing them that if they approach Germany in the future, the Soviet Union will regard it as an unfriendly act. As for the fact that the Soviet Union and Lithuania are not contiguous, it did not make the same representations to them, but if Germany were to use the Baltic coastal countries to directly or indirectly extend its influence to the Soviet border, it would not be tolerated by the Soviet Union. As of today, now that Germany has announced the abolition of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, not only has the possibility of Poland and the Soviet Union approaching each other increased, but the friendship between Poland and Hungary, which was originally very close, has also changed as a result. This is because the closer Hungary becomes to Germany in the future, the more difficult it will be for Poland to maintain its original relationship with it. In short, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe originally held a hesitant attitude towards the two major European groups. Now, after Hitler's speech, these countries can clearly decide what to do. (April 30, Havas)

### Poland Notifies France of Its Determination to Resist Aggression, The Lesson of the Fall of Czechoslovakia Is Not Far Away, Seeking a Fair Solution to the Danzig Problem

(Paris) Poland formally notified France last night that it was determined to oppose Germany's annexation of Danzig or the Polish Corridor. The Polish note stated that Hitler's attempt to abolish the Polish-German friendship treaty would in no way diminish Poland's belief in its own strength and its reliance on the guarantees made by Britain and France. Some believe that this note is to warn Britain and France, hoping that they are prepared to fulfill their obligations to Poland once Germany attacks Danzig and the Polish Corridor. (April 30, Associated Press)

Warsaw Politicians have commented on the relationship between Poland and Germany, saying that although the Czech Republic made various concessions, it was still unable to avoid the disaster of partition. The lesson is not far away, and Poland must defend itself. However, regarding the two issues of the Free City of Danzig and the construction of a highway by Germany through the Polish Corridor, Poland is still willing to consider a fair solution in a spirit of understanding, so that both parties can accept it. Foreign Minister Beck, after visiting the United Kingdom in early April, has repeatedly tried to talk with German Ambassador Moltke for this purpose, but he has not been able to do so because the ambassador has returned to his country to report on his duties. At this moment, the Polish government is actively making preparations in military and economic terms to prevent problems before they arise. This can be seen in the air combat exercise to be held tomorrow at the Gdynia airfield. (April 29, Havas)

### Polish Authorities Consider Reply to Germany, Beck to Announce Policy Toward Germany in Parliament

Warsaw After Germany abolished the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, the Polish government has convened a joint meeting of the Senate and the House of Representatives on May 5 to hear Foreign Minister Beck's speech and the government's reply. Although the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are scheduled to meet first on May 2, Foreign Minister Beck will not reveal the contents of the reply. He will only announce it to the diplomatic corps and reporters at the joint meeting of the Senate and the House of Representatives on May 5. In short, the Foreign Minister will follow the example of German leader Hitler, and the reply will be sent to the German government a few minutes before the speech is delivered. (April 30, Havas)

Warsaw It is currently stated by officials that Hitler's statement in yesterday's speech that he had proposed a twenty-five-year non-aggression pact to Poland and that Germany, Poland, and Hungary had jointly guaranteed Slovakia is not true. Hitler is simply trying to create difficulties between Britain and Poland. Polish officials have not changed their attitude towards Germany's demand for Danzig to return to Germany and for the construction of a highway through the Polish Corridor to reach Danzig. If Hitler wants to scare Poland with this, he will fail. According to the Warsaw Daily, the sales of Polish national defense bonds have increased greatly after Hitler's speech. As far as is known, officials have not yet adopted new defense measures. (April 29, Reuters)

### Germany Uses Both Threats and Enticements on Poland

(Berlin) After German leader Hitler delivered his speech, newspapers and Nazi Party members said that Poland should no longer reject "Germany's final and generous proposal." It is clear that Germany will take action against Poland before this autumn. Nazi Party members even declared that "this proposal to Poland must be accepted immediately, otherwise it will become a fait accompli in an instant, and there will be no regrets." This is the same as the warning issued by the party to Czechoslovakia last year. Party members also said that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csaky are now in Berlin, holding talks with German authorities. This move is tantamount to warning Poland that Hungary's friendship is unreliable. Moreover, according to unconfirmed reports, Prime Minister Teleki brought a proposal approved by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, advocating that Slovakia be merged into Hungarian territory, and that this be used as an exchange condition for Germany's wishes for Poland. The Italian side has also directly advised Poland that "the current environment is already unsustainable, and Poland should not stubbornly stick to its prejudices and bring trouble upon itself." In short, it is generally believed here that Poland may accept the final proposal put forward by Hitler, but Britain must give a negative answer to Germany's abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the resumption of negotiations. In fact, the leaders of the Nazi Party do not expect Britain and Poland to provide answers. The reason for acting in this way is obviously to reserve a loophole, so that when they take action in the future, they can use the excuse that other countries refused to accept their generous proposals and attribute all responsibility to other countries. This is Germany's intention. (April 29, Havas)

Warsaw According to news from Italy and Germany, the British government recently sent a note to Poland, roughly stating that the establishment of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain and Poland was not intended to encourage Poland to adopt a tough attitude and refuse to accept "Germany's reasonable and fair proposals." This statement has been denied by the semi-official Patriotic News Agency. The British government did not submit such a note. At the time of the establishment of the mutual assistance agreement between Britain and Poland, Germany had already made proposals on the two issues of the Free City of Danzig and the construction of a highway through the Polish Corridor, and Poland had also stated its position. As for Germany's promise to guarantee Poland's border for a period of 25 years, the German government had never formally proposed it before Hitler's speech on April 28. In addition, the Pat Agency also denied the news from the German side that the Italian government had advised the Polish government that Poland's "situation is unsustainable, and if it continues to stick to its prejudices, it may lead to a crisis."

### Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Busily Travels

Actively Engaged in Diplomatic Activities with Small Balkan Countries

(Istanbul, Turkey) The new German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, presented his credentials to President Ismet this morning. Yesterday afternoon, the President met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin and had talks. It is reported that Potemkin will travel to the capital of Bulgaria, and it is possible that he will also go to Romania. Diplomatic circles here are paying close attention to this trip. Officials have remained absolutely silent about the goal of this trip so far, but well-informed sources say that the Soviet Union is unwilling to interfere in any issues within the scope of the Balkan Peninsula, and the initial motivation for Potemkin's trip is probably to visit and investigate. However, since Germany extended its influence to the Black Sea, the Soviet Union has shifted its attention to Bulgaria. Potemkin's trip to that country shows that the Soviet Union's attitude towards Balkan affairs is about to become more active. In addition, the Soviet Union and Turkey both have common interests in the Black Sea, and their relationship is very close. This is a very important factor in the diplomatic activities of organizing an anti-aggression group. (April 30, Havas)

### Papen Meets Turkish President to Present Credentials

Istanbul The new German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, met with Turkish President Ismet yesterday morning to present his credentials. Papen conveyed Hitler's friendship and goodwill to the Turkish President and said, "This ambassador will devote himself to developing friendship between the two countries and promoting cultural and economic relations between Turkey and Germany." (April 30, Huitong)

### Important Changes Among Russian Naval Leaders

(Moscow) The following senior Soviet naval officers have recently been reassigned: (1) Naval People's Commissar Frinovsky has resigned. His vacancy has been filled by Admiral Kuznetsov, Commander of the Pacific Fleet. (2) Naval People's Commissariat members Shaposhnikov and Smirnov have been dismissed at the same time. Their vacancies have been filled by Reivkenko, Commander of the Baltic Fleet, and Rogoten, Director of the Political Bureau of the Naval People's Commissariat. (3) Naval People's Commissar Deputy Isakov has been promoted to First Deputy Commissar of the Naval People's Commissariat. (April 9, Havas)

### French and Polish Talks Fruitful, Romanian Foreign Minister Leaves Paris for Rome to Consult

(Paris) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu left here today for Rome to continue his tour of European capitals. After Rome, he plans to go to the capital of Yugoslavia. Gafencu expressed his satisfaction with the results of his talks in London and Paris, saying that he was deeply moved by Britain and France's great aspirations for peace. A communiqué issued here today stated that the French-Romanian talks allowed for a thorough study of all relations between the two countries, and emphasized the maintenance of European peace. French and Polish diplomatic authorities were pleased to find that their opinions coincided. (April 9, Reuters)

(Rome) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu has departed from Paris and come here to hold talks with Italian authorities. Fascist Party members attach great importance to this, hoping that the outcome of the talks will allow Romania to join the German-Italian Axis, so that the oil produced in that country can be controlled by Germany and Italy. They also said that since Italy supported Hungary's demands for border revisions, the friendship between Romania and Italy has been affected. It is hoped that Hungary and Romania can reach a compromise on the Hungarian minority issue in Outer Transylvania (which belonged to Hungary before the European War), which will benefit Romanian-Italian relations. Regarding the Romanian oil issue, the tone of Italian newspapers is noteworthy. For example, the Fascist Party's newspaper "Del Viale" studied the importance of Romanian oil in wartime, roughly stating that Romania ranks fifth among the world's oil-producing countries, and Germany and [Austria-]Hungary occupied it during the European War because of their need for oil. "Now that Germany and Italy are launching a counterattack against Britain's encirclement policy, although there are not many days left, they have resolved several problems. How can they admit failure on the Romanian issue?" (April 9, Havas)

### German-Hungarian Talks Seek to Promote Hungarian Understanding

(Berlin) Although the contents of the German-Hungarian talks were not announced last night, political circles here believe that economic issues must occupy an important position. This can be inferred from the two decisions of Hungarian politicians to meet with General Göring, the economic dictator of four years. German-Hungarian economic relations are now very prosperous, and trade figures have increased fourfold compared to 1933. In the future, systematic development should be sought. Economic circles hinted that Germany and Hungary may sign an agreement similar in nature to the German-Romanian commercial agreement, so as to develop Hungarian production and promote it in the German market. It is generally believed that in addition to economic issues, the relationship between Hungary and Yugoslavia will also be considered. German foreign policy has always been based on promoting an understanding between Hungary and Yugoslavia, with Hungary giving up its territorial demands and Yugoslavia guaranteeing its Hungarian minority. If so, Yugoslavia will definitely be able to join the International Anti-Communist Pact. (April 30, Huitong)

### Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Result in Agreement to Cooperate in Aiding China; Anti-Aggression Bloc Does Not Include the Far East; Britain to Expand Financial Aid to China

(London) After the Soviet Ambassador Maisky returned to his post from Moscow yesterday, he visited senior officials of the Foreign Office today for talks. The Sunday Times commented on this matter, stating that regarding the issue of forming an anti-aggression bloc, an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union is imminent. Germany's attempt to transform the Anti-Comintern Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan into a military alliance has reportedly been rejected by Japan. However, if Britain and the Soviet Union cooperate not only in Europe but also take united action in the Far East, Japan might change its attitude. Although the Soviet Union once insisted that the Far East should be included in the anti-aggression bloc, it no longer does so. The reason for this is that Britain and the Soviet Union have already reached an agreement on providing aid to China. It can be asserted that Britain will expand its financial aid to China in the short term. (Havas Dispatch, 29th)

### Tokyo Resentment Intensifies; Incitement Against Britain

(Tokyo) Although Japanese newspapers have been extremely hostile to the deployment of the American fleet to the Pacific in the past week, their antipathy towards Britain is even greater. According to the Miyako Shimbun, "The United States is clearly being used by Britain, and there is no doubt that Britain intends to stand in opposition to Japan. Therefore, the situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly tense. Although Japan does not like war, if forced to do so, Japan will not hesitate in the slightest. In short, Britain's support for General Chiang Kai-shek is a major cause of a potential Anglo-Japanese war." The newspaper further stated, "Although there is no animosity between the United States and Japan, it is regrettable that the United States is being used by Britain in the Far East." According to the Kokumin Shimbun, Britain's cooperation with the Soviet Union is clearly an anti-Japanese act. If Britain continues to do so, "Japan's anti-British sentiment will inevitably increase." It is expected that the Japanese authorities will take retaliatory action against British interests in China. (Associated Press Dispatch, 30th)

### Difficulties in Implementing Japanese Military Budget; Wartime Prices Soar; Impact on Industrial Production

(Tokyo) The implementation of Japan's huge military budget is currently encountering many difficult problems domestically. The increased demand for military materials is the main cause of the rising prices of various materials. All materials needed to manufacture goods that are also needed by the arms industry are increasing in price. According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, if this upward trend continues unabated, "the implementation of the government's low-price policy will be hindered." The newspaper supports the deep concern of the Japanese Army and Navy authorities in implementing measures to reduce the prices of military materials. The Japanese Navy authorities recently stated at a meeting with leaders of private arms factories that there is a need for an automatic price reduction of at least ten percent in arms prices. At the same time, they instructed relevant naval officers to monitor the implementation of price reductions for military supplies. The Army authorities are cooperating with the Navy and are currently carefully considering how to reduce the prices of their huge consumption of materials, and are discussing: (1) reducing prices, (2) establishing an official system for reviewing the accounts of private arms factories, (3) reducing the dividends issued by these factories, and (4) promoting savings among arms manufacturing workers. Army Minister Itagaki firmly stated that adjusting the prices of military materials is of utmost importance for the smooth implementation of the military budget and the adjustment of arms manufacturing materials. The way this matter is handled will determine the success or failure of the government's wartime price policy. Due to the surge in demand for military materials and commodities necessary for implementing the government's plan to expand national productive capacity, prices in Japan have been soaring for some time. The quantity of materials consumed by the military and the government was already large. Judging from the current situation, the quantity of materials needed by the Army in this newly started fiscal year will be even greater than before. Unless the authorities make a firm resolution to reduce the prices of military materials, how to supply this year's military needs will be a difficult problem to solve satisfactorily. Since the China Incident has entered the stage where Japan is conducting military operations, construction work must also be undertaken. Therefore, in the next few years, the number of war materials and commodities needed for the expansion of productive capacity program will be very large. Therefore, from the perspective of ensuring the supply of these materials, stabilizing people's lives, and maintaining social order, reducing the unit price of military materials is a matter of urgency. Otherwise, there will be no way to rectify the current situation of the arms industry's prosperity while other industries are in recession, and to prevent malignant inflation.

### U.S. to Impose Punitive Tariffs on Japanese Goods; Treasury Investigating Japanese Import Trade

(Washington) According to news from here today, the Treasury Department is currently investigating goods imported into the United States from Japan and Italy. It is likely that a 25% punitive tariff will be imposed on Japanese and Italian goods, as the United States has already increased this punitive tariff on most German goods. Treasury officials also stated that they are currently studying the strict exchange control measures of various countries and are looking for evidence of Japanese dumping of Japanese goods in the United States, so that the President will have more reasons to implement punitive tariffs on Japanese goods. Various parties here believe that the Treasury Department's current work is the United States' preparation to take similar retaliatory actions against Japan's undermining of American interests in China. Regardless of Congress's intentions, the U.S. government has the right to take this action. It is only necessary for the Treasury Department to present evidence that Japan is violating American trade rules, and the President can reduce Japan's trade with the United States. For example, the punitive tariff currently levied by the United States on goods imported from Germany was not passed by Congress. Judging from this, it will not be difficult for the U.S. government to impose similar punitive tariffs on Japanese and Italian goods. Therefore, regardless of whether Congress can pass the Pittman Act, Japanese goods imported into the United States will inevitably be subject to restrictions. (Associated Press Dispatch, 29th)

### Philippine Industrialist's Prediction; The Future of the Philippines

San Francisco: Mr. Masman, a former president of the Mining Association and capitalist from Manila, told reporters today that he was concerned about Japan's deep penetration into South China and the country's southern expansion policy, saying, "Due to the Philippines' geographical location, Japan may attempt to seize the Philippines before attacking Indochina or the Dutch East Indies." Mr. Masman arrived here yesterday from Manila and is en route to New York. (Associated Press Dispatch, 30th)

### Yugoslavia: A Triune Kingdom

Italy's decision to annex Albania is both to consolidate its position in the Mediterranean and to threaten Yugoslavia. Several years ago, Italy instructed Albania to build military roads directly to the border of the southern country, indicating that Italy had long coveted it. When the invasion occurred, Britain and France declared their guarantee of the independence of Poland, Greece, and Romania, but did not mention or consider the difficult situation of Yugoslavia, perhaps because they did not want to add to the trouble. Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania are all members of the Little Entente. Since Czechoslovakia was annexed, its northern border has been controlled by the Nazis, while its western coast and southern border are threatened by Italy. The port of Zara on the Adriatic coast has also been ceded to Italy. In the east, it has old grievances with Hungary and Bulgaria due to border issues. On the other hand, internally, there are many ethnic complexities and divisions. Considering the demise of Czechoslovakia, one cannot help but worry about the future of Yugoslavia. The land of Yugoslavia was originally part of Turkish territory. The Treaty of Berlin in 1878 stipulated that Serbia should secede from Turkey and become independent. Prince Milan Obrenović declared independence in Belgrade and established the Kingdom of Serbia. In 1882, he added the title of King. Later, the Slovaks, Croats, Dalmatians, and Bosnians revolted in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and declared independence. In 1918, they merged with Serbia and Montenegro to form the triune Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which is Yugoslavia. Therefore, in addition to the aforementioned ethnic groups, there are also Romanians, Albanians, Bulgarians, Macedonians, Hungarians, Jews, etc. Its area is 96,737 square miles, and its population is over 14 million. Serbs account for over 5 million, Croats over 4 million, and Germans 500,000. Although the constitution stipulates that all ethnic groups are equal, the King is the former ruler of Serbia, and the majority of cabinet members are also Serbs, so other ethnic groups are not satisfied. The Croats, whose culture and industry are more advanced than the Serbs, have repeatedly demanded autonomy, which is a hidden reef in Yugoslavia's internal politics. Recently, a compromise has been reached to grant the Croats autonomy. Yugoslavia's ethnic groups are complex, and the education of its people is relatively backward in Europe. According to a survey in 1931, the illiteracy rate in the country was still 45% of the total population. Its mineral and industrial production is far inferior to that of Czechoslovakia. Farmers account for 80% of the population, and only 30% of the country's land is cultivated. The total value of international trade is only 100 million U.S. dollars a year, which is only one-third of that of Czechoslovakia. In terms of military strength, although it can mobilize one million people in wartime, it may be difficult to maintain peace for long under the watchful eyes of the fascists. Several years ago, France was very close to Yugoslavia in order to prevent Italy. In October 1924, King Alexander I of Yugoslavia formally returned the visit to France, but he was assassinated upon landing in Marseille. The current King Peter II is his son. Italy has recently been seeking to benefit from the South. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met with the Yugoslav Foreign Minister in Venice, and Yugoslavia's compromise with Italy has been realized. Germany is also trying to win over Yugoslavia in order to divide the Little Entente in the Balkans. Whether Yugoslavia will further join the Anti-Comintern Pact is very important to the current situation in the Balkans, but according to reports, Yugoslavia has rejected it.

### French Newspaper in Nanjing Sympathizes with China's Resistance; Punished with a Ten-Day Suspension

Nanjing: The French newspaper "Journal de Shanghai," published here, was suspended for ten days yesterday for publishing an article on the war in China. The author of the article, Dr. Roul Pia, expressed pessimism about Japan's current situation, stating that China is not comparable to Albania, and Japan has now tasted this bitterness and paid a huge price for the lessons it has learned. There is a saying in the Far East that one should die with a smile. Japan's forced support is probably like that. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)

### San Francisco Public Opinion; Prevents Iron from Being Shipped to Japan

(San Francisco) Yesterday, dozens of people who expressed sympathy for China gathered in front of a Japanese cargo ship to protest the shipment of munitions to Japan. The ship is currently loading scrap iron to be shipped to Japan. The protesters were composed of American friends of the Chinese. Their demonstrations echoed the Japanese people's celebration of the Emperor's birthday. (Associated Press Dispatch, 30th)

### Europe Launches Debt Repayment Movement; Romanian Government Notifies U.S. Envoy; Ready to Open Negotiations with the U.S.

Bucharest, Romania: The Romanian government recently notified the U.S. envoy to Romania, declaring that the government is prepared to begin negotiations with the U.S. government immediately on the issue of war debt repayment. U.S. diplomatic circles had predicted several months ago that European countries would begin this debt repayment movement because U.S. law prohibits lending money to countries that have not repaid their previous debts, and these countries are now threatened by war. If Romania's negotiations are successful, the actions that Britain and France will take are of great interest to the general public. The British House of Commons will convene a meeting this week to discuss the issue of war debts. Observers generally believe that European countries are now trying to resolve the issue of war debts with the U.S. so that they can borrow money from the U.S. in the next major war. After the war, most European countries failed to repay their war debts to the United States as scheduled. (Associated Press Dispatch, 30th)

### United States Intensifies Military Expansion; Adding Two New Battleships; Funding Under Review

(Washington) A bill to fund the construction of two of the world's fastest battleships will be submitted to the House after review by the House Appropriations Committee. Each of these ships will have a displacement of 45,000 tons, and the cost of each ship is between $75 million and $105 million. The bill also approves the purchase of 250 new naval aircraft and the construction of six destroyers and six submarines. (Reuters Dispatch, 29th)

### Inventors of New War Equipment Eager to Offer Advice to the Government

Washington: Since the U.S. government launched an expansion of its army and navy, inventors across the country have been offering the Department of the Army methods for manufacturing new types of war equipment and submitting drawings. There are often as many as a thousand cases each month. The construction of new guns, cannons, bombs, aircraft, and other weapons is almost a daily occurrence. According to a department member speaking to news reporters, nearly half of them are of no value, but there are indeed many worth studying, which are currently under close investigation. One inventor suggested building extremely large railroads to carry the U.S. fleet across the continent without having to pass through the Panama Canal. Another inventor suggested reviving the war helmets used by ancient Roman soldiers, improving them to withstand machine gun bullets. (Reuters Dispatch, 29th)

### Pittman Argues U.S. Silver Purchase Law Should Be Maintained

(Washington) Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday urged the Senate Silver Committee to maintain the silver purchase bill because silver occupies an important position in wartime. During the European war, India's lack of revolution was due to the high price of silver, and silver will occupy an even more important position in future wars. Economist Delant also said, "War often increases the need for silver, and although there are no legislative regulations in circulation in the international market, prices will naturally rise." (Associated Press Dispatch, 30th)

### Chinese Army in Shanxi Province Has Gained the Initiative; Guerrillas Briefly Entered Hunyuan; Retreating After Burning Japanese Warehouses

Xingji: The Chinese army guerrillas in the Yanbei area have repeatedly performed miraculous feats. Due to transportation blockades, news is delayed. According to a forward report, a Chinese guerrilla unit attacked Hunyuan on the night of the 13th, entered the city at midnight, and engaged in hand-to-hand combat for three hours, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese soldiers, unable to withstand the attack, abandoned the city and fled. The Chinese side obtained many spoils of war. Hunyuan is the gateway to Datong. All sides are surrounded by Japanese troops. The Chinese side, finding it inconvenient to defend for long, burned the Japanese warehouses and withdrew at dawn. (Dispatch, 30th)

Xingji: The situation in Shanxi is improving. The attacking units have gradually gained the initiative. The results of the battle in southern Shanxi are good. The tasks of attrition and annihilation have been achieved. The Japanese army is in a dilemma, like fish in a cauldron. Strategically, the Chinese army has achieved a major victory. The Japanese army's offensive has sharply decreased, and most of them are firmly defending their strongholds and adopting a defensive posture. In the past two days, only small units have been maneuvering for guerrilla warfare, so there has been no major contact. There have been no changes in the northern sections of the Zhengtai and Tongpu railways. On the night of the 25th, there was fierce fighting all night in the Heilongguan area. The Japanese army resisted stubbornly, and fighting continued until noon on the 26th. The Japanese army in the Yuncheng area of southern Shanxi attempted to counterattack. The Chinese army has been closely monitoring. There has been no contact in Hejin, Jishan, and other places. (Dispatch, 29th)

Xingji: Over a hundred Japanese soldiers from Pianguan advanced towards Hequ on the morning of the 26th. The Chinese army ambushed them in the Yaowangping Changyagou area. By evening, the Japanese army had occupied Yaowangping and continued to invade westward. After the Chinese reinforcements bravely counterattacked, the Japanese army retreated to Yaowangping Yangjialing, where they confronted the Chinese army. There has been no change as of noon on the 27th. Over a hundred Japanese soldiers from Shenchi moved towards Wuzhai in two directions on the 26th. The Japanese army from Jingle also divided into groups and invaded westward, appearing to attack Lanxian. The Chinese army is dividing its forces to counterattack. (Dispatch, 30th)

### Annual Conference of the Textile Society Held in Chongqing

### Japanese Troops in Zhongxiang Failed to Cross the River

Yicheng: There are signs of a resurgence of fighting in central Hubei. Since the 27th, the Japanese have been continuously reinforcing their troops. At the same time, the Japanese troops on the front line have been moving busily. More than a thousand new Japanese troops have been added to the area from Haojiadian in Suixian County to Xujiazhai. More than a thousand Japanese troops have also been added to Huayuan Anlu. Seven or eight hundred Japanese troops from Ying Mountain moved to Maping yesterday. More than a thousand Japanese troops from Anlu opened to Xihe Leigongdian yesterday. Today, more than two hundred Japanese troops have contacted the Chinese army and were killed by the Chinese army, fifty or sixty people. The remnants retreated to the southeast. There are five Japanese cannons in Maping, which fired five or six hundred shells at Huadushan (more than ten miles north of Maping) today. Yesterday, more than two hundred Japanese troops attempted to cross the river in the Zhongxian area but were repelled by the Chinese army. Today, the Japanese army still intends to cross the river, but because the Chinese army gave them artillery fire first, the Japanese have not succeeded. (Dispatch, 30th)

(Hong Kong) Chongqing Dispatch: Yesterday, the Japanese army at Zhongbu Wharf on the Xiang River in central Hubei used six cannons to fiercely bombard the Chinese side to cover two hundred infantrymen in a forced crossing of the river. After fierce shooting by the Chinese army, the Japanese army was repelled in a two-hour battle. At the same time, twenty-five Japanese planes bombed Lengshuipu in batches. (Special Dispatch, 30th)

### Large Numbers of Japanese Planes Fly Over Hunan to Ravage

(Changsha) Taking advantage of the clear weather, large numbers of Japanese planes came to Hunan to wreak havoc. On the morning of the 30th, twenty-seven Japanese planes fled south from Hubei and arrived in Shaoyang around 10 a.m., dropping more than twenty bombs outside the East Gate before heading north.

Kangding Correspondence: Xikang is the most resource-rich and undeveloped region in the southwestern border area. It is not only an important stronghold for national defense at present but also the center of future international transportation. The Ningyuan and Yajiang areas, which were划入康省之寗雅兩屬, are very rich in resources. Xichang is the hub of Ningyuan, and the border area of Sichuan, Kang, and Yunnan provinces is very important. The authorities recently set up the Military Affairs Committee Chairman's Xichang Headquarters here, which shows the authorities' intention to consolidate the frontier and enrich national defense. After the newly appointed Headquarters Director Zhang Bochang was ordered to take office, he departed from Chongqing for Kang. When he passed through Chengdu, people from more than ten counties in the Ningyuan and Yajiang areas who were traveling in Chengdu expressed their great pleasure that the Central Government had set up the Chairman's Headquarters in Xichang to promote the construction of the Southwest. They held a welcome meeting and suggested opinions for reference. Zhang then took a car to the west. Because he had to discuss everything with Kang Chairman Liu Wenhui, he detoured to the province when passing through Ya'an. According to Zhang's talk about his views on Ningyuan, he said that the establishment of the Xichang Headquarters is actually to develop resources in the Ningyuan and Yajiang areas. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and other industries in the area are quite developed, and gold, copper, iron, coal, and other minerals are also produced. The development plan has been roughly formulated, and he plans to start with transportation construction, actively building roads, and plans to establish an industrial technical school in Ningyuan to cultivate border talents in agriculture, forestry, mining, etc. In addition, another group of experts is engaged in surveying and exploration in order to develop and increase production. He met with Chairman Liu yesterday and will have to stay here for a few more days before going directly to Xichang.

### Chaoshan Deploys Resistance Defense Line

Japanese Side Attempts to Invade Chaoshan on May 1st; Japanese Planes Fly Over Chaozhou, Meizhou, and Other Areas to Xiamen

Shantou Correspondence: In late March, Chaoshan and other places repeatedly cracked Japanese sabotage agencies and captured more than ten spies, who confessed that the traitors planned to cause trouble everywhere on May 1st to cater to the Japanese army invading from the Fujian border. Chaoshan Garrison Commander Hua Zhenzhong, in order to plan for everything, forcibly dispersed the population and materials from April 20th. The Shantou market is now in a state of war.

At 9:00 a.m. on April 24th, a total of 24 Japanese bombers and fighter planes flew from the Guangzhou sea via Zijin, Wuhua, Fengshun, Meixian, and Dapu to western Fujian, seemingly flying to Xiamen. On the same day, a Japanese destroyer was moored in the Lingdong Sea, off the Dachahe ferry. Judging from the Japanese side's current actions, there seems to be no sign of an invasion of Shantou, but the military authorities are not relaxing their preparations in any way. The first line of defense configuration along the coast has been completed recently, and the combat configuration of the second defense line is also being completed quickly. Chao'an, Jieyang, and other places have been划入 second defense line. Large troops have been building trenches and other defensive works in various places in recent days. Anbu, Fort, Guanbu, and other towns have also been ordered to evacuate the people. The light vehicle road from Shantou to Chenghai was ordered to be completely destroyed within three days from the 25th. The Chaoshan Railway will be destroyed after receiving the order from the war zone headquarters. The Chenghai local team and police, under the command of County Mayor Bian Zhishan from the 24th to the 29th, conducted live-fire shooting on the Huafu Township embankment and near the city, along the Waisha Township Guanshan Township area. Women and children in the coastal villages had long since been evacuated, leaving only the strong men's team, with the provincial government sending inspector Shen Ziqing to Chenghai for guidance. Hui Chao Mei Garrison Commander Zou Hong arrived in Shantou on the 24th to attend the ceremony for Hua Zhenzhong's assumption of the post of garrison commander and then rushed to Chao'an Dapu and other places for inspection on the 25th. Accompanying Zou was Guo Siyan, the former commander of the Humen Fortress. After losing Humen, there was talk of being wanted for investigation. Now, he is appearing in Chaoshan, or he has been granted a chance to make amends for his crimes. The population of Chaoyang, Huilai, and Lufeng counties continued to evacuate from the 26th.

    （四）打仗，使得球員們集中在香港，今年的足球賽，因而更見熱鬧，足球總會賺了錢，笑口常開，南華會賺了錢，認為流年好、六大錦標華人隊有包辦的把握，球迷們化了錢喊聲痛快，滿意得火氣亦减少了。
(4) The war has caused players to concentrate in Hong Kong, making this year's football matches even livelier. The Football Association is making money and is all smiles. The South China Athletic Association is making money and believes it's a lucky year. They are confident that Chinese teams can take all six major championships. Fans are spending money and shouting with joy, so satisfied that their tempers have also lessened.

李惠堂是聰明人，現在因為踢了十幾年球，相當的「麥克麥克」了，平時坐着一輛不大不小的汽車（號碼四九四九）派頭十足。看看今年來香港的高等難民多，機會難再，於是乎東山再起，名利雙收，何樂而不為。高興的時候，寫幾篇稿子，往中央社一送，隔日各報競刋，互相利用利用，彼此心中有數。
Li Huitang is a smart man. Now, because he has been playing football for over a decade, he is quite "Mike Mike" [wealthy]. Usually, he sits in a car of moderate size (license plate 4949) with a full demeanor. Seeing the many high-level refugees coming to Hong Kong this year, an opportunity not to be missed, he has made a comeback, gaining both fame and fortune. Why not? When he's happy, he writes a few manuscripts, sends them to the Central News Agency, and the next day, newspapers compete to publish them, each using the other to their advantage, and both sides are aware of it.

    不過，李惠堂亦有他的福氣，活該耍走運，說來亦奇怪，老李不踢則巳，一踢終有紀錄的，可是，平心而論，老李假使沒有馮景祥的輸送得宜，恐怕亦不見得如此容易，所謂牡丹雖好，尙須綠葉扶持。
However, Li Huitang also has his good fortune and deserves to have good luck. It's strange to say, but if Old Li doesn't kick, that's it, but if he does kick, there's always a record. But, in all fairness, if Old Li didn't have Feng Jingxiang's proper support, it probably wouldn't be so easy. As the saying goes, even a beautiful peony still needs green leaves to support it.

    由此，又想到那位新李惠堂謝慶福來了，老謝，比從前（三四年前）心廣體胖了，身村相當的魁梧，惟高度比較眞李惠堂差一些，脚頭挺硬的，頭頂功夫亦稱上好；還有一位，敎人怪想念的，中堅朱成貴，滿塲飛馳，位置好，脚頭好，截奪好，輸送好，眞是一個好人兒。
From this, I'm reminded of the new Li Huitang, Xie Qingfu, who has arrived. Old Xie has become more carefree and portly than before (three or four years ago). He has a rather robust physique, but is slightly shorter than the real Li Huitang. His kicking is quite strong, and his header skills are also considered excellent. There's also one that people strangely miss, the center-back Zhu Chenggui, who flies around the field, has good positioning, good kicking, good interception, and good passing. He's truly a good person.

    （五）上海人當還　得，當年的四騎士（李天生·譚江柏·馮景祥·葉北華）英勇的故事，事到如今，李天生和馮景祥仍舊紅得發紫，雖然上了年紀，球藝却更圓滑了，眞够得上「爐火純靑四個字。
(5) Shanghainese should still remember the heroic stories of the Four Knights (Li Tiansheng, Tan Jiangbai, Feng Jingxiang, and Ye Beihua) from those years. Even now, Li Tiansheng and Feng Jingxiang are still very popular. Although they are older, their football skills have become even more refined, truly worthy of the words "reaching a state of perfection."

    江柏現在昆明，偶爾亦玩玩票，談不到大刀闊斧了。葉北華却因戰事影響，從廣東來到了香港，南華會慕名而請之，從此重作馮婦，磨刀再上前綫。當星中華第三戰時，曾代表華聯一度上塲，可是脚頭生疏，往昔威風，大為减色。
Jiang Bai is now in Kunming, occasionally playing for fun, but it's nothing grand. Ye Beihua, however, came to Hong Kong from Guangdong due to the war. The South China Athletic Association invited him out of admiration, and he has since returned to playing, sharpening his sword to return to the front lines. During the third battle of Singapore vs. China, he once represented the Chinese team, but his kicking was rusty, and his former glory was greatly diminished.

聽說：南華會將乘夏季之空閒，還要到南洋去跑一趟，趕空檔，賺外快」，生財有大道。葉北華見獵心喜，連日埋頭苦練，準備一顯身手，俾名利而雙收。
It is said that the South China Athletic Association will take advantage of the summer break to make a trip to Southeast Asia to fill the gap and earn extra money. There's a great way to make money. Ye Beihua is excited by this opportunity and has been practicing hard day after day, preparing to show off his skills and gain both fame and fortune.

    原來，南華的遠征，與分錢的時候，頗有一說的價値，莫慶雖是軍師，却亦是一個獨裁者，每到賽終結賬的時候，先提出一筆「底錢，」譬如每人一百元，大家一律待遇。此外，就耍單看莫慶的手法了，先拿一枝紅筆，在白紙上東割劃西劃劃，對你高興，畫上幾十分，不高興，送你一個湯欄，然後就憑道一些洋碼子，按數分錢，分得多是你有運氣，分得少是你有霉氣，你想反抗，白費，好在南華名氣大，不怕你不靠着他。
Originally, there's quite a story to tell about South China's expeditions and how the money is divided. Although Mo Qing is the strategist, he is also a dictator. Every time the accounts are settled at the end of a tournament, he first proposes a "base amount," for example, 100 yuan per person, which everyone receives equally. After that, it depends on Mo Qing's methods. He first takes a red pen and scribbles on a white sheet of paper. If he likes you, he draws a few dozen points; if he doesn't, he gives you a zero. Then, based on some foreign figures, he distributes the money accordingly. Getting a lot means you're lucky; getting little means you're unlucky. If you want to resist, it's a waste of time. Fortunately, South China has a big reputation and isn't afraid that you won't rely on it.

    總而會之，每當拔師出征的時候，大家因為眼前發着光，無不一團和氣，毫無意見，前隙盡忘。反之，當班師回朝的時候，各懷鬼胎，小伙子肚中多少有點火氣。幸虧獨裁者槍法好，使得你敢怒而不敢吵，敢氣而不敢走。下次再幹時，照樣大家很高興的去，閙着　扭回來。
In summary, whenever the team sets out on an expedition, everyone is excited about the prospects, and they are all in harmony, forgetting past grievances. Conversely, when the team returns, everyone has their own agenda, and the young men are somewhat angry. Fortunately, the dictator is good at handling things, so you dare to be angry but not argue, dare to be upset but not leave. Next time, everyone is still happy to go, making a scene to get back what they lost.

    不過，有個例外，包家平·李天生·馮景祥·因為是老人，同時亦不失為一顆搖錢樹，當然特別要客氣些。
However, there's an exception. Bao Jiaping, Li Tiansheng, and Feng Jingxiang, because they are older and still serve as cash cows, are naturally treated with special politeness.

    馮最祥·這傢伙，脚色相當厲害，不但踢得一脚好球，而且懂得做「人家」，開了一爿西餐館，憑他三個名字的號召，生意着實不退板，手頭着實有　鈿，可稱為小康之家了。（續完）
Feng Zuixiang, this fellow, is quite capable. Not only is he good at playing football, but he also knows how to be "a person," opening a Western restaurant. With the appeal of his three names, business is definitely steady, and he definitely has money, which can be called a comfortable middle-class life. (To be continued)

Today is "May 1st" International Labor Day, a glorious anniversary of the international workers' struggle for the eight-hour system and demands for victory. Labor circles in various countries are holding grand and enthusiastic celebrations on this day. In this city, before the war, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions would also convene all Shanghai labor circles to hold enthusiastic commemorations. However, this year, due to the extraordinary times and the harsh environment, labor circles throughout the city are unwilling to adopt hypocritical and extravagant ceremonies, but are commemorating this great festival with a firm and calm attitude. Workers in various factories in this city are taking a holiday as usual. Various labor groups have issued a letter to all workers in the city and sent telegrams to labor groups in countries such as England, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, requesting them to jointly resist the aggressors in the Far East, assist China, strive for final victory, and seek the extension of world justice and the sure guarantee of human peace. The letter from various worker groups in this city to the workers and the telegrams to international labor groups are excerpted as follows:

    勗勉工友努力生產
Encouraging Workers to Work Hard and Increase Production

    （一）中國工友欲求自身痛苦之解除、首在力爭民族之獨立自由與平等、因剝削中國工友之利益者、並非國內之資本家、而為當前强暴之侵略者、故我國主權領土、獲得完整獨立後、工友之福利問題、即可迎刃而解（二）在此全面抗戰期間、勞工同胞、應深切瞭解勞資協調之重要、努力增加生產、促進經濟建設、務求物力、財力·之充實與雄　、以為長期抗戰必需之資源
(1) If Chinese workers want to relieve their own suffering, the first step is to strive for national independence, freedom, and equality. The interests of Chinese workers are being exploited not by domestic capitalists but by the current violent aggressors. Therefore, after our country's sovereignty and territory have obtained complete independence, the welfare problems of workers can be easily solved. (2) During this period of full-scale resistance, labor compatriots should deeply understand the importance of labor-management coordination, work hard to increase production, promote economic construction, and strive for the enrichment and strength of material and financial resources as necessary resources for a long-term war of resistance.

    （三）全國勞工同胞、應踴躍參加兵　　或游擊戰爭等、以抵抗强暴之侵略者、為爭取最後勝利而奮鬬、（四）全市勞工同胞、應集中意志與力量、切實奉行國民精神總動員綱領、並一致參加本市國民精神總動員協會之工界組織
(3) Labor compatriots throughout the country should actively participate in military service or guerrilla warfare to resist the violent aggressors and fight for final victory. (4) Labor compatriots throughout the city should concentrate their will and strength, earnestly implement the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, and unanimously participate in the labor organization of the Municipal National Spiritual Mobilization Association.

To the British International Textile Workers' Federation, the French International Workers' Federation, the American Federation of Labor, the American Committee for Industrial Organization, the Dutch International Transport Workers' Federation, and the Dutch International Factory Workers' Federation: Today, all Chinese workers are enthusiastically celebrating International Labor Day in the process of resisting aggression and building the nation. We deeply care about the actual situation of all workers around the world in improving their welfare and treatment. We also deeply feel that if the current violent aggressors in our country are not completely defeated, the working masses of both China and Japan will not have a day to gain freedom and liberation. As the later stage of China's war of resistance unfolds rapidly, and we joyfully celebrate International Labor Day, we, on behalf of one million workers in Shanghai, extend our most sincere and urgent appeal to your federation. We deeply hope that your federation will unite workers around the world to jointly strike a painful blow to the violent aggressors in the Far East, block their economy, and cut off their exchanges. We hereby request that you use all possible manpower, material resources, and financial resources to assist in China's great cause of resisting aggression and building the nation. The day when our country finally wins will be the day when Chinese workers and all Chinese compatriots are liberated, the day when the Japanese working masses and all the Japanese working masses oppressed and trampled on by warlords are liberated, and the day when world justice and human peace are surely guaranteed. We hereby sincerely pray for the best assistance from your federation. Shanghai Federation of Workers' Organizations, Dongyin Seal.

滬定航線恢復　　除裝貨外並載搭客　滬甬復航在請示中　哈納明日駛定海福四日啟椗
Shanghai-Dinghai Route Restored: In addition to loading cargo, passengers are also carried. Resumption of Shanghai-Ningbo Route is Under Request. The Hanna Sets Sail for Dinghai Tomorrow; the Haifu Sets Sail on the Fourth.

    浙東通航口岸、如定海門寧波溫州等處、先後經華方軍事當局封鎖後、滬浙航運、即陷全部斷絕、各方以交通梗阻、影響滋鉅、故經分電請求復航、茲甬定綫首經批准、但因日艦扣留天　輪、致重吿停頓、滬定錢最近亦經允准復航、德商哈納輪、定明日直放定海、至滬甬綫則尙在候核中、各情如次·
After the ports of eastern Zhejiang, such as Dinghai, Ningbo, and Wenzhou, were successively blockaded by the Chinese military authorities, shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang was completely cut off. All parties believed that the traffic obstruction had a significant impact, so they sent separate telegrams requesting the resumption of navigation. Now, the Ningbo-Dinghai route was approved first, but because the Japanese warships detained the Tianlun, it was suspended again. The Shanghai-Dinghai route has also been recently approved for resumption. The German merchant ship Hanna is scheduled to sail directly to Dinghai tomorrow, while the Shanghai-Ningbo route is still awaiting approval. The details are as follows:

    甬定綫復航未成
Ningbo-Dinghai Route Resumption Unsuccessful

    自甬江於上月五日、經寗波防守司令部接奉蔣委員長電令、宣吿封鎖後、所有外輪、均一律禁阻出入、故原有行駛滬甬甬定之各錢輪隻、均吿停航、旋經定海商會等一再請求、始由第　集團軍司令部批准復航、並指定由德商天寳·高登，兩輪行駛、詎天寳輪於上月二十六日首决由甬開定時、竟在螺頭洋面、遭日艦扣留、挾迫駛滬、致該綫復航未成、重吿停頓、
Since the Yong River was announced to be blockaded on the 5th of last month after the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, all foreign ships were prohibited from entering and leaving. Therefore, all Qian ships originally operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo and Ningbo-Dinghai routes were suspended. Subsequently, after repeated requests from the Dinghai Chamber of Commerce, the Headquarters of the 　Army Group approved the resumption of navigation and designated the German merchant ships Tianbao and Gaodeng to operate. Unexpectedly, when the Tianbao ship first decided to sail from Ningbo to Dinghai on the 26th of last month, it was detained by Japanese warships in the Luotouyang waters and forced to sail to Shanghai, causing the route to fail to resume and be suspended again.

    滬定綫明日恢復
Shanghai-Dinghai Route Restored Tomorrow

    關於滬定航錢、經定海商會·定海旅滬同鄉會·及德商遠東公司·先後謂求恢復、以維航運後、業經浙省當局批准、公司方面、已接定分公司電吿如下、（上略）今奉劉總司令轉發政府復商會感電、海福哈納二專輪、准往來直航滬定、（下略）遠東公司接電後、決派哈納輪開航、定明日（即　日）下午四時、直放定海、該輪除裝貨外、並載搭客、票價（統艙）六元、（房艙）十二元、（官艙）十四元、並悉德商禮和洋行之海福輪、亦定本月四日、開定海、
Regarding the Shanghai-Dinghai route, after the Dinghai Chamber of Commerce, the Dinghai Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association, and the German merchant Far East Company successively requested the resumption of navigation to maintain shipping, it was approved by the Zhejiang Provincial authorities. The company has received the following telegram from the branch office: (omitted above) Now, Commander-in-Chief Liu has forwarded the government's telegram to the Chamber of Commerce, approving the Haifu and Hanna two special ships to travel back and forth directly to Shanghai and Dinghai. (omitted below) After receiving the telegram, the Far East Company decided to send the Hanna ship to sail, scheduled to depart directly for Dinghai tomorrow (i.e., the 　day) at 4:00 PM. In addition to loading cargo, the ship will also carry passengers. The ticket price is six yuan (steerage), twelve yuan (cabin), and fourteen yuan (officer's cabin). It is also learned that the Haifu ship of the German merchant Lihe Foreign Company is also scheduled to sail to Dinghai on the fourth of this month.

    滬甬綫在請示中
Shanghai-Ningbo Route is Under Request

    滬甬綫自斷航迄今、為期已將一月、除恩德輪經特准駛甬一决外、其他外輪、均遭禁阻、旅滬甬人、深以交通梗阻為苦、故曾由寗波旅滬同鄕會、及奪波商會、分電顧司令長官。第　集團軍總司令部。寗波防守司令部要求准予通融、的派輪隻、恢復航行、但該項請求、迄今尙未接奉批復、據悉該案業經轉呈最高軍事當局核示
The Shanghai-Ningbo route has been interrupted for a month. Except for the Ende ship, which was specially approved to sail to Ningbo once, other foreign ships have been prohibited. People from Ningbo in Shanghai have suffered greatly from the traffic obstruction. Therefore, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association and the Duobo Chamber of Commerce sent separate telegrams to Commander Gu, the Headquarters of the 　Army Group, and the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters requesting permission to be accommodating and dispatch ships to resume navigation. However, the request has not yet been approved. It is reported that the case has been forwarded to the highest military authorities for review.

    溫州綫尚難復航
Wenzhou Route is Still Difficult to Restore

    浙東之通航口岸、原為海門溫州寗波三處、今因防務關係、暫禁通航、上次由滬駛溫中途折回之各輸、如意商中意公司德平、德商禮和洋行海福、德商遠東公司哈納、除哈納因將復航滬定綫巳卸貨外、其餘各輪、仍未卸貨、希望於短期時復航滬溫綫、但溫州因軍事緊張、暫時恐無恢復航行之希望、至於萬國航務公司之明和輪、本擬由溫裝載海關人員駛滬、今因葡輪關係、深恐為日扣留、故迄未由溫起椗
The navigable ports in eastern Zhejiang were originally Haimen, Wenzhou, and Ningbo. Now, due to defense reasons, navigation is temporarily prohibited. The ships that sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou and turned back halfway, such as Deping of the Italian merchant Zhongyi Company, Haifu of the German merchant Lihe Foreign Company, and Hanna of the German merchant Far East Company, have not yet unloaded their cargo, except for Hanna, which has unloaded its cargo because it is about to resume the Shanghai-Dinghai route. It is hoped that the Shanghai-Wenzhou route will be restored in the short term, but due to military tension in Wenzhou, there is no hope of resuming navigation temporarily. As for the Minghe ship of the International Shipping Company, it was originally intended to load customs personnel in Wenzhou and sail to Shanghai, but due to the relationship of the Portuguese ship, it is feared that it will be detained by Japan, so it has not yet set sail from Wenzhou.

The Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association convened an emergency meeting of all executive and supervisory committee members at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than 20 people, including Yu Qiaqing, Jin Ting, Yu Zuoting, Le Zhenbao, Zhang Jixian, Yuan Ludeng, Qin Runqing, Hong Xianfang, Fang Jiaobo, Shi Zhikun, Zhou Jingzhai, Mu Zixiang, and Chen Yiting, were elected, with Yu Qiaqing as chairman. First, the chairman reported on the tragic bombing, and Chairman Zhou of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce telegraphed, hoping that the fellow townsmen in Shanghai would use their enthusiasm to love and help their hometown, quickly raise funds for emergency relief, so as to save the wounded, comfort the dead, and appease the displaced, so as to stabilize the order in Ningbo. After discussion by the committees, the following important cases were resolved: (1) The association will raise 50,000 yuan in relief funds for emergency relief in Ningbo. Qin Runqing, Yu Zuoting, Le Zhenbao, Mu Zixiang, Zhang Jixian, and others were appointed as fundraising committee members. (2) Ten doctors and 20 nurses will be hired to take medicine and prepare to transport it to Ningbo by boat. (3) The county magistrate will be telegraphed to find out the number of deaths and injuries, and the Central Relief Committee will be telegraphed to allocate funds for relief in accordance with regulations.

Economic Special Edition, Second Symposium Record of This Journal: The Problem of Balancing Prices (Continued) Date: April 16th, 10:00 AM Location: 5th Floor Conference Hall, This Newspaper Written Opinions (In order of receipt)

Zhu Boquan: It is unavoidable that wartime prices are high. All countries experienced this during the European War, so high wartime prices in China are not surprising. Currently, prices of goods vary from place to place within the country, and the reasons for their high prices are not uniform. Taking Shanghai as an example, general prices have risen across the board, especially for essential goods. The main reason seems to be the imbalance of supply and demand. The Shanghai concession is isolated within the occupied area, and the source of goods is blocked. At the same time, factories in the eastern district have been destroyed and looted, and production has ceased, all of which have reduced the supply of goods. On the demand side, the population is dense, and consumption has greatly increased. Demand exceeds supply, and prices are bound to rise. Secondly, the increase in freight and insurance costs and other additional expenses, the decline in exchange rates, and the hoarding by speculators all have a significant impact on rising prices. Among them, the hoarding by speculators is most worthy of our attention. These people are taking advantage of rising prices to manipulate the market and make huge profits. From personal observation, such speculative manipulation is rampant in Shanghai today, and it is necessary to conduct investigations and take preventive measures. The government should adopt policies on prices after examining the conditions in various places and the production and consumption of goods, and implement effective controls. At the same time, it should supplement with sound monetary and financial policies, at least to prevent price increases from exceeding what is reasonable. Special attention should be paid to the regulation of essential goods to avoid affecting social order and hindering the progress of the war.

Recently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs promulgated measures for assessing prices and cracking down on speculation during extraordinary times, and issued circulars to various places to organize price stabilization committees. The measures are very appropriate, and if they can be effectively implemented, they will be effective. However, there are no accurate statistics on prices in various parts of our country, and there is a lack of detailed investigation of local products. There is also a great lack of talent with knowledge of price statistics. It seems appropriate for the government to set up a training class to recruit students and provide them with knowledge of statistical prices in a short period of time, and send them to various places to assist local authorities in handling investigation and statistical matters, so as to facilitate implementation.

How to promote civil autonomous price controls (specifically referring to Shanghai) - The price control measures promulgated by the government are difficult to fully implement in Shanghai at present, and can only be handled automatically by civil autonomous organizations. I believe that on the one hand, a price stabilization committee should be organized by the municipal chamber of commerce and other organizations, bringing together talent with knowledge of price statistics, as well as representatives from various trade associations and other relevant parties, as the central figures of this committee, responsible for overall design and supervision and guidance. At the same time, each trade association should be responsible for organizing price stabilization sub-committees to handle price balance matters related to their respective industries. The first step should be to start with investigations, such as investigating how much inventory of a certain commodity is stored in various warehouses and stores, and how much the Shanghai population consumes of that commodity. Other details such as the source and cost of goods should also be investigated in detail. On the one hand, it is possible to detect whether there is hoarding and speculation, in order to prevent it. At the same time, it is also possible to assess the standard of prices, so that the industry can supervise each other. On the other hand, the financial industry should also pay special attention to commodity mortgages. The banking industry association should stipulate that when the banking industry undertakes commodity mortgages, it should pay attention to whether the commodities are for normal commercial use, or whether they are speculative hoarding. The latter should be refused loans uniformly. Furthermore, a distinction should be made between essential and non-essential goods. The former can be adjusted more, while the latter should be tightened. In addition, for goods lacking in Shanghai that need to be obtained from the interior and are not related to military needs, their import should be encouraged. The above are just a few points from the financial industry. If all parties can work together, price stability will not be difficult.

Price control policies in various countries - European and American countries are all industrial countries, and their production is concentrated in the hands of a few large capitalists. During wartime, various production and transportation industries are managed by the state, and price controls are easier to implement. Our country is an agricultural country, and its political and economic conditions are different from those of European and American countries. Moreover, our country has never had accurate statistics and investigations on prices and production and consumption quantities. Methods that are effective in those countries seem difficult to apply in China.

Yao Qingsan: Currently, domestic prices are much higher than before the war, but the situation varies from place to place. The cost of living index in Shanghai is about 50% higher than before the war, while the rise is even more dramatic in the southwest. As for the reasons, they are extremely complex. Generally speaking, they can be divided into currency-related reasons and non-currency-related reasons. First, regarding currency-related reasons, the most important is the fall in the exchange rate of legal tender, which has caused the prices of foreign goods to increase sharply, and the prices of domestic goods that use foreign goods as raw materials or compete with foreign goods have also increased accordingly. This reason applies to both Shanghai and the southwest. As for currency-related reasons that only apply to the southwest, there are also two points. One is the extraordinary cost of Shanghai remittances. Recently, remittances from the southwest to Shanghai have cost between 100 and 200 yuan. In other words, paying 1,100 to 1,200 yuan in the southwest only yields 1,000 yuan in Shanghai. Goods shipped from Shanghai to the southwest naturally need to increase in price. This is one reason for the drastic price increases in the southwest. The second is the increase in legal tender. Since the outbreak of the war, the government has been cautious about the issuance of legal tender, but in the southwest, there is still a trend of increasing the issuance of legal tender, which is also an undeniable fact. This is also a reason for the relatively drastic price increases in the southwest. Now, let's talk about non-currency-related reasons. First, there is a decrease in supply. Since the outbreak of the war, many important commodity production areas or factories have been occupied, and production decreases are inevitable. In addition, various parties have implemented controls, resulting in a relative decrease in commodity supply, and prices are bound to rise. Second, there is an extraordinary increase in transportation costs. Since the outbreak of the war, transportation has been blocked in various places, making it difficult to communicate. Even if there are transportation routes, transportation costs are bound to be extraordinarily high. Since the cost of goods has increased, prices are bound to rise. Third, since the outbreak of the war, the population of Shanghai and the southwest has increased sharply, which has increased the demand for goods and caused prices to rise. Fourth, currently, merchants face many dangers when transporting goods, so they must raise prices after arriving at their destination to compensate for the risks they have taken. Therefore, a part of the price of goods actually contains the nature of insurance premiums. Fifth, the hoarding and speculation by merchants is naturally an unavoidable phenomenon.

Lin Kanghou: Although price fluctuations are due to many factors, in my opinion, the state of people's minds is also a major factor. It is not scarcity but inequality that is the problem. If things can be distributed equally, prices can be stabilized. For example, with rice, if people believe that there will be a shortage, those with money will store more. As rumors spread, people compete to hoard, and those who hoard rice engage in even more speculation. Therefore, even if there is an official price, there is still an unofficial price. For example, if people believe that the currency is inflating, everyone competes to buy, and prices naturally rise.

To balance prices, we must first stabilize people's minds. Local authorities and community leaders should cooperate in regulating the supply of goods, but news should not be deliberately sensationalized to be exploited by speculators. If this is done, the third and fourth points in the discussion can be resolved, and there will be no unnecessary problems. In short, control is not a bad method, but control that violates natural regulation will result in greater harm than not controlling at all. Therefore, I believe that the government should only adopt policies that remove the causes of price increases or decreases, and play an auxiliary role, while taking autonomous price controls as the main initiative. It is absolutely not appropriate to use rigid methods that will only make the people uneasy. I have other important business and cannot attend the meeting in person. I hope you will understand.

Xie Juxue: (1) Increased currency circulation - Regardless of whether it is convertible or non-convertible, excessive or non-excessive issuance, it is sufficient to promote price increases. For example, during the European War, the paper money issued by the United States had full gold reserves, but prices rose as much as in England and France. This is because more chips are enough to cause the purchasing power of money to fall.

(2) Increased costs - For example, raw materials are provided for military use, and supply is scarce. Or laborers and farmers join the army, and there is a lack of manpower, which are all reasons for increased production costs. Other factors such as difficult transportation, high water freight, increased insurance premiums and taxes, and changes in exchange rates are all reasons for increased transportation costs.

(3) Imbalance of supply and demand - On the supply side, traffic is interrupted, production stops or decreases, or is controlled by the government or occupied by the enemy, resulting in a shortage of inventory. On the demand side, consumer demand and speculative demand come one after another, supply and demand are unbalanced, and prices become even more expensive.

The reasons for high prices in Shanghai are also due to the above reasons. However, if certain major items have never been hoarded, the prices should not be so high. The fact that the major warehouses and godowns in this city are not piled up with goods means that the argument that the supply is scarce cannot be established. The central bank and other institutions are extremely cautious in issuing currency, and legal tender in the occupied area is only being actively contracted, never increased. The fact that the discount on legal tender in this city is often around 50 yuan proves that the amount of currency in circulation is not very loose. The argument of currency inflation cannot be established.

The easiest way to balance prices is for local financiers to cooperate and adopt a serious attitude of vigilance towards commodity mortgages (excluding export goods), especially for general goods that are essential to the lives of civilians. Those who engage in hoarding, except for a few wealthy and powerful individuals, mostly buy large quantities of goods and borrow huge sums of money from the financial industry. The channels for using funds are very narrow, and commodity mortgages are naturally welcome. The situation is the same as with mortgaged real estate before January 28th. As a result, the trend of hoarding goods is encouraged, and the rise in prices cannot be stopped. Now, we believe that the financial industry can agree to increase the discount on mortgaged goods, or use the prices before the war as a benchmark. At the same time, the guild, the reserve, and the discount committee should jointly determine the standard to restrict the industry's "accommodation of officials and restoration of customers." If this is done, those who hoard goods will inevitably be cautious, and prices can tend to balance. We still remember that in the spring of 1937, when prices in the United States soared, the US authorities reduced the mortgaged price of American cotton, and the rising trend was stopped. Looking at the firm and weak market of public bonds in the past, it is determined by the discount of bank mortgages. Therefore, it is not difficult to foresee that this move will have a significant effect. Moreover, this move is not only a moral responsibility that the financial industry should fulfill, but also an essential plan to protect its own business. The current price increase is too large, and the danger is very serious. If there is a misstep, it will inevitably suffer a major loss. The silk mortgage ten years ago and the real estate mortgage before January 28th are all lessons from the past.

Civil autonomous price controls, such as rice, often see public organizations come forward to organize price stabilization committees to find ways to balance prices whenever prices are high, which is quite effective. The fact that the price of rice in Shanghai today is not rising as wildly as other goods should be attributed to this organization. If it can be extended to other goods, it will be of great benefit to the livelihoods of civilians. However, hoarding rice has always been prohibited and is not easy to store for a long time, so balancing is easier. The autonomous control of other commodity prices must be based on the position of the entire industry, benefiting the country and the people. Under the guidance of the trade association, they should actively participate in order to be effective.

Liu Sun: The reasons for high wartime prices: (1) Natural transportation difficulties, and imbalances in supply and demand; (2) Man-made, hoarding and speculation, and manipulating market prices. Now, let's compare the retail prices of rice, coal briquettes, and white cotton cloth in various places, taking December of last year as 100, and compare them with January of this year. The changes are as follows: Medium rice Chongqing fell 10.7, Wanxian rose 35.8, Chengdu rose 9.1, Nanzheng rose 13.8, Guilin fell 17.7, Kunming rose 22.3, Fuzhou fell 9.9, Shanghai fell 2.6: Coal briquettes Chongqing fell 10.0, Wanxian had no increase or decrease, Chengdu fell 33.3, Fuzhou rose 2.1, Shanghai had no increase or decrease, Nanzheng, Guilin, and Kunming had no coal briquettes. Charcoal fell 6.0 in Nanzheng, rose 7.0 in Kunming, but rose as much as 78.7 in Guilin. White cotton cloth Wanxian, Nanzheng, and Fuzhou had no increase or decrease. Kunming, Chongqing, and Chengdu each rose 2.7 to 25.0, but Guilin rose sharply by as much as 75.0. The above is just a brief overview of the general situation of clothing, food, and fuel in various places.

The government should adopt policies on prices

I believe that this issue should be discussed in two parts: (1) Unnecessary items such as luxury goods can be left unrestricted and allowed to rise in price, because these items are only used by a small number of the bourgeoisie and are not related to the national economy and the people's livelihood; however, (2) for the necessities of life that are related to the majority of the people, we must plan well-thought-out policies, such as increasing production, facilitating transportation, and compiling price lists. However, this must be handled by honest civil servants in order to be effective. Otherwise, if handled improperly, it will become government manipulation, and the impact on the people will be even greater than when merchants manipulate it. It is best for the government to strengthen the organization of trade associations and supervise their implementation, which is better than pure government management.

How to promote civil autonomous price controls

I believe that the most important thing is to implement agreements or substitute other items when a certain item rises in price, so that it can be automatically adjusted due to supply and demand.

Introduction to price control policies in various countries During the European War, Russia had organizations such as the "National Food Supply Special Committee," the "Central Flour Administration," the "Central Food Administration," and the "Salt Management Committee." The "National Food Supply Special Committee" also set a "Fixed Price," publishing a list of the prices of several commodities in advance. Later, when the government purchased them, it collected them at the listed price; general transactions also consistently purchased at this price. Another type was the "Regulated Price," which was the selling price forcibly set by local governments. Anyone who did not sell at the "Regulated Price" would be punished by the government. Russia's implementation of these two methods was the initial step in commercial nationalization. In the initial implementation, there were also various difficulties, and it underwent several reforms before it achieved its effect. Other countries also have their own methods of controlling prices, but the situation in our country is different from that in European and American countries, and it seems that we cannot completely imitate the old methods.

Pan Hengqin: (1) Not due to currency inflation (for reasons, please see page 3 of the 47th issue of the Banking Weekly) (2) Due to the huge military needs during the war, the demand for necessities has increased (3) Unscrupulous merchants hoard and speculate to monopolize the market (4) Cultivated land is regarded as a war zone, and factories are destroyed by the enemy, so production cannot proceed (5) Insurance premiums are increased, interest rates are raised, and production costs are increased (6) The Japanese impose heavy taxes, which increase costs (7) Transportation is interrupted and transportation is inconvenient (8) Due to the black market for foreign exchange, the prices of imported goods have risen, which in turn has led to the rise in the prices of domestic goods (9) Consumption has increased, and the population of Shanghai has increased sharply from 3 million to 5 million (according to recent newspaper statistics on the population) (10) The financial industry is competing to make commodity mortgages

The government should adopt policies on prices

(1) A price control committee should be established to coordinate all plans (2) Officially set prices (3) Fixed quota allocation (4) Control consumption (5) Facilitate transportation Please see page 10 of the 12th issue of Selected Economic Essays from China and Foreign Countries (6) In principle, it is best to abolish the black market for foreign exchange, but it is not easy to do so. The authorities should provide as much foreign exchange as possible for the import of necessities, so the current technology for approving foreign exchange should be reformed so that the import of genuine necessities can obtain foreign exchange.

How to promote civil autonomous price controls

(1) Widely publicize the importance of price controls, which is the responsibility of the publishing industry (2) Use commercial organizations such as trade associations as the main force for civil price controls. If trade associations can be responsible for handling it, the effect will be significant. (3) Trade associations should crack down on merchants who hoard and speculate (4) Thrift campaigns are the best way to promote civil autonomous price controls (5) The government should work with banks to adjust prices with financial power, such as the government stipulating the highest interest rate for tea mortgages.

Symposium Record Two

Zhang Yifan: Summarizing the reasons given by the gentlemen for soaring prices and the different degrees of price increases for various goods: we can reach a conclusion:

(1) The main reason for the current price increase is not so much due to currency factors as it is due to the imbalance of supply and demand. The relationship between the fall in exchange rates and the direct rise in prices should have stopped long ago. But in fact, there is still a continuing upward trend. It can be seen that in addition to exchange rates, there are other reasons, and that reason is that the supply and demand relationship has not improved.

(2) The main reasons for the imbalance of supply and demand: lie in the fact that most of China's industrial areas have been lost, and production has naturally been greatly affected. The war zone is vast, and the freight relations within the war zone are subject to various obstacles from the Japanese and puppets, as well as harsh levies and taxes. Between the war zone and the non-war zone, in addition to the obstacles to freight from the Japanese and puppets, there are also controls on import and export transit trade by the central government, and controls on domestic and foreign exchange, all of which make the free flow of goods intermittent. The high cost of freight, insurance, and exchange rates means that if prices in the consumer area do not rise sharply, producers will not be willing to go there. Therefore, as long as goods are in circulation, they take as a prerequisite that the price in the consumer area is more expensive than the price in the production area, to the extent that they can make a fortune from the national crisis. This creates price differences in space. In addition to the objective conditions of the environment, this difference obviously contains the moral conditions of speculation and manipulation of hoarding and high prices.

(3) The prices of handicrafts and mineral products have risen the most, the prices of agricultural raw materials have risen less, and the prices of agricultural products in rural areas have even fallen generally, while the prices of goods in urban areas have risen generally. The prices of imported goods have risen uniformly, and the prices of local products have risen and fallen to varying degrees. This is all due to the relationship between currency and supply and demand and the situation formed by their weaving. However, the impact of currency is limited to the black market impact of exchange rates, rather than the increase in the number of currency in circulation. Imported goods are affected by the rise in exchange rates, and the rise in the prices of imported goods also affects the prices of some local products and causes them to rise. The prices of local products that are not related to imported goods vary greatly in space due to changes in freight relations and supply and demand. This difference in space can also affect each other and move towards a consistent rising process. For example, Shanghai, the cotton yarn producing area, has risen due to a decrease in production: but because the interior needs are urgent, it is sold at a high price. Merchants sell it to the interior, adding transportation costs and other costs, and normal profits, and also use the degree of local needs to add illegitimate profits, which is the speculative price benefit. Therefore, the selling price in the interior is even more expensive, and this more expensive price affects Shanghai, the producing area, and Shanghai yarn merchants use this as a standard for high prices. In this way, mutually causing and effecting, prices continue to soar until natural savings occur.

(4) But the savings of necessities of life have a certain limit. Therefore, the price increase of such goods is not easy to stop. If a halt occurs, the oppression suffered by the national life can be said to have reached the highest degree. Whether from the producer's point of view or from the consumer's point of view: it is unfavorable. The consumer's disadvantage is the most obvious. The producer's disadvantage to high prices is not understood by the general public. Therefore, high-price periods are often regarded as boom periods. But the reason for the current high prices is due to the increase in secondary costs, and these costs occur in the circulation process, such as freight, insurance, and exchange rates, with the harsh levies and taxes of the Japanese and puppets being the greatest. This kind of exorbitant tax is regarded as one of the costs by merchants, but it is obtained without labor by the Japanese and puppets. If the price increase in Shanghai has a certain degree, then this unearned extortion will also have to have a certain limit. But Shanghai is a free market, and prices can soar arbitrarily, so this unearned extortion can also be demanded arbitrarily. Therefore, to maintain the free market of Shanghai prices, the profitable producers can rather be said to be the Japanese and puppets and foreign merchants. And the production costs of foreign merchants are fundamentally expensive, and the impact of exchange rates is deep, so the possibility of profit is far less than that of Japanese merchants. What's more, the markets in the war zone are all controlled by the Japanese army, and there is no freedom to enter and exit. Therefore, no matter from the producer's point of view, the consumer's point of view, or even the foreign merchant's point of view, they should all take a long-term view and jointly balance the current rising prices to a reasonable standard.

Shen Zhenyi: To stabilize prices, in my opinion, we must first distinguish the types of goods and make the following three observations: (1) export commodities, (2) luxury goods, (3) daily necessities. Regarding the first item, because the price increase is beneficial, there is no need to stabilize it. The second item is only for the enjoyment of a few people and has little to do with the general public, so it can be allowed to rise naturally. Only the third item, daily necessities, in the current situation, it is really necessary to find ways to stabilize it. Indeed, in the current special environment, any good method is not easy to obtain satisfactory results. However, if we can do our best and do what we can, and if the trade associations come out to maintain it with the greatest strength, it is not impossible to do so. For example, the price of rice, in today's soaring prices, can still stand at the limit price of 14 yuan, which is lower than the general price increase after the war. This cannot but be attributed to the rice industry association. Furthermore, the degree of increase in silk fabrics after the war is not as high as that of raw silk. According to the recent price of silk, it has risen by 161% compared to before the war, while silk fabrics have only risen by 47% to 26%. Although there is no doubt that the cost has been reduced due to the interweaving of raw silk and rayon, it is said that the trade association has also discussed and formulated regulations to stabilize prices, and does not want to rise and fall as wildly as the price of silk. As for the soaring prices of vegetable oil and soybean oil today, although they are due to another special problem, it seems difficult to stabilize them for a while, but if the industry proceeds in a positive direction, it may not be possible to find ways to remedy them. Judging from the increase in soybeans and soybean oil, the recent price of oil has risen by 71% compared to two months ago, while the price of soybeans in the same period has risen by 15%, which is a huge difference. At this time when the price of oil is high and the raw materials are very high, the oil workshops in the rural areas that use local methods to extract oil will definitely be happy to increase production because of the high profits. If the source can be unblocked, the current price of oil can also be stabilized. On the one hand, more small-scale oil mills can be set up in this city to purchase soybeans from the interior to make oil, which is a fundamental plan. In view of this, if the trade associations follow the spirit of civil autonomous price stabilization and engage in unblocking sources, increasing production, or using other substitutes to suppress the soaring prices of certain goods due to shortages, then even in extremely difficult circumstances, at least the effect of stabilizing a part of the prices can be achieved. I hope to give strength to the discussion community and enlighten everything. I think all industries will not let the rice and silk industries monopolize the beauty of the past. (To be continued) Mailbox What if war breaks out in Europe

Letter from Mr. Ni Yafei (omitted above) The European situation is becoming increasingly serious, and war seems inevitable: Although our country is located in East Asia, the world situation is closely related; when a vortex arises, it is not without impact. Here are a few questions for your enlightenment:

(A) If war breaks out in Europe, then

(1) What impact will it have on China's national economy during the Anti-Japanese War?

(2) Will China's foreign exchange reserves suffer any disadvantages?

(3) Will there be any changes in the relationship between China's legal tender and the shilling?

(4) Will foreign capital come to our country to avoid war?

(5) Will the value of foreign currency in our country's market depreciate or vice versa?

(6) Will China's foreign trade and import industries be completely paralyzed? Especially the import of our military needs?

(B) Will the general cost of living index in Shanghai increase even more? Or will it fall rapidly?

The reporter replies As of now: The nature of the future European war has not yet been determined: Is it an imperialist war? Or an anti-aggression war? This will be determined by whether the Soviet Union and the United States participate. These two different natures will also have different impacts on China's economy and the entire world economy. Politics and economy are interconnected, so are they in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. Therefore, the above questions must also be dealt with separately according to the nature of the war. And we must pay attention to the comparison with the Japanese economy.

If the war is for the purpose of anti-aggression with the participation of the Soviet Union and the United States, then the environment in which our country finds itself may have three different changes: One is that due to pressure from other parties on the Japanese side, we will launch a general counter-offensive, and an opportunity for an absolute and advantageous general counter-offensive. Therefore, the driving force for wartime economic construction will rapidly expand from the interior to the areas that have been overcome. This improvement in the military situation makes it very possible for foreign capital to come to China to avoid war. Unless the warring countries immediately and strictly manage their capital markets to make this impossible. But at that time, it will inevitably enter the stage of genuine money (including financial aid and investment) and effort (including joining the army and labor service) due to the upswing of the national spirit. The development of the national economy will be far more rapid and reasonable than during the previous European war. The second is the possibility that the Japanese side will sell out its allies and use the resources in the Chinese war zone as bait to lure the British and Americans. Whether the British and Americans are willing to be deceived will be determined by the results of the Soviet Union's operations in Europe. However, China will definitely not be willing to be sold out by the British and Americans, so it will continue to resist Japan. For the sake of the future fate of British and American rights and interests in China, even if they compromise with Japan, they will not change the feelings and assistance to China's war of resistance against Japan. Therefore, China's situation may be even more difficult than it is today, but all the economic conditions required for the war will not be interrupted. If the British and Americans are deceived by the Japanese side, and our country is deceived by the British and Americans, then economic activities within China will inevitably accelerate under the control of the Japanese side. As a result, the colonial economic process will be completed. Not only will there be no welfare and effects of the national economy, but the wealth and sweat of the entire Chinese people will be squeezed dry. But this possibility is extremely weak, at least it will not easily happen until the end of the European war. Third: Japan may intensify its military operations against China. In addition to relying on the geographical situation to hold on, China will also expand guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas. This situation may occur immediately before or after the outbreak of the European war, or it may occur after a considerable period of time, or it may continue and unfold a long-term war, or it may unfold intermittently. Japan must mainly focus on a quick victory, and if it fails, it may turn to a war of attrition in order to carry out its leisure to alienate the anti-aggression front. Whether our country will still adopt a war of attrition is not necessarily certain. But if the anti-aggression front adheres to its faith, then the Japanese side's military operations will inevitably promote its early collapse. However, the fate of the Chinese economy is more difficult to judge. However, Japan's planned exploitation of the economy in the war zone will still be nothing more than intensifying its plunder, but its financial difficulties and its domestic currency crisis will be more severe than they are today. Because his financial groups will not dare to risk investing in China, and the development of his inflation will inevitably unfold more badly, and the result will only accelerate the collapse of his national strength.

As for our country's foreign exchange reserves, what is the point of being unfavorable at that time? It is the same now. Because there is no need for our country to recover them at all, and they are not deposited in one country. And its contribution to the Anti-Japanese War is not so much in protecting the legal tender as it is in emphasizing financial credit abroad. In addition to the physical basis, the credit of a country's finances also has a political basis. Referring to the previous section, it can be known that there is no problem.

At the beginning of the war, if the British government does not take emergency measures, the pound will inevitably fluctuate temporarily. But according to the experience of 1914, it can generally maintain its stability. Today, the British pound's defense mechanism is extremely complete, and the technology of modern exchange control is much more perfect than before. In fact, if the United States immediately participates in the war, then the international financial market will not be swept up by the war. As for the status of our country's legal tender, in fact, everything has long been manipulated by its political status. So the problem is not the outbreak of the European war, but what kind of environment our country will be in after the outbreak of the European war? This can be reviewed with the above three changes. And there is more possibility of being firm due to the upswing of the national spirit. For example, the recent sharp rise in the value of legal tender in North China and the sharp drop in Japanese puppet vouchers have been affected by the new diplomatic posture between the United States and Japan and the fact that the Soviet-British negotiations have raised the issue of Japan.

The fourth item of question A has been explained in the previous section. The fifth item is fundamentally unfounded. Because no country has any need to adopt a policy of depreciating its currency during wartime. As for the changes in its market price, it can also be inferred from the explanation in the previous section.

No country today can be said to have completely self-sufficient conditions, and the United States and the Soviet Union are not omnipotent either: not to mention the others. Therefore, if they do not have exports, they are not worried about not being able to import: Therefore, as long as our country continues to export, it is not worried about not being able to import. If the first possibility mentioned above becomes a reality, then our country's exports will definitely increase more than they do today, so there is a possibility of increasing imports. Since China is an anti-aggression war country, it is not worried about the supply and assistance of military supplies to us by friendly countries. Moreover, the necessary degree of military supplies imports: also depends on the storage capacity: the development of the war situation and the acquisition of war trophies; the relationship with the other party and other situations. Therefore, although we cannot speculate recklessly, we do not have to worry unnecessarily.

If the Soviet Union and the United States remain neutral and still launch a war to seize colonies for imperialism, then our country's economic environment at that time will not change much from today. As for question B, it also varies with changes in the political environment. But one thing that can be predicted is that the population will inevitably decrease compared to today. Therefore, if there is no bad destruction in terms of currency and the current situation can be maintained, then although imports may be slightly reduced, the price aspect will not change much. Commercial News Finance Cash is not being made The price of British Indian silver is falling

Last week, because the Chinese army won victories in various battlefields and the good news spread throughout the country, the people were increasingly unwilling to accept the paper money of the puppet "Joint Reserve Bank" of Tianjin. When the black market opened on Monday last week, compared with Saturday of the previous week, it was reduced by 4 yuan 2 jiao and 5 fen per hundred yuan. 100 yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for 121 yuan 5 jiao of "counterfeit money."

### MIN AND GUANGDONG SEAS: JAPANESE WARSHIPS REPEATEDLY INTERCEPT FOREIGN VESSELS

THE "WEST SIGHS" CARGO IS NOW IN TAIWAN; THE "NEW HAIMEN" IS FORTUNATE TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM BRITISH WARSHIPS

Shantou Correspondence, April 8th: The British company Jardine Matheson's vessel "West Sighs" was loading salt in Dongshan Quan Bay on the Fujian border when it was seized by a Japanese warship and taken to Penghu. Many salt-carrying wooden boats were also burned. Passengers and crew members from the "West Sighs" were taken to Taiwan. Upon hearing the news, a British warship rushed to negotiate, but without success. Since then, all those taking foreign vessels have been very cautious. More than 120 passengers on the "West Sighs" were severely mistreated and interrogated in Taipei. It was not until the 24th that they were escorted back to Hong Kong on the "Guangdong Maru". It is said that some people, identified as artillerymen, were not released. The cargo of the "West Sighs" was seized in Taiwan and is about to become a pending case. Furthermore, on the 22nd, the British vessel "New Haimen" and the Norwegian merchant vessel "Gungsholm" were also intercepted by Japanese warships en route. The "Gungsholm", carrying tens of thousands of dan of beans, paper, and bamboo shoots from Fuzhou, encountered three Japanese warships suddenly in the White Dog Sea area on its way to Shantou. It was ordered to stop, and then Japanese soldiers were sent from the Japanese warships to thoroughly inspect the cargo manifest. After reviewing it, the ship was immediately seized and taken to Taiwan. The "New Haimen", sailing from Fuzhou to Shantou, saw the "Gungsholm" being seized by the Japanese warship and immediately telegraphed for assistance. A small British warship near Quanzhou heard the news and rushed to the Shitou Dog Sea area. However, because of its small size, it appeared insignificant compared to the Japanese warships. Fearing a collision, armed sailors were sent to move the large and small cannons and anti-aircraft guns onto the "New Haimen" for armed self-defense. The three Japanese warships formed a triangular formation, aiming their cannons at the "New Haimen", firmly refusing to let it pass. They also sent airplanes to circle above the British vessel. The ship's anti-aircraft guns were aimed at the Japanese planes, preventing them from flying too low. Just as the situation was extremely tense, a large British warship arrived. Before it arrived, a squadron of fighter planes flew in to protect it. Seeing the situation was not favorable, the Japanese warships immediately retreated. The "New Haimen" has been operating between Shantou, Hong Kong, and Fuzhou for more than ten years and is in the same company as the "West Sighs". The Japanese navy's desire to monopolize coastal and river shipping rights is becoming increasingly apparent.

### NATIONAL CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITIES DECIDE ON WARTIME EDUCATION POLICIES

Education Conference Proposals Include Three Key Points: Uphold Educational Freedom, Build China

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The National Christian University Education Conference, which began on April 17th in Hong Kong and lasted for six days, has been reported in this newspaper. According to Miao Qiusheng, a pastor who attended the conference, the National Christian University Education Conference was originally held annually. After the conference in February 1937, this is the first conference held after the outbreak of the War of Resistance. The first expression of this conference is the spirit of unity, and the second is to exchange experiences gained during the War of Resistance and views on current issues. The thirteen Christian universities currently have 6,000 students, accounting for one-tenth of the number of students in public and private universities nationwide. The reason why universities have been able to maintain themselves after the outbreak of the war is entirely due to the deep understanding of righteousness, salary cuts, and hard work of the faculty and staff, as well as the huge special subsidies granted by friendly countries (about one million yuan last year). This conference lasted for six days and passed 33 proposals, all of which were adapted to the wartime Christian education policy during the national crisis.

Educational Policy During the National Crisis

The resolutions passed at this conference can be summarized into three key points: A. (1) Cultivate Christian character, (2) Education must be free, (3) Be loyal to the country. We would rather make the greatest sacrifices. These three principles are extremely important. The reason why universities have repeatedly moved is purely because education cannot be carried out in accordance with these principles. This is the first key point of the resolutions of this conference. B. Implement Christian higher education and build a new China. We should be prepared in advance for the important mission we bear to the country and the nation during and after the War of Resistance. Therefore, we hope that universities that cannot implement the above principles and have to move elsewhere should study the overall issues of the location in order to make a contribution to the local area, the country, and the people. We must not be perfunctory and live in peace, harbor the mentality of fleeing from disaster, and even more so, we should not hope to move back to the original school in the future. This is the second key point of the resolutions of this conference. C. Establish a Rural Construction Committee to concentrate the strength of various universities, implement concerted cooperation, and build rural China. In the past, the contributions of various universities to rural areas were inconsistent and the strength was dispersed. Each school spent one million yuan on agricultural science each year. In the future, in order to promote agricultural affairs, increase production, and build rural areas, it is impossible to succeed without a unified organization to coordinate all plans. Therefore, this association was formed. This is the third key point of the resolutions of this conference.

Overcoming Difficulties and Devoting Oneself to Education

Shi Long said that Christian undertakings in our country are divided into three categories: one is evangelism, the second is medicine, and the third is education. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance in our country, the first two tasks continued to be carried out within the possible scope in the occupied areas, adapting to the needs of the times and engaging in relief work with the greatest effort. As for education, there are only two options: one is to suspend operations, and the other is to continue operations. I have already mentioned that if education can be free and the lives of faculty, staff, and students can be guaranteed, no matter how difficult or how great the sacrifices, it will continue to be carried out. Before the War of Resistance, under this principle, eleven of the thirteen Christian universities continued to operate. For example, Huazhong University first moved from Wuchang to Guilin, then to Dali in Yunnan, and finally to western Sichuan. Soochow University was originally in Suzhou, then moved to Huzhou, then to Hangxi in Anhui, and finally to the Shanghai Concession, so the losses were heavy, but it is still proceeding in difficulties.

The school is actively carrying out the "implementation of the tutor system," "implementation of military management," and "improvement of academic research" for school socialization.

### FABER CUP MINIATURE FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT OPENS; EVERLAST LOSES TO LIDO

Four to Two; Li Yichen Scores Three Goals; Wenying Defeats French Army Three to Zero

The Donghua Sports Association's Faber Cup miniature football league opened yesterday afternoon at the Sino-French College of Technology stadium on Avenue Albert. There were two demonstration matches. The official league will begin on Wednesday. In yesterday's first match between the French Army and Wenying, the playing was disorganized and unexciting. Wenying's Tao Ziming performed very well. Deng Zhiyang won with a shot. In the first half, Tao Tingfu kicked a ball into the net from the penalty spot, and Deng Zhiyang followed up with a shot to score. Wenying won 3-0.

Wenying: Tao Ziming, Wang Guowei, Shen Jinyuan, Zhang Yinhai, Zhao Yongfang, Deng Zhiyang, Tao Tingfu.

Lido Defeats Everlast

Everlast is the incarnation of Donghua, so the situation immediately became tense after Lido and Everlast entered the arena. Faber kicked off, and after two minutes of fierce fighting, Lido's Zhang Mingsheng launched the first attack, but the shot went out of bounds. Lido's three forwards were closely watched by Everlast and did nothing. Everlast also launched surprising attacks many times, but to no avail due to the iron legs and Meng Yang sitting in the town. The stalemate lasted until 20 minutes, when Zhang Mingsheng made a comeback. Qin Bigao rushed out to save, but Li Yichen waved his strange leg and cleverly hit the upper corner. Lido took the lead 1-0. Three minutes later, Yichen got the ball and charged in alone. Cai Shengmiao, Zhuang Youren, and Shu Shigeng were unable to stop him, and Li swept the ball into the net, making it 2-0. The first half ended, with Everlast trailing by two goals. After the intermission, Everlast's three forwards were all transferred, and the situation changed dramatically. After fifteen minutes, Yichen shot angrily at the twelve-yard spot, and Qin Bigao could not save it. Lido went up another level. Not long after, Zhang Mingsheng passed the ball low from the periphery towards the goal, Qin Bigao rushed out, and it actually leaked into the net, making the score 4-0. Everlast counterattacked, and Wu Binghao scored two goals in five minutes. Suddenly, the whistle sounded long, and Lido won 4-2.
