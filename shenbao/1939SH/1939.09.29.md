### Moscow Evidently the Center of the Situation - Britain Plans to Send Senior Officials to Appease - Complex German-Soviet Negotiations Difficult to Reach Agreement - Estonian Foreign Minister Flies to Soviet Capital Again

London - According to news from here today, Britain is still trying to win over the Soviet Union. Last night, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, met with the British Foreign Secretary Halifax to answer various questions raised by the British side on Saturday. It is said that former Prime Minister Lloyd George will be sent to Moscow as a special envoy of Britain, and the Minister of Commerce, Stanley, will also accompany him. According to the Soviet side here, the Soviet Union is ready to start commercial negotiations with Britain. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

London - The British government yesterday proposed to the Soviet Union to restart talks on commercial and economic issues between the two countries. According to well-informed sources here, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, gave a positive answer to Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon, but said that the British government must be prepared to provide commercial credit loans to the Soviet Union and allow the Soviet Union to export a large number of goods to Britain. Diplomatic circles here believe that the Soviet government's attitude is due to the fact that the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is in Moscow talking with the Soviet authorities. It is said that Ribbentrop wants to alienate Turkey from Britain and France on the one hand, and proposes to the Soviet Union to jointly adopt a "peace offensive" on the other hand, so that on the day peace is realized, all European political issues and all "intolerable" territorial issues will be thoroughly reviewed. If the Western European democracies refuse peace, they will instigate the Soviet Union to cooperate with Germany, and reward the Soviet Union for its demands on Bessarabia province of Romania. At the same time, the Baltic Sea coastal countries will be divided into the spheres of influence of Germany and the Soviet Union. Because of Ribbentrop's activities, the Soviet Union has attached various conditions to the issue of British-Soviet economic talks. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Tokyo - According to today's Japan Times, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, assured the British Foreign Secretary Halifax on Tuesday that the Soviet Union's relationship with Germany is limited to a non-aggression treaty, and that it would not want to go beyond this. He also said that the Soviet Union will continue to maintain a neutral attitude towards the British-German war. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

London - According to reliable sources in Berlin, the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's decision to go to Moscow is to conclude an agreement with the Soviet authorities to jointly maintain the new situation in Poland by force when necessary. At the same time, the issues of the Baltic Sea coastal countries and the Balkan Peninsula will be submitted for discussion, but Germany has no intention of supporting the Soviet Union's various demands on Estonia. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

London - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will continue negotiations on the situation of various countries in the world this afternoon. Because the content of the talks has not yet been released, speculation has arisen. Paris officials believe that the Soviet Union is now demanding significant sacrifices from the German side in the Baltic Sea area as the price for the Soviet Union to continue to maintain neutrality. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Moscow - According to well-informed sources here, the itinerary of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's decision to visit Moscow, although not yet fully arranged, is believed to be longer than his first visit because the issues being discussed are more complicated than before and cannot be resolved in a day or two. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin, German Ambassador Schulenburg, and Italian Ambassador Rosso welcomed him at the airport. The flags of Germany and the Soviet Union were hung everywhere in the airport. A Red Army team also saluted Foreign Minister Ribbentrop with guns. Ribbentrop then went to the Kremlin Palace with Ambassador Schulenburg at 10:00 PM to visit People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov and held talks with each other. It is said that Ribbentrop's entourage consisted of 38 people, including many economic, military, and diplomatic experts. The "Mayor of Danzig Free City" Forster was also among them. The entourage arrived in two planes this afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Moscow - Estonian Foreign Minister Selter arrived here at 6:00 PM this afternoon on a Swedish national airline mail plane, just a few minutes after German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived here. Accompanying Foreign Minister Selter were the Estonian Envoy to the Soviet Union, Leo August, Speaker of the House of Representatives Ulots, Professor Peepus, an expert in international law, and the Soviet Envoy to Estonia, Nikitin. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

### Baltic Sea Problem - Estonia's Situation Increasingly Difficult - Soviet Aircraft Discovered Over Estonia Again - Soviet Ship Sunk by Submarine

Estonian Capital - Authoritative sources here claim that multiple Soviet aircraft flew over Estonia again yesterday. According to reports, when Soviet aircraft first entered Estonian territory on the 26th, the Estonian government protested to the Soviet Union. It is said that Soviet aircraft were found near the Estonian capital and Arensborg on Ösel Island. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

Moscow - The Soviet ship "Metallist," with a displacement of approximately 4,000 tons, was sunk by a submarine of unknown nationality in Narva Bay at around 6:00 PM today. Of the 24 crew members, 19 were rescued by Soviet patrol boats, and the whereabouts of the remaining five are unknown. (TASS dispatch, 27th)

Moscow - The Soviet Union has taken an unusually serious attitude towards the incident. Political figures here believe that the incident will inevitably affect the negotiations between Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov and Estonian Foreign Minister Selter. It is generally believed here that the Soviet government will demand certain military rights in Estonian ports. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

Latvian Capital - It is heard that the Soviet Union has demanded from Estonia that Dago Island and Ösel Island become Soviet naval bases. Dago Island is the largest of the Estonian-owned islands near the Gulf of Finland, separated from Ösel Island by a strait. It was owned by Germany during the war. The Soviet Union is not satisfied with the Estonian government's explanation regarding the escape of Polish submarines from Tallinn Port, hence this demand. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Finnish Capital - According to French newspapers, the Soviet Union will raise the issue of the Åland Islands again. The Finnish Foreign Minister has absolutely denied this information. He solemnly stated that the Finnish capital has not received any information regarding this intention. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)

Finnish Capital - According to reliable sources here today, if the Soviet Union can occupy the militarily important Estonian islands, it will at least be temporarily satisfied. However, the current Estonian government is not regarded as very friendly by the Soviet Union. Therefore, in order to improve relations between the two countries, it is also possible that the Soviet Union will demand the reorganization of the Estonian government. Currently, Estonian newspapers and radio stations are all silent on the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union has begun its counter-propaganda, and the Soviet Navy is patrolling along the coast of Estonia in teams. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Estonian Capital - The Soviet semi-official side issued a message on the 25th of this month stating that a Polish submarine detained in Tallinn Port had escaped after being repaired and refueled.

The semi-official news agency Eda has been ordered to issue a message to firmly deny this. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Estonian Capital - The newspapers here today published articles emphasizing the simultaneous visits of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Estonian Foreign Minister Selter to Moscow. The semi-official "Esti" newspaper strongly stated that after Poland disappeared from the map of Europe, the balance of power in the Baltic Sea will inevitably be affected. Britain and France have become out of reach, and the situation in the future will inevitably be dominated by the two powers of Germany and Russia. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

German-Soviet and Baltic and Balkan Peninsula Countries Situation Map

### Balkan Peninsula Problem - Germany Plans to Induce Turkey to Remain Neutral - Soviet Troops Arrive at the Hungarian Border - Yugoslavia Negotiates with the Soviet Union

London - The morning newspapers here are all commenting extensively on the "Moscow Mystery." The diplomatic affairs reporter of The Times stated, "The German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's return to Moscow while Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu is visiting the Soviet Union shows that the purpose of this trip is not limited to establishing a buffer state in Poland. He may demand that the Soviet Union induce Turkey to distance itself from Western European countries. However, it is not known whether the Soviet Union can do so, and it is not necessarily certain that Turkey will listen." The Times also published a telegram from its Moscow correspondent stating, "Diplomatic circles here are quite surprised by the coincidence of the German and Turkish Foreign Ministers visiting the Soviet Union. Although Turkish officials here say that the two are not related, they also admit that Foreign Minister Saracoğlu's stay here will be extended due to the arrival of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. It is heard that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop wants the Soviet Union to advise Turkey to remain neutral so that Italy can help Germany in the war. As for the Soviet Union's wishes for the Baltic Sea coastal countries and the attitude that Germany will take, it is unknown, but the Soviet authorities may put a fait accompli before Foreign Minister Ribbentrop." (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Berlin - The Turkish Ambassador to Germany presented his credentials to Prime Minister Hitler yesterday. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Moscow - The Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Aktai, hosted a luncheon yesterday for the Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu. Soviet dignitaries Molotov, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Potemkin, Tikanov, Lozovsky, Talentyev, and all the staff of the Turkish Embassy were invited to accompany him. During the luncheon, Saracoğlu and Molotov exchanged congratulatory remarks. (TASS dispatch, 28th)

Romanian Capital - Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu is conducting talks with the Soviet authorities in Moscow. According to well-informed sources here, Saracoğlu intends to propose a plan to the Soviet Union, advocating the formation of an expanded Balkan consultation group to form a truly neutral group of countries, and has notified the Romanian government of its contents. According to this plan, Romania may have to make some territorial sacrifices, and must obtain the unanimous consent of all parties in the country. Therefore, there are reports that the authorities intend to recruit various opposition parties, including the National Peasants' Party, to form a government of national unity. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Hungarian Capital - It is heard that Soviet troops, after arriving at the border between Poland and Hungary, contacted the Hungarian border guards today. Soviet officers asked Hungarian officers to indicate the boundary line to avoid disputes. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Yugoslav Capital - It is rumored that the German government sent an aide-mémoire to Yugoslavia, the content of which was to put forward various demands in the economic area. Informed sources here have firmly denied this, stating that German and Yugoslav representatives are scheduled to negotiate here on the 28th of this month in order to resolve various economic issues between the two sides. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Berlin - According to the Berlin correspondent of the "Hamburg Foreign News," which has close ties with the German Foreign Ministry, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's decision to visit Moscow will increase the anger and anxiety of the enemy countries, because they do not want to see Germany and the Soviet Union achieve friction-free cooperation. The German-Soviet agreement is in response to the needs of the international situation, and therefore has a very solid foundation. The purpose of Ribbentrop's visit to Moscow is to discuss the various political issues arising after the annexation of Poland. Seeing that Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu is also in the Russian capital, it can be seen that Turkish foreign policy has been affected after the German-Soviet rapprochement. The eventual result will be that Germany will have greater freedom of action, and British interests will be completely expelled from the Balkan Peninsula. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

Editorial

### The War in Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces

Global attention is focused on the confusing and ever-changing international situation, which has now lasted for over a month. Even in China, where we are engaged in a war of resistance with pain and suffering close to our hearts, people inevitably cast their gaze towards the international arena. Isn't this a sign that peace is indivisible and that the world's affairs are unstable and losing their center of gravity?

In our opinion, the seeds of aggression were sown long ago. Because certain nations, who seemed to bear the heavy responsibility of influencing global changes, lacked the resolve and were content with temporary ease and security, they allowed the flames of aggression to spread and become the norm. Like nurturing a boil, we reap the consequences today. Czechoslovakia was sacrificed at the negotiating table and written off lightly. Wasn't this a masterpiece of peace, seemingly indicating that there were ways to eliminate disaster? But in the end, weapons were drawn, and even though millions of lives were used to protect Poland, it did nothing to avert Poland's disintegration. As events unfold now, the situation is worsening. We ask, what will become of Estonia's fate tomorrow, and who will control it? What will become of Romania's fate the day after tomorrow, and who will control it? What will become of the fate of the other small countries in Northern Europe, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Southeastern Europe, and who will control it? Violence reigns supreme, order is shattered, and the countries of Europe can only pray for divine protection, hoping that those who seize power will show mercy. Is there really any way for them to survive on their own? Looking back eight or nine years ago, Geneva was filled with dignitaries, all gathered to discuss world affairs, dismissing the sparks of the Mukden Incident as nothing. Now, they only see iron and blood as the highest authority. The clash of iron and blood will determine fate through victory and defeat. The unknowable fork in the road ahead lies in whether each individual destiny will await a final resolution through the iron-blooded contest of the entire world, or whether each contest will determine the outcome, leading to peace for the entire world. According to the former perspective, we await the expansion of the war, which is what Czechoslovakia and Poland must hope for. According to the latter perspective, we should each struggle in our own local wars. As for the Sino-Japanese War, if the European war expands into a world war, then China and Japan cannot remain outside the overall resolution, as the overall situation and trend are irresistible. Otherwise, the center of gravity in the Far East remains tied to China and Japan. Those who allow their thoughts to wander far afield are mistaken.

The Sino-Japanese War has now lasted for twenty-seven months, with countless battles large and small. There have been no major battles in the recent three to five months, but in the past week, the situation has suddenly become active. The Japanese army has launched a major offensive in Hunan, clearly aiming for Changsha. The Chinese army has counterattacked in Jiangxi, both to relieve the threat to Hunan's flank and to shake the Japanese army's westward advance. According to war reports, the Japanese army in Hunan has made slight progress, while the Chinese army in Jiangxi has retaken many strategically important points in a matter of days, reportedly annihilating a large number of Japanese troops. It is a well-known fact that the Sino-Japanese War does not place importance on gains and losses of land, even of small territories. However, what both sides are demonstrating today, besides military significance, should also be given attention. First, the Sino-Japanese front line, from Shanxi to Guangdong, does not allow for distinguishing importance. However, in the past three to five months, the Japanese army has been managing Shanxi and coveting Shaanxi, and the signs are very clear. Now, they are attacking Hunan instead of encroaching on Shaanxi. Although this can be explained by the fact that they were unable to achieve their goals in managing Shanxi, after the signing of the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Japan, militarily speaking, it would not be difficult for the Japanese to transfer heavy troops from the Northeast to threaten Shanxi and Shaanxi, in order to achieve their plan to penetrate Shaanxi and cut off China's northwest transportation. If they are not doing this, is there a political or diplomatic reason behind it? This question cannot be speculated on. However, in the future, we may be able to discover something by considering this question in conjunction with the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan. Second, how long the Chinese army can hold Changsha and at what cost is still unknown. With the strength of the Japanese army's land and air forces, capturing Changsha is not a difficult task. Moreover, with the main force of the Japanese army in Hunan, the Chinese army will strategically not engage it with its main force. Therefore, if Changsha eventually falls to the Japanese army, it should not be considered unexpected. However, the gains made by the Chinese army in Jiangxi are at least unprecedented in the past three months. This shows that the morale and strength of the Chinese army's resistance, after twenty-seven months, can still maintain its strength. As the Japanese army advances further west, its front line becomes longer and thinner, which means that the opportunities for the Chinese army to counterattack increase, exposing its weaknesses even more. The Chinese army displaying its strength and the Japanese army exposing its weaknesses have a major impact on the morale of people at home and abroad, and are of significant value, beyond material gains and losses. Third, there is an unexpected phenomenon in the Sino-Japanese War: within China, the generals and soldiers who are actually engaged in the war of resistance, risking their lives, are full of vigor, while those who are experiencing ideological shifts in their awareness of the war of resistance are not the generals and soldiers. The recent war in Jiangxi is proof of this. Internationally, China has consistently refused to compromise, while the allied nations that claim to sympathize with China's war of resistance and share close interests with it frequently compromise. Since the outbreak of the European war, the trend towards compromise has been obvious. All these phenomena, in fact, are insufficient to sway China's war of resistance. The various castles in the air created by these phenomena may be sufficient to influence international opinion, adding a layer of confusion to the turbulent international situation. The recent fierce battles in Hunan and Jiangxi can use facts to illustrate that China is continuing its war of resistance, that China has the strength to continue its war of resistance, and that it is also a key to eliminating international confusion.

If China abandons its war of resistance, it will only solve the China problem for Japan. If China is determined to resist, it will be an important foundation for an equal resolution of the Sino-Japanese problem. If all problems become world problems and await a comprehensive solution, then whether Czechoslovakia, which perished without a fight, and Poland, which disintegrated in battle, have a place in the overall solution is a major question. China, on the other hand, must maintain a superior position in the overall solution by continuing its war of resistance. When the Soviet Union sent troops into Poland, it announced to the world that it did not expect Poland to collapse so quickly, to the point of not being a country anymore. Such words are not enough to serve as a lesson, but they can also add an annotation to the continuation of the war of resistance.

### England Increases Taxes by 200 Million Pounds to Cover Wartime Expenses; Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon Proposes Budget, Unanimously Approved by the House of Commons

London: British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon today proposed an emergency wartime budget in the House of Commons, stating that both direct and indirect taxes would be greatly increased, and the income tax would be increased to seven shillings and six pence per pound. Taxes on all luxury goods will also be increased. According to statistics, the increased taxes will generate 107,000,000 pounds this year and 126,500,000 pounds next year. The Chancellor stated that the price of victory, however high, is worth paying, as it is the price of freedom for the British people and allows Europe and the British people to live. The tax changes stipulated in the wartime budget include the following: (1) Income tax, which is currently five shillings and six pence, will be immediately increased to seven shillings, and further increased to seven shillings and six pence from January 1, 1940; (2) A tax will be levied on profits exceeding pre-war standards at 60%, or the current national defense contribution will be levied, whichever is greater; (3) Inheritance tax will be increased by 10% for estates valued between 10,000 and 50,000 pounds, and by 20% for estates above 50,000 pounds; (4) Beer tax will be increased by one penny per pint; (5) The basic tax on alcohol will be increased by ten shillings per standard gallon; (6) Tobacco tax will be increased by two shillings per pound, i.e., increased to three and a half pence per ounce; (7) Sugar tax will be increased by one penny per pound; (8) The tax on imported light wine will be increased by one shilling per gallon, and the tax on strong wine will be increased by four shillings per gallon. The main point of this budget is that the revised budget expenditure for this year is 1,933,000,000 pounds. The income of the revised budget, including the new tax revenue of 107,000,000 pounds, is 995,000,000 pounds. The difference between the two amounts is 938,000,000 pounds, which will be made up by raising debts. Among them, 500,000,000 pounds that have already been approved for raising will be allocated from the national defense bond.

After the Chancellor's speech, the House of Commons unanimously approved the resolution to implement the Chancellor's proposals within one hundred minutes. Both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party supported this wartime budget. Labor Party leader Clement Attlee said that there was an emergency budget eight years ago. In his opinion, what led England to this current situation was the nationally united government at that time. He agreed with the Chancellor's proposal to raise taxes to raise funds. He believed that increasing income tax was the right way to do it. In any case, the people of England should not delay paying for the war expenses until the future, nor should they borrow money and have future generations repay it. However, he could not agree with the changes to the child allowance plan, because this is not the time to encourage having fewer children. He also asked the government to reconsider increasing the sugar tax. He welcomed the wartime profit tax, but felt it would be best to eliminate wartime profits altogether.

Liberal Party leader Archibald Sinclair said that the financial burden on the people of the country is extremely heavy, but we have to take it on. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon has now explained the facts in detail to the people of the country, and no longer makes things vague and unclear as he did since he began to reorganize the military, which is commendable. The Liberal Party reserves the right to criticize certain points in the future, but at present, it feels that this bill should be supported. He asked the Chancellor to consider forming a General National Expenditure Committee to audit the use of funds and prevent waste and corruption. Although this budget is very serious, it is still far from the limit of the country's financial resources. The people of the country can still accept this kind of sacrifice as a necessary method for achieving victory.

Communist Party member John McGovern said that this budget is a terrible footnote to the capitalist system. He does not pay attention to how much the income tax or wealth tax is increased, but he is prepared to bet his life that the rich will be richer after the end of the war than they are today.

Independent Conservative Party member William Mabane then spoke, expressing his doubts about the windfall tax and asking why the excess profits tax was only limited to 60%, and advocating that a capital tax should be applied now instead of waiting until after the end of the war. The debate in the House of Commons was temporarily suspended at this point and will be discussed again tomorrow.

When Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon presented his budget, he first said that when he presented the budget to the House of Commons at the end of April this year, he estimated that the expenditure for this year would be 1,323,000,000 pounds, of which 630,000,000 pounds would be for national defense, and he expected the income to be 942,000,000 pounds. The shortfall of 380,000,000 pounds would be raised within this year. Before the Financial Law was passed, the amount of national defense expenditure for this year had increased to 730,000,000 pounds, and the amount required to be raised at that time had reached 480,000,000 pounds. When Congress was adjourned in August, the total amount of expenditure for this year was 1,453,000,000 pounds, of which 502,000,000 pounds had to be obtained from borrowing. All these huge numbers are based on the assumption that England would not be at war this year. After the outbreak of the war on September 3, Congress quickly passed a supplementary appropriation of 500,000,000 pounds. He could not guarantee that this number would be enough to meet all the needs until the end of the current budget year, i.e., the end of March next year. The total amount of expenditure for this year will be around 2,000,000,000 pounds. There is no need to say that a new budget urgently needs to be prepared. This war has caused England to encounter special economic difficulties. If it is not dealt with in an appropriate manner and with a courageous spirit, England's ability to continue fighting the war to achieve a victorious ending will be greatly weakened. Finance is the fourth weapon of national defense. If finance fails, then the entire war effort that it supports will collapse. There are only two ways to make the best use of productivity, namely, taxes and borrowing. England must of course use both. The amount of money needed by the treasury is unprecedented. In order to meet the huge wartime needs, taxes have to be heavy. However, it is obviously impossible to rely entirely on tax revenue to pay for all war expenses, so it must be supplemented by the income from large-scale national defense bonds. When the issuance of national defense bonds is announced in the future, it is the duty of every citizen to enthusiastically contribute and actively subscribe. As for the issuance of new national debt, the time is not yet ripe. The solicitation of various bonds is often left to the future. At present, it is hoped that people and organizations across the country will not use capital for unnecessary purposes, and should try to be frugal, so that they can transfer their financial resources to subscribe to new debt issued for the continuation of the war. This emergency budget will require the people of the country to make major sacrifices. An income tax of five shillings and six pence is already very high, but in a war environment, it still needs to be greatly increased. The proposed additional amount is not intended to be fully implemented this year. For the whole year, the standard income tax should be seven shillings and six pence per pound. However, this year, it is proposed to set the standard income tax at seven shillings. Five shillings and six pence will be paid in the first quarter, and seven shillings and six pence will be paid in the other three quarters. On average, seven shillings will be paid each quarter. As for the income tax surcharge, this tax rate will range from fifteen pence to nine shillings and six pence. Those with an income of 2,000 pounds will pay fifteen pence, while those with an income of more than 30,000 pounds will pay nine shillings and six pence. In this way, the surcharge alone can generate 5 million pounds this year and 8 million pounds for the whole year. From today onwards, inheritance worth more than 10,000 pounds and less than 50,000 pounds will be taxed by one-tenth, and more than 50,000 pounds will be taxed by two-tenths. It is estimated that this item can generate 6 million pounds for the whole year. The poll tax will be increased from tomorrow onwards, and it is expected to generate 11,000,000 pounds this year and 27,000,000 pounds for the whole year. The price of alcohol will be increased, which can generate 3,500,000 pounds annually. The excess profit tax will be applied to all industrial and commercial groups in accordance with the method of the munitions industry profit tax. The Chancellor then said that the capital tax had been studied, but it was felt that it was not appropriate to do it during the war. The above-mentioned tax increases can generate 107,000,000 pounds this year and 226,000,000 pounds for the whole year. The Chancellor concluded by saying that such huge numbers of revenue and expenditure should not be regarded as evidence of government abuse. In fact, all kinds of arrangements made since the outbreak of the war require funding, and the machinery of war is especially expensive. For example, a new type of aircraft costs three to seven times more than a similar one in 1918. The Ministry of Finance has agreed with the Ministry of Defense to invite qualified and experienced people from the business community to audit the various proposals for new expenditures, which are strictly in line with needs and finances.

### Portugal Plans to Send Warships to Aid England and France

London: The Portuguese government has maintained a friendly neutral attitude towards England in the current war. Because of the agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union and the division of Poland, it is very angry and is said to be taking a hostile attitude towards Germany and taking various measures to aid England and France in the naval aspect. The country's main fleet, including twelve of the latest warships, has been concentrated in a certain place, and each naval base has also been replenished. The entire navy can be mobilized in the shortest possible time. If so, it can make a great contribution to preventing German submarine activities. It goes without saying that it is helpful to England and France. This is also more in line with Portuguese public opinion, because public opinion does not advocate sending an expeditionary force to France to help in the war, but would rather aid England and France in the naval aspect.

### French Artillery Threatens Saarlouis; Report that German Troops Have Withdrawn; French Say Reconnaissance Units Absolutely Necessary for Large-Scale Activities

Paris: According to French claims, the German troops in Saarlouis were unable to defend the town due to the intense artillery and machine-gun fire from the French, and have completely withdrawn. The French army has surrounded part of the city. It is expected that the German army will attempt to relieve the siege. It is also reported that the French army is seriously threatening Lebach, 30 miles east of Saarlouis, which is under "constant artillery fire." The German army between Lebach and Homburg is now quite uneasy, because the French army has occupied the Worringen spur that extends into German territory, and its ridge can control the Homburg River. German artillery has been bombarding the spur for several days. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Paris: According to reliable sources, apart from artillery battles, there are no important military operations on the Rhine front. German troops are now concentrated in the three towns of Berre, Besch, and Bouche along the Moselle River. French artillery is constantly bombarding these places, preventing the German army from completing preparations for a general offensive. Since the outbreak of the war, the French authorities have avoided taking any adventurous actions, except for ordering reconnaissance teams to carry out reconnaissance in the area between the "Maginot Line" and the Siegfried Line, and have been taking steady and solid steps. Therefore, they have been able to attack the outposts of the Siegfried Line and achieve great success. So far, some losses are inevitable, but they are negligible. When the French army first entered German territory, the front of the German positions was covered with barbed wire, landmines, and various traps, and tank defense lines were built, with bunkers made of reinforced concrete and equipped with cannons and machine guns. All of these must be destroyed before they can advance. The French army first used artillery fire to destroy various fortifications and detonate landmines, then sent a platoon of soldiers as guides, followed by a regiment of soldiers, to advance to the enemy's positions under the cover of artillery fire. At the same time, they dispatched many infantrymen, carrying long sticks, to search for various suspicious objects along the way, such as tin cans and steel helmets, which are sufficient to hide explosives and fuses, and must be destroyed to ensure the safety of the advance. In addition, there is another method to detonate landmines, which is to use huge heavy-duty trucks, fully loaded with sandbags, and order them to advance slowly, while the drivers jump out in advance to pave the way for the infantry. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Paris: The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 47, which is very brief and only states that "our reconnaissance units on the front line are quite active." (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Capital of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg: French and German troops engaged in fierce artillery battles in the area of ​​Berre, Besch, and Rouge at around 4 p.m. today (Havas dispatch, 17th)

London: The Daily Express recently reported that British planes again flew over various cities and towns in northeastern Germany last night to distribute leaflets, and then safely flew back to their base. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Berlin: Former Japanese Army Minister General Terauchi led a military delegation yesterday, accompanied by German officers, to inspect the situation in the west. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Capital of Switzerland: French and German aircraft have been active in the Kunz area on the border of Basel, Switzerland, more than twice in the past 24 hours. The first time, many French aircraft flew over the German defense line and were immediately fired upon by the German anti-aircraft artillery. The second time, many German aircraft flew to the French positions between the Rhine River and Siérenes, and the French anti-aircraft artillery bombarded them. Both air raids can be seen from the Swiss border. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Paris: Today's communique here stated that there was no major battle on the entire Western Front last night. The German army suffered a setback in an attack west of Saarlouis. Maritime commerce is now operating normally due to the completion of the naval and air force escort system. On September 27, British and French aircraft worked together to shoot down several German fighters. French reconnaissance aircraft were quite active at night. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Paris: The Petit Parisien today detailed the air battles on the Western Front, stating that on September 24, five French fighters fought nine German fighters in the sky. As a result, two enemy planes were shot down, and soon two more caught fire and fell. One French plane was lost, and another crashed in its own territory. The pilot jumped out of the plane. It is said that the fifth German plane also crashed. On September 25, three French planes fought five German planes, and as a result, the Germans lost three of them, while the French only lost one. Of the other two German planes, one was hit and one escaped. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

London: A military commentator today declared that although the Allied forces seemed to be moving slowly, Allied Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin had not lost the initiative. It is still recalled that there were periods of silence of several weeks or months before and after major battles in the last European war. Today's situation is similar. If a rash attack is launched, it may create a dangerous salient that is easily attacked by the Germans and suffer adverse results. The Siegfried Line is specially designed to facilitate counterattacks on salients. The French authorities are now satisfied with the achievements they have already made. French artillery and infantry have leveled many German defenses and machine-gun nests, and consolidated the areas they have occupied. General Gamelin's strategy seems to be to force the Germans to reveal their plans. All parties admit that Germany will soon launch a major offensive, but it is not yet clear where it will start. At present, the Germans are deeply worried about the French occupation of the Homburg Heights, which are between Saarlouis and Wissembourg. Although the Germans often bombard it, they have failed to damage the French position. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

London: Yesterday and last night, the British Air Force again flew into Germany and the Western Front for reconnaissance. Although they encountered resistance, they still brought back valuable information and safely returned to their original defense. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Although they encountered some obstacles along the way, they still obtained important information, and then safely returned to their base." (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### The Defenders of Warsaw Submit Ceasefire Proposal; Speculation of City Surrender Today

Paris: A communiqué from the Polish commander in Warsaw states that due to the extremely perilous situation of Warsaw's civilians, substantial material damage, severe water shortages, and the looming threat of epidemics, a 24-hour ceasefire has been proposed. Warsaw is now completely destroyed and continues to suffer relentless shelling. Water reservoirs and filtration plants are destroyed, making relief efforts difficult due to constant bombing. Memorials and churches are in ruins, none spared. No response to the proposal has been received. A previous communiqué stated that Warsaw shot down 13 German aircraft yesterday, totaling 108 German aircraft shot down. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)

Berlin: The German High Command released a communiqué tonight, briefly stating that Warsaw has surrendered unconditionally and will formally surrender to the German High Command on the 29th of this month. The number of Polish soldiers stationed in Warsaw that can be currently confirmed is over 100,000. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)

Berlin: General Göring issued an address to the Luftwaffe on the occasion of Warsaw's surrender. It stated that the Polish army had been defeated in a matter of days. The Polish Air Force also engaged effectively, but the German army prevailed with blitzkrieg tactics. He was proud of the Luftwaffe's collaborative operations. The Air Force, with decisive action, controlled enemy airspace from the start. Not a single Polish aircraft invaded German territory, ensuring the safety of the homeland. The advancing ground forces were also able to complete their great military mission. The German navy also received the assistance of the air force. The recklessly provocative Polish army has collapsed. The achievements of the German army are unprecedented in history. We bow in mourning to the fallen soldiers of the Air Force. The spirits of the Air Force martyrs remain with us. Their sacrifices place upon us a sacred duty. General Göring concluded by saying that when we fight for the freedom of Germany, I know we can rely on the Luftwaffe to strive for an eternal Germany. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Discusses Neutrality Act Amendment; Pittman Bitterly Complains of the Harm of the Arms Embargo; Senate Scheduled to Begin Debate on the 2nd of Next Month

Washington: Regarding the Neutrality Act amendment, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently spoke with prominent Republicans, namely Senator Borah. They immediately agreed that the Foreign Relations Committee would meet tomorrow morning to discuss the Pittman amendment. Pittman later stated to a Havas reporter that his draft bill could be reviewed and passed by the Foreign Relations Committee with a majority of five or six votes and then submitted to the Senate for discussion. People in the Capitol lounge expect that the House of Representatives will wait until the Senate votes on the amendment before submitting it for discussion, but it can only express approval and cannot make any amendments. If it is indeed approved, the speakers of both houses will appoint several members to form a joint committee to consolidate the views of the two houses and draft another amendment for a vote in both houses. However, political figures expect that after the Senate passes the amendment, the House of Representatives need not discuss it and can approve it with a majority vote. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

New York: Senator Pittman, Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, gave a radio address today, saying that as long as the arms embargo exists, the United States cannot maintain neutrality. We established this law because we wanted to prevent American ships from being attacked by submarines. The embargo prohibits the export of arms, ammunition, and implements of war. However, we now know that belligerent nations want to prevent not only what is stipulated by the American embargo from reaching enemy countries, but also what is not stipulated by the embargo. Those who oppose the repeal of this embargo believe that selling arms to belligerent nations is tantamount to participating in the massacre. But isn't the United States similarly participating in the massacre by allowing the export of gasoline for airplanes and scrap iron for bombs to Japan? As for the argument that repealing the embargo will greatly help England and France, there is currently no international law or other laws to interfere with the Soviet Union or Italy from transporting arms, ammunition, and implements of war to Poland. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)

Washington: Republican Senator Borah recently told reporters that, in his opinion, the Neutrality Act amendment drafted by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, could be reviewed and passed tomorrow and submitted to the Senate for discussion. People generally infer from this that the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee no longer oppose the Pittman amendment. The Senate may begin discussion on October 2, at which time, among the 96 senators, those in favor of repealing the arms embargo clause may account for a majority of 56. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Washington: Presidential Secretary O'Leary stated last night that President Roosevelt's amendment to the Neutrality Act is sure to pass. Senators supporting the president's proposal will broadcast on the radio to promote it to the public. Many letters supporting or opposing the amendment to the Neutrality Act have been sent to the senators. Congressional sources say that there are already 56 senators supporting the president's proposal. The proportion of people in the House of Representatives who support the president is even greater. The administration is not prepared to present any new proposals before the amendment to the Neutrality Act is passed. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)

Washington: After the Neutrality Act amendment drafted by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is established, American aircraft will not be allowed to land in the territory of any belligerent nation. Pan American Airways, because it operates North Atlantic routes, will inevitably feel inconvenienced and has informed the State Department of this. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Washington: Debate on the US government's new Neutrality Act will begin in the Senate on October 2. Opposition leader Borah claims that if the Foreign Relations Committee extends the discussion, the opposition will have more time to study it. People expect that the committee will pass the bill soon. Those who generally support this bill now hold an optimistic view that the Senate can act quickly. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

### Pan-American Conference Holds Secret Meeting; Discusses the Delineation of Safe Zones; Cuban Proposal Receives Unanimous Approval

Capital of Panama: The Pan-American Conference held a plenary secret meeting today. It is reported that the issue of delineating safe zones on both the Pacific and Atlantic sides of the American continent was discussed. Regarding this, the proposal put forward by Cuba has been unanimously endorsed in principle by the representatives of the participating countries. What is being studied now is only the technical issues. In addition, the lists of prohibited goods determined by the European belligerent nations, as well as the issue of freedom of commerce for neutral countries, were also submitted for discussion. The representative of Uruguay expressed a willingness to maintain trade relations with the neutral countries in Europe and advocated that various food raw materials and industrial products, that are not used for war, should be removed from the list of prohibited goods. The representatives of Chile and Argentina immediately endorsed this. In addition, there are more than fifty German ships currently in American territorial waters. The representatives of various countries at the conference believe that a swift resolution should be reached on how to deal with them. Among them, the representative of Chile advocated that they should be detained to offset the value of goods owed by Poland to the American countries. (Joint Havas dispatch, 27th)

Panama: The representatives of Argentina and Uruguay proposed at the Pan-American Conference today that belligerent nations should not list food and clothing as prohibited goods. This proposal is aimed at the British blockade policy, because it violates international law and affects the trade of neutral countries. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

Panama City: The US delegation has submitted to the Pan-American Conference a proposal for discussion that belligerent submarines should not be allowed to enter American ports and territorial waters, otherwise they will be detained. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

### British Main Fleet in the North Sea Undergoes Bombing; German Side Claims Two British Ships Hit; British Side Claims Two German Aircraft Shot Down

London: First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill reported to the House of Commons this afternoon on the situation of the British main fleet being attacked by a squadron of German aircraft in the North Sea yesterday. He briefly stated that we did not suffer any damage, and two German aircraft were shot down. A destroyer was dispatched to capture four pilots. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Berlin: Regarding the report by British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill that German aircraft bombing British warships in the North Sea never hit anything and that three aircraft were shot down, General Göring, Commander-in-Chief of the German Air Force, immediately issued a statement refuting this. It briefly stated that a British aircraft carrier was hit by a 500-kilogram bomb, and a main battleship was hit by two 250-kilogram bombs, hitting the front and middle parts. The destructive power of these bombs is self-evident. None of the German aircraft that dropped the bombs were hit by British ships and all safely flew back to base. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)

Berlin: A German Air Force spokesman declared that the German Air Force's bombing of British warships in the North Sea should be regarded as having major significance, because although the Air Force had attacked submarines, the bombing of warships was still the first time. At the beginning of the war, British aircraft attempted to attack German naval bases, losing 50% of their aircraft. Therefore, the fact that the German Air Force damaged a British main battleship and destroyed an aircraft carrier in the North Sea is recorded in military history as the first time a warship was bombed by aircraft. Naval experts point out that Britain only has six aircraft carriers and two seaplane carriers, and the "Courageous" has already been sunk by a German submarine. German aircraft have also sunk a British aircraft carrier, and the current sinking of another is a major loss for Britain. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

London: According to today's official statement, the German bombers that attacked the British fleet in the North Sea on Tuesday used low-hanging clouds to skim over British warships. Other aircraft flying above 12,000 feet also sometimes used gaps in the clouds to attack British cruisers. However, because the British fleet's defense was very effective, the German aircraft could not find their targets. At that time, the British fleet was protecting a slightly damaged British submarine returning to Britain. German aircraft took this opportunity to make ineffective attacks. As a result, two German aircraft were shot down, and at least one other was seriously damaged. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)

Gao'an: The Chinese army in northern Jiangxi is now discussing the recovery of Luofang, Yecheng, and Shangfu. The Japanese army that had sneaked into Ganfang is being encircled by the Chinese army. After suffering a disastrous defeat northeast of Gao'an, the Japanese army gathered the remaining 2,000-plus men and invaded west from Fengxin, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chinese near Shangfu for several days. In order to annihilate the remaining Japanese forces, the Chinese lured the Japanese deep. The Chinese army in Luofang, Yecheng, Shangfu, and other places west of Fengxin successively advanced to nearby areas and launched fierce attacks. Starting on the 26th, a full-scale counterattack was launched. Although the Japanese army resisted, they were ultimately overwhelmed by the Chinese army's valiant advance and intense firepower, and they showed signs of collapse that evening. The Chinese army launched a night-long assault and finally recovered Luofang, Yecheng, and Shangfu successively at 9 am on the 27th. In addition to a portion that retreated to Fengxin, the rest fled into the nearby mountains, leaving corpses scattered everywhere and abandoning a large amount of military supplies. Their embarrassment was almost identical to the defeat at Gao'an. While wiping out the remaining Japanese forces, the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to quickly advance and besiege Ganfang Town. The Japanese army in that area, with their retreat cut off, was extremely panicked and released poison gas to stop the Chinese army's advance. The Chinese army, with high morale, took advantage of the victory to bravely break into the village in the afternoon and launch street fighting, which is currently underway. (Dispatch, 27th)

Associated Press report

### Wang Chonghui Talks About the Possibility of the US Mediation of the War Being Relatively High; China's Foreign Policy Is Based on Treaties; Willing to Cooperate With All Friendly Countries

Chongqing: According to what Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui said to a reporter from the Associated Press, the National Government is determined to continue the war of resistance until it achieves final victory. As for China's foreign policy, there has been no change to date. China's foreign policy is entirely based on treaties, especially the Nine-Power Treaty, the most important of which is to ensure that these treaties that protect China's independence and integrity can be implemented. China is willing to cooperate economically with all countries that are friendly to China. If Japan can cooperate with us on a completely equal footing, then of course we can also cooperate with it economically. Unfortunately, Japan's so-called cooperation is in fact nothing more than wanting to control China. If so, then we have no possibility of cooperating with Japan. However, the Nine-Power Treaty and other treaties are not only respected by various countries, but also signed by Japan in 1922. Now Japan is brazenly disregarding everything and destroying them, so what other way can China take other than to exert all its strength to resist? Furthermore, in addition to being respected by the United States, Britain, and France, even the Soviet Union, which did not sign the treaty, is extremely concerned about the Nine-Power Treaty. Judging from Japan's current exhausted state, it is actually impossible to completely "subdue" China. Since the United States lodged a protest with Japan on December 31, 1938, for violating the Nine-Power Treaty, Britain and France also followed the United States and lodged protests. On the other hand, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, China and the Soviet Union immediately established a non-aggression treaty. Therefore, those surrounding Japan are all countries that oppose Japan's actions. What Japan can comfort itself with is an empty anti-Communist treaty, but as of today, even this anti-Communist treaty has been torn up by Germany. Therefore, today's Japan can be said to be in a state of absolute isolation. But before this, the United States had announced the abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty. If Japan still does not make a statement of respecting treaties, then the United States will refuse to enter into a new commercial treaty with Japan. The Japanese side is well aware of the importance of this point, so it is thinking about improving US-Japan relations. Nomura's appointment as Japanese Foreign Minister is aimed at establishing a new commercial treaty in Japan. Therefore, the position that the United States currently occupies is truly of great importance. In this situation, it is very easy for the United States to persuade the Japanese side to accept President Roosevelt's mediation. At the same time, it is also easy for Roosevelt to submit the proposal to the Japanese side. This proposal is a way for the Japanese side to end the "China Incident" and avoid moving towards destruction. At the same time, if peace is achieved at this time, it will also be in Japan's interest, because if Japan does not fight against China during this European war, it can greatly expand its foreign trade. Therefore, if President Roosevelt comes forward to mediate at this time, the possibility of success will be high. The reporter then asked Wang about the peace terms recently spread among Chinese people in Chongqing and Hong Kong. According to the information obtained from that side, if the Japanese side can provide reliable guarantees for troop withdrawal and guarantee that the speed of troop withdrawal can be in accordance with the opinions of neutral military experts, then the National Government may order the soldiers in all war zones to stop attacking the Japanese army. When the Japanese army withdraws, the Chinese army will follow and reoccupy the locations withdrawn by the Japanese side. After this work is completed, the Chinese people can regain their territory, and the Japanese workers and peasants can return to their country to rebuild their old careers. Because of his position as Foreign Minister, Dr. Wang was unwilling to criticize these speculative peace terms, but he expressed his personal opinion that the National Government could accept such terms. (Associated Press dispatch, 28th)

### The Island of Meizhou off the Coast of Fujian Has Been Recovered

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing

Although the sky was dark and cloudy, the Japanese aircraft still flew recklessly westward and then entered the suburbs of Chongqing. After blindly dropping bombs, they returned east along the river.

### Armed Japanese Search Tianjin Associated Press

Tianjin: The Tianjin office of the Associated Press and the American Wireless Radio Station were suddenly searched by plainclothes Japanese military police this morning. The British and American authorities here have been asked to investigate the situation so that appropriate measures can be taken. According to explanations from the British Concession Police Department, the British side had allowed Japanese military police to search for "anti-Japanese elements" at 142 Yingzhong Street (i.e., Third Road) without knowing that the Associated Press and the American Wireless Radio Station were located in that building. The British police authorities also stated that the British side had initially only permitted two Japanese personnel to enter the premises, but the actual number of Japanese exceeded the agreed limit. It is understood that the Japanese search area extends throughout the British Concession and has not been completed as of 12:00 noon today. According to Japanese claims, several anti-Japanese elements within the concession have been arrested. It is clear that the British police authorities have implicitly allowed Japanese personnel to arrest Chinese people whom they consider "anti-Japanese." Furthermore, although the owner of the American Wireless Radio Station, Mr. Nicoll, was threatened with a pistol, he ultimately prevented the Japanese from taking away telegrams. It is said that most of these wireless telegrams belong to American businesses here. This wireless radio station was specifically authorized by the British Concession authorities. Since the telegrams transmitted and received by the station are not subject to Japanese inspection, foreign merchants here are very pleased. (Associated Press dispatch, 28th)

Tianjin: This morning, the British and French Concession authorities granted the Japanese request to conduct a joint search within the concessions. The American-owned Pentreath Wireless Radio Station was also invaded. It is said that this was due to an incorrect address. After discovering the error, the Japanese military police immediately ordered the searchers to withdraw. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)

### Intense Fighting Near Chaozhou and Shantou; Japanese Attempt to Attack Huiyang; Landings at Renshan and Xia Yong; Strong Chinese Defenses

Hong Kong Correspondent: Since September, the war situation in eastern Guangdong has entered a new stage where the Chinese army has taken the initiative, turning defense into offense. Along the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway, they have fully demonstrated new tactics. Over the past three months, they have repeatedly attacked Chaoan City six times and Chenghai City three times. The Chinese army has strategically abandoned these locations on its own, avoiding large-scale positional battles with the Japanese army. They seize and abandon the strongholds along the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway, taking away ammunition, supplies, and provisions before abandoning them.

Japanese Concentrate Reinforcements in Chaozhou and Shantou

From September 6th to 12th, the Japanese army transferred units stationed on Hainan Island, Zhou Island, Nanpeng Island, Nanao Island, and along the coast to reinforce Chaozhou and Shantou. Judging from their actual strength, they still cannot exceed 8,000 men, barely enough to compensate for casualties. The newly arrived troops advanced towards Jieyang, and Qian Gang and Jiao Tang along the Tuo River tributary were occupied by the Taiwan Garrison Command on the 11th. This tributary is south of Sangpu Mountain and can reach Qu Xi and Feng Kou in Jieyang, or bypass Jin Gou, Yu Jiao, and Da Zhai, and Qi Tou, flanking the Chinese positions on the Anjie Road, coordinating with the Japanese forces in Fuyang, Wuyang, Guan Chao, and Jinshi City to attack the guerrilla base on Sangpu Mountain from both sides. The Chinese assault force is divided into three routes: the main force on the Anjie Road front, the right wing moving down the Han River from Fengshun Tiandong Xu, Shangxia Ronggui Lake, attacking the Zhugao Mountain and Yixi Station, and the Bijiashan head of Dongjin Bridge, and the left wing using Sangpu Mountain as a base to attack Anbu and Caitang.  The regular army, Chen Kan and Liang Huasheng's divisions, support these three routes. Hua Zhenzhong's brigade and Zou Hong's security regiment, along with local militias, serve as the vanguard. As for Raoping and Chenghai, located in the rear, elite troops are stationed to defend Longdu, Lianhua Mountain, Zhanglin, Donglong, Yanzao, Huanggang, and Zhalin, implementing a scorched earth policy, setting up defenses across the river. Chenghai City is very close to Anbu, Ou Ting, and Shangpeng, only thirty li from Shantou, and has become a buffer zone between the two sides. Because there is no natural defense, neither side stations large forces there.

Chinese Forces Attack Chaoan

On September 11th, the Chinese army withdrew from Chaoan City, and the Japanese army redeployed outside the northwest gate, cutting off communication between the city and the surrounding villages, searching house to house for hidden guerrillas. Five to six hundred farmers were arrested in the villages, either imprisoned or forced to work. One to two hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry troops explored the outskirts of the city. On the morning of the 13th, Japanese troops from Chaozhou, using three tanks, led infantry and cavalry to advance towards Fengxi and Fuyang. Chen's company of the Hua Zhenzhong Brigade, stationed at Fuyang Station, seeing the fierce advance of the Japanese army, retreated to the Wuyang Mountain positions at 10:00 AM. Two Japanese aircraft dropped over ten bombs on Wuyang. The Chinese army then shifted to defend Qingmao Mountain, holding the Anjie Road front near Fengxi and Fengling. Fierce fighting broke out on the afternoon of the 13th, and the Japanese army was defeated. Rongzao, the porcelain production area of Chaozhou, was 80% destroyed by bombs. Bowl and plate production will depend entirely on Gao Bei, Dapu from now on. Anbu was recaptured by the Chinese army on the 13th. The Japanese army lost Anbu twice in September, suffering over 500 casualties and losing hundreds of loads of military supplies, guns, and ammunition. On the morning of the 13th, reinforcements arrived from Shantou, attacking Sangpu Mountain from three routes: Yuepu, Pengzhou Suo, and Dajing Meixitou. Chinese guerrilla and security forces were scattered in Shaxi, Hongan, Caitang, Hailian Mountain, Wuta Gang, with dispersed targets. Over 400 Japanese troops first gathered at Longxi Middle School in Anbu and were immediately surrounded by Chinese guerrillas from all sides. In the afternoon, the Japanese suffered 50 to 60 casualties and retreated to the station to hold their ground. The Japanese troops attacking Sangpu Mountain dared not advance further due to fighting behind their lines. At this time, Zou Hong, the commander of the Huichao-Mei Garrison, had moved his headquarters to Liuhuang Mountain in Fengshun to coordinate the attack on Chaozhou. Wu Qiwai established the forward command post of the Ninth Group Army at Jieyang Xi Chang and Maya Du. Hua Zhenzhong's Chaozhou-Shantou Garrison Headquarters moved to Sangpu Mountain. Large forces from Xingning and Wuhua moved towards Chaoan in an endless stream.

Japanese Attempt to Attack Huiyang

On the night of the 12th, over a thousand fresh Chinese troops descended eastwards by bamboo raft from Liulong, launching a fierce attack on Zhugao Mountain, Yixi Station, and besieging Bijiashan at the Dongyang dike bridge in Guihu and Caijiayuan. These two places are six li northeast of Chao City, separated by a river. That night, the Japanese army, unsure of the real situation, dared not send reinforcements. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese suffered over 200 casualties and retreated back into the city. On the 13th, the Chinese army completely occupied Yixi Bridge, and the city was in chaos. The sound of artillery fire was thunderous outside the city, and shells rained down on Jinshan and Hulu Mountain. The Chinese army had already charged to the outside of the northwest gate. The Japanese command frantically moved boxes out of the east gate and onto motorboats. Chaozhou and Shantou were surrounded on all sides. Having suffered defeats in Chaozhou and Shantou, the Japanese turned their aggression to the coast of Haifeng, Shanwei, and Daya Bay in Huiyang. It is reported that landings have also occurred at Renshan and Xia Yong, with plans to directly approach Danshui and attack Huiyang. On the 13th, Japanese aircraft dropped bombs along the Dong River, and the towns and markets along the river were evacuated automatically. The departure times of boats and vehicles were changed to nighttime. Xingning and Meixian also opened night markets, with few pedestrians during the day. This is a sign that the Japanese are shifting their invasion to the Dong River. The Chinese military authorities have already made careful arrangements in the mountains of Zijin, Haifeng, and Lufeng. Since the spring, the militia of each county has been voluntarily entering the mountains for training. Even if coastal villages are lost, it will not have much impact on the military strategy.

### Smooth Cargo Transport Between Hong Kong and Vietnam; Haiphong Customs Builds More Warehouses; More Vehicles Being Planned

Hong Kong Correspondent: In the last six months, the shipping business between Hong Kong and Haiphong has developed rapidly. To adapt to the environment, the number of ships traveling the Hong Kong-Haiphong line has increased to over thirty. The reason is that after the fall of Guangzhou, most import and export goods were rerouted through Haiphong, which has gradually become the central hub for import and export goods. In recent months, the cargo volume on this line has not decreased despite the increase in the number of ships and the rise in freight rates. The goods transported from Vietnam to Hong Kong are mostly local products such as tung oil, tin, medicinal materials, minerals, and other miscellaneous goods.

Due to the congestion of cargo, the warehouses in Haiphong are insufficient. The congestion of goods in warehouses is similar to that of shipping. As a result, goods shipped from Hong Kong to Haiphong often cannot find a fixed warehouse for storage upon arrival. Most of the goods have to be stored in the open space near the customs, where they are easily damaged by rain and sun. The customs has partially restricted the import of goods to reduce congestion, causing great difficulties for both customers and shipping companies. It is understood that recently, the British companies Taikoo and Jardine sent two ships to Haiphong as lighters for storing goods. However, due to the small size of the ships and the large amount of cargo, it is still difficult to solve the above problems. In view of the congestion of cargo, the customs has

Built More Warehouses

Most have been completed. Various transportation companies have registered with the customs in advance to store goods on behalf of customers. Shanghai Hongyun Shipping Bureau, Weitai Bank, and various customs brokers have registered warehouses with Haiphong Customs. Jardine Matheson has recently dispatched a ship to Haiphong as a lighter. The ship has sailed directly from Hong Kong to Haiphong a few days ago. At the same time, companies are also working hard to increase the number of vehicles on the highway from Haiphong to the mainland. Therefore, it is expected that the congestion of cargo transport between Hong Kong and Vietnam will be improved in the short term. It is reported that the water and land freight rates in Haiphong have increased several times, but merchants do not find it difficult. They only hope that the goods can be transported and delivered as soon as possible.

### Sharp Drop in Prices of Eastern Zhejiang Silk

Yongkang Correspondent: This year's price of local silk in Zhejiang Province once soared, then fell to about 45 yuan per hundred taels. Later, because the local silk traders in the guerrilla areas of western Zhejiang were heavily suppressed by the puppet regime, who collected a "unified tax" of 30% and purchased the silk with puppet currency, the silk traders suffered heavy losses and all automatically imported the silk into eastern Zhejiang. Moreover, Su and Wan Province, including Yixing, Liyang, Guangde, Qingyang, and other counties, had a bumper harvest of spring cocoons this year, and the accumulated silk, totaling more than 3,000 dan, was also transported to Zhejiang for sale, resulting in an oversupply in the local silk market in eastern Zhejiang. Recently, due to the outbreak of the European War, the sales of local silk in Shanghai were suddenly affected, and the price fell sharply. According to reliable sources, the average price of local silk in Shaoxing and Huashe has fallen to about 37 yuan per hundred taels, and the influx of goods is still surging, so the price is expected to continue to fall.

### Exhaustion of the Japanese Invading Army - Japanese Casualties and Sickness Increasing Daily - Plan to Implement Control in Shantou Has Failed

Shantou Correspondent: It has been nearly three months since Chaozhou and Shantou fell into enemy hands. The Chinese and Japanese armies are locked in a seesaw battle along the railway. Observing the Japanese troops at various strongholds, their equipment is incomplete, their uniforms are disheveled, and their morale is low. According to a translator in the Japanese propaganda team (originally from Jiaoling County, Guangdong Province, residing in Taiwan, having acquired Taiwanese citizenship, and forced to come to China to participate in the invasion; when leaving Taiwan, five families were jointly responsible, and if he escaped en route, all five families would be executed), the Japanese military strictly controls news in Japan and Taiwan. The number of troops sent and the number of casualties are unknown to anyone. However, it is known that every family has men serving in the army, and since the year before last, none have been discharged and returned home. Before the "July 7th" Incident, the Japanese army had a total of 25 divisions, from the 1st to the 25th, plus a Guards Division. When the Battle of Shanghai began, 26 divisions were fighting in China. By the time of the fall of Nanjing and the Battle of Xuzhou, reserve divisions had already been mobilized to participate (i.e., the 101st to 125th Divisions). When the Chinese army shifted its positions to defend Wuhan, Japan again greatly expanded its army, formally expanding the divisions to 35 and also expanding the reserve divisions to 35, totaling 70 divisions. The locations of the Japanese army are roughly as follows: (1) 15 divisions stationed in the Northeast (Korea) to defend against Russia; (2) 15 divisions stationed in North China (10 divisions in Shanxi, 1 division each on the PingSui, PingHan, and JinPu lines, and 1 division each in Hebei and Shandong); (3) 15 divisions in Central China (5 divisions at the intersection of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, 3 divisions at the intersection of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei, 2 divisions along the Yangtze River, 3 divisions in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, and 2 divisions in Shanghai and its vicinity); (4) 5 divisions in South China (3.5 divisions in Guangzhou, a total of 1 division in Shantou and Qiongya, and half a division on the coastal islands). In total, the Japanese army has 50 divisions stationed in China, but each division is severely understaffed. On average, each division with four regiments and two battalions has roughly 16,000 to 20,000 men. The fighting strength is five percent worse than during the Battle of Xuzhou. In terms of quality, it is even more different compared to before the Battle of Wuhan. The offensive efficiency and firepower have dropped to 50%, and they can no longer exert the power of the "August 13th" Incident. Japanese veteran military men often sigh among themselves that things are getting worse and worse. To defeat the main force of the Chinese army and end the incident, the effect obtained is a futile dream in history. The first phase of the three major battles (Shanghai, Xuzhou, Wuhan) has shown that the Chinese fighting power is getting stronger and stronger. The number of Japanese soldiers killed, wounded, and dying from disease is increasing daily, gradually to the point where they have no further offensive power. Even to defend the strongholds and major cities requires all their strength and a huge price to be able to sleep soundly for one night. To revive the market and develop industry is almost impossible under the military stalemate.

At the beginning of the Japanese occupation of Shantou, they had already drafted a plan to restore the railway, water, and electricity companies and merge them into the Fuda Company for operation. When the Bank of Taiwan reopened in Shantou on July 15, it had a extravagant hope for economic control, wanting to grasp the financial power in one hand. Every year, overseas Chinese in Nanyang remit 60 to 70 million yuan, and they planned to absorb it all into the bank and issue military scrip to the families of overseas Chinese. However, the facts before them have shattered these fantasies. (1) The tracks of the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway continue to be demolished by guerrillas, and even the sleepers cannot be placed on the roadbed. It is impossible to run trains, so the Japanese simply converted it into a highway for cars. (2) The electricity and water supply have been repaired by engineers sent by the Japanese, but without huge capital to replace the machines, they cannot be used. (3) Within three months of Shantou's fall, not a single cargo or passenger has been imported, and industry and commerce have come to a standstill, turning it into a dead city. Those who have not fled are limited to buying two jiao worth of white rice (not enough for one catty) per person per day. Nearby villages also lack rice, and some walk, take boats, and travel twenty to thirty li to Shantou to buy rice, only able to buy a little to prolong their lives. The prosperity of the Shantou market is only found in the gambling houses and stalls in the alleys and the large hotels and restaurants occupied as brothels and opium dens. Pushing it to Zhi Ping Road, Sheng Ping Road, Ju Ping Road, and Zhen Ping Road, the faces of all the shops and silver houses have completely changed, with gambling houses every five steps and opium dens every ten steps.

### Salt City Repeatedly Bombed

With the Communication, at 10:30 a.m. on the 22nd, two Japanese seaplanes and one bomber circled over Yancheng for seven or eight weeks, dropping one incendiary bomb, which landed in the city and set several houses on fire. They then strafed with machine guns before retreating after forty minutes. At 8:40 a.m. on the 23rd, two Japanese planes took off from Sheyang Lake and circled over Yancheng for reconnaissance. Soon after, four more planes came, divided into three groups, and strafed with machine guns for fifty minutes. Later, three more planes came from Dongtai and dropped nine bombs, all of which landed in the villages and towns near the city, causing minimal damage.

On September 21, they submitted an application to the education department of the association for recordation.

### Fujian Province: Raising Teachers' Salaries

(Fuzhou Correspondence) In Fujian Province, the salaries of primary and secondary school teachers have always been meager. Since the reduction of educational funds began two years ago, the amount has become even lower, leading many excellent teachers to resign due to financial difficulties, creating instability in education. To improve wartime education efficiency, the provincial government has specifically enacted and implemented a method for determining the salaries of principals, teachers, and staff in secondary schools. According to this method, the minimum monthly salary for a high school principal is 150 yuan, and the maximum is 260 yuan, with nine salary grades. Salaries increase by 10 yuan per grade below 200 yuan and by 20 yuan per grade above 200 yuan. The minimum monthly salary for a high school teacher is 100 yuan, and the maximum is 180 yuan, with nine salary grades, increasing by 10 yuan per grade. The minimum monthly salary for a clerk is 20 yuan, and the maximum is 60 yuan, with nine salary grades, increasing by 5 yuan per grade. The minimum monthly salary for a junior high school principal is 120 yuan, and the maximum is 200 yuan, with nine salary grades, increasing by 10 yuan per grade. The minimum monthly salary for a junior high school teacher is 80 yuan, and the maximum is 180 yuan, with nine salary grades, increasing by 10 yuan per grade. The salary for clerks is the same as in high schools. Regulations for establishing salary standards for teachers and staff have also been stipulated. For the 28th year of the Republic (1939), the average number of classes in each provincial secondary school should be used as the basis for calculating salaries. The average monthly salary for principals of senior high schools, normal schools, and senior vocational schools is 200 yuan per person. The average monthly salary for full-time teachers is 140 yuan per person. The average monthly salary for principals of junior high schools, simplified normal schools, and junior vocational schools is 170 yuan per person. The average monthly salary for full-time teachers is 120 yuan per person. The average monthly salary for clerks is 40 yuan per person. The total monthly increase in funding is 80 yuan. From August to December, the total increase in funding is 40,000 yuan, allocated from the provincial treasury. The salaries of primary school teachers in various counties and districts are even lower, far below the monthly salaries of the lowest-ranking civil servants in administrative organs, with most earning between 12 and 15 yuan per month. The Education Department, under Liu, has previously established rules for the appointment, service, and rewards and punishments of primary school teachers and staff in various counties and districts. However, most counties and districts have been unable to implement them due to financial difficulties, resulting in most excellent primary school teachers changing careers, and current teachers being unable to serve with peace of mind. Relief measures are urgently needed. The current temporary provincial assembly also believes that it is necessary to increase funding for primary education in various counties and districts and that the salaries of primary school teachers should be raised. The Education Department is actively handling the registration and assessment of primary school teachers throughout the province, which will be completed soon. In the future, all qualified personnel, whether newly employed or currently serving, should receive a minimum monthly salary of 20 yuan. Those already serving should receive a minimum of 24 yuan. Counties and districts where primary school teachers' monthly salaries do not meet these standards should raise funds to reach these standards. Those that have already reached these standards should still find ways to raise them further to promote the development of local education. (August 9)

### The Municipal Council Subsidizes Chinese Private Schools; The Third Tranche of Educational Funds to be Issued Next Month

In view of the increase in the number of Chinese schools in the Public Concession after the war, and the fact that most schools are experiencing a shortage of educational funds and are unable to maintain operations, the Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council is increasing its funding for Chinese private schools this year from 160,000 yuan to 220,000 yuan, to support the continued promotion of Chinese education. The funds will be distributed in four tranches. The first and second tranches have already been distributed to the approved schools. It is now known that the third tranche of subsidies, totaling over 50,000 yuan, will be issued next month.

### Finance; British and American Exchange Rates Hover with a Relaxed Tone

Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, the HSBC posted rates without any change. In the unofficial market for British and American exchange rates, the exchange rate of US dollars against British pounds rose by 6.25 points during the holiday, returning to the 4 yuan level. Therefore, the domestic market opened with a weaker tone for American dollars and a stable tone for British pounds. British pounds were at 4/28123, and American dollars were at 7.125 yuan. Money changers first bought in, and American banks were more willing to supply. After the opening, Sassoon, a British company, bought in, causing the rate to stabilize. British banks continued to release profits, and Hong Kong Electric also sold (to invest in gold). Subsequently, due to frequent sell orders from overseas, Hong Kong, and other regions, coupled with the fact that Chinese speculators were approaching the end of the month settlement period and the swap rates for September and October were high, they also began to close positions, leading to a weakening tone. British pounds were difficult to sell at 4/34375, and American dollars were at 7.28125 yuan. The downward trend stopped at noon and became stable. In the afternoon, the supply from British and American banks was very good, briefly strengthening the rates before returning to stable levels. As a result, British pounds closed at 4/3125, and American dollars closed at 7.21875 yuan, with British pounds slightly weaker by 0.03125 compared to before the holiday, and American dollars stronger by 0.125. The futures for this month were the same as the spot rates, but the futures for October for British pounds were also similar to the spot rates. However, because speculators generally adopted a buying attitude towards US dollars since the outbreak of the European war, and because the September settlement was approaching, those who did not have the financial strength to take delivery were unwilling to sell, so they had to swap, resulting in a slightly weaker tone. In the end, it only eased by 0.0625, so the dollar swap spread widened further, already reaching 1.875 points at the closing, with the combined monthly interest (excluding commissions) increasing to over 2.6%. It was reported that foreign banks were even willing to offer US$1.5625, but most wealthy merchants believed that interest rates would continue to rise, so few took the offer that day. Trading volume for spot and futures was robust in the morning and declined in the afternoon.

Sassoon Selling from Hong Kong

At the beginning of the morning, London's large orders were stable for both near and far terms. Silver prices in New York collectively contracted by 2 points. The price of raw gold in London was not fixed. The exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai, and France were all stable. US dollars against British pounds rose by 6.25 points, Shanghai rose by 1 jiao, and France rose by 1 fen. The above were all rolled over from before the holiday. The central bank's posted exchange rates remained the same. At the opening of the morning, the selling price of spot goods at banks was 4/28125 for British pounds and 7.125 for American dollars, which was stable for British pounds and 0.03125 weaker for American dollars compared to Monday, due to the increase in the exchange rate. Although Chinese money changers bought in after the opening, foreign banks, such as a certain favorable bank in North China, were quite willing to sell, so the market situation was extremely stable. It is estimated that a certain favorable bank in North China sold spot American dollars to Chinese money changers for 7.125 and 1875. HSBC's posted exchange rates were announced as unchanged, and the announcement of the silver balance tax also showed no increase or decrease. Afterwards, the Western company Sassoon slightly bought in, but foreign banks still had the willingness to supply, so it was not affected. It is estimated that Sassoon settled spot British pounds from foreign banks such as the Netherlands, North China, and Favorable for 4/3125, and spot American dollars for 7.1875 and 125. Then, the Chinese cotton yarn group suddenly liquidated the _ _ month American dollars, and the foreign electric Hong Kong also sold out, so the situation became slightly stronger. It is estimated that the cotton yarn group sold the _ _ month American dollars to Datong for 7.21875 and 25. Following this, Hong Kong Electric sold spot British pounds to a certain favorable bank in North China and other foreign banks for 4/3125 and 34375, and spot American dollars for 7.25 and 28125. Extending to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was 4/3125 for British pounds and 7.21875 for American dollars, which was 0.03125 weaker for British pounds and 0.09375 stronger for American dollars compared to the morning opening.

The American Dollar Swap Spread Widens Further

The market state in the later market was extremely quiet, and the trend was still slightly strong. It was heard that a certain favorable bank would sell spot American dollars to the same bank for 7.21875 and 25, and spot British pounds for 4/3125 and 328125. Extending to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price was 4/3125 for British pounds and 7.21875 for American dollars, the same as this month. October British pounds were 4/265625, and American dollars were 7.03125. As a result, compared to before the holiday, both spot and monthly British pounds were 0.03125 weaker, and American dollars were all 0.125 stronger. October British pounds were also 0.03125 cheaper, while American dollars were 0.0625 higher.

### Gold Price and Exchange Rate Diverge; Hong Kong Group Forcefully Buys Gold; Transactions Total 3,000 Taels

Yesterday, in the unofficial market for cash gold bars, although the exchange rate was stable and slightly strengthened, the gold price rose divergently. However, the fluctuation range that day was not as strong as before the holiday. It was said that a certain gold store sold at high prices (reportedly to convert to foreign exchange), and the Hong Kong group took advantage of the low prices to forcefully buy (because the gold price in Hong Kong was about 400 yuan higher than the gold price in Shanghai), purchasing a considerable amount throughout the day. The general trend was slightly weak at the beginning, then stable, and then hovered. After the low price of 4,095 yuan at the opening in the morning, the price was pushed up to a peak of 4,147 yuan at noon by a certain money changer on behalf of the Hong Kong group. After the opening in the afternoon, a certain cash store forcefully sold, pushing the price down slightly to 4,110 yuan. Later, the Hong Kong group pulled the price up to 4,145 yuan. After entering, a certain gold store pushed the price down again to 4,115 yuan. However, the price ultimately closed at 4,123 yuan, an increase of 18 yuan compared to before the holiday.

The price of silver jewelry in jewelry stores was raised by 5 yuan. The price of customs gold remained fixed and unchanged.

Hired Gold Rises Very Little

Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (10 taels), the market seemed slightly weaker due to the heard that the exchange rate was slightly stronger. The market opened 10 yuan lower than the closing price on Monday. A certain gold store sold 50 taels to a money changer for 4,095 yuan. After the opening, the Hong Kong group's buying intentions were strong, and a certain money changer was entrusted to buy forcefully. Another money changer and a certain cash store also bought on behalf of customers. The market immediately turned prosperous, and the price soon rose by 50 yuan. A money changer bought 30 taels for the jewelry store group for 4,145 yuan. Then, as the exchange rate weakened, the customer's buying intentions became sluggish, and a certain gold store and jewelry store group eagerly sold, causing the price to fall by 35 yuan. A certain number of taels were sold to a money changer for 4,110 yuan. After this, the securities group suddenly bought forcefully, and money changers also engaged in buying, stopping the downward trend and rising by 37 yuan. Money changers traded 50 taels with each other for 4,147 yuan. Near noon, a certain gold store sold again, and the situation slightly declined, soon falling back by 7 yuan. A certain number of taels were sold by a certain gold store to a money changer for 4,140 yuan, as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the market opened lower by 30 yuan because a certain cash store had a strong selling intention and lacked support. A certain cash store sold 30 taels to a money changer for 4,110 yuan. After the opening, a certain money changer acted on behalf of the Hong Kong group to buy forcefully again. Although a certain cash store still had the intention to sell, their financial strength could not match. The price soon rose back by 35 yuan. A money changer bought 20 taels for the jewelry store group. When the price was 4,145 yuan, a certain gold store suddenly revived the selling trend and tirelessly sold at high prices, causing the price to fall again by 30 yuan. A money changer gave a certain silver number 20 taels, for the sake of hoping for a thousand one hundred and fifteen yuan. Afterwards, a certain money changer came again to pull up the price, and they were raised by eight yuan. The money changer acquired a Yuhao securities group for a total of 50 taels, with 4,123 yuan serving as the night closing price. As a result, before the fake roll rose by 18 yuan, it was heard that a money changer had received fifty taels from a gold store, amounting to 4,128 yuan. The price ranged from fifty-two yuan throughout the day, and the selling price of the gold sign from the cash shop was ten yuan higher than that of Hida, and the revenue had to be reduced by more than thirty yuan, and the current bid gold was still fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and the transaction was fresh.

Ornamental Gold At Four Hundred And Yuan

It is estimated that Daheng Bank still had 420 yuan, and the new banks had the same price as the previous price, and all revenue had to be reduced by about twenty yuan.

### Securities; Domestic Debt Slightly Weak, Foreign Stocks with Strong Buying Interest

Securities unofficial market reopened yesterday after the Autumn Festival holiday. The war in Hunan was intense, and there was no hope for the end of the European war. Market sentiment lacked excitement, and large holders slowly sold out. However, the large part was still being held, so the market price gradually decreased. When the market opened yesterday, the market price was weak due to the congestion of sellers. Later, because large holders were also seeking to sell, Grade C broke the 5 yuan mark, and Grade D and E also broke the 4 yuan mark. No. 38 always sold out, and Xingyuan, Yongkang, and Dafeng all sold a considerable amount. The only buyers were Hongkang and Lianhe who had a slight appetite, and Yizhong also bought in. As a result, the market price was down by 0.7 to 0.85 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

### Cotton Yarn: Peak Season Approaching its End; Speculators Switching to Purchase of Coarse Yarn; 10-count Yarn Rises by 10 to 20 Yuan; 20-count Yarn Drops by 5 to 6 Yuan

The yarn market is calm, with a trend appearing to be indecisive. Actual transactions are too few, and people's minds are still firm. Because raw cotton is not loose, and factory costs are a factor, they are also unwilling to concede on opening prices. Thus, a stalemate has formed. However, the market situation for 10-count coarse yarn is turning towards higher prices, and transactions have increased in volume. In reality, the value is cheaper than 20-count yarn. Ordinary operators would rather collect coarse yarn than buy fine yarn to speculate on; the risk is lower, and since the season is still in its peak period, the hope of profit is relatively greater. This situation was reported in this newspaper earlier. Therefore, although fine yarn was sluggish today, coarse yarn saw an increase instead. Given this situation, the price difference between 20-count and 10-count yarn can be expected to narrow.

The morning opening for current yarn saw fellow traders gathering, and most were hesitant to move. Because there was no real demand for purchases, progress was slow. By 9:50 AM, the opening price had still not been set. However, there were transactions in 10-count coarse yarn from Tianjin dealers, with a few bales traded at high prices. Then, the single opening price for 20-count Double Horse brand yarn from the warehouse was flat, and the spot price fell instead. The intermediary market was very slight. However, there was still no improvement in sales to customers. Until the market closed, it was still mediocre. It was found that 1,845 bales were traded in half a day. The market price for 20-count Double Horse fell by 5 yuan, Heavenly Maiden fell by 6 yuan, and Double Globe fell by 6 yuan. However, 10-count coarse yarn rose by 10 to 20 yuan. Wing On Factory opened with 700 bales of 10-count Special Golden City brand, priced at 650 yuan, with same-day payment. The amount purchased by each dealer is as follows:

Hong Kong 560 Fellow Traders 905

Inland 360 Ningbo 10

Xiamen 10 Total 1,845

### Native Cotton Factories Turn Stronger

Cotton transactions have made considerable progress. Chinese factories such as Shenxin, Wing On, and De Feng have been actively purchasing, leading to prosperity. Therefore, the market price is unusually firm and has an upward trend. In reality, various sources are difficult to secure. According to letters from the four rural districts, the price of seed cotton in the countryside has also increased. Recently, the price of 10-count coarse yarn has been high, and factories have been replenishing their raw materials in greater quantities. Therefore, the demand for Indian cotton has also increased. The sources from Northern Jiangsu include 1,065 bales of Tongzhou cotton and 825 bales of grass-packed cotton, arriving over two days. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.

In other news, the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been more sluggish in recent days. However, prices have remained very firm. The factory's intention to purchase has been rather weak lately, but fellow traders have not relaxed on sales prices. Fellow traders generally believe that the market's inventory is drying up day by day, so those with more financial leeway not only do not want to sell but also seize the opportunity to buy and store. Therefore, most believe that trading may become more prosperous in early October.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was relatively quiet in the early morning yesterday, primarily because fellow traders had little trading. Spot trading also saw a slight increase and triggered some short covering. The market situation was quite firm. The closing price rose by 7 or 8 points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 2 rupees. The Egyptian cotton market rose by more than 30 points. Liverpool fell by 9 to 10 points.

### Grain: New Early Rice Appears; Siam Rice Increases by 1 or 2 Yuan

Siam rice: New goods from various places have gradually entered the market recently. For example, new Kunsan glutinous rice has been on the market for almost a week. However, since the amount arriving is small, the glutinous rice market has not only been unaffected but has become expensive due to shortages. Amidst the rising prices of broken glutinous rice yesterday, new early rice also appeared on the market, with 60 bags of Fengjing Hundred Brother rice arriving. Moreover, since the weather has been favorable this year, the quality of the rice is very good, so it is very popular with stores, with the price opening at 4 yuan per bag. As for other glutinous rice, it is said that there are more than 30 ships of Hexia goods en route, but they were later diverted to Pudong and Hongkou districts. Therefore, the amount arriving in this port was only 3,000-odd bags of new goods from various districts such as Suzhou, Kunsan, Fengjing, and Jiaxing, transported by truck. Customer brokers were also shouting high prices, and importers were competing to buy to meet urgent needs, creating a tight situation. The market rose, and the result was an increase of 1 or 2 yuan compared to the pre-holiday closing. The prices in various top markets rose accordingly, and the prices in this street and rural villages increased by 2 or 3 cents after a one-day market closure for the Mid-Autumn Festival. At noon, with more goods arriving, Japanese merchants seized the opportunity to launch a large number of Wuhu top-quality rice, causing the market to be filled with chips and forming an oversupply, causing the market to fall back. The closing price of both old and new top-quality rice fell by about half a yuan compared to before the holiday. The trading price of special common broken glutinous rice was 42 yuan, medium was 38 yuan, special tin broken glutinous rice was 41 yuan, high was 40 yuan, medium was 38 yuan, Suzhou, Tong, Kunsan broken glutinous rice was 38 yuan, new glutinous rice was 37 yuan, Hexia old early and late rice was 38 yuan to 30 yuan, original bags were 40 yuan to 38 yuan, Fengjing Hundred Brother was 40 yuan, Suzhou, Kunsan, Fengjia new mutton tip special was 26.5 yuan, general market was 26 yuan, and decisive was 25 yuan, reed tip was 26 yuan to 25 yuan, Jiangbei new tip was 24 yuan, and decisive was 23 yuan, Wuhu special tip was 24.5 yuan, market was 24 yuan to 23.5 yuan, and decisive was 22 yuan, old tip was 23 yuan to 22.8 yuan, and the variable price was also better by half a yuan. This glutinous rice was 34-35 yuan, Hong Kong glutinous rice was 34 yuan to 33.5 yuan. The number of transactions totaled more than 8,000 bags.

Customer Indica: The morning market was affected by the soaring glutinous rice market, and the market once became popular. However, with the continuous arrival of goods, and Japanese merchants continuing to launch batches of 3,000 to 4,000 bags, the market immediately went downstream. The result was a slight decrease of 4 or 5 cents compared to before the holiday. High customer Indica opened at around 24 yuan, and medium decisive was 23-22 yuan. The number of transactions in the general market was 5,000 bags.

### Battleship Flour Market is Lively and Prosperous; Cannon Brand Increases by One Dime

Yesterday's flour trading was still active. Because it was the opening of the market after the Mid-Autumn Festival, sales to customers were slightly more lively than before. Battleship flour was the most popular. In addition to the North China merchants adding to their purchases, the needs of this street and the inland were also not quiet. Moreover, exports of other miscellaneous brands of flour to Hong Kong and Xiamen have been quite a bit recently. The market was originally tight, but currently, each factory has ample flour in stock, and many hoarders are seeking to sell. Therefore, the factory price is 7 yuan for the original price, and the returned goods are still 7 yuan and 5 cents to 7 yuan, 1 dime and 4-5 cents. It is said that Battleship, Pi Jiao, and Cannon brands have increased by about 1 dime. Today, there were 54,100 bags of exported flour transported to Tianjin, and 4,000 bags transported to Hong Kong. The sources of wheat yesterday and today are still continuous. The goods arriving are still mostly wheat from Jing, Wu, Chang, and Xi. Each factory is not greedy for the need for raw materials because the flour in stock is sufficient. The cargo side is not willing to concede too much because the production price is not loose. As a result, there was not much honor or disgrace. The factory took more than 10,000 bags in the general market, and hoarders pulled in 7 or 8 carts. The highest price of wheat in the management store was 10 yuan, 2 dimes, and 3 cents, slightly tighter than before. The price of each wheat sold to the factory was similar to the previous opening.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Price Recovers

This No. 1 crystal sugar was slightly loose, dropping by half a yuan to 67 yuan, and Jing Ming crystal sugar was 68.5 yuan. National sugar had little movement due to the small number of sales and still lacked transactions.

It was found that sugar goods arriving in Shanghai, previously (on the 26th), came from Hong Kong in 346 bags, on the 28th came from Beihai in 320 bags, and also came from Hong Kong in 800 bags.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Sales Turn Active; Selling Price Rises Again by More than a Yuan; Many Soybeans Exported

Yesterday, because the Mid-Autumn Festival had passed, soybean oil sales in this street turned active. The inland also made inquiries, causing the market atmosphere to continue to be tense amidst optimistic views. The market price rose again by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan compared to before the holiday. A total of 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were opened for trading throughout the day, priced at 44 yuan. Qingqi oil was 200 pieces, priced at 44.5 yuan to 45 yuan.

### Piece Goods: This Street Actively Handles National Cloth; Qingdao Fine Cloth Has No More Arrivals; Cloth Country

Yesterday, the cloth market was firm and high, which was due to the increased price of East Piece Goods market. For dyeing purposes, this street switched to handling national cloth, so this street's purchases were the strongest. More than 1,000 packages of fine cloth and fine twill were traded, and the selling price increased by 2 dimes and a half to 5 dimes per piece. The morning market for coarse cloth was flat, and the later market increased by 2 dimes per piece. However, coarse twill was the least lively due to sluggish actual sales. Customer routes, such as Sichuan and Yunnan merchants, stopped handling goods because of the obstructed Yunnan-Vietnam traffic. The sales of colored cloth and broadcloth were quite affected, and the market has turned stable, not as popular as white goods. Hoarders in this street were very enthusiastic about hoarding light-colored goods, such as pongee, striped bleached cloth, bleached cloth, fine yarn thread, and greige cloth, because fine yarn money was expensive.

White goods: Yesterday, because the dyeing industry in this street and the Tianjin merchants continued to have good demand, the market situation was active. The forwarders opened with 22 yuan and 5 dimes for next month's brand-name fine twill, 22 yuan for Baby brand, more than 200 packages, and 24 yuan for brand-name fine cloth, more than 100 packages. The market transaction was quite strong, reaching 800-odd pieces. The spot market price increased by a dime to 5 dimes per piece. Qingdao fine cloth has no more arrivals because the price at the place of origin is expensive, and the amount in stock in the Shanghai market is gradually running out.

There were 348 pieces of exported piece goods transported to Hong Kong, 3 pieces transported to Penang, and 30 pieces transported to Singapore on the 29th.

### Hardware: Flat Iron is Expensive

The flat iron market situation has been silent for a long time. Sales to customer merchants are sluggish, and purchases in this street are also sporadic. However, there is not much stock, and the places of origin for these goods are the UK, Belgium, and Germany. Because they are busy with the war, they have no time to transport goods, so overseas sources have been cut off. The asking price in this port is increasing day by day. Currently, the market price for 2-inch flat iron is 40 yuan per picul, 3-inch is 38 yuan, and the asking price for 4-inch is around 37 yuan. It has been found that it has increased by more than 10 yuan compared to before.

### North-South Goods: Southern Gorgon Fruit Will Soon See New Goods; Old Pond Gorgon Fruit is Firm

Southern pond gorgon fruit: The harvest this year is still poor. It has been heard that new goods have been seen in the production area, and the handling price is as high as 150 yuan. The large ones will soon arrive in Shanghai.

Old pond gorgon fruit is firm, currently selling for 80 yuan. It has been heard that the new red gorgon fruit is also poor. When the time comes, the market price will inevitably rise accordingly.

### Central Bank: Fractional Currency Notes Issued Today; Entrusting Tobacco and Exchange Industry to Distribute; No Separate Counter Set Up; Can Be Circulated in the Market from Noon Today

All Temporary Substitute Vouchers Should Be Recalled by the Deadline

The Central Bank, upon the order of the Ministry of Finance, issued one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes, which were contracted to be printed by American Yongning Company. The first batch of 500,000 yuan has been completed. It was originally intended to be issued on August 22, but it was delayed due to the discovery of unstamped, unnumbered samples on the market. The bank, in order to be cautious, temporarily delayed the issue and negotiated with the printer to thoroughly investigate the reasons for the leakage outside. Now it has been clarified that the number of leaked samples outside is not large. In order to relieve the market's need and facilitate the change of each industry, it was decided to publicly announce the issue by the Shanghai branch from today and entrust the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association to distribute and exchange to each of its members. The details are as follows:

Central Bank Publicly Announces Issuance

The Central Bank Shanghai Branch announced, "This bank is now issuing one type of five-cent note, both sides are blue, and one type of one-cent note, both sides are red. Both types have a watermark printed on the front and numbers and stamps printed on the back. It will be put into use immediately, and this bank has entrusted the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association to distribute and exchange to each of its members. This bank will not set up a counter for exchange. This is hereby announced. September 29, 28th year of the Republic of China."

Entrusting Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association for Exchange

The first batch of fractional currency notes, totaling 300,000 yuan in one-cent notes and 200,000 yuan in five-cent notes, will be issued by the Central Bank Shanghai Branch. The bank's Issuance Bureau has negotiated with the Shanghai Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association, and it has been entrusted to the association to distribute and exchange to each tobacco and exchange store. The bank has decided not to set up a separate exchange counter. It is hoped that each industry will not go to the bank for exchange. As for the exchange of each bank and money shop, they can obtain the exchange from the bank through the Mountain Bank and the Money Industry Preparatory Association's treasury.

Inviting Fellow Traders to Prepare Funds for Exchange

Yesterday, the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association sent market committee members Zhang Shibin and Shen Shihe with a letter to the Central Bank to discuss collecting fractional currency notes. The letter is recorded as follows, "Respectfully informing that last month we received a letter in which our fellow traders pre-ordered fractional currency notes. This afternoon, we received a phone notification from your bank that the fractional currency notes are about to be issued and that our fellow traders should prepare funds for exchange. We have already summoned our fellow traders to pay and exchange with your bank. We have now gathered the funds and hereby send a letter and personnel to negotiate in person. It is hoped that the fractional currency notes will be handed over to the original person for transfer." Yesterday, 94 members prepared funds totaling 34,700 yuan to exchange for fractional currency notes from the Central Bank.

Full Reserve and Exchange Method

Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice Society learned from the Central Bank that the reserve for the fractional currency notes is a 100% reserve in legal tender. Anyone holding 20 five-cent fractional currency notes or 100 one-cent fractional currency notes can exchange them for one yuan of legal tender from the bank's Issuance Bureau. The first batch of 500,000 yuan will be issued and circulated in the Shanghai market. In the future, it will continue to be printed according to market needs. The Central Bank Shanghai Branch has reported the scheduled issue and the entrustment to the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association to the Chongqing headquarters and sent the fractional currency note design to the headquarters for submission to the Ministry of Finance for record.

Issued This Morning and Circulated in Shanghai

The 500,000 yuan of fractional currency notes was printed by American Yongning Company and was delivered in full to the Central Bank Shanghai Branch last night in accordance with the printing contract. The bank's Issuance Bureau sent personnel to count and prepare to issue them at 9:00 AM today and negotiated with Zhang Shibin and others from the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association's market committee, and it was decided that they will go to collect them at 10:00 AM this morning. From 11:00 AM today, the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association will distribute them to each member, and they can be circulated in the market from noon.

Temporary Substitute Vouchers of Each Industry Should Be Recalled

In order to cope with the lack of small change and solve the difficulty of giving change, each industry in this city, in addition to using postage stamps and revenue stamps, has mostly issued its own substitute vouchers for circulation. Due to the forgery and misuse by unscrupulous people, the credibility of substitute vouchers has been lost, and disputes arise from time to time when they are used. Now that the Central Bank's Shanghai Branch has been ordered to formally issue fractional currency notes, substitute vouchers, which were originally a temporary expedient, should be publicly announced to be recalled by the deadline in order to strengthen the national monetary system. As for the temporary fractional currency notes issued by the tram companies and public bus companies in the two concessions, they should all be recalled in accordance with the deadline.

### Japanese and Puppet Troops Near Nicheng Heavily Threatened; Gu's Troops Intercept and Ambush; Large Group of Japanese Troops Withdraw

The troops under Gu Lifeng, the captain of the Special Task Force of the Fourth Detachment of the Patriotic National Salvation Army in Pudong, are mostly members of the merchant corps and young people who have received considerable training. Since the Japanese and puppet troops occupied Datuan, Gu's troops have been scattered in the countryside, using mobile strategies to continue fighting consistently. For example, in the Nicheng area near the sea,

More than a Thousand Japanese and Puppet Troops

Tried to carry out search operations, but were repeatedly intercepted and ambushed by Gu's troops in the late night. When the Japanese and puppet troops pursued, Gu's troops had dispersed, and the surrounding area was mostly vast fields of reeds, with no trace left. The Japanese and puppet troops indiscriminately fired into the reeds, and even after carefully searching the reeds during the day, they found nothing. After three consecutive days, the Japanese and puppet troops could not bear the threat,

And Returned to Datuan

Suddenly, on the night of the 25th, the Japanese and puppet troops split into five teams and advanced towards Nicheng and Pengzhen on the left side of the area, and Xinzhen on the right side. Unexpectedly, their movements were detected by Gu's troops, who urgently sent troops to ambush in the essential roads near Chenjiadian (still eight li away from Xinzhen). When a part of the Japanese and puppet troops, more than 200 people, passed by, they immediately surrounded and ambushed them on all sides. The sound of machine guns and rifles was as dense as connected beads. It was at night, and the Japanese and puppet troops did not know how many guerrillas there were, so they quickly

Sent a Signal for Help

By the time the Japanese and puppet troops from the left route arrived, it was already dawn, and Gu's troops had also withdrawn. Although the army searched nearby in the villages within one or two li, they found nothing. It was heard that more than ten Japanese and puppet soldiers were killed or wounded in this battle. Guo Zongqiang, the platoon leader of Gu's troops, was wounded and has now been sent to a safe area for treatment. Four other soldiers were wounded. According to people who came that day, the Japanese and puppet troops were still searching and had not returned to Datuan.

### Japanese and Puppet Troops Control Vegetables; Local Goods Industry Expresses Opposition; If Implemented, the Impact Will Be Great; Will Hold Meeting to Discuss Effective Countermeasures

Regarding the "Municipal Government's" plan to establish a "Shanghai Vegetable Market" at the former site of the Four Banks Warehouse on North Suzhou Road to complete the Japanese side's attempt to control the main food supplies of the two concessions, a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency yesterday inquired about this news from a leader of the local goods industry. According to him, this rumor had been heard a long time ago. However, the registration method and

Detailed Regulations

The local goods industry has not received any oral or written notice from any party. However, it is believed that there must be treacherous people who, out of greed for personal gain, are helping the tyrant to do evil, hoping for its implementation. The local goods industry sent people to inspect the Four Banks Warehouse near the New Garbage Bridge yesterday morning. Besides the Japanese military police and puppet police still stationed at the entrance of the warehouse, there was no sign of

Anything Unusual

People were also sent to inquire about the local goods industry in Hongkou, who also said that they were unaware of this matter. However, if this control is implemented, it will have a great impact on the local goods industry in the concessions. If it is implemented, it will be necessary to hold a meeting to discuss effective countermeasures. The person also said that the current market vegetables are

Not Smoothly Sourced

And the prices are gradually increasing, which has already made it impossible for ordinary people to buy. If they are controlled, it will be even more difficult to bear. It can be asserted. In recent days, when vegetables transported from Pudong to the Laozha Bridge passed through the Second Baidu Bridge, there were often interceptions of vegetable boats, ordering them to be sold to the Hongkou Vegetable Market.

### Local Products Transshipped from Ningbo to Shanghai Must First Settle Foreign Exchange; Each Industry Submits Request for Relief to the Ministry; Ningbo Goods Transported to Shanghai Will Be Greatly Reduced

The Ningbo Zhejiang Customs received an order from the Ministry of Finance that all local products transshipped from Ningbo to Shanghai, regardless of the type of goods, must first settle foreign exchange, otherwise customs clearance will be refused. Therefore, many goods waiting to be transported from Ningbo to Shanghai are stockpiled and cannot be loaded. Although each industry in Ningbo is currently requesting relief from the Ministry of Finance, until there is an indication of a change in the method, the transport of goods from Ningbo to Shanghai will be greatly reduced.

Shortening the Voyage Also Obstructed

Although the authorities of each passenger and cargo ship intend to reduce cargo transportation as much as possible and carry more passengers, Mou Fushu of the Shipping Department of the Libe and Foreign Firm temporarily returned to Shanghai while the Ningbo goods were not yet unloaded, so that he could carry passengers and restart to Zhenhai. In this way, passengers urgently waiting to return to Ningbo could board earlier, and the shipping company could save the unnecessary time spent lingering outside the Zhenhai Estuary. However, it did not materialize due to some reason and decided to return to Shanghai after unloading the goods in Zhenhai. The original plan to open Zhenhai on October 1 has been canceled.

The First Shipping Vessel to Depart from Shanghai to Ningbo

The De Ping, a ship of Zhongyi Company, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The ship was originally scheduled to depart from Zhenhai at 4:00 PM on the 29th. However, due to Mou Fushu's postponement of the return to Shanghai, the goods waiting to be loaded on the ship increased, and loading took time. Therefore, the ship has been postponed to set sail for Zhenhai at 4:00 PM on the 30th. After that, the first ship to return to Shanghai from Zhenhai will be Haifu.

### Second Price-Stabilized Rice Sale Decided to Be Postponed; Meeting to Be Held Regularly with Various Groups to Conclude First Price-Stabilized Rice Sale

The Shanghai Rice Industry Association has decided to organize the sale of 8,000 bags of tribute rice for each group, and the two concessions have a total of five locations, which were all completed on the 25th of this month. The full handover has been completed. The rice industry association held the 16th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the meeting place on Shanhai Guan Road at 3:00 PM yesterday, and Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, Qu Zhenhua, Pan Jibin, Shi Hongxun, Huang Ruyuan, Xia Tongfu, Chen Shaolian, Wan Peiyuan, Chen Liangqi, Jiang Qiusheng and other more than 20 people attended. Chairman Zhang Nianxuan, first the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting and the status of the association affairs, and then the directors of each price-stabilized rice sale location separately reported on the price-stabilized rice sale process, and then the chairman reported on the price-stabilized rice sale handover, and proposed to send letters to the relevant groups and schedule joint meetings to conclude the price-stabilized rice sale matters, all of which were unanimously approved. Also, regarding the second price-stabilized rice sale, yesterday the chairman of the Rice Industry Association committee, Zhang Nianxuan, told a reporter from the New Voice Society that after repeated consultations, it was decided to postpone the event temporarily, because the national rice from various places has already entered the market and will be transported here continuously. At that time, the Shanghai rice price will fall, so the price stabilization is no longer needed.

### Puppet Police Still Stationed Inside City Chamber of Commerce

Since the British defense forces expelled the puppet police stationed inside the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce in Tianhou Palace on North Henan Road, the site was guarded by puppet detectives yesterday morning. By the afternoon, it was guarded by armed puppet police again. When a reporter from Da Guang News Agency went to inspect, they saw a puppet policeman inside the guard pavilion on the side door of the Tianhou Palace, and a puppet policeman idling in front of the guard room at the north end of the City Chamber of Commerce. A plainclothes puppet detective was standing outside the gate of the Chamber of Commerce.

### New Property Tax Rate for the Public Concession

The Public Works Department recently issued a notice stating that the property tax for the winter of this year should be paid on October 1. In accordance with the resolution of the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in the previous session, from October 1 of this year, the property tax rate within the concession will be changed to 18%, and the property tax rate in the road area outside the concession will be changed to 16%. Also, the property tax for Western-style houses will not be collected by separate personnel. After receiving the tax bill, each household should go directly to the tax division at No. 209 Jiangxi Road to pay.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Xinghua

Hua Dong News Agency reported that according to a private source in the financial community who received a telegram from Xinghua, Northern Jiangsu, Japanese planes flew to Xinghua City again on the morning of the 26th and bombed the seat of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Government had already moved to another place, so most of those bombed were innocent civilians, and the losses are being investigated.

### Shanghai Industries Again Request Authorities to Find Ways to Suppress Rice Prices; Restore Rice Stock Survey Work in Shanghai; Negotiate with Japanese to Dredge Rice Sources

Hua Wen News Agency reported that due to the supply of foreign rice and the arrival of new domestic rice, the serious problem of food for the people in this city seems to be gradually resolved. However, the rice price has not yet recovered to the standard level, so all parties are still suppressing the food problem. According to news from the bean and rice industry association, the foreign indica rice is still between 25 and 26 yuan per dan recently, and the Changxi high japonica rice is still as high as 40 yuan per dan. Now that the new rice is on the market and foreign rice is increasing, if no measures are taken to suppress the rice price, the rice price will be unimaginably high when the end of the year arrives. Now the Yusheng factories and Yongfeng printing industry and various industry groups in this city have jointly written to the Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association and the bean and rice industry association, requesting that the weekly survey and public announcement method of rice stocks in this city be restored as before, and at the same time, requesting the concession authorities to actively negotiate with the Japanese to dredge the sources of rice, and strive to suppress the rice price to below the standard in the near future to maintain livelihoods and reassure the people.

### U.S. Yangtze River Patrol Gunboat Guam Sailed to Wuhu Yesterday; U.S. Giant Ship Agassiz Will Arrive in Port; More U.S. Ships Will Be Transferred to Shanghai for Defense in the Next Few Months

The U.S. Yangtze River Fleet's light cruiser Guam, which has been stationed in Shanghai for a long time, left Shanghai at 10:00 AM yesterday to patrol the river defenses, temporarily making Wuhu its final destination. According to U.S. naval sources, the Yangtze River Fleet will make Wuhu its final destination in the future so that it can quickly sail to Shanghai to strengthen its defenses if the situation in Shanghai changes. It is also learned that the U.S. giant ship Agassiz will sail to Shanghai from Manila to increase its defense strength. The U.S. naval authorities in this port received a telegram from the ship on the 26th that it could arrive here as early as today. According to reporters, the U.S. naval authorities will continue to send fleets to Shanghai to increase its defense in the next few months.

According to the French Shanghai Daily on the 28th, the French Community Relief for Wounded Soldiers in Shanghai held its inaugural meeting yesterday at the French Municipal Council Hall on Avenue Dubail, under the chairmanship of Madame Cosme, the French Ambassador's wife. It was reported that at the meeting, Madame Cosme and Madame Padoux, the lawyer's wife, spoke successively, outlining the association's three objectives: (1) to organize training classes for nurses' aides; (2) to solicit donations to assist impoverished Shanghai army and navy personnel and mobilized expatriates; and (3) to transport donations and goods to French wounded soldiers and refugees.

### Puppet Police Invade Western Shanghai with the Aim of Forcibly Collecting Taxes; Residents Uphold Justice and Firmly Refuse; Municipal Council Is Considering Solutions

The infringement of rights by the puppet "Municipal Government" in the extra-settlement road areas of Western Shanghai has recently intensified. It is reported that residents in these areas have been notified that they must pay taxes to the puppet "Municipal Government" starting next quarter. A reporter inquired about this matter yesterday with an official of the Shanghai Municipal Council, who stated that the puppet "Municipal Government's" demand for collecting property taxes in the extra-settlement areas was a new development as far as he was aware. He mentioned that before the August 13th incident, the Finance Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government had made this request, but the Municipal Council had not agreed. The Municipal Council is still paying close attention to the situation in the extra-settlement areas. Although the current situation may not fully satisfy the residents, all the council members are doing their best to find a way to stabilize the situation.

Puppet Police Collect Taxes, Residents Refuse

Since the Japanese and puppet sides are actively seeking to establish economic control in the extra-settlement road area of Western Shanghai, the "Dadao Municipal Government Finance Bureau" has been exerting pressure to collect property taxes in the streets and lanes of the area. Yesterday morning, around 11:00 AM, the "Dadao Finance Bureau" sent a puppet "police" officer named Wang Bin, riding a bicycle, to the Dehe Lane area on Avenue Petain to collect property taxes. When he arrived at No. 15, he was met with opposition from over twenty residents. At the same time, the "police" officer's bicycle suddenly disappeared, leading the residents to be suspected of causing trouble. The puppet "police" officer reported this to the puppet "police" substation on Avenue Petain, which dispatched officers to investigate. As a result, a man named Lü Daoxuan was taken away by the "police" and had not been released by nightfall.

Puppet Side Notifies Tax Collection

The English-language China Press reported, "The 'Dadao' authorities are exerting pressure in the Western Shanghai badlands, and are now going further by demanding taxes for the next quarter from residents in the lanes off the Settlement roads." The English-language China Press received a letter today (the 28th) from a regular resident in the area, describing the difficult situation faced by the residents and expressing concern that they may now have to pay two sets of taxes.

Municipal Council Considers Solutions

Inquiries made with the Municipal Council this morning revealed that the Council was also hearing about the "Municipal Government's" tax demands for the first time. Before the war, the former Municipal Government Tax Bureau, responsible for areas outside the Settlement, had made similar requests. According to a Municipal Council spokesperson this morning, the Council is constantly paying attention to the issue of roads outside the Settlement. The current situation in the area may not fully satisfy the residents, but the Municipal Council members are doing their best to find a solution.

Residents in the Western District Face Hardship

The letter received by the English-language China Press stated that the thousands of residents in the western district abandoned by the Municipal Council are facing extreme difficulties. The "New Municipal Government Tax Bureau" recently notified residents in the area that taxes for the next quarter must be paid to the bureau. If residents refuse to pay taxes to the Dadao authorities, their houses will be cut off and sealed, while Settlement authorities stand by and watch. If they refuse to pay taxes to the Municipal Council, their water and electricity will be cut off. If they pay taxes to both sides, residents will inevitably have to tighten their belts and reduce expenses. Currently, the Dadao authorities do not allow residents in the area to move, so the only solution seems to be for residents to escape alone in the middle of the night.

People are Moving to Avoid the Trouble

Since the incident of the puppet police detaining American sailors on Yu Yuan Road, the police have been sending additional detectives to patrol the road daily, making the situation more tense than elsewhere. After Japanese military police went to Zhaofeng Village (near Zhaofeng Park) to investigate household registrations and notify residents that rent would be collected starting October 1st, most of the third-party tenants have been moving out, creating a scene of empty buildings, except for some second-landlords who are unwilling to give up the large transfer fees they have paid and are temporarily adopting a wait-and-see approach. All day yesterday, busy scenes of people moving boxes and furniture could be seen everywhere on Yu Yuan Road. Starting yesterday, armed Japanese military police in groups of two have been patrolling the area, and the number of puppet police stationed in front of the Toyota textile factory employee dormitory at No. 1249 has also increased from four to six.

Puppet Government's Economy in Dire Straits

The so-called "Municipal Government" is currently experiencing hidden worries and panic regarding its finances. This situation arose because the "Reformed Government Ministry of Finance" suddenly stopped its monthly subsidy of 450,000 yuan at the end of August. The "Municipal Government's" budget requires monthly expenditures of 800,000 yuan, and now more than half of the funding has suddenly disappeared. The August salaries, which were supposed to be paid at the end of August, were barely scraped together by the "Municipal Government" itself. The September salaries, which will be paid at the end of September, have only half of the amount secured, while the other half, originally listed under the "Reformed Government" subsidy, has vanished. In desperation, Chuan Xiaoan will propose paying only half salaries temporarily at the end of this month. The "Municipal Government" originally could collect 600,000 yuan in exorbitant "taxes" each month, but since the "consumption tax" was forcibly canceled by the "Reformed Government" in February of this year, monthly revenue has decreased to 200,000 yuan. Even with the "Reformed Government" subsidy, the total was only over 600,000 yuan. Subsequently, the "property tax," "vehicle tax," "boat tax," and "business tax" were reinstated, increasing monthly revenue to 800,000 yuan, sometimes nearly one million yuan. Now, the "Reformed Government" has suddenly canceled the subsidy, citing an empty treasury, delivering a fatal blow to the "Municipal Government's" economic lifeline. Therefore, the "Mayor and Bureau Chiefs" are planning to levy new "taxes" to try to make up the shortfall.

Puppet Police Stationed Near the Settlement

The locations where puppet police are stationed are gradually extending towards the Settlement. Avenue du President Foch still ends at Avenue Paulins, but Avenue Amherest now reaches Avenue Haig. Starting yesterday, four puppet police officers were stationed at the intersection of Avenue du Haig and Rue Massenet, and a squad of puppet police officers patrolled back and forth with Mauser rifles. The puppet police stationed near the Fa Hua Bridge have recently been stopping and questioning pedestrians, causing unease among nearby residents.

Construction Projects Completed Everywhere

The defensive works constructed by the Japanese and puppet forces at (1) the front gate of No. 11 Avenue Haig, (2) in front of the Japanese military police Western District Command and puppet police substation at the intersection of Route Kaufmann, (3) the front gate of No. 1760 Jing An Si Road, and (4) in front of the Lin family mansion at No. 448 Avenue Haig have all been completed after several revisions. Watchtowers have been added at each entrance and exit, and wooden sunshades have been built on top of the fortifications for nighttime watch and rain shelter.

Security in Western Shanghai Becomes More Chaotic

In the Caojiadu area of the extra-settlement road in Western Shanghai, gambling dens and opium dens are being established under the guise of "clubs," "companies," "conversation rooms," and "ticket houses," with the support of the Japanese and puppet forces, almost every five steps a den, every ten steps a room, becoming a breeding ground for sin and confusion. Since the puppet police encroached on the area, order has become even more chaotic. Lately, plainclothes "criminals" carrying sharp weapons, falsely claiming to be "searching for targets," have been specializing in roadside robberies, happening several times a day. The Japanese military and puppet police have never interfered with this "new order."

Still Quiet in Zhaofeng Village

The "Dadao Police" in the extra-settlement road area of Western Shanghai are still frequently marching in formation on various roads. A reporter made a special trip yesterday to inspect the extra-settlement road area of Western Shanghai and found "Dadao Police" stationed at the intersections of Avenue Amherest and Rue Massenet, Yu Yuan Road and Avenue du President Foch, and Avenue Haig and Avenue Petain, sharing space with Settlement police. Residents in Zhaofeng Village are still living as usual. The majority of the residents in the dozens of houses are businessmen.

### Municipal Council Member Funatsu Resigns

Funatsu, the Japanese member of the Finance Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has resigned due to his departure from Shanghai to return to Japan. His resignation has been approved, and the Council expressed its gratitude for his contributions.

### Meat Industry Dispute in the French Concession: Butchers Breach Contract; Municipal Council Mediates Again; Handled According to Previous Agreement

After the French Municipal Council's Political Affairs Department convened both parties to resolve the dispute between the fresh meat industry and the butchering industry in the French Concession, the butchers suddenly announced on the evening of the 26th that pigs would only be butchered after butchering fees were paid for and tickets were purchased, setting the price at 90 cents per ticket. The meat industry considered this a clear breach of contract and requested the French Municipal Council to mediate again on the 27th. Since representatives from both sides could not be present that day, the meeting was rescheduled for 10:00 AM yesterday, gathering representatives from both sides at the Political Affairs Department of the French Municipal Council. The Political Affairs Department considered this a clear breach of contract by the butchering industry and ordered the cancellation of the advance payment and ticket purchase method, and that the price should not be arbitrarily set at 90 cents, but should be handled according to the previously agreed method, with an increase of 40 cents per pig. Regarding the bookkeeping and cash payment of the butchering fees, they instructed individual arrangements with each meat shop. Furthermore, since the French Concession Butchering Industry Association had not registered with the French Municipal Council, they should complete the registration procedures as soon as possible before being allowed to exist. In addition, the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou used to divide piglets into four grades and mark the grade on the piglet's abdomen or back. Yesterday, the French Concession meat industry received a notice from the market that because the hair on the piglet's abdomen and back was easily blurred after shearing, a new method would be implemented starting today (the 29th): first-grade pigs would not be marked, second-grade pigs would have one hole punched in their right ear, third-grade pigs would have two holes, and fourth-grade pigs would have three holes.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Aojiang, Foreign Ships Affected; Glen Line's "Glenshiel" and China Navigation Company's "New Peking" Damaged; Japanese Planes Strafe Barges with Machine Guns, Infringing on Coastal Navigation Rights of Various Nations

Further investigations into the bombing of Aojiang in eastern Zhejiang have revealed that three Japanese naval aircraft suddenly appeared over Aojiang around 2:00 PM on the 25th and dropped five bombs on the docks, causing fires in riverside houses that burned fiercely. Two bombs landed near the docks, causing shrapnel damage to Glen Line's British ship "Glenshiel" and China Navigation Company's "New Peking." The afterdeck of the "Glenshiel" was destroyed, and the cabin windows and berths of the "New Peking" were shattered. Japanese planes also strafed barges with machine guns, killing two boatmen.

Two British Ships Depart to Shanghai to Avoid Situation

The "Glenshiel" and "New Peking" intended to leave the docks immediately when the Japanese planes bombed, but they were stopped by military police. They only managed to escape to the exit on the 25th. At the time, two military police officers were still on board the "New Peking." After passing the blockade line, they hired a small boat to send them back and proceeded directly to Shanghai. They arrived in Shanghai around 6:00 PM the night before last (the 27th). The "Glenshiel" is docked at the Yangshupu pontoon, and the "New Peking" is docked at the Bund Wharf in the French Concession. Workers have already been hired to repair all the damaged parts. Jardine Matheson & Co.'s British ship "Xin Xiang Tai" arrived at Aojiang on the 25th to load cargo and was stopped from entering the port by Japanese warships. It is currently anchored outside the port, and the company is planning to observe the situation before deciding on further action. Yih Lung Company's "Shen You" is anchored at a certain place at the exit.

Bombing Aimed at Preventing Navigation

A reporter from Da Guang News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that Aojiang is about 100 li away from Wenzhou and used to have Chinese ships sailing there. After the war, the area was blockaded by the authorities, allowing only navigation to the port of Wenzhou. Subsequently, due to harassment by Japanese warships, it was also blockaded. Recently, after requests from various foreign shipping companies, permission was granted to reopen the route. As a result, British ships such as the "Xin An Li" resumed sailing to facilitate cargo transportation, but the Japanese side immediately obstructed this, announcing that the area would be re-blockaded from the evening of the 17th of this month and navigation would be prohibited. The ships then changed course to Aojiang, and the goods were transferred to Wenzhou from there. The Japanese planes then bombed the area, with the aim of completely preventing foreign ships from sailing, infringing on the navigational rights of various countries.

The Origins and Treatment of Hidden Diseases Between Couples

After marriage, there are several strange ailments that may befall a couple. On the surface, there may appear to be nothing wrong, but the internal physical and mental harm can be more severe than any other illness. The pain is like a mute eating Coptis chinensis, unable to express their suffering, and simply shedding tears internally!

It is a common occurrence that the passion between couples gradually fades. An emotionally fervent husband may even suspect his beloved wife of infidelity. At the same time, a deeply affectionate wife may be alarmed to see her husband's health gradually decline, having nightmares at night and being filled with sorrow during the day. Why does a man's health decline after marriage? According to medical analysis, it is mostly due to early self-abuse and nocturnal emissions, or post-marital debauchery, which depletes the reproductive gland fluids that are essential for health. This leads to neurasthenia, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, premature aging, and a host of other symptoms. Such a sick husband not only suffers from the inability to bear the burden of the family, but also cannot fulfill his obligations in the life of love, often leaving his beloved wife hanging. While he himself is unable to cope, his wife, who is full of love and affection, suffers a serious impact on her body and mind. Many young women suffer from menstrual disorders, lack of sensation, anemia, infertility, breast tumors, and hysterical symptoms, mostly due to unsatisfactory sexual life. In a magazine, a doctor published many similar cases, saying, "When the husband's premature ejaculation is cured, the wife's lack of sensation is also cured." The conclusion is: "Uterine congestion and mental disorders in women are particularly related to an unsatisfactory sex life."

Hidden illnesses, private suffering, for yourself and others, should be treated quickly! If you hide your illness and avoid medical treatment, you will harm yourself and others, falling into endless misery! Regarding treatment methods, world-renowned doctors and I, Zhan Nianceng, recommend reproductive gland extract "Spermogen" as the most effective treatment. This agent is extracted from the reproductive glands of robust animals such as orangutans, bears, deer, and seals, and is concentrated and replicated using scientific methods. Therefore, its quality is precious and its restorative power is unparalleled. After taking it, it can generate essence, replenish the kidneys, nourish nerves, strengthen the brain, and invigorate blood within a day and night, exerting five major functions. Regular use can promote development and regulate metabolism, not only eradicating various symptoms in a short period of time, but also achieving the effects of prolonging life and rejuvenating youth. Women should take "Female Spermogen" to eliminate various hidden diseases, with even more significant effects!

Patient Chen Dongyuan suffered from severe brain weakness and kidney deficiency due to nocturnal emissions and debauchery. As a result, he was unemployed at home, and his marriage was disharmonious, with their relationship as cold as ice. He came to me for treatment last month. After a careful examination, I instructed him to purchase "Hemitol's Sperm Strengthening Tablets" and "Spermogen" at the Yong An Company pharmacy and take them together. The nocturnal emissions stopped after a week. After a month, he felt his brain was clear and his energy was abundant. The love between husband and wife was restored, and he was newly hired by a large company. Love and career came together, what happiness!

### The Worries After Untreated Spermatorrhea

— Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

A minor illness that is cured quickly is unavoidable. However, one must never delay when they are sick. Many fatal serious illnesses start from delaying treatment of minor ailments. For example, spermatorrhea in a young man, if treated quickly, is insignificant and easy to treat. If left untreated, the seminal gate will inevitably loosen, progressing from light nocturnal emission to severe spermatorrhea. Due to the long-term sperm leakage, essence withers and blood dries up, leading to kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and neurasthenia. It is even common for it to develop into anemia, tuberculosis, and premature death!

Semen, in physiological terms, is the reproductive gland fluid, and it is indeed the source of our life. In addition to its role in reproduction, it helps promote development, nourish nerves, and regulate metabolism. Therefore, those with depleted semen cannot escape the aforementioned symptoms and will feel weak and incapable in the essential reproductive work of life, or even completely impotent and unable to procreate. Thus, even with a beautiful wife, they cannot enjoy her grace, and can only become a sinner in love and a useless person in society!

To save young men suffering from spermatorrhea, German Dr. Hemitol spent decades of painstaking experimentation and secretly formulated a special medicine for treating spermatorrhea, "Hemitol's Sperm Strengthening Tablets." After clinical trials by famous Chinese and foreign doctors and myself, it was determined that this medicine effectively strengthens the seminal gate and calms the nerves, providing a miraculous effect of inducing sleep and stopping nocturnal emissions on the same night. However, for those who already have the above symptoms due to untreated spermatorrhea, they must also take the reproductive gland extract "Spermogen" to fundamentally nourish the brain, kidneys, essence, blood, and nerves. Continued use can promote development and regulate metabolism, not only eradicating various symptoms in a short period of time, but also achieving the effects of prolonging life and rejuvenating youth.

Patient Zhuang Yanqiang, from Jiangxi, 23 years old, was studying at a university. He brought his family to Shanghai, and had suffered from spermatorrhea for three years. Recently, he suffered from severe brain weakness and kidney deficiency. He often failed his exams, and feared them. Due to an unsatisfactory marriage, the relationship between husband and wife was as cold as ice. He felt the darkness and pain of life. He came to me for treatment during the summer vacation, and I immediately instructed him to purchase "Hemitol's Sperm Strengthening Tablets" and "Spermogen" at the China and Western Pharmacy and take them together, and also applied electrotherapy and injections. Now, after one and a half months, all his ailments have suddenly disappeared. His energy is abundant and even surpasses that of ordinary people!

### Distorted and Withered Peaks Lack Health and Beauty

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

A woman with a slender body, high and firm breasts, full hips, coupled with rosy cheeks and vibrant blood, naturally exudes joy and generosity in daily life. In her words and actions, she possesses boundless charm and beauty, which is truly something to be proud of! If such a beautiful woman meets a talented man and they form a happy marriage, their harmonious love will surely lead to intelligent children and a joyful family. On leisurely days after work, she can accompany her beloved husband and lead her own little angel, going in and out of parks and the countryside. Seeing such a scene, wouldn't people exclaim, "I only envy the loving couple, not the immortals!" Therefore, a woman's health and beauty are indeed the source of her happiness!

If a woman completely loses her health and beauty, the tragedy of her fate is unimaginable! Think about it, which man would want to marry a sickly and ugly old woman? Even if he did, he would not cherish her and might even abandon her! How does a woman lose her health and beauty? According to medical judgment, the cause is often self-indulgence or suffering from menstrual disorders, leucorrhea, infertility, anemia, tuberculosis, and other diseases that damage the function of the ovaries. The ovaries are the central point for the development of a woman's unique beauty. If the ovarian function is weakened, the breasts will not develop well, or if they have already developed, they will gradually wither and shrink. The hips will also become thin, lacking curves. Blood will be deficient, and the face will appear pale or sallow, showing signs of premature aging. If such a woman is then abandoned by her husband, she would feel a sense of rootlessness and drifting in this desolate autumn scene! However, seeking a remedy is not difficult. According to world-renowned gynecologists and my own experience, taking ovarian preparations, the female "Reproductive Hormone," can certainly drive away the above symptoms to the farthest clouds. This medicine is a world-famous gynecological remedy. After taking it, it can regulate menstruation, stop leucorrhea, and promote development. It can cure various symptoms in a short period of time, and regular use can make the breasts stand up, the face become rosy, and youth be prolonged.

### Singapore Restricts Imports, Shanghai Manufacturers Pay Close Attention, Local Government Promulgates National Defense Financial Regulations, Chinese Goods Exporting Southward Are Obstructed and Currently Under Negotiation

The government of the Straits Settlements (Singapore) in Malaya promulgated foreign exchange control regulations starting from September 13th, including Chinese legal tender. The local government promulgated national defense financial regulations, which must be followed by all people within the colony regarding foreign exchange transactions and the trade of foreign securities. Regarding foreign securities, it is limited to British citizens only. All foreign securities under the above control must be returned to the government and cannot be transferred without government permission. All gold should be sold to the government. Since the government promulgated the regulations, our overseas Chinese have paid great attention to them, because a quarter of the residents of Malaya are our overseas Chinese, most of whom need to remit money back home to support their families. Therefore, the government has also adopted lenient measures to reassure the people. The so-called remittances for household use are limited to 500 Straits dollars per person. Beyond this limit, a request must be made to the government. The details of the situation are described below.

Foreign Exchange Control: The Malayan government has designated Standard Chartered Bank, HSBC, the Indian Commercial Bank, and the Oriental Bank to have full authority to purchase gold and foreign exchange. Other banks (including Chinese banks) are affiliated with the banks designated by the government. The prices of imported goods and travel expenses must first be submitted to the local government for approval before they can be approved. All banks must submit their full daily sales details to the government. Importers must provide evidence for goods ordered before September 14th and request registration with the import registrar. After government registration, imports can proceed as usual. If imported after the promulgation of the regulations, an application must first be submitted to the authorities for approval before import and remittance to other countries are permitted. There are also separate regulations for release fees. After foreign exchange control, the market has changed slightly, but is generally stable and orderly.

Remittances by Overseas Chinese: Overseas Chinese have close ties with local finance. The authorities have specifically stipulated that each remittance is limited to 500 Straits dollars, which can be remitted to the country as usual without any problems. The exchange rate is 100 legal tender dollars equal to 15.75 Straits dollars, and the Hong Kong exchange rate is 100 Hong Kong dollars equal to 54 Straits dollars. Major banks such as the Bank of China and the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation conduct remittances as usual. There are more than one million overseas Chinese in Malaya, mostly from Fujian and Guangdong provinces. Although parts of these two provinces have fallen, the banks operated by Chinese people are making every effort to dredge them, which is really a complete relationship with the country and the people's strength.

Import Ban: The local government also simultaneously promulgated a list of 34 types of goods from non-sterling countries that are prohibited from import (except those specifically permitted by the import registrar). The purpose is to protect the level of the gold standard and prevent gold from escaping. The list includes: (1) taxable beverages and tobacco, (2) animals not for food, (3) non-metallic minerals and non-coal minerals, (4) raw cotton, (5) other raw materials for piece goods, (6) pottery, glass, and non-cement and glass jars, etc., (7) non-iron products, etc., (8) electrical appliances, (9) machinery, (10) cotton money and products, (11) wool products, (12) silk and silk fabrics, (13) other raw materials for piece goods, ramie is not included, (14) clothing, (15) medicinal materials, (16) leather and products, (17) vehicles, (18) rubber products, (19) bracelets, (20) imitation pearls, (21) furniture, (22) antiques, (23) all cosmetic products, (24) artificial flowers, (25) gold thread, (26) imitation gold leaf and silver leaf, (27) jewelry and goldsmith supplies, (28) paint supplies, (29) lamps and lanterns, etc., (30) various musical instruments, (31) perfumes and powders, etc., (32) paintings, (33) silversmith supplies, (34) silver thread, etc. Therefore, the above goods cannot be easily transported to Singapore in the future. However, for each importer, if the goods are ordered before September 14, they must register with the customs within two days and present evidence, such as telegrams, bookkeeping letters, etc., that can prove the order, and can still obtain an import permit. As for the goods that can be imported other than the above 34 types of prohibited items, the permission of the authorities must first be obtained, otherwise it is impossible to import or obtain foreign exchange.

Export of National Goods to the South: After Singapore's control of foreign exchange and restrictions on imports, it has a great relationship with the life and economy of overseas Chinese. It is very important to allow the export of Shanghai national goods to the south. Because at this time of domestic sales depression, the only way out is to various places in Nanyang, and all parties attach great importance to it. Overseas Chinese merchants in Nanyang are very excited to purchase and use national goods. According to recent statistics, there are more than 120 companies engaged in national goods, including silk and cotton cloth. There are restrictions on this, and now it is even more prohibited, which is even more severe. Pottery has always been shipped from Shantou. Since the fall of Shantou, few goods have arrived. The glass business is quite good and will be affected. The amount of cotton textiles imported is very large. Regarding electrical appliances, the import of light bulbs is subject to very strict inspections. Wood is not easy. Electrical wires are not allowed to be imported, but there are still many other electrical materials. Leather goods are mainly suitcases. In recent years, many cosmetics have also been exported to Nanyang. Therefore, the goods that are prohibited from import have a very important relationship to the entire export of national goods in Shanghai. Therefore, overseas Chinese leaders are paying close attention to seek aftercare and are negotiating with the local government by the Consul-General in Singapore, Gao Lingbai, so that national goods can travel smoothly. However, there are still many places that need explanation regarding the item decree. If Shanghai manufacturers have any difficulties regarding this problem, they can write to Jin Nanhang, 46A Keening Street, Singapore. This company was founded by Shanghai industry leaders and specializes in the export trade of national goods. It is hosted by Mr. Gao Shiheng, so you can directly write to Mr. Gao, which will definitely be more detailed and clear.

### Banks and Money Houses Were Open Yesterday, All Industries Are Preparing for Matters at the End of October

With financial stability, Shanghai industries safely passed the Mid-Autumn Festival settlement period. Various markets such as foreign exchange, gold, securities, yarn, flowers, groceries, etc., and various banks and money houses were all opened yesterday. However, because the long-term loan period of credit at the end of October is approaching, all industries have begun to prepare for matters at the end of October. The Silver Industry Association has scheduled a meeting on October 25 to discuss the internal market, and has separately consulted with various industries on loan and collection at the end of October.

### Chen Weida's Home Robbery Case, The Suspect Was Found Not Guilty, The Police Lawyer Withdrew the Prosecution, The Defendant Was Allowed to Be Released on Bail Pending Instructions

Chen Weida, a local Catholic living at No. 13, Lane 170, Route Lafayette, was robbed by four thieves at about 7:00 AM on the 6th of this month, and more than 1,000 yuan in cash and goods were taken away. At 6:00 PM on the 12th, Chen's daughter, Bangqian, and the maid, Wang Abao, pointed out Shao Zuoyan, a pedestrian on the tram stop at the intersection of Route Lafayette and the vegetable market, as one of the robbers (28 years old, from Ningbo, working at a store in the Broadway Mansion). Shao was detained by the police and sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution according to law. The case was tried twice by Judge Miao Qingbang, and the hearing was adjourned for further investigation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the hearing was continued. The defendant, Shao Zuoting, hired lawyer Ai Zhenlin to defend him. The plaintiff, Chen Bangqian, and the maid, Wang Abao, came to court and firmly claimed that the defendant was indeed one of the robbers at the time, and they recognized him very clearly. The defendant, Shao Zuoting, absolutely denied being a thief. He claimed that he was on duty at the Broadway Mansion at the time of the robbery and requested an investigation. Subsequently, Dong Abao, Li Guangneng, Wang Changming, Wang Jinsheng, Zhou Jintang, and a British female secretary of the Broadway Mansion, who were colleagues of the defendant, came to court to testify that Shao was working at the Broadway Mansion, working in room 1107 from the 8th to the 14th from 1107 to 1114, going to work at 7:00 AM every morning and leaving work at 7:00 PM. He was on duty on the morning of the 6th, etc. According to Shao's confession, he was going to his aunt's house at No. 5 Sanyu Lane, Route Lafayette, to see his wife when he was arrested. Because his wife was out and the space inside the house was small, it was inconvenient to stay, so he waited at the tram stop, which led to the mistaken arrest. The court also summoned the second landlord Peng Cao of No. 5 Sanyu Lane and Shao's wife for questioning. At this point, the police lawyer expressed his opinion that according to the defendant's confession and the testimony of witnesses, the defendant was not suspected of being a thief and requested to withdraw the prosecution orally first, and then supplement the written request. Judge Miao immediately approved the request and ordered the defendant to pay a guarantor of 2,000 yuan to be available upon call pending instructions.

### Murdering the Pawnshop Accountant, The Convicted Criminal Appeals, Denies Being an Accomplice and Asks for Forgiveness, The Court Adjourned the Trial Pending Judgment

Ye Shizhong, from Dongting Mountain in Suzhou, had an irreconcilable feud with Tang Shenglin, the accountant of Fuchang Pawnshop at No. 122 Zilaihuo Street. Therefore, on April 28 of this year, he opened a room at the Grand Hotel and invited his friends Zhou Jie and Ye Chunnian to have dinner. After cutting their hair and vowing revenge, they went to join the army in Chongqing. At about 10:00 PM that night, each holding a sharp knife, they went to Fuchang Pawnshop and hacked Tang to death. Tang was hacked more than 50 times all over his body. After the case occurred, the French Concession police received a report and ordered detectives to investigate, recovering the blood-stained clothes and murder weapons left by the murderer. In the blood-stained clothes of the murderer, two pawn tickets were found. Based on the clues of the pawn tickets, the residence of Shen Huilian, the mistress of the murderer Ye Shizhong, was found at No. 209 Caishi Road and Shen was arrested. Subsequently, Ye Chunnian, an accomplice, was arrested in Shen's home, while Ye Shizhong and Zhou Jie both escaped without a trace. Later, the French police found that Shen Huilian was not a murderer and did not prosecute her. Ye Chunnian was prosecuted for murder. The case has been tried and sentenced by Judge Miao Qingbang to Ye Chunnian for joint murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Ye refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyer Yang Ruinian to appeal for him. At about 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Wu Tingqi, the head of the Criminal Court of the High Branch Court, accompanied by two judges, Gu and Wang, opened the Fifth Court for trial. Ye Chunnian confessed that he was 21 years old, from Dongting Mountain. He used to be a pawnshop clerk. In recent years, he became unemployed due to the war. He was friends with Ye Shizhong. On the evening of April 18 of this year, he followed Ye Shizhong, Zhou Jie, and Bai Xiang. Unexpectedly, they went to Fuchang Pawnshop to fight. The appellant had not premeditated beforehand and did not help during the incident. As for the previous confession in the police station, it was out of necessity. The original trial sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment, which was really unjust. Subsequently, Jiang Haoqing, an apprentice at Fuchang Pawnshop, testified that Ye Chunnian was an accomplice, vividly describing the events. The court also questioned witnesses Wang Yuanmao, Liu Wenbin, and Shen Huilian. After the questioning, the debate began. The prosecutor advocated sentencing the appellant to death. Lawyer Yang Ruinian asked to declare the appellant not guilty. The court adjourned the trial pending judgment.

### Demanding a Loan, Actually Assaulted, Two Defendants Fined

Xia Huaixian from Nanjing and He Zhenjia from Guangdong were apprentices at Feng Shunchang Paint Factory set up by Feng Zeshen from Guangdong at No. 21 Xinyu Village, Gordon Road, Changping Road, Shanghai. Now that Xia and others have completed their apprenticeships, they have left Feng and set up an Acrylic Paint Construction Company in Room 109 and 810, Yuanmingyuan Road. At the beginning of April this year, Xia borrowed 1,100 yuan from Feng, stating that it would be repaid in installments within one year, but no money has been repaid so far. Therefore, at 10:35 AM on the 19th of the month, Feng ordered his son, Feng Shouhua, to go to Acrylic Company with a receipt to collect the arrears. Xia immediately snatched the receipt and tore it up to achieve the purpose of evading debt. Feng Shouhua intended to take it back, which resulted in Xia and He violently beating him, causing injuries to his left chest and tearing his clothes. Feng Shouhua reported to the General Patrol Room, and Chinese detective Ma Guangqi confirmed the facts. He immediately reported to the First Special Court for the issuance of a summons, and Xia and He were summoned to the Fourth Criminal Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted them for injury under Article 277 of the Criminal Law, and Feng Shouhua also hired lawyer Zuo Detao to file an incidental civil suit, requesting compensation for medical expenses and a suit of clothes, totaling 300 yuan and 6 jiao. When questioned, the two defendants admitted to beating the plaintiff and hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. After questioning by Judge Zhong Qing, it was ruled that Xia and He were each fined 10 yuan and compensated the plaintiff for medical expenses, etc.

### Guard's Handgun Was Robbed

At the corner of Jiaozhou Road and Binlang Road, at about 6:00 PM yesterday, a guard of No. 94 was passing by when he was suddenly stopped by two robbers. One of the robbers took out a handgun and ordered him to disarm. The guard was caught off guard and the handgun he was wearing was robbed by the barehanded robbers, who fled without a trace. The guard could not catch up and immediately reported to the competent police station to file a report and start tracking down the robbers.

### Autumn Coolness Intensifies, Huangpu River Tomorrow's High Tide

After the weather in this city turned autumnal coolness, yesterday was the first day of coldness, because the autumn rain ended all day the day before yesterday, and yesterday it suddenly became sunny and cold. The high tide of the Huangpu River is still continuing today, and tomorrow's tide is expected to be even higher, because the tide on the 18th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar is traditionally the crown of the autumn flood, reaching its peak. In fact, this is not always the case, but the amount of high tide on this day is also very large, which is worth noting.

### Foreman Was Cut

In a workshop of the Asia Petroleum Company in Pudong, Chen Jihua, a foreman from Hubei, 50 years old, was talking to his mistress Yin (40 years old) at home at about 8:30 PM last night when suddenly more than a dozen workers arrived. Without asking the reason, they raised axes and cut Chen's head twice, his neck once, his left arm three times, and his left leg once. Yin's left knee bone was also cut once. After being injured, the two could not support themselves and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, left triumphantly. Afterwards, someone bought a boat to Shanghai and took them to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital reported to the Central Police Station, which sent agent No. 337 to investigate. It is understood that Chen Jihua usually relied on his power to oppress workers, which aroused public outrage and caused this secret assault.

### Touching Crabs and Catching Iron Balls, One Throw Exploded, Zhu Gengsheng Was Seriously Injured

Zhu Gengsheng, 39 years old, living in a flat house near Jiwang Temple, Dongfahua Town, was touching crabs in a small stream in front of his door at about 7:00 AM yesterday morning when he suddenly picked up an iron ball from the river. After inspecting it for a long time, he did not know what it was, so he slammed it against a stone on the shore. The iron ball exploded on the spot as soon as it was slammed. Zhu was unable to avoid it in time, and his chest and arms were seriously injured. Later, his family took him to the hospital for treatment.

### Letter

After reading the report on the 27th of this month that a young boy died of typhoid fever, and there was a question about the previous medicine, the facts are slightly different. Zhang hired a doctor surnamed Jiang to diagnose and treat him in this hall on the 6th of this month, and commissioned this hall to decoct the medicine on his behalf. On the 8th, he changed to doctor Zhang Yijun for diagnosis and treatment. After taking the medicine, he decocted it himself. As for Ju Jielin's agent to hire a doctor, there is no such thing. Zhang Hongjin's illness gradually recovered on the 16th of the same month, but his illness relapsed due to food carelessness. According to the report, he hired doctor Jiang for a follow-up consultation on the 23rd of the same month. The date is two weeks apart. How can there be a follow-up consultation? Dr. Jiang did not have a follow-up consultation, and the patient decocted the medicine himself. Why is it said that it was decocted on his behalf and the prescription was mistaken? This is specially written to request a correction. Sincerely, Tian Ji Tang Traditional Chinese Medicine Store, September 28.

Zou Zhengzhi, the class leader of the third grade of the private Shanghai Middle School on Chengdu Road, usually disagreed with his classmate Fang Yimou. At 10:30 AM on the 20th of this month, he conspired with his former classmates Wang Biqing, Chinese detective No. 301, and Li Boqing, Chinese detective No. 215, who are now serving in the French Police Station, to severely beat Fang in the school dormitory, causing serious injuries.

### Jian De Bank Bankruptcy Case, Xie Keming, Yu Yuanxiang and Others Were Sentenced

Shanghai Jian De Commercial Savings Bank was adjudicated bankrupt by the Shanghai First Special District Local Court in July of the 24th year of the Republic of China. Accountant Li Ding was selected as the bankruptcy administrator. Before and after the bankruptcy, the creditors and the bank's directors and supervisors had filed lawsuits and disputes endlessly. For example, the directors Xie Keming and others were sentenced to fines ranging from 1,000 yuan to 1,500 yuan for making false statements during the capital increase registration and for not filing for bankruptcy when the company's assets were insufficient to pay off debts, and were jointly liable for compensating more than 240,000 yuan of false capital. The registration of its limited company was also revoked by the Ministry of Finance and Industry. In January of this year, the creditors Wei Haijiang and Wang Ruyao hired lawyers Weng Zhifan, Gu Kenfu, and Mi Gegu to file a criminal lawsuit against Xie Keming, Yu Yuanxiang, Yan Fangfang, and Qin Wenqun for crimes such as collusion between the bankrupt and the bankruptcy administrator, representing untrue debts, harming the rights of the bankruptcy estate and bankruptcy creditors, and privately receiving loans, altering account books and forging signatures, and requesting a sentence. Judge Jiang Shuzi of the Third Criminal Court, because the facts were complicated, summoned more than 40 witnesses and opened more than 20 courts. The judgment was announced the day before yesterday. Xie Keming and Yu Yuanxiang were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment for jointly using forged documents, and each to one year of imprisonment for jointly committing breach of trust. The sentence for each should be executed for one year and two months. Yan Fangfang and Qin Wenqun were each sentenced to six months of imprisonment for jointly committing breach of trust, with a three-year suspended sentence. Most of the creditors of the bank are residents of Zhabei and Hongkou, and workers on both roads. After the war, they have suffered a lot of displacement. Since the bank's bankruptcy, creditors have complained. Now that the inside story of its bankruptcy fraud has been revealed, the bankruptcy event may need to be reprocessed.

### Young Woman Abandoned Her Husband and Ran Away, Came to Shanghai and Remarried, The Original Husband Found Out and Reported the Case to the Police

Chen Shanhua (28 years old) from Nanjing married Tao Fengying (22 years old), a woman from the same village, through a matchmaker in his early years in his hometown. Unexpectedly, in the summer of the year before last, Tao took away cash and clothing, etc., and ran away from her husband. Chen inquired everywhere, but there was no news. Until June last year, a friend told him that his wife Tao had changed her name to Hang Xiaomei and was now cohabiting with Guan Zhaokui (26 years old, from Nanjing), Chinese policeman No. 685 of the French Police Station, in Shanghai, as if they were husband and wife. After Chen learned of this, he made a special trip to Shanghai. However, Shanghai is vast and complicated, and it is not easy to find her. On the one hand, a friend introduced Chen to work as a partner in the tiger stove at No. 50 Laosenfu Road. It was not until the 22nd of this month that he found out the hiding place of his wife and Guan. However, after Tao met him, she firmly denied that she was Chen's runaway wife. The two sides wrestled each other to the French Police Station. As a result, the police chief ordered Tao to hand Chen a certificate and lead him back to the case. After Chen left the police station, he sent his wife Tao to live with relatives. Unexpectedly, at about 9:00 PM on the 25th, her lover Guan Zhaokui suddenly led six or seven men to Chen's place and forcibly robbed Tao without asking the situation. Afterwards, Chen reported the information to the police station, which sent detectives to arrest Tao and Guan and bring them to the police station. They were transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday. When questioned, the defendant Tao Fengying confessed that because her husband Chen Shanhua did not engage in proper business and repeatedly decided to abandon her, she came to Shanghai and remarried to Guan through the introduction of relatives and friends. When Guan Zhaokui was interrogated, he confessed that he and Tao were married at the time and had formal marriage certificates, etc. After verifying the confession in court, it was decided that the case would be returned to the police station for investigation before the case was submitted for trial again.

Spring and Autumn

### Today's Shanghai West: Brilliant Lights Shine Like a Lunar Palace, Yet Terrifying Dens of Evil Rival Hell

It is said that the good Buddhist emperor of China, Tang Minghuang, once dreamt of traveling to the lunar palace. It is also said that the Western poet Dante once entered hell... If these two were to be reborn now, I would invite them to stroll around Shanghai West. There, the brilliant lights shine like a lunar palace. There, terrifying dens of evil rival hell.

This is definitely not a fabrication. If you don't believe me, go and see for yourself. Every three steps there's a "company," and every five steps there's a "club." At night, the reddish lamps cast a red and green glow, like seductive young women beckoning to people. In reality, they are "rotten on the inside," all synonymous with gambling dens and opium houses. As for the exact number, it's simply impossible to count.

Alas, many kind and ignorant people are happily lured in, lose all their money, and dejectedly slink out. The signs on the many telephone poles along the street that say "Building a New Order in East Asia" secretly laugh at them.

Furthermore, the pernicious "Flower Guessing Hall" openly displays its signboard, protected by certain forces. The sign lists what "Nine Official" will be opened early, and what "Door Patterns" will be opened in the middle of the day or at night, all prominently displayed. Elaborate ones even have poetic riddles, such as: "Life in this world is but emptiness, what use is there in hoarding wealth?"... It's simply insulting our poets Li Bai and Du Fu. I ask you, what kind of false poet in this world would advise people to send money to ghosts?

Zhaofeng Garden is cold and detached, like a proud chrysanthemum stuck in a pile of dung, or like a chaste young woman coldly watching the "XXX Paradise" across the street, under the protection of the fake police, putting on all sorts of seductive displays, attracting tens of thousands of people, constantly flowing in and out. Indeed, there are lavish decorations, swaying lights, and boisterous sounds... It can truly be said that nothing is lacking. However, they are not filming a movie, but openly cheating people out of their money—gambling with people's lives!

At the crossroads, the positions of the Chinese police have been occupied by the fake police. On the left corner are three fake police officers carrying automatic rifles, and on the right corner stand three patrol officers, all facing each other. For the most part, they can still show some consideration for the Chinese and remain at peace (?).

Most detestable are the gangs of short-clothed ruffians, bare-chested and swaggering. Sometimes, if you pass by, you might be openly robbed even in broad daylight. Only then will you experience what the so-called "new order" construction is all about! (Sick Big Worm)

### Starting with Rebuilding Morality

— Liu Lang

Yesterday, a morality rebuilding movement held a gathering in Shanghai. Examining its intentions, they are extremely good. Once morality is respected by the world, all robbery and slaughter will naturally disappear.

However, in the past two or three years, morality has long been swept away. Robbers naturally disregard morality, and victims cannot obtain the assistance of the world's morality. From then on, unreasonable arguments prevail over public reason, and the survival of the fittest has almost become a very legitimate thing.

Let's not talk about world events, just the current situation in Shanghai. The so-called robber spirit, through more than two years of historical lessons, has influenced the general merchants. Merchants inherently have merchant morality, but now that morality has been discarded, it also takes making profit as a prerequisite. The chaos in the commercial situation a month ago is a clear proof.

"It's not against the law to do business!" is a very common slogan in the mouths of merchants. When you discover that what you get is far from what you paid for when buying goods, and you argue with the merchant, the merchant will definitely explain his slogan very confidently, such as: "My things are also bought with money!" "My things are not robbed or stolen!" "It is right to make money in business!" "If you are not satisfied, you can go to the court to sue me!" Even if you have been cheated badly, it is difficult to argue. If you go to court to sue, they are reputable merchants and are unlikely to be approved. Moreover, who would go to great lengths for trivial matters?

If this kind of merchant spirit is promoted and expanded, it will have various different consequences. For example: promoting domestic goods in name but actually selling inferior goods. Speculating and manipulating, hoarding for profit. Furthermore, using reputable merchants as a front, secretly attempting to be heroes and heroines in troubled times! Who can say "no"? They are "doing business without breaking the law"!

Regarding this kind of abnormal development, there is nothing wrong with us advocating rebuilding morality. Unfortunately, it is like playing the lute to a cow, its effect is equal to a breeze in the ear.

Morality must be maintained. However, this cannot be achieved by empty talk or a piece of declaration. Being able to formulate new legal laws based on morality, with strength as the backing for enforcing the laws, then major issues such as robbery and slaughter, and minor issues such as manipulating for profit, can all be subject to severe legal sanctions. All bad tendencies will naturally gradually come to an end.

### Electric Wire (Poetic Machinery Talk)

— Ru

What was definitely noticed by the poets of the time was "electric money."

One of the most widely circulated was "Shanghai Little Ballads," one of four chapters by Misty Viewing Flowers Guest:

Loving the jasper peach blossoms,
I sing of the white round fan.
Electric wires lie dormant beneath the sea,
Who can see them coming and going?

It is an imitation of the Midnight Wu Song. However, this does not express the author's understanding of the electric wire itself. On this point, the old owner of Twenty-Three Rooms' "Shanghai Good" understood it more deeply:

Shanghai is good, the electric wire is as fast as thunder.
Languages are spoken face to face across thousands of miles,
Information is heard instantly across the oceans.
The machinery is invisible.

The function of the electric wire is written more broadly, not limited to personal affairs. Wu Rongsen's "Three Poems on Current Affairs," one of which is "Electric Wire," is written in more detail. Such as "Suddenly hearing distant voices in the empty valley," such as "News is like the wind passing through a flute," such as "Thousands of giant trees appear scratching the sky, traveling thousands of miles like lightning," are all very relevant and more comprehensive. It is a pity that it concludes with praising the imperial court, inevitably inviting ridicule as a "stereotyped poem." Anonymous' "Four Poems of the Foreign Field," one of which is "Electric Wire," has similar content:

How does electricity reach?
Heaven's secrets are not easily understood.
Connecting across thousands of miles,
News is instantly known.
Stealing the power of thunder,
Only to explore the clues of the wire.
From now on, sending letters,
No longer relying on carp letters.

This is a "window lesson" that mixes science and superstition into one. Gu, most of the works praising "electric wires" at the time reflected such thoughts and unprincipled surprise. In the early days of opening up the seas, it was not surprising. Wang Zhichun's "Telegram" written during his travels in Japan is no exception, also saying:

Why bother with ink and painstaking effort?
A wire carries sound across thousands of miles.
Mountains and lakes can all conduct electricity,
Traveling back and forth without relying on the wind.
Human ingenuity is too clever, Heaven should be jealous,
Few words, but the meaning is all-encompassing.
Crossing the three thousand weak waters is easy,
To send messages to Penglai for me.

However, its small preface is excellent, saying: "Electrical telegrams use copper as the wire, with a very small diameter. Using the electricity refined by Westerners, it is either erected on wood or placed in water, extending it. Both ends are connected to machines. The sound transmitted travels through the wire, reaching thousands of miles in an instant." The impression given is clearer than his poem.

Therefore, in terms of poetry, Misty Viewing Flowers Guest's work is still the first choice.

The remaining three chapters of Misty Viewing Flowers Guest's "Shanghai Little Ballads," one praising "electric lights," one praising "machinery," and one praising "light gas balloons," all mix "machinery" and "love" into one, making them excellent early works of machinery entering poetry. They are also attached here:

Don't use glass as a mirror,
Don't waste kerosene lamps.
Only illuminate the lover's face,
Do not illuminate the lover's heart. (1)

Yesterday, brocade flowers on brocade,
Today, thorns on the road.
The iron factory gave birth to the lover's heart,
How can machinery be measured? (2)

The bright moon does not stay bright for long,
Good flowers do not stay good for long.
Strange light gas balloons,
They will fall with the wind. (3)

### An Urgent Motion

— Feng

A few days ago, the newspaper reported that the Ningbo Native Association and Mr. Yu Qiaqing, in view of the current very depressed industrial and commercial situation in Shanghai, and the high prices and difficult living conditions, specifically wrote to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce to persuade fellow villagers not to come to Shanghai easily, lest they be unable to make a living and become vagrants in Shanghai..." I think this advice is extremely meaningful. From this advice, I feel that there is indeed a need to go a step further and expand it.

In the past, it was indeed easier to make a living in Shanghai, because many people came to Shanghai barefoot, and after only a few years of struggle, they became very influential people. There was no shortage of people who even made a fortune and leaped into becoming wealthy tycoons. The performance of this fact made everyone regard Shanghai as a place "paved with gold," so they all ran to Shanghai. However, since the war, Shanghai has become a safe haven for refugees. Life in the interior and the occupied areas is so difficult, and Shanghai has always been called a place paved with gold, so not going to Shanghai to seek a way out would be too great a loss. As a result, the rapid increase in population has made it the most densely populated city in the world. However, is today's Shanghai really a place "paved with gold"? With rising prices and the decline of industry and commerce, Shanghai itself is in danger of collapsing, so wanting to make a fortune in Shanghai is really a pipe dream. Even seeking a place to eat is as difficult as climbing to the sky, so Mr. Yu Qiaqing was able to warn his fellow villagers not to come to Shanghai easily, which is indeed a very insightful wake-up call. Moreover, in recent months, the newspapers have been constantly reporting tragic news of suicides caused by people coming to Shanghai from afar and being unable to make a living, which is the most concrete example. Now I sincerely hope that the remaining native associations in Shanghai of various counties may all come up with earnest advice, warning fellow villagers not to rush to Shanghai rashly. As Mr. Yu Qiaqing said: "...Rather than coming to Shanghai and being unable to make a living and becoming a vagrant, wouldn't it be better to find opportunities in your hometown?" This kind of advice is not only the duty of the various native associations, but also a praiseworthy deed.

As for us, we should also always advise our fellow villagers, telling them in detail the truth about the "isolated island." This can supplement the inadequacies of the native associations' letters of advice. If we can all implement this, I think the number of such suicide incidents on the "isolated island" may decrease.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Sixteen: Planning to Revive Medical Studies, Establishing a School; Thinking of Expanding Village Governance, Entrusting Children to Have a Place

Zhu Ai-ren then called Wu Junsu, knowing that she had already returned to her dormitory. Because today was only Thursday, it was good to arrange it earlier. There was a telephone on Ai-ren's desk. She picked it up, dialed the Suzhou Telephone Bureau, and then transferred to the Dongwu University faculty and staff dormitory. In a moment, she was talking to Wu Junsu. Ai-ren said, "Did you receive Jin Danyu's wedding invitation?" Junsu said, "I received it long ago. It's awful, she didn't mention it when she came to see the play last Saturday night. Now the invitation to the wedding banquet has suddenly arrived. When are you planning to go?" Ai-ren said, "Exactly! We wanted to ask you when you are going? Because the two He sisters and I are planning to go on Saturday afternoon. Because we all have some other things besides attending the wedding banquet. I don't know if you are going on Saturday afternoon? If you are also going on Saturday, we can go together, we will come to see you at the school. We will decide what time to take the train, and we can have some fun on the train." Junsu said, "Saturday afternoon is fine, anyway, I don't have class on Saturday afternoon. She also gave a ticket to my sister Junke. She originally didn't want to go, but I persuaded her to go play together. You say what time to take the train, I can do it here." Ai-ren and the He sisters discussed and said, "Let's take the three o'clock train. At first, Danyu said that she wanted to be thrifty this time, but now the place is rented at the Universal Hotel, which is the largest hotel in Shanghai, can she still be thrifty? This is a very lavish wedding." Junsu said, "This cannot be blamed on her, I am afraid that she also has no choice. Because her occupation is like this, she is associating with the first-class foreigners all day long. Knowing that she is getting married, they all want to come to her wedding banquet. It is not good to be too stingy in entertaining foreign friends, this is a matter of national dignity. Fortunately, Jin Danyu is fine, she has a backer, her backer is very strong, definitely not an iceberg as people say." Ai-ren said, "Who is the backer you are talking about? Isn't it Mrs. Su Liya?" Junsu said, "How can it not be? Old Mrs. Su simply treats her like her own daughter. Although she has a biological daughter in her own country, she is no less to Danyu than to her own daughter. Yu Danyu is considered Old Mrs. Su's Chinese daughter, do you agree? This time, Danyu is getting married, and she is the host. Because Danyu's father was a martyr, and the old lady has also passed away. Probably Danyu wants to be thrifty, but Old Mrs. Su does not agree, she insists on being lavish. They Americans are of course the most generous people in the world." (186)

Random Notes of an Artist

Acting is truly a very difficult and arduous job! Recalling my childhood when I began to learn acting, and dedicating myself to the stage, nearly twenty years have passed. I have traveled more than ten thousand miles. Speaking from experience, it seems that I should be considered quite rich; but in terms of art, I am very ashamed to have only gained a false reputation. I have not achieved anything that I can feel grateful and happy about.

Learning to Act at Seven Years Old

When I was a child, I started learning to act at the age of seven, specializing in female roles—Qingyi and Huashan. In order to concentrate on practicing acting and not be distracted, I did not study at that time; when I grew up, I realized this mistake. Although I immediately worked hard to study on my own and continued to strive forward, my knowledge and application of writing are still very superficial, and I feel it is very insufficient. Now, when I read newspapers every day and often read new literary books, such as novels by famous authors such as Ba Jin, to pass the time, I cannot help but often deeply feel the pain of not studying when I was young.

Traveling All Over the North and South

My acting life began when I was ten years old, when I first performed on stage in Changsha. Since then, I have traveled to various ports along the Yangtze River, and spent a long time in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and even as far south as Fujian and Guangdong, for a total of five or six years. In 1929, I first came to Shanghai, working at the former Samsung Stage, and performing the continuous plays "Water Margin" and "Peng Gong'an" with Mr. Zhao Ruquan and others for three full years. Later, I went to Wuhan twice, and to the three northeastern provinces and Beijing-Tianjin twice for nearly two years. In 1936, I returned to Shanghai and was hired by the Golden Grand Theater to cooperate with Mr. Li Wanchun for three months, and then transferred to the Gong Stage for one month. The following year, I sang at the Tianchan Stage for nearly half a year. Later, after the "August 13th" incident, I worked with Mr. Ouyang Yuqian to improve Peking Opera, performing in Shanghai for nearly two months. Last winter, I was hired by the "Golden Theater," and soon after, I went to Hong Kong. This wandering acting life has lasted for a total of fourteen years.

### "Renewal" After the Renewal: A Record of the First Night of Peking Opera Performance

— Nai Wo

The Renewal Stage has been completely renewed, sending people north to invite a large number of Peking Opera performers, who began to meet the people of Shanghai on the Mid-Autumn Festival. That evening, the seats were sold out. Mr. Zhang Shankun accompanied the four major movie stars Chen Yunshang, Li Minghui, Tong Yuejuan, and Chen Yanyan to watch the play, which added a lot of color to the theater. The reporter was also one of the guests. Upon arriving at the theater, Li Duokui's Fishing for a Golden Turtle had already reached its finale. Duokui has not come south for many years, and his voice is as loud as before, so he is very popular with the audience. Following Fishing for a Golden Turtle, Liang Huichao's Picking the Carriage came on stage. Huichao is one of the rising martial artists, only nineteen years old, and his waist and leg skills are excellent. His leg is comparable to Wang Shaolou of the Gong Stage. However, he is full of sea air, which is undesirable. Although he can cater to the audience's tastes, Liang likes to show off his waist and leg skills, so his poses and movements are often the same. He can only be called a "charger." His temper has not faded, and his skills are still shallow. His voice is still a boy's voice, which is a disadvantage because he cannot project it. However, he is still a talented person and can be expected to achieve great things in time. Chen Shaolin had previously come to Shanghai with Cheng Yanqiu, but failed to leave a deep impression on the people of Shanghai. Watching Shaolin perform Catching and Releasing at the Inn last night, he has indeed improved compared to before. His body is no longer as stiff as before. It is a pity that his voice is not loud enough (the tone is not low, but sitting behind the sixth row, it is not easy to hear clearly), so phrases such as "His family has suffered disaster" cannot be sung high, and it seems not very pleasing to the ear. It may be that Shaolin's capital is insufficient, or it may be due to travel fatigue. The large slow board of the inn scene was the most moving, and it can be said that Shaolin sings Erhuang better than singing Xipi. Li Chunheng's Cao Cao is completely in the style of Hao. He is more like Hao Shouchen than Yuan Shihai. However, some strange tones make the audience laugh, as if listening to Yan Jupeng's first tone. The finale, Four or Five Flower Caves, features Liang Yunqiu and Li Wanyun as the real Pan Jinlian, and Wu Ziqiu and Zhao Jinrong as the fake Pan Jinlian. The four-sentence slow board of "Pan Jinlian cannot help but be annoyed" is not that each of the two sings two sentences. The real Pan Jinlian sings the first sentence, and the fake Pan Jinlian repeats the first sentence. This undoubtedly shows their abilities and forms a confrontation, which is rarely seen on stage. In terms of singing, Zhao Jinrong is not inferior to Wu Suqiu, while Li and Liang are slightly worse, so the applause for the real Pan Jinlian is not as much as for the fake Pan Jinlian. In terms of appearance, Wu Suqiu is the best among the four. Apart from Wu, Li Wanyun is graceful and charming. In addition, the body movements and stage steps of the four are all excellent, which is worth noting for a reporter. Sun Shengwu's county magistrate is full of humor and is a handsome man among the clowns. It is said that the plan for the Renewal Stage is that Wu, Zhao, and Liang will take turns performing, each singing for ten days. These three each have their own strengths, and there is no shortage of people who support them, so it is expected that their appeal will not be weak.

New Movie Introduction

### A Frivolous Sin

— Qi Hua "Bachelor Mother"

After watching "A Frivolous Sin," I was indeed attracted by this clever story, and couldn't help but smile knowingly at the advertising posters at the door. But in the line of cars, suddenly a old woman emerged, carrying a scantily clad child in her arms, begging the gentlemen and ladies. The old woman's painful face and sobbing voice seemed to be the same as the woman in "A Frivolous Sin" who abandoned the baby. So, my thoughts returned to this clever story. When everyone is laughing at this funny story, who notices the woman who abandoned the child? If our vision can jump over the camera and follow the woman, what will we see? But the playwright is clever. He abandoned the protagonist of "A Frivolous Sin" and made us forget her.

Hollywood is now competing to shoot comedies, or that is the reason. But no matter how clever the scriptwriting skills, it will eventually expose weaknesses in front of us. The short few feet of film, the fleeting appearance of the woman, also made us see another side of this society: unemployment, poverty, countless hungry and cold faces!

This clever story, after being rendered by the director, is really full of gimmicks. It almost makes the audience's laughter never stop.

Several scenes are even more lovely. Such as (1) Polly is summoned to the manager's office, David allows Polly to be reinstated and increases her salary. The director fully utilizes his skillful comedic skills to develop the different thoughts of David, Polly, and the orphanage staff. (2) On New Year's Eve, David and Polly are separated in the joyful crowd. They see each other across the street but cannot greet each other. So they jump up in the crowd; when the two face each other, due to the noise of the surroundings, their words can only be seen through the movement of their lips—these two close-up shots are very novel and accompany the joyful situation of the crowd on New Year's Eve. (3) David's father follows David and mistakes the child for his grandson; and (4) the dispute between father and son at breakfast is extremely humorous. Finally, the reunion is brought about by the child dropping a toy duck, which also shows the director's cleverness.

Qing Shu Luo Jisi has already let us know in "Dragon Gate Flower Moon" that she is not just a singer and dancer. The role of Polly is well played, and the actor who plays Molin is also very good.

### Casual Paintings of the Entertainment World (17)

— Suzhou Document Writer, Text, Xiu Yan Drawing

The narrative style of the Suzhou Document Writer is no different from that of the ballad singing; the lyrics are unique and completely different: listening to it occasionally, it feels quite refreshing, but listening to it for a long time makes people bored (perhaps this is just my own prejudice).

The representative figure in this is of course Wang Baoqing (in fact, there are only one or two people like this). Once, "Ten Sighs of Emptiness" was popular for a while.

In the past, the Suzhou Document Writer was very popular, but now it has returned from "brilliance" to "plainness."

### Special Record of Shanghai's Song Broadcasting

— Wanderer

"The moon is especially bright on the Mid-Autumn Festival." This "isolated island" fundamentally has "low pressure" that makes it impossible for you to breathe freely. However, the season has come to the autumn festival of the year.

The banners of "Su Guang Mooncakes" are hung on the city signs of major companies. The autumn wind may blow away some of the shadows in my heart. Dragging my heavy heart, I wanted to drink a few cups of Wujiapi wine or mooncakes during the "Mid-Autumn Festival," but the whip of "real life" does not allow it.

Stepping onto Nanjing Road, I unknowingly entered the New Capital Hotel in the elevator.

The radio broadcast of the opera "Song of Shanghai," organized by the Film Stars Association, will embellish the Mid-Autumn Festival on the Glass Radio!

What is brilliant is a piece of starlight of the film people, there are Bai Hong wearing a red vest, Sun Min giggling, Zhou Manhua delicate, Cai Jin exquisite, dozens of students from the Conservatory of Music, there is one called Zhang Hao who is sweating profusely holding a conductor's whip leading the orchestra to sing!

Apart from Li Jinguang, I can't really forget that violinist who has been naturalized in China, that Mr. Mei Xia who is fifty-four years old. That Brahma Forest, the beautiful solo, deeply intoxicated my whole soul.

There is no "Pastoral Song" to listen to in "Song of Shanghai," but when "I Love the Mountains and Rivers of the Motherland" was played, I could understand why the composer had that song. Isn't the occupied "isolated island" still "full of singing"?

A piece of starlight, is the Mid-Autumn Festival that embellishes the "New Capital."

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden: Actors and Opium

— Xu Muyun

In the past and present, many famous actors indulge in opium. The late Mr. Wang, known as Xiao Nong, was particularly addicted. He could smoke two ounces of opium paste daily. It is said that before he would get out of bed, his concubine had to first blow smoke into his face several times while standing beside the bed before he could even begin to stir slightly. A small teapot filled with a little ginseng soup was used to moisten his mouth, and then the prepared opium was fed to him. With his eyes closed, Xiao Nong would inhale a dozen or so puffs before he could slowly open his eyes and speak, put on his clothes, get out of bed, wash his face, and rinse his mouth. Then, he would lie back down and smoke again. When the weather was clear and his spirits were good, he could prepare and smoke the opium himself; otherwise, his concubine would have to do it for him. At this time, he couldn't have breakfast until he had finished dozens of pipes. Therefore, whenever there was a performance at a theater, the owner had to bribe the concubine with a certain amount of money, or she would not be willing to serve him wholeheartedly or urge him to go to the backstage early.

The main reasons why actors are fond of opium are nothing more than the following: (1) It is hereditary. (2) From a young age, they are constantly exposed to it, believing that they cannot become famous actors without smoking it. It is common to see many famous actors lying on the opium couch while teaching their students, instructing them to stand at attention in front of the couch. While teaching the lyrics or correcting a certain melody, their eyes are focused on the lamp, reciting and circling, appearing relaxed and content. When the students memorize the lyrics, they also focus their eyes on it, without glancing away. This is very different from the situation in school classrooms, where the opium couch is like a classroom, the opium tray is like a blackboard, the opium pick is like a teaching whip, and the opium pipe can be used as a handle for swords, spears, or whips. Also, when reciting percussion rhythms, the opium pick can be used to strike the opium tray to represent drums and clappers. Therefore, the teacher teaches lying down, while the student stands respectfully in front of the opium couch to receive instruction. This becomes a habit, and they feel that this way of teaching students is not only very comfortable but also full of style. Once they become a little famous, they cannot help but imitate their teacher's style, acquiring a set of opium paraphernalia and puffing away. It is said that because of the anecdote that Xiao Jiaotian was ordered to smoke opium, it seems that one is not qualified to be called a "Tan School" performer without smoking opium. Therefore, among those who claim to be from the Tan School or disciples of Tan's descendants, I am afraid that ten out of ten are opium addicts. I really can't think of a single one who doesn't smoke. (109)
