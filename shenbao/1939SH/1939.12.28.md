### Tens of Thousands of Japanese Troops Assembled in Southern Guangdong Attacked Northward in Three Routes, All Repelled; Over Fifty Japanese Armored Vehicles Destroyed, Casualties of Soldiers Close to Ten Thousand; Bai Chongxi Tells Reporters That He Will Certainly Be Able to Expel the Japanese Troops from Guangxi

Yingde: Tens of thousands of Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery troops, along with dozens of Japanese aircraft, assembled in southern Guangdong and attacked northward in three routes. One route, with over ten thousand troops, attempted to break through from Yinzhan'ao and advance northward, suffering heavy casualties along the way due to fierce attacks by the Chinese. They once crossed the Pa River but were routed by the Chinese through fierce attacks. Currently, there is no trace of the Japanese on the north bank of the Pa River. Another route, with five to six thousand troops, attacked northward towards Liang Kou, suffering countless casualties after being ambushed by the Chinese near Conghua. They are currently engaged in combat near Liang Kou Market. The Japanese troops, numbering seven to eight thousand, who advanced from Zhengguo towards Longmen, wreaked havoc yesterday, reaching places like Gaotian and Tiegang. After bloody battles by the Chinese army, Japanese corpses littered the fields. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. In total, in recent days, over three thousand Japanese have been killed in this area, with twice as many wounded. Many Japanese have been captured, and countless horses, seventeen machine guns, four cannons, and countless rifles, ammunition, and military supplies have been seized. Additionally, over fifty Japanese armored vehicles have been destroyed. (27th dispatch)

Wengyuan: The Japanese troops on the front line of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway suffered heavy casualties after strong attacks by the Chinese army and failed to achieve their objectives. This morning, under the cover of artillery fire, they attempted to attack Tianxin, which belongs to Qingyuan.

Chongqing: General Bai Chongxi, when hosting reporters from various Chinese newspapers today, stated that although he could not announce military plans, he expressed deep confidence that the Chinese army would expel the Japanese troops from Guangxi Province. He said, "History tells us that no invading army has ever been able to establish a foothold in Guangxi Province." He dared to assert that the Japanese troops in Guangxi would eventually be forced to withdraw. He had previously stated that they were willing to fight the Japanese army in the Pearl River area because the terrain in that area is mountainous, the residents are skilled fighters, and the climate is also favorable to the defending forces. Based on the above factors, he firmly believed that it would not be difficult to defeat the enemy. If the people can cooperate with the army, we will have nothing to fear. Bai concluded by saying that what he said above was not empty comfort, but because he had already determined that the situation would yield favorable results. (27th Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing: News received here from the Chinese side states that a week ago, Japanese infantry, artillery, and cavalry units moved southwest along the highway from Nanning, passing through the towns of Suilu, Sile, and Mingjiang, in an attempt to spy on Longzhou and Zhennanguan to reach the Vietnamese border. After reaching Mingjiang, a detachment of Japanese troops advanced towards the highway south of Longzhou leading to the Vietnamese border, engaging in a major battle near Yachuitan in the suburbs. The Chinese army fought desperately for a day and night, repelling the Japanese troops, killing over a thousand and wounding many more. According to opinions here, the Japanese's fierce attack on Longzhou had two purposes: one was to reach Zhennanguan, an important terminal station on the railway to Hanoi, and the other was to contain the Chinese army attacking Nanning. The Chinese military authorities recently issued a statement saying that after the Japanese army was defeated at Yachuitan, they are now retreating eastward, and the Chinese army is in close pursuit.

Chongqing: A Chinese war correspondent sent a dispatch from the trenches near Kunlun Pass on December 23, stating that this morning, the Chinese army intensified its encirclement near Kunlun Pass. From 9:00 AM to noon, the reporter observed the Chinese army fighting on the front lines north of Kunlun Pass. When the fighting subsided slightly, the reporter rode in a truck along a quiet road towards the Kunlun Pass entrance and arrived at a place where artillery was roaring and the sound of Japanese machine guns was clearly audible. The reporters then got out of the truck and climbed a mountain where the grass was knee-deep and a strong wind blew in their faces, hindering their progress. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, one Chinese army unit advanced northward from Jiutang, while another Chinese army unit advanced southward from Binyang to attack the enemy troops in Kunlun Pass from both sides. Every time the Chinese army captured a hill, they lit beacon fires, and rising smoke was followed by the planting of flags of various colors as signals. At night, brilliant red and green lights were projected into the sky to coordinate the movements of the various units. The reporter saw Chinese tanks circling the roads on the slopes of small hills and highlands, advancing towards the famous Kunlun Pass entrance. Other than that, there was little visible movement of the fighting troops. Japanese military aircraft flew back and forth twice over the reporter's head, but did not drop bombs. Chinese soldiers sat leisurely in the trenches beside the mountain. (27th Reuters dispatch)

### Large Numbers of Japanese Aircraft Attack Lanzhou, Fierce Air Battle Occurs, Three Japanese Aircraft Shot Down, Over Ten Damaged

Lanzhou: From 5:00 AM to noon on the 26th, ninety-nine Japanese aircraft attacked Lanzhou in batches. The first batch consisted of twenty-seven bombers, and the second and third batches each had thirty-six aircraft. They dropped many bombs in the outskirts of Lanzhou, including incendiary bombs and delayed-action explosive bombs. When the Japanese aircraft appeared over Lanzhou, the brave Chinese air force immediately intercepted them with the most fierce offensive. The Japanese aircraft attacked more than five times, and the intensity of the battle was unprecedented. Three Japanese aircraft were shot down on the spot by the Chinese. One of them has been found in Yuzhong County, and the other two are still being searched for. Over ten Japanese aircraft were damaged by the Chinese. All Chinese aircraft returned safely to base. During this large-scale attack on Lanzhou by Japanese aircraft, the people cooperated in defense, rescuing refugees and extinguishing fires with extraordinary speed and effort. Stalls selling cakes and vegetables reappeared among the rubble immediately after the air raid alert was lifted. This proves that the Chinese people are becoming increasingly resilient in the face of bombing. Although Chairman Zhu Shaoliang is unwell, he still directed everything with great effort today and personally went to the disaster area to inspect and comfort the refugees. (26th dispatch)

Lanzhou: This morning, one hundred and one Japanese aircraft, divided into four batches, carried out a planned bombing of Lanzhou for a total of two hours. The material losses suffered by Lanzhou in this determined air raid were even greater than those suffered in the entire month of November, but the loss of life was not great. No foreign missionaries or their staff suffered misfortune during the bombing. According to Chinese sources, at least four of the first wave of attacking Japanese aircraft were shot down by the Chinese. The last wave of Japanese aircraft used mostly incendiary bombs, causing many fires throughout the city. At the same time, because the north wind was very strong, the fires spread uncontrollably. The fire damage in the southern part of the city was the most severe. Fortunately, hundreds of police and soldiers worked hard to extinguish the fires with hand-operated water pumps and by drawing water from the Yellow River. According to reports, the first Japanese raid this morning occurred at 5:30 AM when two Japanese reconnaissance planes appeared over the city. The air raid alert was issued at 6:30 AM, and at 9:30 AM, twenty-seven Japanese bombers, flying from west to east, entered the city airspace. Chinese anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely at them. It was reported that two Japanese aircraft were shot down by the Chinese. Later, another batch of Japanese bombers flew from south to north over the city, hoping to destroy the Yellow River railway bridge built by the Chinese, but they were unsuccessful.

Editorial

### Cabinet Tide in Japan

According to dispatches from Tokyo, two hundred and fifty members of the Japanese House of Representatives held a closed-door meeting yesterday, immediately passing a motion of no confidence in the cabinet and demanding that Prime Minister Abe consider resigning before the National Assembly convenes in January of next year. Although Japanese authorities believe that the nature of the situation is not serious, they are working to eliminate the problem; however, general observations assume that the political upheaval has a distinct possibility of becoming fact.

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese cabinet has been reorganized three times. The Konoe Cabinet, which launched the war of aggression against China, resigned in January of this year, lasting one year and six months. His successor, Hiranuma, was forced to step down less than eight months after taking office. The current Prime Minister Abe formed his cabinet in mid-August and has only been in office for four months. If this tide of no confidence leads to his departure, then the period of time he served is truly getting shorter and shorter. No country will lightly reorganize the government during an external war, because they have to concentrate political power, stabilize the administrative structure, implement policies, and devote all efforts abroad. However, during this war of aggression against China, Japan has repeatedly reorganized its cabinet, which reveals that Japan's political mechanism has exposed its weaknesses, as it has been increasingly bogged down in China. If the war of aggression against China cannot be ended quickly, in the future, there will inevitably be more political changes outside of the ordinary.

The dissolution of the Konoe and Hiranuma cabinets was due to the failure of peace movements and foreign policy failures. Abe came to power with the hopes of saving these two failures, but in reality, he has completely disappointed the Japanese. To end the war of aggression against China, he wanted to use political offensives, but he did not achieve as much success as Konoe and Hiranuma. He wanted to continue to exert military force, but he was defeated in northern Hunan, and after invading Nanning, he was still at a loss, and he had to watch as tens of thousands of soldiers were gradually wiped out. In addition, China's recent all-out counterattack has caused panic throughout Japan's front line. Not only was the war not ended, but the scope of the war was further expanded and weakened. Speaking of adjusting diplomacy, since the United States announced the abolition of the current US-Japan Commerce Treaty in late July, it also caused changes in the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin negotiations, and Abe and Nomura were unable to find a way to break the deadlock. Although there was an attempt to vigorously stir up the air of improved relations between Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom internationally, the British and American governments did not provide reliable guarantees. The authorities expressed their empty promises, revealing weaknesses at home, and earning ridicule abroad. Therefore, since the establishment of the Abe Cabinet, it has not only been loved by the military, but also not been praised by political parties. People often ridiculed it as a weak and incompetent cabinet; it was destined to be rejected. Not long ago, it was rumored that Japanese party politics was about to rise. Although whether the political parties can rise up is a major problem, it can be regarded as a prelude to the collapse of the Abe Cabinet.

The reason for launching this no-confidence motion is said to be dissatisfaction with commodity prices and rice policies. On the surface, it seems to be different from the previous two cabinet tides, which were internal problems rather than external relations, but it is actually doubtful whether this is really the case. Even if this is entirely an internal problem, it is closely related to the war of aggression against China. Because the continuation of the war, the so-called wartime economic system, has forced all industries to decline, and most people are suffering from hunger and cold. All industrial and commercial controls only facilitate a small number of large capitalists and arms manufacturers, while most handicraftsmen and small-capital producers have mostly fallen into bankruptcy. In terms of prices, although the government has very good control figures, the prices on the black market are often several times higher than those stipulated by the government. In terms of rice, the government once claimed that the quantity of production had increased and that it could be exported in large quantities, but now it has caused dissatisfaction among the people. If the reasons put forward by the members of the House of Representatives are really the natural result of the members of the National Assembly personally witnessing the current situation in the electoral districts, as the Asahi Shimbun said, then the war has caused Japanese society to fall into widespread and major unrest, which is the most conclusive and powerful evidence.

Japan's financial, material, and human resources are insufficient to support a long-term war. This is a well-known fact; given the current world situation and China's determination to resist, Japan's hope of gaining an unexpected harvest by chance is also something that is not allowed by the facts. Therefore, no matter how Japan reorganizes its cabinet, no matter who is the prime minister, if it does not fundamentally change the established national policy and abandon its ambitions of aggression, it will not be able to solve political problems or stabilize society. The unsoundness of Japanese political parties, the lack of visionary and capable personnel who can be political leaders, and the courage to publicly and sincerely change the national policy are its fatal flaws. Perhaps it will have to wait until the political upheavals continue until the end of the road, and then there will be hope of a hero being created by the times!

### Over Two Hundred Members of Japanese Parties Demand Resignation of Abe Cabinet, Reason for Opposing Commodity Prices and Rice Policies, Cabinet Members Attempt to Eliminate the No-Confidence Motion

Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister General Abe Nobuyuki today received the request passed yesterday by two hundred and forty members of the Japanese House of Representatives, expressing a vote of no confidence in the cabinet and suggesting that the cabinet resign. The reason for the no-confidence motion was "dissatisfaction with commodity prices and rice policies." After the parliament adjourns today, cabinet members will hold a long-term informal meeting, and politicians will try to prevent the spread of the no-confidence motion before the parliament reconvenes on January 20 next year. The government authorities do not view the current situation as serious, but if the movement of dissatisfaction with the cabinet expands, the cabinet will be forced to submit a general resignation. The cabinet feels that the current movement of dissatisfaction is unorganized, so it plans to work hard to prevent the union of the opposition parties. Akita Kiyoshi, Minister of Communications Nagai Ryutaro, and Minister of Colonial Affairs Kanemitsu Yonefu, who are related to the parliament, are mediating to eliminate the no-confidence motion. (27th United Press dispatch)

Tokyo: Japanese political parties have launched a drumbeat for the government to resign. Two hundred and fifty members of five parties in the lower house passed a motion at a closed-door meeting yesterday, demanding that the cabinet consider resigning before the National Assembly reconvenes on January 21. This morning, almost all newspapers published this news. The Kokumin Shimbun openly claimed that the political parties believed that the cabinet had made mistakes more than once and had lost the trust of the people of the country, and that this emotion was becoming increasingly strong. The Yomiuri Shimbun said that there will be a storm in the parliament, and the sentiment against the government may reach the point of fatally hitting the government. The Asahi Shimbun said that this movement was not initiated by political planners, but was a natural result of members of the National Assembly personally witnessing the correct current situation in the electoral districts. (27th Reuters dispatch)

Hong Kong: A dispatch from Tokyo states that yesterday the Asahi Shimbun's prediction that the Abe Cabinet's credibility could be rebuilt due to the improvement of the domestic and foreign situation, etc., has now been contradicted by the facts. The reason for this is that yesterday afternoon, two hundred and fifty members of various parties in the House of Representatives (with a total of four hundred and sixty-six members) held a special meeting in the parliament after the parliament adjourned yesterday and passed a resolution expressing a vote of no confidence in the Abe Cabinet. The full text of the resolution stated, "(The Cabinet bears the important responsibility of assisting the Emperor in handling state affairs. We hope that the Abe Cabinet will consider whether it should still deliver the resolution at the official residence and advise Abe to resign.)" The government authorities were extremely anxious after learning about the members' opposition demonstration. Currently, the cabinet is also being疏通 by the vice ministers and councilors of the cabinet who belong to political parties. Prime Minister Abe visited Minister of the Interior Yunari at 11:15 this morning and held a secret talk for more than an hour. The Mainichi Shimbun commented on the current political situation, saying that although the crowd of two hundred and fifty members who do not trust Abe's cabinet has not yet been proposed in the parliament, it is undoubtedly necessary for the government to pay close attention to it. Since the leaders of the five parties have guaranteed to support the cabinet, the goal of this move is not only to attack the Abe Cabinet, but also to attack the leaders of the political parties. The current situation is extremely serious, and people in the country should step up preparations to avoid repeating the mistakes of short-lived cabinets. Especially when the Abe Cabinet is dealing with the food and fuel issues, it should make every effort to stop the collapse of the cabinet. (27th dispatch)

Tokyo: In order to implement a policy of reducing commodity prices, the Japanese government formally decided to lower the price of salt at a general meeting of government and central price committee members on the 27th, and decided to implement it from January 1 next year. (27th Domei dispatch)

### US Congressional Leaders Prepare to Study Policy Towards Japan; US Government May Negotiate with Japan on Transitional Measures After the Expiration of the Trade Treaty

Washington – Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is expected to arrive here today to prepare for the opening of Congress. He will study measures to impose an embargo on the export of munitions and raw materials to Japan. According to the most impartial observers here, the nation has not yet decided on its attitude toward imposing an embargo on munitions and raw materials to Japan. Therefore, there is general expectation that any request from the government will be decided by Congress regarding future policy. They anticipate that Congress will generally decide against enacting broad-based legislation to prohibit the export of munitions and raw materials to Japan under the current circumstances and will not be willing to pass an unrestricted embargo. However, Congress may pass a measure to impose a limited embargo on military materials such as scrap iron, octane, gasoline, kerosene, munitions, and manufacturing machinery to Japan. The passage of a limited embargo is intended solely to aid the United States in implementing it in the event of failed negotiations with Japan. It is generally predicted that if US-Japan negotiations proceed smoothly, Congress will not take any immediate steps but will prepare to implement them if necessary. Observers at this time deeply believe that when the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce expires next month, the State Department will not continue trade with Japan according to the current method in order to restrain itself. If Japan can satisfy the United States, the US government may negotiate transitional measures with Japan to continue trade, but it is reported that the transitional measures can be cancelled at any time after a short period of notice. If the US government cancels these transitional trade measures in the future, it can replace them with embargoes and other punitive measures. (United Press, 27th)

Tokyo – Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma stated that because the US government announced that commerce and shipping would continue, "the terror caused by the treaty-less situation will be eliminated." However, he still strongly hopes that residential rights can be obtained through temporary measures. "I hope that both sides will adjust relations through a legal status, at least for one year. I still hope that this legal status can be established between the two countries." (United Press, 27th)

Manila – The Manila News commented today on the statement made by Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi to reporters that future new commercial relations between the US and Japan would depend on the Japanese army in China. It stated that, according to the ambassador's words, it is tantamount to admitting that present-day Japan has two governments, one being the military rule in China and the other being the civilian diplomatic rule in Tokyo. If what Horinouchi said is not the case, then it is clearly an action by the Japanese government to shirk responsibility and delay time. (United Press, 27th)

Tokyo – Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma denied this morning, when receiving newspaper reporters, the statement in the Yomiuri Shimbun today that Foreign Minister Nomura reported to the cabinet that US Ambassador Grew had stated to Japan that the United States did not want a treaty-less state between the two countries. According to Suma, he did not know of anything that could prove the news reported by the Yomiuri Shimbun. He believed that the newspaper's report that there was such a situation between the Soviet Union, Japan, and the United States was premature. He did not wish to continue discussing this matter, as it would only continue to cause misunderstandings. Although a certain foreign reporter stated that there was clearly a misunderstanding regarding whether the US ambassador had guaranteed that a treaty-less situation would not arise between the US and Japan, the spokesman still held the view that continuing the discussion would only increase misunderstandings. Reuters heard that it was very doubtful whether the US ambassador had issued the above guarantee. (Reuters, 27th)

Tokyo – When Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma received newspaper reporters this morning, he was asked whether the proposed "New Central Government" of China would be established before the reopening of the Yangtze River. If it was established, would it be hoped that Washington would consult with the new regime? The spokesman replied that the Japanese government hoped that the new regime would be established first, but Japan had already formulated measures for the reopening of the Yangtze River and would soon make a decision on its own. He predicted that the United States "may" have the "necessity" to consult with the new Chinese regime on some minor issues. In response to another question, the spokesman said that he believed that the Reuters report that the Japanese ambassador to the United States, Horinouchi, said that concessions made by Tokyo for the negotiation of a new US-Japan commercial treaty had to be approved by the Japanese military authorities in China was a misunderstanding. (Reuters, 27th)

### US Conducts Commercial Negotiations with Various Countries; Considerable Progress Made in Negotiations with Argentina

Washington – State Department Director Grady recently gave an interview to a Havas reporter, saying that President Roosevelt convened a meeting this morning and decided to launch a movement to support Secretary of State Hull's proposed commercial negotiation plan. Of the commercial treaty negotiations that the United States is currently conducting with various countries, only two have not yet been concluded. The negotiations with Argentina are progressing smoothly, and the rest have been concluded. (Havas, 26th)

Washington – Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that recently the public has been increasingly critical of the government's commencement of negotiations with the Argentine government on a reciprocal trade treaty, so he welcomes the public's investigation of the government's reciprocal trade treaty procedures. Hull issued the above statement because Michigan Republican Senator Vandenberg, who is also a member of the Senate Finance Committee, stated that he would authorize the government to thoroughly study the procedures before the current treaty expires next June. Hull stated, "We welcome the investigation. If the purpose of the investigation is to obtain information, the more detailed the investigation, the more satisfied those who support the program to restore our agricultural, commercial, and industrial sectors will be."

U Ba Lwin accepted on behalf of the delegation and delivered a reply speech, briefly stating that the relationship between China and Myanmar is like that of mother and child, and that it will become even closer due to increased transportation convenience. Currently, overseas Chinese in Myanmar still refer to each other as "compatriots," which shows that friendly relations between the two countries have long been established on a good foundation. Our delegation is very grateful for the warm welcome from your country during this visit to China. We hope that people from your country will often travel to Myanmar in the future, and our country will welcome you very much.

Well-informed sources stated that the agreement was negotiated by Vatican Secretary of State Maglione and Italian Ambassador to the Vatican Alfieri. It is reported that the Pope plans to personally visit various Italian churches next spring to increase the relationship between the Vatican and Italy. At this time, the Pope is providing economic assistance to Finnish churches, which is being distributed by the Archbishop of Helsinki. (United Press, 27th)

Rome – The King of Italy yesterday telegraphed Vatican Secretary of State Maglione, announcing the awarding of the Annunziata Medal. The medal is the highest-level medal in Italy, and those who receive it are considered to be cousins of the King of Italy. (Haitong, 27th)

Vatican – Pope Pius XII today awarded Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano the Order of the Golden Spur in recognition of his merits in political and religious relations. (Haitong, 27th)

### English Newspapers Praise the Pope's Remarks

London – The speeches delivered by Pope Pius XII to the Cardinals on the eve of Christmas have been unanimously praised by newspapers here. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that what the Pope said was neither dreaming of peace during peacetime, nor accommodating any solution regardless of right and wrong. For the Pope to sternly condemn the authorities of a certain country and express his views on international issues in clear terms is something rarely seen in many years and will certainly cause a major impact on worldwide public opinion. The "Times" correspondent in Rome reported that after President Roosevelt sent a letter to the Pope and the Pope delivered a speech, some quarters in Italy had the impression that peace proposals could be put forward in a short period of time, which was completely wrong. "As seen by the general public in Italy, the speeches delivered by the Pope are a stern reprimand to Germany and the Soviet Union, and at the same time, they express approval for the war aims of Britain, France, and Poland, as well as the policies promoted by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini." (Havas, 27th)

### German Submarine Sinks British Ship; Fourteen Crew Members Killed

London – The British ship "Stanholm" (2473 tons) was sunk yesterday off the west coast of Germany by a German submarine without warning. Fourteen people were killed, and the rest were injured. The ship's deckhand caught a glimpse of the German submarine, but it was too late to sound the alarm. According to a rescued person, he saw two submarines. The British ship did not receive its warning, nor did it have time to launch lifeboats. The crew jumped into the sea, and some managed to climb onto a small boat and were subsequently rescued. (Reuters, 27th)

### British Aircraft Reconnoiter the North Sea

### Great Success in British and French Naval Cooperation; Able to Completely Control All Sea Areas; Britain Decides to Lay New Mine Networks in the North Sea

London – Observers here recently commented that the various facts during the week before Christmas show that the British and French navies have been able to completely control all sea areas. Although the British air and naval forces are independent units and are not connected, the results of their close cooperation have achieved great success. For example, after British aircraft repeatedly attacked the German naval base of Heligoland, German warships did not dare to sail out of the base. This is a great contribution to the British and French fleets. When the 1st Canadian Expeditionary Division dispatched by the Canadian Confederation crossed the Atlantic Ocean and arrived at British ports, German warships did not dare to come out and attack them, which is clear evidence of this. As for repeated formal naval battles, naval experts all say that British warships are superior to German warships in terms of gunnery firepower or defensive power, which is already undoubtedly confirmed. The defeat of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" by British warships with smaller tonnage and weaker firepower is one example. The successive sinking of German cruisers by the British submarines "Ursula" and "Salmon" is another. Among them, the "Ursula" submarine's penetration deep into the mine network near the mouth of the German Elbe River, crossing the defensive line of six German destroyers, and sinking an enemy "Köln" class cruiser is most praised by the general public. Furthermore, the "Salmon"'s respect for international naval warfare regulations after glimpsing the German mail ship "Bremen" and allowing it to escape further proves that the actions of the British Navy abide by international law. (Havas, 26th)

London – The Admiralty has decided to lay new mine networks in the North Sea. The proposed plan has been published by the "News Chronicle," briefly stating that there are already three mine networks off the British coast, and their areas are not very large. One is off Flamborough Head in the north, 85 miles long and 20 miles deep. The second is off the mouth of the Thames River. The third is in the English Channel. In the future, the Admiralty will lay new mine networks in the eastern sea, 8 miles offshore, from Kinnaird Head in Scotland in the north to the mouth of the Thames River in the south, 500 miles long and 30-40 miles deep. All ships from Sweden, Norway, and Denmark must bypass the northern end of the mine network, and those from Belgium and the Netherlands must bypass the southern end of the mine network at the mouth of the Thames River. In this way, ships passing through the eastern sea of Britain must travel within a sea area only 8 miles wide. British naval authorities will send a large number of warships to patrol this sea area more closely in order to prevent the activities of German submarines. At the same time, if German seaplanes want to drop magnetic mines in this sea area, it will be difficult for them to escape the interception of the British air and naval forces, because the scope of navigation in the sea has been reduced, and patrolling and defense can be more effective. (Havas, 27th)

### French Naval Commander's Address to Officers and Soldiers

Paris – French Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Darlan has issued a letter to naval officers and soldiers, reiterating his confidence that the Allied nations of Britain and France will win the final victory. It reads, "It has been four months since the start of the war. Our naval officers and soldiers know to calmly fight and fulfill their responsibilities, and they can fully understand the importance of naval activities. This is gratifying. Our country's navy, in close cooperation with the brave British fleet, has ensured that the overseas transportation of the French Empire is unimpeded, and the resources of the entire world can still be taken for our use. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the naval officers and soldiers who died on ships or in air battles. At the same time, I extend my warmest congratulations to all the officers and soldiers of our navy. At this time of the New Year, all naval comrades should believe that spiritual power is unbreakable, so the final victory must belong to us." (Havas, 26th)

### Soviet Troops Use Airplanes and Artillery to Fiercely Bomb Finnish Cities; Viipuri Industrial Zone Suffers Heaviest Bombing; Finnish Troops on Eastern Front Still Hold Defensive Line

Helsinki – Yesterday marked the twenty-first day of heavy Soviet artillery bombardment against the sixty-mile-long Karelian Isthmus Finnish defensive line. As of now, Finnish troops are still holding this rugged, heavily forested isthmus area in temperatures of ten degrees below zero. Although reporters are twenty miles away from the front line, they can still hear the rumbling of Soviet artillery fire, and the air is also vibrating. Most obviously, the Soviet Red Army seems determined to raze the city of Viipuri to the ground. Soviet aircraft have been bombing Viipuri for three days, and on the fourth day, the Soviets followed up with eight-inch caliber heavy artillery with a range of twenty miles, firing at Viipuri and its surroundings. Viipuri is usually a prosperous industrial city with a population of about 80,000. Yesterday the weather was clear, and Soviet aircraft were very active. Forty planes came to bomb Viipuri in five waves, two of which were for reconnaissance, but the latter three were purely for bombing. However, the population of the city has been evacuated, so although Soviet aircraft dropped twenty-five bombs, only two civilians were killed, and many residences and hotels were destroyed. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Oslo – In northern Finland, heavy snow has halted fighting in recent days, especially in Petsamo, where the temperature has dropped to thirty degrees below zero. Russian troops are holding their positions to avoid the severe cold, so there has been no contact. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)

Moscow – The Leningrad Military District Headquarters issued a communiqué stating that on December 26, there were only small clashes and artillery battles by reconnaissance teams on the front line, and Soviet aircraft conducted reconnaissance flights. (TASS dispatch, 27th)

Helsinki – According to a detailed Finnish communiqué on the fighting on December 25, Christmas Day was unfavorable to Soviet troops within Finland. On that day, Soviet aircraft lost at least twenty-three or twenty-six planes in a few hours, five of which were shot down by coastal artillery in the Gulf of Finland, four were destroyed by coastal warships, and four were shot down by artillery on Lake Ladoga. At the same time, the Soviet offensive on the Karelian Isthmus was completely repulsed by Finnish troops. The Soviets suffered heavy losses. The Soviet army launched a major offensive against the Suvanto Lake area, hoping to cross the lake at four key points, under the cover of tanks, artillery, and aircraft, but Finnish artillery fire was fierce, and the Soviets failed. In this battle, Finnish troops captured sixty machine guns, five rapid-firing guns, destroyed two tanks, and captured fifty enemy soldiers. There were seven hundred Soviet soldiers' corpses on the ice of Lake Suvanto. Finnish troops also won the battle on the eastern front on Christmas Day. In patrol and artillery battles, Finnish troops destroyed twenty enemy trucks and two tanks. Soviet aircraft dropped bombs on various coastal fortifications on the eastern front on Christmas Day.

This was the first time since 1918 that Hitler had set foot on French soil. He did not leave until the church bells rang in the villages at 5 p.m. Hitler disguised himself as an ordinary private during this inspection, and frontline sergeants did not notice. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Stockholm – Reports state that Germany spent a quiet Christmas Day without any war news. It was only reported that British aircraft attacked Wilhelmshaven on Christmas Eve. Hitler spent the holiday with a staff officer at the front. Hitler traveled back and forth on a heavily guarded armored train, and his whereabouts were kept secret. He is expected to return to Berlin soon. According to an official news agency, Hitler crossed the border en route to somewhere in Lorraine, three miles south of Saarbrücken, and promoted the captain defending that line to major. During this trip, Hitler promoted many officers with merit and also gave many gifts to soldiers. The Pope's peace appeal has attracted much attention among the German people, who hope that the Pope's actions will be effective, as the German people still hope to turn swords into ploughshares.

The German ships were all scuttled by themselves. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

### Australia Implements Grand Plan; Manufacturing Weapons and Building Air Force; Becoming the Future Armory of the British Empire in the Far East

London – According to well-informed sources today, Australia's air force construction plan and other munitions manufacturing plans can make Australia the future armory of the British Empire in the Far East. The Australian government plans to have its aircraft factories employ 8,000 to 10,000 workers by 1941. The aircraft that Australian arsenals plan to manufacture include not only Australian designs, but also all British Bristol and Beaufort bombers and trainers from the American North American Aviation Company. At the same time, the aircraft factory established by the Australian government in Sydney will manufacture Pratt & Whitney engines to be used to manufacture British Beaufort bombers. In addition to this, Australia is currently engaged in the manufacture of coastal patrol corvettes and minesweeping submarines. Moreover, during the last war, Australia could only manufacture rifles and bullets, but at present, it can manufacture heavy artillery, field guns, tanks, hand grenades, bombs, and shells. As for Australia's role in the Dominion Air Training Plan, it is to train 10,400 aircraft pilots and 15,600 air force machine gunners and reconnaissance personnel. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

### Germany and the Soviet Union Establish Agreement; Launching Scheduled Air Service; Railway Traffic Between the Two Countries Reportedly Restored; Economic Negotiations Underway in Moscow

Moscow – The Soviet Union and Germany have concluded an agreement to launch a scheduled air service for mail and passengers between Moscow and Berlin, scheduled to begin on January 3. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Paris – Railway traffic between Germany and the Soviet Union, which has been suspended for several months, will be reopened in certain cities bordering Poland after representatives from both sides signed an agreement on the 24th of this month. Traffic has been restored since yesterday. French observers are commenting on this matter, stating that some of Germany's goods have always been exported via the Danube River, but now the river is frozen, and most of the ships sailing on the Danube belong to Britain and France, which Germany can no longer use. Therefore, this export route has been lost. Even if it can take the route through the Soviet Union in the future, it will not be worth the loss. As for the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, so far, the assistance provided by the Soviet Union to Germany has not been as expected by Germany. However, since the Red Army's offensive against Finland has been repeatedly frustrated, the Soviet Union is no longer in the position of a pure supplier to Germany, and it also has requests from Germany. It is reported that Germany will supply the Soviet Union with machines for refining synthetic oil. If so, then the oil produced by the Soviet Union may not even be enough for its own use, and it will have to use synthetic methods to make up for it. Therefore, the Soviet Union's need for Germany may be greater than Germany's expectations of the Soviet Union, and it can be said that the relationship between the two sides will enter a new stage. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Paris – A German economic delegation is currently in Moscow, continuing negotiations with Soviet government authorities. The Soviet side has asked Germany to supply blueprints for the construction of new-style artillery. The German delegation was surprised that the Soviet Union was aware of this, as this type of artillery is being manufactured in secret. The effectiveness of Soviet spies can be seen here. Although economic negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union are still ongoing, there is mutual suspicion between the two sides, and the future is uncertain. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

### Armory Robbed in Dublin; Done by the South Irish Republican Army

London – On the 24th of this month, the Irish Republican Army of South Dublin, Ireland, broke into an armory in Phoenix Park and stole some military supplies. Today, a large number of troops are on alert around Dublin, believed to be searching for the stolen military supplies. Public buses entering the city are being stopped, and passengers carrying small boxes or packages are asked to open them for inspection. Private cars, motorcycles, bicycles, and farm vehicles are also being inspected. Searches are also being conducted in several other areas. Police discovered a ton of stolen bullets near Kildare Heath, four miles from Dublin, yesterday. It is reported that the stolen military supplies, even if not unusable, are of poor quality. Four people were arrested in Phoenix Park after the armory was robbed, but no one else has been arrested since. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Soviet Newspaper Comments; German Ship Scuttled; Should Not Be Seen as a British Victory

Moscow – Regarding the self-sinking of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee," the "Red Fleet Newspaper," the organ of the People's Commissariat for the Navy, commented that "The sinking of the ship cannot be seen as a victory for the British fleet, but rather as a reflection of the incompetence of the British Navy. About ten British warships searched the Atlantic for a month and a half before finally and accidentally encountering the German ship. Therefore, in reality, the ship was scuttled because the Uruguayan government refused to extend its anchorage permit, and not because it was unable to break through a tight British naval blockade." (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Buenos Aires – The five British captains and five thousand sailors previously captured by the German pocket battleship "Spee" (each of these British ships was sunk by the "Spee") have been released by the Uruguayan authorities and boarded a British ship yesterday to return to their country. In addition, the officers of the "Spee" requested that the Argentine authorities confine the sailors in one place and still allow German officers to manage them, but the Argentine authorities decided to send each of the sailors to various places to work and not to be subject to military law. On the other hand, the German government intends to assign the officers of the "Spee" to serve as naval attachés in the German embassies in various Latin American countries, and the German ambassador informed the Argentine government of this intention, but it has been rejected.

### Belgian Cabinet; About to Be Reorganized; Left and Right Wings Heavily Dispute Wartime Economic Policy

Brussels – Belgian newspapers report that the Belgian government will be reorganized soon. The current cabinet's difficulties are well known, as its formation was very difficult from the beginning. Later, Minister of Transportation Marc and Minister of Information Wouters both had incidents and expressed negativity, and the miners' strike in the Walloon region is generally considered a fatal blow to the government. However, the most important issue that has caused the government and the two houses of parliament to split is the dispute between the left and right wings over economic policy. At today's meeting, the Senate mostly disapproved of the war profits tax implemented by the government. The right wing of the Catholic Party is strongly opposed, and the Liberal senators will also vote against it. It is difficult to predict the direction of the Belgian government after the reorganization. Approximately the number of members (currently eighteen) will definitely be reduced, and Prime Minister Pierlot may leave the cabinet. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)

### Belgian Miners' Strike Expands

### Song Hanzhang and Ye Zhuotang; Call on Chiang Kai-shek to Pay Respects

Chongqing – Since the reorganization of the Joint Office of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China, financial leaders have come to Chongqing one after another to assist the leaders and plan the direction of the Joint Office.

He has been consistent for decades and has an outstanding reputation. He is now sixty-eight years old and as strong as ever, but his hearing is slightly impaired. Song and Ye paid respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek yesterday and reported on the financial and economic situation. The Chairman inquired in detail and expressed his satisfaction. (Dispatch, 27th)

### A Certain Military Expert Discusses; Chinese Army's War Record

Linchuan – A certain military observer recently told reporters that in the past two weeks, the Chinese army has launched attacks, including over thirty ambushes and over ten encounters. The Japanese have suffered over 2,500 casualties and over ten prisoners have been captured. Over ten light and heavy machine guns and hundreds of rifles have been seized. The Japanese army's strength has been accurately assessed, and it can be said that the Japanese soldiers' combat skills and morale are worse than before. He also told reporters about the combat exploits of a Long-surnamed soldier of a certain unit of the Chinese army on the west bank of Liangjiadu. This soldier fought four Japanese soldiers alone, stabbing two to death and injuring two. His legs were also severely injured by stabs, but he still crawled back to his team in high spirits. Chinese soldiers fight so bravely, and if we use this to attack the Japanese, how can we not win? (Dispatch, 26th)

### Special Inspection; For Goods Entering and Leaving War Zones

Chongqing – It was announced here today that the National Government has decided to establish a special inspection office to inspect goods transported into the war zones in order to curb the smuggling of goods from the occupied areas into the free areas. In the past year, the number of Japanese goods imported into the free areas has been very large, and many were imported through Hankou and Yichang. It is reported that the Japanese authorities provide various conveniences for those who smuggle goods from Hankou into Sichuan. Large-scale smuggling has caused China to lose a huge amount of tax revenue and has allowed Japanese goods to be widely sold in the Chinese interior. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Disrupting the Rice Market Has Been Punished, A Large Shipment of Foreign Rice Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Trading Above the Price Limit Confirmed, Admission Permits Revoked After Interrogation, The Coarse Grains and Soybean Rice Industries Jointly Commit to a Rice Fund of 100,000 Yuan

In recent years, the source of domestic rice in this city has decreased due to special circumstances. However, foreign rice imports have been continuous. Due to the tight foreign exchange, prices have not fallen. Yesterday, a large quantity of foreign rice was imported from Saigon on the "Yishukang Tilaichai" (transliteration) ship, carrying 4,400 tons, totaling 40,382 bags. The ship arrived at 6:30 AM yesterday and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. It is reported that the foreign rice was handled by Da Fu, He Yi, Da Yuan, and Da Yi Trading Companies. Furthermore, the Taikoo Company's Chongqing vessel also brought 21,305 bags from Saigon, and the Jardine Matheson's Chunsheng vessel brought 8,937 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The two ships arrived in port successively yesterday afternoon and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf in Xinkaihe for unloading. A total of 70,624 bags arrived yesterday. It is reported that there are still over 100,000 bags expected to arrive in Shanghai in about two weeks.

Punishments Increased for Exceeding Price Limits

After the Public Concession and French Concession stipulated price limits for rice (i.e., Japonica rice should not exceed 40 yuan, and Indica rice should not exceed 33 yuan), in addition to ordering strict enforcement and cracking down on speculation and hoarding, special officers were also dispatched to supervise buying and selling on-site. It was reported that brokers Yang Xiling, Huang Renjie, and Sun Yigu of the Qinyi Rice Store had exceeded the price limits in the market. After verification, they were summoned to the police station the day before yesterday and were given the punishment of revoking their tea house market admission permits, which prohibited them from entering the market for business. After being reprimanded, they were released that evening. Now, the Market Management Committee, after receiving notification from the authorities, has stopped them from entering the market for trading.

Rice Registration Started Yesterday

After the Shanghai Civil Food Adjustment Association announced the method for registering for foreign rice on behalf, registration started yesterday. Any organizations, institutions, companies, or factories wishing to order foreign rice can apply for registration at Room 304, 59 Hong Kong Road. Yesterday, over 70 companies, including the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association, the British Shanghai Electric Tramways, insurance, national medicine, and rubber industry associations, requested forms from the association. However, those applying to register for foreign rice must pay a deposit of 20 yuan per bag, and the receiving agency is the Trust Department of Jin Cheng Bank. Once a sufficient amount has accumulated, a purchasing committee will be sent to order from overseas.

Inviting All Industries to Solicit Donations for a Fund

After the Civil Food Adjustment Association passed the method for raising funds, it stipulated that the fund should be 1 million yuan in national currency. After Chairman Yu Qiaqing invited leaders from various industries to solicit donations, 520,000 yuan has been committed by various industries. For the remaining amount, it has been decided to find ways to solicit donations. It is reported that the association has decided to convene another meeting of various industries that have not yet committed funds on the 29th (Friday) to make efforts to solicit donations, aiming to reach the goal of 1 million yuan. The agencies designated to receive the funds are Jin Cheng Bank, Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Fuyuan Money Shop, and Tongrun Money Shop. Furthermore, the association has scheduled its first executive board meeting on the 30th (Saturday).

Coarse Grains Industry Discusses Participating in Rice Purchase

The Shanghai Coarse Grains, Oil Cake Industry Association held a joint meeting of the third executive and supervisory committee at its association hall at 15 Edward Road at 3 PM yesterday. Chen Ziyi, Song Zixiang, Zhu Xiangsheng, He Xianggu, Yu Bingwen, Chen Yunqing, He Quansheng, Yan Xiaoquan, Chen Shide, Fu Changyu, and Chairman Chen Ziyi were present. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting and the urgent need to purchase rice as a group to increase reserves. Immediately, discussions began. In order to raise funds to order foreign rice, it was decided to appoint solicitation committee members to facilitate the process. It was resolved that the association and the Soybean Rice Industry Association would jointly raise 100,000 yuan in national currency. Chen Yuming, He Quansheng, Chen Yunqing, Zheng Zenan, He Xianggu, Chen Shide, and 11 others were appointed as solicitation committee members, forming the solicitation committee. It was also decided to convene a joint meeting with the solicitation committee of the Soybean Rice Industry Association at 3 PM on the 29th of this month. The meeting adjourned at around 5 PM. The solicitation committee members of the Soybean Rice Industry Association have also been appointed, including Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Xing Zhigang, Fu Qiangeng, Yan Jiyun, Jiang Hongbin, Wang Tianchou, Wang Zhihe, Zhou Zhizhen, Gu Yisheng, Zhu Yuanchang, Yu Bingwen, Fang Kunquan, and Jiang Lansheng.

### British Ambassador to China Cole Will Go to Chongqing, Will Fly From Hong Kong to Chongqing at the End of the Year to Meet With Authorities, Some Say the Counselor May Go Instead

British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr returned to Shanghai from Chongqing via Hong Kong on the 13th of last month, aboard the Queen of Asia. Ambassador's Secretary, Mr. Beall, also came with him. After arriving in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 15th, the Ambassador met with Japanese Envoy Kato and also met with the U.S. Ambassador, who arrived in Shanghai on the evening of November 20th. Ambassador Cole also attended a banquet of the Royal Aeronautical Society. It is now learned that the British Ambassador will fly from Hong Kong to Chongqing again at the end of this year to pay respects to the central authorities and handle routine official business. One theory is that the Ambassador may not leave Shanghai and instead have Counselor Broadmead represent him in contacting the National Government.

### Underwear Company Strike Unresolved

Workers at the China Underwear Company's Kang Nao Tuo Road weaving and dyeing factory went on strike from the day before yesterday to demand increased wages, and put forward eight demands. After sending representatives to request the employer, the factory agreed to increase meal subsidies by 15 cents per person, and workers' wages could also be appropriately increased. However, regarding the request to abolish the four-month bonus for male workers and the two-month bonus for female workers in previous years, the factory stated that it could not accept this under the current business conditions. They notified the workers yesterday morning and advised them to resume work. The workers believe that the employer's response is far from their demands and they are not satisfied. Therefore, as of yesterday, the strike is continuing and has not been resolved. According to the company, the strike at the factory only involves the weaving section, with about a thousand workers. The other two departments, bleaching and dyeing, and sewing, are still working as usual.

### Police Arrest Thugs, Puppet Police Coerce Release, A Chinese Man Was Abducted on Baker Road, The Car Was Found to Belong to Nishihara

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that before Christmas, armed Japanese special agents kidnapped a Chinese man in the Public Concession. Yesterday (the 26th) night, another thug, carrying the handgun used to assassinate Wu Mulan last Friday, was arrested by the Public Concession police but was forced to be released by the Dadao Police. Furthermore, a definitive connection has been found between the abduction of Huang XiongLue on Shanzhong Road and the recent assassination of Ms. Mao Liying on Nanjing Road. The details are as follows:

Before Christmas Eve

At 11:15 PM, a Chinese constable on duty near the intersection of Baker Road and Park Road suddenly heard a shout. He rushed towards the sound and discovered five or six plainclothes Japanese men, three of whom were armed, holding a struggling Chinese man. The Chinese constable drew his gun to stop them and looked around for other constables. The Japanese men seized the opportunity to pull out their guns and threatened the Chinese constable, then dragged

The Abducted Chinese Man

Into a car waiting by the road. The car's license plate was 5951, and the registered owner was Nishihara, who lives at 422 Tianzhong Road. It is widely believed that he is connected to the Japanese intelligence department. The name of the abducted Chinese man has not yet been confirmed. The Japanese authorities are currently cooperating with the Public Concession Police Department to thoroughly investigate the matter. However, what Nishihara has

said about the Abduction Incident

Is still unknown. The incident between the Dadao Police and the Public Concession constables occurred near the intersection of Great Western Road and Dunxin Road last night. Four Chinese constables saw four Chinese men running and ordered them to stop with their guns. They noticed one of the Chinese men throwing an object into the roadside. Three of the four men escaped, and the fourth man, seeing the constables following closely, surrendered. As the four constables

Escorted the Arrested Man

They encountered a large contingent of Dadao Police who had arrived after hearing the news. After inspecting the arrested Chinese man, the Dadao Police claimed that they knew him and forced the Chinese constables to release him. The four Chinese constables were surrounded by the Dadao Police. Overwhelmed, they had to release the arrested man.

A Few Minutes Later

The Chinese constables searched for the object abandoned by the arrested man and discovered it was an automatic pistol. Gun experts at the police headquarters immediately confirmed that the gun was the one used to snipe Wu Mulan at the Huabei Apartment on Malan Road last Friday.

### Track Destroyed Near Pingwang, The Suzhou-Jiaxing Passenger Train Delayed, Impossible to Repair Immediately

According to reliable sources in the transportation industry, Chinese army guerrilla mobile units have been quite active along the Jinghu and Huhu-Hangzhou railway lines recently. Many sections of the track not far from Pingwang Station were suddenly destroyed. As a result, the passenger train from Suzhou-Jiaxing to Shanghai was delayed until 4:50 PM yesterday before arriving at the North Station, a delay of three hours and twenty minutes. Some passengers reported that the track near Pingwang Station was severely damaged and could not be repaired immediately. All passengers on the trains had to get off and walk, changing trains at two civilized spots, and the time required to move luggage and goods was quite long, causing the delay.

### Puppet Commissioner of Minhang Arrested by Guerrillas, Puppet Official Abducted During a Lavish Banquet, Japanese Dare Not Pursue and Unable to Rescue

The "Continental News" reported yesterday (the 26th) that according to people from Minhang, Chen Chaohai (transliteration), the 'Commissioner' of the Minhang Police Bureau, was hosting dozens of guests at a large restaurant in the area on the night of the 18th of this month. Shortly after 7 PM, a group of about 20 armed men arrived at the restaurant and threatened them with guns. Chen and the guests were terrified. These uninvited guests abducted Chen, and his whereabouts are unknown. Until last week, it was not known where Chen was. However, villagers said that Chen had been taken to a guerrilla unit several miles upstream. Minutes after the armed men abducted Chen from the restaurant, a large group of Japanese troops arrived and tracked them to the riverbank, but were unable to continue due to the darkness. It is said that Chen Chaohai once engaged in guerrilla activities under Ding Xishan in Pudong. He was the first to defect and joined the puppet 'Municipal Police Bureau'. He was sent to Minhang at the beginning of this month. It is said that Ding Xishan also defected several months ago.

### Exceptionally Cold Weather, Another Sixteen Beggars Frozen to Death, Sixty-Seven Beggar Corpses Found in Three Days, Yesterday There Was Light Fog, Prevent Seasonal Diseases Due to Prolonged Sunny Weather

The weather in this city has become harsh again recently due to the influence of a high-pressure system. The temperature is hovering around freezing. Many beggars who are exposed on the streets have frozen to death due to the cold wave. On the 24th and 25th, 51 bodies were found. Although the temperature was slightly warmer the day before yesterday (the 26th), the dew was heavy and the frost was severe in the morning and evening. There were still many frozen beggar corpses in the streets. A total of 16 corpses were collected by Pushan Villa. A total of 67 corpses, large and small, were found in the central and western districts in the past three days. There was also light fog last night, and the prolonged sunny weather without rain is especially conducive to seasonal diseases, so prevention is essential.

### Japanese Ship Huazhong Maru Escapes Danger From Reefs, Hull Damaged in Various Parts, Most of the Rice Is Buried in the Bellies of Fish

According to maritime industry news, the Japanese Huazhong Fisheries Association's fishing vessel Huazhong Maru No. 21, which was loaded with rice from Shanghai and sailing to Shenjiamen, suddenly ran aground and sank on the Putuo waters a few days ago, as reported earlier. It is now learned that the ship has been towed off the reef to Shen. However, the hull is severely damaged, and most of the rice has been lost to the fish's bellies. The remaining rice, which has been soaked and rotted, has been transported to Shenjiamen Town by a chartered ship and is being sold at a reduced price.

### Prosperous Shanghai-Ningbo Cargo Transportation, Additional Tax Police Assigned for Inspection

Since the Wenzhou route was obstructed by Japanese warships, passenger and cargo traffic on the Shanghai-Ningbo route has become increasingly crowded. The Reiss & Co.'s Haifu ship, after arriving in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 24th, completed the loading and unloading of passengers and cargo and departed for Zhenhai at 4:30 PM on the afternoon of the 26th with 650 passengers. It is scheduled to pick up passengers in Zhenhai again on the 29th of this month and return to Shanghai. Furthermore, due to the approaching end of the year, the various types of goods being loaded from Shanghai to Ningbo are even more numerous than before. In order to prevent smuggling, the Jianghai Customs has specially assigned additional tax police to board the ships before they set sail to inspect passengers' luggage and goods, which is quite strict. It is also learned that the Moufu is currently docked in Zhenhai, starting to unload cargo from the previous trip to Ningbo. After completing the year-end work this year, it will return to Shanghai. Next is the Hana, which is anchored to unload goods and will take until early next year before it can carry passengers away from Zhenhai. The Feikang is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Ningbo on the 29th.

### Four More High Tides in the Huangpu River Starting Next Month on the Eighth

According to the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau, there will be four more days of high tides in the Huangpu River from the 8th to the 11th of next month, with quantities all above ten feet, making them the highest of the winter low-tide season. At that time, the low-lying roads will be flooded.

### U.S. Consul's Mission in the Philippines Completed, Expected to Return to Shanghai, Will Return to Shanghai From the Philippines Around New Year's Day Next Year, Varying Rumors About the Content of the Philippine Conference

U.S. Consul General to Shanghai Gauss took advantage of his leave and accompanied Admiral Hart to the Philippines on the flagship Augusta on November 21st. He also met his wife and eldest son, Charles, who arrived in Manila from San Francisco on the Pan American Airways' clipper. Gauss has been away from his post for more than a month. According to the U.S. Consulate, Gauss can

Return to Shanghai with His Family Around New Year's Day Next Year, Arriving in Shanghai No Later Than the Second. According to reliable sources obtained by the Xin Sheng News Agency, Gauss may change and take the Augusta flagship to Shanghai. After the New Year's holiday, Gauss will resume his duties. According to reports, Consul General Gauss met with U.S. Ambassador Johnson on November 21st, then suddenly went with

Admiral Hart to the Philippines. He arrived in the Philippines on the 25th. Gauss went to the airport on the afternoon of the 27th of this month to meet his wife and eldest son who had flown to the Philippines from the United States. He then held a special meeting in Baguio on the 2nd of this month with Admiral Hart and U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre to review various issues concerning the United States in the Far East, lasting about three hours. The details

Have Not Been Published. According to an official announcement in Washington, the leader meeting of the three giants is regarded as a routine meeting of U.S. leaders stationed in the Far East every year. They do not underestimate the importance of the situation in Asia. This is the background of the meeting. According to another informal criticism from U.S. officials, the Manila Conference is, at most, advisory in nature or to assist in the implementation of

Established Policies. At the very least, it can show that the United States has broad interests in the Far East, and these broad interests have been directly affected by the war. The three giants will review it. According to another commentary, the nature of the meeting, such as the U.S.'s

U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1911, the U.S.'s relationship with the Dutch East Indies, and the U.S.'s problem with China, are waiting to be reported after the meeting. After Gauss resumes his duties, Counselor Lovett, who is acting as Consul General, will return north in early January. As for Admiral Hart, who went to the Philippines, he is inspecting defenses in the Philippines and will not come north in the short term. He will return to Shanghai after March next spring.

### Jianghai Customs Repeatedly Asks for the Return of Patrol Ships, Still No Results, Although the Number of Japanese Foreign Service Customs Officers Has Increased, Anti-Smuggling Work Is Still Obstructed

All of the Jianghai Customs Maritime Administration's anti-smuggling patrol ships, which were seized by the Japanese side, have been held for two years. Except for the Lianxing, which has been released by the Japanese, the remaining patrol ships have not been returned by the Japanese. Therefore, if the Customs wants to resume maritime anti-smuggling work, it must have enough patrol ships to dispatch. This is difficult to say. As a result, coastal smuggling is rampant, and incidents of drug trafficking in the Huangpu River are also common. It is now learned that Customs Commissioner Luo Fude has repeatedly made representations to the Japanese side, requesting the release of all the seized patrol ships. However, the Japanese side is still insincere and has only agreed to return another patrol ship, Yunxing, first. However, this has not been realized. It has been found that the number of Japanese staff in the Customs' foreign service has increased recently. This staff, including those engaged in anti-smuggling work, is among them. However, the Japanese side does not provide the Customs with various conveniences in the implementation of anti-smuggling work due to the increase in Japanese anti-smuggling officers.

### Employees of Science Company Request Improved Treatment, Submit Two Methods to the Company

Over 100 employees of the Fuzhou Road Science Printing Company have recently felt that the cost of living is rising and that even the minimum living standard is difficult to maintain. Therefore, yesterday, five representatives from the company's mutual aid association met with the company's authorities and submitted two requests: (1) Those with wages of 20 yuan or less should receive a 50% salary increase, those with wages of 30 yuan or less should receive a 40% salary increase, those with wages of 40 yuan or less should receive a 30% salary increase, those with wages of 50 yuan or less should receive a 20% salary increase, and those with wages above 50 yuan should receive a 10% salary increase. (2) All employees of the Science Company should be treated equally in accordance with the regulations.

### The Only Weapon to Control the War, British Coal Exports Rise (Part 2), German Coal Cannot Communicate Transportation Routes, U.S. Coal Is Exported to South America With Export Incentives

— Quan

Polish coal blocks, competing for sales in Switzerland, are almost on par with British coal. In 1938, Polish coal sales to Switzerland totaled 2,383,000 tons, while British coal was 2,698,000 tons. Poland also occupies the coal market in countries such as Finland, Norway, and Denmark. Due to treaty relations, British coal has been rising rapidly in recent years. Wherever Polish coal is sold, there is British coal. Therefore, the British coal export trade index is progressing day by day.

Germany's main transportation problem in the Baltic Sea is that repeated attacks on neutral countries' ships on the south bank have caused transportation trade items such as coal, goods, and timber to be suspended. This is what we have witnessed. Soviet diplomats, in any case, will no longer tolerate this and will try to stop and eliminate dangerous actions. Therefore, on the north bank of the Baltic Sea, neutral countries' cargo will never be in danger and will be protected by the Soviet government. If a neutral country's ship sails from Malmo, Sweden, to British territorial waters, there will be no obstruction.

The political situation along the Baltic Sea, although a small market, is where traders compete for profits. However, the situation is bleak. Neutral countries, Britain is doing its best, and is still trading with them. Neutral Baltic countries could not get credit from Germany before the war, so a large amount of military supplies could not be lent to Germany. The neutral countries of Northern Europe generally believe that trading with Britain is more beneficial to their own interests, so they tend to trade with Britain. Germany recently realized that the situation was unfavorable to it, so it tried to destroy the cargo ships of neutral countries and cut off imports of timber and other goods.

The interests of both Britain and neutral countries are undoubtedly beneficial. Britain itself can profit and obtain great benefits. In the neutral countries, including the countries of Scandinavia and Finland, they also benefit. If the Soviet Union wants to take the opportunity to rise and seize the market, it may not be able to realize its wishes and share the remaining profits.

Markets far from Northern Europe, such as the countries of South America, are also experiencing different planning problems regarding wartime transportation. Since South America is far from Britain, and the nature of coal is heavy and difficult to transport, Britain has joined more British merchant ships for shipping in order to compete for sales, because the coal export trade is of great benefit to Britain. Britain, with its sharp eyes, feels that there is a need to compete for sales. In recent years, it has spared no effort to carry out strong activities to dump goods in South American countries, so progress is particularly rapid.

Before the war, Germany set up a distribution office in Brazil, South America, to manage coal exports, transportation, and competition. In addition, Brazil itself has no foreign exchange relationship, and both sides trade goods for goods. Britain also feels the same difficulties with foreign exchange in trade with Brazil. German coal exports to Argentina are even more effortful to promote. Currently, British coal exports to Argentina are less than German coal exports. Germany is currently maintaining this advantage, so Britain's competition in South America is encountering a strong enemy. Not only that, but recently U.S.-registered merchant ships have joined the competition, trying to curb the sales of British coal. Before the outbreak of the war, Argentina and Brazil were deeply concerned that British coal could not be imported into their countries due to the war, so they turned to U.S. merchants to order U.S. coal, which slightly hit Britain.

The American International Coal Merchants Association and the United Coal Mine Committee decided to reduce freight rates in order to resist European coal in order to export U.S. coal. The development of this situation is even more turbulent for the South American market. The most obvious before the war was timber. The American Coal Mine Committee is preparing to establish a systematic organization in South America to absorb resources. According to the committee, Britain's coal and grain are well known in neutral countries and have historical value. The coal in Wales, Britain, is of excellent quality, and no country dares to compete with it. In addition, British coal exports have low freight rates, which is the main reason for defeating other countries. On the other hand, U.S. coal exports often return with empty ships after loading and exporting, and cannot be reloaded with other goods. This difficulty is a factor of failure. The United States is afraid of Britain in this regard. The American United Coal Mine Committee believes that it is necessary to overcome this difficulty and further try to ship coal for export free of charge to compete with European coal and has approved subsidies. However, the U.S. is still afraid of British coal sales, because Britain will continue to find ways to ship coal for export during the war and promote it to South American countries as much as possible.

What is surprising to all countries is that the U.S. trade in South America (the earliest was the British coal market), its active situation, as of last year, was still far ahead, far surpassing Britain. British coal sales to Argentina received special benefits. In 1938, the export amount was 199 million Argentine pesos, while the U.S. was far behind with only 130 million Argentine pesos.

In addition to using domestic timber for its own use, Britain plans to export about 30 million to 40 million tons to the above-mentioned countries every year. As far as we know, Britain is proceeding smoothly with this plan. Although Britain is at war, it is still making wartime preparations for domestic industries and is working hard not to stop foreign trade. Therefore, the coal export trade is Britain's strongest and only weapon, with which to obtain pig iron and raw materials in return to meet wartime needs. (End)

### Mrs. Mao's Encounter with Air Raid: Conflicting News and Widespread Concern; Investigation Reveals Victim Was Female Accountant at Chiang Residence; Foreign Reports Claimed Injuries Led to Death

Six Japanese planes raided Fenghua Xikou on the twelfth of this month, and because Xikou is the hometown of Chairman Chiang, foreign reports erroneously stated that Chairman Chiang's wife, Mrs. Mao, had died. Reuters in Chongqing has now confirmed that this is incorrect. A Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the true situation of the bombing of Xikou, as follows:

Wenchang Pavilion Completely Destroyed

According to Datong's inquiry with reliable Ningbo groups in Shanghai, who sent personnel to Xikou to inspect the situation, six Japanese planes raided Xikou on the twelfth of this month and dropped a total of nineteen bombs. Four bombs, including two incendiary bombs, hit Wenchang Pavilion, immediately starting a fire. This historic building was completely destroyed by the poisonous flames. Several ancient trees in front of Wenchang Pavilion, some hundreds of years old, were also broken and withered.

Chiang's Residence Shaken

Wuling School, the best-equipped school in Fenghua County, also had one bomb dropped on its playground and two bombs on the mountain behind the school, collapsing several school buildings. The auditorium was undamaged. The remaining bombs fell in the residential area of the town, causing partial damage to Chairman Chiang's residence, known as the "Old and New House" in the town. The female accountant, Dong Zhang, died. This is the origin of the erroneous reports of Mrs. Mao's death.

Another Foreign Report

The English-language "China Press" reported that Mrs. Mao, who is divorced from Chairman Chiang, died during the air raid on Xikou on the twelfth of this month. Relatives of Mrs. Mao in the city who attended the funeral have reported this. The English-language "China Press" obtained confirmation of Mrs. Mao's death on Saturday of last week but did not publish it, fearing that Fenghua would be subjected to further bombing while Mrs. Mao's only son, Chiang Ching-kuo, was rushing home to attend the funeral.

Death After Being Crushed

According to recent news, Mrs. Mao was taking shelter in the old Chiang family residence when the house collapsed due to the tremors, and she was crushed under the rubble. Neighbors rushed to rescue her, but she was barely alive. Despite emergency treatment, she did not regain consciousness and died several hours later. At the same time, six or seven of Mrs. Mao's nephews and grand-nephews also died. Chairman Chiang and Chiang Ching-kuo in Jiangxi immediately received the bad news. Chairman Chiang was unable to leave Chongqing due to official duties and instructed his son to rush to the funeral and make arrangements. Chiang Ching-kuo then flew to Xikou and stayed for several days.

No Confirmation from Chinese Sources

When the news of Mrs. Mao's death was first published, news reporters stationed in Chongqing were unable to obtain confirmation. The Chinese authorities in Chongqing said they were unaware of the matter. However, yesterday (the 26th), Reuters issued a denial, saying that Mrs. Mao had neither died nor been injured.

### Tragic Accident Under Wheels

A truck, F-1940, belonging to Sun Fu Ji Truck Transportation Company, driven by driver Wu Guojun (30 years old) from Nantong, was fully loaded with fuel coal and was traveling along Avenue Henri in the French Concession at 1:50 PM yesterday. As it turned onto Avenue Raoul towards the south, a poor Ningbo woman, Yu Zhu, whose 13-year-old daughter, Yu Yinmei, lived in a bungalow at 556 Route de Zikawei, saw the slow-moving truck and rushed to the left side to try to steal coal from the truck. She was careless and was knocked down by the truck, falling under the wheels. The rear left wheel of the truck crushed her skull, and blood and brains splattered everywhere. She died instantly. Chinese constable Yang Yuqing, number 1244, saw this and signaled Wu to stop the truck. He dragged the body out and reported it to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate. The truck and the driver were taken to the police station for further investigation. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch mortuary for examination, pending a court-ordered autopsy.

### Murder of Night Watchman and Robbery of Handgun: Life Sentence Imposed; Rampant Banditry in Cold Weather; Police Intensify Arrests

Chinese and Western detectives from the Yulin Road police station recently arrested three notorious bandits, Zhang Jinbiao, Shen Mulin, and Cao A'quan. It was discovered that these individuals made a living by armed robbery within the concession. Since February of this year, they had committed more than ten armed robberies of money and property in various locations, including 48, Lane 714, Xiaoshadu Road, and 36, Lane 234, Route Mercier. On February 13th, they attempted to seize the handgun of Chinese night watchman Jiang Youcai, number 1164, at the Zhenglun Factory on Route Gordon near Route Mercier, and killed Jiang with an axe. They were sent to the First Special Court, where they confessed clearly. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin presided over the First Criminal Court and announced the verdict. Zhang Jinbiao, also known as Zhang Yixiaozi, was sentenced to life imprisonment for continuous joint robbery and intentional homicide, with deprivation of public rights for life. Shen Mulin was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for repeatedly joining gangs for nighttime burglary. Cao A'quan was sentenced to five years of imprisonment as a warning.

Selling Antiques Turns Out to Be a Band of Thieves

Yesterday afternoon, three Jiangbei natives, Jiang Caixi, Cai Hongchun, and Jiang Wang, from the Baosheng Antique Shop at 1253 Avenue Edward VII, brought several antiques, intending to sell them. Detectives Che Xueceng and Ni Chuangsheng, and Western Detective Chief Tailai of the Chengdu Road police station saw them and arrested the three Jiangs. They then went to 4 Tongzhou Road and arrested Jiang Caishi, Zhu Xiaosan, You Da, and Chen Guangchun. They also confiscated several antiques. Later, at 7, Lane 121, East Aihun Road, they found a fake handgun and took it to the police station. It was discovered that these individuals were involved in a robbery of a Westerner in Hongkou several days ago, involving 7,000 yuan. They were ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Jiang Baolian presented the case and requested detention, which the court approved.

Holding Rent Receipts: Bandits Covet

Wang Jinwen, a clerk at the Deng Rentai Rice Store at 585 Fujian Road, was in charge of collecting accounts and rent for the owner. At 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, Wang came downstairs from a rice industry tea party at the Qinglian Pavilion, holding a package of rent receipts. While passing the entrance of the Andong Hotel on Hubei Road, two bandits suddenly appeared. One held a handgun and tried to rob Wang of the package. Wang resisted slightly. The bandit with the gun fired a shot at the lower part of Wang's coat, but it did not penetrate the skin. The other bandit took the opportunity to snatch the package and fled along Jiu'an Lane. Wang shouted for robbers, and the bandits fired two more shots at him, both hitting the lower part of Wang's coat without causing any injury. Fortunately, Chinese Detective Guo Ruiquan and Chinese constable number 2149 from the Laozha police station heard the alarm and arrived. They arrested one bandit named Yang Guisheng (from Jiangbei). The bandit threw the package of rent receipts on the ground, which the detectives retrieved. The other bandit with the gun escaped. The arrested bandit was taken back to the police station and was sent to the First Criminal Court yesterday. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the incident, requesting that the hearing be postponed because the accomplices who were still at large needed to be arrested. Judge Feng Shide, after questioning both parties, ordered Yang's detention and adjourned the hearing.

### Fake Officials Conspire to Extort: Attempted Kidnapping of Dancer; Attempt to Extort 20,000 Yuan from Sheng Jinqing; Claim to be Cousin of Dancer Tang Ying; Conflicting Statements During Separate Interrogations

Sheng Jinqing, a 34-year-old Shanghai native and owner of Shengyi Xing Cotton Yarn Company at 465 Beijing Road, frequented theaters and dance halls. Before February, Sheng met Tang Ying (18 years old, from Jiading) at the Paramount Ballroom on YuYuan Road, and they were on good terms. After Sheng and Tang met, the Sheng family received phone calls claiming to be from Tang Ying's family, stating that Sheng had seduced and raped Tang at the Greater Shanghai Hotel. Therefore, if Sheng did not pay a substantial amount of money, the matter could not be resolved. Sheng ignored these calls. On the 10th of this month, a Fujian native, Xu Ming, went to Sheng's house and told Sheng's wife, Ren (22 years old, Shanghai native), that Tang Ying would take illegal measures because Sheng Jinqing had seduced and abandoned her, so it would be better to give a substantial amount of money to resolve the matter. Sheng ignored this as well. On the night of the 20th, at 10:00 PM, Sheng went to the Paramount Ballroom as usual to dance with Tang Ying. At this time, two Ningbo natives, Xin Dingsheng, and Jilin native Zhang Fengyi, approached Sheng's table. Xin introduced Zhang to Sheng, saying that Zhang worked at the Japanese military headquarters and was Tang Ying's cousin. If Sheng would spend 20,000 yuan, the matter could be resolved, otherwise, he would be detained to the Japanese military headquarters, and he would regret it later. But the negotiation did not result in an agreement, and they parted unhappily. On the night of the 23rd, at 12:35 AM, Xin and Zhang, along with three or four others, drove to Sheng's house in a silver car. Xin appeared to be holding a weapon, attempting to take Sheng away. However, Sheng was not at home at the time, and he was spared. On the 24th at noon, Sheng and his wife, Ren, went to the Daxin Restaurant on Yuqiaqing Road for lunch. Xin and Zhang, along with seven or eight others, rushed over and beat Sheng and his wife without asking any questions, causing injuries to Sheng's chest and other parts of his body, and injuries to Ren's face and fingers. Zhang and the others then tried to take Sheng away. Fortunately, Chinese Detective 2066 and Chinese Detective Chief Li Pengfei from the Laozha police station heard the noise and arrived, taking the group into custody. Xu Ming was then arrested. However, after being detained, Zhang only spoke Japanese. After the police called in a Japanese detective to inquire, they learned that Zhang's Japanese was not proficient. After the detectives questioned him sternly, Zhang began to answer in Mandarin, saying that he worked as a clerk in the Fake Municipal Government Land Bureau. Although he had spoken to Sheng about Tang Ying, he had not demanded 20,000 yuan or intended to kidnap him. The captain ordered that Zhang, Xin, and Xu be detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the incident, saying that the three defendants were suspected of kidnapping for ransom and extortion and that the matter had not yet been investigated. He therefore requested detention. He also said that Tang Ying had not been found after the detectives searched for her. Yesterday, she came to the court herself, claiming that she had no illicit relationship with Sheng, and did not know Zhang Fengyi. She requested to be summoned. The court then summoned Tang to the case. Tang suddenly claimed that Sheng had forced her to become a dancer and that Zhang Fengyi was indeed her cousin. Zhang's mother and her mother were sisters. The court then ordered Zhang to leave temporarily and questioned Tang about the whereabouts of her parents. She replied that her father was from Guangdong, and her mother was from Nanxiang, surnamed Gu, and her maternal grandfather was named Gu Shousen, but she did not know anything else. After the court questioned Zhang, he said that his mother was Japanese, named Kimura, and Tang's mother was Kimura's sister, so he and Tang were cousins. The statements were clearly completely inconsistent. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the statements and ordered the three defendants to be detained for further investigation.

### Cotton Boat Near Waibaidu Bridge Catches Fire

### Two Men Kidnapped on Route Ghisi Yesterday Evening: Black-plated Car Blocks the Road; Thugs Forcefully Push Them into Car with Guns; Another Man Escapes

On Route Ghisi in the French Concession at approximately 8:50 PM last evening, a private car with black license plate number 1357 was traveling west to east when three men were also walking on the road. Unexpectedly, the car suddenly stopped as it approached the three men, and armed thugs jumped out of the car, blocking the road and forcibly ordering them to get into the car. Two of the men were pushed and pulled into the car, but the other man managed to escape. He rushed to report to the post constable, who relayed the information to the police station, which sent detectives to the scene. The car had already sped away. They immediately reported the incident and ordered all detectives to investigate. It is generally believed that this case involves political motives. The surnames of the two kidnapped men are still under investigation.

### Extortion by Impersonating Police Officers

A Chongming native, Du, who lived at 408 Rue Massenet, was addicted to smoking opium. Recently, Qian Yongchang (40 years old) from Haimen reported to the "Five Continents Detective Agency" at 367 Jiangxi Road that Du was a commander of the Chongming guerrillas but had defected and obtained a large amount of military pay from the Japanese, then fled to Shanghai and set up a drug trafficking organization in the French Concession. After receiving the report, the so-called Western Detective Chief Ma Ying (transliteration), a Ceylonese national under French protection, Chinese Detective Chief Qiu Haitao (35 years old, Nantong native), detectives Wang Qiying (23 years old, Yancheng native), and Gao Wenbin (22 years old, Yancheng native) saw an opportunity to exploit. On the morning of the 23rd of this month, at approximately 9:00 AM, they took a short man, Ling Zhenzhang (35 years old, Taizhou native), along with Qian Yongchang, and rushed to Du's residence. They loudly claimed to Du that someone had reported him and that today the Japanese (referring to Ling Zhenzhang) had come with the French police to arrest him. Du was willing to pay for a private settlement. After bargaining from 8,000 yuan to 600 yuan, they agreed to the payment. Unexpectedly, his family had already reported the extortion to the French police by phone, and detectives Shen Jinshu, Zhong Benchang, and Xu Fuming rushed to the scene, capturing the criminals and confiscating three pairs of handcuffs, three flashlights, and 600 yuan in stolen money. Except for Ma Ying, who was transferred to the French Consulate, Qiu and the other four were sent to the Second Special Court yesterday and requested to be detained for interrogation. Judge Sun Pengham interrogated the defendants separately, then ordered them to be detained for further hearing.

### Robberies and Notes: Five Incidents in One Day Yesterday; All Victims Suffered Losses

East Youheng Road: At approximately 3:00 AM yesterday morning, bandits forced open the main door and entered 25, Lane 595, East Youheng Road, Hongkou. Two of the bandits were armed with handguns. They woke up the people in the house, drove them into a corner, and guarded them while they searched the house. As a result, they stole valuables worth a total of 1,157 yuan and fled. When the victims saw the bandits leave the house, they shouted for help. The bandits panicked and fired two shots into the air as a warning, then left calmly. The victims were helpless and reported the incident to the police after dawn.

Xiaoshadu Road: At approximately 11:20 AM yesterday morning, four bandits rushed into a residence at 1107 Xiaoshadu Road. Two of them were armed with handguns. Taking advantage of the open back door of the house, they rushed in and first guarded the men and women, then extorted valuables. As a result, they stole 800 yuan in cash and fled. The victims have reported the incident to the police and requested an investigation.

Haifang Road: At approximately 3:15 PM yesterday afternoon, six bandits broke into 527 Haifang Road. All the people in the house were guarded by two armed bandits. As a result, valuables worth more than 1,300 yuan were stolen and they fled. Afterwards, the victims reported the incident to the police and requested an investigation. After detectives investigated the case, they apprehended a suspect and have taken him to the police station for interrogation.

Rosen Road: At approximately 3:20 PM yesterday afternoon, a fashionably dressed and wealthy young woman was passing by Rosen Road in Puxi in her private car when two armed bandits suddenly jumped out of hiding, blocked the car, opened the door, and threatened the woman, demanding that she hand over her valuables. The woman was unable to escape, and all her jewelry and cash, worth more than 2,000 yuan, were taken. Afterwards, the woman immediately reported the incident to the police and requested an investigation.

Education News

### Ministry of Education Improves Military Training and Military Management in Schools: Concentrated Military Training, Attention to Student Health, Careful Selection of Military Instructors and Teacher Training

(Chongqing Hangxun) During this year's Third National Education Conference, regarding the military training scout proposal, in addition to the resolution that "Scout training should be strengthened in guerrilla zones, war zones, or areas close to war zones" (the Ministry of Education is recommended to jointly host a Chinese Scout Training Class with the China Scout Headquarters and the Political Department to train wartime service cadres in guerrilla zones, war zones, and areas close to war zones). Regarding the "Improvement Plan for School Military Training and Military Management" jointly proposed by many members and the Sichuan Education Department, which was passed by the general assembly, the Ministry of Education has now publicly released it. The original text of this plan is recorded below:

Matters for Concentrated Military Training: (1) After completing three years of high school, students should receive three months of concentrated training. The training curriculum will be detailed by the Ministry of Education. (2) During concentrated military training, attention should be paid to students' health. (a) Conduct detailed health examinations before and after joining the team, pay attention to students with physical and mental deficiencies, and prevent the bad habit of escaping training under false pretenses. (b) Students must sleep at least eight and a half hours a day and pay attention to daytime rest. (c) Pay attention to the nutritional value of students' food, and the mealtime should be at least 15 minutes. (d) Prevent the occurrence of student diseases and pay attention to treatment.

Matters for Regular Training: (1) Regular military training should continue to be implemented in high schools and above. (2) The Ministry of Education should jointly recompile military teaching materials suitable for schools with the Political Department. (3) The Educational administrative organs in charge should coordinate the financial allocation methods for the enrichment of military education equipment.

Military Instructor Personnel Matters: (1) Schools should establish school instructor training agencies, recruit university graduates and graduates of formal military schools, and provide them with one year of training. For the former, focus on military academic subjects, and for the latter, focus on educational principles, methods, and general knowledge of various subjects. (2) The list of qualified instructors should be announced by the Political Department, and the educational administrative organs should appoint them from the list of qualified candidates. (3) The number of instructors in each school should be properly allocated in proportion to the number of students.

School Military Management Matters: (1) The position of military management in school education should be determined, and the responsibilities of military instructors and other school education personnel should be separated. (2) School military management should be based on the principle of adapting to school life and should strive for rationalization. (3) Important school staff must participate in school military management.

### Overview of This Year's University Unified Entrance Examination (60)

If a student lists the Civil Engineering Department as their first choice, the Medical School as their second choice, and the Geography Department as their third choice, then they will have to take additional biology and foreign history and geography exams. Since the choices are mixed, if a grouping admission standard is adopted, such candidates will inevitably have two opportunities to be admitted. It would be better to cancel this method of taking exams for two groups; otherwise, the mathematics level of the third group is higher than that of the first group, and foreign history and geography are also listed as required subjects. Then they can also take the first group exam. Judging from the nature of each group, it is too unreasonable. As for promoting science, it is reasonable to combine the various departments of the engineering college, which can also reduce the difficulty of distribution and the disparity in the number of students in each department. Third, the issue of equivalent academic ability: Allowing students with equivalent academic ability to apply for the exam is aimed at breaking the restrictions on qualifications and selecting talented or outstanding students. The intention is originally good, but how academic ability is equivalent becomes a problem. Since there is equivalent academic ability, it does not seem appropriate to have restrictions on qualifications. However, learning is improved step by step. No matter what, the subjects learned in the third year of high school have not been learned by students in the second year of high school unless they are geniuses. Their academic ability will not be equivalent. Moreover, those who claim equivalent academic ability to apply for the exam, most students in the second year of high school and above want to try. This year, there were 5,000 applicants with equivalent academic ability, accounting for a quarter of all applicants. As long as these students pass the university exam, they can escape the difficult hurdle of the high school entrance examination. Those who fail one or two subjects in the high school entrance examination can only be probationary students after entering university according to the law, while those who pass the exam with equivalent academic ability can be formal students, which is somewhat unfair. However, it is not unreasonable to select geniuses with equivalent academic ability. Since it is to select geniuses, the proportion of admission should be further restricted, and the maximum should not exceed 5% of the total number of admissions, and must be limited to those who are ranked in the first half. Fourth, the issue of quick handling of examination affairs: The unified examination is a national examination, which is related to the further education of high school graduates across the country. Delaying the announcement by one day means that students waste one day. However, in fact, there are too many divisions and traffic is difficult. The mailing of grade reports and booklets will inevitably be delayed. In the future, in addition to unavoidable factual difficulties, the grading, compiling, calculating, admission, and distribution should be carried out as quickly as possible with the greatest effort. All the Ministry-approved methods and forms must be completely followed to avoid difficulties in handling affairs.

The above is only a discussion of the major points. There are many other minor areas that need to be improved, which will not be repeated here. This article will also come to an end here. I hope readers will discuss and guide this issue more. (End)

### Enthusiastic Response to Assisting Scientific Personnel in Applying: More Than 600 People in Two Weeks

### Fuya School Raises Funds to Build School Buildings

Shanghai Fuya School was founded in 1926, originally located in the Hongqiao Road School for the Blind, covering more than 30 acres, with complete equipment, and known as the Deaf-Mute Paradise. President Dr. Fu Bulan is rich in special teaching experience and has achieved outstanding results. Over the past ten years, more than 200 graduates have served the community and pursued further studies in art, and have achieved success. After the August 13th Incident, the school site happened to be in the war zone, and suffered heavy losses. President Fu returned to the United States due to business, and Vice President Wang resumed classes in the concession. Now, because the hospital will soon take back the part of the building borrowed from Tongren Hospital for its own use, it is necessary to find a new site. When President Fu returned to Shanghai from the United States, he was saddened by the helpless deaf and mute and generously donated 20,000 yuan, hoping to purchase a school building in the two special zones to establish a permanent foundation and benefit deaf and mute children. However, the prices of houses and land in Shanghai are too high. After searching for a long time, he has not been able to make a deal due to the limited amount. The school is urgently requesting assistance from all walks of life to jointly contribute to this good cause, or donate vacant land and houses, half donated and half sold, to make this good deed a success and benefit the poor and helpless deaf and mute. If you have any contacts, please send a letter to Fuya School in Tongren Hospital, opposite Zhaofeng Garden.

### Finance: Rumors of Hong Kong Dollar Devaluation; Hong Kong Banks Telegraph to Sell British Exchange; Transfer to Shanghai to Profit from Local Currency

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation showed that HSBC's listed prices remained stable. The black market for British and American exchange rates initially trended firm but then retreated, ultimately ending slightly weaker. It is widely rumored that there will be major changes in Hong Kong's foreign exchange rates, with rumors circulating in Shanghai over the weekend that the Hong Kong dollar would depreciate to around 8 cents. Therefore, speculators in Hong Kong are selling Hong Kong dollars, absorbing British exchange, telegraphing to Shanghai to profit, and converting into Chinese legal tender. However, HSBC and other British banks have a strong appetite, and importers are constantly settling their accounts, so prices remain relatively stable, with only limited fluctuations. Inquiries regarding the above news could not be confirmed immediately. If it is just an empty rumor, funds from Hong Kong could continue to flow into Shanghai indefinitely. However, if it is realized, the Hong Kong authorities will definitely impose strict controls, the flow of funds to Shanghai will inevitably decrease sharply, and the weakening trend may not last long. Therefore, Chinese merchants and speculators are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude and are hesitant to make any moves, whether long or short. As for the half-day process, the market opened slightly tighter and weaker, but there was trading but no market. Later, Huashang Bank took the lead in selling, followed by a surge of selling from Hong Kong. Furthermore, American banks, such as Chase Bank, also showed a strong desire to supply, and the price quickly rose to 4 cents 78125 and 7 yuan 84375. However, HSBC was happy to absorb at a lower price, and a certain American bank also switched to buying to cover their short positions, stabilizing the market. Later, foreign firms eagerly purchased to settle their accounts, and Japanese banks also strongly bought, so the situation tightened, and the price retreated to 4 cents 71875 and 7 yuan 75. However, the afternoon saw a gradual lack of buyers, and the market became weak again. By the close of the morning session, British gold was at 4 cents 75 and American exchange was at 7 yuan 78125, compared to the previous holiday (i.e., last weekend), British was weaker by 0.046875 and American was cheaper by 0.0625. As for the futures trend, it mirrored the spot market.

Speculative Wait-and-See Attitude Leads to Small Fluctuations

At the beginning of the morning session, London's large gold bars, raw gold, and various British foreign exchange rates were closed for the holiday, with no trading. The American bank's price was slightly lower by 1/375. The exchange rates between the US and the UK, Shanghai, and France were all flat. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the opening of the morning session, the bank's spot selling price was 4 cents 6875 for British gold and 7 yuan 6875 for American exchange, compared to the previous holiday, British was tighter by 0.015625 and American was weaker by 0.03125. After the opening, Huashang Bank took the lead in selling, and the market immediately turned firmer. The bank sold spot British gold to foreign banks at 4 cents 703125. When HSBC's listed prices were revealed and remained unchanged, and the silver balance tax was also revealed and remained unchanged, a sudden surge of selling came from Hong Kong, coupled with continued selling from Huashang Bank, and more selling than buying from Chinese merchants, the market continued to tighten. By 10:15 AM, British gold had tightened to 4 cents 78125, and American exchange had weakened to 7 yuan 84375. However, HSBC suddenly took advantage of the lower price to absorb spot British gold at 4 cents 75. At the same time, a certain bank also bought this month's American exchange at 7 yuan 8125. Later, Japanese banks and foreign firms successively settled their accounts, and there were fewer sellers, so the situation suddenly turned weaker. By 11:30 AM, British gold had returned to 4 cents 71875, and American exchange had returned to 7 yuan 75. There were fewer buyers at noon, and the market became firmer again. By the afternoon, the bank's spot selling price was 4 cents 75 for British gold and 7 yuan 78125 for American exchange. Next month's British gold futures were at 4 cents 71875 and American exchange was at 7 yuan 65625. As a result, compared to last weekend, both spot and futures British were weaker by 0.046875, and American was firmer by 0.0625. There was no trading on Wednesday afternoon.

Hong Kong, 27th: The exchange market opened this morning with an unstable market. British, American, and Japanese exchange rates remained stable.

Shanghai exchange fell by one and a half yuan to 103 yuan. "Lianchao" black market rates rose slightly by 2.5 cents to 94 yuan and 2.5 cents.

### Gold Market Falls

Yesterday's spot gold market was sluggish, and the trend was downward, influenced by the weakening exchange market. Fortunately, the foreign exchange market stabilized slightly, and Hong Kong banks bought at a lower price, so the 4,100 yuan mark, after being broken, was recovered. However, the result was still a loss of 27 yuan. The market opened down 16 yuan at 4,120 yuan. Subsequently, due to the gradual weakening of the exchange market and the fatigue of the market participants, securities firms took the lead in selling and shorting, and gold shops and retail investors also competed to sell, and the market became unsustainable, falling to 4,018 yuan. However, by noon, the foreign exchange market became firmer again, so the morning closed only at 4,112 yuan. The afternoon session was flat, with only 4 yuan of fluctuation, and the market closed at 4,109 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was about 1,500-1,600 taels. Gold shops' jewelry quotations were down 5 yuan, and customs gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Fell 27 Yuan

From the opening of each bar (10 taels) in the morning, the situation remained scattered and weak. The market opened down 16 yuan, with gold shops selling 10 taels to money changers at 4,120 yuan. Shortly after, the market recovered by 3 yuan, with money changers buying 20 taels from securities firms at 4,123 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market continued to weaken, the situation became more uncertain, and securities firms and gold shops rushed to sell, and retail investors also sold off, and the price fell below the 4,100 yuan mark, with securities firms selling 20 taels to money changers at 4,086 yuan. After that, there was a sudden rebound and the market became firm, as the foreign exchange market stopped weakening and began to tighten, and buyers became active. Securities firms first covered their short positions for profit, and then certain money changers suddenly acted on behalf of Hong Kong banks to buy at a lower price, and gold shops also bought in constantly. Although a certain gold shop closed out a small amount of long positions in the meantime, the position still felt that demand was exceeding supply, and the price soon recovered above the 4,100 yuan mark, with gold shops trading 10 taels at 4,130 yuan. At noon, the foreign exchange market became firmer again, so the market saw a further decline, with gold shops selling 20 taels to securities firms at 4,110 yuan, followed by money changers buying 10 taels from gold shops at 4,112 yuan at the closing price of the morning session. The market was calm in the afternoon. The market opened down 5 yuan, with gold shops selling 10 taels to securities firms at 4,107 yuan, followed by gold shops selling 10 taels to gold shops at 4,106 yuan. Later, securities firms bought in slightly, and the market recovered by 4 yuan, with money changers buying 20 taels at 4,100 yuan. Later, gold shops sold 10 taels to money changers at 4,109 yuan at the closing price of the evening session. As a result, compared to the previous holiday (i.e., last Saturday), the price fell by 27 yuan, with a difference of 44 yuan for the whole day. The selling price of cash gold shops was several yuan higher than the spot gold, and the buying price was lowered by 20 yuan. The current spot gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Quotations Down 5 Yuan

The initial selling price of jewelry from gold shops remained at 420 yuan per tael, but the quotation was lowered by 5 yuan at 9:45 AM. After that, there were no changes. As a result, the quotation from Datong Hang was changed to 415 yuan, the same as the Shangjia Hang, with the buying price lowered by about 15 yuan.

### Hong Kong Currency Market Very Weak

Yesterday, the supply of British and American gold pounds was smooth, and the market was weak. British and American gold currency were firm at first and then tired. American gold currency initially rose to about 13 yuan in the morning, but then there was heavy selling and a rapid decline, ending at 12 yuan 86 cents. Hong Kong currency was very weak due to rumors of devaluation, and Hong Kong banks frequently supplied currency. Canadian currency followed the decline due to the weakness of American gold currency. Japanese gold currency was in high demand and the market price rose firmly, ending at 1 yuan 27 cents 5 mills. Korean currency was also firm, ending at 1 yuan 12 cents 5 mills. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds both fell by 1 yuan, British gold currency fell by 5 cents, American gold currency fell by 8 cents, Hong Kong currency fell by 6 cents, Canadian currency fell by 30 cents, and other currencies did not change.

### Discount Rate Decreases

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills and drafts suddenly decreased again, to around 38 yuan per thousand in the morning, and even weaker in the afternoon, ending at 37 yuan and 5 cents, a decrease of one yuan compared to the previous day. The money industry association's interbank lending rate remained at the original rate of 15 cents for both morning and afternoon sessions, it is said.

### Grains: Domestic and Foreign Rice Arriving in Succession; Foreign Rice Totaling Over 70,000 Bags Arrived; Domestic Rice Also Arrived Yesterday, Over 1,000 Bags

The rice market continued to rise in the morning, mainly due to the aftereffects of the previous day. As a result, there were many inquiries at the opening, and the main demand was for foreign rice. The situation for japonica and domestic rice was good. At that time, Saigon rice reached 38.5 yuan, and Siam pointed rice reached about 39 yuan. The prices of japonica and domestic rice varied depending on the quality of the goods. The prices rose all the way up without any setbacks. Unexpectedly, the domestic sources, which had been cut off for a long time, suddenly arrived at the port near noon after being intercepted by a certain party in the name of military rice. About 1,100 bags of Fengjia and other goods were transported by trucks to the Nan Gang. Furthermore, a large amount of foreign rice also arrived, and the market sentiment suddenly weakened. Merchants rushed to sell off their inventories, and local shops immediately faced difficulties. The sales market turned dull, and there was an abundance of goods. As a result, the prices of all goods remained stagnant and unable to be sold. The total trading volume for the market was no more than 5,000 bags, and the prices only increased slightly by one or two cents for foreign rice compared to the previous day. The remaining domestic rice prices remained flat. The closing prices were: Saigon round grain at 38 yuan and 2 cents, long grain at 38 yuan and 5 cents, broken rice at 33 yuan and 67 cents, Siam pointed rice at 38 yuan and 5 cents, Tokyo pointed rice at 35 yuan and 23 cents to 35 yuan, thick japonica Lishun japonica opened at 40 yuan, Qing Si thin rice at 40 yuan, Nan Gang early and late rice at 39 yuan and 78 cents to 39 yuan and 5 cents, Luyang pointed rice at 39 yuan and 5 cents, white yuan at 43 yuan, and secondly at 40 yuan, it is said.

The arrival of guest rice is decreasing, and since the arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai, local merchants have been focusing on Saigon and other rice, and the market is gradually becoming dull. Although the price of 33 yuan can be quoted for the near center, the cost of high-quality goods must be above 35 yuan, and the difference of two or three yuan with the market price is difficult to approach. Therefore, the market is becoming increasingly sluggish, and it is difficult to see a surge in future sources, it is said.

Regarding the large amount of Saigon rice arriving in Shanghai, as reported in this newspaper the day before, it was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day before (26th). It is now known that the rice-carrying ship, the Italian ship Kang Di La Chai (phonetic translation), carrying 40,382 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, arrived at the port yesterday morning and docked at the Gonghexian Wharf in Hongkou to unload at 6:30 AM. Furthermore, the Taikoo Company's Chongqing ship, carrying 21,305 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, and the Jardine Matheson Company's Chunsheng ship, carrying 8,937 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, were both docked at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload.

The first shipment of foreign rice is priced at around 48 yuan, and it is currently difficult to clear. However, yesterday there was a batch of fire-killed rice shipped from Haiphong at a price of 36 yuan, and 500 tons of broken Saigon rice at 35.5 yuan, which are currently being ordered by telegram. The Saigon morning market is currently very active, with prices ranging from 38.5 yuan to 38.8 yuan. After the arrival of the source was announced, orders continued to be negotiated, and the market then returned to a flat 3 cents. Trading was quite good throughout the day, with a total of four to five thousand bags in whole and small quantities.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Northern Merchants Handle By-Product Flour

The flour market did not see any special progress yesterday. Trading on the street was about 10,000 bags or more, still at the original price of 8 yuan and 7 cents. Large merchants were still unwilling to sell more, because the price of wheat raw materials is currently high, and the price of rice in the rice market is also high, so it is difficult to see a decrease in the price of grain for a while, so the foundation is inevitably solid. Yesterday, the northern merchants moved slightly, in addition to sporadically taking 2nd-grade flour, they also opened 5,000 bags of 4th-grade Red Fortune God flour, at a price of 8 yuan and 2 cents. Recycled flour moved slightly due to a shortage of goods and was seen selling briskly, increasing by about 2 cents compared to the factory price. The price of Japanese factory flour fluctuated suddenly. This month, the Phoenix brand factory had a recovery, with the price rising from 8 yuan 22 cents to 25 cents. January also rose from 8 yuan 42 cents to 45 cents. However, the market weakened by a few cents later, and the market presented a situation of firm at first and then flat.

Wheat was in the process of oscillating yesterday, and the market traded sparingly, with only three or four thousand bags sold. The highest price was still 15 yuan, decided to 14 yuan and 5 cents, and the medium-quality goods were invisibly softer by a few cents. Because the sources are currently all small and sporadic, with no whole amount arriving at the port, it is difficult to suppress the market for a while.

Yesterday, 5,000 bags of flour, 2,547 bags of beans, 445 bags of raw kernels, and 16,545 tins of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong. Today, 264 bags of beans and 100 bags of sesame seeds were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Yarn and Cotton: Spot Sales Ultimately Stagnant; Cotton Price Staircases Down

The yarn market, which had rebounded the day before, took on a tiring weak path today, with a trend from opening high and closing low. Actually, although popular sentiment was unanimously bullish, there was no way to overcome the stagnant spot sales, so general speculators suddenly entered and exited, and when the situation stabilized, the table top softened slightly, and then turned downwards. On this basis, the overall market situation is still in a state of hovering. However, raw cotton cannot greatly soften, and the factory cost is increasing daily, so the foundation of the yarn market can be consolidated, and the future depends on the actual sales to shift.

The morning opening of spot yarn continued the firm air of the previous day and continued to advance, while at the same time American cotton also rose, popular sentiment was still good, and many people called for buying in the market. 20-count Changed Horse opened at a price of 741 yuan, up 4 yuan from the previous day. However, as soon as this price opened, a general rush of speculators took advantage of the situation to make a profit, and at the same time, a certain shop sold off the files, so the market shifted from strong to weak. By the time of several transactions, the price of 20-count Double Horse was 736 yuan. According to half-day trading statistics, 1,410 bales were sold. Market conditions: 20-count Double Horse fell by 5 yuan, Heavenly Girl fell by 1 yuan, and Double Earth fell by 3 yuan. 16 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday, and 20 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount of yarn purchased by each shop is listed as follows:

### Cotton Sales Weak: Only Fellow Merchants Enter and Exit Slightly

Trading in this cotton has improved slightly, but it is all mutual forward buying and selling between fellow merchants, and the factory remains as dull as ever. However, popular sentiment is still bullish, because American cotton is still firm, and Indian cotton is already showing signs of calmness. The source from Northern Jiangsu: 2,452 bales of general cotton have arrived, 992 bales of Changyinsha have arrived, and 300 bales of Northsha have arrived. The current cotton transaction situation is recorded on the left.

Another news item on the foreign cotton market: The New York cotton market opened yesterday, and the opening was particularly firm, because buyers were enthusiastic, so the cotton price continued to rise. Later, due to traders buying and shorts covering, the closing price rose by more than 10 pounds compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose by more than two rupees. Egypt and Liverpool were closed.

Trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai has not seen any improvement in recent days, and all parties are quite lonely. Yesterday, the exchange rate trended weaker, and all parties intended to temporarily wait and see. The factory is still not interested in importing raw cotton because the actual sales of cotton yarn have not improved. However, it is predicted that foreign cotton trading will become active after New Year's Day. The price of cotton yesterday, converted at an exchange rate of 7 yuan 8125 for American exchange, is as follows:

20-count American Midland: 240.90

Also lower grade: 233.05

32-count again: 244.35

Also lower grade: 238.25

42-count again: 247.80

Also lower grade: 240.00

Egyptian cotton is the most excellent cotton product in the world, and it is rarely seen in Taiwan. 600 pieces were shipped by Italian ship earlier this month, and 300 pieces arrived in Shanghai yesterday, also shipped by Italian ship.

### Securities: Cautious Bond Market, Rising Foreign Stocks

The securities market was somewhat soft yesterday. The war situation seemed to improve gradually, which slightly boosted confidence. However, there was still no news regarding the eighth redemption of principal and interest for government bonds that are due soon. People are unsure whether it will follow the precedent of the seventh redemption, where the financial community made advance payments, or if bondholders will need to collect payments from Chongqing. The lack of concrete plans has made the market uneasy. We previously predicted that Type A bonds would break through the 60-yuan mark. Noteworthy activities yesterday included continued selling of Da Kang Cheng, a slight rebound in San Shiba Heng Kang, some interest in Lian Yi and Xie Da, and continued selling in Xinfu and Mao Tai. Prices were weaker in the morning but slightly firmer in the afternoon, with changes happening later in the day. The results showed mixed gains and losses. No trading occurred in Type D bonds, while Types A and B were slightly firm, and Types C and E were weak. Total turnover was approximately 400,000 yuan. A concise summary is provided below.

In stock trading, 100 shares of Shanghai Electric and Water Company were traded at a price of 1.16 yuan, slightly weaker than the previous price.

The active potential observed at the close of the stock exchange before the holiday was fully demonstrated yesterday morning. Various industrial stocks were very robust. International Bank, Shanghai Bank, and Ye Guang Real Estate, among others, successively hit new highs. Rubber stocks were generally active, and low-priced stocks accounted for the majority of trading volume. Chen’s, Calender’s, Xue Na Wang’s, and Bo Tu An Nan’s stocks received significant public support. Some high-priced stocks, such as Lang Ge Zhi, Ying Zha Hua, and rubber stocks, also attracted substantial buying. The Central Government 8% bonds rose from 87 to 90 taels, with a turnover of over 100,000 taels, marking a unique feature in yesterday’s bond market.

### 1935 Sichuan Rehabilitation Lottery

(Chongqing Air Express) The eighth lottery for the Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds of 1935 was held in Chongqing on the 15th of this month. The winning numbers drawn were 14, 48, 53, 69, 72, and 94, totaling 4.2 million yuan in principal to be redeemed. Principal and coupons will be paid by the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications in Chongqing on the 31st of this month.

### Silk, Tea, and White Filature Prices at 6,500 Yuan

Since the holiday, overseas silk markets have continued their strong upward trend. New York silk prices rose by 2.2 to 2.3 cents, and Shanghai silk prices rose by 2.5 cents. Trading for the near-term December contracts has stopped, while March and May contracts rose by 1.5 cents each compared to pre-holiday prices. Yokohama was closed yesterday. Local silk prices have risen sharply. Grade 7/8 white filature is priced at 6,500 yuan. Manufacturers are reluctant to sell easily. Transactions at the Jardine Matheson silk exchange have quieted down, showing signs of a year-end trend. In the days leading up to the New Year, the silk market is expected to remain firm and strong without significant changes.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Sugar Rises by Half a Yuan

Yesterday, foreign sugar prices turned firmer due to limited supply. The association's quotation showed a rise of half a yuan for spot 24 coarse white sugar, with local warehouses quoting 58.5 yuan, newly arrived foreign sugar at 59 yuan, old stock at 58.45 yuan, and re-export goods remaining at 48 yuan. Taikoo crystal white sugar also rose by 0.5 yuan, with B-marked sugar quoted at 58.5 yuan at Eastern warehouses and 59 to 58.8 yuan at Western warehouses. CW-marked sugar was at 58.5 yuan, CX-marked at 58 yuan, DY-marked at 57 yuan, and HX-marked at 56.5 yuan. Prices for crystal red and Dutch red sugar remained unchanged. Local refined white sugar was quoted at 58 yuan for Grade 1, 57.5 yuan for Grade 2, 54 yuan for Grade 3, and 52 yuan for Grade 4. Lower grades saw larger price declines. Local Grade 1 crystal sugar was at 68.5 yuan, and Jing Ming crystal sugar at 70 yuan. The prices quoted by domestic sugar firms increased, but trading was cautious, with no transactions. Arrivals included 817 bags of Hong Kong raw sugar, 90 bags of white sugar, and 27 cases of boxed sugar, as well as 996 bags of Amoy brown sugar.

### Textiles: Cloth Prices Rise; Domestic and Export Sales are Active

The cloth market trend is particularly firm. There is strong buying from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tianjin. Continuing bulk transactions for export to Siam and other regions are happening. Factory prices are higher than market prices, and hand-delivered goods are also gradually increasing in price. Bleached cloth, printed cloth, and colored cloth, as well as poplin, continued to rise by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per bolt. Fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth rose by 0.1 to 0.25 yuan per bolt. Orders for about 10,000 bolts of bleached cloth, colored cloth, printed cloth, and linen yarn came from Siam, India, Australia, and other foreign countries. Sichuan and Yunnan buyers ordered over 8,000 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, and wool flannel. Zhejiang and Jiangxi buyers ordered over 130 pieces of striped bleached cloth, bleached cloth, fine cloth, and coarse cloth. Tianjin buyers ordered 70 to 80 pieces of coarse cloth, coarse twill, and poplin. Approximately 500 pieces were traded on the local street.

### Dried Goods: Shortage of Black Melon Seeds

Due to limited arrivals of black melon seeds, market inventories are dwindling, causing prices to rise again. The increase is more significant for smaller and medium-sized varieties. Yesterday, Ji Kui seeds were 71-72 yuan, Ji Zhong seeds were 70 yuan, Xu Kui seeds were 67-68 yuan, Peng Guang and Lin Huai seeds were 61-62 yuan, Dalian Kui seeds were 53-50 yuan, and Jiao seeds were 130-135 yuan.

### Random Notes from the Coast

— Border Salt

Sandy Island.

Red soil, etched with the chaotic footprints of the receding tide. Flowing water, hazy like smoke, reflects the light blue of the sky, slowly flowing.

With the mindset of a drifter, I looked at the flowing water, the solemn seagoing vessel (it brought me here!), and the distant sky. I couldn't help but feel a sense of quiet loneliness. However, I suppressed it with a man's pride. I lightly jumped onto the strange vehicle, a clumsy ox wasting human labor. However, sitting on this "half" here, it was a different experience. The wheels churned the yellow earth underfoot, and the axle emitted strange noises. The small path meandered through the flower fields (cotton fields), with buckwheat's white flowers blooming along the roadside.

The sea breeze carried the scent of mint everywhere.

Dark-skinned peasant women, wearing long skirts, picked flowers, while old men stayed in small roadside huts doing small business. These huts had habitually become waystations for travelers. Here, the cart driver could get water and cake, and the traveler could find shade under a piece of reed door.

Arriving at Songcang, the sun was about to set. This was not a town in Jiangnan. Far away, one could hear the market sounds and a warm atmosphere. Here, there was only lonely desolation, and the eyes of the residents were so gloomy.

Dragging my legs, which were numb from the cart ride, I lodged at a place by a dark river, within a bamboo fence, and found warm hospitality. A middle-aged man was under the eaves, reading a letter in the dim light. Then, he tore the letter paper bit by bit, put it in his mouth, and chewed it. He invited me into his small house. Under the lamp, I ate wheat rice and vegetables freshly dug from the garden. We quickly became familiar. Contrary to his outward appearance, he was a passionate man. If there was a hidden passion in the dim expressions of the residents here, then this middle-aged man was a good example.

At dusk, the middle-aged man led me to an old house by the sea, a dilapidated thatched cottage, which was the location of "An Ning." Outside the house was a fence covered with vines, with dried gourds hanging on the fence. This fence obscured the quiet but lonely air in the small courtyard. Outside was an autumn night fog, a symphony of insect sounds and the howling of the sea.

Under the lamp, the desolation around me was a little scary, but I was very tired, and I drifted into many chaotic dreams.

Good sun. Here, this will be my home. The monotony here, the desolation, the streets filled with the scent of wild grass - a deserted market.

The middle-aged man told me about yesterday's situation. He described their misfortune to me, and I understood their bad luck, a group of people abused by "searches."

Three miles away, there was a bright and clean house. The middle-aged man led me there for the first morning. I saw a seriously injured young man. They introduced me to him, saying that I was also from where they were. His weak eyes lit up with joy, like receiving "news from home," but immediately calmed down again, pretending not to care about those things.

Two young women, one a nurse, the other a literature student from the passionate South, were jumping and busy!

The middle-aged man did not introduce us, but we quickly became familiar. A warm feeling passed through the lonely hearts, unspoken -

And with the slender, gentle, and firm Zang (the literature student), we had many things in common. We got closer. We felt that living here in the future, "working the land" together, even suffering persecution together, would be a delightful arrangement:

"Coming to the desolate sandy island, looking for light, looking for flowers? You will be disappointed!"

"We came to cultivate!" We laughed in agreement! "There is good land here!"

"Don't miss home. Leaving home is no problem?" She smiled, perhaps thinking I saw her as a child, but she seemed even happier.

"Skillfully 'walked' away!..."

But on the somber next day, an old sand boat carried me away from this bay, before I even had time to think. Now, this bay, this space, I am gazing at it

### Eternal Persistence

— Moss Gatherer

Without starlight or moonlight to light the way,
The universe is seized by darkness;
The wind blows frantically,
And I walk in haste.

Rushing down and climbing up the mountain again,
Thorns tear at my clothes.
The East is still so dark,
Sweat bathes me, and fatigue torments me.

My legs move more and more numbly,
I feel like I'm floating in mid-air,
Suddenly I trip and fall, only to see around me
Corpses lying in disorder like the Eight Trigrams.

A wisp of sound floats in the air,
Its sinister voice burying me in an icy cave;
It comes from a corpse nearby:
"Come, my beloved friend."

On that corpse, a cluster of will-o'-the-wisps rises,
Walking towards it, I shiver like a captive;
I see it's a soldier who died in battle,
Blood dripping onto the broken bedding.

"The body dies, but not the love,
I still love you, as I love the future;
Use this will-o'-the-wisp to examine me,
Kiss my stiff lips, don't be sad.

"Shedding blood is not to be feared, I laugh at shedding blood.
From now on, I am fertilizer for 'freedom';
While the will-o'-the-wisp still shines, kiss me once,
Then you raise this gun, and fix the bayonet."

Suddenly the will-o'-the-wisp shines like a lamp,
I recognize Ji Zhi, I'm shocked and stunned,
I kiss his arm, like kissing a piece of money,
I cannot suppress the sudden burst of sorrow.

The will-o'-the-wisp suddenly vanishes,
Gathering pitch blackness and silence;
Water seeps into my worn-out shoes,
Who knows if it's his blood, or my tears!

In the blink of an eye, everything changes,
I find myself in bed,
In the faint light,
I see only a tattered mat and a tattered curtain.

I remember that Ji Zhi has returned for rest,
So I have the joy of his rebirth,
Ji Zhi, and happy that you still have strength,
Your arms can still raise knives and guns!

### Symbolism is Not Ambiguity

— Ding Di

The advantage of using symbolism is that it allows for indirect expression of emotions or thoughts, using indirect, reverse methods to衬映, with shadows surpassing colors. Therefore, when there are obstacles to expressing reality, or when subtle and roundabout states of mind are difficult to express, one can certainly resort to symbolism. The ancient poems of the pre-Qin period, criticizing the policies of the king, those "that can complain," the "comparing things to express ambition" technique, "Flowers in the Mirror" with the adventures of Tang Ao and Duo Jiugong, and the land of giants and the land of Lilliputians in "Gulliver's Travels," all illustrate a kind of entrusting of mood, a kind of entrusting that is different from the sensitive nerve fibers of Verlaine, Baudelaire, and Li Changji. When there is no need to beat around the bush, it is naturally fine to talk frankly about your words, as Hugo said, "a free, sincere, and faithful verse, daring to speak or express everything without restraint." But if the facts make it impossible, then only the method of symbolism can import the subjective mood into an objective mood, using the latter as a tool and vessel for expression.

Symbolism is acceptable. Especially in the current environment. But symbolism must never get stuck in a dead end. Articles that are incomprehensible, lacking a definite center, consciousness, and backbone in content, and whose words are obscure and mysterious, that kind of emptiness and "showy but insubstantial" beauty, with a pretentious posture, pretending to be a classical gentleman, wearing a tall crown and a dazzling belt, is actually devoid of any spirit. Besides describing colors, saying that it can better describe Wei's "shadow" and France's "mystery," self-admiringly and foolishly, dragging a lot of irrelevant things into a pile, one moment the eyes see the emerald sea, the next moment they think of the ancestral cat's-eye gemstone at home, sighing and sighing (naturally I am not saying that these words should be avoided in articles) handling everything without a thread of connection. Perhaps the function of symbolism is obtained in irrelevant things, and arbitrary galloping, completing momentary impressions and intuitions: this is naturally their delusion, but it is still a delusion after all. I believe that Joyce's "Garbage Can" and Baudelaire's wide-open imagination of that kind of mystery are both undesirable. The complexity of feelings, to put it bluntly, is mental illness; the mental illness of unhealthy minds at the "end of the century." That kind of symbolism is not what we need, the symbolism of seeing ghosts and suspecting gods, the fragile symbolism, the symbolism that hides the true mood, where expression is no longer possible, covered by lengthy sentences, and whose mental illness is often easily transmitted to others.

In the current environment, we use "comparison" instead of the direct expression of "赋", using the objective mood as a conductor, this is our symbolism. But symbolism; never be ambiguous. Symbolism tells you not to be explicit, but we still hope that everyone can understand and appreciate it. We want to achieve the state of "not separated" set by Wang Guowei in "Words of the Human World." Symbolism is only a change in the way of conduction, the objective mood first catches the eye, and the subjective, basic mood is behind it. Despite adding a layer of method, the best symbolists do not allow the first layer, the realm expressed directly in words, to obscure the underlying layer. It can use a symbolic piece of glass to separate the subjective realm, the surface is separated, but you can still observe it. Outwardly "separated" but actually "not separated," this is the best symbolism. Outwardly "not separated" but actually already "separated," that is clumsy "赋."

There is no need to use symbolism to defend the ambiguity of words. Symbolism only adds a layer of surface realm, and the "inner, profound, reasonable, and correct" language is not abolished because of symbolism. Hugo tells us to penetrate deeply into the essence of the local language, directly search for its roots and stems, and thoroughly explore the etymology (see "Preface to Cromwell"), this saying hits the problem of literary men. "Words are smooth but the meaning is hindered" is only more annoying than "words harm but the principle is hidden." Especially symbolism, it adds another layer of objective mood, which needs to transform "separation" into "not separated," but without completely eliminating "separation." The dust on this piece of glass is certainly what we need to wipe well. The choice of objective mood must match that of the bottom layer. In addition, you must conduct the subjective mood (contained in the bottom layer) appropriately, like eight ounces matching half a catty. Even if there is a small, vague joint, it must be changed into clear words and sentences that do not lead to misunderstandings. "Examining the best in detail, determining whether to stay or go with the slightest distinction, if the weighing of the balance is just, it should certainly be required to be accurate." Lu Xiushuo's distinction between the meaning of words is especially useful in symbolism.

### Drum and Bugle

— Shen Yugang

My friend loves drums very much, and he seems to always be holding two drumsticks in his hand - actually, they are empty, but his desire to be a drummer is even stronger. Who knows, one day he might quietly slip away to a distant place to beat the drum.

I really don't understand: what's so fun about drums? Not to mention anything else, I object to the way it hangs around the neck. So awkward, so clumsy. And the sound of the drum is so monotonous, so boring. Like an old woman who likes to repeat herself.

I kind of like the bugle. There was a time when the sky had just revealed a layer of fish-belly white, and I was awakened by a crisp bugle sound. What kind of magic was that? Made me have such a good mood. Now I can't help but be surprised when I think about it. In the rising and falling bugle sound, a flag was raised, and a group of young people stood straight, hands on the brim of their hats. So solemn, so spirited. To this day, I still retain that sense of admiration for the bugle. It is an authority, in the ranks of battle.

For a long time, I had intended to write a short story entitled Bugle. The plot is quite simple, what I want to create is a strong atmosphere. It mainly tells the story of a young soldier standing on a mountaintop, blowing the charge bugle, chasing after the bugle sound disappearing in front, and the brothers victoriously rushing past. This brave bugler, however, becomes the target of the enemy. Until he rolled down from the top of the mountain, he was still holding the golden-yellow bugle in his hand.

What we should remember is that loyal heart.

Does this day make you tired? Feeling a little tired of life? Then why not change places. There, a regular life is arranged for you. The bugle sound tells you everything.

I long for the sound of the bugle, and I also have an ambition.

### Edison on the Silver Screen

— Yong

We all know that the initial inventor of the films screened on the silver screen today was the great American inventor Thomas Edison. Recently, the MGM company has decided to bring his life's achievements to the silver screen, so that later generations can further admire and strive to emulate this great man of the generation. It is reported that the role of Edison in the film has been decided to be played by Michael Lannon and Spencer Tracy, the former playing his youth, and the latter playing his adult life. The following are general facts about the care taken by the authorities during the production of the film:

In the film, there is a scene of a schoolhouse in Port Huron, Michigan, where Edison studied in his childhood. The classroom, desks, and the situation at that time are exactly the same.

There is also a scene of a laboratory, which is based on a picture from the book "Edison's Den." On the other hand, Edison's family members were also invited as consultants, which shows its authenticity.

### Teapot Studio Drama Talks

— Su Shaoqing

As the saying goes, "Every eating and drinking is predetermined." I, on the other hand, say, "It's more than just eating and drinking that's predetermined, watching and listening are also like that." Since the senior actor Guan Dayuan and the Hua Shan actress Zheng Bingru came on stage to update, I have been invited to watch by two good friends, but every time I have been unable to do so due to matters. Guan hasn't come south for ten years, so I really wanted to watch him. Yesterday, I was again invited to watch Guan's "Catching and Releasing Cao" and Zheng's "Jade Hall Spring," and managed to find the time to go. However, when I arrived, Chen Gong had already fled on horseback, and Cao Cao was also leading his horse down. I didn't hear a single sentence of Guan's singing. Isn't it predetermined that I shouldn't hear it? Fortunately, Zheng Bingru played Jade Hall Spring, starting from the escorting scene, then meeting with the trial, visiting the prison, and reunion. Her performance was effortless. I was satisfied with what I heard. Bingru's name is very unfamiliar, but with such achievements, she can be called an underdog. Her appearance and skill are unknown to most. I will now briefly describe her: Bingru's appearance is taller, her face is quite long, her voice is high and bright, like Xue Yanqin. Her singing method is skillful, especially in the use of pauses. Her tone is not specifically learned from any of the four famous Dan actresses. Upon careful listening, it is close to the Lanfang style, but the turns of the melody are strong and powerful, surpassing even Lanfang, probably because she is a woman who is naturally strong. The more she sings, the brighter and higher her voice becomes. Her Erhuang in the Western Slope is even better. Her inner strength and endurance are probably naturally endowed. When she sings the running-water rhythm, she has a special feature, that is, the tempo is faster than any male or female actor singing Jade Hall Spring.

Moreover, she has a method of stopping and starting abruptly, and her enunciation is clearer, which comes from hard work and is commendable. Looking at her posture, there are both strengths and weaknesses in her expression. I heard that in her Western Slope Yuan Ban, the first word of each phrase (pronounced like a comma) has an extra low note, sticky but not crisp, which is exactly the same as Hou Yulan's problem in singing Yuan Ban. She should pay attention to correcting it, and then it will be perfect. Bingru is a woman after all. The advertisement in the newspaper only says "civil and military Qingyi Hua Shan," but does not specify Kun Jiao (female actor). I don't know why. Does she consider herself a heroine and not admit to being a woman? I strongly agree with this point. Actors should rely on selling their skills, and only discuss the merits of the skills, why must they be divided into men and women? Those who use their femininity as a selling point have the suspicion of pleasing people with their appearance. It is said that Bingru is from Shandong. Before this update, there was also Wu Suqiu, who was also from Shandong, and both are hometown relatives of General Wu Ziyu. Both have a firm and unyielding ambition. Shandong can be said to have talent. The "Bing" character in Bingru's name seems to be pronounced as the "Ning" character. If it is read as the original sound of the "Bing" character, as in ice and snow, it seems that it should be changed to Zheng Rubing. This is just idle talk, I don't know if it is appropriate. Her Qin player drags properly and can lift Bingru's singing, making people cheer. He is really a very good Qin player. Looking at him from afar, he seems to be named Wang Wenzhi. Counting the famous Qin players in Tianjin, it is not Wang Wenzhi who can pull the bow so full and so fast.

### Thoughts from My Daughter's Reading, Related to the Soviet Union's Children's Theater (Part 2)

— Li Feishu

During the intermission, we were led backstage by the theater's host for a tour. Many puppets were on display, lively as living people when on stage. Once away from the puppeteers, they all hung their heads and hands, becoming corpses! This backstage can be considered their graveyard. From this, I also realized the illusion of life. The so-called "life foundation" and "soul" are all temporarily lent to you by nature. When "Heaven deprives their soul, and Earth strips their spirit," no matter whether you are loyal or treacherous, good or evil, who is not like the puppets backstage? This backstage can be called "an exhibition of life after homecoming."

There are very few people backstage. One or two are dedicated to applying makeup to the puppets. There are only two puppeteers. With one or two people's voices and wrist movements, they imitate the voices and actions of various classes of people in society, and all kinds of different personalities, and they do it vividly and realistically. The high level of their art and the flexibility of their skills are truly admirable!

The audience in this theater is naturally only children. But the order is so good! It is beyond expectation. There is neither the sound of "chewing gum with a clicking noise," nor the sound of "whispering sweet words," let alone "crying." However, the innocent laughter of the children often sweetly fills the ears, because the play is full of jokes, which are used to attract children's interest, so that they learn the lesson of "hating laziness and admiring diligence" unconsciously while having fun and laughing.

The children's theater is provided to children for free in stages, and some seats are ticketed, but the prices are extremely cheap. This is because the children's theater is not only a place "specially for entertainment," but also the most effective "education implementation" agency; at the same time, it can also be regarded as a factory for manufacturing Soviet "E children with Soviet ideology.

When the puppeteer, relying on a wooden actor, introduced Mr. Mei to the children in the audience, the children all stood up and applauded and cheered! Mr. Mei smiled and thanked them as the lights shined on him. It happened that a child, only six or seven years old, was too short to see Mr. Mei's style, so he stood on the seat. He also expressed his welcome to the guests, clapping his little hands vigorously. Inadvertently, he slipped and fell, but he did not cry. After standing up, he still applauded as before, which was really interesting!

After the play, the children surrounded Mr. Mei, asking him to sign their small notebooks. There was also a little girl who wanted us to leave the Chinese communication address. She said: "Later, she will write letters to Chinese children, and ask Chinese children to write letters to them too."

"Writing letters"! How can one write letters without studying? Holding the pen at this point, the "future education problems of Jing" came to my mind again!

This game was played last Tuesday at the Hualian Tongle Club. The result of the two games played with alternating first moves was a draw. There were over three hundred spectators, including senior figures from the orange industry such as Wang Yunzhong and Ai Guofan, creating a grand scene for a time. Furthermore, the renowned Yuan Lidun personally wrote two middle screens and presented them to the two gentlemen, Dou and Luo.
