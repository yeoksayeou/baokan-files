Two to three thousand Japanese troops in Yongning, including some puppet troops, have been searching for and massacring Chinese civilians in recent days. More than two thousand Japanese troops from Jiandao Xu in the east of the city advanced north along the Yongbin Road on the 28th, seemingly as reinforcements, but have been repelled by the Chinese army and cannot advance further. Yongwu is where the main force of the Japanese army is located, and its vanguard stopped at Santang, also making no progress. There are tens of thousands of Japanese troops between Yongning and Qinzhou, who are currently moving north. (Dispatch from the 29th)

Guilin: After the Japanese occupation of Nanning, although they attempted to find outlying strongholds to the north and northeast, several days of fighting have proven that the Japanese forces are exhausted. The Chinese army now occupies favorable terrain, and its defensive strength has also been rapidly enhanced.

(Special dispatch from the 29th)

Chongqing: According to a military spokesperson, after landing in Fangcheng and Qinzhou with several divisions, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack inland. The Chinese army is giving them a strong frontal blow on one hand, and using the tactic of luring the enemy deep on the other hand, to encircle the Japanese army and trap them on a long, narrow corridor. On the 23rd of this month, the Japanese army forcibly crossed the Yu River and engaged in several days and nights of bloody battles with the defending Chinese troops near Nanning in southern Guangxi. The Japanese army frequently reinforced its troops in the Chinese encirclement. On the 24th, they approached the suburbs of Nanning, and the fighting was extremely fierce. However, because the area near Nanning is a vast plain, the Chinese army had no strategic advantages to defend, and having achieved the strategic goals of attrition and successfully luring the enemy deep, they shifted positions on the morning of the 26th. Currently, the Chinese army is in a stalemate with the Japanese army in the vicinity of ××. The Japanese army's rear lines have been cut off by the Chinese, and the advancing troops are panicking and their momentum has been blunted. The Chinese army will adopt a calm attitude to encircle and annihilate the Japanese army from all sides. The Japanese army, unable to retreat and unable to advance, will inevitably suffer the most tragic fate of annihilation. (Dispatch from the 28th)

Zhaoqing: Along the Jianghui line, Chinese and Japanese troops are constantly engaging in contact. The Chinese army has launched a full-scale offensive since the 24th, but has suffered repeated defeats in the past week and has lost its fighting spirit.

American Highway Expert Claims Southwest Transportation Unaffected

Chongqing: According to Mr. Shia-han, an American highway expert and highway consultant to the National Government, the Japanese occupation of Nanning does not affect China's highway transportation in the southwest. The shorter highway between Chongqing and Hanoi, Annam, is now largely completed. At the same time, China is striving to build more new highways. Currently, the southwestern part of China is still in the rainy season, but the rainy season will soon pass, and all goods can be smoothly transported to Chongqing without any restrictions. Even during the rainy season, although the Yunnan-Burma Highway is sometimes washed out by mountain floods, transportation has never been interrupted. He also stated that the highway passing through Nanning has been abandoned for several months and has mostly been turned into a swamp. The road has even been converted into rice paddies and is completely useless. He also said that although there are many stone-based paths in Guangxi, they have all been used for hundreds of years and cannot be compared to modern highways. However, a new modern highway will be completed in the middle of next month. This road is 200 kilometers shorter than the one passing through Nanning, and the construction work is much better than the former. The road starts from Dongtun (transliteration), a railway station on the Annam border, and passes through Hechi in northern Guangxi. According to reports, Hechi is located 200 kilometers northwest of Nanning, so it is far from the Japanese army. In addition, there are at least four public roads in southwestern China that are currently being rushed to completion. (United Press dispatch from the 9th)

Editorial

### From a Penny Shortage to a Dime Shortage

Shanghai used to be China's economic center. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the industry and commerce of Nanshi and Zhabei were completely destroyed by artillery fire. However, due to the concentration of population in the concessions and the influx of floating capital from the occupied areas, all economic activities showed a prosperous appearance. Unfortunately, those who attempted to seize Shanghai's economic rights did not hesitate to use various methods to undermine Shanghai's economic stability. A few unscrupulous merchants took advantage of this to create opportunities for personal gain. Taking the currency situation as an example, not long ago, the Shanghai concessions suffered from a shortage of copper pennies due to hoarding, which caused social unrest. Recently, a dime shortage has occurred, causing inconvenience and anxiety for the lives of millions of residents. The means of those who attempt to seize Shanghai's economic rights are vicious, and the unscrupulous merchants who assist them in their evil deeds are even more to be condemned.

The panic caused by the dime shortage has too many impacts on society. Since the circulation of pennies in the market suddenly decreased in June of this year, the lowest transaction unit has often increased from a few cents to a dime, which has invisibly raised the living standards of residents. Now that there is a shortage of dimes, although it will not cause the standard of the lowest transaction to increase from dimes to yuan, in fact, many stores have restricted the issuance and acceptance of change during transactions. At a time when prices are soaring, ordinary residents can no longer bear the burden of life, how can they suffer significant losses on dimes again? Especially small merchants who rely on retail trade, as well as the working class who earn a few dimes a day, such as rickshaw pullers, it is extremely cruel to reduce their business and work opportunities as a result.

Even those in the financial industry are unclear about the reason for the sudden shortage of dimes. It is believed that it is due to the influx into the occupied areas and the manipulation of evil forces. Since copper coins were hoarded in the occupied areas, there was a severe shortage of subsidiary currency, and they could not but demand supply from Shanghai. Moreover, the puppet organization's commencement of issuing fake copper coin notes did not alleviate the panic, but rather prompted the general public's psychology, from trusting the government's dimes, to increasing the need for dimes. As for the so-called manipulation of evil forces, it is believed that the failure of the plan to infiltrate the concessions with counterfeit currency has caused a shortage of subsidiary currency, leaving room for expanding the scope of use of counterfeit subsidiary currency, in the hope that counterfeit subsidiary currency will become the trigger for circulating counterfeit currency.

The vast majority of all panics are caused by psychology, and all market prices are often affected by people's minds. Shanghai residents do not need to panic about the shortage of dimes. Subsidiary currency is only used to facilitate transactions below the legal currency unit. If those who attempt to undermine the legal currency system cannot defeat the legal currency, then manipulating subsidiary currency is of little use and of little significance. Moreover, dimes and pennies are different. Pennies are made of copper, and copper can be used to make guns and bullets, so they will be plundered. However, the dimes in circulation recently are all paper, and besides assisting legal currency, they have no other use. Furthermore, the Shanghai financial community has already discussed appropriate remedial measures. The banks that issued dimes in the past will not only issue as much of their existing dime reserves as possible but will also request their head offices to quickly print new notes. It is expected that this shortage will soon be completely eliminated. What is currently hoped for by the general public is that they will not repeat the mistake of storing large amounts of dimes themselves due to the temporary inconvenience in the past, which will increase the severity of the panic. At the same time, it is hoped that those in the opium and exchange industries will be careful not to manipulate and hoard due to this, deliberately suppressing exchange rates, and committing the sin of taking advantage of the disaster.

Due to the recurrence of the subsidiary currency panic, we cannot but demand that the National Government formulate an effective adjustment plan for the currency in the occupied areas so that the people will not be greatly affected by temporary problems. For example, the issuance of penny notes, which the citizens of Shanghai eagerly desire, has not yet been supplied in large quantities, and various substitute notes are still everywhere. This is something that should have been planned and resolved long ago. Whether the resolution is swift or satisfactory reflects the efficiency of those in charge. Currently, Chinese military affairs are at war, and currency is also at war. The currency war in the occupied areas has reached a fever pitch. If the sudden decrease in dimes in Shanghai is due to a large influx into the occupied areas, it can also be seen as an expression of the people's loyalty and love for the government. From this point of view, it undoubtedly illustrates the foundation of China's final victory.

### Germany Claims to Have Sunk a British 10,000-ton Cruiser; German Officer Captain White Received Medal; British Admiralty Officially Denies This; British Ship Rubislaw Sunk by Mine

Berlin: German officials announced last night that a British cruiser of more than 10,000 tons was sunk by a German submarine. The successful German submarine was commanded by Captain White, "the young hero of the Scarborough incident." The British ship was of the London class, built in 1929, and normally carried 650 crew members and many officers. Authoritative sources claim that about 700 people were killed when the ship was sunk. This is the tenth major naval victory for Germany since the war began. The British ship had eight 8-inch guns, eight 4-inch guns, twenty small guns, eight torpedo launchers, and an aircraft elevator. The ship was sunk near Orkney. Captain White is only 30 years old, a handsome young man, and one of the outstanding talents in the navy. Hitler personally awarded him a medal. When British Naval Secretary Churchill reported to the House of Commons on the sinking of the Royal Oak, he also praised White's skills. (United Press dispatch from the 29th)

London: The Germans broadcast last night that a British heavy cruiser had been torpedoed and destroyed east of the Shetland Islands. The submarine that launched the torpedo was commanded by Major Prien, who had previously sunk the British ship Royal Oak. This information has not been confirmed by officials here. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)

London: German sources claim that their submarines have sunk another British 10,000-ton cruiser. The Admiralty has formally denied this. Informed sources say that when German radio stations broadcast the news, they initially claimed that what was sunk was a British destroyer, and then said it was a cruiser. Their intention was obviously to provoke the British authorities to issue a denial, so as to find out where this warship is now. This is no different from the previous German propaganda that the British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" had been sunk. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)

Berlin: According to a German High Command communique yesterday, the British Navy in the North Sea and North Atlantic has withdrawn. The reason is that many ships on the British coast have sunk after hitting mines, and they are deeply afraid of German submarine attacks and aircraft air raids. After the British Navy withdrew, the German Navy was able to move freely. The British loss of a deputy cruiser in the naval battle near the Water Islands is clear evidence. Lloyd George's so-called withdrawal of British naval forces from the North Sea has been proven by this battle. At the very least, Britain has many weaknesses at sea. (United Press dispatch from the 29th)

London: Yesterday, the British ship Rubislaw (1,023 tons) sank after hitting a mine off the southeast coast of Britain. Thirteen crew members are missing, and four were rescued by British minesweepers and have been sent to hospitals. The ship belonged to the Granite Company and was launched in Aberdeen in 1905. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)

Berlin: The German News Agency announced today that, according to those who witnessed the sinking of the British armed merchant ship Rawalpindi, there were terrifying explosions in succession after the Germans opened fire. The ship's ammunition exploded, and the entire ship was engulfed in flames. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)

Amsterdam: Newspapers here are becoming increasingly agitated about the German mine warfare. Dutch newspapers, in particular, expressed consternation and indignation at the German interpretation of Dutch neutrality. Many asked what actions Germany expected of the Netherlands. Officials now suspect that Germany wants the Netherlands to escort ships carrying German goods. One local newspaper said that although Germany uses mines and submarines, Britain still patrols the sea and Germany has failed to stop it. Germany would rather leave its cargo ships in the country than let them go to sea and be attacked by British warships. The neutral country cannot do what Germany, with its powerful war machine, cannot do. Dutch ships bound for Norway, another neutral country, were even treated to torpedoes by German submarines, without any assistance being given to the crew. It can be seen that they have never shown the slightest respect for the rights of neutral countries. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)

### Anglo-German Air Battle off the British Coast; Two German Aircraft Shot Down

London: Today, two German aircraft were shot down by British fighters near the British coast. This is the 24th and 25th German aircraft shot down in or near British territory since the German air raid on the Firth of Forth on October 16. One crashed five miles off the coast of Northumberland. The other, a Heinkel bomber, crashed further off the northeast coast. The Heinkel was intercepted by a British fighter as it approached the British coast. After a dramatic dogfight, it was hit and caught fire, falling into the sea. The cloud cover was very low at the time, and the British pilot almost crashed into the sea, but managed to pull up just in time to avoid disaster. The other German aircraft was shot down by several British fighters. Many people witnessed the British aircraft taking off to fight. After the dogfight ended, a lifeboat was immediately dispatched to sea. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)

Oslo: Residents in the vicinity of Staalund in southwest Norway reported that there had been intense naval battles outside Norwegian territorial waters around 11 o'clock this morning. It seemed to be fighting between aircraft and warships. At noon, the flashing lights of artillery could clearly be seen, and the booming sounds of heavy artillery were very clear. Some people think this was an attack by German aircraft on British ships. (United Press dispatch from the 29th)

### British Planes Invade, Attack German Air Force Base, Engage German Aircraft

London: The Air Ministry announced, "A squadron of our fighter planes departed this afternoon to search for German seaplanes laying mines. They flew directly to the German seaplane base at Borkum Island (in the North Sea, part of the East Frisian Islands). They encountered three German aircraft and engaged them. The island's anti-aircraft batteries also fired at our planes. Afterward, all our planes returned safely to base." (Havas News Agency, 28th)

Berlin: An official report released here last night stated, "Several British aircraft attempted to intrude into German airspace from the northwest between the night of November 27th and the 28th, but were unsuccessful. At that time, one British plane suddenly turned towards the sea and sent out distress signals. Due to the severe weather and high waves, it is presumed the plane was lost. Another British plane, seeing the treacherous sea conditions, flew towards Dutch airspace." (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

Berlin: It was announced here last night that British aircraft flew over the German air force base at Borkum Island in the North Sea yesterday afternoon and carried out an air raid. The British planes did not drop bombs but only strafed with machine guns. They were repelled by German aircraft. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

Berlin: German officials announced yesterday that British air forces attacked the German northwest coast on Monday but were repelled. One British plane was forced to land in the North Sea. (According to a London announcement from the British Air Ministry, Royal Air Force reconnaissance of the German northwest coast on Monday night was very successful). Official sources also said that British planes attempted to attack the White Roosters airfield but were repelled by machine-gun fire. (United Press, 29th)

London: Qualified observers here are currently comparing the strengths and weaknesses of British and German air force equipment, commenting that the British air force is indeed superior to the German air force. For example, British bombers have gun turrets powered by powerful engines, allowing gunners to rotate freely in any direction effortlessly. German planes do not have such turrets, relying solely on agility and evasion, as it is difficult for gunners to hold machine guns steady at current aircraft speeds. The British eight-gun fighter has proven very successful, while the German four-gun fighter has certain shortcomings. A captured Messerschmitt Bf 109 German aircraft was recently tested and proven to be an inferior plane. (Reuters, 29th)

Berlin: According to an official German High Command communiqué today, British planes again attempted to fly over Vlieland Island and intrude into northern German airspace, but did not reach the German coast. The Borkum Island airfield was attacked but suffered no damage. As for the Western Front, there was little to report today. (United Press, 29th)

### British Merchant Ship Losses Announced by British Admiralty

London: The Admiralty has released figures on recent British merchant ship losses to counter German broadcasting exaggerations. According to these figures, in the week ending at midnight on the 25th of this month, British losses totaled eleven merchant ships, amounting to 25,787 tons. The total loss of merchant ships from the start of the war to the 25th of this month is 78 British ships totaling 288,169 tons, 10 French ships totaling 51,150 tons, and 43 neutral ships totaling 144,592 tons. These figures can be compared with the situation in April 1917, when a total of 430 ships of all nations were sunk, amounting to 852,000 tons, of which 196 British ships alone were sunk, amounting to 522,000 tons. There is a recent tendency for German submarine commanders to attack unprotected fishing boats in areas where they are unlikely to immediately encounter British naval opposition. Although only four neutral ships were lost due to German actions in the past week, their tonnage is almost as large as the British losses, as the neutral ships sunk included large vessels such as the Terukuni Maru, the Grazia, and the Slaterite. (Reuters, 29th)

### Foreign Planes Invade Belgian Airspace

Brussels: Between 12:00 noon and 1:00 PM yesterday, foreign aircraft of unknown nationality intruded into Belgian airspace. Anti-aircraft batteries in Mechelen, Brussels, Ghent, and Bruges opened fire. Belgian fighter planes scrambled, but because the foreign aircraft were flying at an altitude of over 10,000 meters, the Belgian planes could not force them to land. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

Brussels: Several foreign planes were spotted over the city yesterday at noon, flying at high altitude and hidden in the clouds. The garrison opened anti-aircraft fire, and the planes flew west. (United Press, 29th)

Brussels: This morning, several planes of unknown nationality flew into Belgian territory, passing over the cities of Mariakerke, Ghent, Bruges, and Ostend. Anti-aircraft batteries in these locations fired upon them. Several Belgian fighter planes also scrambled into the air. (Havas News Agency, 28th)

Brussels: Several planes of unknown nationality flew over Brussels last night at an altitude of around 15,000 meters. Anti-aircraft guns opened fire, and Belgian fighter planes also took off.

### Japan Urges Soviet Union to Reopen Fisheries Negotiations, Soviet Ambassador to Japan Awaiting Instructions

Tokyo: Japan previously invited the Soviet government to begin fisheries agreement negotiations, but has not received a response from the Soviet side. The Japanese government yesterday urged the Soviet Union to hold new fisheries agreement negotiations as soon as possible. At the same time, Japanese newspapers are taking a conciliatory attitude towards the Soviet Union, and Tokyo "political observers" are paying attention to the Soviet attitude towards the fisheries issue. "They believe that this attitude can indicate the Soviet Union's sincerity in adjusting Soviet-Japanese relations." As for the Soviet side, the only indication of its attitude towards the fisheries issue is that it has not responded to Japan's invitation to negotiate a new agreement. Japanese Foreign Minister Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura invited Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin to the Foreign Ministry yesterday, urging the Soviet Union to pay attention to the fact that it had not responded to Japan's proposal on November 15th. At that time, Nomura suggested to the Soviet ambassador that negotiations on a new fisheries agreement were "the first step in adjusting Soviet-Japanese relations." It is said that Smetanin informed Nomura yesterday that he had not received instructions from Moscow, but that he would urge his government to pay attention. (United Press, 29th)

Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun reported today on the results of the first meeting between Foreign Minister Nomura and Soviet Ambassador Smetanin on November 15th, saying that the Soviet ambassador had informally informed Nomura that the Soviet Union did not object to holding fisheries issue negotiations in Tokyo, but that he did not comment on Nomura's proposal to amend the long-term fisheries agreement of 1928. Nomura invited the Soviet ambassador to the Foreign Ministry yesterday afternoon, urging the Soviet side to make a definite decision. Smetanin replied that he had not yet received instructions from Moscow. However, it is said that Smetanin expressed the Soviet government's willingness to negotiate various pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union in order to seek a solution, and said that the progress of future negotiations would depend entirely on whether Japan was willing to provide sufficient evidence to show its readiness to conduct negotiations in a truly friendly spirit. Nomura said that this matter should be studied in detail, and that he would ask him to come and talk again later. (Reuters, 29th)

### Japanese Troops Continue Blockade of Tianjin Concessions, Suma Issues Statement

Tokyo: When Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma greeted newspaper reporters this morning, a foreign reporter asked about the reason for the Japanese side's continued blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin. He replied that Lieutenant General Honma, commander of the Japanese troops in Tianjin, believed that the blockade was still necessary to guarantee the peace, order, and tranquility of the area. Suma recently returned from North China, and according to the impressions he shared with the reporters, he was most impressed by the Japanese army's firm efforts to protect the interests of third countries, especially in Nanjing and Tianjin. Japanese people and foreigners are in extremely friendly contact, and the Japanese army is currently doing its best to alleviate the situation at various barriers in Tianjin. (Reuters, 29th)

Especially in the House of Representatives, all parties, large and small, should unanimously support the current cabinet in handling the incident. In his opinion, it would be more effective for him to exert his efforts from outside the cabinet. (Domei News Agency, 29th)

### Soviet Union Unilaterally Abrogates Non-Aggression Treaty, Soviet-Finnish Relations Deteriorate Further, Soviet Union Renews Demand for Finnish Military Withdrawal from Border, Course of Events Depends on Attitude of Finnish Government

Moscow: People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov and Deputy Commissar Potemkin received Finnish Minister to the Soviet Union Yrjö-Koskinen this afternoon and held talks for 20 minutes. They handed over a note to Minister Yrjö-Koskinen, declaring the abrogation of the 1932 Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty on the grounds that the Finnish government was pursuing anti-Soviet policies. (Havas News Agency, 28th)

Moscow: The Soviet Union yesterday announced the abrogation of the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Pact, effective immediately, and reiterated its demand that Finnish troops withdraw from the Soviet-Finnish border. Sources here indicate the Soviet-Finnish crisis is on the verge of eruption. The Red Army stationed in Finland was ordered last night to retaliate against Finland and "annihilate" those responsible for firing guns. Soviet sources in the Leningrad region claimed that the Red Army was preparing for action and that the Soviet Navy concentrated in Leningrad was also preparing for "various incidents." Molotov's demand to Finland for Finnish troops to withdraw from the border cannot be seen as a "fait accompli," as the date of withdrawal was not specified. He told the Finnish minister that the Soviet Union had abrogated the non-aggression pact because Finland's anti-Soviet policies were inconsistent with the pact. Hostilities have already occurred on two parts of the border, one in the Pacific and the other near Leningrad. Some believe that if another Finnish government is formed that accepts Soviet territorial demands, a peaceful resolution is still possible. (United Press, 29th)

Berlin: According to a Moscow dispatch, Moscow political circles believe that while the Soviet Union's announcement of the abrogation of the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Pact has greatly increased tensions, it does not necessarily mean that armed conflict is imminent. The nature of this Soviet action is the final urgent warning to Finland, and future developments will depend on the Finnish government's attitude towards the Soviet note. (Reuters, 29th)

Helsinki: Political figures here believe that the Soviet government's announcement of the abrogation of the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty is for domestic propaganda and to force Finland to reopen negotiations. (Havas News Agency, 28th)

### Finland Responds to Soviet Note of Abrogation, Contents Not Yet Published, Troops Ordered to Withdraw Several Miles

Helsinki: The Finnish government has replied to the Soviet note abrogating the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Agreement. The reply was issued after a lengthy cabinet meeting and the contents have not yet been released. It is believed here that the Soviet Union abrogated the agreement in order to prompt Finland to continue talks with the Soviet Union. At the same time, it is reported that Finnish patrol units have been ordered to withdraw a certain distance from the border. According to a statement released here, an investigation by the authorities has shown that the border guards in Salmi on the north shore of Lake Ladoga have no knowledge of the alleged border atrocities mentioned by the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 29th)

Helsinki: After the Soviet Union announced the abrogation of the 1932 Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty, the Finnish government submitted a reply to the Soviet government this morning, the contents of which have not been published. The Finnish authorities took various military precautionary measures six weeks ago, and have not since taken any further special measures. The issue of canceling military officers' leave has been discussed, but not implemented. (Havas News Agency, 29th)

### Baltic States Express Concern

Riga: The Baltic Sea coastal states are quite concerned about the Soviet Union's abrogation of the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

### Finland Determined to Resist Foreign Aggression, Confident in Extremely Sound Position, Cannot Be Subdued by Intimidation

Helsinki: According to Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko to a US news agency reporter today, Finland is very willing to reach an amicable solution with the Soviet Union, but the news coming from Moscow is truly discouraging. However, Finland is now prepared to exert all its strength to resist foreign aggression. (United Press, 29th)

Helsinki: Officials here have not criticized the Soviet Union's abrogation of the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty, but are discussing how to deal with the situation. Before Finland received the Soviet Union's note abrogating the Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty, a Finnish government spokesman stated, "We are deeply aware that our position is extremely sound and we will not be intimidated by anyone, regardless of what intimidation the Soviet side makes." (United Press, 29th)

Helsinki: Diplomatic circles here reported that after the Soviet government refused to agree to the simultaneous withdrawal of border forces and announced the abrogation of the 1932 Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty yesterday, Finland's security and independence could only be guaranteed by its own military strength. Finland is a small country with only seven well-equipped and well-trained army divisions. As for fortifications, a line of defense known as the "Mannerheim Line" has been built between Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Finland (i.e., the Karelian Isthmus). This line of defense was created under the leadership of General Mannerheim, a founding father of Finland and current chairman of the National Defense Council. Since leading his comrades to defeat the Russian army and restore independence in 1918, he has devoted all his efforts to strengthening military preparedness and building this line of defense in the Karelian Isthmus, cutting off the only route for the Soviet Union to invade Finland. The general is known as the "uncrowned emperor of Finland" and is the commander of the country's elite army. He is now defending independence just as he led the entire nation to defend the homeland twenty years ago. (Havas News Agency, 29th)

### Red Army Concentrated on Western Border, Air Force Increased to Three Thousand Aircraft, Navy Also on Standby

Danzig: According to a dispatch from the Helsinki correspondent of the local conservative newspaper "Berlingske Tidende" today, Soviet activity has been exceptionally high in recent days at the five major military airfields in western Russia and at other bases in the Baltic states. Soviet airmen in the region have received orders from the Leningrad military authorities to be ready to move at any time. At the same time, the Soviet Navy near the Karelian Isthmus is also standing by, ready for action. A news agency reports that the Soviet Air Force in the west has now increased to 3,500 aircraft. In peacetime, there are 500 Soviet aircraft in the Leningrad area and 10 infantry divisions. At present, Finland has only 150 fighter planes, including 50 bombers. (United Press, 29th)

### Soviet Anti-Finnish Propaganda Extremely Threatening, Accuses Finnish Defense Forces of Firing Provocatively, Insults Finnish Authorities as Mad Dogs

Moscow: According to a report from the Leningrad Military District Headquarters, at 5:00 PM on the 28th, five Finnish soldiers, upon seeing a Soviet patrol patrolling the national border area on the isthmus between the Rybachy and Sredny Peninsulas, opened fire and attempted to arrest them. The Soviet patrol immediately retreated, and a unit of Soviet reinforcements arrived, driving the Finnish soldiers out of the area. During the attack, three Finnish soldiers were captured, and the rest fled back into Finnish territory. The Soviets suffered no casualties. The Soviets seized two rifles, one pistol, two binoculars, one signal pistol, and multiple bullets from the Finnish prisoners. Afterwards, the Soviets strengthened border defenses in the area. At 6:00 PM on the same day, Finnish soldiers near hill 204.2 fired five rounds of rifle fire into Soviet territory. The Soviet army did not return fire. According to a report from the Leningrad Military District Headquarters, on the same day, the Finnish army also fired two artillery rounds from the Kasnaselka area in the Vidritsa region. The shells exploded in Soviet territory 500 meters east of border marker 367 (7 kilometers from Kolatselkä). Afterwards, a small group of Finnish soldiers attempted to cross the border in the area of the aforementioned border marker, but immediately retreated back into Finnish territory after encountering Soviet rifle and machine-gun fire. (TASS, 29th)

Moscow: Local radio stations have been conducting a propaganda campaign against Finland with all their might. It has reached its peak today. When broadcasting the news this morning, the announcer insulted the Finnish government authorities as "mad dogs" and said that all officers and soldiers of the Soviet Navy and Air Force in the Baltic Sea were awaiting orders from their superiors, ready to give the frantic Finnish elements the last lesson. "The Soviet government's announcement of the abrogation of the 1932 Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty has been unanimously approved by the people of the country." In addition, the announcer also reported the resolutions passed by various labor groups, the gist of which was, "Many Soviet soldiers have been killed by Finnish bandits, and we must avenge them." (Havas News Agency, 29th)

### Contents of Soviet-Finnish Exchange of Notes

Moscow: After receiving the Finnish government's reply to the Soviet government's note of the 26th, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov received Finnish Minister to the Soviet Union Yrjö-Koskinen today (28th) and handed him the Soviet government's reply to the Finnish reply. The texts of the two replies are as follows:

### Soviet Note

The Soviet side recently replied, stating, "Your Excellency, Minister, I have received Your Government's reply to our note of the sixth of this month, and I understand it fully. Your reply demonstrates Your Government's deep-seated hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union, the effect of which is only to cause a severe and extreme deterioration in relations between the two countries.

Firstly, Your Government's denial of the act of Your country's troops opening fire and shelling Soviet troops, causing deaths and injuries, has no other purpose than to attempt to confuse public opinion and insult the victims of the shelling. Only by holding fast to an irresponsible and contemptuous attitude towards public opinion can Your side attempt to explain this abhorrent shelling incident by saying that the Soviet army was 'practicing artillery target shooting' near the border in front of Finnish soldiers.

Secondly, Your Government's refusal to withdraw the troops who flagrantly shelled the Soviet troops, and the pretext of the principle of equality between the two sides, demanding that the Soviet and Finnish troops withdraw simultaneously, demonstrates Your Government's intention to continue to place Leningrad under threat. In fact, the positions of the Soviet and Finnish armies are not equal; on the contrary, the Finnish army is in an advantageous position, because the Soviet army is hundreds of kilometers away from Finland's important urban centers and poses no threat, while the Finnish troops are stationed only 32 kilometers away from Leningrad, an important Soviet center with a population of 3.5 million, posing a direct threat to the city. In short, the Soviet army has no room to retreat 65 kilometers, because the Soviet army would then retreat to the outskirts of Leningrad, which would be absurd in terms of guaranteeing the city's security. As for the Soviet government's proposal that the Finnish army withdraw 20 to 25 kilometers, it is a minimum requirement, and its purpose is not to eliminate the inequality between the positions of the two armies, but to reduce it slightly. If the Finnish government refuses even this minimum proposal, it proves that Your Government intends to place Leningrad under the direct threat of Your army.

Thirdly, the Finnish government's concentration of a large number of regular troops near Leningrad, thereby placing the Soviet Union's most important urban center under direct threat, constitutes a hostile act against the Soviet Union and conflicts with the non-aggression pact previously concluded between the two countries. Furthermore, the Finnish government's refusal to withdraw the Finnish troops at least 20 to 25 kilometers after the Finnish troops flagrantly shelled the Soviet army shows that Your Government continues to maintain a hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union and has no intention of considering the terms of the non-aggression pact, but has decided to continue to place Leningrad under threat in the future. The Soviet government cannot tolerate this situation in which one side violates the non-aggression pact and the other side must abide by it. Therefore, the Soviet government considers it necessary to declare that from this day forward, it is no longer bound by the obligations of the non-aggression pact previously signed by the Soviet Union and Finland and repeatedly violated by the Finnish government. This announcement is made and I respectfully offer my best regards, V.M. Molotov, People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union.

### Finnish Note

The Finnish government replied to the Soviet note of the 26th of this month, stating, "Your Excellency, People's Commissar, Regarding Your Excellency's note of the 26th of this month, I have now received instructions from my government to reply as follows: Regarding the alleged border violation incident, my government has immediately conducted a thorough investigation. It has been verified that the shells mentioned in Your letter were not fired from Finnish territory. On the contrary, according to the investigation, the shots fired between 3:45 PM and 4:05 PM Soviet time on the 26th of November were fired from near the village of Mainila mentioned in Your letter in Soviet territory, within Finnish territory. Personnel also witnessed the point of explosion of the shells, because the village of Mainila is only 800 meters from the border, separated by a plain. Based on the speed of sound of the seven artillery shells, it can be determined that the positions of the artillery that fired the shells were located 1.5 to 2 kilometers southeast of the point of explosion of the shells. When this incident occurred, the Finnish border guards had already recorded their observations of the above-mentioned shelling in their diaries. Therefore, it seems that this incident may have been an accidental incident during a Soviet artillery practice, which caused the deaths and injuries mentioned in Your letter. Therefore, I feel compelled to reject the protest mentioned in Your letter and declare that Finland has not engaged in the hostile actions against the Soviet Union that You mentioned. Your letter also mentioned the danger of concentrating regular troops near the border of Leningrad, which You mentioned during the meetings with Mr. Paasikivi and Mr. Tanner in Moscow. Regarding this point, I would like to draw Your attention to the following facts: The troops stationed on the Finnish border are mainly border guards, and in that area, there are no artillery pieces with a range long enough for shells to land across the border. Although there is no real reason to withdraw troops from the border according to Your suggestion, my government is still willing to begin discussions on the issue of both sides withdrawing troops a certain distance from the border. I am pleased to note that Your Excellency stated that the Soviet government does not intend to magnify the importance of the border incident that You mentioned in Your letter, and I am comforted that I was able to clarify this misunderstanding on the day I received Your Excellency's suggestion. In order to thoroughly clarify everything, my government now suggests ordering the border commissioners of both sides in the Karelian Isthmus to investigate this incident in accordance with the border committee convention signed on the 24th of September, 1928. This is a reply, and I offer my respectful regards, Yrjö K. Koskinen." (TASS dispatch of the 28th)

### Chamberlain Reiterates England's War Aims Against Germany: Winning Victory to Eliminate Threats to All Countries; Says Imperialism is Absolutely Not a Characteristic of England

London: When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in response to questions raised by Labour Party leader Major Attlee, stating, "Some people view this decisive battle as solely a war of encirclement. In terms of land, this view may be accurate, but at sea, the situation is completely different. Both sides are engaged in a life-or-death struggle. Our auxiliary cruiser 'Rawalpindi,' manned by officers and men of the naval reserve, fought bravely against a German warship in the North Sea with a disparity in strength, which is truly inspiring. Regarding the methods of naval warfare, international conventions have been established, all based on humanitarianism. Unfortunately, the enemy seems to have no concept of honor. The two allied nations of England and France have no choice but to take various measures, such as those announced today, to detain German exports. This may cause inconvenience, or even losses, to various neutral countries, but since the shipping and lives of the people of neutral countries have been severely damaged by Germany's actions, it is also worthwhile to accept the measures of England and France and make some sacrifices in order to protect their own interests. Our goal is to stop German export trade. Within the scope of not relying on the aforementioned goal, we are willing to do our best to reduce the damage that various neutral countries may suffer. The date of implementation of the blockade measures is set for December 4, so that various neutral countries have sufficient time to prepare." He then spoke about the goals of peace, saying, "How to establish the goals of peace and lay the foundations for a better new world order after the end of the war is not something that our country can decide on its own. We must consult with other countries, our allies, and our autonomous territories, and even seek the views of the defeated countries before making a decision. The policies pursued by Germany in recent years have made it impossible to fulfill the mission of improving the world situation. We are convinced that the world situation will not improve unless that country abandons these policies. Therefore, we are at war with Germany for this purpose. However, the extent to which the current war will be prolonged, the direction in which the war will develop, and who our friends and enemies will be when the war is finally decided are all uncertain. It would be not only useless but also harmful to prematurely propose conditions for how to create a new world order. Therefore, today, we can only offer general principles at most. In short, our war has no punitive intent, and we do not intend to force the enemy country to accept a peace treaty of a punitive nature. The urgent task is to eliminate the threats to European countries, but the problems in other parts of the world must also be addressed. I believe that the key to the world situation lies in Europe. As long as European countries restore confidence, all European problems can be solved easily, and the solution to problems in other parts of the world will not be too difficult." At this point, Prime Minister Chamberlain also said, "Major Attlee advocates abandoning all imperialism. If the meaning of imperialism lies in recognizing oneself as superior in terms of race, and in canceling the political and economic freedoms of other countries, and in exploiting the resources of other countries for one's own use, then I dare to proclaim to the world that all of these are not characteristics of our country, but are characteristics of the current German government. As for the League of Nations, it has failed in its mission of maintaining peace, but its efforts in the study of various economic and social problems, and in the promotion of international health and cultural cooperation, are of great value and are also a real situation. Major Attlee also said that wartime is an appropriate time to promote socialism. I must answer that the government is not stubborn in its views. Since 1931, the various social reform plans implemented by the government have been numerous and can be reviewed." (Havas dispatch of the 28th)

### Economic Blockade Against Germany by England and France: Preserving the Interests of Neutral Countries; Germany Decides to Adopt Countermeasures

Berlin: As of last night, Germany had not yet issued an official statement regarding the British blockade measures, but government officials believe that Germany will inevitably take countermeasures to maintain its trade with various neutral countries. However, the nature of these countermeasures is not yet known at this time. (Haitong dispatch of the 29th)

London: After England and France issued orders to blockade German export trade, well-informed sources here recently said that the foreign currency that the country earned from export trade last year was worth 2.2 billion marks, which is necessary for the country to purchase various goods from foreign countries and conduct propaganda campaigns in various neutral countries. What England and France have done now is sufficient to cut off its source of foreign currency, and its nature is extremely important. However, England and France are still willing to pay the greatest attention to the interests of various neutral countries. Various goods in whose manufacturing process German labor or German materials account for less than 25 percent of the total will still be released by the inspection authorities of England and France. This is an example of taking into account the interests of various neutral countries. Official sources say that after England and France take retaliatory measures against Germany, most countries in the world can return to a healthier and freer mode of trade. Even if Germany threatens to do everything it can politically, it will have no commercial interests whatsoever. (Havas dispatch of the 28th)

### French Political and Military Leaders Hold Meetings: Parliament Scheduled to Reopen Today

According to well-informed sources, Prime Minister Daladier will report on the military and diplomatic situation in the Chamber of Deputies at that time, while Cabinet Coordinator Chautemps will deliver a similar report in the Senate.

The Chinese army remained calm and fought back until the morning of the 27th, when the Chinese army safely withdrew. In this battle, more than one hundred and sixty Japanese soldiers were killed.

### A Certain Commander Talks About High Morale at the Front: Excellent Impressions Along the Way; Cooperation Between the Military and Civilians Guarantees Victory in the War of Resistance

Somewhere in Northern Hunan: Commander × personally inspected the front lines of Northern Hunan, Southern Hubei, and Northern Jiangxi, braving the difficult journey and not avoiding wind and rain. Upon hearing the news, all parties showed great respect. When Mr. × returned to a certain place yesterday, the Central News Agency reporter immediately visited him and paid their respects. At that time, Mr. × had just removed the dust of the journey. Although his temples were already gray, his spirit was vigorous, which was a symbol of his hard work. He was pleased to tell me that in this battle of Changsha, our army used × × number of troops to defeat × × ten thousand Japanese troops, crushing their six-pronged attack plan on Changsha. We are deeply concerned about the hard work of our military and civilians on the front lines and the suffering of the people who have been poisoned by the enemy. I personally inspected the front lines of Northern Hunan, Southern Hubei, and Northern Jiangxi last month and instructed the military and civilians on how to kill the enemy and continue to eliminate the remaining enemies. The round trip took nearly a month and covered a distance of 1,600 li. The impressions I saw along the way were excellent. Now that you (referring to the reporter) have comforted me for my hard work, in fact, a long march is more enjoyable than reviewing documents. Now, our frontline soldiers, even after the great victory, have no attitude of pride and complacency. They are ashamed of not having annihilated all the enemies and are competing to attack, and they have frequently made gains. They are more patient, calm, loyal, and courageous than before, and their morale is high. The refugees in the war zone have gradually recovered after successive emergency relief efforts. The people in various places are able to do their best to carry out work such as plowing the fields early to store water, strengthening the conversion of roads into fields, transporting grain up the mountains, organizing and training the people, and dispersing materials. They all share the belief that they will share hardships and lives with the soldiers, and that there will be no gap between the military and civilians, and that victory is certain. If the enemy dares to attempt to invade again, it is no different from throwing themselves into a trap and seeking their own death. The spirit of the military and civilians at the front is uplifting and sufficient to comfort the people of the country. I sincerely hope that all the military and civilians of our country, under the leadership of the heroic and sacred Commander-in-Chief, will unite in arduous struggle, continue to make progress, and hasten the defeat of the enemy and complete the great task of resisting the war and building the country.

Song Meiling Publishes Observations on Northern Hunan

Chongqing: Madam Chiang Kai-shek, Song Meiling, published an article in English today about what she saw in Northern Hunan. It is said that there are quite a few underage children participating in the guerrilla warfare of the Chinese army in Northern Hunan. When Madam Chiang inspected the battlefield hospitals in Hunan Province, she often saw wounded children around the age of ten or twelve. These people all withdrew from the war zone. Orphans who had lost their parents were raised by the soldiers on the front lines and depended on each other. I then ordered the hospital authorities to send these orphans to the Hunan Orphanage after they recovered from their injuries. At that time, one of the wounded children actually said, "I have been a guerrilla for six months. I will go to the front lines again after I recover from my injuries until we win the final victory before I go to school to study." Madam Chiang also said, "The most deplorable thing is that there are very few medical supplies in the battlefield hospitals, but the doctors and nurses are doing their best to work, which is gratifying." Madam Chiang also said that several women from the Women's Association and the Women's Work Team of the New Life Movement in Hunan accompanied her on this trip. (United Press dispatch of the 29th)

### Belgian Consul in Shanghai Returns from Visiting Chongqing: States That China Will Surely Win; Gives Banquet for Belgian Students Studying in China Yesterday to Share His Impressions; Met Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing and Discussed the War of Resistance

Mr. Civile, the Belgian Consul General in Shanghai, visited Chongqing, China's wartime capital, four months ago to observe China's sacred war of resistance and was deeply impressed. Mr. Civile hosted a reception at the Belgian Consulate in Shanghai at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route Pichon at 7 PM last night to promote Sino-Belgian relations and share his impressions of his visit to Chongqing with Chinese students studying in Belgium.

A Grand Gathering

In addition to more than one hundred Chinese students studying in Belgium, including Zhang Chongren, those who participated in the Belgian Consul's banquet last night included the current Chinese Minister to Belgium Zhu Hexiang, former Minister to Belgium Wei Zhudong, and the famous ophthalmologist Lu Runzhi. It was a grand gathering on an unprecedented scale.

Meeting Chairman Chiang

After the guests were seated, Consul General Civile delivered a welcoming speech, sharing his impressions of his visit to Chongqing. He said, "During my visit to Chongqing, I was invited to a banquet by General Chiang Kai-shek, the supreme leader of China. Mr. Chiang was energetic and had a very pleasant conversation with me. Mr. Chiang told me that the current situation of China's war of resistance is similar to the situation that your country encountered during the First European War, and that the final victory is sure to be in our hands. Like your country, we have a firm determination, because China and Belgium are resisting aggression for justice and fairness and promoting the indomitable national spirit, which is regarded as a sacred duty of the people.

Good Impressions

In Chongqing, I also hosted a banquet for Chinese students studying here. During the banquet, Japanese planes attacked and the alarm sounded, but the diligent spirit of the Belgian students studying here to devote themselves to the war of resistance left me with a deep and good impression. What I observed in Chongqing is sufficient to prove that China's war of resistance will surely win the final victory."

Final Victory

After the conclusion of Mr. Civile's speech, Mr. Wei Zhudong, the Chinese Minister to Belgium, delivered a speech, stating that in 1914, Belgium was subjected to a large-scale invasion by Germany. Belgium did not consider its military strength to be weak and disregarded everything, launching a war of resistance and finally winning the final victory, which proves that justice and fairness will surely be upheld. As our country approaches the day of victory, we can use this as a mirror. At around 9 PM, the guests and hosts parted in a harmonious atmosphere.

### Ministry of Finance Did Not Hold Financial Conference: Financial Personnel in this City Did Not Go to Hong Kong

Regarding the news circulating that the financial authorities of the National Government would hold a financial conference in Hong Kong in early December, the reporter learned from the financial community in this city yesterday that this rumor is not true. The Shanghai branches of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China handle business and regulate finance in accordance with the instructions of their head offices at any time. Recently, everything has been normal. According to reliable information from the banking community, it was rumored that important personnel from the four banks and various commercial banks were summoned to Hong Kong to attend the conference. Now that the rumor of the conference has been proven untrue, how can there be a summons to Hong Kong? It is clear that this is purely speculation.

### The Saying That Nanshi is Open is Groundless: Authorities in the French Concession Know Nothing About It

According to Japanese sources the other day, the woven gate between Nanshi and the French Concession in Kunyun will be opened at Nanyang Bridge, Xinzha Gate, and Lao Beimen on December 1 for a five-day trial, and then officially opened from 7 AM to 7 PM every day. The Japanese authorities have also selected 100 Shanghai West puppet police officers to go to Nanshi for appointment. It sounded so definite that the iron ruler at the border between Nanshi, which had been blockaded for a long time, would really be opened. As a result, the houses in the Nanshi refugee area have been active in the past day or two, and many people have gone to that area to look for houses, and they plan to open large gambling dens and opium dens there to become the second bad place on the isolated island. However, according to news received from the French Concession police, the police have not heard the rumor of the opening from the Japanese or puppet authorities. The iron gate in the transport area of Nanshi is managed by the French police. Without the consent of the French Municipal Council, the iron gate will not be opened.

### Japan Indiscriminately Issues Military Scrip: Forcing Common Use in Central China; All Transactions Use Military Scrip; Pretending That It Is Equal in Value to Japanese Currency

Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the National Army withdrew from the southeastern region, and the Japanese army used Japanese bank notes wherever they went. Later, they issued Japanese military scrip without issuing banks. However, the Chinese in various places trusted Chinese legal tender, so although the number of Japanese military scrip was said to be large, most of those in the hands of the Chinese were unwilling to keep them. Recently, the Japanese army authorities decided to use military scrip in Central China after several discussions. The economic and financial significance of this decision has its own purpose. According to Japanese sources yesterday, the regulations for the use of Japanese military scrip are as follows: (1) After December 1, Showa 14, banks shall not disburse Japanese bank notes (except for those traveling to Japan or Manchuria). (2) Since January 1, Showa 15, banks must obtain permission from the Shanghai Finance Officer's Office of the Ministry of Finance (4th floor of the Yokohama Specie Bank, 24 The Bund) to accept Japanese bank notes. (3) Those who currently hold Japanese bank notes must exchange them for military scrip at the bank before December 31, Showa 14. (4) After December 1, Showa 14, all transactions in Central China that have been paid with Japanese bank notes shall be replaced by military scrip. According to the Japanese side, military scrip is the same as Japanese bank notes and can be remitted to Japan or used for the settlement of import exchange. After the implementation of this method, anyone traveling to Central China should exchange their Japanese bank notes for military scrip, or those traveling from Central China to Japan or Manchuria should exchange their military scrip for Japanese bank notes.

### The Puppet Regime Attempts to Forcibly Collect House Rent in Shanghai West: Actually Issued Fake Notices and Set a Deadline for Payment; The Municipal Council is Closely Monitoring the Situation

The Shanghai West Puppet "Unified Tax Bureau," after extracting a portion of the business tax in the Caojiadu area, re-established a "Shanghai West Factory Registration Office," enticing manufacturers to register and attempting to collect exorbitant taxes. However, the manufacturers saw through their tricks and resolutely refused. The puppet regime changed its course and collected house rent. Previously, they sent out puppet "collectors" to distribute notices in the areas of Route Baillie and Route Siccawei, which were built beyond the boundary, but the residents ignored them after receiving them. Yesterday, the residents of Yuyuan Road also received a fake notice, planning to forcibly collect winter house rent starting on December 1, and setting a deadline for full payment within the year. It is said that the Municipal Council is closely monitoring its development.

### US Naval Commander Bids Farewell to Shanghai Residents, Scheduled for Radio Broadcast on Monday, Expected to Leave Shanghai Next Month to Return to the US

The English-language "Too Mei Evening Post" reports that Colonel Fagan, Commander of the US Fourth Marine Regiment, will leave Shanghai early next month to return to the United States. He is scheduled to deliver a farewell speech to the foreign community in Shanghai on Monday via the XMHA radio station.

### Huangpu River Has Not Been Dredged for Two Years, Navigation Prospects Cause Concern, Japanese Side Actually Forbids the Huangpu River Bureau from Working, Some Locations Must Have Silt Accumulation

Yesterday (the 28th), an official from the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau stated that the Huangpu River, with its broad surface, continues to experience congested traffic. Deep-draft vessels and local boats constantly ply the waters. However, dredging work has not been carried out for more than two years, and the riverbed must be in poor condition. It is understood that the river-clearing dredging work was halted in the year of the

Outbreak of the Shanghai War

Afterwards, the local Japanese authorities forbade the Huangpu River Bureau from performing its routine duties of maintaining the waterway and preventing silt accumulation. The dredger "Chen Xi" has been moored in Pudong for nearly thirty months. Recently, the Japanese naval authorities have been discussing methods with the Huangpu River Bureau so that necessary work can be continued without losing authority or wasting precious time. It is widely believed that this matter will soon

Undergo Adjustment. Another official from the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau continued, stating that so far, various ships navigating the Huangpu River have not been reported to have encountered difficulties, including large vessels. However, at present, silt must have accumulated in certain locations, and the Bureau has no way of knowing the depth of the Huangpu River channel.

Large Ocean Liners Enter

When sailing upstream, the ships can, of course, measure the depth themselves, but the results of their measurements are not reported to the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau. It is said that although the Japanese authorities do not allow the Huangpu River to be dredged, they are carrying out work on the Wusong River near the mouth of the Huangpu, planning to build docks and warehouses along the river to make it an important center for Japanese trade in the Yangtze River area. It is also said that the

Qiujiang Wharf

Reconstruction work has already begun, and when completed, it will allow the Japanese-controlled area to seize the waterfront commerce of the Bund. Since the Japanese authorities do not allow dredging of the Huangpu River, while developing their own docks and port facilities, the shipping industry in this city speculates whether their aim is to continue to economically control Shanghai.

### Judges and Lawyers Receiving Threatening Letters Is Unconfirmed, Various Parties Have Not Officially Verified, Strengthening Prevention Is Not a Recent Development

The "Zi Lin Bao" reports that rumors of judges and lawyers of the Chinese and French courts in the Public and French Concessions receiving threatening letters in the past few days could not be officially verified last night (the 28th). It is said that lawyers in the legal department of the Public Works Department have not received threatening letters. When reporters inquired about this matter from reliable sources late last night, they replied that they had not heard anything about the threatening letters. The French Concession Police Department further stated that to the best of their knowledge, no court officials in the French Concession have received threatening letters. As for the strengthening of prevention in the courts and the lawyers' offices of the Public Works Department, it is said that the patrol officers stationed in the various judicial offices have been increased since 1937.

### The False Regime's Tax Collection Resurfaces, Attempt to Seize Land Records Fails, Method Changed to Arbitrary Valuation by Local Chiefs

It is rumored that the false "Bureau of Finance" and the false "Bureau of Land" are currently making every effort to collect false "field taxes" in the suburbs of the city. Their previous attempt to seize land records from the former Municipal Land Administration Bureau failed, so they changed their method and ordered the "Public Offices" in various districts to instruct "village heads" to be responsible for the investigation. The false "Land Review Committee," which was once rumored to have been suspended, is now actively proceeding, using the third floor of the Tianhou Palace City Chamber of Commerce original site as its office, ordering all false "land servants" to register. The third step is to first collect taxes from the suburban counties that have been incorporated into the false "urban area." The collection has already begun in the Pudong, Chuansha, and Nanhui counties within the strongholds controlled by the Japanese army in recent days. Baoshan, Chongming, and Jiading counties have also been designated as false "urban areas" for tax collection. It is already difficult for farmers to maintain their livelihoods after the devastation. In the future, they will face a heavier burden of exploitation. The original urban areas in Pudong, Nanshi, Zhabei, and Huxi will also begin to collect taxes next month. The amount of "field tax" levied has no standard because there are no land records for reference. It is left to the false "village heads" to arbitrarily assess the value for the purpose of forced collection.

### All Leather Industry Workers in the City Demand Pay Raise, Presenting Three Conditions

There are more than 200 leather factories in the city, including Dahua, Sanjiang, Sanmin, Guben, Fuhe, Rongkang, Xinhua, Jinfuji, and Meixiangtai, with a total of approximately 4,000 workers. They produce large items such as Western-style leather suitcases and trunks, as well as small items such as leather briefcases, handbags, and gloves. These products are sold in various parts of Southeast Asia and to major companies in this city. Previously, in order to strengthen the emotional ties among workers and promote mutual benefit between labor and management, Jin Shougen and others initiated the organization of the Shanghai Leather Industry Workers' Friendship Association, and obtained group registration certificate C No. 62 from the Public Concession Police Department. The purpose is not only to connect the friendship of all workers, but also to strive to improve treatment and increase worker welfare. The association, in view of the fact that the treatment in leather factories throughout the city is not uniform, with varying degrees of benefits, and some workers work day and night without any rest throughout the year, while earning only ten or more yuan, which is difficult to maintain in times of high prices and living costs, resolved at the second representative meeting to propose three conditions to the employers to improve treatment, demanding an increase in wages or monthly salaries. This resolution was directly sent by the association to the trade association on the 21st of this month, and sent separately to various factories, requesting a satisfactory reply before the end of this month (November 30th), otherwise, it will be regarded as tacit approval, and will be implemented starting from February 1st. It is reported that some factories have been able to understand the difficulties of the times and sympathize with the plight of the workers, and have expressed their support for the increase in wages.

### Chinese Police Receive Early Pay Raise, Already Decided, Housing Allowance for Police Officers Also Approved for Temporary Increase

The Public Concession Public Works Department recently issued a statement stating that the Bureau has recently decided that all Chinese constables and sergeants in the Police Force, who are employed on the 31st of this month, will be allowed to receive a salary increase one year earlier than their entitlement within the scope permitted by the salary scale. The housing allowance for Chinese police officers from constables to chief inspectors will also be temporarily increased. The total amount added for both items is approximately 20 million national currency per year, of which approximately two-thirds is for the increased housing allowance. The number of constables and sergeants in the Chinese police section included in this year's budget is 3,171 constables and 406 sergeants and acting sergeants.

### British Ship "Seda Na" Sinks, Survivors Arrive in Shanghai, Vividly Recount Circumstances of the Incident, Praising Crew for Heroic and Appropriate Response

The "Continental News" reports that the British mail steamer "Seda Na" struck a mine and sank in Singapore Bay on the 13th of this month, with 24 passengers losing their lives. Fortunately, some surviving passengers were transferred to the "Roas" and arrived in Shanghai on Sunday. Yesterday (the 28th), they told reporters about the heroic efforts of the crew after the "Seda Na" struck a mine, and how they maintained order among the 700 passengers.

Whole Ship Sank After Twenty Minutes

According to Mr. Gelat, a member of the American magic troupe, who witnessed the scene, at around 9:40 a.m. on November 13th, the "Seda Na" sailed out of Singapore. About twenty minutes later, the ship's port side struck a sea mine, causing a deafening explosion. About twenty minutes later, the whole ship sank.

Deafening Sound Struck Everyone

When the explosion occurred, he and other passengers were dancing on deck when they suddenly heard a deafening sound, followed by cries for help from women and children. Everyone panicked and did not know how to escape. At that time, his first thought was for the safety of his wife, so he rushed to another part of the ship to rescue his wife, and went into the cabin to retrieve his camera in order to take pictures.

Photos Taken Were Destroyed by Water

When he returned to the deck with a life jacket, senior crew members were directing the lowering of lifeboats onto the water to help passengers get into the boats, most of whom were women and children. At that time, he took about twenty photos, but because the lifeboats were full, he and another American passenger had to jump into the water, causing most of the photos to be destroyed by water.

A Lifeboat Tragically Sunk

A lifeboat full of women and children suddenly capsized, and everyone in the boat fell into the water. At least two children tragically drowned. After swimming for fifteen minutes with his American friend, he turned around and saw that the "Seda Na" had sunk. He, the captain, and several assistants were the last to leave the ship. There were many Indians from India on board, as well as about 170 Chinese who had been expelled from the Straits Settlements.

Chinese in the Lower Cabins Were Also Rescued

The ship was fully loaded, and the expelled Chinese were confined to the locked lower cabins and guarded by several Indians. After the mine exploded, the Indians hurriedly fled, and the Chinese shouted for help. Subsequently, a senior British crew member used his pistol to shoot the lock and destroy it. The cabin door was opened, and the Chinese were led to the deck to escape in lifeboats. According to Gelat, he and nine other members of the magic troupe were on their way back to the United States and will leave Shanghai for the United States around December 8th.

### Rice Prices Began to Fall Yesterday, Arrivals Are Extremely Plentiful and Large Quantities Are Still Being Shipped to Shanghai, Rice Weevil Rumors Inflating Prices Proved to Be True

The Shanghai rice market as a whole has soared recently, and the price increases cannot be suppressed. The source of national rice has not been interrupted, and six to seven thousand bags are shipped by train every day. Judging from the current daily demand for rice, the arrivals are sufficient to balance the supply and demand. However, the rise in rice prices is obviously caused by rumors fabricated by rice weevils. Yesterday, after the rice firms' tea party market opened at 9 o'clock, the market sentiment turned downward. As a result, japonica and indica rice both fell by about half a yuan. A total of more than 4,000 bags were traded in the morning. Yesterday, two or three boats arrived from the river, and more than 15,000 bags were shipped by train. It is reported that a large quantity of japonica rice will arrive today.

### Principal and Interest Payments for Yu Ping Bonds, Remittance Drafts and Notes, Unified Type W and Telecommunications Bonds to Be Drawn on the Ninth of Next Month, 6% Sterling Gold Bonds to Be Drawn on the First of Next Month

In order to maintain its creditworthiness, the National Government is making efforts to repay the principal and interest on maturing bonds on schedule, which has won the trust of bondholders. The principal and interest on the Wang Ping Bonds are scheduled to be paid starting today. Shanghai will pay Shanghai drafts and notes. Unified Type W, Telecommunications, and Sterling Gold Bonds will be drawn on a regular basis. The details are as follows:

Yu Ping Bonds

The National Government previously issued 12 million yuan of the 23rd Year (of the Republic) Yu Ping Railway Bonds in order to build the Yushan to Pingxiang Railway in Jiangxi Province. The ninth principal and interest payment will be paid by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications starting from the 30th of this month. The Ministry of Salt Affairs has already ordered the West Bank Inspection Office to allocate the principal and interest repayment fund designated by the Central Bank from the Jiangxi local salt tax surcharge and deposit it into the National Price Fund Management Committee account of the Central Bank for payment of principal and interest at maturity. It is reported that the principal repayment is 840,000 yuan. In Shanghai, all remittance drafts and notes will be paid.

Unified Type W and Telecommunications

The National Debt Fund Management Committee has set December 9th as the date for drawing lots to repay the principal of the 25th Year (of the Republic) Unified Public Debt Type W bonds and the 24th Year (of the Republic) Telecommunications Public Debt. (1) Unified Type W bonds issued for 260 million yuan, with the eighth principal repayment of 2.08 million yuan and interest payment of 7.5 million yuan, 3600 yuan this time. Payment will begin at the end of January next year. (2) Telecommunications Public Debt was issued for 1 million yuan. This is the 17th repayment, which will be paid by the Central Bank and its authorized banks at the end of December. The purpose of issuing these public bonds is to reorganize and expand telegraph, telephone, and wireless communications.

Railway Construction

The former Ministry of Railways issued 12 million yuan of the 23rd Year (of the Republic) First Phase Railway Construction Bonds in order to realize its plan to build new railways and renovate old railways, specifically for the use of the Yu Ping Railway. In the 25th year, it issued 27 million yuan of the Second Phase Railway Construction Bonds for the construction of the Nanping section of the Wang Ping Railway. The principal and interest repayments of the First Phase and Second Phase bonds are scheduled to be made every year at the end of June and the end of December, and are handled by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. It is reported that these public bonds are not traded on the market and are underwritten by a syndicate organized by various banks. The current principal and interest repayment is scheduled to begin on December 31st.

Sterling Gold Bonds

The 23rd Year (of the Republic) 6% Sterling Gold Bonds, the 11th drawing for principal repayment, has been set for December 1st at the Shanghai Huabi Bank. The principal repayment is 69,000 pounds. Payment will begin on January 1st next year by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, HSBC, and four other banks. It is reported that the funds are allocated from the British refund of the Boxer Indemnity obtained by the Ministry of Railways and stored for preparation.

### Value-Declared Mail, Temporarily Reducing Limit, Effective Tomorrow

The Shanghai Postal Administration has temporarily changed the maximum value-declared limit for value-declared mail sent abroad, which was originally 3,000 gold francs, and the value-declared limit for boxes was 2,500 gold francs, due to changes in the exchange rate between the gold franc and the national currency. Starting from December 1st, the maximum value limit will be temporarily changed to 1,500 gold francs. In the future, the maximum limit for value-declared mail and boxes sent to various countries, originally set at 3,000 gold francs or 2,500 gold francs, will be temporarily changed to 1,500 gold francs. Those that are less than 1,500 gold francs, or are sent in national currency, will still be handled as before.

### Shanghai Will Promote the Moral Re-Armament Movement Starting Tomorrow, Large-Scale Events Will Be Held for Three Days, Chongqing, Hong Kong, and Beiping Will Be Promoted Simultaneously

The World Moral Re-Armament Movement will be promoted on a large scale on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of next month. Its goal is to enable 100 million people around the world to listen to God in order to obtain a victorious life. During these three days, this city will also hold this movement. In addition to introducing the meaning and latest news of the movement in major Chinese and foreign newspapers, special publications such as "The Masses Monthly" will be issued, and a famous book called "How to Start" will be distributed in the Da Xin Company and the Wuzhou Bookstore, etc. The book uses simple and practical language to describe how to start and achieve a victorious life. In addition, slogans for moral re-armament will be posted in major stores, and slides will be shown in various cinemas to awaken the public's awareness of morality. It is reported that the most important programs of the movement during the three days are radio broadcasting and public lectures. The broadcasting program is from 12:45 to 1:30 p.m. on the Eastern Radio Station (frequency 1220), and from 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. on the Jiangyin Radio Station (frequency 760), divided into six major units: youth, education, career, medicine, family, and church (one unit per day), telling the audience their experiences to answer the audience's questions in life. The people in the movement sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will pay attention to this positive broadcasting and tune in at that time.

### Plain Cars and White Horses in Front of the Funeral Home, Wu Guangxin's Funeral Ceremony, To Be Transported Back to Native Place for Burial When the Situation Stabilizes, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Xiaolin, and Others All Paid Their Respects Yesterday

After the death of General Wu Guangxin, a senior advisor to the Military Council of the National Government, in Hong Kong, his coffin was transported to Shanghai by the Taikoo Company's Jia Ying Ship. It docked at the Taikoo Wharf at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. The Shanghai Funeral Home dispatched a hearse to the wharf at 2:15 p.m. to start the funeral procession. At 3:30 p.m., the coffin was transported to the funeral home for the funeral ceremony. A reporter from Da Zhong She went to the funeral home at 4:00 p.m. yesterday to interview Mr. Lu Shouchu, a close relative of Wu, who recounted the details of Wu's death.

Followed Duan to Leave Tianjin and Go South

In the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, considering the harsh environment in Tianjin and Beiping, telegraphed Duan Zhiquan to move south in order to preserve his reputation. Wu, being a close relative of Lao Zhi through marriage and sharing the same political views, resolutely followed Duan south. The National Government appointed Wu as a member of the Military Council. When residing in Shanghai, he enjoyed poetry and wine with Duan, and spent his leisure time playing chess. After Duan's death, he was able to resist external inducements and was never corrupted by evil forces. His noble character was praised by people.

Devoted to Military Planning and Exhausted

One month after the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, Wu traveled between Hankou and Chongqing, devoting himself to military planning and becoming deeply exhausted. After the fall of Wuhan, Wu transferred from Chongqing to Hong Kong, residing in a secluded house, sometimes traveling between Hong Kong and Chongqing, in preparation for inquiries from the central government. At this time, the Military Council had been established, and Wu took the post of senior advisor. However, he spent most of his time residing in Hong Kong.

Died Suddenly in Hong Kong, Coffin Transported to Shanghai

Wu had a stomach ailment, which flared up from time to time. On the 3rd of this month, he contracted the flu and immediately sought medical treatment. His condition improved on the 9th, but it worsened again on the 14th. He suddenly passed away at 8:20 a.m. on the 15th. Upon hearing the news, key figures in the central government, such as Chairman Chiang and Secretary General Zhang Yuejun, telegraphed their condolences to his family in Hong Kong. Wu's family, considering the inconveniences of keeping the coffin in Hong Kong, decided to transport the coffin to Shanghai. On the 24th, the Taikoo Company's Jia Ying Ship sailed from Hong Kong with the coffin, arriving in Shanghai on the 28th.

Life's Glory and Death's Sorrow, Relatives and Friends Pay Their Respects

Wu's coffin is temporarily placed in the Shanghai Funeral Home. Once the situation stabilizes, it will be transported back to Wu County, his native place, for burial. No ceremonies or condolences will be held in Shanghai. It is rumored that Wu's relatives and friends plan to initiate a memorial meeting, but no concrete decision has been made yet. Yesterday, a simple funeral ceremony was held at the funeral home. Mr. Zhang Xiaolin donated the services of many monks and Taoists to chant scriptures in front of the coffin. Those who paid their respects included Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Xiaolin, Wu Yunzhai, Shen Yongsan, and more than 100 relatives and friends of Wu during his lifetime. Wu is survived by three sons, Bi Chang, Bi Fa, and Bi Kang, who are all studying, and three daughters.

### Sunday School Promotion Association Requests Assistance from All Sectors

The City Sunday School Promotion Association has been established for 20 years. The purpose of the association is to widely establish Sunday schools, cultivate children's noble character, and be the pioneer of moral movement. When the first school was established, there were 70 students and 14 volunteer teachers. At present, the number of schools has increased to 26, with more than 150 volunteer teachers. Despite the impact of the two wars of January 28th and August 13th, the school has continued to work hard and move forward. However, the working area has expanded, and the subsequent expenses have also increased accordingly. Over the years, the association has received the grace of the Lord and the enthusiastic support of all sectors, which has enabled the association's affairs to proceed smoothly. However, since the start of fundraising for the current session, although 1,529.00 yuan has been obtained, it is still far from the goal. Therefore, we have to make an appeal, hoping that all sectors will continue to donate generously to achieve the goal.

### Huangpu River Water Level Drops Sharply

The water level of the Huangpu River has dropped sharply in recent days, especially in the area around the 16th Pier. The water level is extremely shallow during low tide, and it is already difficult for deep-draft vessels to call at the port. Even more serious, in the Wusong River (i.e., Suzhou Creek) from the Lao Zha Bridge to the Xin Zha Bridge section, the riverbeds on both sides are exposed very high during low tide. Therefore, inland river vessels can only navigate in the middle of the river channel, and there is a risk of running aground if they are not careful. The above phenomena are all caused by the impact of the suspension of dredging projects.

### Panic About Auxiliary Currency Notes Has Gradually Been Eliminated, More Than 1.5 Million Yuan Has Been Exchanged in Recent Days, Discounted Exchange Is Not Allowed by National Laws

After the panic over the shortage of auxiliary currency notes in Shanghai, the four banks of Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture have negotiated a remedy, issuing the new and old auxiliary currency notes in their reserves to facilitate circulation and relieve the market. The 25-cent notes of the Central Bank and the auxiliary currencies of the Zhejiang Local Farmers Bank and the Jiangsu Farmers Bank of the Chinese Farmers Bank have been exchanged as much as possible. Those who apply for exchange at various banks have been crowded in recent days. It is reported that the total amount exchanged by various banks is more than 1.5 million yuan in national currency. The panic over auxiliary currency notes has gradually been eliminated. However, some small money shops, which specialize in buying and selling auxiliary currency notes, ignore government laws and arbitrarily conduct improper discounted trading. In Shanghai, where the government's power is temporarily limited, it is hoped that all small money shops should be aware of the situation and not hoard auxiliary currencies for profit in the future, so as to avoid disrupting the entire financial situation in Shanghai. The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank posted the "Temporary Measures for Exchanging Fractional Notes" yesterday: (1) Exchanges are limited to 50-cent notes; (2) Each person is limited to 100 yuan; (3) The exchange will be stopped when the reserves are exhausted. At the same time, the exchange was officially started, and the congestion was unusually high, but the order was relatively good. The bank closed the iron gate and stopped the exchange at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. It is reported that the exchange will continue today and tomorrow.

### Staff Member of a Bank in Tianjin Flees with 40,000 US Dollars, Accompanied by a Prostitute, Comes to Shanghai by Ship from Tianjin, Shanghai Bank Reports to Police to Wait and Arrest, Person and Stolen Goods Apprehended on the Hubei Ship

A major bank in this city recently received a telegram from its Tianjin branch stating that a staff member of the branch had escaped with 40,000 US dollars in tickets and had come to Shanghai on the Taikoo Company's Hubei Ship. After receiving the telegram, the bank notified the French Concession Police and requested their arrest. After receiving the report, the police dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to guard the No. 3 Wharf of the Taikoo Company. Yesterday, the ship arrived in Shanghai and berthed at the No. 3 Wharf at 12:00 noon. The detectives boarded the ship to search and apprehended the staff member and a young woman in a certain room and opened the staff member's suitcase to search. 35,000 US dollars in tickets were found. The staff member and the young woman were quickly taken to the police station along with the US dollars in tickets, pending interrogation by the court. It is reported that the young woman is a famous prostitute in Tianjin, and the 5,000 US dollars that have been used were reportedly used to redeem the prostitute from her contract. Now that they have both escaped, they originally hoped to live a carefree life, but unexpectedly, before they reached the shore, they were both imprisoned.

### Dingyuan Money Shop Robbery Case, Driver Conspires with Thieves, Both Criminals Sentenced to Imprisonment

Zhang Yiding, the owner of the Dingyuan Money Shop at 243 Hankou Road and 287 Penglu Road, carried 8,000 Japanese yen from the Penglu Road Dingyuan at 8:30 a.m. on the 14th of the month and took a private chartered car driven by driver Guo Zixiang to the Hankou Road Dingyuan. When the car passed the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Hong Kong Road, it was suddenly robbed of all the money by two robbers. One of the robbers, Huang Liancai, who was holding a pistol, was arrested by Chief Inspector Yang Zhaoqing of the General Police Department at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Beijing Road. A pistol and four bullets were confiscated. The original driver, Guo Zixiang, was also suspected of colluding and was detained together. They were sent to the Special No. 1 Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Criminal Judge Qian Hongye opened the court to continue the trial. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that Guo had confessed to conspiring with the robbers in advance and agreed on a place to divide the loot after the incident. Therefore, he was prosecuted together. After questioning by Judge Qian, Huang Liancai was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, and Dun Zixiang was sentenced to three years and six months' imprisonment as a warning. The pistol and bullets were confiscated.

### Purchasing Dyeing Fabric Pigments, Payment Was Robbed, Criminal Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment

At 2:55 p.m. on the 21st of this month, the Gongsheng Woolen Mill in Room 312 of the Guohua Building at 312 Beijing Road ordered apprentice Han Yongyuan to take 3,977 yuan in legal tender to the Yuanyin Pigment Store (formerly the Japanese Dongguang Factory) in the East Asia Building on Jiujiang Road to purchase dyeing fabric pigments. When Han arrived at the location and was waiting for the elevator, two robbers suddenly each held a pistol and robbed Han of the money he was carrying. Han reported to the nearby police, and the Central Police Department was telegraphed. Detective Yang Peisheng and Detective Yan Hong rushed to the scene to pursue the robbers separately. As a result, robber Chen Qunhe was found in House No. 69 Jiujiang Road, and a pistol was confiscated. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed a lawsuit with the Special No. 1 Court in accordance with the law. Yesterday morning, Criminal Judge Qian Hongye opened the court to continue the trial. Chen confessed to the robbery, but claimed that he was young and ignorant, and was deceived by others, requesting leniency. Judge Qian then sentenced Chen to five years' imprisonment and deprived him of his civil rights for five years. The pistol was confiscated.

### Youth's Hot Love Affair with a Mistress - Wife Reports Adultery to Police - Defendant Admits to Adultery and Cohabitation - Father and Son Sever Ties

Wang Yilin, a Ningbo native residing at 149 Chongqing Road, is 22 years old and works at Xiangxing Foreign Firm. After marrying Zhang Meiqing, a fellow townsman, in January of last year, they were like water and oil, never consummating the marriage. Instead, he became involved and cohabitated with Zhang Chuangying, a Shaoxing woman (26 years old this year), and they already have a daughter. His father, Wang Xianzhang, tried to persuade him to break off the relationship with Zhang, but it was ineffective, leading to the father and son severing ties and publishing a declaration in the newspaper. Now, Wang's wife, Zhang Meiqing, learned that her husband was cohabitating with Zhang at 12, Lane 142, Zhao Zhujiao Road, so she recently

### Finance: China Bank Sells Off Forward U.S. Dollars; Electricity Company's Settlement Is Large, Resulting in U.S. Dollar Flat and British Pound Slightly Easier

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw HSBC posting rates with no change. The off-market for British and U.S. dollars had turned into a hovering state, with narrow fluctuations, generally easier first, then tighter, and then returning to flat. As a result, the British pound was slightly firmer, while the U.S. dollar was unchanged. Although the electricity company and importers, along with Japanese banks, were settling accounts in the middle, Hong Kong and Indian exporters were offering to sell. China Bank also sold off December contracts, resulting in a balance of supply and demand. The process of the day saw a flat opening in the morning, followed by mutual selling by Hong Kong Electric and China Bank, and then selling by Indian exporters and Chinese merchants, which led to a hardening of the market. However, at that time, those willing to take the offer were still good. The British pound once reached 4 shillings, 8 and 4375 pence, and the U.S. dollar also reached 7 yuan, 90625 cents. Subsequently, the electricity company settled a huge amount of British pounds, reaching 50,000 pounds, and importers and Japanese banks also followed suit, so the situation once turned tight, fully realizing tight prices of 4 shillings, 7 and 8125 pence, and 7 yuan, 8125 cents. By noon, the selling trend of Hong Kong Electric and China Bank resurged, and as there were fewer buyers at that time, the market returned to flat. As a result, the closing price was 4 shillings, 8 and 28125 pence, and 7 yuan, 84375 cents, equivalent to a British-U.S. exchange rate of 3 yuan, 8 jiao, and 9 and 9/10 cents. As for futures trading, it was quite active due to the end of the month, but the trend was no different from the spot market.

Hong Kong Also Had Selling

In the early morning, London's major deals, both near and far, shrank by 125. New York's silver price remained flat, and London's raw gold was fixed. The exchange rates for British pound against U.S. dollar, Shanghai dollar, and French franc were all flat. The U.S. dollar shrank by 25 against the British pound, increased by 5 cents against the Shanghai dollar, and increased by 125 against the French franc. The central bank's posted rates for each exchange rate remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning: British pound at 4 shillings, 8 and 125 pence, and U.S. dollar at 7 yuan, 84375 cents, which were no different from the previous day. After opening, Hong Kong Electric and China Bank came to sell spot U.S. dollars at 7 yuan, 875 and 90625 cents to foreign banks. Then, Hong Kong Electric and Indian exporters mutually sold spot British pounds at 4 shillings, 8 and 4375 pence to foreign banks such as the Union Bank. At the same time, the Overseas Chinese Bank also sold December U.S. dollars to Chase Union Bank at 7 yuan, 8125 cents, so the process was slightly firmer. HSBC's posted rates were announced unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was announced down by a small amount. Later, a certain bank absorbed this month's U.S. dollars from Chinese merchants at 7 yuan, 875 cents. Afterward, the electricity company, Japanese banks, and importers also entered the market to buy, so the situation turned softer. It is estimated that the electricity company bought 50,000 pounds of spot British pounds from foreign banks such as Maijiaili and Huabi, at 4 shillings, 8 and 125 pence, and 7 and 8125 pence. Subsequently, importers bought spot U.S. dollars from Chase and a certain bank at 7 yuan, 875 and 8125 cents. At that time, Japanese banks also settled December U.S. dollars with foreign banks at 7 yuan, 78125 and 71875 cents. Subsequently, as there were fewer buyers, and soon Hong Kong Electric and China Bank resumed selling, the situation immediately returned to flat. It is estimated that Hong Kong Electric sold spot British pounds to foreign bank Huabi at 4 shillings, 8 and 4375 pence. Later, China Bank also sold December U.S. dollars to American Bank at 7 yuan, 7 British pounds, 4 shillings, 8 and 28125 pence, U.S. dollars, 7 yuan, 84375 cents, December British pounds, 4 shillings, 7 and 65625 pence, U.S. dollars, 7 yuan, 71875 cents. As a result, compared to the day before yesterday, spot and forward British pounds were slightly easier by 0.015625, while the U.S. dollar was unchanged. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Is Stable

Hong Kong, 29th Dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning, with no changes in exchange rates from various places. At 11:10 AM, the spot Shanghai dollar rose by one yuan, to 308 yuan. At 11:30 AM, it was stable. The spot Shanghai dollar fell back by two yuan, to 306 yuan.

Tianjin, 29th Dispatch: The exchange market opened firmer this morning. The spot British pound increased by 125, to 4 pence and 1875. The spot U.S. dollar eased by 25, to 6 yuan and 875. The Shanghai dollar decreased slightly by half a yuan, to 115 yuan. The "United Notes" in the off-market continued to depreciate by one yuan, to 90 yuan.

### Retail Investors Occasionally Emerge, Gold Market Has No Vitality

Yesterday's spot and off-market situation for cash gold re-entered a state of fatigue. Although Hong Kong buyers bought as many as five or six hundred taels in the middle, there were quite crowded sellers, so the price fell. The opening was immediately suppressed, with as much as 20 yuan, to 3,850 yuan. Soon after, the exchange market reported hardening, and the selling by silver shops and retail investors continued to fall to a low of 3,835 yuan. Subsequently, as the exchange market suddenly softened, a certain money exchange business urgently pulled in on behalf of Hong Kong buyers, sharply raising the price to a peak of 3,875 yuan. However, a certain gold company was determined to sell, and the price slowly went down. Fortunately, the silver shop gang continued to collect on behalf of Hong Kong buyers, still at 3,870 yuan. Then, a certain bull took profits and entrusted a certain silver shop to sell, and at the same time, the foreign exchange returned to flat, and the price once again fell to 3,855 yuan. At noon, a certain gold company took advantage of the low price to cover their short positions, and the noon closing was 3,860 yuan. In the afternoon, gold companies were still full of intention to buy, and the price was good to 3,870 yuan. After entering, although the securities gang and money exchange businesses offered low prices, the price remained flat due to the strong buying by the gold companies, and there was no vitality until the evening closing. The closing price was 3,866 yuan, a slight decrease of 4 yuan compared to the day before yesterday. Trading was still active, at 1,800 to 1,900 taels. Silver shop jewelry was immobile all day, and customs duties, etc., remained flat.

Cash Gold Only Down by a Small Amount of Four Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels), the opening was initially scattered and weak due to the exchange market being firm. Although a certain money exchange business still wanted to pull up the price, retail investors were cautiously watching, and a certain gold company was eager to sell, so the fatigued trend was difficult to reverse. Extending to the 9:25 AM opening, the price was immediately suppressed by 20 yuan. A certain gold company sold 20 taels to the money exchange business, for 3,850 yuan. Shortly after, the price rebounded by five yuan, and the money exchange business then bought 30 taels from the securities gang, for 3,855 yuan. Later, the silver shop gang also began to sell, and the market became even more unsustainable as profits were taken. The price fell by another 20 yuan, and the money exchange business sold ten taels to the gold company, for 3,835 yuan. At that time, the money exchange business cheaply bought in, and the situation had slightly stabilized. Soon after, the exchange market suddenly reported softening, which immediately aroused a buying trend. A certain money exchange business also came to compete to buy on behalf of Hong Kong buyers, and the market image was even stronger, rising by 40 yuan. The money exchange business bought 30 taels from the securities gang, for 3,875 yuan. After the buying trend gradually subsided, gold companies and money exchange businesses mutually sold at high prices. Before long, the price was suppressed again to 3,851 yuan. Subsequently, as gold companies resumed buying in to take profits, the price returned to 3,860 yuan. At that time, a certain silver shop gang suddenly strongly absorbed about 200 taels on behalf of Hong Kong buyers, and continued to pull up the price by ten yuan, to 3,870 yuan. All of these were supplied by gold companies and a certain silver shop, etc. After this, Hong Kong buyers stopped buying, and a certain silver shop continued to sell on behalf of floating investors, dropping the price by 15 yuan. The money exchange business sold 20 taels to the gold company, for 3,855 yuan. Later, a certain gold company took advantage of the cheap price to buy in, pulling up the price by five yuan. A certain gold company bought ten taels from the silver shop gang, for 3,860 yuan, making it the noon closing price. It was heard that after the closing, a certain gold company bought up to 3,865 yuan. In the afternoon, a certain gold company continued to pull up the price, and the money exchange business also had an appetite, and the opening price immediately rose by ten yuan. The money exchange business bought ten taels from the securities gang, for 3,870 yuan. Later, the securities gang and money exchange businesses sold, and the price fell back by ten yuan. The money exchange business sold 20 taels to the silver shop gang, for 3,860 yuan. After entering, a certain gold company resumed buying in, and then pulled up the price by eight yuan. A certain gold company bought 30 taels from the securities gang, for 3,868 yuan. Around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the silver shop gang sold 30 taels to the gold company, for 3,806 yuan, making it the evening closing price. As a result, the final price was down by four yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 40 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the current cash gold of gold companies is 10 yuan higher than spot gold, and the purchase price is reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current bid gold is 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are few transactions.

Jewelry Immobile All Day

The exchange price of jewelry from silver shops did not change all day. Datong Company still suspended the price at 390 yuan. The New Datong Company had the same price, with the purchase price reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Stable

Yesterday, the supply and demand for foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, turned scarce, and the market was stable. The supply of British gold notes was relatively smooth, and the market was slightly easier. The demand for U.S. gold notes was still strong, and the market price was firm. The fluctuations throughout the day were quite narrow, and the evening price was still 12 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2 fen. The demand for Hong Kong notes was quite strong, and the market price was firm. French franc notes were slightly scarce, and the market price fell back. Canadian notes were stagnant, and the Japanese gold note price in the evening was 1 yuan, 1 jiao, 4 fen, and 8 li. Korean notes were also fatigued, and the evening price was 1 yuan, 1 jiao, 3 fen, and 3 li. Yesterday's market prices: British gold notes down by 2 jiao, U.S. gold notes up by 2 fen, Hong Kong notes up by 2 fen, French franc notes down by 8 li, Canadian notes down by 1 jiao, and other currencies were unchanged.

### Securities: Bond Market Silent, Waiting for Rain

Yesterday's off-market for securities remained sluggish and lifeless. The bulls and bears have been stubbornly holding on for a long time, presenting an image of "ten thousand trees are silent, waiting for rain." A slightly larger change in the environment will inevitably bring unexpected events such as "wind and rain suddenly revealing the roof and breaking the tiles." Recently, the rumor of Song's return to lead finance has been used by the bulls, but this has now disappeared. The bulls are still misinterpreting the facts, deceiving themselves and disturbing others. Yesterday morning, initially, because a certain account did long on behalf of customers, the crowd captured the wind and shadows, and the price was slightly higher by one or two jiao. However, the bears were not moved, and the trend still tended to be fatigued in the afternoon. In short, the bulls and bears are evenly matched, and holding on for a long time will be a loss for the bulls. If a new environmental stimulus attacks, it will surely be a temporary sensation. Let us say this to see what our prediction will be. It is estimated that stocks with absolutely no price fluctuations accounted for two out of five, and the rest had a difference of only five cents. The number of transactions was around 400,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Stock trading: 30 shares of China Bookstore were traded, priced at 28 yuan each.

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Industry Association continued to be quiet. The opening price of many stocks once rose, but due to those taking profits, the price fell back slightly. However, the rebound was not strong, and the closing price trended towards firmness again. The number of transactions for International Trust Company, Yangtze Silver Company, Ruirong, China Reclamation and Ewo Cotton Mill stocks was considerable. Rubber stocks slightly softened due to the falling price of raw rubber abroad.

London, 28th Dispatch: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt yesterday and today were stable, and there were no price fluctuations for bonds in the upper and lower ranges.

London, 28th Dispatch: The listed prices of British Far East companies' stocks were generally stable yesterday and today. There were no gains or losses for each stock yesterday (27th). Today (28th), only the Kulaklin Rubber stock sharply increased by one shilling and three pence, with a price of 20 shillings and seven pence. The rest were flat.

### Grain: Manipulation of Rice and Grain, Food Bandit Reports Are Distant, Foreign Rice Pours In, Costs Are Still Light, Speculators Are Already Trying to Escape

Yesterday, various types of rice and grain, River rice disappeared again. Those transported to the port by car included more than ten cars from the Su Tong gang, and more than ten cars of goods from Kunshan, Taicang, and Fenghua. Yesterday, the opening was mediocre, but the general market has constant drastic changes, and general retailers are wary. Local shops rarely inquired, and although the merchants once raised prices, they failed to get their wish due to poor sales. Moreover, speculators and hoarders saw that the market was losing momentum, and manipulating again felt tasteless. In addition, the price has reached its peak, with thin profits and heavy capital, making it feel thorny. Instead, they are selling off the profitable goods one after another, and the market is gradually softening. Later, the large volume of foreign rice in the hands of merchants saw that the situation was not good, and continued to dump and sell at reduced prices. For a time, people became more afraid, trying to sell. At the closing, except for sharp glutinous rice, which was rare and had a small loss compared to other sharp glutinous rice, the remaining non-glutinous rice and foreign rice had fallen by half a yuan compared to the previous market. In total, the entire market traded no more than six or seven thousand bags.

The Ke Xian rice has been continuously impacted by the influx of foreign rice, and the hoarding and speculation by merchants seems to have lost its foundation. In addition to the large quantities of foreign rice arriving at the port the day before yesterday, it is said that another 20,000 bags have arrived and are waiting to be unloaded. That is, the direct orders placed with Saigon a few days ago, some of which are being loaded, can also arrive at the beginning of the month. Moreover, retail Ke Xian goods also continue to arrive in Shanghai. Therefore, retailers are refraining from buying, and hoarders are not dare to advance. Yesterday, fewer than 3,000 bags were traded, and the price had fallen by half a yuan. The price of high-quality Ke Xian rice is around 34 yuan.

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Hong Kong, and in addition to the more than 20,000 bags being unloaded, there is also a ship waiting to be unloaded in Pu. It is said that orders that were placed earlier will arrive in Shanghai after a week, and foreign merchants' asking prices have already been lowered yesterday. Although they may not be close at the moment, people's hearts have been shaken. In addition, the cost of goods coming from Hong Kong is only about 7 Hong Kong dollars, and even with various fees, it is still less than 30 yuan. The sellers are quite willing to sell off as the market goes, so the prices of Annam and Saigon rice have fallen by five or six jiao yesterday.

### Flour Mill Price Up Another Jiao

The current price of flour mills is 7 yuan and 6 jiao, up another jiao. It is found that the local retail market is uniformly enthusiastic, and retail sales from both northern and southern gangs are active. Retail transactions on this street have also increased. Amid the high price of goods and the rising price of raw materials, people's hearts are not upwards. The Pao Chong brand's retail price has been raised by another jiao, and the selling price for December has reached 7 yuan and 8 jiao. The selling price of return flour is brisk, and the price of ground flour has increased by one or two jiao. It is heard that miscellaneous brand flour in the interior has also risen to over 7 yuan. The total market transaction was 50,000 to 60,000 bags.

The source of wheat, due to the expensive price in various producing areas, fewer goods are arriving, and the bottom line of the Shanghai market is also less than 200,000 bags. This batch of goods will be used until the New Year, and it has been locked up by the sellers, who are unwilling to supply it. However, the intake of each factory is very large, so the market is rising higher and higher. The Zhongjue wheat has reached a price of 11 yuan and 8 jiao and a half, and the higher-priced goods have all stood at the 12 yuan mark. Although it has not exceeded, it has risen informally. As a result, due to the persistence of the sellers, only four or five thousand bags were traded in the factory.

### Two British Companies Pay Dividends

The Rubber and Oak Company, a British firm, decided at yesterday's board meeting to pay the second interim dividend for 1939, at 5 jiao per share in national currency, on December 15th. Including the first dividend of 5 jiao in national currency, 1 yuan in national currency has been paid this year.

The Shanghai Xingli Reclamation Company (i.e., China Reclamation Company), a British firm, decided at yesterday's board meeting to pay the second interim dividend for 1939, at 3 jiao per share in national currency, on December 20th. Including the first dividend of 3 jiao in national currency, 6 jiao in national currency has been paid this year.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Turns Fatigued

The yarn market has returned to a fatigued path, but the mindset of the industry is still not weak. There are many who are optimistic because raw cotton prices are high, and factories are gradually approaching costs, with no profit to be made. Therefore, there are quite a few people who are dragging in group reserves to wait for a good price when the price falls. However, some are adjusting to the war in Guangxi, and transportation on all routes is difficult. The demand for 20-count fine yarn from the South China region is still as rare as the morning stars. However, the trade of coarse yarn is still uninterrupted, and people's hearts are mixed.

The opening price of current yarn this morning was slightly up in the eyes of the industry because overseas Indian and American cotton markets have risen, so the opening price was still flat. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 673 yuan, not much different from the previous day. Then, it was heard that the exchange market was slightly softer, and at the same time, Hong Kong buyers' appetites were not strong, and the market's momentum suddenly weakened. Buyers dodged and hid, and the calls for selling were loud. The market price slowly fell, until 660 yuan. Prices of cheaper goods have risen again, rebounding by three or four yuan. It is found that the statistics of transactions in half a day totaled 1,692 bags. The prices of 20-count Double Horse fell by 10 yuan, Heavenly Girl fell by 15 yuan, and Double Globe fell by 11 and a half yuan. Today, 84 pieces of yarn are transported to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed separately as follows: Industry One, 180 Mainland Three, 2 Hong Kong Two, 240 Yunnan Eight, 160 Sichuan. Total 1,692.

### Cotton Also Has Hoarding, Market Prices Consequently Unusually Strong

Spot cotton trading continues to develop in the Qingdao area, with continuous searches for fine yarn raw materials. Business among peers is increasingly prosperous day by day. A portion of wealthy individuals who have historically hoarded cotton yarn are now paying close attention to the war situation in Guangxi. Their intentions are shifting, and they are changing to hoarding cotton, as they believe it will be more profitable. Coupled with the firmness and rise of cotton markets in India and America, their resolve is growing stronger. Therefore, although factories have no intention of purchasing, there are quite a few speculators buying, packing, and stocking up. Consequently, the cotton market situation is uniquely strong, with prices only rising and never falling. Fortunately, fine-staple American cotton is priced about twenty yuan per dan lower than Indian cotton, so people are not too alarmed. In short, in this chaotic situation, various tricks emerge, making it difficult to grasp the situation. The supply from Subei is also seeing smooth flow, with a total of 5,238 bales of Changyinsha Tong cotton arriving at the docks, plus 1,360 bales from Beisha. The spot cotton transaction situation is listed below:

Dafeng American Upland 176.00, Xinyujin 340 pieces

White bale "Fire Machine" 143.00, Peer purchase 151 bales

Tongzhou Cotton 149.00, Also 200 bales

Single Bale "Fire Machine" 143.00, Peer purchase 300 bales

Changyinsha 146.50, Also 82 bales

Tongzhou Cotton 148.00, Also 152 bales

Additional News: Overseas cotton market prices, the New York cotton market, at the opening, showed a state of weakness with underlying firmness. Telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai reported good conditions. Later, due to numerous spot transactions, spot merchants were extremely active in purchasing, and overseas cotton merchants were also very active in buying in the market. As a result, the closing price rose more than ten pounds sterling compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose eight rupees (received a telegram from India stating that the opening price rose another seven rupees). Egypt slightly fell more than twenty pounds sterling. Liverpool rose more than ten pence.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading has become sluggish again in recent days. All parties are deeply afraid of the unpredictable changes in exchange rates, so they generally adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The Japanese side is also quiet. The American cotton ordered by various factories a few days ago will arrive in port successively at the beginning of the month. The factory price converted at the American exchange rate of 7.875 yuan yesterday is listed below:

20 count, American Middling 182.05

Also, Also, Lower grade 175.25

32 count, Also 188.80

Also, Also, Lower grade 180.35

42 count, Also 192.20

Also, Also, Lower grade 182.05

### Miscellaneous Grains - Buying Hats and Other Large Quantities - Sesame and Soybeans Advance

Yesterday, the sesame market price rose because hoarders exhausted their efforts to gather miscellaneous goods. Regardless of whether it was Zhongjue or other sesame varieties, they all rose by about one yuan. The remaining stock amounted to more than ten thousand bags. Foreign firms' actual sales have not been inquired about since they opened at 39.50 yuan. Recent transactions are entirely driven by speculation, with a "buying hat and other large quantities" mentality. Yesterday's total transactions included 500 bags of Yangzhou sesame (price details in the market price column), over 100 bags of Bengbu Jue sesame, over 400 bags of Mingguang sesame, 400-500 bags of Wuhu sesame, 200 bags of Suqian sesame, 30 bags of Guandian sesame, and 27 bags of Jiujiang black sesame, priced at 26.80 yuan, handled by this street. Soybean prices rose by 1.50 yuan due to the continued rise in soybean oil prices, so people's hearts became more eager. Various handlers are eager, and the market price tightened again by 40-50 cents. The overall market opened with 600 bags of Anqing soybeans, priced at 15 yuan; over 500 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans, priced from 15.50 to 36 yuan; over 400 bags of Wuhu soybeans, priced at 15.10 to 15.50 yuan; two cartloads of Nanjing soybeans, priced at 15.20 yuan; two cartloads of Bengbu soybeans, priced at 15.80 yuan; one cartload of Huaiqiu soybeans, priced at 14.50 yuan; and over 300 bags of Chongmingsha soybeans, priced at 16 to 15.40 yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### Scarcity Makes Things Valuable

— Mo Xie

Ordinarily, when we hear people say that scarcity makes things valuable, we tend to be skeptical. But now, rice and firewood are said to be scarce and therefore expensive, reaching the price of pearls and cassia. We cannot help but believe it.

In fact, our skepticism is in vain. We don't need to wait until now, when rice and firewood are seemingly scarce and expensive, to suddenly realize that this statement is indeed a profound truth. Many things have long told us that this saying is indeed a golden rule. Old-fashioned poison, arsenic, and new-fashioned poisons like opium, morphine, heroin, and cocaine, aren't they more expensive than rice simply because they are scarcer? In the countryside, isn't fertilizer more expensive than soil because it's scarcer?

If things are like this, how can people be different? Not long ago, there were so-called "romantic thieves," who were rare among people. As a result, all the major and minor newspapers described them in exhaustive detail, and in the courtroom, there was no standing room for onlookers, who all wanted to see what they were like. Thus, the "romantic thief" became valuable, truly like rising step by step to high places. Recently, another case of incest has emerged, also rare among people. As a result, all the major and minor newspapers have recorded its progress in detail, fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, of course, and the street gossip is rampant and has not stopped yet. It seems that law and human feelings are still at their discretion, but the interest lies in having to take a look. Thus, the Zhou brothers become valuable. A great man cannot leave a fragrant name for a hundred generations, but he should leave a stinking legacy for ten thousand years, truly making people feel like, "One should have a son like Sun Zhongmou."

Other old and cunning schemers and major evildoers can simply be said to be dragons and phoenixes among people (judging from the dragons and phoenixes depicted, their appearance is strange, just about the same as cunning and evil). They are not many, so they should also be regarded as valuable.

In addition, within the so-called human scope, there are certainly other rare species that meet the qualifications of being valuable, such as the old guard and the young remnants.

The so-called old guard and young remnants are actually the same, but with some differences in age. They only know the ancient sage kings that few people know, and do not know the contemporary worthies known to all; they only understand the three bonds and five constant virtues, and do not understand democracy and republic; they only know how to follow the ancient ways, and do not know how to keep up with the times (naturally, they do not know how to run ahead of the times); they only read the archaic language, and never look at modern vernacular;… Therefore, they are extremely rare Shang and Zhou tripods, antiques, and antiques are naturally valuable. Valuable antiques should be stored with great care, or displayed in museums, so if the old guard and young remnants are not dressed up as mummies and buried in pyramids, they should at least be dressed in ancient clothes and hats and seated in the ancestral hall. And the young remnants, at a young age, have such skills, which is especially rare and should be included in the two wings of the Dacheng Hall, alongside Yan Yuan, who did not live to be old, to be paired with and enjoy offerings with Confucius.

However, Zhang Shizhai said, "If everyone in the world were sages, Confucius and Mencius would not be respected," and once "everyone in the world were thieves, Zhi Qiao would not be respected," or "if everyone in the world were the old guard and young remnants, Kang (Youwei) × (no need to drag anyone in) would not be respected," then what would happen? I am truly a little worried for them.

Some people say that there is no such thing in the world, where everyone is the same. The few will always be few, so the valuable will always be valuable. Others say that if the world were really like this, they would be uniquely blessed and understand the great principle that a king must emerge every five hundred years, and naturally embark on another path of scarcity to achieve their value. This is just like when opium becomes too much and is no longer valuable, scarce morphine and the like will emerge to maintain their valuable status.

Alas, scarcity makes things valuable! Those who want to be valuable today, please pay close attention to the way of scarcity!

### Old Wang – A Record of Picking Up Ashes –

— Tang Wei

Old Wang is a burly friend who used to be a staff officer for General Wan Fulin. A diviner once cast his eight characters and determined that he would do something amazing around the age of forty.

Now, having just passed his thirtieth birthday, he is a recommended-level police officer in "Manchukuo." In another ten years, perhaps the diviner's prediction will come true.

This time, he came back and, taking advantage of the opportunity to tutor his wife in mathematics, fostered a close friendship between us.

He lives very frugally himself, but he is not at all stingy in helping friends. He is able to calmly respond to the environment around him; sometimes he still has some timid, conservative elements; these are the traces that his past from a wealthy son to a staff officer and fear have left on him.

He does not like the fickle laughter and tears of "friends in brothels." Therefore, he does not often come to the "brothel."

I remember it was on what day that the owner of the "brothel" initiated several "self-writing" movements. He had two quatrains that were not strict enough:

The first one:

All day without joy or sorrow,

But with heroic feelings contained in my eyebrows,

Not in the days of singing and dancing,

Nor in the time of weeping bitterly.

The second one:

As docile as an ox, as fierce as a tiger,

Heart like spring, temperament like autumn,

Firm integrity not bent by power,

Tears will float towards falling flowers.

From his poems, we can see that his emotions are strong, but when emotions erupt... he can only shed tears for the flowers.

His wife is a woman suffering from "revolution," and although she has countless naive stories that people can't remember, this still has a very great effect on a timid, conservative husband.

"Save up travel expenses; go to Xinjiang!"

They planned like this; year after year passed; until when they decided to leave, the travel expenses had not yet reached the expected amount.

### Short Language Stories

— Zhu Yu

The Fire-Bringer

Prometheus in Greek mythology is an unforgettable person. He is even closer to people, because Zeus is the god of gods, and he is the god of people. For the love of mankind, he brought the fire to earth, and was willing to suffer Zeus's severe punishment. With fire, human life is bright. But Prometheus also taught humans language, making the human spirit bright as well. Without language, the human spirit is dim. Thank you, benevolent Prometheus, he liberated our spiritual activities.

Fire and language, the symbols of humanity's separation from the animal kingdom.

### The Goddess of Language

Ancient people believed that language was created by God. This is not surprising, they received many graces from language, and the giver of these graces did not show any trace of human creation. They naturally thought that it was created by God, just like God created plants, trees, birds, and animals. Here we will tell a short story about the Indian goddess of language.

Each religion in India has its own god of language. Here it is Brahmanism. The goddess's name is Vak. What is Vak like? What powers does she have? Let's read the following verse from the "Rigveda" Volume 10, Hymn 125:

"I speak these words, welcomed by gods and men: Whom I love, I make him strong, I make him a Brahman, a great seer, wise. I bend the bow for Rudra, to slay the enemy, the hater of the Brahman. I fight for the people; I am in heaven and earth. I am on the summit of the world, my origin is in the waters, therefore I pervade all beings, I reach the heavens. I breathe like the wind, embracing all beings; higher than the sky, greater than the earth, I am so great."

### A Poem

A type of writing called Runes used to be prevalent in Northern Europe. The style of the writing is similar to Latin, and it is undoubtedly a variant of Latin. However, the locals did not believe it, saying that they created it themselves.

The most common saying is to attribute the creation of Runes to a powerful god named Ogmios; but some also attribute it to the greatest deity in Northern Europe, Odin (see the "Ancient History of the North" for records). Below is a poem about Odin creating the writing:

The Runes deep in thought should

know,

even if you want to be among humans,

the most virtuous, powerful, and intelligent.

This is to be read,

this is to be first carved,

this is the first crystallization

of the Most High, Odin.

### Window

— Tank

Who does not gaze at the corner of a window behind willow branches, a bunch of cosmos under a half-rolled gauze curtain; and who does not see a gaze at the sky and a smile that looks directly into the heart in front of the window? However, they disappear together with the warm sunshine, in the howling wind, in the night, leaving only a square of yellow light.

The darkness cannot swallow this dim yellow light. How warm it appears on the dark and cold street. There will be lonely travelers leaning against an orange post, thinking of their own fireside when looking at someone else's window; and there will also be hunters searching for peace and comfort in the cold wind, looking at someone else's small fire to illuminate the mirror of their memories. In the biting cold wind, this little bit of light opens up the hearts of countless wanderers.

If one is a guest in a foreign land for many years, someone said that once they see the light in their own bedroom, they will linger under the window for a long time, not daring or willing to go in resolutely, because looking at one's own light is a kind of happiness.

A unique sentiment is often the most interesting arrangement. Some people like to watch the composition of the night in the evening breeze. Steps, roads, lampposts, windows, searching for a little warmth in the bitter cold, letting the west wind complete this weaving of emotions.

But what if a wanderer suddenly comes back and cannot find their own window?

Once again, someone sees their own light extinguished inside the window; or there is no

Can he endure wandering from one city to another, wandering from one stone path to another? He looked at someone else's broken window, occasionally only half a lamp flower, can he not think about his own broken golden dream?

No window can hold a gentle dream anymore. It only leaks in the cold wind, and no light can warm the wanderer's heart, because the window frame is only a pile of charred remains, and among the broken walls and ruins, there is only a fiery imagination, and the warmth is only a prairie fire on the battlefield and the torch in hand.

The cold will make people think of the window again, our window is the torch of the parade or the prairie fire on the battlefield.

### Pen Cultivation

— Lai Hong

Pen cultivation in other people's snores,

Shivering lamplight attracts full of fatigue;

The pendulum hums that hypnotic tune,

I am passionately in love with the realm of dreams, but I cannot lie down.

The setting sun just collected the flowing light on the lake,

The bat spread out last night's net again;

But the morning sun will revisit the earth in an instant,

I calmly dip my tears dry on the accelerating pen tip.

The line of sight connects the ink dots into a neat formation of geese,

Under the piece of paper, there are fireflies flashing;

The lamp oil is afraid of not letting me finish writing the painful confession in time,

The naughty pen tip is taking this opportunity to be stubborn with me.

The joints of the elbow are making a tight sound,

The too-tight belt makes the waist circumference swell;

Like a rusty window hinge that has been around for years,

The shoulders and the back make it impossible to yawn.

Am I really transformed into an aging youth,

Or is it just that I work from dawn to dusk?

The ink stick paints the inkstone with a dark light,

It's useless to let it disappear if I don't dip it.

The lamp suddenly brightens at this time,

I need to cheer up and can't be like the lamp;

After the vegetable oil runs out, add some moonlight for now,

Before dawn, I have to catch the first bus,

Entertainment World

### Hollywood Also Has a Talent Shortage

— Yong

Due to the outbreak of the European War, a large number of European stars in Hollywood have already set off to return to their countries. Among the most famous are David Niven, Charles Laughton, and Elsa Lanchester. Judging from the recent stalemate in the European War, they will not be able to return to Hollywood in the short term. Therefore, Hollywood is now suffering from an unprecedented talent shortage.

Not only actors are affected, but also technical consultants, technicians, and other talents in the film production engineering field are also in great shortage. One person named J.R. Durham. Mathews, is a Paramount's top technical consultant, British nationality, since completing "The Light That Failed," he has already been ordered to return home. In summary, very few European talents remain in Hollywood today, and the majority of them have volunteered to return home to participate in the war.

But Hollywood cannot stop working because of this. The only way to remedy the situation is to promote a large number of new talents within the country to fill the places of these older members. Robert Preston is the latest discovery, a twenty-one-year-old American youth with a strong physique. For the first time, he has been assigned to co-star with Dorothy Lamour in "Typhoon."

The outbreak of the European War has caused great distress and terror to people all over the world. But young people in America have gained an excellent opportunity to dedicate themselves to the screen. The Hollywood authorities also said kindly: "We are going to train the younger generation."

### Watching a Play Diary

— Xu Chu

A few months ago, I wrote a few days of play diary. The editor said: "Come again," and I replied, "Yes, sir!" Clang, clang, horse, come on!

The twentieth, Mr. Li Boyuan's wife's sixtieth birthday, invited Tian Yunxia, Liu Hanchen, and the entire troupe to see "Knowing Horsepower" and "Zizi" and others. Invited the famous Ms. Li Jiejiehui and Kunqu opera actress Ms. Ling Xiaoxia to guest star in "Visiting the Palace." They both sang beautifully, with clear and melodious voices, and the applause was continuous. Ling Xiaoxia is Yinxia's younger sister. I heard that she is only ten years old. She and Youxia have performed many times in this city and in other places. Innocent and lively, she is somewhat like Chen Yanyan, and also somewhat like the female star Ge Luqi'an. She is truly like the "Milk Valley" advertisement at the Nanjing Grand Theater, a "delicate and exquisite little song queen."

The twenty-fifth, I listened to You Cailing teach Ms. Cai Shuliu to sing Kunqu opera "Flirting with the Qin." You Cailing is a famous actress from the former Zhongfu troupe and is now about fifty years old. When she plays the flute, the air is full of energy, which is really not easy.

The twenty-sixth, I watched the Fudan Drama Society rehearse Ibsen's famous Norwegian play "Nora." This play was adapted by Gu Zhongyi and directed by Wu Tian. It will probably be performed soon, with Ms. Zhu Liangyu playing Nora. Other leading actors include Gu Kangshi, Dai Guangxu, Hu Chenghou, etc. Ms. Zhu is known as "Little Feng" in the school, and it is most appropriate to play "Little Canary" this time. However, the lark does not want to be kept in a cage, and many have already flown out; although there are still many who have not flown out. I said: "Female students in all major middle schools should watch this good play, because this play is speaking for them."

The twenty-seventh, I went to the Xingong Theater to watch a Peking opera dress rehearsal. Because I arrived too late, I only watched the full "Battle of Taiping." This play writes about Hua Yun, who was loyal to the country in the early Ming Dynasty, died in battle with an arrow in his body, which has a lot of significance for the times. The leading actor, Chen Dahu, is known as "Yu Shuyan of Hangzhou" and performed very skillfully. The several high-pitched singing sentences were particularly enjoyable to listen to.

### "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" on the Silver Screen, Renamed "Ge Nen Niang's Martyrdom" - Zhang Shankun Personally Directs

— Hua

"Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" has been performed for more than thirty days now, and it is still sold out at every performance. The contract between the Shanghai Art Society and the Xingong Theater is until December 6. Therefore, "Setting an Example," which was originally intended to be the grand finale of this period, has now been postponed because "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" cannot be stopped, and it has been decided to perform "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" until the contract expires.

The reason why "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" was able to cause a sensation for a while is, first of all, that the script meets the needs of the times, and secondly, it is due to the efforts of all the actors and staff. After watching this play, Zhang Shankun, the owner of Xinhua, discussed with the playwright Wei Ruhui and decided to put it on the silver screen. At that time, he also suggested inviting Tang Ruoqing to guest star as Ge Nen Niang as before. Now everything is ready, and filming will start immediately, and it is scheduled to be released on New Year's Day at the Huguang Grand Theater in Shanghai. However, Tang Ruoqing may be leaving Shanghai, so Gu Lanjun will play the role of Ge Nen Niang. Zheng Zhilong and Cai Rusi will be played by the original actors Xu Li and Tu Guangqi. Zheng Chenggong, who could not be loyal to both his country and his father, has not yet been selected. Zou Taishang is AB for Liu Qiong and Gu Yelu. They are both basic actors of Xinhua, so if Gu Yelu plays Zheng Chenggong, Liu Qiong will play Sun Kejian. The director is Zhang Shankun himself. The name of the play has also been changed to "Ge Nen Niang's Martyrdom."

### Wing Lou, The Joint Charity Performance's Two Checks

— Ti Gong

Wing Lou's joint charity performance at the end of last year was a great success, so they are preparing for another one this year. There are two programs in preparation, one is the "Tāng Dà Láng Jūn" starring in the "First, Second, Third, and Fourth Linked Rings," and it has been decided that Zhou Xinfang's "Zhū Guāngzǔ," Gao Bosui's "Jì Jīn," Zhou Yihua and Bao Xiaodie's double performance of "Dēng Yǔ," Chen Tingchao's "Lord Péng," and Sun Lanting's "Big Head" will participate in the supporting roles. The remaining front-stage plays are still under discussion. The other one is the drama "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty." This play was performed at the Xuan Palace and set the highest box office record for dramas. The Wing Lou members who saw it all felt a little bit tempted, so after Pei Lin and I encouraged them, a large number of people automatically participated in the roles. As of now, the list includes Xin Fang, Sun Ke Xian, Bosui as Zheng Chenggong, Su Wen as Nèn Niáng, Xi Chun as Ma Jinzi, Hui Cong as Niáng, Ting Chao as Yu Danxin, Tian as Zheng Zhilong, Zhifang as Zheng Hongda, Haisheng as Bolo, and Dalang as Zheng Cang'er. Pei Lin originally wanted to play Cai He, but because the doctor forbade him from going on stage, he is preparing to let me make a fool of myself. Ting Chao has already obtained the consent of the original author, Mr. Wei Ru Hui, for the script and sent a copy. I have asked Mr. Zhu Duanjun to be the director, and he has also agreed. It seems that no one in the old opera circle has inquired about dramas before. This time, with the addition of people from the literary and art circles in the mixed performance, there is no doubt that this "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty" will cause a great sensation. If this check can be cashed into "cash" after the Carlton's opposite box, then we are preparing to take this opportunity to raise some funds to allocate for charitable purposes, and the audience who love dramas will probably have to spend a little "cash."

Sui Han Drama Society Since Xi He, Jin Ge, Ming, Ru Hong, Ge Zheng and others founded the Sui Han Drama Society, it has been more than eight months. It was originally scheduled to hold a large autumn performance in mid-October, but it was cancelled due to location issues. Recently, the club will hold its first practical performance at the end of next month. The performances will be three one-act comedies: "What to Do," "Napoleon Behind the Scenes," and "Mother-in-Law." The actors are generally played by veteran drama figures such as Chen Heng, Ling Xiao, Jing Wei, Ye Ru, Cao E, and Yang Xian.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

Two Stand-Offish Young Masters in the Peking Amateur Opera World

In Máhuā Hutong in the western part of Peking City, there is a large mansion, one residence with two courtyards, resembling the Rong and Ning Mansions in the "Dream of the Red Chamber." This residence belongs to the two brothers of the former Qing Chancellor Rong (Lu). The east mansion (Rong Lu's) is wider and more substantial, and the young master of the west mansion (Rong Lu's nephew) is named Rong Zhifeng. People in Peking call him Fourth Master Rong. This man is now over fifty years old and is addicted to opera. He once funded the creation of the Zheng Yin Society amateur opera troupe, serving as its president. Figures such as Yu Junfeng (Jing), Wang Huafu (Chou), and Wòjū Shì (Lao Dan) are all the backbone figures in his amateur opera troupe. He once studied at the aristocratic school in the former capital. During the Guangxu and Xuantong periods, all the famous actors of the time often went in and out of his mansion. He was particularly close to Hou Junshan, a famous Qinqiang dan actor. During this period, phonographs had not yet been invented to play sound from wax records in picture form. At that time, many masters and dukes purchased dozens of wax, (shaped like the bamboo tube at the bottom of the huqin. The size is also slightly the same. It is prepared to be used to record its exquisite music when inviting famous orders, so as to leave a souvenir. Rong-Jun's collection includes Wang Guifen's "Hua Hill," "Catching and Releasing Cao," and "Taking Chengdu," Jin Xiushan's "Assassinating King Liao," and Long Yunfu's "Fishing More Turtles," etc. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, I went north to record sound and planned to ask Rong-Jun to help contact Shuyan Shi to record several records. Because it was after the Double Ninth Festival, Rong matched Yu and others with a cricket competition that was approaching, and the location was in Rong's west flower courtyard. Shuyan must come every day. One day Rong said, "Since you came to Peking, you have tasted all the famous restaurants. I will invite you to a small drink tomorrow. I will order someone to prepare court cuisine and the white meat platter for sacrifices, and cook rice with the old rice (yellow in color and large in grain) under the ground for you to taste." The next day, I went to the appointment, and the dishes were all what I had never seen before, and the taste of the white meat was particularly good. After the meal, I turned on the wax cylinders recorded by Wang and others. Although the sound was low, the charm was particularly good. (152)
