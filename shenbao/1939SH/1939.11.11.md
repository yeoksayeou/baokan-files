### Comments on Speculation

Shanghai has long been known domestically as a city of speculative markets. Unbeknownst to many, the speculation usually focuses on the exchanges. However, since the August 13th Incident, the scope has gradually expanded, encompassing foreign exchange, gold, foreign currencies, cotton yarn, flour, and even cloth, rice, and daily necessities. Almost everything has become a target for speculation. With the outbreak of the European War, the interest in speculation has intensified. All foreign goods, whether oxen, horses, or otherwise, are indiscriminately collected and hoarded, creating a period of great prosperity. However, government bonds, once the focus of speculators, now fluctuate with the situation and are no longer the center of speculation. Nevertheless, the desire to escape with capital and the ambition to get rich by luck remain fervent in the hearts of speculators. Since the beginning of this year, foreign stocks have become the sole favorite of speculative elements. New highs are frequently reported, only to quickly become relics of the past. Stocks such as those of the Reemtsma & Ruyong Dockyard, the Yieh Sung Dockyard, the Kailan Mining Administration, the Ewo Cotton Mill, the International Trust, the China Land Reclamation, the China Steel Corporation, and the Shanghai Bank experienced the fastest growth. In the rubber stock sector, stocks like Anglo-Dutch Plantations of Java, Anglo-Java Rubber, and the Shanghai Land Investment Company also saw significant increases. Other stocks have also followed the same trend. This is the recent outline of speculative activities.

The reason why the speculation has been rampant in the past two years is that commodity prices have been rising steadily with no hope of falling. Any undertaking results in profit, which encourages the trend of hoarding for profit. Even those with modest assets try to pool resources to get involved. Those who become wealthy through speculation reinvest their profits, always finding favorable opportunities. They boast of their accurate predictions, hitting the mark repeatedly, making it extremely difficult to persuade them to change course and seek price stabilization.

From this, we can see that there is no hope of curbing speculation because of the unstable situation, which is why speculation is so prevalent. However, there are also reasons why we cannot take such an optimistic view of speculation. The psychology of speculators must be rooted in the belief that "every move will seize the opportunity and prevail in the world." Otherwise, why speculate? Having this confidence, they may not know whether the opportunity they invest in will match their predicted expectations. If it does not, failure and setbacks will follow. If it does, and they make several profits on a single investment, they will be overjoyed and elated. But can they guarantee that they will not go again when they are pleased? And if they go again, can they guarantee that they will still be able to devise extraordinary plans and win? Moreover, those who gain by improper means will lose by improper means. At the beginning of the European War, Shanghai residents scoured for foreign goods, leaving no stone unturned. Prices soared more than once a day, but before long, those who thought they could become as wealthy as during the European War in the early Republic of China were disappointed, even suffering significant losses. This is because imitating the old ways in today's situation is to be oblivious to the times. They do not consider the quantity of goods in the market or the actual state of daily consumption. Blindly following others, they rush to acquire goods, only to realize after the event that while what they hold may not be entirely useless, it is all stagnant stock. This is also a neglect of the situation. Hesitation leads to disaster, which is why speculation often fails. Selling when prices fall and buying when prices rise is what they consider smart market behavior. But they do not realize that the heavier the accumulation, the lighter the boat and the heavier the load. In the face of great winds and waves, can they guarantee that they will not capsize? This is also a failure to guard against the harm of greed. Since it is called an "opportunity," it is fleeting. And since it is called "speculation," how can one be sure of hitting the mark? The difficulty of speculation is extreme. So, are there people who have made a fortune through speculation? There may be a few, but they are extremely rare, flourishing for a time and failing in an instant. This is a common sight in the speculative market. Furthermore, speculators often rely on luck, so they often listen to astrologers and fortune tellers, being fooled and deceived without realizing it. To make investment decisions based on astrology is to misunderstand the nature and function of speculation. And since most speculative elements in Shanghai are like this, it is clear that they do not have true insight.

The reason why we worry about speculators is that today's Shanghai market is controlled by speculators who hoard for profit. So, when they hoard goods and sell them, market prices will be level; but when they gather resources, prices will soar. Market prices are pushed higher and higher, which should secretly delight speculators. But how many of these high-priced hoarded goods are actually traded? In reality, there is mostly a price but no market. Moreover, stocks have a limited quantity. The higher they are pushed, the more likely sellers will be unable to deliver due to excessive short positions, and buyers will be unable to take delivery due to excessive prices. Even if stocks are bought at high prices, receiving a normal rate of return is still not a well-considered plan. The high cost of living in Shanghai has its special reasons, and the fueling of the flames by speculators also contributes to it. They do not realize that the so-called profits of speculators are mostly like flowers in a mirror and the moon's reflection in the water. Even if everything goes according to the speculator's wishes, a few become rich while the masses remain poor. What is the point of being rich then? Therefore, we know that the awakening of speculators cannot be delayed.

### Britain's Far East Policy Remains Unchanged; Soviet Union Continues to Aid China; Sun Ke Admits Soviet Loans Used to Purchase Military Supplies; Expresses Satisfaction with Meeting with British Foreign Secretary

London "Financial Times" reported today that reliable sources revealed that China and the Soviet Union had recently concluded an agreement under which the Soviet Union would lend China 60 million pounds in gold to purchase war materials. The Chinese government agreed to reserve a large portion of its production of tungsten, manganese, and antimony to meet the needs of the Soviet Union. However, according to Sun Ke in London, speaking to a Reuters reporter, this news is not accurate. However, the Soviet Union frequently provides credit and loans to China and exchanges various Chinese products for war materials. He declined to specify the amount. (Reuters, 10th)

London – Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan of China, is currently visiting London for a short stay. Today, a Reuters reporter met with him after his meeting with Foreign Secretary Halifax. Sun said that the government's policy towards China has not changed and that he is very satisfied. He said that his conversation with the British Foreign Secretary was very encouraging. Sun Ke then expressed his opinion that the Soviet Union's Far East policy would continue as before, saying that the Soviet Union has always assisted China and will continue to do so in the future. He said that he was certain that the Soviet Union had no intention of going to war with Japan, but only wanted to resist Japanese aggression. He added that the Soviet Union's military strength is superior to that of Japan, so resisting Japan is relatively easy, as evidenced by the Battle of Nomonhan. When asked by a Reuters reporter about the possibility of peace in the Far East, Sun Ke replied that if moderate elements in Japan regain power, peace could be discussed on a suitable basis. However, generally speaking, peace in the Far East seems to depend on the outcome of the European war, but this is only his personal opinion. Sun Ke continued that he was certain that Wang Jingwei would not be able to absorb influential Chinese from the political or business circles in Chongqing to help him organize a pro-Japanese government. Sun Ke strongly denied the rumors of Soviet troops invading Xinjiang, saying that he had recently met several Chinese people from Xinjiang and learned that this was not the case, and that it would be very difficult for the Soviet Union to send troops across the water-scarce desert into Xinjiang. Sun Ke later expressed the opinion that the Soviet Union currently does not want to join the European war, but said that the Allied countries should try their best to keep the Soviet Union neutral. He said that the Soviet Union may not be able to supply Germany with large quantities of oil and iron due to its own needs, but it could transport food to Germany. The Allied countries should purchase as much of the Soviet Union's surplus production as possible. Sun Ke did not mention that he arrived in Paris a month ago via Moscow and Warsaw, and is now in London to continue communication. If other cabinet members have some free time, he plans to meet with them. Sun Ke will stay here for a few days before going to Paris, as Sun Ke's office is currently in Paris. (Reuters, 9th)

### China Decides to Resist Japan to the End; Needs a Fair and Honorable Peace – Hu Shih Delivers Speech in the United States

New York – Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih said in a speech today that despite the European War, Britain and France are still assisting China, and the Soviet Union is actively assisting China with loans and military supplies, entering China through the back door, namely through Myanmar and Vietnam. (Reuters, 10th)

New York – Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hu Shih, delivered a speech last night at the Biel Hotel to 300 participants in the "Bowl of Rice" movement, which costs US$25 per person, saying, "You can believe me that China will never make peace with Japan unless it can achieve a fair peace." Hu praised the United States' concern for the Far East issue, saying, "The United States' abolition of the Japanese-American commercial treaty can be said to be the United States already using its sharpest weapon. If this weapon is used properly, it can promote peace, implement justice, and prevent the sacrifices of the Chinese people from being in vain." The longer China can hold off Japan, the stronger China's position against Japan will be. "China's future is entirely in the hands of the Chinese people. If we can fight Japan for 28 months, or for another five years, or even longer, our power to negotiate with Japan will become stronger and stronger. Therefore, in the future, Japanese militarists will voluntarily accept a fair peace. Unless this day comes, we will never stop the war." He also said, "This Sino-Japanese War has caused Japan losses eight times greater than those of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 and the Russo-Japanese War. Japan's exchange rate is also several times higher than in 1931. Since the outbreak of the war, Japan has shipped as much as US$511,000,000 in gold to the United States." It is reported that Japan's annual gold production is only US$24,000,000, but its need for gold is as high as US$250,000,000. It is also reported that the "Bowl of Rice" movement in the United States plans to raise US$200,000, and that at least US$10,000 will be raised here tonight.

Tokyo – According to Army Minister Hata Shunroku, speaking to Osaka newspaper reporters today, the China-Japan problem is becoming increasingly complex due to changes in the international situation, but Japan should still adhere to its determination to establish a "new order in East Asia."

The reporter also asked whether the new Soviet Ambassador Smetanin would visit Foreign Minister Nomura soon, as reported. The spokesman replied that the Soviet ambassador had not made such contact, and as far as he knew, the Soviet ambassador planned to rest a bit after his long journey.

This has now been recognized by the Dutch government. (Reuters, 10th)

### Startling German Bombing Case; Bizarre Details Still Under Thorough Investigation; Conflicting Theories on Internal Conspiracy or Foreign Instigation; Hundreds of Suspects Arrested in Germany's Massive Manhunt

Munich – The perpetrators and background of the Munich bombing incident have not yet been identified and are currently under active investigation. Police officers arrested hundreds of people on the night of the 8th. Railway stations, hotels, and roads leading out of the city were given special attention by the police to prevent the escape of the perpetrators. Those arrested were immediately released after proving their innocence. (Haitong, 10th)

Berlin – German Police Chief Himmler is now in Berlin, and Inspector General Wulff of his headquarters has been ordered to be responsible for investigating the Munich bombing case. According to Himmler, based on the clues obtained from the investigation, the masterminds must be abroad. Therefore, the German government has instructed its diplomatic representatives in foreign countries to offer a reward of 300,000 marks for any information leading to the breaking of the case. (Haitong, 10th)

Berlin – After the Munich bombing case occurred, Police Chief Himmler appointed a committee of experts to conduct an investigation. As of this time, although it is difficult to draw a conclusion about the background and perpetrators, it has been determined that this conspiracy was not carried out hastily, but was a carefully planned and well-prepared plot. The explosives were equipped with a timing mechanism. The committee members are now thoroughly investigating the truth based on the clues obtained. (Haitong, 10th)

Paris – Newspapers here believe that the Munich bombing case was the work of the German secret police, comparable to the Reichstag fire. (Reuters, 10th)

New York – The New York Times commented on the Munich bombing case today, saying that if it is believed that this was not arranged by Hitler, then it is almost impossible to say that this does not contain the implication that a part of the Nazi Party is willing to betray the party. (Reuters, 10th)

### Hitler Escapes Danger; United States Does Not Offer Condolences for Now; Hull Says Formal Report Needed; Many Neutral Countries Send Congratulatory Telegrams

Washington – Regarding the bombing in Munich, Germany, when Secretary of State Hull met with reporters yesterday, a reporter asked whether it was customary for the US government to send a telegram of congratulations when a foreign head of state was attacked but survived. Secretary of State Hull immediately replied that a decision could only be made after receiving a report and ascertaining whether a congratulatory gesture was appropriate. (Havas, 10th)

Washington – Official circles here want to know the details of the case and whether it is as transmitted by telegraph, and not the same trick as the Reichstag fire of the past. They want to know whether the explosion was of a military nature or an accidental event before expressing official opinions. (Reuters, 9th)

Rome – Newspapers throughout Italy expressed indignation at the attempted assassination of Hitler and expressed happiness that Hitler left the scene early. The Italian ambassador to Germany has telegraphed German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to express condolences, and Italian King Victor Emmanuel and Mussolini have also telegraphed Hitler to congratulate him on his escape. (Reuters, 10th)

Berlin – Italian King Victor Emmanuel and Prime Minister Mussolini have sent telegrams to Head of State Hitler congratulating him on his safe escape. Hitler replied separately, expressing his gratitude. (Haitong, 10th)

Moscow – The Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee has requested that German Ambassador Schulenburg convey to the head of state Hitler its indignation at the bombing in Munich and express its condolences for the deceased. (Havas, 10th)

Amsterdam – Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands has telegraphed Hitler to congratulate him on his escape. (Reuters, 10th)

Vatican – The Pope telegraphed Hitler to console him on the danger he faced in Munich last night. (Reuters, 10th)

Berlin – Head of State Hitler received Italian Ambassador Attolico at the Prime Minister's Office yesterday. Attolico, representing the government, offered condolences on Hitler's escape in Munich. At the same time, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and King Carol II of Romania telegraphed Hitler to express their congratulations and condolences. (Haitong, 9th)

Berlin – The news issued by foreign news agencies regarding the recent situation of Head of State Hitler is inconsistent and even conflicting. For example, some say that Hitler is hiding in the Thurigian countryside, while others say that Hitler is now receiving guests at the Prime Minister's Office in Berlin. In fact, this afternoon, Hitler had a conversation with the Papal Envoy, who represented the Pope and the diplomatic corps stationed in Germany to congratulate Head of State Hitler. (Haitong, 10th)

Paris – The bombing in Munich, Germany, has been commented on by various morning newspapers here, all saying that this is a trick of the country's political police. Head of State Hitler has thus benefited, and the slander against Britain will not be without effect. On the contrary, it can be used as an excuse to purge dissidents internally and invade Belgium and the Netherlands externally. The Radical Party's "L'Ordre" newspaper reported that "previously, all plots to harm Hitler and Goering were kept secret by the German News Agency, a semi-official organization in the country. Whether the alleged masterminds are real can be imagined. The propaganda campaign conducted by the country's newspapers and radio stations is exactly the same as that conducted after the arson of the German Congress in 1933. The sudden accusation of the British intelligence agency is obviously intended to leave room for action against Belgium and the Netherlands, and to establish naval and air bases in those countries, and to threaten Britain more directly." The right-wing "Le Figaro" newspaper reported that "this case is the prelude to Germany's new aggression, which may be directed against the Netherlands. At that time, Nazi Party members will offer explanations, saying that this is due to British provocation and there is no choice but to do so. At the same time, the moderates of the Nazi Party will be eliminated under the pretext of eliminating enemy staff. In short, if this case is a genuine murder case, it must have been committed by Nazi Party members who opposed Hitler. In any case, this is another clear proof of the unrest in the hearts of the German people." (Havas, 10th)

### Dispute Occurs on German-Dutch Border

Amsterdam – A shooting occurred yesterday in Venlo, a town on the border between the Netherlands and Germany. The details are very mysterious. Responsible officials here are unwilling to make any statement before clarifying the truth. All that is known is that a German car stopped abruptly in front of the Dutch customs, allowing customs officials to inspect it. At the same time, a Dutch car was driving towards Germany and stopped in front of the customs, waiting for inspection. Unexpectedly, the German car suddenly crossed the border into the Netherlands and stopped near this car. Several German armed customs officials also followed. Soon, several gunshots were heard, and a passenger in the Dutch car was immediately shot and injured. The German customs officials then dragged him into their country and ordered his companions to follow. The Dutch customs officials were unable to intervene in such a sudden incident. The identity of the person abducted has not yet been identified. The general public is deeply concerned that the German authorities may use this incident as an excuse to take military action immediately. (Havas, 10th)

Berlin - Political figures here discussed news from Belgium today, saying that people there are worried and believe that Germany will soon violate the neutrality of Belgium and the Netherlands. German political figures believe that this is the result of enemy propaganda.

(Haitong Electric, 9th)

Berlin - Regarding reports from foreign news agencies that large German cavalry units are concentrated on the Dutch border, this matter was denied here.

### The Dutch-Belgian Peace Movement is Not Subject to Foreign Pressure: The Dutch Foreign Minister's Statement; The Romanian King Responds with a Telegram

Amsterdam - Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens spoke in the House of Representatives today, denying that the Dutch-Belgian peace movement was made under foreign pressure. German newspapers pointed out that the Dutch attitude was to assist Britain and undermine neutrality, which is unfair. The Netherlands and other neutral countries may well give Britain the guarantees it is willing to accept and avoid the detention of ships, but the Netherlands is not prepared to do so, because the Netherlands does not want to be a tool of Britain to harm Germany, just as the Netherlands does not want to be a tool of Germany to harm Britain. Anyone who invades the Netherlands will be resisted. (Reuters, 10th)

### Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Now at a Critical Juncture; New Dutch Instructions Arrive in Moscow; Negotiations Between the Two Sides Are Still in Progress

Moscow - After receiving new instructions from the government yesterday, the Finnish delegation reopened meetings with the Soviet authorities for more than an hour. Stalin was also present. The results of the talks were not announced. Observers believe that the Soviet-Finnish negotiations have now reached a decisive stage. (United Press, 10th)

Moscow - Finnish representatives Paasikivi and Finance Minister Tanner went to the Kremlin at 6:00 pm today to meet with Stalin and Foreign People's Commissar Molotov for talks. According to well-informed sources, both sides have made concessions and a solution can be reached soon. The most important of the demands put forward by the Soviet Union are two: one is to establish a naval base at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland, and the other is to revise the border near Leningrad, moving the Finnish border ten kilometers westward, and then designating the border area as a demilitarized zone. It is reported that Finland has agreed to cede the three islands of Seiskari, Lavansaari, and Tytärsaari (all at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland) to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union will cede territory in the Galeria area as a condition of exchange. On the Soviet side, it no longer insists on signing a mutual assistance treaty with Finland, as it has established with Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, but only to strengthen the existing non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Finland, and require that Finland cannot participate in any treaty or group that is directly or indirectly detrimental to the Soviet Union. (Havas, 9th)

Copenhagen - The "National News" correspondent in the Finnish capital telegraphed that there is reason to believe that the talks between the Finnish and Soviet delegations in Moscow have taken a critical turn. (Reuters, 10th)

### Direct Train Service Between Germany and Romania, Through Soviet-Occupied Areas, Will Be Realized Soon

Berlin - The direct train service between Germany and Romania, which is of great importance to commerce between Germany and Romania, will hold an inauguration ceremony within days. The line runs from Upper Silesia through Krakow, Lviv, Stanisławów, Sniatyn, and other towns to Chernivtsi in Romania. In order to facilitate this matter, the Soviet Union agreed that the Polish territory merged into the Soviet Union through which the train passes will not adopt the Soviet-style track gauge. Economic circles here say that this direct train service is very important. Although its freight is more expensive than water transport, the time spent is very different. (Haitong Electric, 10th)

### Developments in the Political Control Case; Copies of Confidential Letters Presented to the Court by the Plaintiff as Evidence

London - Today, the High Court continued to hear Princess Hohenlohe's case against Lord Rothermere, owner of the "Daily Mail," for breach of contract and seeking compensation. Copies of several of the most confidential letters between Rothermere and continental dignitaries were presented to the court as evidence. The princess testified that she had repeatedly met with Hitler on the orders of the Lord. The court asked about a letter from Hitler to Rothermere, the opening line of which was "Thank you for your kindness in forwarding some suggestions to me." The princess replied that she conveyed this suggestion to Hitler on behalf of the Lord. She was often ordered to transfer various gifts, such as gold watches, cigarette cases, and embroideries, to the German head of state. The princess also said that the Lord was rich and generous, and what she is asking for now is only to repay her expenses. When the British King held the coronation ceremony, she followed the Lord's instructions and tried her best to recruit German representatives. At least five German representatives resided in her residence, and she often held banquets and concerts to entertain them. Since the newspaper published the news that she was engaged in espionage work, she was abandoned in social gatherings. The princess claimed during cross-examination that a bundle of documents she presented to the court contained many confidential letters between the Lord and European dignitaries, all of which were photographed and preserved with the Lord's permission. The lawyer asked about a copy of a letter from the German Crown Prince to the Lord. The princess replied that this copy was obtained with the consent of the German Crown Prince from the Crown Prince's correspondence manager. The German Crown Prince later said that he deeply regretted writing this letter. The princess later said that Weidemann, the former adjutant to Hitler, was her close friend. She met him in Paris the day before Weidemann went to San Francisco to take office. She also said that she obtained a copy of a letter from Lord Rothermere to Hitler from the German Chancellery. At this point in the trial, the court announced a recess. (Reuters, 9th)

At that time, this New World will maintain it, waiting for the achievements of civilization to be re-popularized in the world. (Reuters, 10th)

### London Celebrates the Lord Mayor's Show; Not as Lively as in Previous Years

London - The Lord Mayor's Show is the most joyous festival for the people of London. The decorations and celebrations have always been very lively, but the situation is different today. This is unprecedented in 109 years. When the new Lord Mayor, Sir William Coxen, was sworn in at the court, only a dozen or so prominent London figures went to observe the ceremony in cars. All officials carried gas masks, and their cars were guarded by soldiers on motorbikes. In previous years, the banquet at the Guildhall was extremely lively, but now, due to the blackout, it was changed to a smaller banquet held during the day and did not invite female guests. Many cabinet members attended the banquet, and commissioners from the autonomous regions and India stationed in London were guests of honor. During the banquet, Chancellor Simon read Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech, and the retiring mayor also announced that the Red Cross funds had reached £700,000. (Reuters, 9th)

### West Ukrainian Representatives Declare to Refute Rumors

Moscow - Representatives of the West Ukrainian National Assembly, Professor Studynsky of Lviv, Pankiv of Rohatyn, Stanisławów Province, Gogol of Brody, Tarnopol Province, Olesiuk, and Ms. Sikharubina of Bobryk Village, Stanisławów Province, recently published a declaration in Soviet newspapers, saying,

"The British Reuters news agency disseminated a 'correct' message from the 'Polish-Romanian border' on November 7 regarding the results of the West Ukrainian National Assembly representative elections. It is claimed that only 25% of rural voters and 50% of urban voters participated in the National Assembly elections. This news is purely fabricated. The West Ukrainian people did indeed show unprecedented unity, activity, and organizational strength in the National Assembly elections on October 22. The elections were held in accordance with absolutely democratic election laws. Among the 4,766,175 voters, 4,433,997 voted, accounting for 92.83% of the total. All these facts are well-known to the world and leave no room for dispute. Reuters's wild barking of rumors is incomprehensible. Moreover, it is claimed that the message was sent from the 'Polish-Romanian border,' and we dare to tell the lords of Poland in London that the so-called 'Polish border' has long passed and there is absolutely no possibility of it coming again. All that exists now is the Soviet-Romanian border. It is unnecessary for us to refute why those in London who are accustomed to using others to pick up tickets in the fire instructed Reuters to spread such rumors. What we should point out is that the reason these gentlemen spread rumors is because the change in the situation has made them feel uneasy in their dreams. They are accustomed to sitting back and reaping huge profits from the Drohobych oil fields and the banks of West Ukraine, which have now become things that they will never see again. Due to the resolution of the West Ukrainian National Assembly, these oil fields, banks, and large industries have all been nationalized. The treasures that British and French imperialists entrusted to certain lackeys, the Polish lords, 20 years ago, ordering them to extract and plunder them on their behalf, have now become the public property of the Ukrainian nation. The British and French imperialists can no longer control the fate of the West Ukrainian people. 92.83% of the voters have unanimously resolved not to freely hand over their freedom to foreigners again. Isn't this making those gentlemen feel distressed and pained? However, all the people of West Ukraine will definitely do their best to defend this regained freedom. The great Soviet Union and the invincible Workers' and Peasants' Red Army will forever be the guarantee of this freedom. The West Ukrainian working masses will sweep away all the tricks of provocation and alienation under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and strive to build a new, free, and bright life, and will forever be members of the Soviet multi-ethnic family."

### Chinese Troops Control the Suburbs of Jiangmen and Xinhui; Japanese Troops' Attempt to Invade Samshui Fails; Japanese Troops in Shunde Are Transferred to Support Jiangmen and Xinhui; Zhongshan Suffers Extremely Severe Disasters Due to Devastation

Hong Kong correspondence: The Japanese troops invading Xinzeng and Jiangmen in Guangdong Province have recently threatened to invade Samshui, the commercial center of the central district, and have advanced along the Xin Kai road line. On the 27th, 28th, and 30th of last month, Japanese aircraft repeatedly bombed Samshui, and the ferries of Xinhui, Kaiping, Taishan, and Enping were also attacked by Japanese aircraft, intending to assist the Japanese troops in advancing rapidly. However, by the 31st, large numbers of Chinese troops had successively reinforced along the Xin Kai road line and engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese troops in the vicinity of Da Xiao Mei and Lian Tang. The Japanese troops were defeated, leaving dozens of corpses, and retreated in a mess back to Xinhui. The Chinese troops took advantage of the victory and pursued, and have recovered Da Xiao Mei. The Japanese troops defended stubbornly, firing cannons at the Shatidi Bridge and Jinniu Mountain west of the city. There was also contact between the two armies near the Fenjiang River, but the fighting was not as intense as before. There were no major battles on the Xinhe, Jiangfo, and Jiangzhuo roads. The Japanese troops stubbornly defended Jiangmen, and its suburbs have been controlled by Chinese troops. The situation in Samshui has also eased. Many of the ferries in Siyi have also resumed service, but after passing Sanjiang, they still need to be transferred by long boats. However, the Japanese troops' ambition to invade has not been curbed. It is recently heard that the Japanese troops in Daliang, Rongqi, Guizhou, and other places in Shunde have also been transferred to reinforce Jiangmen and Xinhui, but the number of people is unknown. At present, the majority of the Japanese troops in Jiangmen and Xinhui are concentrated in the vicinity of Xin Kai Road and Licun area of Jiang Fo Road near Xinhui. The Second Detachment of the First Guerrilla Area recently attacked Daliang, Rongqi, Guizhou, and other places in Shunde and was very successful. The former Xinshun Special Detachment of the Fifth Guerrilla Area, the Zhou Hanling Department, also carried out night attacks on Japanese troops on the river surface at the intersection of Xinshun. At that time, a Japanese ship traveling to Guangzhou and Jiangmen passed by and was intercepted by the unit, fighting each other for several hours, killing many Japanese and puppet troops.

The Japanese navy previously invaded Zhongshan, Hengmen, Dieshi, Jinzhong, and other places and was severely attacked by the Chinese local troops, suffering heavy casualties. The army also suffered considerable losses. According to a military intelligence report yesterday, the bodies of the Japanese navy officers and soldiers killed in action have been completely transported back to Guangzhou for cremation. Peng Dongyuan, chairman of the puppet Guangdong Security Committee, actually led a group of people to hold a memorial service for the Japanese navy officers and soldiers killed in action in the large open space in front of the Japanese naval headquarters on the 29th of last month. Japanese military officers also attended the ceremony. As for Zhongshan County, which has been repeatedly devastated by Japanese troops, the damage is enormous. The first, second, and fourth districts have become fields of rubble and scorched earth, with desolate scenes. At present, disaster victims are everywhere, suffering from hunger and cold. In addition, they have lost their homes and are living in the open, or they are suffering from serious illnesses and moaning. They lament the lack of livelihood and feel that it is difficult to prolong their lingering lives. They are displaced and cannot be described. According to statistics, more than 500 people were killed by Japanese troops or died of fright. More than 2,300 houses were destroyed, and more than 2,700 households were robbed. The people's property losses totaled more than 2,917,170 yuan. More than 1,650 women were insulted. The suffering of the disaster is truly unbearable to speak of. In Bao'an County, Japanese troops have been strengthening the defensive works in Nantou, Shenzhen, and other places for days to prevent Chinese troops from counterattacking. They have also laid landmines on the Baoshen, Yankou, and Shashen roads. In addition, the airfield that the Japanese troops previously built in the wasteland behind the Tianmian Village on the Baoshen Road has now been suspended because it is not suitable for military use. At 6:00 am one day, the Japanese artillery team in Shenzhen Datouling fired two or thirty shells in succession. The Japanese troops in Shenzhen were preparing one after another. Later, it was learned that the Japanese artillery in Datouling had mistakenly thought that the Chinese troops were attacking and fired cannons to prevent it. At present, the Japanese troops in Bao'an all stay in defensive works and trenches at night, and only come out to act during the day. Every morning, they must fire cannons into the air. The Chinese troops are well aware that the morale of the Japanese troops is depressed and have sent teams to completely encircle the periphery of the Japanese troops in Bao'an, cutting off the Japanese troops' transportation lines and waiting for an opportunity to attack.

### Rampant Pirate Activity in Fujian Province's Wu Islet, Coordinating with Japanese Forces; Military Authorities Maintain Strict Defense

Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the start of the War of Resistance, several coastal islands in Fujian Province have fallen. In the southern Fujian region, these include Jinmen (Quemoy), Xiamen (Amoy), and Meizhou islands. In the Fujian-Guangdong region, there are Pingtan, Chuanshi, Dongsha, and Nangan islands. Of these, Jinmen, Xiamen, and Chuanshi islands are garrisoned by Japanese troops. Pingtan, Meizhou, Dongsha, and Nangan islands are occupied by pirates under Japanese command. Puppet organizations have been established on Jinmen, Xiamen, and Pingtan islands, with Chinese traitors serving as puppet county magistrates and puppet mayors. The pirates call themselves the "Fujian People's Army" and specialize in raiding the coastal areas and waters of Fuqing, Lianjiang, Changle, Putian, Xianyou, and Hui'an counties, seizing young men, women, grain, money, which they exchange with the Japanese army for weapons. At the same time, the Japanese army also lays mines at various harbors to prohibit ships from entering and exiting, in order to blockade the province's economy. However, because the Chinese defenses are very strict, the Japanese army and pirates, despite repeated attempts to launch joint incursions, have been unable to advance onto the mainland. Since mid-August, the Japanese side has mobilized naval and air forces to launch large-scale attacks on Dongshan Island in southern Fujian. More than ten attacks have been repelled by the defending troops, inflicting heavy casualties. These casualties are being continuously transported back to Taiwan from Xiamen for burial and treatment. The offensive has stalled. The number of Japanese warships along the coast has also greatly decreased compared to May and June. The two important ports of Fuzhou and Quanzhou are usually without any Japanese warship sightings. If one or two ships arrive, they leave after only a few hours. Only the waters off Xiamen often have twelve or thirteen Japanese warships anchored. Therefore, foreign ships from Shanghai and Hong Kong can occasionally enter, and the prices of cloth, medicine, cotton yarn, and oil have gradually fallen. However, Japanese goods are often mixed in. Recently, in the Hanjiang area, a batch of Japanese goods worth more than one million yuan was seized. The pirates occupying Meizhou Island have been repeatedly repelled by the Chinese army but seize opportunities to invade again. Currently, a portion of the island is still occupied by pirates, who use it as a base to harass the coasts of Putian, Xianyou, Fuqing, and Hui'an counties. Therefore, the military authorities have ordered a blockade of the coasts of the above four counties, strictly prohibiting ships from traveling to and from Meizhou, under the penalty of being treated as collaborators. Foreign ships are also prohibited from entering and exiting the Xiuyu port of Hui'an and the Haikou port of Fuqing. On the other hand, the coastal district governments of Fuqing, Putian, Xianyou, and Hui'an are ordered to strictly inspect household registrations. The district governments, together with the garrison troops, are responsible for ensuring that each Lianbao (collective security unit) conducts an inspection every week, and, according to the Baojia system, the residence and movement of people should be accurately registered to prevent bandits and traitors from hiding among them.

### Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation, From the 1st to the 7th of This Month (Continued from Yesterday)

Guangdong Front: In Sanshui, Xijiang, on the mornings of the 3rd and 4th, the Japanese forces advanced towards Yangmei through Xinan town. The Chinese forces used mobile tactics to surround and severely attack the Japanese troops. By noon, the Japanese forces broke through and retreated to Sanshui. The Chinese forces took advantage of the victory to pursue them, inflicting many casualties. On the 6th, our air force attacked Guangzhou and encountered Japanese aircraft while passing through Sanshui, resulting in a fierce air battle. Three Japanese aircraft were shot down, and another three were heavily damaged and fled. As for the Japanese forces in Jiangmen and Xinhui, on the morning of the 4th, they launched an attack on Duruan under the cover of artillery fire. The Chinese forces calmly responded and fought for half a day before the Japanese forces retreated along their original route, leaving countless corpses behind. In the Chao'an area of the East River, on the dawn of the 5th, the Japanese forces, under the cover of artillery fire, launched attacks on Yixi from both Zhuxiang and Shibei. The Chinese army fiercely resisted, and the battle lasted until 4 PM. Yixi was briefly lost but was subsequently recaptured through counterattacks from multiple routes, engaging in hand-to-hand combat until 8 PM. Zhuxiang and Shibei were also captured. The Japanese suffered heavy losses. On the Southern front, the Japanese forces trapped on Qionghai (Hainan) Island and in Wenchang have been under constant attack by the Chinese forces in recent days, resulting in numerous Japanese deaths. The remaining Japanese forces in the city are now retreating to Haikou. The Japanese forces at the two strongholds of Donggu Tan and Niujiao Tang in the county are also tightly surrounded by the Chinese forces and are attempting to escape.

Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Fronts: In Jiangnan, after the county seat of Yixing was recaptured by the Chinese forces on the 21st of last month, the remaining Japanese forces retreated towards Heqiao and Caoqiao. This week, two thousand reinforcements were sent from the Shanghai-Hangzhou area to launch a large-scale counterattack and launched multiple attacks, resulting in fierce battles. Heqiao has now also been captured by the Chinese forces, who are advancing towards Liyang, where fierce battles are taking place. The Japanese forces trapped near Zha Port in Pudong were besieged by the Chinese army on the 4th, resulting in the killing of hundreds of soldiers. The remaining Japanese forces are wavering. In Wukang and Yuhang in western Zhejiang, more than 1,800 Japanese troops have been fiercely attacking Changsu and Yangjiatou for days, engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese army. The Japanese have not succeeded so far. Another unit of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese forces in Zhapu, recapturing the area and surrounding Pinghu, advancing towards Jiaxing and Xie Shi, and completely controlling the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway. In Guichi in southern Anhui, the Japanese forces launched a fierce attack towards Beishan in the east. On the morning of the 2nd, the area was briefly lost but was recaptured by a sudden counterattack by the Chinese forces at noon, forcing the Japanese to retreat. Continuous mopping-up operations have completely recovered all the strongholds near Guichi, including Sihailing, Pingdingshan, and Lanshan, and are now advancing towards Yin Jia Hui. Shuang Gou He and Liu Ji in northern Anhui were also captured by the Chinese forces on the evening of the 1st, forcing the remaining Japanese forces to retreat towards Huaiyuan.

In addition, Ke'anbei in western Suiyuan and Elu Humm and Chou Sih Hao were captured, as well as Ma Mier and Nan Bao Guan Jing near Baotou. In southern Hebei, Heng Ru Zan Huang besieged Ji County. In northern Shandong, Li Jin was captured, Heng Tai was besieged, and Xia Jin was pressured, resulting in the death of many Japanese officers, including Senior Officer Nakamura. In northern Hunan, Xinkai Tang near Yueyang was briefly captured, and the Japanese transportation between Linxiang and Yueyang was cut off. There were also attacks on the county seats of Jing'an, Xin Jian, and Wu Ning, resulting in numerous casualties. On the 4th, Japanese aircraft in the skies near Chengdu were severely attacked by our heroic air force, and Commander Okuda of the Japanese Naval Air Force was killed. These are all important achievements of the past week and are reported here as an addendum. (9th dispatch)

### Jiangyin Puppet Bureau Chief Chen Zubei Arrested; Insatiable Greed and Accumulated Wealth

Jiangyin Correspondence: Chen Zubei, a native of Jiangyin, residing in Qiaoqi Town, served as the chairman of the puppet self-government association when Jiangyin fell. Through his extortionist methods, he accumulated considerable wealth and also ran a hotel in Wuxi. Chen's greed was insatiable, and he also served as the puppet director of the Opium Prohibition Bureau and the puppet director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, using the alias Chen Yi. Recently, he also joined the staff of the puppet Land Tax Collection Office, assisting the Japanese and puppet authorities in planning the collection of land taxes. He even volunteered to entice the guerrillas Tao Heshang and Lu Erkang and others in the Sanguan and Shuangpai villages east of the city to not obstruct the tax collection. However, Lu and others refused, and Chen was arrested by soldiers of the Xu unit and handed over to County Magistrate Zhang Pinquan for interrogation and handling.

### Kunshan Guerrillas Capture Puppet Police Chief Li Hanliang, Retribution for Evil Deeds

Li Hanliang, the puppet police chief of Zhangpu Township in Kunshan, had previously served as a staff member in the second section of the county government. Since assuming his puppet position, he had acted arbitrarily, levying exorbitant taxes and levies, causing the villagers to hate him to the bone. Last month, a large detachment of guerrillas suddenly arrived in the town, capturing Li and his follower, Cheng, and taking them to the nearby countryside, where Cheng was immediately executed, greatly pleasing the people. Li's whereabouts have been unknown for a month. It is said that the puppet county government has appointed Pan Chen to replace him.

### Puppet Provincial Government to Issue Copper Coin Notes, Orders Each County to Pay and Receive

Suzhou Correspondence: Since the spring of this year, taking advantage of the rise in the value of copper coins and copper fractional currency, the puppet government has absorbed copper coins from various occupied counties, resulting in a shortage of auxiliary currency for circulation. The puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government, feeling the lack of funds, took the opportunity to conduct extortion. At the beginning of last month, it joined the puppet governments of Zhejiang and Anhui to issue puppet copper coin notes, approved by the puppet Ministry of Finance. It is said that they will be issued soon. Before the issuance, shops in each county are forced to recall and destroy the vouchers issued, and then each county and industry must prepare funds to receive the puppet copper coin notes for general use. It is said that the county chamber of commerce here has received the puppet order, and the number of notes to be received is estimated to be around 50,000 yuan. Other counties will be subject to forced distribution based on their commercial situation.

### Shanghai: A Glimpse of Talent Supply and Demand Two Years After the War (II) Pan Wen'an, Zheng Wenhan, Shen Guanglie

Most job seekers are young, which is very clear from Table 2. Combining men and women, 81% are aged between 15 and 30. Separately, the largest group is between 21 and 25, which is roughly similar to the situation a year after the war. However, among women, the age of job seekers is gradually increasing to over 20, indicating an increasing trend of married women pursuing careers. There is also an increasing trend of young people aged 15 to 20, who, due to economic difficulties, are forced to leave school and struggle in society during their educational years. There are still quite a few adults seeking employment, an increase of 1% compared to the previous year.

Age Classification of Job Seekers (Table 2) The educational level of job seekers is concentrated among young people who have graduated from or attended secondary schools, accounting for 51.7% of the total. The next largest group is job seekers with vocational school or primary school education, accounting for 23.8%. The smallest group is job seekers with higher education, accounting for 14.9%. Compared with the previous year, there is an increasing trend in job seekers with primary school education, while there has been a significant decrease in those with university education. The reason is that there is an urgent need for talents with university and specialized education in the inland areas, and there has been a significant increase in those serving in the rear. Very few illiterate job seekers register at the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center, so this statistic can only represent the general situation of educated job seekers.

### Attempts to Obstruct the Import of Legal Tender Fail: False Supervisor's Conspiracy Foiled, Claiming the Intention Was to Manage, Not Prohibit; Foreign Exchange Rates Ease and Legal Tender Value Rises for Several Days

After Li Jiannan, the "Supervisor of the Jianghai Customs," attempted to obstruct the import of Chinese legal tender, consuls from various countries and foreign banks firmly opposed it and ignored him. The supervisor then proposed to manage the transportation of legal tender, claiming it was due to legitimate needs, stating that importing legal tender should require his prior permission. However, foreign banks also decided to ignore this so-called "management." As for Luo, the Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, he never issued an order to prohibit or manage it. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that "the supervisor's" attempt to obstruct the import of legal tender was aimed at promoting his "Huaxing Notes." The so-called management was also a method of obstruction because the "Huaxing Notes" claimed to be pegged to the British pound at a rate of sixpence. Therefore, the exchange rate announced daily by one of the tax collection offices of the Jianghai Customs showed the "Huaxing Notes" to be higher than the legal tender. Now, because the Shanghai foreign exchange black market has eased, the British pound is close to sixpence, and the price of legal tender will be higher than the "Huaxing Notes," causing a great blow to the "Huaxing Notes." Therefore, he attempted to obstruct legal tender to promote fluctuations in the foreign exchange black market and used the prevention of legal tender inflation as a pretext. In reality, the issuance of Chinese legal tender has always been cautious, and cash reserves remain sufficient. The government has never resorted to paper money policies, and there is no inflation.

The "North China Daily News" reported that yesterday (the 9th), it was heard from responsible sources that Li Jiannan, the customs supervisor recently appointed by the "new government," sent a letter to the consuls of the Shanghai Consular Body, which did not mention "prohibiting" the import and export of banknotes from Chinese banks but aimed at "controlling the monetary actions of banks." The Consular Body has not yet responded to Li's letter.

Not Obstructing the Import of Legal Tender

Li Jiannan recently told reporters that there had been a misunderstanding regarding the news of his letter to the consuls, which he deeply regretted. His purpose was not to prohibit the import and export of legal tender but only to control the banks and allow them the monetary actions of foreign banks transporting large amounts of legal tender to Shanghai. Banks engaged in transporting currency to Shanghai could achieve their goals if they first applied to him for "permission."

So-called Appropriate Utilization

Furthermore, if the imported legal tender is put to appropriate use, permission will be granted. This matter is mostly related to foreign banks because Chinese banks have not transported amounts of legal tender to Shanghai large enough to attract his attention. The original intent of this order was to seek the "welfare of the Shanghai market and trade," as too many banknotes would cause "inflation," he said. When asked by reporters if there were any difficulties in implementing control, Li replied that this was another question.

The Rumor of Control is Also Inaccurate

The "Shanghai Times" reported that Li Jiannan firmly denied yesterday that the "Reformed Government" had prohibited the import and export of legal tender in Shanghai, and said that the rumor that the customs authorities are now taking a method of controlling currency is not accurate. The regulations issued do not prohibit the import and export of legal tender but broadly state that the actions of currency must be controlled. Therefore, what is now being taken is a method of control, not prohibition.

The Puppet Regime's Purpose is to Apply First

Last year, there were various unrestricted actions of importing and exporting silver. Now, large amounts of banknotes are being transferred, mostly transported in and out of Hong Kong. In his letter to the consular leader, he outlined the regulations that must be followed and explained that the secret transportation of legal tender is not allowed. Whether Chinese or foreign banks wish to import or export legal tender for commercial purposes, they must first apply for permission from the "Customs Supervisor." The banks must prove that this legal tender is for their own business operations. If the "Customs" considers that the regulations have been followed and that the funds are not used for market speculation, permission will be granted.

Chase Bank's Banknotes Were Never Detained

The letter to the consuls was written in Chinese and dated October 4th, urging the banks to comply with the regulations for the benefit of themselves and the Shanghai market and trade. In response to the matter of the President Pierce's ship carrying approximately 10 million yuan of banknotes last week being briefly detained, Li said that Chase Bank had applied for permission to import these banknotes when they were first transported. The customs opened the boxes for inspection when the legal tender arrived at the customs dock and eventually passed them through.

### Parallel Talks in Tokyo and Shanghai: Japan Says Its Wishes Are Difficult to Fulfill Because All Countries Reject the "New Order in East Asia"; The Powers Will Never Risk Committing a Great Wrong

Japanese diplomat Koki Hirota arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 8th, intending to hold talks parallel to those in Tokyo with the American Consul General in Shanghai, Clarence Gauss, and diplomatic representatives of third countries, and will travel to Nanjing, Hankou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other places. According to diplomatic sources, such talks may not be held in the short term because since the

German-Soviet Pact

was signed, Japanese diplomacy has become isolated. Japan is constantly thinking of holding talks with the major powers such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to improve relations with various countries, but the "New Order in East Asia" it has advocated has been rejected by various countries. Therefore, although there has been contact with Britain and the United States, it has

Failed to Convene

a formal meeting. Currently, although Britain has a tendency to compromise with Japan, the United States, a supporter of Britain, has repeatedly stated that it must maintain the Nine-Power Treaty and uphold China's sovereignty, independence, integrity, and the principles of equal opportunity and the open door policy, and will not allow Japan to

Wantonly Destroy Them

If the Japanese side attempts to implement small favors to induce Britain and the United States to recognize the puppet "central regime," and the United States has already opposed it, then Britain is unlikely to risk committing this great wrong and recognize it later. Therefore, how Hirota can convene talks parallel to those in Tokyo in Shanghai is not only hesitant but also difficult to fulfill his wishes. As for the Shanghai conference not being able to be convened immediately, Hirota had already explained it to reporters from Japanese newspapers the day before yesterday.

### Today is Armistice Day in Europe: Polish People Celebrate National Day; Polish People Hold a Determined Resolve to Restore Their Country Without the Slightest Weakening; Commemoration of the European Armistice is Simpler Than in Previous Years

Polish People All Over the World Celebrate National Day

November 11th is Armistice Day of the World War, which is also Poland's National Day. After being ruled by foreign countries for 150 years, Poland regained its independence on November 11, 1918. Polish people all over the world will celebrate National Day tomorrow (the 11th). According to news from the Polish Consulate, the

Polish Embassy

will hold a reception tomorrow from 11:30 to 12:30, and has invited Polish expatriates and diplomatic personnel from various countries to attend. In addition, there are various other activities. Historically, Poland occupied an important position in Eastern European politics for 800 years from 902 to 1795. It was then subjected to

Three Partitions

by powerful neighbors in 1772, etc. During the World War from 1914 to 1918, after Germany and Austria suffered defeats, Poland declared its independence on November 11, 1919. On this day, the late General Pilsudski formally notified various countries of the existence of the Polish nation. In the subsequent 21 years, Poland made progress in all aspects and was

Recognized by Various Countries

In September of this year, Germany invaded Poland and occupied its territory. Poland has to fight again to resist aggression. Now that the Allied countries are assisting in the military to restore the Polish nation, Poland can be expected to rise again and be even stronger.

The Situation of the European Armistice Commemoration is Bleak

Today is the "Armistice and Peace Memorial" day of the First World War. The British expatriates in Shanghai, in order to commemorate the souls of the martyrs who died on the battlefield, will still hold a memorial ceremony as usual this year, but it is only slightly simpler due to the extraordinary times. At 8:30 this morning, Mr. Atkins, Chairman of the British Victory League, will lead the presentation of a wreath made of poppy flowers to the

Goddess of Peace

on the Bund. Members of the association or British expatriates who wish to participate can wait in front of the Goddess of Peace before 8:20 this morning, wearing medals or awards, to hold the ceremony. This year is also quite simple. At 10:45 a.m., a meeting will be held at the British Church at 219 Jiujiang Road, and Reverend Chadwick will

Preside Over the Ceremony

At 11:00 a.m., everyone will stand in silence for three minutes to mourn the war dead, and then two songs will be played, followed by the wind music of the 1st Battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders. The association welcomes British expatriates who wish to participate, but seats will not be reserved. Those who participate in the ceremony must donate a small amount of money to supplement the insufficient funds of the British Victory League.

British Veterans

usually hold a luncheon, but this year it has been decided to cancel it. In previous years today, there were public sales of poppy flowers on the streets and alleys to show peace, but this year it has also been decided to stop selling them. However, if foreign expatriates need this flower for personal use or to give to friends, they can request it from the association for free. The association also provides wreaths decorated on cars and tables, but when requesting them,

Contribute a Small Amount of Money

to help the families of those who sacrificed in the last war living in Shanghai. It is heard that these poppy wreaths are ordered from London flower gardens, and their value is very high due to exchange rates. However, British expatriates in Shanghai will enthusiastically donate because the donations are used for charitable expenses. The British Victory League authorities notified all British expatriates in Shanghai to wear fresh flowers all day to the greatest extent possible to

Commemorate the Glorious War Dead

The soldiers of the 4th Regiment of the US Marine Corps, the commanders of the British Army stationed in Shanghai, and Mrs. Whipple, Chairman of the American Women's Association, are all scheduled to lay flowers in front of the Martyrs' Memorial at 11:00 a.m. today to hold a memorial ceremony.

### Japanese Sentries in Zhabei Withdraw Again; No Japanese Soldiers Patrol the Northern District of Suzhou Creek Either

The Japanese army's positions stationed in the suburbs of Shanghai have recently withdrawn in many places. In addition to several withdrawals in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, they also withdrew from many positions in Zhabei yesterday. It is reported that there were two Japanese soldiers stationed at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Boundary Road, but one of them was withdrawn yesterday. There were also two Japanese sentries in the weeds west of the barbed wire on North Tibet Road, but now there is only one left. There was a Japanese soldier stationed on the abandoned fortress diagonally opposite the fire station on Wuzhen Road and Xinmin Road, but he was also gone yesterday. The Northern District of Suzhou Creek used to be patrolled by armed Japanese soldiers from time to time, and barbed wire was repaired, but it has not been seen for many days. Near the North Station, Japanese soldiers used to stroll on the road from time to time, but now they are no longer seen.

### The Second Batch of Fractional Currency Notes Have Been Printed: Scheduled for Issuance Next Week; All Industries Feel the Need and It Is Difficult to Distribute; It Is Proposed That Each Firm Exchange 20 Yuan

After the Central Bank issued one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes, the first batch has been completely issued. The second batch of 500,000 yuan (including 200,000 yuan in one-cent notes and 300,000 yuan in five-cent notes) was entrusted to the American company, Wing On Company, to print. It has completed the printing in batches and delivered it to the Central Bank in accordance with the contract. The bank has scheduled to continue issuing it starting next week. However, the issuance method is to entrust it to the trade associations of various industries for distribution. The general regulation is that each member firm of the association can exchange 20 yuan of fractional currency notes, with the aim of widespread circulation and preventing large amounts from flowing into the occupied areas. It is heard that the Shanghai trade associations have been registering the number of requests from members with the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, amounting to no less than one hundred. The number applied for ranges from tens of thousands of yuan for the largest to thousands of yuan for the smallest. After receiving the letters, the Central Bank, because the 500,000 yuan of the second printing is really insufficient to meet the demand, yesterday specially replied to the trade associations, reducing the number of fractional currency notes registered for collection. The original letter said: "Respectfully, we have received your letter and learned that fractional currency notes are used for making change, and all industries feel the need. If all are exchanged in large quantities, our office will find it difficult to distribute. Regarding the request of your association's members to exchange fractional notes, we will consider allocating them at the appropriate time." After receiving the replies, the trade associations have also sent letters to their respective members, stating that they should not go to the trade association to apply before the Central Bank officially announces the date for collecting fractional currency notes, to avoid repeated trips.

### The Puppet Police Bureau in West Shanghai Obstructs Concession Police Affairs, Using Non-Cooperation as a Passive Means, Refusing Assistance in Police Searches

The "North China Daily News" reported that crimes and illegal activities have been recurring from Yangshupu to Jessfield Road in Shanghai. The Public Concession and French Concession police departments are facing extreme difficulties in detecting criminals. It is allowed that the extra-territorial area of ​​West Shanghai, outside the Public Concession authorities, has become the place of occurrence of major crimes, and a place where some of the most vicious gangs hide and hoard weapons.

Difficulties in Arresting and Searching for Stolen Goods

Yesterday (9th), the reporter learned that the "Special Municipal Government" has given very little or no cooperation to the Public Concession Police Department in pursuing gangs or criminals hiding in the extra-territorial road areas. Therefore, although the police department knows the location of the wanted criminals, it often cannot arrest them or recover the stolen goods.

Robbery of a Money Shop on Seward Road

On the evening of October 16, eleven Chinese, half of whom were carrying handguns, robbed the Juru Money Shop at 84 Seward Road within the Japanese military defense zone of 135,000 yuan. The Public Concession Police Department soon arrested several suspects in the Wayside district, some of whom admitted to participating in the robbery. The police department also recovered a portion of the robbed funds in the Zhabei district. After questioning by detectives, some criminals confessed that there was another 8,000 yuan of the robbed funds hidden in several houses in the Jessfield district.

Failure to Cooperate in Going to Search

It is heard that in order to confirm the criminals' confession, the police department has requested the assistance of the Japanese authorities in searching the hiding place of the funds. The Japanese military has handed this matter over to the "Special Municipal Government" police bureau for handling, but the police bureau has not provided the necessary assistance. According to several members of the police department, the police department assists other police organizations, including the "Special Municipal Government" police bureau, without hesitation. However, the "police bureau" rarely or does not cooperate with the police department, so that criminals hiding in or coming from the bad land of the Western District can be brought to justice.

### Sergeant Major Katsunori Tamai's Sincere Words: Guangzhou is Actually Besieged, and Japanese Casualties Are Increasing

The "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" quoted a Tokyo dispatch from the Domei News Agency on the 10th, saying that Japanese modern writer Sergeant Major Katsunori Tamai, pen name Heihei Hino, served in the Japanese Army and recently completed his term. He returned to Japan on Tuesday and wrote an article published in the Asahi Shimbun-related newspapers today.

Warning Japan

Do not think that the war in China is almost won. Although the Japanese army has occupied cities such as Guangzhou, Japan's mission in China is not over. The actual situation in and around Guangzhou is very

Different From What Is Believed

in Japan. Japanese soldiers are still experiencing many difficulties. The Japanese people think that the war is over and the Japanese soldiers are enjoying themselves, but in fact, the Japanese soldiers are still very active. Even at present, the enemy is still moving around Guangzhou. They are not small guerrilla units but tens of thousands of

Regular Troops

holding strong trenches. They are constantly paying attention to the opportunity to recover Guangzhou. Japanese outposts are attacked by them almost every day. They take advantage of their familiarity with the terrain and take the offensive at night. When attacked, they disperse like flies, but quickly return and fight again. The number of

Japanese Casualties

during the landing at Daya Bay and the conquest of Guangzhou was far less than the number of Japanese soldiers killed and wounded in the successive battles after the city was occupied. Although the enemy suffered heavier casualties, the Japanese army could not be without losses in many fierce battles. It is reported that the three books "Wheat and Soldiers," "Mud and Soldiers," and "Flowers and Soldiers" written by Sergeant Major Katsunori Tamai are widely sold.

### The Shooting at Wanli Restaurant: Guests Arrested for Investigation – Seventeen guests were arrested after the shooting and temporarily detained for investigation.

Yang Jinhai from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 22 Xinle Village, Xinjiapo Road, was of humble origin. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, he joined a certain side to assist in their work and repeatedly achieved merit, possessing great influence in the western Shanghai area. Recently, through the boasting of Luo Zhibin, a translator from the Japanese military police headquarters and a native of Jiangbei, Yang was recently appointed as the captain of the 8th Brigade of the "Shanghai West Self-Defense Corps."

A Petty Person Who Achieved Success

Was exceedingly delighted, and Luo also obtained an important position in the brigade. In order to flaunt their newly acquired official positions, the two of them held a banquet at 7 PM the night before in rooms 22 and 23 of the Wanli Restaurant on Fuzhou Road, inviting their cronies and friends. Their intention in choosing this restaurant was to take advantage of the auspicious "Wanli" (ten thousand profits) name. A total of five tables were set up that day, with more than 40 guests attending. At 7:20 PM, just as the banquet was underway and everyone was enjoying themselves, three uninvited guests suddenly rushed in. Upon reaching the table, they each took out their handguns,

including Mauser pistols

And other weapons and fired more than ten shots continuously at the hosts, Yang Jinhai and Luo Zhibin. Yang was hit by a total of ten bullets, all in vital areas, and immediately fell to the ground dead. Luo was initially hit in the forehead by one bullet and fell. The assassins then added another shot to his back, causing him to die immediately as well. Although the assassins were in a hasty and panicked state, their bullets all concentrated on Yang and Luo, and none of the other people at the table were injured.

After the Incident

The Lao Zha (old gate) Police Station immediately received a report and detectives Zhang Keqin, Li Pengfei, and Huang Cifu rushed to the scene to make arrests. However, the assassins had already calmly fled, and most of the guests at the table with the two dead men scattered amidst the chaos. Those who remained were Pan Yasheng (an employee of the Japanese military police department) from Shanghai, Zhou Xilian, Yang Jinxi and Yang Shanfu from Zhenjiang, Yang Ganquan from Jiangbei, Zhang Jibin from Shanghai, Gui Qing, Wang Mingtang, Ji Dequan, He Yutang, Mi Henglong, and Wang Guanhua from Yangzhou, Zhu Daozhang and Zhang Chengzhi from Anhui, and Su Chengzhi, Li Zhuqing, and Zhou Gongzhao, totaling seventeen people. The detectives

Recovered Shell Casings

Twelve shell casings and five bullets from the scene. In addition to transporting the bodies of the two deceased to the coroner's office for examination, the seventeen remaining guests were considered suspects and subject to investigation. They were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 District Court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao, briefly explained the circumstances, stating that the seventeen suspects obtained were all related to this incident and required further investigation. If it was determined that they were not involved, the court was requested to release them. Currently, a petition was being made to

Approve Detention

For one week. According to rumors, this tragic event occurred entirely due to internal strife among Yang Jinhai and his associates. It is said that the newly appointed "Self-Defense Corps Captain" was originally a lucrative position, leading to fierce competition among various parties beforehand. Yang's appointment to this position was also due to the assistance of others, but once he obtained the position, he disregarded them. Unexpectedly, a tragic incident occurred at the celebration banquet, so the aforementioned possibility may not be without its basis.

### Statistics of Criminals Arrested at Bund Wharves

From October 1st to October 31st, a total of 881,571 people were inspected at the wharves along the Bund. Now, the number of criminals arrested this month is compared with the number arrested in September in the table below.

### Incidents of Robbery Also Recorded

At approximately 7:20 PM yesterday, more than ten bandits suddenly broke into a certain house at No. 300, Aidooah Road, for robbery. Five of the bandits, wielding handguns, restrained all the people in the house. Other bandits took the opportunity to search each room, overturning boxes and ransacking everything. As a result, the stolen cash and belongings amounted to more than 2,500 yuan before they escaped. The victim reported the incident to the police station, who are investigating the case.

At 8 PM last night, four or five bandits rushed to a certain Zhuang residence at house numbers four and five within No. 480, Meibaige Road. Only one bandit was armed with a firearm and confined the people in the house to one room. As a result, the bandits robbed property worth more than 600 yuan and escaped. The victim has reported the incident to the police station, requesting an investigation.

### British Aircraft Forced to Land in the South China Sea – Japanese Side Strongly Explains – Claims Violation of Anti-Japanese Naval Declaration – Two Pilots Still Detained for Interrogation

At 9:30 AM on the 8th, the British Imperial Airways civilian aircraft "Datanus" heading from Hong Kong to Bangkok,

was forced to land by Japanese military aircraft while passing Zhou Island. Last night, the spokesperson of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai stated at a press briefing that the aircraft

Was forced to land because it flew into a prohibited area. At 9:30 AM that day, a Japanese military aircraft spotted the "Datanus" flying at an altitude of 670 feet, 5 miles away from Zhou Island. The action was taken because it was considered a violation of the Japanese naval authorities' declaration issued in February of this year,

And it forced the landing on the beach of Zhou Island. Aside from the damage to the left tire, the aircraft sustained no other losses. A total of five people were on board the aircraft. The Japanese military used a naval aircraft yesterday to transport three of the passengers to Guangzhou. The three passengers, one Norwegian, one American, and one Iranian, were all handed over to the

British consulate in Guangzhou. The two British pilots, Mr. Wilson (30 years old) and Mr. Rebhorn (25 years old), are still being detained for interrogation. The aircraft will be returned to British Airways after it is repaired. The Japanese navy's declaration that the aircraft violated was issued on the 2nd of this month by the Japanese Consul-General in Guangzhou, advising all countries' aircraft not to fly within a 15-mile radius of Zhou Island and not to fly at an altitude below 1,700 feet.

### Jewish Refugees – Set Up a Court Without Authorization – Do Not Apply Chinese Law – Cai Xiaobai Writes to the Public Concession Requesting Thorough Investigation

Most nations that treat our people with equality automatically abolish consular jurisdiction, demonstrating respect for our country's judiciary. Our country's government and people respect the rights and interests of foreigners even more. Even for stateless White Russian and Jewish refugees, our country has never harmed their legal rights and interests. Unexpectedly, Jewish refugees have recently followed in the footsteps of the great powers, undermining our country's legal authority by setting up a court in eastern Shanghai without authorization. Their judgments do not apply Chinese law. Mr. Cai Xiaobai, a lawyer in this city, specifically submitted a letter to the Lawyers Association yesterday, requesting a thorough investigation. The original text of lawyer Cai's letter to the Lawyers Association is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, I have learned that Jewish refugees, who were expelled from Germany and came to Shanghai, have recently organized a conciliation court without authorization at No. 66 Aierkaoke Road in eastern Shanghai. They have already begun handling cases and have established 15 articles of court regulations (full text attached). The main points are translated as follows: (1) Jewish people are prohibited from filing lawsuits in Chinese courts; otherwise, they will be punished. (2) Conciliation fees will be charged. (3) Lawyers registered with the court are allowed to appear in court. (4) Judgments do not apply Chinese law. (5) Judges and staff are formally appointed and receive salaries. This organization not only despises our country's courts but also undermines law and order. I specifically suggest that a thorough investigation and prevention should be conducted immediately. Sincerely, Member Cai Xiaobai," It is also known that the false court is currently scheduled to hear cases every Monday and Friday from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. If the amount involved in a financial dispute is more than 500 yuan, a lawyer registered with the false court must be hired to appear in court.

### Middle School for Refugee Children – Forced to Dissolve – Students Have Been Sent to – Various Shelters for Temporary Residence

The Elementary Middle School for Refugee Children in this city was established with the assistance of charitable organizations. After two years of operation, it has achieved considerable success. Many students have advanced to higher education and entered the workforce. The school was originally located in Xuyuan on Kang'naotu Road. After suffering a fire this spring, it was able to restore its former appearance thanks to the relief from charitable organizations. This semester, it received subsidies from charitable groups again and built two thatched huts on the open space behind the Sheng Clan Ancestral Hall at No. 11 Jisi Fei Road to serve as school buildings, in order to expand its scope and benefit refugee students. Unexpectedly, less than two weeks after moving in, Japanese and puppet troops and police invaded the area to build roads across the border, suddenly occupying a portion of the Sheng residence. As a result, the school's environment deteriorated. The residence was originally borrowed by the Cilian Branch, which established the 31st Refugee Shelter there. In the middle of last month, all the refugees were forcibly expelled by the Japanese and puppet forces. The school is now facing the same fate, being forced to move out. It had no choice but to temporarily distribute all the students to the Cilian Branch's Third San, 34th, and 58th Refugee Shelters for temporary accommodation, while awaiting further relief methods to be determined by charitable organizations.

### Japanese Army Dispatches Fujita Susumu – To Serve as Commander

Shanghai, 10th (Domei News Agency) – In order to cope with the situation and handle the China Incident, the Japanese military authorities have organized the General Headquarters of the China Expeditionary Force and are steadily implementing military plans. Recently, Lieutenant General Fujita Susumu was appointed to take over from Lieutenant General Tanaka, who was the commander in the area centered on Shanghai. When the incident occurred, Fujita was under the command of General Matsui Iwane.

### Release of Portuguese Vessels – Another Organization Involved – Rumor that Fada of De. is Registered with the Puppet Regime – Far East Company Officially Denies

The seven Portuguese vessels were suddenly released on the 4th of this month. The companies have not actually taken over them, so the truth is unclear. It is rumored that someone impersonated the shipowner to register with the puppet organization first and then negotiated with the Japanese Navy to obtain the release. As for the Portuguese merchant Far East Company's ship "Fada", the rumor says that it was also registered with the puppet regime before being released. Yesterday, the company officially announced a denial, denying that "Fada" was registered with the puppet regime. As for the release, it was not involved at all. It is believed that there is another organization involved in the release of the Portuguese vessels this time.

### English Crowford Company – Ship Rentals – Negotiations for Shanghai Agent – Business Is Increasingly Prosperous

Since the fall of Guangzhou and Shantou, various shipping companies have opened new routes to Haiphong, Saigon, and other places, and transportation has been flourishing. Later, due to the European incident, foreign exchange became extremely tight, and Hong Kong dollars were changed to Hong Kong dollars. However, various irregular shipping companies still calculated in national currency, and Hakka naturally changed to irregular ships. Therefore, the profits of various irregular shipping companies have multiplied, and they have been renting ships to operate. Recently, it has been heard that the Shanghai branch of Qiacheng Shipping Company at No. 12 Fada Road has been managing various shipping lines to the North and South Seas, and its business is developing rapidly. Now, it has also been entrusted by the London Crowford Company (transliteration) to act as an agent for the rental of the company's ships. Many large and small ships, such as the Baoweike, Guangji, and Liji, have been leased by the company and sailed because the business is becoming more and more prosperous. It has established branches in Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, India, and other places to facilitate communication.

### Reverend Kang Wen Dies from Injuries Sustained in Shooting by Japanese Sentries in Xuzhou – Reverend Fang Tai'en's Injuries Have Not Yet Healed – Another Reverend Fortunate to Escape

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," a message from Xuzhou, northern Jiangsu Province, today (10th) states that of the two Canadian Jesuit priests who were shot and injured by Japanese sentries in Yaolou, near Xuzhou, on the 28th of this month, one, Reverend Kang Wen, has died from his injuries. His companion, Reverend Fang Tai'en, is still being cared for by doctors. According to Reverend Kang, Reverend Fang, and another reverend, the three were riding bicycles towards Xuzhou after midday that day. When they passed Yaolou, ten miles outside the city, they were shot at by Japanese sentries. Reverend Kang Wen was the first to fall, followed by Reverend Fang Tai'en. The third reverend was alert and threw himself to the ground, thus avoiding possible injury or death. After firing the shots, the Japanese sentries ran towards the injured men. It is said that when they recognized the injured men as foreign priests, they provided first aid and then summoned a doctor to treat them. At the time, the three reverends were wearing black Chinese clothing and white hats, and they were traveling very fast. The Japanese sentries ordered them to stop from 140 yards away, but when the order was not obeyed, they fired.

### Woman Dies from Poisoning After Sniffing White Powder – Drug Dealer and Family Settle Death Privately – Hospital Conceals Report and Is Also Implicated – Police Investigate and Inspect Coffin Yesterday

Chen A'gen, a resident of Shanghai, from Ningbo, nicknamed "Carpenter A'gen," residing at No. 39 Pi Shaonai Road outside Xiaobeimen, French Concession, is 30 years old this year and has been selling heroin and morphine for a living. He used to purchase from Chen Lin, a young woman from Chaozhou (25 years old this year) residing at No. 4, Lane 94, Aidooah Road, British Concession, but then suddenly started purchasing from elsewhere. On the afternoon of the 19th of last month, Chen Lin went to Chen A'gen's house to collect the remaining 50 yuan owed for the goods and blamed him for

Being A Longtime Customer

And not buying from her anymore. Chen A'gen replied that her goods were of inferior quality and difficult to sell, unlike the high-quality goods from elsewhere, which were easier to sell. He took out a package of white powder to show Lin, asking her to judge the quality. Lin accepted it, opened the package, and brought it to her nose to smell it. Unexpectedly, during inhalation, the poisonous powder flew into her nasal passages and directly into her brain, causing her to be poisoned. She immediately fainted and lost consciousness. Chen A'gen was greatly alarmed when he saw this and immediately sprayed her with clean water for

Unsuccessful First Aid

Then ordered his friend, Xiao Yongshou, who was also from his hometown, to rush to notify her brother, Lin Zaokun, to come. They delayed until 6 AM the next morning, when they hired a car to take Chen Lin to the Chaozhou Heji Hospital in Hong'anfang, Luban Road, for treatment. Doctor Shen Dingyang diagnosed her and gave her two doses of a heart stimulant, but they were still unable to save her. She soon died. Later, the Heji Hospital, due to accepting bribes, deliberately concealed the incident and did not report it to the police station. Chen A'gen, on the other hand, enlisted people to mediate with the deceased's family, compensating them with several hundred yuan for the loss,

And Settled Privately

The matter was settled. The family prepared a coffin and collected the body, which was placed in a room for storage. The matter has passed. Now, French Concession detectives Dai Rongji and Ni Jinrong have investigated and found that Chen and others had settled a major death case privately, and that Heji Hospital had accepted bribes and concealed the incident, violating regulations. They arrested Chen A'gen, Lin Zaokun, Xiao Yongshou, and Hu Xianrong (manager of the Heji Hospital accounting office) one after another, and first escorted them to the Special No. 2 District Court, requesting

Detention for Investigation

Before prosecution. At the same time, they tracked down the location of the body and coffin. After three days of investigation, they finally learned that the body and coffin were stored in the Tonghai Coffin Storage Office on Daxi Road. When they went to investigate, the office refused to acknowledge it, denying that they had received and stored the coffin. They then arrested Wang, the accountant of the office, for questioning, and he admitted that they had received and stored it. Yesterday morning, they transported the body and coffin to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Coroner's Office and reported to the prosecutor of the Special No. 2 District Court, who, accompanied by a forensic doctor, arrived at the office at noon to open the coffin and examine the body. The result of the identification was that Chen Lin

Died from Poisoning

The police also sent the arrested Chen Lin, Xiao Hu, and four other criminals, along with doctor Shen Dingyang, to the case. After the prosecutor questioned them in detail, he ordered the body to be handed over to Lin Zaokun for collection. The police department is investigating and verifying the concealment of the body and the cause of death.

### Social Miscellany

Surrounding and Searching the Dongfang Hotel

Recently, terrorist incidents have continued to occur in the concessions. Therefore, the police authorities of the two concessions have strengthened their prevention measures. At 9 PM on the 9th, the Public Concession, based on confidential information, dispatched more than a dozen members of the reserve team, two red police cars, and more than fifty British soldiers to surround the Dongfang Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road and conduct a large-scale search, prohibiting travelers from entering or exiting. After half an hour, they found nothing and lifted the emergency alert.

Robber Gang of Tossed Hats (Toss Top Hats) Swept Away

As the weather gradually turns colder, the hat-snatching thieves (commonly known as "Toss Top Hats") have risen. The French Concession Police Department believes that these illegal elements affect public safety, so they have ordered the detectives to strictly arrest them during this winter prevention period in order to ensure the safety of travelers. It is learned that after the police department's efforts to investigate and arrest them, more than sixty hat-snatching thieves were arrested on one day yesterday, sweeping them away. According to their confessions, more than two hundred stolen hats were retrieved from various pawnshops and used-goods stalls. The police department is now eagerly hoping that citizens who have had their hats stolen will contact the Foreign Affairs Section of the French Concession Police Department at No. 22 Xuehua 6th Road.

Thirty Robbers Sentenced to Various Terms of Imprisonment

General Police Department detectives Feng Qishan and Zhao Lianbi recently arrested a large number of male and female robbers at No. 135 Annakin Road and No. 82, Lane 327, Parker Road, including 34 people such as Fan Zhengchu. They seized three handguns, two fake handguns, fifteen bullets, and one knife. It was found that these individuals had repeatedly committed armed robbery cases in the concession, no less than twenty cases before and after.

Decline in Foreign Exchange Buying, US-British Exchange Rates Drop for Six Consecutive Days, Local Exchange Market Diverges

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The informal market for US-British exchange was quiet due to the impending holiday. Trading was mediocre and the trend was slightly loose, as the various bullish sentiments that had permeated the market yesterday and the day before had gradually dissipated. Moreover, the widespread rumors of Germany's impending invasion of the Netherlands and Hitler's war rhetoric continued to shatter any illusions of peace in Europe. Consequently, overseas US-British exchange rates contracted further, falling by more than six points (after falling for six consecutive days, a total of 1.125 points). This caused the market to open with a familiar pattern of even British and tight US dollars. Soon after, Hong Kong banks and Chinese banks began selling. Although arbitrageurs initially seized the opportunity to buy on behalf of certain parties, the rate had already loosened to 5.21875 and 8.375. Subsequently, Chinese merchants and Sassoon also joined in the buying, pushing the rate back to 5.09375 and 8.1875. However, after that, Citibank, a foreign bank, offered to sell, and arbitrageurs also considered taking profits, causing the rate to harden again to 5.21875 and 8.28125. In the afternoon, the power company came to the market to settle accounts, momentarily tightening the rate to 5.09375 and 8.125. But after lingering for a long time, foreign banks suddenly began to sell. The closing price was still stable, with British gold at 5.1875 and the US exchange rate at 8.1875 (equivalent to a US-British exchange rate of only 3.788). Compared to the previous day, British exchange was looser by 0.125, while the US dollar was tighter by 0.03125. The futures market mirrored the spot market, with active trading throughout the day.

Hong Kong Banks Lead the Selling

At the beginning of the morning, London's forward and spot rates were even, the price of silver in New York remained flat, and the price of raw gold in London was unchanged. The exchange rate for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai dollars, and French francs was flat.

The Central Bank's listed rates remained unchanged. At the opening of the bank's spot selling prices, British gold was 5.0625, and the British exchange rate was 8.125. Compared to the previous close, British was even and the US dollar tightened by 0.09375, due to the sharp decline in the exchange rate. After the opening, Hong Kong Electric led the selling, and Chinese banks also came to sell. Although arbitrageurs seized the opportunity to buy on behalf of certain parties, the position was still quite ample, so the market ended up tightening. It is estimated that Hong Kong Electric sold spot British gold to arbitrageurs, HSBC, and other foreign banks at 5.125 and 5.1875, and spot US dollars from 8.25 to 8.3125. HSBC's listed rates were announced unchanged, and the Silver Equalization Tax was also announced unchanged. Thereafter, it was shouted up to 5.2875 and 8.375. Then Sassoon suddenly bought in, and at the same time, Chinese merchants also made purchases, so the trend suddenly turned tight. It is estimated that foreign banks, Citibank, and certain banks bought in spot British gold at 5.15625 and 5.125, and spot US dollars at 8.3125 and 8.25. Later, it was called down to 5.09375 and 8.1875. Near noon, the buying wind gradually subsided, and Citibank's selling intentions suddenly intensified, and British banks and arbitrageurs also resumed selling slightly, so the situation trended towards firmness again. It is estimated that they sold spot British gold to Chinese merchants and counterparts at 5.1875 and 5.21875, and spot US dollars at 8.25 and 8.28125. Extended to the noon close, the bank's spot selling price was British gold at 5.1875, and the US dollar at 8.25. Compared to the morning opening, the British exchange was looser by 0.125, and the US dollar rebounded by 0.125.

### The Buying Wind Has Wained, Gold Market Slightly Declines

Yesterday's spot gold market conditions saw a resurgence of selling due to the sudden shift to looseness in the exchange market. Most retail longs had short-term thinking and were extremely willing to close out with thin profits at any time. Therefore, influenced by the firmness of the foreign exchange market at the morning opening, it immediately fell sharply by 50 yuan to open at 3,680 yuan. For a time, the downward trend was very strong, and the lowest level once retreated to 3,650 yuan. Because the exchange market turned soft, major Hong Kong banks bought in and certain gold firms and money changers bought in a considerable amount, rising several times to 3,720 yuan. However, shortly after, the foreign exchange rate hardened again, and at this time, silver building banks and cash firms sold with great effort, so the price could not be sustained and fell to 3,675 yuan. Fortunately, the buying intention of gold firms re-emerged, and certain silver firms also came to search for it. This was because the exchange market had turned from loose to flat. By noon, it was still 3,705 yuan. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange suddenly reported firmness, rising by 40 yuan, reaching a peak of 3,745 yuan. Before the close, the exchange market was still reported as loose and flat, coupled with retail sales, retreated to 3,717 yuan at the close. As a result, the profit was reduced by 13 yuan, and the transaction was still active, around 1,500 taels. The price of silver building jewelry was reduced by 5 yuan, and the price of customs gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Only Fell 13 Yuan

Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially weakened due to the convenience of the foreign exchange market, and the situation also tended to weaken. The market opened with a small decrease of 50 yuan, and money changers did 20 taels among themselves, at 3,680 yuan. Then, because the exchange market was still reported as loosening, and silver building banks and money changers came to sell, it fell by another 30 yuan. The money changers gave 10 taels to gold firms, at 3,650 yuan. At that time, certain silver buildings launched purchases on behalf of Hong Kong banks, and certain gold firms also searched for purchases on behalf of speculators, and at the same time, foreign exchange rebounded, and soon recovered by 70 yuan. Certain silver buildings bought 30 taels from securities banks, at 3,720 yuan. Later, securities banks and retail investors sold hard, and soon fell by 30 yuan, and money changers did 40 taels among themselves, at 3,690 yuan. After that, certain money changers suddenly bought in, aggressively buying more than 200 taels, and re-fathered the price to 3,720 yuan. Then, because the foreign exchange was re-reported as hardening, the selling trend suddenly intensified, and cash firms, money changers, and silver banks scrambled to sell, and guest banks stopped buying, so it could not be sustained and plummeted by 45 yuan. Gold firms sold 20 taels to money changers, at 3,675 yuan. Later, certain gold firms came to pull it up, and the market trend stabilized, rising by more than 10 yuan. By the time of closing, certain silver buildings and gold firms also came to fish in, and the foreign exchange had stopped loosening and turned flat, so it rose by more than 10 yuan again. Certain Yu firms bought 40 taels from securities banks, at 3,705 yuan as the noon closing price. In the early afternoon, it was strong, and the market opened 25 yuan higher, and certain silver buildings bought 20 taels from money changers, at 3,712 yuan. Subsequently, securities banks sold hard for more than 100 taels, and fell back 15 yuan. Securities banks sold 50 taels to silver building banks, at 3,715 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange was hardening, and certain securities banks also came to search for purchases, and Hong Kong banks all had purchases, so it soared again by 30 yuan, and securities banks bought 30 taels from money changers, at 3,745 yuan. After that, silver building banks seized the opportunity to hedge and sell, and certain gold firms also closed out long positions, and the foreign exchange rebounded, falling by 30 yuan, and silver building banks did 20 taels among themselves, at 3,715 yuan. After entering the market, certain money changers pulled it up, rising by 15 yuan, and money changers did 10 taels among themselves, at 3,730 yuan. Later, because retail investors sold, it fell again by 13 yuan, and money changers forked and did 20 taels among themselves, at 3,717 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell back by 3 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 95 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash firm's brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by more than 20 yuan.

As a result, major firms changed to 375 yuan, and new firms had the same price as the previous price. The purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Discount Reverted by 4 Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange suddenly saw a decline. The initial discount rate was 43 to 44 yuan per thousand yuan, falling to 40 yuan near noon, and slightly rebounding to 41 yuan in the afternoon, a reduction of 4 yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate for money industry associations still opened at 0.15 in the morning and afternoon markets, it is said.

### Foreign Currencies Hover and Soften

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw no strong demand for British and American gold pounds, and the American gold pound showed a slight firmness. British and American gold bills fell following the decline in the pound exchange rate, while demand for American gold bills was very strong, and the market remained stable. The supply of Hong Kong franc bills was also smooth, and the market was loose. Demand for Singapore and Dutch bills was relatively scarce, and prices were weak and declined. The circulation of rupee bills was lacking, while demand for Philippine bills increased, and the market was firm. The supply of Japanese gold bills turned smooth, and the market price was slightly weak, with an evening market price of 1.1305. Demand for Korean bills was scarce, and the market was also loose, with an evening market price of 1.1115.

Other currencies did not change.

### Securities Formation of Wait-and-See

Yesterday's informal securities market remained weak due to a lack of investor confidence. Although the downward trend felt slightly reduced, it still lacked vitality. However, having fallen by several yuan over the past few days, the amount of unsecured positions has gradually increased, and caution should be taken against a rebound. The pressure from all sides has loosened, and there is no exciting trading. Perhaps after a period of preparation, there will be further activity. Yesterday's situation saw a slight pullback in the morning, with prices slightly firm, but selling pressure remained stronger, moving slowly downstream. The noon close was still lower than the previous day. Afternoon trading was clearer, with supply still exceeding demand, falling by another 0.1 to 0.11, and the situation was slightly eased. As a result, it continued to decrease by 0.2 to 0.4. Type D was unique, decreasing by 0.95 due to the lottery relationship. The total number of transactions was estimated at 40 to 50 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Stock: Fifty shares of the Silk Industry Bank were traded, with a price of 22.5 yuan.

The rest were unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Weak, Coarse Yarn Market Strong, Factories Open Sales One After Another, Sales Plateaus Fall Again

The yarn market, which had risen for two consecutive days, was dispirited yesterday due to the wavering of speculators caused by the fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate, and their buying intention was not firm, which was far more disappointing than the previous day. As a result, the market plateau declined. Although there was no large-scale development of actual demand, the Hong Kong banks' appetite for 10-count coarse yarn was still not weak. However, most of them directly opened sales to the factories, and the prices were considered cheap. Speculators did not hoard much of this cotton yarn in their hands, so the impact on the market was not great. However, the trading of 20-count fine yarn was still slow and sluggish. After the close of 20-count Double Horse, it decreased to 648 yuan, a decrease of 12 yuan compared to the previous day. Other yarn prices were flat.

At the opening of the spot yarn market, there were rumors of a loosening trend in the foreign exchange rate, and speculators scrambled to sell, and the price fell by 10 yuan. 20-count Double Horse started at 658 yuan, and gradually declined to 650 yuan. However, guest banks sold Double Horse and traded in 10-count coarse yarn, resulting in the price of fine yarn being weak and coarse yarn being high. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 915 bales were traded, compared to 1,415 bales on the previous day. The price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 6.5 yuan, Double Globe fell by 7 yuan, and Celestial Maiden fell by 5 yuan. Chongxin Factory opened 400 bales of 21-count Dafa, with a price of 620 yuan, and 200 bales of 10-count Dafa, with a price of 515 yuan. Tongyi Factory opened 100 bales of 20-count Golden Rooster, with a price of 630 yuan, and 100 bales of 13-count Golden Rooster, with a price of 635 yuan. Yong'an Factory opened 150 bales of 10-count Golden City, with a price of 550 yuan. Today, 135 pieces of yarn were shipped to Xiamen, and another 180 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of yarn purchased by each gang is listed on the left.

### Cotton Transactions Still Lively Among Peers

Although the transactions of this cotton are not thin, they are all transactions among peers. The selling price is slightly higher. The factory has not traded any packages, and the market remains stable. Overseas Indian and American cotton markets have improved and are advancing daily. Unfortunately, the foreign exchange rate has turned calm, and people's hearts are still quiet. The origin of northern Jiangsu includes 1,230 bales of general cotton and 270 bales of northern sand cotton. The current situation of spot cotton is recorded on the left (transaction prices are all for cash-on-delivery).

Another message from Shanghai indicates that foreign cotton transactions have been quiet in recent days due to the unpredictable nature of the exchange rate. Peers are quite interested in buying, but it is unknown how to start. Japanese factories are also very quiet, as if they are waiting for something. Tens of thousands of bales of US cotton have already been shipped and are expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month or the beginning of next month.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was active from the beginning of the morning. Liverpool and Bombay telegrams reported good news. People were extremely excited due to the passage of the cotton loan regulations, and the market was extremely active, attracting strong purchases from all parties and the offsetting of some short positions. As a result, the closing price rose sharply by more than 10 British pounds compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose by more than 9 rupees, Egypt rose by more than 20 British pounds, and Liverpool rose by more than 30 pence.

### Grains Guest Demand is Strong New Japonica Rice Follows

Yesterday, the guest pointed rice market continued to rise, because the arrival of goods was still interrupted, and speculators took advantage of the trend to pull in. At the opening in the morning, there were hoarders who came out to search for it, resulting in most of the market goods being gone in an instant, and the market price immediately increased by half a yuan. However, the road to this village is ordinary, so the result is not as sensational as the previous market. It is estimated that Jiangbei rice closed at 24.2 to 23.8 yuan, and Jingwu special rice closed at 24.23 to 23.5 yuan. More than 20 cars of various goods such as new japonica rice arrived yesterday from Sujia Kuntai Fengqing, etc. In terms of sales, because the general appraisers saw the guest pointed rice rise all the way, the price standard of new japonica rice was relatively low, and they all did it smoothly. The guest vendors were also unwilling to release it lightly, so the market was generally flat and rebounded, with an increase of 4 to 5 cents. The price of Luyang pointed rice followed high by 2 to 3 cents, and the prices of Yao green rice and Yuan rice were all tight. The total number of transactions in the market was more than 8,000 bags.

Yesterday, the guest Xian rice market rose again. The inventory of Jiangbei Xian rice will be exhausted, and the subsequent shipment has not arrived. Although there is a rumor that Wuhu Xian rice will be transported by Chinese merchants and Japanese merchants in cooperation, there is still a lack of a whole batch to arrive in port, and even large Japanese merchants have not transported in large quantities. The local market price has gradually followed. Therefore, the market was already firm at the opening in the morning. Then, a large hoarding bank absorbed more than 2,000 bags, which immediately soared by 5 to 6 cents. The asking price for Jiangbei Xian rice has reached more than 24 yuan, while Wuhu Xian rice has reached 24.3 yuan. In addition to hoarding banks,客鄉舖作 is also quite active, with more than 2,000 bags also being traded. However, in the subsequent market, the 客囤 stopped buying due to excessive price codes, and the situation was soft.

### Off-Grade White Bag Flour Only Sells for 5.2 Yuan

Since the factory price of flour was reduced by 1 cent, the retail transactions in this street have been slightly lively. However, the passenger transformation is difficult to stimulate for a while, because various miscellaneous brand flours are dumped everywhere in the inland, and the market is suddenly caught off guard. The Beiyang gang continues to process thousands of bags of off-grade flour. It is said that the No. 4 powder red god has been opened for 6.6 yuan, the Fuxin white bag flour has been opened for 5.2 yuan, and the cannon powder still needs 7.4 yuan. The guest sales are only a decoration. The total number of transactions in the market is estimated to be more than 30,000 bags, the No. 2 powder factory board is 7.3 yuan, and the return goods are less than 5 cents to 1 cent.

The origin of wheat is sparse, and the market supply is also lacking. Both buyers and sellers still have a holding state. The factory does not covet, and the new hoarders are also unwilling to buy at high prices. As a result, the market transaction is silent, and the Fufeng factory suppressed the price and purchased about 20,000 bags of wheat from Guandian Changxi Jingwu, etc., with a price of 11.3 to 10.92 yuan, which is already a depreciation of 2 to 3 cents compared to the previous.

### Miscellaneous Grains Sesame Rebounds Violently - Yellow Soybeans Also Open

Since the sesame market has been supported by the environment in the past two days, foreign banks have become active, and hoarders have been searching for stocks. People's hearts have rebounded violently, and market prices have been frequently raised. Yangzhou sesame has been opened to 26.5 yuan and 26.1 yuan, with more than 200 bags traded. Mingguang sesame has been opened to 26.5 yuan and 26.1 yuan, with more than 200 bags traded, Mingguang sesame 600 to 700 bags, with a price of 29.3 yuan. The yellow soybean market has also opened up, and the export market, Hong Kong and other gangs, are asking for it. The stomach in this street is also wide, so the market has been slightly transformed. The total market is estimated to open more than 200 bags of Taicang beans (the price is detailed in the market price column), 300 bags of Wuhu beans, 200 bags of Nanjing beans, more than 100 bags of Pinghu Du beans, and more than 200 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans.

Today, 5,647 cans and 50 pieces of crude oil and 5,100 bags of beans were transported to Hong Kong, and 289 bags of beans were transported to Xiamen.

### Sugar Market Foreign Exchange Rises Again Foreign Sugar Reverts

According to the Dutch telegram, the price of raw white sugar was 11.50 Dutch guilders. According to the market association's draw, the foreign exchange rate has increased, and there has been another decline. The spot price of 24 raw white sugar initially fell by about 3 yuan, and then rebounded by about 1 yuan. As a result, it was weakly weakened by 2 yuan, with the price of the company being 50 to 50.05 yuan. The price of the foreign company was initially 50 yuan, then 50.05 to 50.09 yuan, and even 51.5 yuan. The re-export cargo was 40 to 40.5 yuan. The initial price of Taikoo cart white was reduced by 2.5 yuan, and the B mark was 54 yuan, which then rose to 55 to 55.5 yuan, which was still less than 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. CW mark and other products retreated according to the regulations, H mark cart red was 40 yuan, Dutch red was 41 yuan, this cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 50.5 yuan, No. 2 was 50 yuan, No. 3 was 49.5 yuan, No. 4 was 49 yuan, No. 1 ice was 61 yuan, Jingming ice was 62.5 yuan, and the national sugar only opened more than 80 pieces of Beihai Pianqing, 30 yuan. According to the investigation, 790 bags of sugar arrived from Xiamen yesterday.

### North-South Goods The Aftermarket of Lanzhu Branches is Tight

Xinghua longan cannot be continuously arrived because it needs to be exchanged for foreign exchange before it can be exported, and the cost is increased. It is heard that Lanzhu branches will be handled in the same way. From now on, the source will inevitably be scarce, and according to Zhangzhou telegrams, there are not many goods left, so be wary of further tightness.

### Piece Goods Horse Pants are in Short Supply

Horse pants and large coats are still popular. At yesterday's public tea party, there were continued mutual consultations and transactions. Wholesale merchants have been opening up every day, but the arrival of imported goods is lacking. Most of the traders are domestic Shen woven products, and the standard market price is quite high. General factories say that raw materials are scarce and expensive, and use the excuse that expenses are rising to increase prices. The unified sales price of Yihe, Zhanghua, and Yinfeng brands is 11.5 yuan, and the goods must be shipped out in complete cash. Therefore, although the market situation shows a shortage of supply, most buyers want to search for the old goods before the top, because there is no need to set a price, which has caused the output of each factory to be mostly.

45 pieces of cloth will be shipped to Hong Kong today, and another 105 pieces will be shipped to Xiamen.

### Silk and Tea The Difference Between Factory Inside and Outside Market Prices is More Than 100 Yuan Needle Eyebrows are Sold Well in Europe

Yesterday, the US silk market still showed a weak trend. Yokohama spot fell by 60 yuan, and forward fell by 64 yuan. New York spot Japanese silk fell by 0.11 yuan, Shanghai silk fell by 0.03 yuan, Guangdong silk fell by 0.1 yuan, near-term fell by 0.06 yuan, and forward fell by 0.09 yuan. Foreign firms in this port have very strict price limits. The difference between the internal and external market prices of Jili Jingbai Factory and other products is as high as 100 yuan, resulting in a stalemate. On the one hand, it is also due to the fact that buying and selling are waiting and watching the rise and fall of exchange rates, so there were no transactions yesterday. Thirty packages of the previous day's silk ends were shipped to Hong Kong.

The green tea market situation is not lonely. Needle eyebrow silk tea with excellent body bones has a smooth path. Ordinary Zhen eyebrows and Gongxi Xiu eyebrows and other goods are also sold. The whole city was purchased by Tongfu Baochang Baolong Yihe and other firms, more than 1,700 boxes of green tea. The market plateau is limited to needle eyebrows, which opened to 105 yuan, which is more than the previous price, and the rest are unchanged. Foreign firms are more actively reporting and installing goods due to the need for goods from foreign telegrams, and a total of more than 8,000 boxes will be exported next week. On the 11th, 18 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 12 pieces were shipped to Haiphong, and 6 pieces were shipped to Xiamen

### Coal Henan White Coal Sales Clear Prices Fall 3 to 4 Yuan

Henan white coal, due to the long-term interruption of its source in the past, and the lack of high-priced goods, the industry has been intending to hold it, and is unwilling to release it lightly. Recently, affected by the influx of Hongji, sales have been sluggish, and the market situation has had to reduce the plateau and give way. The industry has been dismantling prices, although they are calling 106 yuan, but the hoarders' warehouse slips have fallen by 3 to 4 yuan, and the number of transactions is still not many.

### Wenzhou Charcoal is Too Expensive East Ocean Charcoal is Sold

Wenzhou charcoal was short of cash last month, and the market situation has been extended again and again. The highest price was 12 yuan per load. Since then, merchants have seen the benefits of heavy capital and light capital, and have purchased from the various occupied areas of Suhang. A certain party has also processed a large batch of Dongyang grass-colored charcoal, resulting in more goods arriving every day, and the market situation has fallen. Yesterday, 6,000 packages were installed in Hongkou, and it was heard that the selling price was 4 yuan per package of Japanese gold, which is about 5.4 yuan in legal currency.

### Essays

— Pei Chu

The most prominent aspect of the modern spirit is probably "action." By "action," I mean being able to say it, being able to do it, not fearing any obstacles, and definitely achieving success. Our modern civilization is the result of the achievements of our predecessors' actions.

The day before yesterday, I also went to visit a Chinese language exhibition and felt another meaning of "action," which is about culture. In this exhibition, I spent the longest time looking at the Bible exhibited by the Bible Society. It not only exhibited Bibles in various languages from all over the world for us to see, but also exhibited Bibles in various dialects of China. Among them, in addition to the Ningbo, Xiamen, or other city dialects that we easily see, there are also Bibles in special dialects from the southwest, northwest, and northeast regions of China. We have almost never heard of these dialects. I really cannot but admire the spirit of action of the Western missionaries!

For us, Western missionaries are just like our monks and Taoists, whose profession is to preach and who do not engage in secular affairs. Since they are otherworldly people, in our opinion, they are just like our monks and Taoists, who can just practice tranquility and enjoy blessings without having to plan too much and ask for trouble. However, they are not like that. They want to act. They can not only go deep into barren and dangerous places to preach their doctrines, but also promote culture in these places at the same time. They published these Bibles in special dialects! They, as missionaries, are already doing so much. Needless to say, those non-missionaries who specialize in secular affairs work even harder. No wonder they surpass us in both spirit and material things.

Therefore, I turned around and thought about ourselves. There are many things that we should do, but aren't we hindering them, making people afraid to act, or being constrained and giving up on them? Let's not talk about other things, but take the new writing system as an example. It is almost the same thing as the Bible in special dialects. What achievements have we made? Why are we so far behind them? And this work of special dialects is precisely what we should be responsible for.

However, I am not trying to make pessimistic or disappointing remarks after all. We all know how to act now, and many things are being done, or are being done. Language exhibition can be said to be a kind of action!

### Mother

— Xiao Ping

The noisy sounds of the street gradually sank into the night.

Rain—endlessly falling on the silent streets.

From the dimly lit and weary street lamps, I vaguely saw slender strands of rain. October 29th was quietly dragged away by the god of night, and the 30th struggled to come in the darkness.

It was such a quiet autumn rainy night that I hurriedly stepped on messy steps, stepping over the road that had been wetted by hundreds, thousands, and millions of tiny raindrops, and hurried home.

The shops with iron doors tightly closed slowly receded around me, and soon I was approaching my home.

Two dark circles, a stern mother's face, appeared before my eyes. She was depressed because of her daughter's late return; at this time, listening to the frequent sad sound of the rain, she anxiously and resentfully missed her daughter who had not yet returned home.

I clearly realized that she was suffering from her daughter's "change," and sometimes she couldn't bear it and would angrily lash out at her beloved daughter unintentionally. But I love her, without any hatred for her. Mother is the mother I will always love. Mother said that I am a girl, so how can I go far away? But girls should also have a bright future in this era. It will never be like my mother's era...

But I don't intend to leave her either.

Because of my father's early death, she struggled to raise her daughter—me—in a difficult and weak life. She often shed tears for her unhealthy and sickly daughter. For more than ten years, the feudal family only gave her coldness, disdain, and coercion; she had tasted the pain of the world. Her only daughter can comfort her, and her hope is also closely tied to her daughter, hoping to live a happy life in the future.

Now——

She is disappointed. Her daughter is gradually deviating from her hopes, shattering her many years of expectations for her daughter.

Mother's bitter face brought me depression. I was always thinking about how I could comfort my most beloved mother in the world? I can't make her wounded heart suffer again. Once, and once again, and again, I failed.

Pain pierced my heart, and my mind was full of doubts. How can I persuade my mother, and that day when my mother can understand her daughter and become Gorky's "Mother"?

I wandered on the street like this. The rain was still so drizzly.

### Autumn and the Cold River

— Ding Ti

As long as I close my eyes, I cannot forget. A piece of virtual white floats on my eyes, the light is not dazzling, but it is so elegant, quiet, and gentle. It is as if I can imagine a vast and boundless river, where the sky and water meet, and the clear light is rendered on the painting, a piece of azure blue and a strip of green. The god crows and village drums have not been seen for many years, and spiders secretly fill the house with their formations. Under the thick dust, the vermilion paint of the pillars is buried. You can smell the bird droppings all over the ground. Occasionally, a few tiles fall beside the Buddhist shrine, covered with dust. A silent bell is sent from afar, and then you lean your body and listen to the sparrows chirping on the beams. It seems that autumn comes from the north of the river, or from the cold river. People living in the river city feel autumn earlier, and a dilapidated mountain is most suitable for autumn. When the reeds are blown by the wind and rise and fall with a rustling sound, when the boundless leaves of the villages are dyed yellow, you see everyone on the streets of the river city wearing thick padded jackets. There are few tourists in the temples in the dilapidated mountains all day long, and the stone benches and tables in the pavilions are even colder than ice. If you are clever, don't sit down. The new weather is clear and bright, the clear river is like a practice, and the desolation of the cold river brings a city of autumn, ...

Suddenly the calm waves trembled. There was such a day, when the night was dark and the wind was high, we heard the cries of many innocent people. In October, on a sailboat, on the north and south banks of the river, I spent more than ten days on the river. In the night sky dotted with starlight, the huge figure of the pagoda cast a shadow on the gray river. At night, we could hear the roaring waves hitting the boat, one wave after another. In the bleak morning when the mountain mist first opened, the mountains were green, the wind was high, and the sky was urgent. I couldn't say I loved the cold river anymore, and my heart was shrinking and I couldn't feel a trace of warmth. In the pale dawn of the reeds, thin branches swayed in the gray sky, and a dog barked in the cold. The deck was slippery, as if covered with a thin layer of ice. The dark shadows of the jungle surrounded a small village; there were sparse lights in the board door, and one or two "kerosene lamps" were also lit at the cable boat under the bridge, flickering in the square doorway. The sharp night wind, like scissors, passed through the cracks in the ship's planks and stung the face. Occasionally, looking out the window, it was a piece of silent darkness. Does the water of my hometown not flow here? Everyone wanted to explore all the unknown mysteries from the dark shadows, but they were all disappointed. The harbor of the river is winding, and the twists and turns are a bit strange. In front, behind, left, and right of the village, there is a vast expanse of water. Pointing the pole, the boat swung over, and the old man in the east helped the child on the west bank into the house. Day by day, the leaves on the shore were yellower than before, and people wearing cotton robes still had to bask in the sun. The river wind was biting, and the river water was even colder. Ten days of life on the boat consumed the remaining autumn without a trace. You say that is also a peaceful autumn, a cold river with a fluke of autumn? Ah, no, no. In a moment of drifting on the cold river, in the bleak October, I wrote the words "homesickness" on the river, on the yellow leaves of autumn. I miss Jiangcheng. I cannot forget a state of mind of autumn, the autumn river, the melancholy on the river.

I have spent two autumns, in this big city. When the spire of the church seems more gloomy in the evening wind, the autumn on the river is also deep. Flowing in the streets of towering buildings, the wind roars, rolling into a vortex like a swift current. On the streets near the Bund, the sunlight is as thin as winter. The wind on the river brings distant dreams, and a layer of virtual white floats on my eyes, and then a pile of melancholy, like dark clouds. On the shore where battleships and giant ships are crowded, I can see that piece of river, the autumn on the cold river.

Piled up in the thick dust, for many years the peaceful river, autumn, Jiangcheng, the god crows and village drums, under the shrine of Fo Li, ... I cannot say I love the cold river anymore. In the bleak October weather, on the vast river, the night of the waves, the morning of the frost, life is like an ant running around on a hot pot, that drifting bitterness! From the small city with dim lights on the water to a big city by the sea, I searched everywhere for the lost autumn. Autumn comes from the cold river, it is deep and then remains, one year, two years, three years. Maybe you can imagine a bit of the scenery of your hometown Jiangcheng from the Bund, but what about the lost autumn—from the disturbance, where should you take back a share of peace?

### Introduction to "A Brief History of Late Qing Small Newspapers"

— Ru Hui

There has never been a precise statistic on how many kinds of small newspapers there were in the late Qing Dynasty. According to the existing documents, Li Chuang Woluo Sheng's "Illustrated Anecdotes of Shanghai for Leisurely Reading" (1905) said that there were ten kinds of newspapers "using playful writing to provide people with leisure." The list is as follows:

Prosperity Daily, Laughing Forest Daily, Game Daily, Leisure Daily, Fable Daily, Collection Daily

New Shanghai Daily, Flower World, Flowery Days Daily, Spring River Flower Moon Daily

Nan Ting Ting Zhang's "List of Lost Newspapers in Shanghai" (1906) listed more, a total of sixty-six kinds. However, most of them are still newspapers that report current events. Only the following twelve kinds can be determined as small newspapers:

Art Forest Daily, Strange News Daily, Strange New Daily, Laughing Daily, Handbook Daily, Flying Daily

Spring River Flower Moon Daily, Laughing Daily, Interesting Daily, China Small Daily, Leisure Daily, Literature Club

Daily

Combined with the "Miscellaneous Records of Leisurely Reading," there are a total of twenty kinds. Later works on the history of newspapers also occasionally touched on this, but they only briefly mentioned the numbers of "Prosperity," "Games," "Fables," and "Collection." Unexpectedly, I accidentally obtained seven kinds that were not found in the lists of Woluo Sheng and Nan Ting Ting Zhang:

Entertainment Leisure Daily, Romance Vernacular Daily, Dialect Daily, Suzhou Vernacular Daily, Popular

News, Auspicious Shadows Daily, and Live in the Moment Daily

A total of twenty-seven kinds. This is the largest known number of small newspapers at that time. Among the twenty-seven kinds, the following seven have not been found: "New Shanghai," "Flower World," "Art Forest," "Strange News," "Strange New," "Laughing," and "Handbook." I am afraid that even the already found parts will eventually be lost, so I will describe the outlines of the twenty kinds that have been obtained to preserve them.

### Derogatory Films will Disappear, Hollywood Understands China, Changing Styles is the Gift of the War of Resistance

— Xin Ying

In the past, we knew that Hollywood film companies often had many misunderstandings about China, and derogatory films could often be found. Even in films with derogatory content, they would find Chinese actors to play humiliating roles. Didn't Anna May Wong play many such roles in the past?

But now, Hollywood film companies have realized the non-counting nature of this policy, because Hollywood films have a large market in China. If you transport this kind of film to China for screening, it will cause Chinese people's aversion. The things China has performed in the film are inconsistent with the facts. China is an ancient country that was civilized earliest, and she has an indelible splendid culture.

On the other hand, Chinese actors have also thoroughly realized in recent years that they only knew how to earn wages in the past, and everything was arranged by the producers or directors. They were asked to play what kind of role, and they played what kind of role. They didn't know anything about insulting China. Now, they know that playing this kind of role is insulting to their motherland, which will not only make their compatriots dissatisfied, but also affect their own future. Therefore, they have paid attention to this issue. In the future, when they encounter companies asking them to play derogatory roles, they will politely refuse.

Under this situation, Hollywood film companies will not only avoid making films with derogatory content in the future, but also decide not to have Chinese actors play roles such as child slaves and servants. This will eliminate disputes or misunderstandings caused by the public screening of films in China. And we believe that this war of resistance in China has changed the entire world, seeing that China is the largest country in the Far East with unlimited prospects. This is indeed a major reason for accelerating Hollywood's change of this policy!

### Chaplin Participates in the War of Resistance

— Hua Zhi

"The Dictator," starring the screen comedian Chaplin, has been rumored for more than a year. The central consciousness of the film portrays a certain dictator in Europe as a poor little soldier, which inevitably causes international trouble. The film production has been suspended several times. Whenever Chaplin wants to continue filming, a secret group will warn him with threats to take his life. Chaplin has to add and delete content and rename it "The Great Dictator," but he still has no intention of completing it. After the start of the European War, the situation is of course different. Chaplin also became motivated and prepared to join the democratic front to fight for the Jews. In view of the fact that British and French film actors have returned to their countries to join the army, he recently closed himself in the Kemala room, buried himself in filming, working ten hours day and night, preparing to finish it quickly and increase the power of publicity. When Chaplin is filming, the guards outside the door are heavily guarded, with ten armed guards to prevent people from breaking in and disrupting. It is said that this film will instill political consciousness, not just satire. Chaplin also told a friend: "In short, Hitler is no laughing matter." Some news reporters believe that Chaplin has made a great determination to resist the war, and "The Dictator" will be his last work. After that, he will imitate the famous Shakespearean actor Sir Gielgud in Britain and join the British infantry and set off for the front line. If this is true, then Charlie Chaplin, the comedian of thirty years, has completely changed his style.

### Recent News from Storytelling Theaters

— Di Sheng

Xu Yunzhi recently started singing the new book "Hetongji" at Yalu Teahouse "Rimen." This book is taken from the Yue opera story of the true and false Wang Qingming. The Tan Huang theaters often perform it, which can attract audiences; and Xu is the pioneer in adapting it to string and wind instruments. It is said that the "script" is written by a certain chapter novel writer. Although the structure of the plot is generally not bad, the "chapter" is still not stable and is inevitably mediocre. It should be regarded as the same level as Zhu Zhao's "Crying and Laughing Marriage," so the old listeners have mixed praise and criticism for it.

Pin Fang recruited Kang Youhua, a famous artist from Kuanyi Society, to tell the Yangzhou book "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," which reduced a good base for female storytellers in Puyu Society.

The Fuchun Night Teahouse is still closed. Recently, "Miao Wang" Xia Hesheng volunteered to recruit famous artists, and there is news that the night teahouse will reopen soon. Xia has done "New Year's file" in Fuchun this spring, and his reputation is not bad, which has achieved good results. This time, he has considerable confidence in the box office for "reopening the file."

Employees of Guangyu and Runyu Societies have always been very enthusiastic about public welfare undertakings. Now that all walks of life in Shanghai are enthusiastically raising donations for winter clothes, the colleagues of the two societies have also initiated a large-scale singing association, storytelling association, and series opera activities to respond and raise donations on a large scale.

Dance troupe writing shadows

### Life

I remember one day when I watched a drama at the Xuan Palace. When the curtain opened, there was a dancer living in the front room, with many modern furniture arranged. The dancer sat on a soft sofa, listening to the radio, talking to guests on the phone, and enjoying material civilization as much as possible. A country girl lived in the back pavilion, and a dying old woman was lying on a broken bed. The second landlord was chasing her like his life to ask her to pay the rent she owed. The country girl didn't know what to do, so she suddenly ran to the front room to ask the dancer for some help, to think of a way out for her to maintain her life. But the dancer loudly asked, do you want to live or live? If you want to live, you should persevere in maintaining the ambition you have set, and what does it matter if you are a little embarrassed or hungry. If you want to live, what you can sell now is your flesh. (The general idea is like this.) At that time, there were several dancers in the audience who frequently wiped their eyes with handkerchiefs, probably shedding tears of sympathy.

"I did evil in my previous life, and I am a dancer in this life." Even the red star with a monthly income of more than a thousand yuan also said so. However, in the eyes of a group of poor women, dancers eat delicacies, wear woolen silk, and there are many gentlemen and young masters who pursue and flatter them. What's so bad about that? Alas, swallow the broken teeth into your stomach, and you know the suffering yourself. Currently, at the Paramount, there are two red stars who told me that I really believe and sympathize with their plight. A friend objected, "You are not a dancer, how do you know the suffering of dancers?" I said, "You are not me, how do you know I don't know the suffering of dancers?" This is just copying the old article of Mr. Zhuang, but unfortunately that friend doesn't understand, and he still wants to ask the two red stars to testify.

According to this, is it possible for dancers to only seek to live and not to live? No, no, there are many prominent people who drive in high carriages and驷, but they are not living, they are just living luxuriously. The Western philosopher said, "People eat to live, not live to eat." Therefore, the two words "life" must be put together to have meaning, otherwise it will become a walking dead. But this is a question of knowledge, not a question of occupation. In any industry, there are virtuous people and there are scoundrels. Confucius said, "At fifteen, I set my heart on learning, and at thirty I stood firm..." Dancers, do you want to live? You should first humbly study, learn some knowledge, learn the principles of being a human being. When you discover the bright road of life, you will definitely have the joy and ambition to move forward, and you will no longer feel world-weariness and distress.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

A Drama that Praises National Heroes

Chinese dramas are mostly entertaining in nature. There are also many who advocate old virtues such as loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness, but there are very few who praise national heroes and can be called national defense dramas. There is a Kunqu opera called "Ningwu Pass," also known as "A Family of Martyrs," which does meet the above two conditions. However, the lyrics are profound and the music is high and few can sing it. Kunqu opera is gradually declining and on the verge of extinction. On the contrary, Pihuang, which has a shorter history, can be popularized throughout the country and is warmly welcomed by people of all levels. Therefore, it is a pity that there is such a good drama, which can also be adapted to the ideological trend of modern times, but it is buried and gradually forgotten by the world. If drama lovers do not actively promote it, I am afraid that within a few years, there will be a lament for the loss of good works and the dispersal of songs in Guangling. Therefore, I am now specially narrating the plot of the drama to arouse the attention of the Chinese people. If playwrights can adapt it into Pihuang and have a capable bearded male lead actor who is proficient in both martial arts and literature perform it, it is expected that it will inspire people's hearts today and gain the warm approval of the audience.

In the late Ming Dynasty, eunuchs monopolized power and politics were corrupt. Although Emperor Chongzhen was not a monarch who brought about the downfall of the country, the imperial government had deteriorated to the point where it could not be remedied. Traitors deceived the emperor, and heavy taxes were levied. The roving bandits rose up everywhere, and the Qing soldiers took advantage of the opportunity to invade from outside. The rebellious thieves disturbed from within. Even with the wisdom of Emperor Sizong, the general trend was gone and could not be reversed. Among the officials, only the eunuch Wang Chengen and the general Li Guozhen were wholeheartedly devoted to the country and sacrificed themselves for the country after Yuan Chonghuan. (138)

### Amateur Music Concert

— Ru Yun

At 8 pm on the 19th of this month, there will be a grand music concert at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. The participants in this music concert include the best amateur musicians in Shanghai, the Conservatory of Music, and the singing classes of various amateur groups, all with their best personnel participating. It can also be said that this "Shanghai Amateur Music Circle Concert" is a total mobilization of amateur music talents in Shanghai.

In terms of programs, there are solo piano, violin, guitar, etc., ensemble and solo singing, etc. The most eye-catching is the large chorus of more than one hundred people, which gathers the essence of each group. The program to be sung has been decided to be Huang Zi's posthumous work, but which song has not yet been decided. It is probably nothing more than "The Flag is Flying" and "The Hunt."

In terms of ticket prices, there are two types: one yuan and two yuan. This is because the YMCA does not have many seats originally, and some of them have to be reserved for the performers themselves, so it has to be like this. In addition to being sold at the venue on the day of the event, tickets were also sold in advance to all walks of life, so it is probably no problem to be full.

Since Shanghai became an "isolated island," small-scale concerts of a recreational nature have been held from time to time, but this is the first time that the elites of the entire music world have gathered together. It symbolizes the unity of the amateur music world on the "isolated island," and it is the starting point for establishing the expansion from quantity to quality.
