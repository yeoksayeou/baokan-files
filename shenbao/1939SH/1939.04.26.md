The Jugular Vein of the Japanese Army in Hunan and Hubei is Severed

Guilin: The news of the recapture of Gaoan, Tongshan, and other places has spread here, and all citizens are celebrating with joy and high morale. A Central News Agency reporter specifically visited a senior staff officer of the headquarters this morning to inquire about the importance of recapturing the two major strongholds. He excitedly replied, "Our army has firmly grasped the enemy's jugular vein, causing their limbs to sink into an inescapable quagmire." He continued, "Gaoan is a shortcut to invade Changsha from the north. The enemy's strategic intention in making every effort to occupy it lies in this. However, after the enemy was exhausted in the Battle of Nanchang, we responded with our original strength, giving the enemy the most violent assault, and Gaoan was recaptured. The enemy in Nanchang is now under our control. Under the pressure of our effective power, they have lost the ability to counterattack and will increasingly fall into our encirclement, leading to collapse. The recapture of Tongshan was indeed beyond the enemy's expectations and is also a victory in our strategy. Tongshan is a major stronghold for the enemy in the northern Hunan-Jiangxi war sequence and a transportation hub for Jiujiang, as well as an important auxiliary to the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway. Our army's recapture of this area is tantamount to driving a fatal wedge into the enemy's core, cutting off their blood supply and severing their limbs. The enemy's situation is gradually becoming unfavorable. Therefore, in our army's continued fierce offensive, the enemy's future crisis is serious, which can be understood without saying." (Dispatch from the 24th)

Japanese Dispatch Korean Reinforcements to Open Up Henan

(Chongqing) According to a Chinese military spokesman's statement today, Chinese guerrillas have cut the Tongpu Railway into several sections. Fierce fighting has now broken out at the southern end of the railway. The Japanese authorities have dispatched a large army to Shanxi and Kaifeng to resist the advance of the Chinese forces. The Japanese commander, deeply aware of the strength of the Chinese offensive, has dispatched 10,000 Korean troops to Kaifeng, Shanxi, in an attempt to resist. In addition, the fighting around Linfen is very intense. In the past ten days, the Japanese army has suffered over a thousand casualties. The Chinese forces on the central China front are advancing westward and eastward from Tongshan. It is reported that Daban has been recovered. Chinese forces are now continuing to advance towards Nanchang. They are also attacking Fengxin and Jing'an, because if the Chinese forces recapture the above two places, they can advance eastward, cut off the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway, and inflict a major blow on the Japanese army's lines of communication. The spokesman also stated that he believed that the Japanese side was gathering heavy troops in Suiyuan, Pingjin, Shanghai, and other places, so that once a war broke out in Europe, the above areas would become the basis for future wars, or could become the center for responding to demonstrations by certain European countries. However, assuming that war does not break out in Europe, the above areas will take a defensive stance and not attack. (Associated Press Dispatch from the 25th)

Editorial

### Britain's Conscription Problem and the International Situation

It is quite pointless for us to offer our approval or opposition to the internal political issues of other countries, especially when they are still being debated and unresolved within those countries. However, today, let us briefly discuss the issue of Britain's implementation of conscription. This matter is not pointless; it is of utmost importance.

Britain has historically adopted a volunteer army system, and later, to adapt to the needs of the environment, it also adopted a "National Volunteer Service System." Recently, it has been advancing at full speed towards a "National Mandatory Service System," "National Military Training," "Conscription," and the advocacy and movement of other modified conscription methods. Progressing gradually, it is nearing maturity, and thus the issue of implementation has been raised. The advocacy and movement have been sharp for several months, and yesterday it was the main topic of discussion in the cabinet meeting; it has not yet been formally discussed, so of course no decision has been made. Examining the divisions of the issue, the majority of cabinet members advocate establishing the principle of implementing conscription, but their plans under the principle are not entirely the same; there is also a faction in power who believes that conscription is a new method that violates British traditional thinking and traditional methods. Now, those who advocate and move for the implementation of the new method are the authorities of the Conservative Party, which has always been considered orthodox, while the more progressive opposition party opposes it. It has evolved into a reversed spectacle, almost a comedic role reversal. Although each has its own arguments, we need not discuss the affairs of the British Isles.

What we will discuss is that the problem is in Britain, but the impact is international. World events are like drawing silk threads or peeling bananas; the more you draw or peel, the deeper you go, and the more the true nature is revealed. In other words: the world's chaos is caused by very complex factors, but it is quite related to the decline of British power; the world's stability depends on many efforts, but if Britain can quickly catch up, it will be an important factor in stability. Therefore, attributing the chaos to Britain and crediting the stability to Britain are both excessive, but the closeness and importance of the connection are undeniable. Italy successively destroyed Abyssinia and Albania, shedding only a small amount of blood; to destroy a country with so little bloodshed, proportionally far less than slaughtering chickens and cattle, the cost is not worth mentioning. Germany successively annexed Austria and Czechoslovakia, without shedding a drop of blood. It is said that knowing oneself and knowing the enemy guarantees victory in every battle; the four countries that were destroyed and annexed were indeed deeply known by Germany and Italy, so they were seized in one fell swoop. But isn't Britain acting as the leader of Europe? In the League of Nations, it was clearly the leader; for more than ten years, it has been supporting Germany and Italy, clearly the leader; for the past month, it has been providing guarantees to Poland, providing guarantees to Romania, determined to provide guarantees to Eastern Europe and all the countries of the Balkan Peninsula, again clearly the leader. How dare Germany and Italy disregard the leader and act so recklessly? It's nothing more than that Germany and Italy, who shed only a small amount of blood or even no blood, have actually made the world talk of tigers and change color, and praised them as military powers, simply because Britain, with its generosity, is a non-military leader. Knowing oneself and knowing the enemy, Germany and Italy also know Britain.

Britain has always taken Germany and Italy lightly, saying that I have more pounds and they are poor, but they don't know that pounds cannot be directly used to deal with German and Italian air raids to ensure the safety of the pounds. Only when they used pounds to strengthen air defense did they begin to slightly restore the appearance of a leader. However, Germany and Italy's wings are gradually becoming full, and the momentum is like a prairie fire. Although Britain possesses an absolute advantage in the navy, it has quickly caught up and has an air force that is evenly matched. Not to mention that the decisive key to a full-scale war is that there must be a large army; even if there is no war, without a large army in diplomacy, there is no way to gain the trust of strong allies and obtain allies, nor can it comfort weak allies and overcome guarantees. A few days ago, France expressed doubt about Britain's inability to resolutely improve its current army system; such expressions of doubt have profound implications in diplomacy. Britain's negotiations with the Soviet Union have been going on for a long time, but have not yet been completed. The key to the rumors is not entirely credible, but the weakness of Britain's army strength, insufficient to be an ally of the Soviet Union, is also a possible reason. Which countries in Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula do not fear the fierce aggression of Germany and Italy? They should all be inclined to the goodwill guarantees of other powerful countries, but those who run between London and Paris also go to Berlin and Rome; why is this so? Isn't it because they fear that although Britain promises guarantees, its weak army strength will be unable to do anything? Even if France and the Soviet Union, as well as the countries of Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula, are not satisfied with Britain's small army; in Germany and Italy, from the diplomatic stage to speeches, although they see the aging and growing strength of Chamberlain, who is determined to be a hero, but based on the fact that Britain's army system is content with the status quo and remains small for a long time, it can also be seen that the internal contradictions in Britain are deep, and there is no determination to stand up and resist aggression.

In summary: In any country, changing from a mercenary system to implementing conscription is a technical issue of expanding the army, a system issue, and need not be discussed further. Whether Britain implements conscription or not can be observed in the future strength of the British army, one; observe whether Britain has the determination to participate in European affairs. The second; observe whether Britain is effective in stabilizing the situation in Europe, the third; observe the organization of the anti-aggression group, whether it is established, how strong or weak it is, the fourth; observe whether the aggressor countries are afraid of the anti-aggression group, the fifth. Because of these five points, the issue of Britain's implementation of conscription cannot be regarded as Britain's internal political issue; if conscription is implemented immediately, and the Anglo-Soviet alliance is completed as a result, then the matter is of even greater importance.

### Military Affairs Committee's Battlefield Propaganda Outline

The Task of Propaganda (Continued from yesterday)

The Task and Target of Battlefield Propaganda Work According to the instructions summarized by the Minister in the discussion and resolution regarding the future work of the Political Department, the tasks of battlefield political propaganda are: (A) to initiate and expand guerrilla warfare, (B) to establish and consolidate our revolutionary regime, (C) to more strongly organize the masses behind enemy lines and compete with the enemy for the people, (D) to eliminate traitors, destroy puppet organizations, disintegrate puppet troops, and shake enemy troops, and (E) to destroy the enemy's transportation and hinder all the enemy's political, economic, and cultural facilities, so as to make the enemy exhausted and surrounded and attacked by our vast revolutionary forces, until they collapse.

Therefore, the targets of battlefield political propaganda can be mainly divided into the following four types: (A) officers and soldiers of regular troops and guerrilla fighters, (B) the masses behind enemy lines, (C) officers and soldiers of the enemy and puppets, and (D) prisoners of war. The supreme leader, in his instruction at the senior political work conference, earnestly pointed out the meaning of political work and the scope of its education, saying, "Political workers are the political education between the army and the people, so that they understand the political implementation of policies," and also said, "The scope of education is not limited to the troops and their subordinates, but all places where the army is stationed, with the surrounding environment, should take the army as a model and generate the function of educating the people." In the political propaganda work of the troops, naturally the officers and soldiers of the troops are the first target, and it is necessary to help the troops' training, improve discipline, improve morale, help the wounded and sick, and prevent desertion. Secondly, joining the army as soldiers and retiring as civilians are originally one body, and in fighting behind enemy lines, it is especially necessary to obtain the support and endorsement of the people. The leader's instructions pointed out that the army must become a model for the people, "generating the function of educating the people." At the same time, the Minister instructed that "cooperation between the military and the people is the only element for us to defeat the enemy, and in the enemy's rear, we must compete with the enemy for the people, so the discipline of the troops is the highest requirement of the War of Resistance." Therefore, the political propaganda work for the people behind enemy lines must be earnestly responsible by the political workers of the troops, and it is best to ensure that every soldier can become a propagandist and educator for the people. Thirdly, the battlefield is the rear of the enemy, and contact with the enemy is frequent. Not only is there an urgent need to "eliminate traitors, destroy puppet organizations, disintegrate puppet troops, and shake enemy troops" in combat, but there is also the convenience of making our propaganda against the enemy and puppets penetrate and expand in terms of propaganda technology. Therefore, the officers and soldiers of the enemy and puppets are also important targets of battlefield political propaganda work. As for the propaganda and education work of prisoners of war, if done well, it will be of great help to our propaganda against the enemy.

The Key Points of Propaganda

Yin Key Points of Battlefield Propaganda The common key points of propaganda, the content and methods of propaganda, although they cannot but vary with the different targets, also have their commonalities. In order to avoid repetition in the narrative, the common key points for more than two types of targets are listed as follows:

A (Mainly for Troops and the Masses) (1) According to the historical facts of the Japanese寇's invasion of China over the past sixty years, Japanese imperialism is the only enemy of the Chinese nation, so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that the enemy and us are irreconcilable, and only by driving the Japanese寇 out of China can we live a peaceful life. (2) Publicize the Prime Minister's teachings and expound the Three Principles of the People, so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that implementing the Three Principles of the People is the most correct way to complete the War of Resistance and build the nation. (3) The Third National Political Council unanimously passed a resolution requesting the government to issue an order to the military and civilians of the country to obey the great righteousness declared by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in his declaration on December 26 of last year (referring to the instructions refuting the 近卫狂妾 statement), strengthen their confidence, unify their steps, be of one heart and one mind, and complete the great cause of restoring our sovereignty and administrative integrity and completing the War of Resistance from beginning to end, and it is especially necessary to make the military and civilians behind enemy lines deeply understand it. (4) At the same time, it is necessary to prove in many ways from theory and facts the key points indicated by the supreme leader's above-mentioned instructions, so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that the policies held by the Japanese閥 are fundamentally incompatible with the survival and independence of our nation and country and the order of East Asia and world peace, deeply understand our national policy of resisting the war and building the country, and understand the various deceptive propaganda that the enemy uses as an excuse. (5) According to the supreme leader's declarations and resolutions on resisting the war and building the country, his speeches and instructions on resisting the war, clarify that our country's resistance is not only to fight for the survival of the nation and the independence of the country, but also to ensure the peace of East Asia and the world (this point should also be publicized to enemy officers and soldiers). (6) Publicize the central government's important facilities for national politics, economy, culture, etc., based on the national policy of resisting the war and building the country, as well as the government's concern and expectations for the military and civilians behind enemy lines, so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand the progress of our country in all aspects and the central government's good intentions towards them. (7) Publicize the facts and news of the unity of the country from top to bottom, the victories of our army on various battlefields, the heroic battles of the frontline soldiers, the large number of strong men in various places requesting to join the army (such as Yong'an County and Dazu County), the enthusiastic donations from people and overseas Chinese in various places, and the active participation in the War of Resistance, in order to expose the enemy's rumors, encourage the enthusiasm of the military and civilians behind enemy lines to resist the war, and strengthen their confidence in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance. (8) Publicize the enemy's situation, especially regarding the unease in the Japanese寇's domestic politics, the decline of industry, the exhaustion of finance, the difficulties of life, the rising anti-war sentiment, the enemy soldiers' war-weariness, suicide, and anti-war rebellion (such as the enemy rebellion incidents in Dagu, Jiangyin, Guangzhou, Hankou, etc., such as the explosion of the Osaka arsenal, etc.), as well as the constant examples of the puppet army's revolt, so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that the Japanese寇's collapse is an inevitable trend. (9) Publicize the international situation, the favorable trends and news for us and the unfavorable trends and news for the enemy (such as the recent closer approach of the major democratic countries of England, America, France, and the Soviet Union, the three countries of England, America, and France denying the so-called "New Order of East Asia" by the Japanese寇 with the same note, advocating the validity of the Nine-Power Treaty, England and America's credit loans to our country, the League of Nations reiterating the resolution to condemn Japan and aid China, and the people of various countries' practical boycott of Japanese goods and the International Anti-Aggression Movement's delegates' adoption of aid to China, etc.), so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that the enemy is increasingly isolated and our country's international status is increasingly improving, and deeply understand that the more we persist in the War of Resistance, the more we can lead the international situation to anti-aggression (to be continued)

### Japanese Provoke Anti-British and Anti-American Movements in Guerrilla Areas They Hate Britain and America Because of Unfavorable Battles The First Voice of Expelling Europeans in Asia

(Chongqing) According to today's news, the Chinese side announced that the anti-British and anti-American movements instigated by the Japanese in the Japanese-occupied areas are spreading wider and wider. Recently, Anqing has even seen xenophobic sentiments, and all British goods in various stores have been searched and burned. The streets are full of British slogans. The Central Daily News commented on this matter, saying that the Japanese special service agency in Peiping allocated 500,000 yuan to subsidize the anti-British and anti-American movements and stipulated that it should be implemented immediately and engage in propaganda. It is also reported that the Japanese have drafted a plan to destroy all British and American church enterprises in China. The reason why the Japanese hate Britain and the United States so deeply is because of unfavorable battles. In the eyes of the Japanese warlords, Asia is Japan's private property, and Britain and the United States have no right to interfere. The so-called "New Order of East Asia" means that Asia belongs to Japan and Britain and the United States must withdraw. Japan believes that whether Britain and the United States aid China or not, they must withdraw. This boycott of Britain and the United States is the first voice of its "movement to expel Europeans from Asia." (Associated Press dispatch on the 25th)

### Britain Still Cherishes Peace Advising Germany to Pull Back from the Brink Hoping to Accept Roosevelt's Proposal Resolving Disputes Through Negotiations And Declaring Britain's Determination to Resist Aggression

Britain has sent a "frank note" to Hitler. According to British spokesmen, the content of this note is to seek peace and is also no less than a warning, because the note states that if the recent tense situation in Europe continues, it may force Britain to implement national conscription. Regarding the report that British Ambassador to Germany Henderson returned to Berlin yesterday with this note, British spokesmen have confirmed it. According to British official announcements, the content of the note includes the following points: (1) Reaffirming confidence that European problems can be resolved peacefully; (2) Suggesting that President Roosevelt's peace appeal provides an opportunity for Germany and Britain to cooperate in jointly seeking a solution to European problems. The note concluded by saying that Britain hoped that Hitler would not reject Roosevelt's proposal when responding to the US President on the 28th of this month; (3) Warning Germany that if it attempts to dominate Europe by force, Britain will resist. (Associated Press dispatch from London on the 25th)

(London) British Ambassador to Germany Henderson will meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop today. A Reuters diplomatic reporter said that it is generally speculated that Henderson will take this opportunity to explain some fundamental points of British policy, such as Britain's determination to resist continued aggression, and to clearly state that Britain has no intention of encircling Germany. Britain's policy has always been a peaceful policy, but it believes that it is necessary to eliminate the dangers attached to recent events. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

(London) According to the diplomatic correspondents of the newspapers this morning, British Ambassador to Germany Henderson, who returned to his post yesterday after being back in the country for a long time, brought a frank warning to Hitler on this trip. According to the "Daily Telegraph," Henderson will declare that if Germany does not have clear evidence of changing its policy, the British government will have no choice but to continue the organization of resisting aggression and will implement national conscription. Henderson will also suggest the steps that Germany can take, such as withdrawing its troops in Spain and demobilizing part of its mobilized troops at home. The reporter of the newspaper also said that Henderson will also tell that the British government is willing to use practical and peaceful consultation methods to resolve various outstanding issues, so the British government fully agrees with the position taken by President Roosevelt in his telegram to Germany and Italy, which has been clearly expressed in the dispatches repeatedly sent to Washington from London. "Daily Express" said that Henderson has asked Hitler for a personal meeting and believes that Henderson will strongly advocate the wisdom of accepting the ten-year or twenty-five-year peace plan proposed by the US President. The conclusion of Henderson's direct advice will be a frank warning, that is, if President Roosevelt's proposal is rejected, it will inevitably cause a tense international situation and the most negative repercussions in the world, especially in Britain. The "Daily Mail" also recorded this last point, "briefly stating" that Henderson will strongly argue that if the US President's appeal is rejected, it may increase international tensions to the point of breaking down. The diplomatic correspondent of "The Times" also mentioned Henderson's return to his post and Prime Minister Chamberlain's brief remarks on the matter in the House of Commons, saying that the government will firmly support both the warning and the opportunity given in President Roosevelt's telegram. In short, Henderson's return to his post will show that the government's policy has not changed, nor has it softened. This can be seen in the situation of domestic and overseas contacts in China in the past few weeks. British government officials are still unwilling to publish any instructions given to Henderson, but according to Reuters' diplomatic reporters, the British government seems to have given Henderson instructions.

### US Secretary of State Indicates Unwillingness to Follow in Britain's Footsteps Unwilling to Order Envoys to Germany to Return to Their Posts Before Receiving a Satisfactory Reply from Germany

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull said today that British Ambassador to Berlin Henderson's return to his post is something the US Ambassador does not want to follow. Officials here reiterated that they believed that President Roosevelt did not want to make any decisions regarding the US Ambassador's return to Germany before receiving Hitler's reply to his peace appeal telegram. The press and diplomatic circles here have received news that Hitler may try to reverse the order of President Roosevelt's suggestions, arguing that Germany must first obtain satisfactory economic and colonial demands before giving guarantees regarding its future intentions. News reaching Washington said that Hitler might try to revive the "appeasement policy" and point out that President Roosevelt's telegram is sufficient to prove the legitimacy of this action. All political circles here are aware that President Roosevelt does not want to be drawn into a trap in this matter, because those who have loudly opposed the "appeasement policy" so far are the supporters of President Roosevelt, and President Roosevelt, for internal political reasons, cannot apply for unilateral concessions from Britain and France to appease the Axis powers. The opinions revealed by the newspapers here, many believe, are from official instructions, saying that the "appeasement policy" is still in progress, but the United States cannot remain indifferent and oppose the suggestion of ceding West African land to the Axis powers, because this area is easy to extend its influence to reach South America. Some African federations are deeply afraid of being controlled by the Axis powers and have sought refuge in the United States, as can be seen in the recent actions of the Liberian Americans. They even called for the protection of the United States to resist the Nuremberg racial laws. Therefore, although the US government has not formally declared that it is not interested in the land issue, there are still some areas behind it, which are clearly becoming a negotiation issue that does not disturb the US government. Therefore, the general opinion is that Washington seems to formally insist on an accurate interpretation of President Roosevelt's suggestions. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

### French Ambassador Returned to His Post Yesterday Berlin Maintains a Calm Attitude

(Paris) French Ambassador to Germany Coulondre, who was recalled to the country in March of this year after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, has been away for more than a month. Officials here recently announced that British Ambassador to Germany Henderson returned to his post in Berlin yesterday. After contacting Britain, the French government also decided to order Ambassador Coulondre to return to his post in the afternoon of tomorrow, but there is no intention to negotiate with Germany at this time. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

(Berlin) After British Ambassador to Germany Henderson returned to his post today, semi-official sources here announced that the date of German Ambassador to Britain Dirksen's return to London has not yet been decided.

(Berlin) Officialdom here is cautious in its statements regarding the return of British Ambassador Henderson, saying that it is a completely ordinary event. However, there have been hints that Henderson's arrival is on a special mission. According to the "Hamburg Daily," we can tolerate the calm attitude taken by recent British diplomatic actions, waiting for the mission of the British Ambassador to return to his post at this time.

### European Small Countries Replied to Germany's Inquiry All Said They Had Not Been Threatened Romania Gave No Clear Answer

(London) Regarding the small European countries' replies to Germany's inquiry as to whether they had been threatened by German aggression, it is understood that, so far, sixteen countries have stated that they have not been threatened by German aggression. However, Romania stated that because it does not have a common border with Germany, it did not give a clear answer. (Haitong dispatch on the 25th)

(London) Reuters has learned that the Romanian government has today replied in the form of a note to Hitler's question as to whether Romania feels threatened by Germany. It is heard that the note states that Romania has no public animosity towards Germany, so it is difficult to determine whether it feels threatened by Germany. This question is best answered by Germany itself. The note also stated that President Roosevelt did not notify Romania before sending the peace telegram, but Romania had no doubts about the general situation in Europe. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

Lithuanian Capital The German Reich inquired of the Lithuanian government about the telegram sent by the President of the United States the other day, asking whether it had been threatened by Germany and whether it had encouraged President Roosevelt to send this telegram.

Capital of Bulgaria Regarding the German inquiry as to whether the Bulgarian government has been threatened by that country, officialdom here is tight-lipped. People generally believe that Germany did ask this question. As for the content of Bulgaria's answer, although it is not known, it must undoubtedly be negative, judging from the circumstances. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov recently made a statement saying that Bulgaria and Germany do not share a common border, and President Roosevelt's telegram to the German and Italian authorities the other day may not have included Bulgaria.

### Political and Economic Collaboration: Anglo-Romanian Compromise Established, Negotiations Conducted Simultaneously in Both Capitals, Considering the General Situation in Europe

(London) Following his arrival in this city, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu proceeded to the House of Commons this afternoon at 4:00 PM, where he held a one-hour meeting with Prime Minister Chamberlain. According to informed sources, a full compromise has been reached on various political and economic matters.

Regarding Economics: Britain will extend commercial loans to Romania to promote trade with Britain without increasing trade with Germany. However, Britain has no intention of granting a formal loan to the country, but will provide various facilities through the Treasury to enable Romania to sell its grains and other foodstuffs on the British market, and to use the proceeds to repay the commercial loans. The detailed plan will be finalized by Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the government's economic advisor, in the Romanian capital with the Romanian authorities.

Regarding Politics: The two main issues discussed by British and Romanian cabinet members were: first, the issue of Soviet cooperation in the event of future war; and second, the issue of mutual assistance between Poland and Romania. It is reported that Foreign Minister Gafencu still opposes Soviet troops passing through Romanian territory, and insists that Soviet cooperation should be limited to air force assistance and arms supplies. In addition, Foreign Minister Gafencu informed Prime Minister Chamberlain of his impressions gained during his talks with German leader Hitler in Berlin a few days ago. He will continue his talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, 24th)

Prime Minister Chamberlain only joined the talks in the afternoon. It is said that economic issues have not yet been raised, but may be brought up in the future. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

### Yugoslavia Expresses Strict Neutrality: Foreign Minister Returns Home to Report on Talks with Italy

Yugoslav Capital: Following the talks between Foreign Minister Marković and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano a few days ago, officials here have declared that Yugoslavia's foreign policy will not be altered as a result. It will remain loyal to the Balkan Entente and other countries. In short, Yugoslavia will maintain absolute neutrality and has no intention of joining the Comintern pact. Italy has not advised it to do so either, because Yugoslavia has not yet recognized the Soviet Union and has always rejected communism. The Communist Party in the country disappeared as early as twenty years ago, so there is no need to join the anti-communist pact. (Havas dispatch, 24th)

Yugoslav Capital: Foreign Minister Marković returned here yesterday from Venice and immediately paid a visit to Prince Regent Paul to report on his talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Venice.

### Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon Announces: British Budget for This Year Increased Twentyfold Compared to Eighty-Five Years Ago, National Defense Current Expenditure Accounts for £400 Million, Increased Taxes and Borrowing Seek to Balance Revenue and Expenditure

(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced the following items for increasing tax rates today in the House of Commons: surtax on annual income, tobacco tax, sugar tax, death duties, and motor vehicle horsepower tax. In addition, films will be subject to a new tax, and the tax rate for motorcycles will be changed. The Chancellor also stated that the standard rate of income tax will remain at five shillings and sixpence per pound, unchanged, to reassure the public. For annual incomes within the limit of £8,000, a surtax of £5 per £100 will be levied; for those above £8,000, a surtax of £10 per £100 will be levied. The tobacco tax will increase from two shillings to eleven shillings and sixpence per pound, and the sugar tax will increase by one-quarter of a penny per pound. Death duties will increase by 10% for estates valued at £50,000 or more. The Chancellor also stated that the film tax is expected to collect £1 million in a full year. The motor vehicle horsepower tax will increase from fifteen shillings to one pound and five shillings from January 1st. The tax rate for motorcycles will also be changed. The Chancellor continued that £20,000,000 of the deficit must be covered by tax revenue. Taxpayers must pay £942,000,000, and £380,000,000 must be raised through borrowing. The Chancellor also announced that the stamp duty on medicines would be abolished from September, and the tax on theaters and entertainment would be slightly reduced.

The House of Commons was very crowded today. The Chancellor rose at 3:45 PM to announce the budget, and everyone listened quietly. Before the announcement, several members raised questions, but the noise was so loud that they could not be heard. When the Chancellor spoke, there was a great cheer throughout the hall. The Chancellor first mentioned that when Gladstone was in power, the total amount of his first of thirteen proposed budgets was £53,000,000. The current budget has increased more than twentyfold compared to Gladstone's proposal to abolish income tax in 1853. The Chancellor made this statement to ease the atmosphere of the House, because at that time, the public did not yet know the contents of the budget he was about to propose. The Chancellor continued that income tax revenue was less than the estimated amount, but the surtax on income has exceeded the previous year's estimate. He felt that the increase in revenue was due to the effectiveness of the plan to prevent tax evasion. Last year, £20,000,000 was allocated to repay the national debt. The Exchange Equalization Fund continued to generate favorable profits. He intends to set the amount of debt repayment at £230,000,000, and if necessary, he can issue bonds to fill the statutory fund. The Chancellor finished his speech at 5:05 PM and sat down, having stood for eighty minutes.

### Overview of This Year's Budget

The tax revenue for this year's budget is £927,250,000, a decrease of £17,500,000 compared to the estimated amount, but an increase of £45,000,000 compared to the figures for 1937 to 1938. The total gross amount of various national defense expenditures, including air defense, is nearly £400,000,000. The previous year was £265,500,000. The total expenditure for the Debt Redemption Fund for 1939 to 1940 is £247,000,000, an increase of £5,000,000. The most serious and urgent problem is the additional national defense expenditure, which is also the main point of discussion in this year's budget. The estimated expenditure for supply affairs is £675,000,000. The estimated expenditure for air defense this year is £42,000,000. The total amount of expenditures to be paid from tax revenue is £922,400,000. This figure does not include additional national defense expenditure. The net total amount of the national debt has increased from £8,026,000,000 last year to £8,163,000,000. The total amount of tax revenue estimated based on the existing tax base is £918,331,000. The amount allocated from this fund for national defense this year is £223,500,000. The original amount to be allocated from tax revenue was £130,000,000. However, the original figure for national defense expenditure for this year was £580,000,000 (£350,000,000 of which was allocated from borrowing, and £230,000,000 was paid from tax revenue). It has increased in all aspects to £630,000,000, and may continue to increase. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

### The Issue of Britain Implementing Conscription: Heated Debate Among Various Factions, Labor Party Leader Explains Reasons for Opposition, Practical Difficulties Cannot Be Ignored

(London) The opposition Labor Party held a closed-door meeting this afternoon to discuss the issue of conscription, and it is reported that it still expressed its opposition. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

(London) Opposition Labor Party leader Major Attlee published an article in the Liberal Party's "Star Evening News" today, stating, "Our party firmly opposes conscription, and its attitude has always been consistent." Even if this system is implemented, it will not be effective until several years later. Moreover, since the government implemented the National Volunteer Service system, the results have been very satisfactory. Why bother with this? "Furthermore, if conscription is implemented, it is likely to cause internal friction, which may affect national morale." Labor Party members commented on Attlee's article, saying that this is not the party stubbornly adhering to its views and opposing the compulsory service system. Any plan should still be studied at any time to determine its direction. In other words, the party does not oppose it in principle, but practical difficulties must be taken into account, such as the lack of manpower in industry and commerce, and the insufficient allocation of armaments, all of which should be considered in advance. (Havas dispatch, 24th)

(London) Regarding the issue of implementing conscription, The Times recently analyzed the opinions of the government parties and the opposition parties, saying, "The government parties seem to have a strong argument for establishing the principle of compulsory military service. Most of them originally firmly believed that the current National Volunteer Service system is most suitable for Britain. Now they have also reached a conclusion that Britain, under the current circumstances, is the same as during the last European War and should abandon this traditional policy, thereby calling on the people of the whole country to make greater efforts to firmly support the current foreign policy. However, the government had previously provided assurances that Britain would not implement conscription in peacetime. This point cannot be ignored, but those who support the implementation of conscription say that since the government made this assurance, Britain's military commitments to various countries have increased dramatically, and the international situation is so tense that it cannot be regarded as peacetime. However, opponents such as the leaders of the Labor Party still insist that it is impossible. As for whether the members of the opposition party also take an opposing attitude, it cannot be generalized, and in the event of necessity, there may be dramatic changes in everyone's opinions, which is also reasonable."

### Germany Eyes Danzig Covetously, Attempting to Seize It: Has Become the Focus of the European Situation, Three-Country Committee Scheduled to Convene Next Month

(London) Well-informed political figures here have declared that German leader Hitler has reportedly decided to demand the annexation of the Free City of Danzig and the return of old colonies. When he delivers his speech on the 28th of this month, he will explain that this demand does not conflict with the telegram sent by US President Roosevelt, because Danzig was not originally owned by Poland, and Germany's old colonies were only mandated territories of various countries, which are different from formally affiliated territories. Germany's recovery of them cannot be said to be an invasion of other countries' territories. However, it is generally believed that regarding the Danzig issue, there is still a possibility for Germany and Poland to establish a friendly solution directly at the last hour. (Havas dispatch, 24th)

Free City of Danzig: It is rumored that the leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party in this city, Forster, gave a speech at a labor rally somewhere, saying that leader Hitler has promised to return this city to Germany within this year.

(Washington) Mrs. Fitch, who resided in China for twenty years and is now the leader of the California China Relief Association, reported to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today that she is convinced that China will eventually win the Sino-Japanese War. The proposed amendment to the Neutrality Act by Pittman, in our psychological imagination, is more harmful than beneficial to China. However, we think from another perspective that if this measure is implemented, then we will not have any goods shipped to Japan, and Japan will have no goods shipped to the United States. This measure will certainly end the Sino-Japanese War sooner. Mrs. Fitch then urged the US government to take action quickly to sanction aggressive countries. She said that if Congress is unwilling to do so, then she would rather support Pittman's proposal, but the Far Eastern issue should be dealt with separately and not confused with the whole. She believes that if the United States can economically sanction Japan, the United States will not be in danger of being dragged into the vortex of war, but if the United States still does not stop fueling the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis, then it may be dragged into the vortex of war. Mrs. Fitch further requested the House Foreign Affairs Committee to request assistance to China's sacred war of resistance. She said that people in New York have submitted a request to the government for assistance to China, and at that time, 175,000 people signed it. The Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously expressed its approval after listening to Mrs. Fitch's report. Illinois Democrat Ellen asked Mrs. Fitch, "If the United States refuses to sell gasoline, pig iron, and other military supplies to Japan, will Japan buy goods from the Dutch East Indies and other places?" Mrs. Fitch replied, "Japan's economic position is now extremely dangerous and it can no longer obtain credit loans in any country." (Associated Press dispatch, 25th)

### Dispute Over Oil Rights on North Sakhalin Island: Japan Lodges Protest with the Soviet Union

(Tokyo) Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Sawada invited Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Smirnov to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday afternoon to protest against the Soviet Union's pressure on Japan's oil and coal concession rights on North Sakhalin Island, saying that hindering the smooth operation of Japan's legitimate business on North Sakhalin Island is contrary to the fundamental terms of the existing treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union. He also asked the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires to convey to the Soviet government the Japanese government's request that the Soviet Union guarantee the protection of Japanese oil extraction and mining operations from May to October and that they will not be interfered with. Sawada also mentioned the provisions in the treaty that stipulate that raw materials imported by oil extraction and miners should not be subject to taxation, and that the Soviet government should provide all possible protection and assistance to Japanese enterprises.

### Japan Plans to Return Part of the Mandated Islands in the South Seas to Germany: German-Japanese Alliance in the Making, Tokyo Vigorously Promotes Participation in the War

(Paris) A relatively conservative newspaper here today paid close attention to the report that Japan has decided to return some of its vassal islands in the Pacific to Germany, so that warships of Germany and Japan can have strong bases. The newspaper said that Guam, owned by the United States, is now in a key position, but if German warships appear in the Micronesian islands, the situation will change. As for Britain and France, they cannot ignore this possibility. Once something changes in some part of the world, they also have their predetermined policies. (Associated Press dispatch, 25th)

(London) According to The Times' Berlin correspondent, no information has been obtained from official sources regarding the German-Japanese negotiations to transform the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance. If Hitler announces on Friday that the Japanese fleet will not remain neutral when Germany is at war with democratic countries, it will undoubtedly be a great success for Hitler. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

(Tokyo) Tokyo's "Kokumin Shimbun" published an editorial today discussing the impact of the European situation on the Far East, strongly arguing that the Japanese government should recognize the current situation, that Britain is now pursuing a policy of encircling the German-Italian-Japanese axis and has the support of the Soviet Union and China. Under this situation, Japan must earnestly carry out the anti-communist war. Japan participated in World War I because of the Anglo-Japanese alliance, so why shouldn't it take active steps today because of the anti-communist agreement? (Haitong dispatch, 25th)

### White House Prepares to Host the King and Queen of England: Envoys from Czechoslovakia and Albania Also Invited to Participate

(Washington) It is heard that the State Department plans to hold a special reception at the White House in June when the King and Queen of England visit Washington. Foreign guests who are invited to participate at that time include Czech Minister to the United States Hurban and Albanian Minister Koniça. Diplomatic circles here believe that the invitation of the envoys from Czechoslovakia and Albania is another indication that the United States refuses to recognize Germany's actions in the Czech Republic and Italy's actions in Albania.

### Amidst European Tensions, Hong Kong Strengthens Military Preparations: Army, Navy, and Air Force Actively Expand Outer Defenses and Construct Fortifications

A Hong Kong dispatch reports that, given the recent tensions in Europe, Hong Kong, as a British territory, will inevitably be drawn into the conflict should a European war break out. Although the British government, in its effort to protect its territories, built the Singapore Naval Base years ago and deployed the Far East Fleet in the Pacific to provide remote support, Hong Kong's limited territory means its local defense capabilities are only now being organized. Moreover, the distance to the Singapore Naval Base by sea is quite far. This small island, while commercially a major hub in the Far East, has historically had minimal military defenses. Recently, with the expansion of Japanese influence into Hainan Island and the Spratly Islands, the British Far East shipping lanes are under increasing threat, and Hong Kong is imperceptibly within its sphere of influence. In response, the Hong Kong government is urgently expanding its self-defense capabilities. Recently, no effort has been spared in training local air forces, organizing air defenses, supplying the navy, and fortifying the army along the Kowloon border. Hong Kong Island relies on the navy for outer perimeter defense, while the island's gun emplacements have been strengthened. Defensive fortifications have also been increased along the Kowloon border. Over the past few months, new-style fortifications have been built near the terminus of the British section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. Key intersections are being fortified with barbed wire. From Shenzhen to Tai Po and Sha Tin stations, the fortifications along major roads and minor paths are largely complete. The British section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is the only transportation lifeline connecting British Kowloon to the occupied areas of the mainland. Therefore, the Hong Kong government is paying close attention to the land defenses along this route.

Since its exercises in Singapore, the British Far East Fleet has reorganized its Far East defenses. British warships stationed in Hong Kong waters have successively returned to defend, totaling more than twenty ships. One aircraft carrier is stationed, and recently two shallow-draft gunboats, named Flying Dragon and Mantis, have arrived in Hong Kong. Each boat weighs 585 tons. In addition, there is one coastal defense ship, making the force stronger than before. To facilitate the British Navy's supply needs in Hong Kong, the British government has issued the Hong Kong Naval Volunteer Ordinance from London. The ordinance stipulates that the British Admiralty can directly accept warships maintained at the Hong Kong government's expense. If warships are jointly maintained with other colonies, the latter's consent is required. Whether serving at sea or on land, within or outside Hong Kong, volunteer officers and soldiers must comply with the regulations temporarily in force for the strict enforcement of naval discipline. The volunteer corps can be assigned to any warship, agency, or other place outside Hong Kong for service and training. In times of emergency, they can join naval service, be incorporated into the naval reserve or the naval volunteer reserve, or a portion can be incorporated into the naval reserve and a portion into the naval volunteer reserve. The British Admiralty can assist the Hong Kong government in dispatching officers and soldiers to naval service.

Recently, the Hong Kong Air Force has also been approved by the British government to conduct its own training. The training is based on the original Far East Aviation School. To date, the school has produced many talented pilots, some of whom will serve locally. The British Air Ministry also plans to strengthen Hong Kong's air defenses, with the Air Ministry transferring several squadrons of first-line aircraft for permanent stationing in Hong Kong. Aircraft replacements will be supplied by Australian and British aircraft factories. Air defense facilities in Hong Kong and Kowloon have recently been implemented separately. Anti-aircraft guns are being deployed at strategically important points, and the surrounding defensive fortifications are also being completed successively. Hong Kong and Kowloon have been divided into 22 air defense zones. An air raid shelter is being planned and built on the newly reclaimed land in Wan Chai so that residents can have a place of refuge in case of emergency. Each air defense zone is training residents to form air defense teams. The organization of air defense teams is divided into rescue teams, decontamination teams, police teams, transportation teams, fire brigades, and air defense observers. Air raid sirens have been installed in suitable areas. Recently, seven new ones were purchased and are being installed in residential areas. Several blackout drills were conducted last month, and a drill will be held soon without prior notice. Residents must turn off their lights as soon as they hear the air raid siren, and public streetlights must also be automatically controlled. When the all-clear signal is issued, the city's lights will return to normal. (April 19)

### Chinese Army Counterattacks Between Jiangsu and Shandong, Transitioning to an Epoch-Making Situation: Strong Military Force, Officers, and Soldiers Enthusiastically Following Orders, Adopting a Unified Stance to Launch Mobile Warfare

A dispatch from Taixian reports that since the arrival of a fresh Chinese force in the Jiangsu-Shandong war zone earlier this month, together with the original armies, the military strength has increased significantly. After consultations between senior generals, the various units were reorganized, and soon, a stable deployment was achieved. In accordance with the central government's designated strategy, a general counteroffensive has begun throughout the country. Southern Shandong and Northern Jiangsu are adopting a unified stance, launching large-scale mobile warfare. All heroic soldiers and armed civilians are enthusiastically following orders in this great spring, vowing to kill the enemy to the death. In just a few days, they have achieved glorious results that break records. The recent combat situation on various lines in Jiangsu Province is described below.

Creating an Enemy in Southern Shandong

When a fresh Chinese army began to move towards the Jiangsu-Shandong border, the Japanese army felt threatened and also increased its troops from Jiaodong to invade southward, attempting to strike first. However, the Chinese armies, having experienced many battles, have built strong defensive fortifications in the southern Shandong area. At the same time, they are also conducting guerrilla warfare in support. Therefore, as soon as the two armies came into contact, the Japanese army was defeated one by one. More than 2,000 Japanese and puppet troops led by Zhang Yun initially invaded west from Zhucheng. In the Zhigou area, they were attacked day and night by the Chinese army and were utterly defeated. The Japanese and puppet troops suffered about a hundred casualties, and the Chinese army captured forty or fifty Japanese and puppet officers and soldiers, dozens of mules and horses, and a large number of infantry guns, artillery, and ammunition. The remaining Japanese and puppet troops fled back to Zhucheng in disarray. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory and pursued them, and has now surrounded Zhucheng, preparing to annihilate them. In the Anqiu area, the Japanese army increased its troops to invade southward. In the Linwu, Shibu, and Shenliuzhuang areas, they also encountered a head-on blow from a large Chinese army. After a fierce battle for half a day, many Japanese soldiers were killed, and their corpses littered the field. The Japanese army's morale was low, and they retreated in defeat. On the 5th, the Japanese army reinforced with two or three hundred infantry and artillery soldiers, covered by eight vehicles, to counterattack. After the Chinese army confronted them and attacked from the flanks, they suffered another heavy blow and collapsed towards Fushan and retreated to Linqu. The Japanese army invading south also attacked Jiangyu, where they were severely attacked by the Chinese army. Although the Japanese army continued to reinforce, they attacked Daguan again. The Chinese army then launched a surprise attack, attacking from three sides. The battle was fierce, and the Chinese army followed one another and fought fiercely in hand-to-hand combat. The Japanese army could not withstand it and began to collapse across the board. The bodies of the dead were piled up, and the Chinese army seized military supplies that could not be counted. The Japanese army in Lintan also moved south and encountered a strong Chinese force, suffering heavy losses and unable to invade south. They have now been monitored and surrounded by the Chinese army and are about to be annihilated. The Chinese army in southern Shandong is now divided into various important strategic areas and defends the mountains and highways. In addition, the folk customs of southern Shandong are tough, and the Red Spear Society and the People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps are everywhere. Shen Honglie, chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, has also established the governments of eight counties in southern Shandong separately. Commissioners and county heads are working hard to mobilize the masses to cooperate with the regular army and participate in the war of resistance. Therefore, the combat achievements in this area have gradually restored the glorious continuation of the great battle of southern Shandong last year.

Combat Situation in Huaibei

Since the entry of a strong Chinese force into Huaibei at the end of last month, it has coordinated with the standing teams and people's self-defense corps in various counties, and constantly engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese and puppets. In particular, in the area of Huishu, Gaogou, and Tanggou in Lianshui County, the fierce battles with the Japanese and puppets were the most intense. They killed a large number of stubborn enemies, and then covered the masses to destroy the Huaihai, Zhenghai, and Huaixu highways, making it impossible for the Japanese army's heavy weapons to travel. At the same time, Wang Huayun, the county head of Pixian, led the standing team and self-defense corps to recover Pixian County twice, killing twenty or thirty Japanese and puppets, capturing many prisoners, and seizing dozens of long and short guns and other military supplies and horses. Wang Dianhua, the county head of Siyang, supervised the standing team and self-defense corps, and organized thousands of armed civilians to engage in fierce battles with the Japanese and puppets many times in the area of Shijiazhuang, Zhuangjiatan, and Lujiazui on the north bank of Hongze Lake. They used the lake swamp area to launch guerrilla tactics, and the Japanese and puppet heavy weapons were unable to move. They were unable to take care of each other, and their communication was repeatedly cut off. Therefore, the Japanese and puppet casualties were particularly heavy, and the Japanese captain Suzuki Saburo was killed, and a poison gas cannon and other military equipment were seized. The remaining Japanese and puppet troops retreated to Siyang and dared not go out again. County head Wang has reorganized his troops and presented them for approval to incorporate the armed civilians into the regular army, making the anti-war armed forces more substantial. Recently, he has counterattacked Siyang, approaching the suburbs. Lu Tongxuan, the county head of Suqian, has also established close contact with County head Wang, supervising his troops to counterattack Suqian, and destroying the Su-Si, Su-Shu, and Su-Sui highways, making it impossible for the Japanese and puppets to establish contact. Zhu Aizhou, the county head of Ganyu, has also organized his county's standing team and established a joint strike with the main army of southern Shandong. He is also launching a guerrilla war against the Japanese and puppets.

Attacking Lianghuai

Since the beginning of the month, the Chinese army attacking Lianghuai has moved to the suburbs of Huai. There are often five or six hundred to a thousand Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Huaiyin City, and they are often rotated. There are about five or six hundred Japanese soldiers in Huai'an. The city has a large outline and very high walls. The Japanese army has erected cannons and machine guns at various gates, and the defense is quite strict. In the initial attack, the Chinese army approached the west gate of Huaiyin and climbed the city with cloud ladders. The Japanese army used its fierce artillery fire to exert strong pressure and failed to break through. Later, the Chinese army recovered Banzha between Huai'an and Huaiyin, destroyed the highway, and cut off the Japanese army's communication. The Japanese army in Lianghuai stubbornly defended the isolated city and dared not go out. The Chinese army then attacked several times, and the Japanese army resisted stubbornly. The Chinese army then bombarded the city with artillery fire and destroyed the power plant. The Japanese army still stubbornly refused to fight. The Chinese army then cut off the highways around Huai, making it impossible for them to pass heavy weapons and unable to get reinforcements. Huaiyin is also under the close surveillance of the Chinese army. The Chinese army is openly active in the suburbs, and the Japanese army does not dare to leave the city a step.

Recovering Haimen

The various units in the Nantong Haimen area launched a general counteroffensive this week, starting simultaneously on the 12th from Jijiashi in the west to Qinglonggang in Qidong County in the east. The officers and soldiers were brave and their morale was extremely high. After only one or two nights of fierce fighting with the Japanese army, they successively recovered Jiangzaogang, Bachang, Qinglonggang, and Zhangzhizhen, and annihilated all the Japanese troops in the Dasheng Yarn Factory. The factory's machinery was also destroyed to prevent it from being used by the enemy again. At that time, the Japanese army generally retreated to Haimen Middle School in the northeast corner of the county seat, and one group retreated to Haimen City (the county has no city walls). The Chinese army attacked repeatedly for three consecutive nights on the 14th, 15th, and 16th, and officially recovered Haimen County on the 16th of this month. The remaining Japanese troops fled in panic. The Chinese army killed more than two hundred enemies and captured thirty or forty alive. The military supplies seized were piled up like mountains. On the same day, they also recovered Huidili (outside the south gate of Nantong). When the news of the Chinese army's victory reached the various lines, the morale of the army was even more excited, and they counterattacked the Japanese army. The momentum was like a broken bamboo. As for Rugao, the Chinese army's counterattack successively recovered Shizhuangzhen, Xinshenggang, and Niantuogang (all south of Rugao City), which are important strongholds. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, and the bodies of the dead littered the field. Rugao County is also surrounded by the Chinese army. As for the Japanese army in the Yangzhou-Shao area along the canal line, they are constantly attacked by the Chinese army, like startled birds. The Chinese army's positions on various lines are becoming more and more stable. In short, the war situation in northern Jiangsu has recently entered a new stage of dramatic times.

### The Zhengjin Bank in Guangzhou Was Robbed: The Result of the Japanese Army's Indiscriminate Support of Bandits; Bandits Killed a Bank Employee

A dispatch from Hong Kong reports that after the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, it worked hard to search for gold, silver, and jewelry, oppress the people, and shelter gambling and drug trafficking. They were indifferent to local security, so the banditry in the urban area, although rampant, was ignored. Therefore, the bandit forces were cultivated in a formless way and gradually expanded. More than a dozen cases of robbery occur every day, and the entire city is almost a world of bandits. However, with the bandit forces flourishing, it is not only a scourge for the citizens, but also the Japanese are encountering its harm. For example, the robbery of the Guangzhou branch of Yokohama Zhengjin Bank is a manifestation of this. The Guangzhou branch of Yokohama Zhengjin Bank is located at 25 Xihaokou, the original site of the Jiaotong Bank. It specializes in absorbing the financial resources of the occupied areas as its only task. On the morning of the 10th of this month, at about 1:00 a.m., the bank was suddenly robbed by eight bandits who broke open the iron gate and entered the bank. After entering the bank, the bandits immediately frightened the bank employees into a corner. They then tilted the cabinets and overturned the boxes. At that time, a bank employee ran down from upstairs and drew his weapon to resist the bandits, but was shot dead by the bandits. The bandits searched for half an hour before escaping with their loot. Afterwards, a large Japanese army rushed to the scene, but the bandits had already disappeared without a trace. After the bank was robbed, the Japanese army headquarters sent twenty Japanese soldiers to guard it. The bank was closed for one day to investigate the losses from the robbery, but the amount robbed has not been officially announced.

### Current Status of National Primary Education: 320,000 Schools with 18 Million Students Before the War; Textbooks and Teaching Materials Have Been Revised and Recompiled After the War, and Other Matters Are Continuing

(Special dispatch from Chongqing) The Ministry of Education recently compiled detailed statistics on national primary education (including kindergartens, primary schools' higher and lower departments, simplified primary schools, and short-term primary schools) before and after the war. The following is a summary:

Pre-War Situation: National Primary Education in the 25th Year Before the War (1) "Number of Schools": 1,283 kindergartens (872 public, 411 private), 244,398 primary schools (208,777 public, 35,621 private), 39,034 primary schools with both higher and lower grades (30,064 public, 8,970 private), 6,704 simplified primary schools (6,564 public, 140 private), 28,661 short-term primary schools (28,253 public, 408 private), totaling 320,080 schools. (2) "Number of Classes": A total of 559,534 classes in all kindergartens and schools (464,867 public). (3) "Number of Children": 79,827 in kindergartens, 11,179,998 in primary schools, 1,444,700 in the lower grades of higher and lower grades combined, 3,657,070 in the higher grades, 175,590 in simplified primary schools, and 182,777 in short-term primary schools, totaling 18,364,956 people (15,607,312 public), of which 3,548,878 were girls. (4) "Number of Teachers and Staff": 2,607 in kindergartens, 453,073 in primary schools, 196,624 in schools with both higher and lower grades, 8,023 in simplified primary schools, and 42,504 in short-term primary schools, totaling 702,831, of which 55,280 were women. (5) "Annual Expenditure": 1,091,459 for kindergartens, 53,205,42 for primary schools, 34,014,900 for the higher grades of schools with both higher and lower grades, 24,675,507 for the lower grades, 771,166 for simplified primary schools, and 5,967,160 yuan for short-term primary schools, totaling 119,725,603 yuan (94,718,339 public).

Post-War Status: The Ministry of Education is currently compiling the general situation of primary education in various provinces and cities after the war and has not yet completed the statistics. Regarding the primary school teachers and staff who withdrew from the battlefield, in addition to distributing 6,790 people to 11 provinces and 13 locations and placing 280 people in other educational institutions, 69 people were examined and employed as teachers and editors, and 1,402 people were assigned to serve in the middle and primary school teacher service corps in 8 locations. As for the primary education facilities of the Ministry of Education, several points can be mentioned:

(1) "Curriculum": Although the Ministry of Education has repeatedly promulgated the curriculum standards for primary schools and kindergartens, from temporary to revised, it has been seven years. There is no unchanging law in the world, and curriculum standards are not the same as the curriculum, but the standard that the curriculum can be based on. Therefore, concrete curricula still need to be compiled separately by the central and local governments. Those that are national in scope and can be used nationwide are compiled by the central government, and those that are local in scope and can be used specifically by each province, city, and county are compiled by the local government. Before the war, the Ministry of Education ordered various provinces and cities to formulate concrete curriculum examples, but unfortunately, only Jiangsu and other provinces compiled a part, which was not completed. Most of the provinces did not submit their papers. The Ministry of Education designated specialists to try to formulate a national concrete curriculum, but since the fall of Nanjing, the manuscripts were not taken out, resulting in loss. The Ministry of Education is still working on this task and hopes to continue to complete it.

(2) "Textbooks and Teaching Materials": (A) Review of textbooks: Since the revised curriculum standards, the books sent to the Ministry and transferred to the National Compilation and Translation Bureau by various bookstores have been revised and reviewed. Due to the current situation, this revision and review work has not been fully completed. (B) Editing of textbooks: Since the Ministry of Education specially assigned editors to compile more perfect primary school textbooks, before that, nine kinds of drafts had been completed for junior primary school Chinese, arithmetic, society, and nature, and senior primary school Chinese, arithmetic, history, geography, and nature. Later, a committee was formed to submit the usable drafts to the Compilation and Translation Bureau for review and revision. Those that were not usable were re-edited by experts. Before August 26, only the entire senior primary school Chinese, two volumes of junior primary school Chinese, one volume each of junior and senior primary school arithmetic, and one volume of senior primary school society were published. In the 27th year, the committee was reorganized, the policy was re-established, the completed drafts were revised or re-edited, and those that had not been completed were re-edited. Currently, most of the textbooks published by various bookstores do not meet the needs of the war of resistance, so supplementary teaching materials should be added, and editing has begun. (C) Sorting out other reading materials: Before, more than 2,000 books that could be read by primary school children were selected, divided into upper, middle, and lower grades. A children's book exhibition was held in Beijing, and it was planned to tour the provinces, but it was not sorted out, and the Children's Year Implementation Committee was closed. This will continue to be sorted out in the future. (D) Sorting out and editing music teaching materials: Before, three volumes of primary school music teaching materials were published, for use in the lower, middle, and upper grades of primary schools. Recently, the Music Committee was reorganized to actively engage in the compilation of music teaching materials for middle and primary schools. (E) Editing and revising textbooks for short-term primary schools: The results of the discussion at the Yi Education Cadre Training Class in the 25th year showed that the textbooks for short-term primary schools compiled in the 22nd year were mostly not applicable, so a new version was revised in May of the 26th year and completed in October. The content mixed and compiled Chinese and common sense. Common sense only had charts and no textbooks for reference when teaching. Chinese had both text and pictures, and strived to connect with common sense. It has now been published by major bookstores.

(3) "Moral Education": (A) In July of the 25th year, the primary school civic training standards were revised and promulgated, and all primary schools in the country can implement them accordingly. (B) Abolishing corporal punishment and removing all restrictions: Recently, previous orders have been reiterated and notified to be followed. (C) Paying attention to physical education and hygiene: Various implementation plans have been issued, and primary schools have been ordered to pay attention to increasing children's sleep time, wearing masks when sweeping the floor, and not assigning them to dangerous tasks such as emptying spittoons. The schools have also been ordered to pay attention to extracurricular sports, stipulating that there should be group activities and individual free activities every day, as well as morning exercises and interval exercises. (D) Promoting family education (methods will be published in this newspaper): The teaching materials for family education have now been compiled by the Ministry and will be distributed to the country soon.

(4) "Equipment": No standards have been set for school buildings, desks, chairs, and all equipment. However, there are regulations for teaching equipment, such as the equipment for the labor science department. There are also detailed regulations on school hygiene equipment. In the future, it is planned to pay special attention to this aspect of work.

(5) "Teachers and Staff": (A) In addition to stipulating the qualifications, treatment, and protection of primary school teachers and staff, the regulations on the examination of primary school teachers were revised and promulgated in December of the 25th year to rectify the teaching staff. (B) For the further study of primary school teachers and staff, the summer seminars in the 27th year focused on education laws and regulations, and in the 28th year, it is planned to focus on the implementation of education for the war of resistance. In addition, normal universities and education colleges of various universities are ordered to set up special primary school teacher auditing seats to facilitate further study. Normal universities and education colleges of various universities, and provincial and municipal departments and bureaus are first ordered to designate excellent normal schools and affiliated primary schools to run primary school teacher correspondence research offices, as institutions for further study and consultation for primary schools and kindergartens in various places.

(6) "Guidance and Research": Before, the Ministry proposed various research questions on curriculum, teaching equipment, education administration, etc., and issued orders for research. In the summer of the 26th year, the Ministry, based on the current education laws and regulations that primary schools across the country have not been able to fully comply with and implement, proposed 54 questions, pointed out the provisions of the laws and regulations one by one, and the points that should be paid attention to during the inspection, and compiled a handbook, which was distributed to various inspectors as a comparison book for inspecting primary schools. At the same time, it was also issued to various schools for reference and improvement. (In addition, there are various matters related to the Children's Year, and the relief of teachers and staff and refugee children, which are omitted.)

### Rugao Normal School Moves to Piancha: Full of Vigor; Utilizing a Special Environment to Strictly Train Young People

(Dispatch from Dongtai) Rugao Normal School was originally located at Maojiaqiao in Rugao City. After Principal Huang left the school in November of the 16th year, the school was suspended and no one was in charge. In February of the 27th year, the Department of Education ordered Jiang Yixuan, the school's director of teaching affairs, to return to the school to act as the principal and ordered him to prepare for the resumption of classes. Therefore, the school re-recruited students to attend classes on March 1 of last year. Unexpectedly, Rugao fell on March 19, and the students were dismissed and returned home. At that time, the school's accountant, Xu Chengyuan, returned to Ruian, Zhejiang, and the economy could not function, resulting in repeated decisions to plan the resumption of classes but it was impossible. Until October of last year, Jiang ran around Shanghai and Huai, and the Department of Education specially found a way to resolve the difficulties and decided to move the school to Piancha Town in the normal school district, first restoring a part of the junior high school, registering students on one hand, and procuring various school equipment on the other. Classes began on February 25 of this year, and student registration procedures were handled, and classes began on March 1. Jiang has more than ten years of experience serving in provincial schools in Jiangsu and Anhui, and utilizes the existing special environment to train students to become talents suitable for current needs. He is extremely strict with education and management, so although the resumption time is short, the results are already considerable. Recently, Zhang Yi, a senior official of Jiangsu Province, passed through the town and visited the school. He believed that the school was able to maintain its original career with very little funding and had achieved such results, which was quite interesting. He then expressed to Jiang that he was very happy to support the school in terms of materials and spirit. It is now heard that the school plans to set up a senior high school department in the next semester, which is truly good news for young people in northern Jiangsu who have lost their senior high school education.

### Primary School Principals Association: Standing Committee Meeting to Prepare for Teacher's Day Celebration

The Shanghai Primary School Principals Association, established for many years, recently, with over 600 private primary schools in the two concessions, is making great efforts to expand its organization and strengthen unity by promoting the work of the council.

### Love is the Key Element of a Happy Life

In our lives, reason is naturally very precious. A child makes many bad things because they lack reason. As long as his parents, who are responsible for education, try to cultivate his reason, bad behaviors will be reduced. However, an adult, in addition to needing reason, also needs love. If he is too rational, he will become a cold person, and people who encounter him will inevitably be criticized for being eccentric! This kind of person lacks some emotions, but he still needs love. Because love is enough to nourish him, encourage him, and beautify and fulfill the content of his life. Therefore, Westerners say: "A happy life must be led by reason and encouraged by love." This is not bad at all.

We only need to look at a man who has lost love. He will feel how disheartened, how dull and lonely his life is. He is simply bored with everything, and sometimes he even commits suicide because of this! Indeed, love is an indispensable element in our lives. Without love, there can be no happy life. This is why young men and women regard love as a second life. However, love is not a rare treasure, but a common occurrence. Once an energetic and strong man marries a healthy and beautiful woman, they will surely have deep love and be happier than flying. They will give birth to clever children and form a happy family. Isn't this very common? Why should a dignified man be abandoned by a woman and fall into the miserable situation of unrequited love? Although there are many reasons for this, most of them must be due to the man's early self-gratification and nocturnal emission or post-marital debauchery and excessive indulgence and worrying labor. In terms of innate function, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin sperm infertility, neurasthenia, and other symptoms erupt, then he is both sallow and thin, and his appearance is not attractive and cannot arouse women's love. Even in marital life, it will inevitably be unsatisfactory, hated by his wife, and even past love will be destroyed once. Therefore, all kinds of tragedies are staged in the family, then how miserable will his life be!

Smart husbands who want to remedy the situation must fundamentally cure their diseases. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the gonadotropin preparation "Shengzhisu" is the most effective treatment. Because this agent can produce sperm to nourish the kidneys, invigorate the brain and activate blood, and nourish the nerves after taking it for one day and night, and if you continue to take it, it will definitely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and it can also prolong life and rejuvenate. Only those with nocturnal emission need to take "Himitotsu Spermostatic Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate and prevent leakage, so that both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, and the effect will be quick. If patients can come to this clinic in person and be diagnosed by expert doctors, and use various scientific therapies such as electrotherapy, injection, and surgery, they can be guaranteed to be cured.

### Nocturnal Emission and Self-Gratification are No Different from Severing One's Own Vitality

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Who among the young people who are in the city full of sexual temptation can not be moved by it? The fear of venereal disease viruses makes him not have the courage to prostitute, but the sexual depression is unbearable, so he has to settle for masturbation. It is so pitiful to say! But once masturbation is committed, it is easy to develop bad habits and indulge in it. Over time, the sperm gate is loosened, and sometimes you have a nocturnal emission while dreaming of romance, and sometimes unconsciously, or when you see a woman's color, or when the local area is accidentally in contact with clothes and pants, you have lewd thoughts, and there is seminal fluid leaking out. Day after day, the source of life flows outward, how can your flesh and blood body not be exhausted and give birth to all kinds of diseases. Therefore, symptoms such as mental weakness, insomnia, forgetfulness, headache, flatulence, low ambition, difficulty in thinking, back pain, kidney deficiency, and scattered energy are successively followed. Not only are these young people unsuccessful in academics and careers because of multiple illnesses and pains, but they are also impoverished for life. They will inevitably be unsatisfactory in the marital life that is indispensable in life, hated by their wives, and all kinds of tragedies will be staged in the family, or there will be no children, causing lifelong regrets! In addition, there are many cases of premature aging and early death due to the exhaustion of vitality!

The most effective treatment for spermatorrhea. At this time, it is only reliable to take "Himitotsu Spermostatic Tablets", because this agent can consolidate the sperm gate and calm the nerves after taking it, and spermatorrhea can be cured. If the above symptoms have been caused by spermatorrhea, you must also take the gonadotropin preparation "Shengzhisu" to cultivate the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you continue to take it, the above symptoms can also be cured early. If patients can come to this clinic in person and use various scientific therapies such as electrotherapy, injection, and surgery, they can be guaranteed to be cured.

### Breasts are an Important Weapon in Winning the Love Arena

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

The spring breeze blows the ridges. Butterflies fly in pairs. Today, when the weather is gradually warming up, who wants to put on the bulky and hateful cotton clothes again, so everyone - especially young girls in their prime, in thin, light shirts and soft wind, show their vitality and health more and more. Indeed, a woman with a graceful appearance, full of blood, with a pair of agile peaks erected in front of her chest, standing side by side, with a peach blossom-like smile on her face, a slender body, curvy, and graceful, is not this comparable to the beautiful spring scenery, graceful and moving? Because the breasts of this kind of woman are well developed, the ovarian function must be healthy, and there are no hidden diseases. Not only in the social arena, she is loved by her lover as a fairy, but also after marriage, she is regarded as a treasure by her husband, and love is more profound. She organizes a happy family and gives birth to clever children. This is so happy and gratifying!

But I have to say, if a woman's ovarian function is destroyed due to early chest binding, self-gratification, leucorrhea, anemia, irregular menstruation, and severe diseases, which affects the metabolism, resulting in breast atrophy and loss of beauty, then even in this bright weather, under the thin shirt, the ugliness of 'the dagger is revealed' is even more obvious. As a result, she suffers the pain of unrequited love in the love arena, and after marriage, she is often regarded as a useless thing by her husband, and there is no happiness at all! The only remedy: According to world-renowned gynecologists and my experience, only taking the ovarian preparation for women "Shengzhisu" is the most effective and effective treatment. Because this agent is made from the essence of the ovaries of young and strong animals, it can cultivate the ovarian function, promote metabolism, adjust menstruation, warm the uterus, and stop the discharge one day and night after taking it. If you continue to take it, it is guaranteed to make the breasts towering, the cheeks ruddy, and improve health and beauty in a short period of time.

### Easily Cured Gonorrhea

Acute leucorrhea is unbearable for patients because of the pain, and it is the first time they have encountered it, and they do not know what to do. In fact, this kind of acute gonorrhea is not as dangerous as the patient feels when in pain. Not only is it not a dangerous symptom, but it is also an easily treated symptom. Patients should remain calm and quickly ask a doctor who is experienced, fully equipped, and willing to be responsible for treatment, so that they can be completely cured within seven or eight days. The biggest difficulty of acute leucorrhea is whether the doctor can be responsible for thoroughly treating the patient, and whether the patient can take care of themselves and discard bad drugs. If you are careful in choosing a doctor and taking care of yourself, it is the easiest way for patients to get rid of the pain of gonorrhea. Patients must pay attention! .

Patients develop symptoms on the third or fourth day after unclean sexual intercourse. Body temperature rises to 37-38 degrees, the glans penis is swollen, the foreskin is everted, and there is a mixture of pus and blood, and urination is unusually difficult. For the treatment of acute leucorrhea, I first use a special vaccine and the most advanced chemotherapy. At the same time, I also use the German "Filtrin" laminar electrotherapy and cooling methods, etc., to create an antitoxic effect in the body, quickly destroy the raging gonorrhea, and stop the inflammation from being fierce. Therefore, it can stop the pain on the same day, clear turbidity and reduce inflammation in three days, and be completely cured in a week. It has been tried and tested, and experts in European and Western countries have recently become very interested in this kind of therapy, and more and more people are using it. All famous venereal disease hospitals use it. The reason is that its performance is excellent, and the cure rate of acute gonorrhea accounts for more than 90%.

### Repeated Obstruction of Foreign Ships: Japan's Attempt to Monopolize Shipping; British Merchants Unyielding, Fully Maintaining Services: Japanese Ships Already Took the Top Spot This Year

Since Japanese warships blockaded our coastal areas, they have obstructed the passage of foreign ships from various countries, arbitrarily inspected them, and illegally detained them, attempting to monopolize coastal shipping. Although negotiations by consuls of the countries concerned have been ineffective, they are now using the pretext of military operations to prevent foreign ships from sailing to various ports in Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and northern Jiangsu, where our troops are defending. Details are recorded as follows:

Japan's Promotion of Shipping in China

Japan is making every effort to expand its shipping business in China, squeeze out foreign merchants, and attempt to monopolize it. In addition to the Shanghai-Qingdao, Shanghai-Dalian, and Shanghai-Tianjin routes, Japanese companies have opened new Shanghai-Xiamen routes and expanded inland routes, such as the Xiao Hai-Chongming line, the Shanghai-Tiansheng Port line, and the Shanghai-Xin Port line. The Dalian Steamship Company of Japan specializes in routes such as Shanghai-Qingdao-Dalian-Tianjin. The Osaka Merchant Shipping Co., Ltd. of Japan specializes in routes such as Shanghai-Xiamen-Keelung. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha specializes in routes such as Nagasaki-Kobe and various parts of Europe. In addition, the so-called Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company specializes in inland river routes in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.

Inspection and Detention of Foreign Merchant Ships

There are countless instances of ships of foreign merchants sailing to various ports in China being unreasonably inspected by the Japanese side. As for those detained until released on the pretext of unclear nationality: (1) Portuguese merchant ships such as Tang Bei, Tang Qiao, Tang Lu, Mei Da, Hai Long, Li Bin, Da De, Lu De, Bin De, Fu Lu, Kang Bo, Tian Ma, Ma Li, etc.; (2) Greek merchant ships Ya Sheng, Li Wu Duo, Si Ba Du; (3) Hungarian merchant ship Ai Da; (4) Panamanian merchant ship Chi Kan; (5) Norwegian merchant ships Gong Gong, Sai Wei Ke. The total number of merchant ships detained has reached more than twenty. Some are currently berthed in Shanghai or Taiwan, all under the surveillance of Japanese troops, and all ships have lost their freedom.

Using Military Pretexts to Obstruct Navigation

The coastal ports where Chinese troops are stationed include Ningbo, Haimen, and Wenzhou in Zhejiang; Fuzhou, Xinghua, and Quanzhou in Fujian; Shantou in Guangdong; Funing in northern Jiangsu; and areas controlled by guerrillas, such as the ports of Qidong and Haimen. Today, Japanese warships are arbitrarily inspecting foreign ships entering and leaving the waters off these ports, and using the pretext of military operations to prevent foreign ships from sailing to the above ports. For example, the Binli ship of the Italian Yihua Foreign Firm was blocked outside Wenzhou; the Deyao ships on the Beisha line have temporarily suspended sailing to Qidong and Haimen; and the Yongzhen and other ships were forced to suspend sailing on the Funing route in northern Jiangsu. The Nantong-Tiansheng Port line is exclusively navigated by Japanese merchants.

British Merchants Maintain Routes in China

The ships of the British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson companies have always focused on sailing the north and south ocean lines and the Yangtze River routes along the Chinese coast. Now, due to Japanese obstruction, the shipping industry has been greatly affected. However, in order to maintain the original routes in China, it has been decided to spare no sacrifice. All lines will continue to send ships to sail. For example, although Jardine Matheson's Yihe ship received a notice from a Japanese warship not to sail to Beisha, the ship still sailed and decided to request protection from British warships if necessary. In addition, routes such as Shanghai-Tianjin, Shanghai-Zhejiang, Shanghai-Fujian, and Shanghai-Shantou are still sending ships on schedule. Currently, navigation has been suspended due to a sharp decline in passengers and cargo, and Japanese obstruction.

Extreme Decline of Shipping in Various Countries

The shipping industry in China of various countries has been extremely weakened by Japanese exclusion. Governments of various countries attach great importance to this. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from customs officials yesterday that comparing the number of ships entering and leaving various customs ports from January to last month, Japan has jumped to the first place, with 981 ships, 1,592,038 tons. The United Kingdom has fallen to second place, with 563 ships, 1,553,710 tons. Norwegian ships are in third place, with 151 ships, 310,738 tons. German ships are in fourth place, with 54 ships, 268,433 tons. Dutch ships are in fifth place, with 42 ships, 185,336 tons. American ships are in sixth place, with 20 ships, 116,841 tons.

### The Situation in Eastern Zhejiang Remains Tense; Resumption of Navigation Unlikely in the Short Term; Japanese Warships and Aircraft Continue to Harass; Hana Requests Resumption of Shanghai-Dinghai Route

Since the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Command ordered the prohibition of navigation in the Oujiang estuary of Wenzhou on the 23rd, the foreign ships originally sailing on that line are now temporarily berthed in Shanghai and have telegraphed Wenzhou to inquire about the situation. However, the situation in eastern Zhejiang is still extremely tense, and there is no hope of resuming navigation on the Oujiang River for the time being. The Ende ship, which was staying in Ningbo, was inspected by a Japanese warship en route to Ningbo. The ship has been changed to sail to Shanghai today. The situation in Ningbo is still peaceful. Details of various situations are recorded below:

Various Ships Suspend Sailing and Telegraph to Inquire About the Truth

Since Japanese warships and aircraft carried out wanton harassment in the Oujiang River in Wenzhou on the 22nd, the situation in eastern Zhejiang has suddenly become tense. In order to strengthen defense, the Chinese military authorities ordered the prohibition of navigation in and out of the Oujiang River by the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Command on the 23rd, and announced the blockade of traffic. The British ships Haiyang and Yingzhou, and the German ship Moufu, which were staying in Wenzhou, have all left the Oujiang River and sailed to Hong Kong and Shanghai. The German ship Deping, the German ship Haifu, Hana, and other ships sailing to Wenzhou have also turned back one after another. The Italian ship Baoli, which was blocked in the Wuli waters, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. All ships are now berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf at the 16th Pier. The goods loaded on board are temporarily not unloaded, so that the ships can still sail to Wenzhou when the situation eases slightly. Yesterday, the Sino-Italian Shipping Company also telegraphed Wenzhou to inquire about the truth, but no reply has been received by late evening, so all ships have temporarily suspended sailing and do not intend to change to other lines before receiving definite news.

Tense Situation Makes Resumption Difficult

A reporter from the Modern News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the Haifu ship office of the German Lihe Foreign Firm in Shanghai received a telegram from Wenzhou yesterday, stating that the Japanese warship had bombarded the Huanghuaguan Fortress again the day before yesterday (the 24th), and the garrison immediately returned fire. At the same time, Japanese aircraft flew over the urban area and dropped incendiary bombs. The detailed situation was only briefly mentioned in the telegram and was not described in detail. It also stated that the situation in eastern Zhejiang is still extremely tense, and the blockade of the Oujiang River has not been blocked, but it is feared that there is no hope of resuming navigation for the time being. It was also learned that General Commander Huang of the 10th Army Corps and Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province have ordered the garrison troops to be on strict alert. If the Japanese invade, they will resolutely strike head-on.

Hana Requests Resumption of Shanghai-Dinghai Route

Since the ports of Dinghai, Jiaojiang, Yongjiang, and Oujiang, which are open to traffic in eastern Zhejiang, have been blockaded one after another, traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang has been completely cut off. People from Dinghai, fearing that the lack of food in their hometown will endanger the people's food supply, have requested the resumption of Shanghai-Dinghai shipping in order to provide relief. At the same time, the German Far East Shipping Company has also requested the Ningbo Defense Command to allow the Hana ship to sail on the Shanghai-Dinghai line in order to maintain traffic. According to news from the company, the request is still awaiting approval. The rumor that the ship will sail to Dinghai tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is incorrect.

Ende Telegrams to Sail to Shanghai Today

The Ende ship of the Sino-Italian Shipping Company, after loading wheat and sailing to Ningbo, was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday. The company received a telegram from the ship yesterday, stating that the situation in Ningbo is peaceful. Ende has changed to leave at 4:00 p.m. on the 26th due to insufficient loading, and will return directly to Shanghai, arriving in port tomorrow morning. It was also learned that the ship was prevented from sailing by a Japanese warship on the way from Shanghai to Ningbo, in the waters off the Longshan County under the jurisdiction of Zhenhai. A Japanese officer and a Taiwanese interpreter boarded the ship to inspect it, and pointed out that the ship belonged to Chinese merchants and intended to detain it. The Italian mate Bianco received the officer and explained that the ship had been transferred to Italian merchants and held an Italian certificate. The Japanese soldiers had no choice but to entangle for two hours before retreating. The ship then sailed into the Yongjiang River.

Shanghai-Zhejiang Postal Remittances

Received and Sent as Usual

According to another report from the Modern News Agency to the Postal Administration, since the Oujiang River was blockaded a few days ago, regarding postal remittances between Shanghai and Zhejiang, in addition to large packages and printed matter, etc., heavy mail that is inconvenient to transport, the rest, such as ordinary letters, express letters, registered letters, remittances, etc., are still being maintained and delivered as usual by the post office in order to facilitate the public. However, due to the blockage of shipping in eastern Zhejiang, the postal route will be temporarily changed to Fuzhou for transfer. Although the time will be slightly delayed, it will never be interrupted.

### French Concession Police Returned National Flags Yesterday Morning; Taxpayers Sent Personnel to Count and Retrieve Them; Totaling 226 National Flags

The case of the French Concession interfering with the county flag was settled, and the taken national flags were returned by the French Concession police yesterday morning after two negotiations by Qu Zhenhua, the representative of the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession. The association and Du Yuesheng's mansion both received notices from the French Consulate the night before last, stating that the taken national flags would be returned the next morning. Taxpayer Zeng then sent Secretary Guo Shuliang to various police stations such as Lujiawan yesterday morning to retrieve the national flags. A total of 226 flags were retrieved: 70 from the Lujiawan police station, 102 from the Xiafei Road police station, and 54 from the Gongguan Road police station. When Secretary Guo retrieved the flags from various police stations yesterday morning, the police chiefs of each police station solemnly returned them and asked Secretary Guo to count them one by one, which was quite solemn. According to news from the Taxpayers Association, the various merchants or citizens whose national flags were taken are requested to report to the association in writing within three days, and then the association will send personnel to return them. It is rumored that when Qu visited the French Consul General yesterday, he also mentioned the matter of not interfering with the county flag in the future, but there were no specific results. The Chinese Taxpayers Association believes that since the case has been formally negotiated with the French Ambassador by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it should wait for the overall solution.

### Wang Jingwei's Ambitions Not Yet Extinguished; Preparing to Organize a "Peace and National Salvation Army"; Establishing Secret Agencies in Shanghai and Actively Engaging in Activities; Attempting to Induce Guerrilla Forces to Participate in Reorganization

Modern News Agency reports: Since traitor Wang Jingwei colluded with a certain party, made a secret agreement, and advocated the fallacy of seeking peace without authorization, not hesitating to destroy the war of resistance and sell out the nation, the whole country has been unanimously indignant. The central government, with magnanimity, considered his past history and only expelled him from the party in the hope of prompting him to reflect. But the traitor's ambitions are not yet extinguished, and he does not know how to repent. He has recently secretly sent his cronies to Shanghai to engage in activities. In addition to preparing to organize propaganda agencies such as the "Far East Daily" and the "Republic News Agency," attempting to spread rumors and numb the people, he also plans to organize a so-called "Peace National Army." It is rumored that he has set up a secret liaison agency in a certain hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, with expenses provided by a certain party. He has been sending his henchmen everywhere to win over and attempt to induce guerrilla forces in various places to defect and participate in the reorganization, hoping that his military talisman will be fulfilled. It is rumored that the leaders of guerrilla forces in various places are all filled with righteousness and deeply hate Jiang traitor's absurd behavior, so they are not used for peace. Wang traitor's progress is now deeply troubled, and it is expected that this conspiracy will be completely crushed.

### Shanghai City Grain Reserves Slightly Reduced; Totaling More Than 650,000 Bags

The Shanghai Municipal Grain Evaluation Committee conducted its fourth survey of grain reserves, totaling 652,456 bags, a decrease of 1,631 bags compared to the third survey. The China Bank warehouse is still in first place, with 123,613 bags. The East and West warehouses of Zhejiang Industrial Bank are in second place, with 104,312 bags. The China Industrial Bank warehouse is in third place, with 51,832 bags. The results have been reported to the Seven Rice Industry Groups and the authorities of the two concessions for their reference. The fifth survey has already begun and is expected to be completed in early next week. In addition, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, in view of the fact that the market bushels used by the industry have not been calibrated for a long time, which may lead to some discrepancies, has decided to calibrate the market bushels for the sake of unification. It is scheduled to be held at the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange at 9:00 a.m. on the 30th.

### Chinese Troops on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line Respond to Counter-Offensive Strategy; More Than 20 Meters of Railway Tracks Destroyed Near Wangting; A Steel Bridge Near Kunshan Also Blown Up; More Than 30 Japanese Soldiers Annihilated at the Fanhwangdu

According to sources in the transportation industry, since last week, the Chinese troops on the Nanjing-Shanghai line have responded to the counter-offensive and taken advantage of the Japanese army's deployment along the line to carry out major activities. Their area has advanced to the countryside five or six miles away from the transportation arteries, posing a threat to the Japanese army at any time. On the 24th of this month, about 20 meters of railway tracks near Wangting Station in Wuxi were destroyed, causing the Nanjing-Shanghai train to be delayed for an hour.

Kunshan

In the early morning of the 25th, a small steel bridge about three miles away from Kunshan Station was also blown up. After the Japanese army discovered it, they ordered road workers to repair it before traffic could be restored. Therefore, the Japanese army along the line has been running around in recent days, and their situation is very difficult. The Japanese police guard team at Fanhwangdu Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line was suddenly attacked by guerrillas last night (the 24th). The confrontation lasted for three hours. More than 30 Japanese soldiers survived, and only a few survived. The rest were killed by the guerrillas. Two Japanese soldiers were captured alive, sent to the team for interrogation, and a Japanese army truck was destroyed. After achieving their goal, the guerrillas calmly retreated.

### Japanese Begin Bombing of the Huangpu River Blockade Line; More Than Ten Sunken Ships to Be Removed; Bombing Expected to Take Days; Aiming to Destroy Ships for Dock Repair

The North China Daily News reports: At the beginning of the war, the Chinese army placed a water fence across the Huangpu River between the Bund in Nanshi and Pudong. The Japanese side is scheduled to start bombing at 6:20 a.m. today (the 25th).

Start Bombing

The work will be divided into three periods, from 6:20 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., from 1:50 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., and from 5:40 p.m. to sunset. During this period, the water fence will be closed and navigation will not be allowed. The Japanese say they will try to remove several old ships and more than ten sailing boats that sank to the bottom of the river. Tomorrow (the 26th), bombing will continue from 6:40 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. and from 2:20 p.m. to sunset. It is expected that the bombing of the water fence

Will take several days of work, but it depends on the condition of the water fence and the weather conditions. If the weather is clear, it may take less than the expected six days. In early March last year, Japanese salvage experts came to Shanghai. At that time, a part of the water fence was opened, and it was discovered that the Japanese ships sunk to build the water fence were sunk on sailing boats loaded with Sambo soil. The current work is to remove the ships in the lower layer. This water fence

Although a part of it has been destroyed by bombing, ships such as Dalae Company and other ships are still unable to sail downstream for commercial shipping. Smaller ships can already pass. The Hongmen (translated meaning) ship, which has been blocked downstream of the water fence for more than a year, has been granted permission to sail downstream of the Huangpu River. The Japanese warships that were destroyed by artillery fire in the Yangtze River area a few months ago either sailed on their own or were towed by other ships to the Jiangnan Shipyard for repair.

### Customs Water Police Recovered Police Power in Punan; Result of Negotiations with the Japanese Side; One Japanese Officer Participated in the Patrol

It is heard that He Dafu, the Western Police Chief of the Customs Water Police, is now actively seeking to restore the inherent powers before the war. In addition to the police power in the Yangshupu-Hongkou area and the patrol power in the Suzhou River, which have been restored successively, he recently submitted a request to the Customs authorities to negotiate with the Japanese side to restore the police power in Punan, which has been obtained. Therefore, the patrol boats and patrol boats of the police station have begun to carry armed Chinese and Western police officers, and one Japanese officer participates, sailing to the Zhangjiagang area south of Nanhuangpu Xinlonghua, patrolling back and forth. For all police cases, they can exercise the power of arrest on the Punan section without any hindrance.

### Public Buses and Trams Increase Fare Per Mile; Public Utilities Committee Advocates; Company Expresses Agreement

The Public Utilities Committee and the Board of Directors of the Public Works Bureau recently considered whether the mileage fees paid by the Chinese Public Bus Company and the Tram Company are appropriate. Because the purchase price of road construction materials has more than doubled, and the weight and volume of public buses have increased, considering these facts, the previously set mileage fee schedule is obviously inappropriate. The amounts opened in the schedule are as follows:

Previously Agreed Fee Amount: 1.5 cents of silver per English mile for those equipped with pneumatic tires, equivalent to 2.09 cents in national currency; 2 cents in national currency per English mile for trackless trams with hard wheels; 1.7 cents in national currency per English mile for trackless trams with pneumatic tires. In addition, the tram company should take 1.25% of the total income of trackless trams and pay it to the Public Works Bureau as a business permit fee.

Current Weight: The current public buses in general use, including those that have been customized, have increased in weight by 22% compared to the original standard public buses if each bus has half the passengers. The body weight of the commonly used trackless tram is lighter than the original standard public bus. As for the average number of passengers on public buses, it has increased from 30 to 58.

Methods of Increasing Fees: The Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Bureau believes that based on the above facts, the mileage fees for public buses and trackless trams should be increased by 10% each, which is equal to the percentage of the additional vehicle license fee levied last year. As for public buses, due to the increase in weight and volume, the mileage fee should be increased by another 10%, totaling 20%, to be fair.

Company Agrees: The above methods of increasing mileage fees have been agreed to by the Tram Company and the Public Bus Company, and will be implemented from May 1. However, the Tram Company proposed one additional condition, that is, when the exchange rate of foreign currencies returns to the standard level, this issue should be reconsidered. The public buses of the French Tram Company, which operate in the north of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, will also pay the same increase in mileage fees. The company has expressed its agreement.

### Those Going to Yangshupu and Hongkou Need Epidemic Prevention Certificates

The North China Daily News reports: A spokesman for the Japanese Navy claimed yesterday (the 24th) when entertaining reporters that, starting tomorrow, anyone entering Yangshupu, Hongkou, and other Japanese-occupied areas must have a certificate of inoculation against epidemics. Any certificate that has been issued for half a year will be invalid. Most of the certificates issued in Yunian have expired.

### Zhenhai County Party Headquarters Petitions for Confiscation of Chuan Xiaochen's Property; Only Under Investigation and Not Confiscated; Still Not Enough to Appease Public Outrage

Since Chuan Xiao'an took the false position of "Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality," his residence and ancestral hall in his native Zhenhai were sealed up by the Zhenhai County Government on the orders of the Ningbo Defense Command in January. It is now learned that the Zhenhai Party Headquarters believes that only sealing up the property without confiscating it is not enough to appease public anger, and yesterday petitioned the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters to forward it to the Military Affairs Committee, stating:

Punishment Should Be Severe to Extend Discipline: I think that the foundation of a country is to attach importance to discipline first. If discipline is not maintained, the country will not be a country. The five thousand years of history of our China, and the glory of our culture, rely on the extension of discipline. The arduous and great undertaking of resisting the war and building the country at present depends on the praise of the Four Cardinal Principles and Eight Virtues. Therefore, rewarding loyalty should be generous, and punishment must be severe. In this way, the hearts of the people will be united, and the foundation of the war of resistance will be solid.

Only Sealing Up is Regrettable: The false "Mayor of Shanghai" Chuan Zongyao, whose registered residence is in Zhenhai, served a false position in his twilight years, without integrity and shame. There is nothing more to say. We, the people of the county, regret the lack of virtuous people in our hometown and hate the harm of inferior horses. Everyone points to him and wants to eat his flesh and sleep on his skin. However, the vicious situation is spreading, and it is not easy to divide the internal gaps. Under duress, the county government has presented it to the Military Affairs Committee to seal up and confiscate his residence and family property in Zhenhai. This kind of slightly relieving the people's anger and seeking the next best thing cannot stop our people's hope. Who knows that after more than three months, only sealing up has been added, and the order to confiscate has not yet been issued. The elimination of evil is not complete, and the enforcement of the law is not strict, which has caused deep regret in the opinion.

All Residences and Ancestral Temples Should Be Confiscated: During this period of national spiritual mobilization, the people's emotions in resisting and building the country are unusually surging. There should be no leniency in this punishment, and it should be thoroughly implemented, so as to extend the country's discipline and correct local education. We hereby present to the committee and ask to forward it to the Military Affairs Committee, to order the county government to confiscate all of Chuan Xiao's residences and ancestral temples in Zhenhai to replenish the war defense funds, so as to satisfy public sentiment and punish the traitor, which is convenient for the party.

### Ministry of Finance Restricts Remittances to Occupied Areas; Four Banks Stipulate Methods for Remitting Funds from Chongqing to Shanghai; Daily Quota Set; Remittances Continue When Quota is Met

In order to prevent the escape of funds, the Ministry of Finance has to strictly restrict the purchase of foreign exchange and arbitrarily carrying legal tender to occupied areas, and restrict remittances to occupied areas. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that Chongqing's remittance exchange, where the National Government is located, is centered on Shanghai. The rise and fall of remittances are usually based on the ratio of trade and the flow of silver. However, in the past, there were often speculators

Manipulating to profit from it, so the rise and fall of remittances were extremely large. In recent years, due to the unification of the currency system, the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China, have also established branches in Chongqing one after another to regulate finance, so the exchange rate has gradually stabilized. However, since the beginning of the war of resistance two years ago, due to domestic traffic obstructions and the expansion of occupied areas, the remittance situation has changed slightly. Since October last year, the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China, stipulated that for funds remitted to Shanghai and delivered in Shanghai, a handling fee of 10 cents per hundred yuan is charged, and a transportation fee of 90 cents. Each person should

Not Exceed Five Hundred Yuan. For those who deliver legal tender in Shanghai, a handling fee of 10 cents per hundred yuan and a transportation fee of 3 yuan and 90 cents are charged. Each person should not exceed one hundred yuan. A total quota is set for each day. When the quota is met, remittances must continue the next day. Even for colleagues, no excess accommodation is allowed. As a result, the state of remittance exchange from Chongqing to other provinces has reappeared. The funds remitted out must be completely offset by the amount of export trade. Since the four banks restricted remittances, merchants

Ordering Goods from Shanghai and Hong Kong has to increase handling fees and find ways to purchase the amount needed by themselves from various export firms. As a result, the black market for remittances gradually emerged. In October last year, the exchange rate of 10 yuan per thousand yuan for settlement funds suddenly rose to 70 or 80 yuan. In November, it rose to 110 yuan. In December, it rose to 140 yuan. In January of this year, the highest price reached 170 yuan. After that, the market price recovered slightly, but it always hovered between 140 and 150 yuan. The same phenomenon also appeared in Kunming and other places.

### Palace Museum Film Exhibition

Dr. Ding Hong loved photography all his life. His travels covered the country and abroad. Wherever he went, he put famous scenic spots and historical sites, as well as all natural scenery, into the lens. Therefore, he accumulated a large number of photos over the years. Dr. is now considering that the country has been in trouble for many years, the mountains and rivers have been broken, the roads are not peaceful, and travelers are discouraged. For a while, the photography world has been quite silent. He specially exhibited his Palace Museum photography when he roamed Beijing before the July 7th Incident, starting tomorrow on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company. All proceeds from the tickets will be used for medical relief. At this time when the mountains and rivers have changed color, Dr. presents the Palace Museum scenery to the public. The audience will definitely have feelings of the past and present. Following the exhibition of paintings and calligraphy of previous dynasties, there will definitely be another grand occasion.

### Jewish Refugee Buses Detained by Japanese Authorities - Accused of Transporting Chinese and Collecting Fares - No Response Regarding Japanese Businesses Operating

Continental News reports that yesterday (the 24th), it was learned that Japanese authorities are alleging that three buses owned by Jewish refugees, operating in Hongkou, are engaged in business as a public transportation company. The relief committee is conducting an investigation. The owners and drivers of the three vehicles have all denied the accusation. Japanese military police accuse the buses of carrying Chinese passengers and collecting fares, and have detained the vehicles since last week.

According to Japanese newspapers, a plainclothes Japanese military police officer, accompanied by a Chinese person, boarded one of these buses and was charged a fare. Consequently, all vehicles were detained pending investigation. At a press briefing last night, a Japanese military spokesperson, when questioned about military matters, stated that he only learned from the newspapers about the vehicle owners being accused of transporting Chinese passengers, but he would continue to investigate. A reporter stated that, according to his investigation, the vehicles are not public buses at all, but light freight vehicles licensed by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession.

The refugee committee has conducted a wide-ranging investigation. The nine relevant co-owners and drivers have all denied carrying anyone other than Jews. The company was formed solely to help refugees save on transportation costs to and from Shanghai, and all profits earned by the owners are reinvested in the vehicles. The spokesperson responded that if they are purely for private use, the Japanese side would not object to their operation.

Another reporter then asked about the status of the Japanese public buses currently operating in Hongkou. Are the Japanese authorities still insisting that these public buses are operating for military convenience, or will they now openly admit that they are public businesses run by commercial companies? The spokesperson replied that this matter is a complex issue and cannot be answered immediately. He then added that the matter is currently under discussion by "relevant parties," and therefore he could not make any further announcements.

### Amendment to Freight Transportation Examination Procedures - Ministry of Economic Affairs Facilitates Merchants and People - Responsibility Assigned to County and City Governments

The Ministry of Economic Affairs previously announced examination procedures for the transportation of prohibited goods to Shanghai, stipulating that all 54 types of goods would be examined by four agencies: the Trade Commission, the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Commission, the Resources Commission, and the Agricultural and Rural Bureau. Subsequently, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, citing the different examination agencies, noted the difficulty merchants faced when seeking approval. After requesting instructions from the Ministry, a detailed list was provided, specifying which agency should approve certain goods to avoid incorrect submissions. It is now reported that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, to facilitate merchants and the public, has amended Article 5 of the examination procedures, assigning responsibility for approval to the county and city governments at the point of origin, thereby streamlining the process. The amended procedures were announced on April 8th.

### Fire at Japanese Warehouse - Japanese Authorities Claim Arson - But Have Yet to Provide Evidence - Cargo Owners' Insurance Claims Unsuccessful

Continental News reports that yesterday (the 24th), it was learned that several foreigners' goods stored in the warehouse of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) in Hongkou were destroyed in a recent fire. Claims for compensation have been filed with a Japanese insurance company, but without satisfactory results. The insurance company's only response to the claims is that the matter has been handed over to the "Foreign Affairs Department" for review. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated at a press briefing last night that the cause of the fire is still under investigation. A suspicious device was found in the fire, but due to the intense heat, the suspicion could not be confirmed. An investigation is expected to proceed once a large quantity of cotton has been removed. The spokesperson further stated that there have been ten fires in Japanese warehouses recently, two of which were confirmed as arson. Arson is suspected as the cause of six out of ten fires at the NYK warehouse. Furthermore, on several occasions recently, Japanese ships setting sail from Shanghai have been found to have cargo loaded in Shanghai on fire.

A tea party was held at the Da Hsin Department Store on the fifth floor at 5:00 PM yesterday to thank the contributors. During the party, the initiators of the exhibition, Wu Hufan, Liu Haisu, and Ding Huikang, reported on the progress and achievements, which were very satisfactory. Finally, Secretary Liang from Da Hsin delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the department store, and Mr. Zhou Shoujuan also delivered a thank-you speech.

### Zhang Pinquan, Head of the Puppet "Government Affairs Office" in Zhabei, Missing

Zhang Pinquan, the head of the puppet "Government Affairs Office" in Zhabei, has been arrogant and domineering since taking office. The day before yesterday (the 23rd), Zhang went from the puppet office to the "puppet municipal government" in the city center to attend a meeting, but has not returned since and is suddenly missing. His family is quite surprised and sent someone to the "puppet municipal government" to inquire, but were told that he had not attended the meeting at the "government" and had not returned to the puppet "office." It is suspected that Zhang's whereabouts were discovered by Chinese plainclothes teams and he was intercepted on the way. Zhang's family is now requesting the Japanese authorities to investigate his whereabouts.

### Lawyer Zhang Ding Passes Away

Lawyer Zhang Ding, who practiced law in Shanghai for more than ten years, resolving difficulties and disputes with benevolence and chivalry, passed away in February of this year. His son, Jin Sheng, is holding a memorial service today at the Jingtu Temple on Guling Road. Mr. Zhang graduated from Soochow University and had a wide circle of friends. The event is expected to be a solemn and grand affair.

### Concubine and Children Accused of Embezzlement by Legal Wife - Case in the Second Special District Court is Under Appeal - Case in the First Special District Court Requires Prior Mediation

Chen Bo'an, a wealthy gentleman from Fengxian, brought his concubine, Ms. Li, and his two sons from the concubine, Junfu and Juntan, to Shanghai to seek refuge after the August 13th Incident. He subsequently fell ill and passed away in the inn. Afterwards, his wife, Ma Wenyun, and her sons, Junhai, Junhui, Junyan, Jun'e, and Junqu, arrived and completed the funeral arrangements. Upon inspecting the property deeds and documents stored in the chests, they discovered that they had all been embezzled by Ms. Li and her sons. As a result, his wife, concubine, brothers, and sons filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court of the French Concession, where they resided. After the initial trial, the losing party is currently appealing to the Third Branch Court of the Higher Court. Recently, Chen Ma's family discovered that Ms. Li and her sons, along with their relatives Yang Jinglu and Yang Yaozhang (also known as Yang Shuzhen), had embezzled estate property in the International Settlement. Therefore, they filed a private criminal suit against Chen Li's family in the First Special District Court, accusing them of embezzlement. A hearing was held once, but it was postponed until yesterday morning due to incomplete witness testimony. Judge Zhong Qing presided over the hearing. Only Chen Junfu appeared as a defendant. The others claimed illness or had left Shanghai and did not attend. The case file requested from the French Concession court could not be transferred because the appeal was still in progress. Judge Zhong, after considering the case, advised both parties to first request the civil court to resolve the disputed points. He then ruled in court to suspend the trial of this case.

### Foreign Exchange Control Effective - Reduction in Foreign Goods Imported to Shanghai - Gradual Recovery of Various Industries, Increased Financial Stability - Japanese Puppet Regime's Attempts to Plunder Capital Fail

Since the central government implemented wartime financial controls and restricted foreign exchange applications, imports of various non-essential commodities have decreased, and national funds have become more abundant. The Shanghai market's industry and commerce, with the vigorous assistance of the financial sector and the granting of loan facilities, have seen exceptional financial flexibility. The currency system in the war zones remains solid. The Japanese attempts to plunder civilian funds have failed. Details are provided below:

Monthly Decline in Foreign Goods Imported to Shanghai

Since the Ministry of Finance implemented foreign exchange controls and issued restrictions on applications, with the exception of essential industrial raw materials ordered from Europe and the United States, the central government has also made appropriate accommodations for essential commodities to protect industry and commerce. However, various industries in Shanghai, in order to conserve national resources for long-term resistance, have voluntarily reduced the amount of foreign exchange applied for. According to recent reports from the Central Bank of China and the customs authorities, the value of foreign goods imported to Shanghai has decreased month by month. The import of essential industrial raw materials through the southwestern customs points has significantly increased.

Vigorous Financial Recovery in Various Industries

Following the outbreak of the "August 13th" Songhu Battle, all industries were in a state of stagnation. Subsequently, factories in various industries relocated from the war zone to the concession area and resumed production, leading to improved conditions. At the same time, the financial sector provided vigorous assistance to various industries by granting loans. The banks and financial institutions themselves benefited from the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China's large-scale loans, resulting in increased capital and exceptionally stable finances. With the fourth quarter approaching, since the implementation of cash transactions among industries, the economic turnover is more active than before the war. No significant difficulties are expected during the settlement period.

Japanese Puppet Regime Fails to Plunder Capital

In the war zone along the Yangtze River, the Japanese are using their special influence to force the public to use Japanese currency and military scrip in order to plunder legal tender, in an attempt to buy foreign exchange and disrupt China's financial system. Recently, the "provisional government" of North China also transported large quantities of unprepared "Joint Notes" for mixed use in various regions. The puppet "Jiangsu Provincial Government" is also preparing to establish a "Provincial Bank" and issue banknotes. It is now learned that the people in the interior consider the Japanese puppet banknotes to have no value or credit. Even under the threat of violence, they are unwilling to use them. Since the middle of last month, transactions between Shanghai and the interior have been handled through alternative remittance methods. This prevents the Japanese puppet regime from absorbing funds and avoids accidental risks. Therefore, the Japanese plot is ultimately difficult to achieve.

### Celebrity Interview

Mr. Yu Qiaqing

— Zhou

The Spirit of Serving Society - Lifetime Devotion to Loyalty, Trustworthiness, Diligence, and Frugality - Decades of Struggle, Admired by Chinese and Foreigners - New Compilation of Old News - Shanghai's Anecdotes

Mr. Yu Qiaqing, at the advanced age of 73, continues to serve society with unwavering dedication. His achievements and virtues have long been admired by Chinese and foreigners alike. Yesterday, the reporter visited him and engaged in a lengthy conversation with Mr. Yu in his simply furnished reception room. He was enthusiastic, tireless, and his sincere attitude was truly admirable.

From the conversation, it was learned that Mr. Yu has voluntarily resigned from many public positions in recent years and now only serves as a Chinese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, chairman of the Refugee Relief Association, and chairman of the Ningbo Fellow Association. Mr. Yu has been re-elected to the position of Chinese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council in successive elections, without any changes. This is not only due to his long-standing historical connections and his being respected by Chinese and foreign circles, but also because Mr. Yu himself feels that his aspirations for the municipal administration of the concession have not yet been fully realized, and he continues to serve. Mr. Yu has always prioritized responsibility in any public or private position. Regardless of the weather, he goes to his office every day. He personally participates in banquets and condolences. He is still in his office at around 7:00 or 8:00 PM every evening. He personally reviews all public and private letters and telegrams, even on holidays. His spirit of service is truly worthy of emulation by future generations. His personal life is extremely frugal. His long gowns and black jackets are all domestically produced. He has no special hobbies and is very much suited to the common people. He pays close attention to the content of various newspapers and expressed his deep admiration for this newspaper, praising it as a good read for the industrial and commercial community.

After meeting Mr. Yu, the reporter first asked him to share his opinions on the Qingnian service industry and commerce, based on his personal experience of serving society. Mr. Yu said that, in terms of his personal experience of dealing with the world, he adheres to the four principles of loyalty, trustworthiness, diligence, and frugality as the main purpose. Loyalty and trustworthiness are used to deal with the world, while diligence and frugality are used to cultivate oneself. Looking around the world, all those who have achieved great success have followed this path. Even in his own case, his early circumstances were extremely difficult. Now, he humbly accepts the appreciation of society and has always adhered to these four principles. In recent times, the world is becoming increasingly decadent, with a growing preference for novelty. The environment in Shanghai is complex, and young people can easily go astray if they are not careful, eventually leading to personal ruin and a damaged reputation. Mr. Yu also said that he had long wanted to share this point with the industrial and commercial community in Shanghai. Having been asked, he only offers a humble opinion and hopes that young people can practice it diligently.

The reporter then asked about the current state of relief work. Mr. Yu said that he has always been enthusiastic about relief work in the city. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, war refugees have flocked to the city, numbering as many as one million. Fortunately, Chinese and foreign relief organizations have worked tirelessly and wholeheartedly to implement relief efforts, benefiting the refugees greatly. After more than a year of operation, the dedication and perseverance of Chinese and foreign people are truly admirable. In accordance with the principles of human mutual assistance, all residents of Shanghai have an unshirkable duty. After consultation between Chinese and foreign parties, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association was established in November of last year, and he was elected as the chairman. At that time, there were still more than 100,000 refugees, all of whom were poor and had nowhere to go. In order to harness the power of the people, reduce the worries of the Relief Committee about Shanghai refugees, and save relief funds for refugees in the interior, the establishment of the Association was urgent. Prior to this, he consulted with foreign business leaders, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Financial Industry Association, local associations, and charitable organizations with whom he had friendly relations. They all expressed their enthusiastic support for refugee relief, and the Association was established and began to implement relief work. So far, it has established two shelters in Yanping Road and Dunxin Road, merging some shelters in the central area of the two concessions, which has greatly facilitated management. In addition, city housing is allowed to be borrowed for a long time. However, refugee relief should focus on both education and care, in order to turn them into self-sufficient producers in the future. Therefore, an education committee and an education department were added to the Association, and famous figures from the academic community were invited to plan and implement the work together. According to his age, he should have retired, but for the sake of refugee relief, he cannot shirk his responsibility and has to work hard to shoulder the burden, in order to express his sincere intention to contribute.

The reporter continued to inquire about the situation in Shanghai. Mr. Yu was enthusiastic and inspiring. The reporter then asked about his early years of service to society. The reporter said that he would use Mr. Yu's virtue to encourage future generations. Mr. Yu smiled and said that it would be acceptable to talk about his experience as a minor anecdote in Shanghai, just like the new "New Compilation of Old News" section of your newspaper. Mr. Yu said that he came to Shanghai in the eighth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (i.e., 1881 AD) and has been here for 58 years. In these 58 years, what he has seen and experienced is vast and complex. Here are some of the more prominent things he remembers: (1)

### Previous Night's Tragic Car Accident in Hongkou: Police Department Investigates the Case – Sentry's Harsh Order to Stop Led to a Major Calamity – Japanese Soldiers Patrol Hospital and Assault Chief Inspector – Bureau Awaits Report Before Lodging Protest – Dr. Li Li Devoted His Life to Education, Sudden Passing Mourned by Chinese and Foreigners

*The Continental Daily* reports that Dr. Li Li, principal of the Lester School of Industry, was driving his car in Hongkou just after 9:00 PM last night (the 24th). Mrs. Li Li and Western Inspector Wimsett of the Public Concession Police were also in the car. They encountered a Japanese sentry who ordered them to stop. Li Li stopped too quickly, and because the road was slippery, he crashed into a Japanese public bus, resulting in his death. This was only six hours after Li Li's return to Shanghai from England (Editor's note: This matter was briefly mentioned in the last news item in yesterday's newspaper in the Local News and Telegraph section). Mrs. Li Li and the Western inspector were also seriously injured. The former had lacerations on her face and forehead, while the latter, Mr. Wimsett, suffered a fractured left leg and ribs. While the details of this tragedy were not fully known last night,

Sentry's Order to Stop Causes Accident

It is known that the collision occurred around 9:05 PM. Dr. Li Li and the other two were returning after inspecting the buildings of the Lester School, heading along Minhang Road. It is reported that as the car was about to turn onto Broadway Road to cross the Garden Bridge, they encountered a Japanese sentry who ordered them to stop. When the car did not stop immediately, the sentry jumped onto the running board and loudly ordered Li Li to stop. Li Li immediately slammed on the brakes, but because it had rained in the evening and the road surface was slippery, Li Li's car skidded violently across the corner of Minhang Road and Broadway Road, colliding with a Japanese public bus traveling north from the Garden Bridge. The impact was so severe that the car was completely destroyed, and the front of the public bus was also heavily damaged. A call was immediately made to the Fire Department, and an ambulance was summoned. However, by the time the ambulance arrived, Li Li had already died. His body, along with Mrs. Li Li and Western Inspector Wimsett, were taken to the Country Hospital.

A Team of Japanese Soldiers Suddenly Arrives at the Hospital

They remained in the hospital last night. The injured Western inspector's condition is quite serious. As for the sentry who attempted to stop the car, he was thrown from the running board during the collision and was taken away by the Japanese Naval authorities. No news of his injuries has been received, but it is said his condition is also serious. The Japanese driver of the public bus also sustained minor injuries. A Chinese female ticket seller in the bus had a cut above her right eye and suffered a concussion. Last night, responsible parties claimed that shortly after the incident, a team of Japanese Marines arrived at the Country Hospital, requesting to see the injured. Hospital authorities initially refused them access to Mrs. Li Li and Western Inspector Wimsett but eventually allowed them to view Li Li's body. It is reported that the Marines then used force and intimidation, insisting on seeing Mrs. Li Li's face. At that time, a Japanese officer arrived on the scene and ordered the soldiers to return, while he was granted permission to see Mrs. Li Li.

Founder of Lester School Recently Returned to Shanghai

Dr. Li Li was born in 1901 in Durham, England, and studied at Sunderland Technical College. He came to Shanghai in 1933 and established the Lester School of Industry at 505 East Seward Road. He returned to his home country for official business ten weeks ago, and only yesterday afternoon did he return to Shanghai aboard the German ship *Gneisenau*. Western Inspector Wimsett is also British, and his wife and children are in Shanghai. He was scheduled to leave Shanghai next month for his first long-term vacation. Why he was also riding in Li Li's car was not confirmed last night. It is speculated that he was returning to the Public Concession south of the Suzhou Creek and therefore asked to ride with Li Li. According to the Domei News Agency, Dr. Li Li "failed to avoid" the sentry, leading to the collision. The injured sentry was a first-class seaman, and the driver of the Japanese public bus was Chinese, not Japanese. It is also said that Li Li's car sped past the Japanese naval sentry post on the Garden Bridge, and the Japanese naval authorities immediately began an investigation but refused to issue a formal statement last night.

Car Smashed in Unprecedented Tragedy

After the incident, traffic on Broadway Road was blocked for some time. Trams entering the factory at night could not cross the Garden Bridge and stopped along the Bund, from the bridge to Nanjing Road. Also, *The North-China Daily News* reported that just after 9:00 PM last night, Dr. Li Li, accompanied by his wife and Western Inspector Wimsett, was in a green Ford sedan that collided violently with a Japanese public bus near Broadway Road and Pengpu Road. Li Li's car was struck in the center of the right side by the public bus. Both doors were destroyed, and the roof was torn off. There was blood in the rear compartment of the car. The severity of the collision could be seen from the state of the seats and the floor. Western Inspector Wimsett was sitting in the back seat and bled profusely before being removed from the car. Reporters arrived on the scene a few minutes later, but several Japanese sentries, with bayonets fixed on their rifles, surrounded the two cars and prevented them from approaching. The windshield of the public bus was completely destroyed, and the radiator and right fender were also heavily damaged.

Japanese Soldiers Threaten and Assault Chief Inspector

The reporter witnessed astonishing scenes at the Country Hospital. Several Public Concession Police officers in plainclothes and uniforms, along with a Japanese officer, believed to be an officer of the Japanese Marines, accompanied by two guards with rifles, strode into the reception room. Speaking in Japanese, they firmly demanded that others show them the injured parties' rooms and lead them to the responsible doctors. They also questioned Chief Inspector Samson of the Police, speaking in Japanese. Samson, who did not understand Japanese, could not comprehend their meaning. Unexpectedly, the Japanese officer punched Samson below his right ear and ordered him to leave. Samson maintained his composure and retreated several steps. Seeing the Japanese officer approaching him again in a threatening manner, he said that he would return with the Japanese chief inspector from the Hongkou Police Station. He then left the hospital and went to the Hongkou Police Station, but the Japanese chief inspector, despite being summoned by telephone, had not arrived by 10:15 PM.

Attempt to See Injured Parties Ultimately Rejected

The Japanese officer then, along with several others who arrived at the same time, attempted to forcibly enter the sickrooms again, but were prevented by doctors MacGollrick and Anderson, who were treating the injured. Seeing that their efforts had failed, the Japanese officer attempted to prevent anyone from leaving the hospital and tried to gather everyone in the reception room into one room for questioning. After Samson was struck, a minor incident occurred. The shoes and police cap worn by Western Inspector Wimsett were taken out by a deputy police inspector in plainclothes. Upon seeing this, the Japanese officer suddenly asked the deputy police inspector in English where he had gotten the shoes and cap and why he was taking them. The deputy police inspector replied that the doctor had given them to him. The Japanese officer then remained silent. An hour after the incident, about twenty-five Japanese officers and soldiers were on the scene measuring the width of the road and recording it. A detective from the Hongkou Police Station was also on the scene recording. A Japanese photographer was taking flash photographs.

Son Suffering from Cough, Mother Requested to Return Home

Late last night, it was reported that Mrs. Li Li was in stable condition and would be able to return to her residence on Weihaiwei Road this morning (the 25th). Although Western Inspector Wimsett had lost a lot of blood, he had to remain in the hospital, but his injuries were also satisfactory. Dr. Li Li was highly regarded in the local education and social circles, and his sudden death is mourned by all sectors. The doctor has a son who is only three years old. According to *The Shanghai Times*, Mrs. Li Li asked the doctor to send her home after undergoing surgery because her son was suffering from a cough and needed his mother's care. The doctor naturally refused.

Collecting Evidence in Preparation for Protest

According to the English *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury*, Mrs. Li Li and Western Inspector Wimsett, who were injured in the car accident in Hongkou, are still unable to speak freely, so the Municipal Council Police have not been able to obtain the details of the accident. This morning (the 25th), Mrs. Li Li's condition improved slightly, but Mr. Wimsett's condition is still quite serious. The Japanese public bus that collided with Li Li's car was operating without a Municipal Council license, infringing on the rights of the China General Omnibus Company. The bus only had a small green light on the front, making it difficult to see at night. Chief Inspector Samson was punched in the head by a Japanese officer at the Country Hospital. This morning, according to a senior official of the Municipal Council, the Japanese side has not yet apologized to the Police. It was also stated that the Police are currently busy collecting the details of the case, and because Mrs. Li Li and the Western inspector were both seriously injured, it will take some time. Once a detailed report has been prepared, it will be submitted to the Municipal Council for review.

Home Burglarized, Awaiting Interrogation

A reporter from the *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* inquired at the office of the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council as to whether a protest had been lodged with the Japanese authorities regarding this case. The reply was that the Municipal Council was awaiting a detailed report. Dr. Li Li's residence at 401 Great Western Road was recently burglarized, with significant losses, including a radio worth 400 yuan. Mrs. Li Li was unable to determine the total value of the remaining items. The Police were waiting for Li Li's return to inquire about everything, but unfortunately, this could not be fulfilled. His residence faces the Municipal Council Road and backs onto "badlands" not managed by the Police. Li Li's body was examined at the International Funeral Parlor at 2:30 PM this afternoon by the coroner of the British Consulate General, confirming that he died from his injuries.

### Local Tyrants Bully and Seize Rice Industry Docks – Obstruct Rice Boats and Arbitrarily Exploit Laborers – Labor Union Appoints Lawyer to Investigate According to Law

Recently, rice transported to Shanghai from the mainland has mostly been unloaded at the Tianhou Temple Changtai Transportation Dock on the Suzhou Creek, designated by the Municipal Council. Laborers have always been contracted to handle the unloading and transportation. These laborers, numbering no less than a thousand, are organized into the Shanghai Rice Cart Shoulder Transportation Industry Labor Union and have generally been peaceful. However, recently, local tyrants Zhang Liguo and Zhang Jiujin, etc., coveting profits, gathered their henchmen and, specifically at Changtai Transportation and undesignated docks, have been obstructing rice boats from proceeding to the docks designated by the Municipal Council, arbitrarily extorting money, and exploiting the livelihoods of cart laborers, causing hundreds of laborers who rely on this for a living to be unemployed. When challenged, they resort to violence. It is reported that Zhang and others dare to act so recklessly, with one Tao acting as the mastermind behind the scenes. Previously, representatives from various rice industry associations, on behalf of the laborers, petitioned the authorities to find a way to prohibit this, but no effect was seen. The laborers believe that this kind of arrogant and predatory behavior is not only related to public safety and hinders the commercial market, but is also prohibited by law. Therefore, the Labor Union has hired lawyer Zhang Enhai as its permanent legal advisor, posting public notices and filing a lawsuit with the court to investigate the matter according to law.

### Fake "Detective" Zeng Yuren Arrested for Extortion – Attempted Extortion at the Santai Hotel – Owner Reported to Police, Arrested and Interrogated

Zeng Yuren, a native of Hunan, previously served in the Songhu Garrison Command. After the war, he defected and joined the Special High Branch of the Jin-gugu Gendarmerie Command of the Japanese military, where he served as a detective. From then on, relying on his potential power, he engaged in various fraudulent activities. At 10:00 PM on the 23rd of this month, Zeng suddenly went to the Santai Hotel at 484 Jiujiang Road, accompanied by Xu Yongfa, a native of Nanjing, claiming that the hotel was selling counterfeit Japanese passes.

Therefore, He came to search. The hotel claimed that this was not the case, and that they had only hired a car for a guest to go to Hongkou. After searching the accounts table, no passes or other items were found. Zeng continued to make a scene, insisting that the Santai Hotel was indeed forging passes, and intended to take the staff member Wu Xinhe to the Japanese Gendarmerie Command. Xu acted as a mediator. As a result, Zeng took

Ten yuan in legal tender from the accounts table. Before leaving, he stated that he would have to come back tomorrow, revealing that the hotel would have to give him a considerable sum of money to settle the matter. On the 24th, Zeng and Xu indeed came again, behaving even more fiercely than the day before. At the time, he made a phone call to the Yangtze Hotel, claiming to be notifying the office of the Japanese Gendarmerie Command to

Send someone to Arrest the Criminal. The owner of the Santai Hotel, Ren Zixian, managed to report to the Old Zha Police Station. Chinese Detective Sun Dafa rushed to the scene and arrested Zeng and Xu. A detective certificate from the Special High Branch of the Jin-gugu Gendarmerie Command was found on Zeng. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi charged them with

Extortion and Fraud under Article 346 of the Criminal Law, and requested that the hearing be postponed to allow for investigation of the defendants' identities, etc. Subsequently, Ren Zixian, Wu Xinhe, and others filed petitions detailing the extortion they had suffered. After interrogating the two defendants, Judge Xiao Xiezhen ordered them to be detained and the hearing postponed.

### On the Vegetable Market – Young Girl Seduced and Deflowered – Private Meetings with Butcher – Nine Consecutive Nights, Both Willing to Pledge Allegiance – Negotiations Break Down, Butcher Arrested

Mr. Wang, a native of Pudong who is a senior staff member of a real estate department of a foreign firm, is over forty years old and resides at No. 2 Jingxing Village, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. Wang's wife, Mrs. Liu, is forty-one years old this year and has a daughter named Peizhen, who is seventeen years old this year. She has a beautiful face, has received higher primary education, and is awaiting marriage. A local man named Wang Heshang, who is twenty-nine years old this year, lives at No. 223 North Qianjiatang, East Baoshan Road. Every morning at the vegetable market near the Sacred Heart of Mary Church on Avenue du Lutet,

A Fresh Meat Stall Is Set Up For business and has not yet married. On the morning of the 6th of this month, Mr. Wang's daughter, Wang Peizhen, took a basket to the vegetable market on Avenue du Lutet to buy vegetables. Passing in front of Wang Heshang's meat stall, Wang suddenly saw Peizhen and was struck by her beauty. He immediately struck up a conversation with the girl, and then induced her to stay at his house. He treated her kindly with lunch and dinner. In the evening, Wang Heshang pretended to send the girl home, and brought her to the Xixing Hotel on Avenue du Lutet and booked Room No. 1. That night, he

Forcibly Violated the Girl. Afterwards, he still did not let her go. The two lived in the hotel for nine consecutive days. Initially, the girl's parents, due to their daughter's disappearance, sent people out to search for her without any trace. Just as they were in alarm and suspicion, they suddenly received a letter from their daughter Peizhen, summoning her mother, Mrs. Liu, to the Xixing Hotel for a talk. Mrs. Liu responded to the summons and met with her daughter. Peizhen told her mother that she had already had relations with Wang Heshang, and Wang Heshang was willing to marry her, and she was willing to marry him. The Wangs listened to their daughter's words and did not object. They told the girl to inform Wang Heshang that he must send a tea gift of 300 yuan. Unfortunately, Wang Heshang's purse was empty and he could not afford it. He asked Dai Buxiang, the owner of the Greater China Hotel at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Yu Qiaqing Road, to mediate with the girl's parents. As of now, it has been more than half a month, and because Wang Heshang has no money, the situation cannot be resolved. The girl's parents believe that Wang Heshang intends to ruin their daughter's reputation, which is especially hateful. Therefore, the girl's mother, Mrs. Wang Liu, reported to the French Police, who dispatched detectives the other day to

Arrest Wang Heshang. He was sent to the Second Special Court. Yesterday, Judge Liao Yuan conducted a preliminary hearing in the First Criminal Court. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi, representing the French Concession Administration, stated the facts of the case and requested an adjournment for further investigation before filing a lawsuit. After reviewing the case in court, the judge issued an order for the defendant to be detained and a further hearing scheduled for May 3. The defendant was taken into custody. An order was also issued for the victim to undergo a medical examination at the Medical Examiner's Office pending verification.

### The Fate of a Beauty is Thin – Once Studied Dancing, Recently Striving to Improve Herself – Economic Hardship Forces Mother to Force Her to Return to Old Profession – Daughter Indignant, Commits Suicide by Swallowing Raw Opium

Liu Zhen, a Ningbo woman, is twenty years old and resides at No. 1 Dong Zhuanbang, Yidingpan Road, West Shanghai. She once worked as a dance hostess, but is now a female worker in a factory, earning more than twenty yuan a month. She attends evening classes and is diligent in her studies. She also has three family members, including her sister-in-law. Her mother is addicted to gambling, and her brother suffers from epilepsy, confined to bed all year round, and does not work. All the household expenses rely on Liu alone. Therefore, she is often in financial straits and lacks funds. Yesterday evening around 8:30 PM, her mother again tried to force Liu to return to her old profession and become a dance hostess again to ease the household burden. The girl refused, as she was born into a prominent family and had an inheritance of over 100,000 yuan, which was all squandered by her mother on smoking and gambling, leaving the family destitute. Although she now works to make a living, she is keeping herself clean and can still find solace. She is determined not to engage in the life of hugging and embracing again. She begged her mother, but her mother's inferior nature was too deep-rooted and she became angry out of shame, beating her several times. After being comforted by those living with her, Liu had thoughts of death and secretly took raw opium to commit suicide. She was taken to the hospital by ambulance for treatment. It is said that she took too much poison, and her life is in danger.

### Prostitutes Quarrel over Romance – Xiao Xianggu Gathers Crowd to Assault – Lin Linlin Injured on the Head

Lin Linlin, a prostitute from Jiangsu, age twenty-five, runs a brothel at No. *something* Qunyu Lane, Shantou Road. Xiao Xianggu, who is close friends with Lin, also plies the trade of a courtesan. Because Lin's brothel had spare rooms, Xiao Xianggu moved in after the Lunar New Year, sharing the profession and making a living. One of Lin's clients, however, often interacted with Xiao Xianggu and was seduced by her, paying attention to her day and night and effectively switching sides. Lin Linlin, upon discovering this, could not help but be consumed by jealousy, becoming heartbroken. She lamented the client's heartlessness and hated Xiao Xianggu's disloyalty, so she made sarcastic remarks and ridiculed her from time to time. However, Xiao Xianggu was not weak either and often mocked Lin. Lin Linlin, feeling angry and unjust, issued an eviction order, telling Xiao Xianggu to move out. So, at 11:30 PM last night, a major quarrel broke out over this matter. Xiao Xianggu was at a loss for words but was unwilling to submit. She summoned five thugs from outside and went to the brothel to use force, actually piercing Lin's head with a hole, causing blood to flow profusely. The furnishings in the room were also smashed to pieces. Fortunately, the room attendants mediated and pleaded for peace, which stopped the violence. Lin was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Since the matter involved bloodshed, the hospital reported it to the Old Zha Police Station, which dispatched Detective No. 98 to investigate and report back to the police station. The police are now tracking down Xiao Xianggu and the thugs to bring them to justice.

Science and Life

### Youth of Science and Wealth

— Ji Qian

I have previously stated that impoverished youth should strive in science and that they have the potential for invention and achievement. Now, I would like to humbly offer my opinions to the wealthy youth, as encouragement. Wealthy youth inherit the legacy of their fathers and elder brothers, their lives are free from material concerns, and they face no difficulties in studying. Impoverished individuals can dedicate themselves to scientific research and still become experts, benefiting the nation and society, and achieving immortal fame. If young people with abundant resources and convenient opportunities are willing to strive for progress, their accomplishments in science will be limitless. The Englishman Galton is an example of a wealthy young man who became a great figure in the history of science. Galton, in his youth, due to his family's wealth, did not need to rush into making a living, and he enjoyed studying science on his own. Initially, he studied geography, traveling extensively in continental Europe and South Africa. Later, he studied meteorology, biology, mathematics, and finally specialized in genetics, where he laid the foundation for eugenics (the commonly translated "優生學" - literally 'superior birth studies') and made significant contributions to anthropometry, eventually becoming as famous as Darwin, Huxley, and Spencer. In Europe and America, numerous wealthy young people have achieved great success and fame in science in a similar manner, making good use of their opportunities to benefit themselves and the world. Wealthy young people in our country should take them as role models. After the Russian Revolution, the assets of the former nobles and wealthy families were completely lost. Among them, those who were proficient in various sciences are now distributed in various countries, serving as university professors or specialized technicians, with stable lives and growing reputations. Those who were accustomed to luxury and ease, lazy and incompetent, could not even survive, wandering in foreign lands and becoming beggars. This is something our people have witnessed, and wealthy young people should take it as a warning. In the past, our country encountered unprecedented disasters. The soldiers on the front lines who resisted the enemy did not hesitate to sacrifice themselves and shed their blood for the freedom of the nation. Government leaders launched a nationwide spiritual mobilization. Many wealthy young people were enthusiastic patriots, rising up to fight together, using rare opportunities to dedicate themselves to scientific pursuits, either studying at school or learning on their own at home, using their wealth, time, and energy for scientific work, which will surely benefit the future of the nation. I hope that those with aspirations will not dismiss my words as irrelevant.

### The Story of Steelmaking

— Xin

Iron can be said to be everywhere, generally existing in the form of compounds with oxygen, that is, iron oxide. If iron oxide is heated together with carbon, iron can be obtained. What is obtained in this way is cast iron or wrought iron, with most of the impurities from the ore contained inside. After being heated and hammered, most of it can be removed. Ordinary blacksmiths do this kind of work, shaping it into various forms. However, it is too soft and not suitable for practical use, nor can it be used for cast iron (sand casting). This is because it only melts at 2700 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the melting point of pure iron. However, people are very clever and have found ways to harden it. First, the wrought iron is hammered into the desired shape, then buried in charcoal and heated, then taken out and immersed in water or oil. Skilled craftsmen can forge it as hard as modern-day blades. People at the time naturally knew how to do it, but not why. We now know that carbon slowly penetrates the iron, like gas penetrating wood. When iron contains carbon, it will harden when suddenly cooled while hot. Because the carbon is drilled in from the outside, skilled blacksmiths can forge weapons with sharp blades and tough bodies. They can indeed make good steel, but the output will not be large and the price will be high.

At the same time, the method of melting iron was also developed, which involves using deep charcoal furnaces with air blown in, burying the iron deep inside so that it melts. However, the result is not very much like iron because it becomes very brittle, like glass. But it can be used for sand casting. The iron used two hundred years ago was all this kind of cast iron. We know that iron made in this way contains as much as 3.5% carbon, and the melting point is reduced by 3500 degrees, but it is still higher than the melting point of brass. This method was still used to make iron in the early twentieth century. The furnaces used could only produce six tons of iron per day.

At that time, steel was made from wrought iron, but the output was very small. In 1856, the German Bessemer came up with the idea of forcing air into hard iron, causing it to burn spontaneously. In twenty minutes, fifteen tons of steel could be made. This turned brittle iron into flexible steel, which was also stronger than wrought iron. As a result, the price was greatly reduced, and it became possible to build railways on a large scale.

In addition, there is the open-hearth furnace method. This method is not as good as the Bessemer method, partly because it uses more fuel and partly because the output is not very large. However, because it can use any kind of iron as raw material, the quality of the steel produced is relatively good. Therefore, thirty years ago, the amount of steel produced using open-hearth furnaces exceeded the amount produced using the Bessemer method. Ten years ago, it exceeded it by as much as seven times.

Whether making steel or iron, the need for air to aid combustion is the same. In reality, it is the oxygen that is needed. But air is only 23% oxygen. Therefore, if oxygen can be used directly, the smelting method can also be improved. However, the price of oxygen is too high, which is not cost-effective. Recently, the method of manufacturing oxygen has improved, and the gradual use of oxygen has indeed achieved great results. Costs can be reduced, output can be increased, quality can be uniform, procedures can be simplified, and raw materials and fuels of inferior quality can be used. Impurities such as sulfur and phosphorus can also be reduced. Sulfur and phosphorus are harmful components in steel and iron, and are absolutely undesirable. Oxygen can be used to burn them away cleanly.

### The Greenhouse-Style Reconnaissance Aircraft

— Zhen

The latest greenhouse-style reconnaissance aircraft has been tested during US Army maneuvers, with excellent results. This reconnaissance aircraft actually resembles a flying greenhouse. Its long cockpit roof is entirely covered with transparent glass panels, providing the greatest possible field of vision. The fuselage is a mid-wing design, equipped with an 850-horsepower engine and retractable landing gear. This is the most suitable aircraft for high-altitude reconnaissance.

### Longevity

— Passerby under the Bridge

The ancients said that eight thousand years is a spring, and eight thousand years is an autumn. Is this really true?

Let's not talk about textual research for now, and just ask, what is the length of human life? As far as individuals are concerned, living to a hundred years is a long life. Everyone knows that there are indeed centenarians. However, "it is rare to live to seventy years since ancient times." Most people do not live to seventy. What exactly is human life, and what method should be used to report it? People with common sense will say that the average can be used as a report. This is correct; this report is called average lifespan. Suppose there are two people, one who dies at one year old and another who dies at fifty-nine years old. The total age of the two people is sixty, so the average age is thirty. Everyone can see clearly here that wherever infants die in greater numbers, the average lifespan of the people there will inevitably be shorter. The relationship between average lifespan and infant mortality is too deep. In other words, adults are actually implicated by young children, so it is not very appropriate to use it to report on the length of human life. Currently, the comparison of human lifespan in various countries is reported using "median lifespan." Suppose a hundred children are born in a certain place on a certain day of a certain month of a certain year. These hundred people of the same age will naturally grow up together, and some will naturally return to their hometown midway. Deaths in childhood are not counted. If the number of deaths at the age of sixty-six is the highest, then sixty-six years old is taken as the median lifespan, or the normal lifespan. The normal lifespan in advanced countries has reached over seventy years. This is a report based on the majority. As for living to a hundred years, it may as well be regarded as an auspicious sign and put aside.

The great enemies of normal lifespan are nothing more than the disasters of war, plague, and natural disasters such as floods and droughts. If wars are excluded, then people in countries with well-developed sanitation administration will live out their full years relatively more often; there are no other miraculous life-extending tonics or resurrection herbs. As for the elixir of immortality and the art of returning to youth, Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of Han sought them in vain, and with the rapid development of science, there is still no way to obtain them in this world. From a logical point of view, immortality and returning to youth are impossible. Once they are possible, it would be a step backward, a regression. Why is that? Originally, we were already returning to youth before we aged; we were already being reborn before we died – still referring to our having children or even grandchildren! We have already handed over the major responsibility of immortality and returning to youth to a part of our organs – the reproductive organs – for full management, which is still a division of labor, a phenomenon of progress. If we live to seventy years old and take some kind of golden elixir, and then suddenly transform into an infant, competing with our grandchildren for milk, wouldn't that be superfluous? If after taking the elixir, one me turns into two me's, two me's turn into four me's, and continue to transform in this way, then it would be equivalent to fission, degenerating to the extreme. Or, one might say, we should stay at the age of twenty or thirty. Hey! The legal age for the President of the Republic of China is forty years old. This is clearly an illegal statement. In addition, the characteristic of life is uninterrupted material exchange; stagnation is impossible. Jin Shengtan, in his preface to *Romance of the Western Chamber*, says it very powerfully in the chapter on lamenting the ancients: that's right, the me of today is no longer the me drawn yesterday; some cells die and some cells are born, this is uninterrupted material exchange. Before the moment of death arrives, he is already grieving; this is where Shengtan's intelligence surpasses others.

Under the same sanitary environment, there are still inconsistencies in human lifespan, which is related to heredity. It turns out that lifespan has a lineage; after having a lifespan lineage, even if the body is weak, one often enjoys old age. The lifespan of various animals has a considerable range. For example, turtles live for about two hundred years and dogs live for about thirty years. This is the nature of the created lineage. All turtles generally have that lifespan, and all dogs generally do not exceed that lifespan. Sanitation cannot equalize the lifespans of the two.

### Mechanical Heart-Lung

— Rong Ren

The iron lung has long been successfully tested and can cure diseases. Now there is another machine that can replace the functions of the heart and lungs. In the future, if the heart and lungs are accidentally damaged, life may have a way to be prolonged. This machine is being tested in a US laboratory and has already been proven to prolong the lives of animals.

The function of the mechanical heart-lung is roughly as follows. A tube is inserted into a vein, and an electric pump draws the blood out, then a transmission vessel shoots it to the mechanical lung. The transmission vessel is encased in a glass tube; hot water flows continuously between the inner and outer tube walls, maintaining the temperature of the blood. The mechanical lung is a chrome-plated copper cylinder that rotates rapidly, several hundred times per minute. Because of this rapid rotation, the blood is sprayed onto the inner wall of the cylinder, forming a conductive film, which easily absorbs the oxygen passing through the cylinder cavity. After the blood is cleansed by oxygen, it is sent back into the animal's body by the pump. This is the same procedure as the blood in a healthy human body, from the heart, through the veins, to the lungs, where it is cleansed by the oxygen in the lungs, and then returns to the heart through the veins. In the attached diagram, the cylinder on the left is the artificial lung. The slanting glass tube in the center stores warm water to keep the blood at the proper temperature.

### More Sunlight at the Earth's Poles

— Xi Wu

We usually think that the Earth's poles receive less sunlight than the equator. But strangely enough, the opposite is actually true. Because sunlight is refracted by the atmosphere when it hits the Earth, the sun can still be seen at the poles even when it has set below the horizon. According to scientists' calculations, this refraction effect can increase the amount of sunlight by 105 hours per year at the Earth's poles, but only increases it by 40 hours at the equator. In other words, the poles receive 65 more hours of sunlight per year than the equator.

### Five Tons of Silver Consumed Weekly

— Xi Wu

The American Kodak film company consumes five tons of silver per week to produce photographic emulsion. Except for the country's mint, this company consumes the most silver. But in 1885, this company only consumed forty pounds of silver per week.

Currently, 80% of the world's silver production comes from Mexico, Canada, Peru, and the United States. But apart from the silver produced in Mexico, most of the new silver does not come from silver mines, but rather as a byproduct of lead, copper, and zinc mines.

Automatic Parachute

Recently, someone has manufactured an automatic parachute that even novices can use, because it can open automatically, without the parachutist nervously pulling the release cord. Its cover has a bag that can "catch" the airflow and open the parachute. But if the rider wishes, they can also pull the cord as usual to open the parachute. This parachute is twenty-four feet in diameter, two feet shorter than ordinary parachutes. The rider only needs to pull a guide rope to make the parachute descend in the specified direction, so it is easier to control than ordinary parachutes.

Torpedo That Can Turn Back

Elliso S. Purington of Massachusetts, USA, has recently invented a torpedo that can turn back if it misses and attack the target again. This invention has been registered with the Patent Office.

The secret of this new underwater weapon is a line (metal wire) that is towed behind the torpedo. When the torpedo attacks an enemy ship and misses, passing in front of the ship, and this towed line comes into contact with the ship, it completes an electrical circuit, and the torpedo immediately turns around and attacks a second time. The direction it turns depends on the direction of the enemy ship. This second attack is unlikely to miss, because the torpedo is closer to the target this time.

### Will it End Without Resolution?

— Mao Lie

Watching the European situation for the past few days, some people feel that it seems to be tending towards a resolution without resolution.

Roosevelt asked Germany and Italy if they could refrain from invading other countries for ten or twenty-five years. Mussolini gave a vague speech as a reply. Although Hitler has not replied yet, looking at the preparations he has been hurriedly engaged in these days, they are nothing more than an attempt to prevaricate with Roosevelt. A direct and clear answer is also certain to be absent. This is one.

Chamberlain saw that Albania had been annexed and that other small countries were about to suffer the same fate, directly threatening the British Empire itself. Therefore, he hurriedly promoted anti-aggression alliances and strengthened collective security organizations. The initial situation seemed to be progressing smoothly, and everything could be resolved satisfactorily. Unexpectedly, Poland is now wavering, and Britain itself still has not changed its attitude of suspicion and hesitation towards the Soviet Union. No one can say what the future holds. This is two.

The British ambassador to Germany, Henderson, returned to his country before because Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, as a demonstration. Now he has been allowed to return to Berlin. Within two or three days, the French ambassador to Germany, Coulondre, will also follow suit. They have already embellished the reasons for their departure. Therefore, they can only force themselves to justify Germany's acts of aggression. This is three.

In addition, some other chaotic phenomena have led some people to form the impression that the European situation may just pass in this way, without resolution. This is really unavoidable.

So, will the European situation really end without resolution? If not, what will the future hold?

I say, no, definitely not. The European situation will definitely not end here. It is currently in a period of brewing another major disturbance. The time of its unveiling may not be far away. Because the fascist countries have not given up on aggression, and the democratic countries still cannot cooperate thoroughly, the friction and agitation between the two are ultimately unavoidable.

As for the result of this disturbance, it is naturally still impossible to predict. It still depends on whether the democratic front is strong and whether there is a clear determination to deter fascist aggression. Therefore, during this period, we can only pay close attention to various developments and listen to the next installment.

### Package

— Dong Fang

District Chief Zhou knew that Sergeant Yi was asking him to go on patrol outside the city, and he was very unwilling. He held a bowl of white fungus soup and stirred it non-stop with a small silver spoon, staring blankly at the white, steaming vapor, lost in thought. Concubine Wang leaned against the door, watching with amusement. She casually flicked the light switch, and the room immediately darkened. District Chief Zhou startled and pushed the bowl away from the table, wanting to dodge, but he heard a string of flirtatious laughter. He realized it was Concubine Wang. Then the light came back on, and he sat down again. Concubine Wang, gaily dressed, rushed over. District Chief Zhou picked up the bowl again and said, both angry and loving:

"This kind of joke isn't funny. The police chief was just assassinated, and my life is hanging in the balance. Don't just mess around..."

"Stop it, who told you to take this stinking job!" Concubine Wang came closer, opening her mouth, her powdered face white and red. Then she asked, "Is it sweet enough?"

District Chief Zhou tremulously offered a spoonful and delivered it to Concubine Wang's mouth. Outside the door, Zhang Ma lightly called, "Sir!"

District Chief Zhou hastily pushed Concubine Wang away, put down the bowl, and solemnly asked:

"What is it?"

Zhang Ma solemnly held a paper package, walked to the table, and presented it to District Chief Zhou with both hands. Concubine Wang took it, but immediately placed it on the table, her lips curling:

"Agh, it's so heavy!"

District Chief Zhou examined the package while listening to Zhang Ma:

"The doorman sent it in, saying it was delivered by a young man. When asked if he wanted a receipt, he said no, no, and turned around and left."

A young man, not wanting a receipt, with no writing on the package, and so heavy! He trembled as he carefully untied the rope, but the knot was tight, and he couldn't untie it for a while. Concubine Wang lost patience and snatched it over, wanting to tear it open, clumsily and heavily. District Chief Zhou became anxious and hurriedly pressed Concubine Wang's hand:

"Be careful, be careful, it might be a bomb!"

Hearing this, Concubine Wang was frightened and withdrew her hand, rushing over to hug District Chief Zhou, her powdered face pale, scolding Zhang Ma:

"Why didn't you ask clearly where it came from? What's inside? And you just brought it in so carelessly..."

District Chief Zhou frowned, reaching out to still untie the knot, constantly saying:

"Don't make a fuss, don't make a fuss, how can that be! If it's not a bomb, won't people laugh at us to death! If it spreads to the squad, they'll have even more to mock. The doorman is also absurd, why didn't he ask clearly?"

Concubine Wang blocked him with both hands, not allowing him to move. The two were in a chaotic mess.

Suddenly, the phone on the wall rang. Zhang Ma went to answer it, holding the receiver high, calling:

"Sir, a phone call from Counselor Zhao's residence."

Concubine Wang jumped up, released District Chief Zhou, rushed over, took the receiver, pressed it to her ear, and gasped:

"Oh, it's you, hey, it's me... Asked who sent it? What?... Braised beef from Da Ting?... Okay, okay, received it, but haven't opened it yet. Why didn't you bring it yourself?... Oh! Okay, is the master in? Asleep..."

District Chief Zhou snatched it over, but she had already hung up the receiver, laughing, patting District Chief Zhou's shoulder, saying:

"Little Zhao came from Beijing, bringing braised beef from Da Ting. He had his nanny's son deliver it. That child is naive, put it down and left without asking for a receipt. He was worried, so he called to ask."

District Chief Zhou breathed a sigh of relief. Zhang Ma understood, took the white fungus soup bowl, and quietly retreated.

### Sound of Attack

### Heart's Words

— Wen Zongshan

The heart is carved from crystal and glass, and heart's words, like its radiance, forever shine in the darkness.

After a robber steals objects, or a petty thief snatches small things, on the surface, they will congratulate themselves on their victory, but in their hearts, they are still warning themselves: "This is danger, extreme danger, a dark shadow is reaching out to grab you!" Heart's words always follow unchanging laws, treat themselves with honesty, and never use deception or concealment to ridicule and bully others.

Anyone, in the evening or morning, certainly has heart's words monitoring them, heart's words questioning them; after doing wrong, they then repent.

Heart's words are like a great bell, using a huge sound to awaken the deaf and enlighten the blind. When we do things that are righteous and just, it will be happier than you. Conversely, all evil deeds will cause it to advise and scold you first.

When a person falls into the abyss of "profit" and "position," heart's words are like a grass rope that will forever hold onto them. However, the heavy body itself does not pull back its feet. As a result, it still falls, and drowns.

When an aggressor picks up a full glass of fine wine to celebrate "victory," heart's words leap in its chest, saying: "Danger! Failure! Danger! Failure!"

Friends, what words are your hearts warning you of every day?

### Earth

— Ai Ding

(I)

Son of the Earth,

Stepping on the roots of the jungle,

Hiding in the mountains and forests,

The wilderness is his chest,

The wide rivers are his thick arms.

He is laughing,

Striving to snatch from the world

Seeds of victory.

(II)

Seeds of the Earth,

Strong, tough,

Sown throughout the wilderness,

The magnificent strange flowers

Are blossoms of victory.

### Not Contrary

— Ya Lu

Not contrary to the Three Principles of the People, not contrary to the government's laws and decrees, not contrary to the interests of the nation and the people – these are the first three of the twelve articles for the people in the General Mobilization of the National Spirit Outline. Anyone who understands the meaning of the General Mobilization of the National Spirit will certainly not overlook these two questions.

For conditions that are beneficial to the nation and the people, not having any actions that are contrary can certainly be considered a good citizen, but strictly speaking, in this time of war, merely achieving the extent of not being contrary seems insufficient. We must go a step further and earnestly implement the Three Principles of the People, the government's laws and decrees, and matters that increase the interests of the nation and the people.

However, if we want to implement these three tasks, we must have a deep understanding of them. First, we must know that the Three Principles of the People is the principle of saving the nation, because its goal is first to seek the liberation of the nation, second to seek the freedom of civil rights, and third to seek equality of people's livelihood. Currently, the most important task for China is the war of resistance for national liberation. Once the nation is liberated, the freedom of civil rights and the equality of people's livelihood can be easily solved. But if we want to implement the Three Principles of the People, we must recognize our country's position, enhance our national consciousness, and more importantly, have a spirit of loyalty to the country, loyalty to work, and loyalty to the people, and contribute our talents and resources as much as possible to the struggle for national liberation.

The second point regarding the government's laws and decrees is that we must not only not violate them, but also do our best to implement them. The General Mobilization of the National Spirit Ordinance is the most urgently needed to be implemented at the current stage. Chairman Chiang had already said: "After the War of Resistance has entered the second phase, the enemy is already in a dilemma militarily, becoming more and more embarrassed and more and more at a loss every day; recently, the enemy has focused on political manipulation, fabricating facts, and alienating the people, with no other purpose than to subdue our spirit first, decompose our spirit, and then conquer our entire nation..." Therefore, with this General Mobilization of the National Spirit Ordinance, it should be sufficient to inspire the people's aspirations, enhance the people's understanding of the country, strengthen the people's belief in victory, and revitalize the people's spirit of resistance, so that the enemy's political conspiracies and means of shaking and numbing will have nowhere to use their tricks.

The third point is to implement the issue of enhancing the interests of the nation and the people. To view personal interests as higher than the interests of the nation and the people is truly a selfish and self-interested concept. The ancients said, "When the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to?" This means that the people and the country have a relationship of mutual dependence. If the country reaches a point where it cannot survive, the people will not be able to enjoy the benefits of living and working in peace, and will be treated as slaves. Therefore, the interests of the country should be regarded as higher than everything else. China is now resisting aggression for survival, and we should concentrate our efforts on all work that is beneficial to the country's interests. Because after the country is restored, the people will be able to enjoy endless benefits.

The War of Resistance will surely be victorious, and the nation-building will surely be successful. We must earnestly implement the General Mobilization of the National Spirit, not only not be contrary to it.

### Random Mountain Musings

— Chi Qiang

I went to the mountains not to recuperate, nor did I intend to write articles; therefore, for lodging, I did not look for desolate, ruined temples and ancient monasteries, and there was no need for "deep flowers and trees in the Zen room."

"It has been a long time, not just a day" - the scholars of the world seem to have generally agreed on this: poverty can cause illness; illness can illuminate one's writing. It seems that one must be poor to get sick, and one must be sick to speak of "fighting wits like a trapped beast" and achieve the effect of "work." And without mountains, one would be letting down one's impoverished bones and diseased body. Moreover, not only would it be insufficient to make the article magnificent and powerful, but there would also be no place to use one's tenderness and attachment; it's as if...

Therefore, mountains belong to the noble, the refined, and the men of letters. To say that mountains are a treasure trove of articles, and that the key of illness is needed to unlock them, may not be impossible!

However, I have never envied the batch of by-products harvested from the high mountains, flowing water, sickbeds, and dregs of medicine, which are said to be satisfactory. However, if an article is to be "well-crafted," it should first be able to withstand "poverty"; "poverty" must be able to endure illness; and "illness" must go to the mountains to open up the path of writing. This seems to be the only consistent shortcut for a group of literati throughout the ages to rise to prominence and achieve success.

But I have none of these. Even if I am poor, I am not willing to boast of my poverty to achieve an effect of elegance through reverse propaganda; although how can one "express one's aspirations," and without sick moans, one is unlikely to be willing to muddle through. Moreover, relying solely on a few ribs of pleurisy, even if one can really go to the edge of the literary world for a stroll, one still has to beware of stumbling blocks, which could overwhelm one's weak body, perhaps harming the text and misleading the world!

Therefore, I am very ashamed to enter the mountains this time, because there is no reason at all to be ill. Going to the mountains without illness seems like a nominal position, receiving pay for nothing, and not doing any work. However, damn it, once I enter, I enter so deeply. Although the predecessors advocated "entering the mountains, fearing not to go deep enough," I, who have no intention of "building a famous mountain career," always feel in vain! Even if no one criticizes me for wasting the overlapping mountains and secluded valleys, I often feel a little ashamed of "holding a position without contributing" to the nodding peaks and emerald-green, affectionate wasp waists and crane knees, because I have not "worked hard while sick." Even if not, the stubborn spirit of refusing to "avoid the path of inflammation" (inflammation refers to all bronchitis or pleurisy) has already committed the unpardonable sin of pretending to be cultured!

If there is any truth to the saying that a sound career resides in a sound body, then at least writing an article requires a sound body; a good article requires a good body, so what does lung disease and spitting blood have to do with it?

Thinking of Sima Qian ascending Mount Tai and peeping into Mount Kongtong, it was probably not a "lying travel," and besides, there was no road network at that time, and there would not have been cars winding up to the top of the mountain like those in Huangyan, Taizhou, or the Yunnan-Guizhou area, so the grandeur of the article still depended on a vigorous spirit and light feet.

Although some people say that it was the melancholy after his mutilation that dispersed into writing, we must not underestimate that "palace punishment." Which of the world's many literati does not covet women, which one does not play with women, writing erotic passages, and passing on the splendor and extravagance to future generations? Naturally, "write what you are familiar with" is a dogma of predecessors enlightening later students, but being familiar with the powder team and praising the snow-white thighs in a "deviation together and reversal" manner is ultimately a foolish thing that is difficult and unrewarding.

Although I do not advocate that everyone can write articles only after being "palace punished," poverty and disease do not necessarily produce good works; therefore, my entry into the mountains this time has nothing to do with these, and the opening remarks of the random mountain musings have actually led to these irrelevant and illogical thoughts, which is unavoidable.

### Yi Feng Drama Troupe Comforts Lone Army

— Jing Lu

The Yi Feng Drama Troupe is the most sound and progressive troupe in the Peking Opera circle in Shanghai. Under the leadership of the troupe leader, Zhou Xinfang, all the members are advancing along the right track, showing their foresight everywhere, and always running ahead of their fellow actors. Recently, they felt that all circles were donating money or buying goods to comfort the lone army of the Four Banks, but only the acting circle had never expressed anything to these loyal and brave soldiers, so they initiated a donation to make a visit of condolence.

After everyone generously donated, a total of thirty-two yuan and thirty cents were raised. Although it was a very small amount, their spirit is worthy of admiration. They took this money to Yutai and bought twenty catties of tea, and the day before yesterday at 3 pm, five gentlemen, Li Wenjun, Cao Mukun, Wang Zhonghu, Wang Peichen, and Sun Delin, were sent as representatives to the lone army camp.

After they arrived at their destination, Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan was unable to meet them due to illness, and was represented by a brave warrior Lei Xiong, a deputy battalion commander and company commander, who expressed his admiration for their enthusiasm and reported in detail the heroic experience of resisting the enemy in the Four Banks. Finally, he issued a receipt for receiving twenty catties of tea. The five representatives visited inside for a week, and after asking the warriors to sign the commemorative album, they bid farewell and returned with satisfaction.

When the Yi Feng Drama Troupe initiated the donation, Zhang Yipeng and Li Ruilai of the Grand Stage also expressed their willingness to join, but Yi Feng was visiting in the name of the troupe, so they did not accept it, and hoped that the comrades of the Grand Stage could also initiate a visit. Zhang and Li are both progressive young people, and of course they will not allow Yi Feng to monopolize the beauty. I further hope that the entire acting circle will automatically initiate it.

### Chaplin Announces Dictator Plot

— Chan

"The Dictator," which is currently in production, is the most watched film, and the scope of attention is not limited to Hollywood, but to the world, and even Hitler is closely watching it.

"The Dictator" is attracting attention: first, because this is Chaplin's first film in four years since "Modern Times"; second, in this film, Chaplin officially speaks; third, in this film, there is a very humorous and sharp satire on the head of a certain dictatorship.

Regarding the film "The Dictator," this magazine has had several reports. In the past: all we knew was that the story of "The Dictator" would be set in a country ruled by a certain dictator. Chaplin plays two important roles in this film, one is a prisoner in a concentration camp, and the other is the dictator of this country.

At the beginning of March this year, the film was officially started. A reporter interviewed him about the news of the film and Chaplin's own opinions. At that time, Chaplin only said: "I don't want to tell you for the time being, but I would like to let you know that there will be a big scene in this film, which requires a lot of actors, and I would like to hire as many Jews and Germans as possible."

Now, Chaplin has publicly announced the content of "The Dictator." The script was written by an unknown British writer living in Los Angeles, and is named "The Dictator," and another name is: "The Story of a Small Fish in a World Full of Sharks." As for the plot? It is about the adventure story of a "fool" named Charlie.

The general situation of the story is like this:

"In 1912, the two countries of 'Batania' and 'Eria' went to war. 'Fool' Charlie was a soldier in the 'Batania' army. When the war ended, he was the only survivor in the team. When he returned to 'Battitude', the capital of 'Batania', everything had changed, and it was very different from before the war. One day, he was napping when he was suddenly awakened by a team of advancing troops who were whipping the people to 'support' the dictator Heel of the 'Batania' country. Startled, Charlie fled into a restaurant. The restaurant owner invited him to eat for free, but as a result, all the restaurant's furniture was destroyed by the advancing troops, and Charlie was sent to a concentration camp by the army. But one day he escaped, and from then on he had good luck. That day, the dictator Heel was on a private visit, and because the two looked alike, the guards mistook Charlie for their head, while the real dictator Heel entered the concentration camp on the charge of impersonating the head of state. Charlie had good luck, gave a speech to the people, and his beautiful speech made the whole country happy... The ending is: 'Fool' Charlie woke up from his dream and found that he was still detained in the concentration camp..."

After reading the content of this script, we already know who the satirical target of this film is. Of course, the jokes in the whole film must be very rich. No wonder that after Chaplin announced the general content of this film, the entire American movie fans paid more attention to this "Dictator."

This film started shooting in early March, and the larger one will be released in September this year. At that time, the movie fans' joy and the dictator's anger must be predictable. Let's wait and see!

### Flower News in the Broadcasting Circle (5)

— Bi Hua

(4) Shanghai Opera

Shanghai Opera is now popular for a while. Not only is it broadcasting, but also performing on stage is crowded. The reason is that it is a local style, and the lyrics are popular, so anyone can understand it. It is said that women love to listen to Shanghai Opera the most. The former Shanghai Opera was too vulgar, but now it has been improved a lot. Shanghai Opera is also called Dongxiang Tune, and also called Bentan. In the past, it was popular in small plays, but now it focuses on whole books. There are so-called four diamond king for singing Shanghai Opera, that is, Shi Chunxuan Shi Wenyun Xiao Wenbin Xiao Yuezhen Wang Xiaoxin Wang Yaqin Liu Ziyun Yao Suzhen, and many other famous ones, such as Fan Lingzeng Ding Huiqin Shi Xiaoying Wei Mingqi, etc.

(5) Singing

Most people who turn on the radio to listen to singing are young men and women and school students. Those old and confused people and kind grandmothers who recite the name of Buddha will never listen to singing. There are also a few songs that are very meaningful, and there are also a few songs that are too unconscious, and listening to them makes people feel numb, nothing more than love between men and women. We always hear the ladies who broadcast songs on the radio making a kind of giggling sound, unintentionally telling the audience that they are teasing their boyfriends who are ordering in the dark. These ladies who hope to broadcast songs should be more serious and don't make the audience hate them. Now there are many singing clubs popular in the broadcasting circle, such as Yiyou Club, Linlang Club, Comet Opera Club, Star Orchestra, Jialu Club, Brothers Club, Dawn Club, Phoenix Club, Liuying Opera Club, White Crane Club, China Club, Chinese Opera Club, Guangyi Club, Datong Club, Shanghai Club, Oriental Club, Wuyin Club, Era Club, Rongkang Club, Liangyou Club, Jazz Club, Zhiyin Club, Baiguang Club, etc., among which the Jazz Club has the oldest brand and the most talents.

(6) Siming Storytelling

The audience of Siming Storytelling are mostly old grandmothers who eat vegetarian food and recite the name of Buddha. Compared with singing, it is the opposite. The scripts that are broadcast are all stories of cultivating immortals, attaining Taoism, and exhorting good and punishing evil. The plot is consistent, and it does its best to perform the joys and sorrows of separation and reunion, persuading the world and promoting morality, which also attracts the attention of the general good men and women. It also occupies a considerable position in the broadcasting circle. The strong players in this area are Zhang Renxin, He Guizhang, Li Maochun, Zai Gongxia, Tang Jianying, Zhao Xiaoben, Bao Xiaowen, and Xiao Xianmin, etc. Zhang Renxin has the most tricks, and the Ningbo audience is mostly obsessed with him.

(7) Siming Art

Siming Opera, that is, Ningbo Tanhuang, also known as Yongtan, used to be vulgar and unbearable, but since it entered the broadcasting circle, it has been slightly reformed, but when performing on stage, it relapses. If the host can gradually improve it, it may not be a good local opera. Those who can stand in the broadcasting circle are Xiao Fengxian, Sun Cuie, Chuan Caixia, and Jin Cuixiang, etc., who sing more elegantly.

(8) Southern Opera

Southern Opera, also known as Southern Opera, did indeed shine on the radio a few years ago, but because it stuck to the old and did not reform, it has now failed. The only survivors are Gu Bingcheng, Zhang Bingren, and Yang Bingzhang. Compared with the era of rising wind and clouds in the past, the vicissitudes of the world are really sighing.

### Talking About Old Books and Old Dramas — The Complete Battle of Puguan

— Wu Jiangfeng

The "Battle of Puguan" in old dramas originally included the sections of the young master escaping from disaster, being besieged and moving troops, until the aid arrived and the thieves were captured. This drama is the most wonderful historical masterpiece, but unfortunately, very few people perform it now, and even if there are, they mostly only sing the section of Wang Ba killing his concubine to reward the army. The famous female actress Zhang Eyun is excellent in singing and martial arts. She specially connects the historical facts of Liu Xiu's wife Guo, Wang Ba's concubine Xu Yanzhen, the garrison general of Puguan, and Geng Chun's son Geng Er, and makes them the central characters. After a long period of research, this drama is reorganized into the most magnificent historical drama, with extremely complex literary and martial arts interludes. Eyun personally plays two roles, namely Xu Yanzhen, Wang Ba's concubine in the first part, and Geng Er in the latter part. The role of Geng Er is of a cross-dressing young man nature. Like this, suddenly wearing a hairpin and suddenly wearing a hat, both literary and martial, one person plays two roles with different styles, which can be called heavy and strenuous, and the courage is amazing. In today's female actress team, there may be no one who is more courageous than Zhang Eyun, who is not afraid of fatigue. The plot is recorded as follows:

After the Han Dynasty destroyed Mang, the generals were afraid of Liu Xiu's Yingming and established Liu Xuan as emperor, and sealed Xiu Xiao Wang.

### Dance Hall Miscellaneous News

— (Peng Lu)

Since Wang Hanlun and Zhou Meimei of the Xianle Dance Palace on Jing'an Temple Road have been playing the latest world-renowned songs by the singing saint Luo Ping and Miss Jin Sangzi Carmen, the grand occasion has been in vain every night. Starting last night, the contemporary famous stars Miss Wang Hanlun and Miss Zhou Meimei have returned to the palace to dance. According to the two red stars, Wang Zhou was originally waiting for education in the palace, but since she stopped dancing due to illness, it has been a long time. Now that she has recovered and danced again, she is more charming and healthy than in the past. Also, the giant star Huang Dimeidi (ie, Didi of Haishu Building) who is popular in Hong Kong and Shanghai is approved to return to the palace for dancing tomorrow (26th), which is really good news for the dance country.

Dance Country's Pride Xiao Meili The dancer Xiao Meili in the Central Dance Hall can truly be called the pride of the dance country. She always shines brightly and never dims a bit. The conditions for the success of a red dance star are multifaceted. Xiao Meili has such a position because she has a clear voice and a slender figure, and at the same time her dancing skills are also pure and she treats people kindly. Recently, Xiao Meili's Fangzi suddenly disappeared from the dance floor of the Central Dance Hall, which naturally made people suspicious. Could it be that Xiao Meili disappeared? Some said that she had been hired by someone to hide in the Golden House. However, these rumors and rumors are not accurate. The reflection of the facts is that she will still re-enter the Central Dance Hall for dancing tonight (26th), which will of course make the comrades in the dance country ecstatic.

"Chess Garden" is temporarily closed for one day due to crowded manuscripts

### Characters in Small Theaters (Middle)

— Man Fu

Chang Le's Department

The Chang Le Theater was created in the autumn of last year. The front desk is hosted by amateur actors Xu Yanqiu and Jin Yongjian. It is of course remarkable to run a "small theater" as an amateur actor. The roles recruited are very good, but the base is too weak.

Le Di is a disciple of Chou Yuexiang. Chou is the enlightenment teacher of Meng Xiaodong, a female actor and Lao Sheng master. It is not true that Le Di and Meng Xiaodong are sisters, but they are actually fellow apprentices. Her singing is better than her acting. The play "Visiting Mother and Returning to Order" is always sold out every time it is performed. The rest, such as "Going to Heaven" "Zhuli Zhai" and "Qi Yuan Bao" are all called her specialties, and people in the know all praise it.

Zhu is also a female actor and Lao Sheng. Her acting is better than her singing. The plays of the Qipai style, such as "Chasing Letters" "Running the City" "Sweeping Pines" and "Fighting Song", are very good. She is only nineteen years old and is the daughter of the famous "Begonia Red" who used to be famous in the chrysanthemum department.

Dong Zhilan plays Qingyi Hua Dan. She is the palm pearl of the famous martial artist Xiao Lanting. She is not very well-dressed, but her voice is very good. She does not study the words well. In the play Magu Xian Shou, she steps on a giant ball with both feet, and dances a silver plate with each index finger. It is rare among female actors.

Hua Meirong is eighteen years old, and her appearance is like Zhang Wenqin, a famous female actor in Jiangnan. She is the niece of the famous teacher Ma Baogang and the pianist Ma Baoge. Her art is taught by her aunt Hua Xiangrong. Her dress and voice are both acceptable. She learned drama at the age of twelve, and performed on stage at the Kaiming Grand Theater in Suzhou at the age of fifteen. From Xiao Guanghan to Era, and then to Chang Le, she has many years of stage experience. Recently, she worshiped Xu Yanqiu as her adoptive father. Her Qingyi plays are better than her Hua Dan plays.

Xin Yanlou, whose real name is Xin Yanlou, is a female martial artist and martial artist. Her fighting is extremely "strong" and "killing". Some people praise her as the female Liu Hanchen, but unfortunately she is meticulous in her voice and is not good at singing.

Wang Cuiyun is the daughter of Wang Yuanneng, the originator of the solo comic opera. She learned Qingyi Hua and Dan, but unfortunately she learned drama too late. She only started at the age of eighteen, and came on stage at the age of nineteen. She performed in Jiangxi and came to Shanghai the following year to join the Xinxin Stage for a year. She is now twenty-three years old. She looks better when she is undressed than when she is dressed up. Wang Yuanneng was famous in the Shanghai entertainment industry in the past, and he was called "a generation of artists". His orphan does not pass on his mantle, but is frustrated in a small theater, and is not valued by others. She is pitiful and her situation is also pitiful.

Fu Lixia and Fu Cuixia, one is seventeen years old and the other is fourteen years old. They are female disciples of Fu Xianfang, a former Lao Dan. They both learn Dan. At first, they learned art from Xianfang's daughter Yunxia. Lixia is quite skilled in martial arts, and can sing and perform in dramas such as "Thirteen Sisters" and "Rainbow Pass". After Yunxia married and died suddenly, her plays were taught by Xianfang himself. As for Cuixia, because she is still young, she only borrows the stage to sing.

Gui Yunfeng was a famous female martial artist 20 years ago, and was as famous as Zhang Wenyuan and Zhang Shaoquan. Later, she changed to Xiaosheng. From the perspective of stage experience, she can be called a senior among female Xiaosheng.

The rest, such as Yang Chunyan, Hu Baoting, and Liu Shaochun, are all commendable. The Chang Le Theater is relatively small, but the front and back stages are very harmonious, and the business is very prosperous. It is said that the owner of the theater will improve the seats from May 1st for the sake of innovation, and replace all of them with leather-padded new chairs, which is a highlight for small theaters, and will also invite famous characters to strengthen the lineup.

### Public Works Bureau Meeting Minutes

(Seen in the Shen Bao of the fourth month of the eleventh year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)

Last night, the English Public Works Bureau held a meeting. Various merchants and gentry were present. The Consul took the floor and said: "The gathering of esteemed merchants and gentry here indicates several important matters, all of which are pressing current affairs. I urge you to carefully consider and thoroughly plan them. One of these is to raise the silted areas of the Huangpu Bund and build a road." The head of the English Public Works Bureau, Bao Shun Dong, rose and stated: "There are three options for filling the Huangpu: One, using water as a foundation, tightly draining the seabed to create a base that also resists water pressure, and then piling mud, sand, and stones to level it, which is estimated to cost 178,000 taels of silver. Two, using tightly packed stones as a base, combined with [illegible], to establish a foundation, and then completely filling it in, which is estimated to cost 255,000 taels of silver. As for building a charity bridge and providing a charity ferry at the mouth of the Wusong River, those costs are not included in these figures. For this project, we must first plan the necessary funds before we can proceed. Otherwise, it will be just empty talk." It was found that the Public Works Bureau collects a total of 220,000 taels in various donations each year, while annual expenditures amount to 206,000 taels, leaving a surplus of only 14,000 taels. Using this for the project would leave a significant shortfall. The matter was temporarily shelved, it was said.

### Horse-Drawn Carriage Collides with Water Pipe

Last night at nine o'clock, a Westerner riding a horse-drawn carriage outside the Old North Gate in front of Wang Yu Tai Tea Shop had a water-powered lamp. Due to the horse's speed, it was difficult to [illegible], resulting in a collision that broke the pipe into two pieces. The valve connected to the gas line could not be closed, causing gas to fill the air, obscuring the sky and moon like fog and clouds, causing a stir. Fearing a fire, everyone was terrified! It was not until the foreign police arrived that the carriage was apprehended. The driver's name was obtained, and he agreed to pay six silver dollars in compensation for the repairs. The gas leak was then sealed, and the carriage was allowed to leave.

### Cotton Yarn - Hong Kong Dealers Actively Procuring - New High Prices Found in Cotton Yarn - 20-Count Double Horse Reaches 407 Yuan - Various Dealers Transact in Slightly Less Than 4,000 Bales With Counterparts

The bullish trend in the yarn market has resurfaced, largely because demand from [illegible] dealers in South China remains weak. However, procurement from Guangxi dealers is robust. A certain Xing Firm from Guangdong is purchasing on their behalf, transporting the yarn from Guangzhou Bay, Beihai, and other places. The main focus is on the 20-count Double Horse and Flying Woman brands. Confidence is high, and the market is active. At the same time, inland cloth factories are also actively trading in medium-grade 20-count Chinese yarn. As for fellow merchants, in view of the improving environment, their buying sentiment has become even stronger. With this support, the market price has reached a new high in recent times. 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse stock has risen to 405 yuan. In the afternoon, the market was unusually active, rising another two yuan. The spot price for Double Horse is now 407 yuan, matching the high prices seen in unofficial trading earlier this year.

The current state of yarn: At the opening bell this morning, the market was calm. Hong Kong dealers were actively looking to buy, and the opening price rose by 1.5 yuan. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse was 401.5 yuan. Shortly after, out-of-town dealers were particularly eager to buy in the market, focusing on the Double Horse and Flying Woman brands. Market sentiment immediately became tense, and trading was heavy. As a result, spot goods became increasingly scarce. Speculators, seeing the tight supply and difficulty in buying, rushed to buy warehouse warrants. The prices of spot goods and warehouse warrants rose one after another. By the closing price, 20-count Double Horse was 405 yuan, and the warehouse warrant price was 399 yuan. In the afternoon, because Hong Kong dealers still had [illegible], the price of Double Horse jumped another 2.5 yuan. It is estimated that all dealers bought a total of 3,945 bales throughout the day. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose 7.5 yuan, while other grades rose 2-3 yuan. The factory offered 500 bales of 7-count Red Wanzi from the New Life Factory at a price of 300 yuan, for July to September delivery. The Li Tai Factory offered 150 bales of 18-count Awake Lion at a price of 352.5 yuan, and another 400 bales at 354 yuan. Today, 410 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Tianjin, 80 pieces to Yantai, 135 pieces to Xiamen, 190 pieces to Shantou, 810 pieces to Hong Kong, 570 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 70 pieces to Beihai, and 670 pieces to Haiphong. The amounts purchased by each dealer are listed on the left:

Hong Kong: 0; Counterparts: 990; Inland: 1,305

Tianjin: 365; Shantou: 345; Total: 3,945

The Japanese yarn market, after days of heavy buying and squeezing, has become calmer and more relaxed. It is said that the factories are offering a large supply to meet the demand from all sides, which has helped to curb the bullish momentum. The price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn for this month is 373 yuan, and for next month, 375 yuan, a decrease of 2-3 yuan compared to the previous day.

### The Cotton Yarn Market Has Been Thriving Last Week

During the week from the 16th to the 22nd, the cotton yarn market continued to advance, and the bullish trend was strong. Due to the favorable situation, confidence has been boosted, and the demand for cotton yarn and cotton cloth from South China has been continuous. This has significantly improved the actual situation, and the yarn market has been thriving. The peak price for 20-count Double Horse yarn reached 404 yuan (note: yesterday it reached 407 yuan), a new high for this year. However, by the weekend, the situation in Fujian Province became tense, and yarn and cloth shipments were suddenly suspended. The market situation suffered a setback, and prices weakened. As a result, 20-count Double Horse yarn still rose by 3.5 yuan.

The spot yarn market was still relatively strong, and the number of transactions increased slightly. However, due to the ongoing efforts to evacuate the population in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas, procurement by dealers from that region was constrained, and freight services were suspended, resulting in a quiet market. However, with the high price of Japanese yarn, cotton mills in the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have begun to purchase and use cheaper Chinese and English yarn. The volume of spot yarn traded during the week is listed below (unit: bales):

Counterparts: 4,875

South China: 4,070

Inland: 1,455

North China: 300

Other: 90

Total Weekly Transaction Volume: 10,790

### If U.S. Cotton Export Subsidies Are Implemented - Domestic Cotton Prices Will Become More Expensive - The Senate Is Said to Be Strongly Opposed - Local Cotton Transactions Limited to Small Quantities of White Bales - Another 30,000 Bales of Indian Cotton Arrived Yesterday

The foreign cotton market: It was widely rumored in the New York cotton market yesterday that the U.S. government's newly established export subsidy of 2 cents per pound, capped at 7 million bales, will be implemented starting on July 1st. Details were reported in yesterday's Shen Bao. Dealers believe that with the implementation of export subsidies, the price of U.S. cotton sold abroad will be cheaper than other cotton due to government subsidies, and its export volume will increase significantly. Domestic cotton inventories will also decrease as a result, and U.S. cotton will regain its past prosperity. As a result, New York soared by 20 [illegible] pounds. Other cotton markets were greatly affected by the U.S. government's subsidized U.S. cotton export plan, and cotton prices fell across the board. Indian cotton fell sharply by 2 rupees, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 30 [illegible] pounds. If the U.S. cotton export subsidy can be implemented, New York will rise again, while the cotton markets in India, Egypt, and Liverpool will continue to fall. However, according to the latest news, a certain firm received a special telegram stating that the U.S. cotton export subsidy would not easily reduce U.S. inventories unless cotton prices were reduced to 9 cents upon export. At the same time, overseas buyers of U.S. cotton would receive a 2-cent subsidy, while domestic consumers of cotton in the United States would instead pay a higher price to buy U.S. cotton, creating a distorted situation. In the future, the United States may export U.S. cotton and import foreign cotton, because buying foreign cotton in the United States will be cheaper than buying U.S. cotton. Although the export subsidy proposal has been passed by the Department of Agriculture, according to a certain congressman, the Senate will strongly oppose this proposal. Therefore, there are still many difficulties in implementing this export subsidy.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market: Yesterday, due to the sharp rise in the New York cotton market, converted into legal currency, the price rose by 1.7 yuan. Factories adopted a wait-and-see attitude, awaiting future developments in Washington. However, a certain company still imported 2,000 bales of Brazilian cotton. Yesterday, Indian cotton fell by 5 jiao, and Egyptian cotton fell by 1.6 yuan. Prices were very cheap, but no transactions were reported. Many shipments arrived daily. Yesterday, another shipment of 30,000 bales of Indian cotton arrived. The factory delivery prices converted from yesterday's cotton market are calculated as follows:

The local cotton market was as sluggish as ever, and all parties had no significant needs. Factories have already purchased a large amount of Indian, U.S., and other cotton from overseas, which will soon arrive in Shanghai. Factory needs are more than met, so there is no urgent need to purchase local cotton. However, there are still small transactions in clean white cotton for blending and display with foreign cotton, but the quantity is small. The sources are very difficult to obtain, so the selling price is also hesitant and shows no potential, and there is nothing exciting to report. 228 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived from northern Jiangsu. The current state of spot cotton is recorded on the left:

### Finance - Gold Prices Continue to Decline - Although Xiamen Dealers Are Buying - There Is No Significant Impact

Yesterday's spot gold speculative market conditions remained weak. Gold shops and money changers continued to sell off their positions, and silver shops also followed suit. Although a certain gold shop was buying on behalf of Xiamen dealers, the supply of funds was still ample, so the underlying trend was downward. As a result, the price fell by 4 yuan.

The price of customs gold remained flat, while the price of standard English gold and other grades declined slightly.

Initially, a gold shop sold 50 taels to a spot gold shop at 2,067 yuan, the opening price, which was 2 yuan lower than yesterday afternoon's closing price. After the opening, a certain gold shop, acting on behalf of Xiamen dealers, began to buy slightly, and the situation was stable. A certain gold shop bought 50 taels from a silver shop at the same price as the morning opening. Then, it bought another 50 taels from a counterpart at 68 yuan. After this, the gold shop stopped buying and waited to see, but sellers still wanted to sell, and because it was difficult to find buyers, there were no trades for a long time. Around 11:00 AM, money changers traded 50 taels with each other at 66 yuan. Later, there were no transactions until noon, but the price remained relatively stable, so the noon closing was still 66 yuan. In the afternoon, although a certain gold shop continued to buy on behalf of Xiamen dealers, the supply of funds from [illegible] and traders remained strong, and others were not interested in buying, so the underlying trend remained weak. A certain gold shop bought more than 200 taels from money changers and counterparts at 65 yuan. The evening closing price was still 2,065 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 4 yuan compared to the previous day's noon closing. The spot gold shop's selling price for its own brand of gold was 2,070 yuan, and the buying price was 2,060 yuan. The current standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were no trades.

Silver Ornament Prices Remain Unchanged

The listed price for customs gold remained flat at 2.396 yuan, and the price of the Shanghai standard gold mark also fell by 0.3 yuan to 1,207.6 yuan.

### U.S. Dollar Notes Decline

Local British foreign exchange firms were settling accounts heavily, and banks were supplying smoothly. The market price was stable as before. Demand from U.S. [illegible] importers was not weak, but the supply from exporters was also strong, and with the pound sterling rising, the market price eased. After entering, banks absorbed smoothly and gradually returned to normal, but it was apparently stable while secretly loose. At the opening of the spot market, gold shops were selling off quite [illegible], and customer buying interest was not smooth. The opening was weak. After entering, money changers continued to sell off, and the market price was downward. In the afternoon, the selling intentions of gold shops and money changers did not weaken, and buyers were very rare. The market situation was weak. Foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds were in great demand, and there were many swap transactions among counterparts. U.S. dollar notes were in high demand and supply, and the price declined due to the easing of drafts. Hong Kong notes were strongly absorbed by various banks, and the price was also firm. French franc notes were sold more and declined slightly. Rupee notes suddenly became in demand, and the price rose the most. There were very few public association transactions. Only Qin Tai sold and Xiang Kang bought U.S. dollar notes for 500 yuan.

However, major foreign firms took advantage of the lower prices to buy, and British banks settled heavily on behalf of Japanese banks. As a result, the underlying trend turned flat again.

### Securities - Domestic and Foreign Bond Markets Flat and Weak - Stock Market Also Shows No Improvement

The securities unofficial market situation yesterday was still hovering, and its range was getting smaller. Now that all dealers are suspicious, they have not been able to cheer up, and there is a hovering trend. However, the major bulls have not yet come out of hiding, and the new bulls are mostly waiting and watching. The price is floating between 0.3-0.5 yuan, and it may not be easy to develop in the short term. Yesterday's situation: The morning opening still felt tired and depressed.

### Oil Market - Sources Available - Oil Prices Slightly Easing - Raw Oil Falls 2.5 Yuan - Soybean Oil Also Down Slightly by Around 1 Yuan

Yesterday's raw soybean oil market situation: because the sources can be accessed step by step, and Mitui announced a 25% delivery of April soybean oil futures to complete the formalities, the sentiment eased, and the panic buying has also subsided. The sharp upward trend has slightly subsided. It is estimated that 200 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded, and the price was 42.5 yuan, a drop of 2.5 yuan from the highest price on the previous day and a drop of 1.5 yuan from the closing price. 50 pieces of [illegible] soybean oil were traded, and the price was 34.7 yuan, down another 0.8 yuan from the previous market closing price. A total of 150 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were secured, and the price was 48-47 yuan, down about 1 yuan from the previous day's closing.

### Miscellaneous Grains - Joint Soybean Manipulation - Transfer from Tianjin to Shanghai - Soybean Imports and Exports Still Not Weak

Dalian soybeans are transferred from Tianjin to Shanghai, which seems to be the same as exporting soybean oil from Kobe, so merchants can understand this kind of evasive tactic, but it is difficult to apply the law to make a living under other people's poisonous hands. Yesterday's market: In addition to Dalian soybeans falling by 0.05-0.1 yuan, the other beans were still stable. It is estimated that the current Dalian soybeans are 5 cars, and the price is 9.35-9.3 yuan. Those who ship within the warehouse rental period, (separate warehouse rental) the price is 9.18 yuan and 9.15 yuan. Also, the price for Jinzhou beans (higher than [illegible] Ping Street) was 3 cars, and the price was 9.8 yuan. The price for four cars of Siping Street beans for delivery in two weeks was 9.32 yuan. More than 400 bags of Chongming sand yellow were traded, and the price ranged from 9.2 yuan to 9.08 yuan. The price for [illegible] beans was 8.85 yuan. 100 bags of Wuhu beans were secured, and the price was 9.2 yuan. 150 bags of Pinghu [illegible] beans, the price was 10.37-10.35 yuan. 50 bags of small-grain Pudong, the price was 9.2 yuan. Most of the sales were from local streets.

Exports of beans: On the 25th, 100 tons were shipped to Columbus, and on the 26th, 1,670 bags were shipped to Xiamen, 770 bags to Hong Kong, and 100 bags to Shantou. There were also 2,400 pieces of bean cake shipped to Xiamen.

### Grains - Flour Sales Active in the North - Factory Offers Expected to Increase

Factory Flour

Yesterday's spot flour trading gradually expanded. In addition to the local retail activities of the domestic merchants, the goods previously purchased by the northern merchants have mostly been loaded and shipped, and the Tianjin-Shanghai exchange rate is gradually being unified, so wholesale transactions have become active. Retail sales to southern merchants are also not weak, and there are also inquiries from various scattered gangs in the interior. The market sentiment has a turning point. The factory originally intended to call for higher prices, but some customers still felt the price was too high. In order to promote sales in the north, the original price of 4.85 yuan was still sold to northern merchants, accounting for an estimated 5-60,000 bags, and the southern local merchants also had 3-40,000 bags. The combined transaction volume reached around 100,000 bags. If retail sales continue to be active, factory offers may increase.

Foreign Flour

Yesterday's foreign flour market situation was also apparently stable and secretly tight. The foreign quoted prices remain firm as before. New futures orders remain quiet. Spot foreign flour inventories still exist, but the supply of circulating goods on the market is lacking, because those who hold the goods are firmly unwilling to release them easily. It is heard that the mid-range brands must be priced at 5.45-5.5 yuan, and high-quality goods must be priced at above 5.6 yuan. Yesterday's new transactions, in addition to local retail sales, a wholesale transaction is also in negotiation. The market situation is relatively good due to the secretly tight factory offers, so the situation is quite firm.

Export

On the 26th, flour exports included 21,000 bags to Tianjin and 10,500 bags to Xiamen.

### Out-of-Town Late Rice Inquiries from Speculators - Selling Price Better by 0.1-0.2 Yuan

Yesterday, there were inquiries from speculators for late rice from other places. Although the [illegible] arrived in both locations, because digestion was good, the market continued to improve. Wuhu [illegible] rice price was 12.9 yuan, and Nanjing [illegible] was called to 13.1 yuan. The intermediate and secondary prices uniformly followed, rising nearly 0.1 yuan and above compared to the previous market, and Wuhu [illegible] rice was especially active. High-quality goods were priced at 11.7-8 yuan, and secondary goods were 11.3-4 yuan, which was nearly 0.2 yuan higher. The total transaction volume for the whole day was also as high as about 4,000 bags. Saigon's large-grain goods were still at about 17.1 yuan, but high-quality goods were called to 17.6 yuan.

### Glutinous Rice Seller Psychology Still Strong

Yesterday, the sources of glutinous rice for various dealers, there were only four or five [illegible] River, and 2,500-600 bags for the Suzhou gang from the [illegible], and 6-700 bags from Kunshan and other gangs. After the flat and tired market situation turned tight the day before yesterday, yesterday there was still a residual wave at the start. The sellers' asking prices continued to rise, and the local and speculative sales markets were active, but they were not as enthusiastic as the day before yesterday. Therefore, although the market situation continued to rise, in addition to the high-quality [illegible] market rising by 0.1-0.15 yuan, the others such as [illegible], only improved by a few cents. The [illegible] River goods also only increased by about 0.1 yuan. [illegible] also became slightly tight. [illegible] suddenly became active, so the market price was brightened by 0.2-0.3 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Dutch Red Opens with 5,300 Bags, Arrivals Also Quite Strong

Yesterday, the Dutch red trend tightened. Xinyi Company opened 5,300 bags of transit goods at a price of $11.25. They would only open again if the market reached $11.50. Spot prices also rose to $17. Other grades of coarse white sugar remained largely unchanged. No. 24 spot sugar was $26.25 at foreign wharves and $26.50 for local. Da Jin Qian Mark was $26.80. Taikoo Car White B Mark was $26.20 at western wharves and $25.95 at eastern wharves. Zhenji No. 1 local cotton white was $26.30, with Nos. 2 and 3 each retreating half a dollar per grade. Local No. 1 crystal was $31.50. The Chaozhou guild offered fully three-tipped sugar at $24.78, top-grade crystal white at $24.50 to $23.80, and crystal flower white at $22.80, totaling over 500 bags. The Guangdong guild offered 57 bags of Huizhou white at $23.50, and 72 pieces of small basket thin flakes of green sugar at $10.02, later tightening to $10.40.

On the 25th, sugar imports included 2,500 bags from the Netherlands, 1,200 bags from Hong Kong, and 1,365 bags from Shantou.

### Dried Goods: More Xiamen Tangerine Cakes Arrive

The previous batch of Xiamen tangerine cakes had already been cleared due to demand from the northern merchants. It has now been found that the Taiyuan Wheel imported over 30 barrels last week, and customs formalities were completed yesterday, with preparations to clear them soon.

### Piece Goods: Domestic Cloth Heads Southwest, Eastern Piece Goods Thrive in the Northeast

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday, the continuous rise in Japanese yarn and cloth further increased the cost of white and dyed fabrics, stimulating the purchasing interest of hoarders and local dye factories. Guangdong merchants also began buying, boosting market confidence. Fine cloth and fine twill were offered at prices increased by about a dime per bolt. Scattered lots on the market were still being sold at the original price. Goods ordered by Zhejiang customers and those returned mid-journey while being shipped to Ou were planned to be resold in Shanghai, causing some price disparities in the market. Dye factories in northern Jiangsu and the local area purchased over one hundred pieces of fine cloth and fine twill with brands like "Cannon Cart," while wholesale shops in the local area purchased fifty or sixty pieces of Yihua and Dasheng coarse cloth. Guangdong merchants purchased nearly one hundred pieces of 11-pound Guoqing underwear, 12-pound Fugui and Dapeng fine cloth, and both light and heavy coarse cloth. Sales prices for white fine cloth and fine twill increased by five to ten cents per bolt, while coarse cloth prices remained stable. Dyed cloth, due to sluggish sales, was still being offered at the original price, catering to small transactions, with asking prices increasing by about 25 cents per bolt. The local area and merchants from the southwest and northern regions had the greatest demand. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan purchased several thousand bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth. Orders for autumn and winter printed velvet had also begun, with over one thousand bolts already being shipped. Guangdong merchants purchased over two thousand bolts of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill. Merchants from northern Jiangsu, such as Dongtai, purchased over eight hundred bolts of colored cloth and pongee. Merchants from the northern route, such as Tianjin and Qingdao, purchased over three thousand bolts of blue cloth, pongee, woolen cloth, and bleached cloth.

Eastern Cloth

Due to strong sales to northern merchants, the market for white cloth rose even more sharply. Yesterday, merchants from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other areas purchased nearly three thousand pieces of various brands of fine cloth and fine twill, including both spot and futures contracts. Local sentiment was also boosted, with transactions reaching one thousand pieces. Spot prices for fine cloth increased by 15 cents per bolt, and next month's futures contracts increased by 20 to 30 cents. Various foreign firms offered over three thousand pieces of fine cloth. Longtou orders opened at $13.55 to $13.57 per bolt, Flying Fish at $13.57 to $13.575, Yanghe at $13.565 to $13.57, Wufu at $13.55 to $13.555, and Laba at $13.555 to $13.56. The market's vigor and price levels were new records since the outbreak of the war.

Exports

Today's piece goods exports included 120 pieces to Yantai, 100 pieces to Xiamen, 65 pieces to Shantou, 280 pieces to Hong Kong, 145 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 5 pieces to Beihai, and 515 pieces to Haiphong. Yesterday's shipments to Southeast Asia included 125 pieces of cotton cloth, and 126 pieces came from Hong Kong.

### Silk and Tea: Yokohama Market Closed, Local Silk Trade Also Stalled

Overseas silk markets saw Yokohama closed due to a holiday, and New York and Lyon both reported declines. Japanese silk, 83% quality, fell by 3 cents, and 75% quality fell by 4 cents. Shanghai silk fell by 3 cents, near-term standard silk fell by 1 cent, and distant futures fell by 4 cents. Lyon Japanese silk fell by 2 francs, Shanghai silk A grade fell by half a franc, and B grade fell by 1 franc. Guangdong silk opened at the original price.

The local silk market was quiet yesterday. Yokohama's closure caused foreign firms' silk trade to lose its basis. With no remittances from overseas yesterday, manufacturers were also unwilling to send more silk telegrams, so the silk market saw no activity. This point implies the silk market's dynamics are turning toward a decline, which is a factor. Also, the lack of concrete measures for this spring's cocoon harvest is an important reason. In normal times, now would be the season for releasing this year's new silk, but after the war of resistance, it will inevitably be somewhat restricted.

On the 25th, 474 pieces of Huzhou silk, 100 pieces of silk waste, and 20 pieces of silk fabric were exported to Europe.

1,115 cases of tea were shipped to Europe, and another 51 tons were shipped to Spain. 980 cases of tea were shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and 16 cases of tea were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Fruit: Mangoes Shipped to Shanghai for Sale

Various fruits are entering a period of scarcity. However, Siamese mangoes are a suitable seasonal product. Due to their limited production, the price is relatively high. Yesterday, the Dutch ship Chizhenijia Na No. shipped 150 baskets.

Spring and Autumn

### Good News for Apprentices: Shanghai East Public Society Opens Four Obligatory Night Schools for Apprentices

— Xin Meng

Central District: 5th Floor, Cishu Building, Shanghai University

Southern District: Municipal Middle School, 5 Wuma Road, Wuhu Road Western District: Huamin Elementary School, Maitehest Road Northern District: Zhenru Elementary School, Lao Zha Bridge

We know that Shanghai University has a Mudong Public Society. Although this organization inevitably carries some religious overtones, its sole purpose is to seek welfare for the working masses. The Shanghai East Public Society has a long history since its establishment and has indeed achieved considerable success in its past work. The dedication of its staff is also admirable.

Yangshupu is a place concentrated with factories, and many male and female workers live in the nearby area. Shanghai University saw this early on and created the Shanghai East Public Society specifically for the working class. In addition to establishing primary and secondary schools and charging low tuition fees so that the children of workers can generally receive education, it also has workers' night schools and obligatory schools for workers' children. There are also considerable facilities for sports, as well as reading rooms and libraries. At the same time, they often initiate various gatherings, either to promote worker education or to seek welfare for workers. Therefore, when talking about the Shanghai East Public Society, every worker living in the Yangshupu area knows about it.

The artillery fire of "August 13" destroyed Yangshupu, and 90% of the factories were destroyed. Workers had nowhere to work, and the school buildings of Shanghai University were used as battlefields. In a state of chaos, the Shanghai East Public Society followed Shanghai University and fled to the concession area. However, after the Shanghai East Public Society moved to the south bank of Suzhou River, although everything was destroyed, all work continued within the possible range. For example, the affiliated primary and secondary schools continued to borrow school buildings for classes, and the tuition fees charged were still cheaper than those of ordinary schools. At the same time, night schools also continued to open, and an automobile school was also attached.

Recently, we received another piece of news. The Shanghai East Public Society raised donations and opened four obligatory schools for apprentices: Central District: 5th Floor, Cishu Building, Shanghai University; Southern District: Municipal Middle School, 5 Wuma Road, Wuhu Road; Western District: Huamin Elementary School, Dongxin Zha Road, Maitehest Road; Northern District: Zhenru Elementary School, Lao Zha Bridge. Classes have begun one after another. Any apprentice can register for admission, tuition is completely free, and class time is from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM every night, which does not conflict with the apprentice's working hours. In advance, the Shanghai East Public Society also sent 50 investigators to various district stores to investigate the apprentices' education level and requested managers or shop owners to allow their apprentices to study. Promoting apprentice education is not only related to the apprentice's own future, but also helps improve business, which is indeed quite important. The author sincerely hopes that wise managers and shop owners will not hesitate to allow every apprentice to study and not miss this opportunity.

### The Brave Little Soldier

Yili Zuo

### Seeing

— Tiandao

Unless you are blind, if you have eyes, you must see. However, when something blocks your path of vision, you cannot overly trust your eyeballs. There is a term in optics called "optical illusion," which often "sees" long as short and round as square. Therefore, how to "see" things in front of you and how to "see" them is worth studying.

It is said that Shanghai people have quite a bit of study when it comes to "seeing." For example, when "seeing" the coronation of the British King, even the women's trousers were "seen" crystal clear. When a big fire burned behind Songshan Road, even people living near the Great World came out in droves to watch. Moreover, after "seeing" it, there were many discussions about how this woman was ashamed and blushing, and how that woman was screaming strangely. The tongues of fire were like crows flying in the air, and the water taps were like swimming dragons. The things "seen" in the eyes are indeed real and have no "optical illusion" reaction, but is it appropriate to "see" these things this way, and is this the way to "see" them? The so-called "quite a bit of study" is actually a lack of "study."

It is precisely because people who "see" lack study that the people being "seen" are showing more and more tricks. For example, clearly wanting to earn "three million," they insist, "How can I be greedy for profit?" Clearly it's "surrender," but they come up with a set of "avoiding mutual destruction" tricks. Others, such as "closing the door to study," etc., have no concrete expression and are no different from releasing smoke screens to make people "see" the tip of a bull's horn.

How to "see" and how to "see" are worth a great deal of study and research. Relying on your sharp eyes, you break through what is blocking the path of vision, seeing everything clearly and thoroughly. Even a charming and beautiful woman will have to reveal her true form on the spot as a vixen with a tail.

Unless you are blind, you must see if you have eyes, but you must see clearly and thoroughly? Moreover, even if you are blind, you still have ears. Listen to the "chirping," and you should know which kind of "stuff" it is.

### Alas, Where Shall I Go?

— Lin Gengbai

and Lixi

Alas, where shall I go? I shall go east. The waters of Fusang can cleanse my breast. I wish to kick the setting sun until it is red. Drive out all warriors and personally labor in the fields. Collect all the gold, silver, steel, iron, and copper from the Three Slopes. Japan and China are brothers. Why are there still weapons and warfare raging? The desires of the young are endless. The senior ministers and elders are deaf in both ears. They are evasive and embarrassed with merchants and workers. Financial resources are exhausted, and levies are heaped upon levies. The army is on the rise, and nine out of ten homes are empty. Women and old men long for their husbands and sons. Sibling rivalry makes my heart uneasy. Who says that China is sure to be defeated in a long war? I am like a centipede that is not yet dead. They are like a nouveau riche family facing disaster. The superficial only hear the roar of airplanes, cannons, tanks, and cars. Fear and doubt shake their bodies. How can I get a purple aura to rise in the Sun Palace? Millions of the hammer and sickle masses sing among them. The East joins hands with the same writing and language. Descendants of the Yellow Emperor embrace the Japanese wind. The flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun flies in the sky. Under the cherry blossoms, I get drunk and empty a thousand cups!

Alas, where shall I go? I shall go south. The Pacific wind is vast and the sky is blue. All colonial lands are my land, for two or three days I am a possession of France, England, or Holland. Together with the Philippines and Hainan Island, we remotely guard the gateway to the Far East. Tall-nosed crowds fill their jaws. The tongues of the Chinese people are restrained. The Far East's power struggle can be explored here. Demands and protection are like raising silkworms. Or like a runaway horse with a bridle. There is much injustice, how can the feelings be sweet? The people are also tired, and the money is in the boxes. Brown trees, coconut trees, and rubber trees are better than medlars and nanmu. Trees are only used for greedy purposes. I only hope that the motherland produces extraordinary men. The mighty and brave can conquer the barbarians. Recently, I heard the Imperial edict on the burden of fighting. The rich and the laborers are cut down and joined together. There are people like this who are made to drink squid. I sleep soundly in my bed, while others snore. To this day, they still stare covetously. How can the lords bear to think of it? My intestines are hot and my heart is ashamed. My mouth is willing to be like a golden man's sealed lips. I want to speak out, but those who hear it suspect I'm mad!

Alas, where shall I go? I shall go west. Europe is blocked by the sea, and whales roar. Tyrants and villains cannot be aligned. Taking the neighbor's [land] as their [own] nest is like a turtle stuck in the mud. Seventy-year-old men laugh and call out. The forces of combined chickens are hard to live together. The Polish Corridor is a ladder to heaven. I will not be at odds with Czechoslovakia and Romania. I will not share the same wind and rain with Yugoslavia and Lithuania. England and France look at them like clouds and rainbows. The Soviet Union treats them like a mistress. In today's world, we can only lower our heads to Stalin, Hitler, and Mussolini. The Near East has Turkey to support. Spain is a neighborhood by the sea. Who can build a golden dyke of hundreds of millions of miles beyond North America? American women have beautiful heads and soft hands. Young people hold slingshots and compete to be close to them. The musk eventually sees its navel burned because of its fragrance. How can there be a Peach Blossom Spring outside the world? I am afraid that the earth is like glass. A thunderbolt shatters them into pieces. What is called by the night air cannot be avoided by chance. When the quality exceeds the object's limit, look at the sign. Rebels roam the land and there are many caltrops. I want to sing, but my heart is miserable!

Alas, where shall I go? I shall go north. The workers and peasants raise their arms to defend this country. In the middle is the icy sky of Siberia and the sand and gravel of the Gobi Desert. The territory is ten thousand miles, growing yellow and white. In Liaodong, there are pigs that are full of jade food. The cranes return, their feathers red. Then distant relationships are restored and re-translated. Hu and Yue see each other in the same boat. Don't be moved by the changes of the world from the Song and Yuan dynasties. The power of revenge from Wu and Chu in Qin. The way to self-strengthening lies in unceasing effort. The five-year plan is near to the model. To organize the army and defend the people is useless. Being kind is enough to save from hunger and drowning. Don't you see the people of the Soviet Union all working as servants? They share the hardships with the people every morning and evening. Likes, dislikes, punishments, and rewards do not go against the people's will. Also, do not see that the country of the Soviet Union has no corrupt officials or a single person who daydreams about fame and color, jade and silk, or building mansions. The Black River water is turbid and the misty trees are straight. Birds fly quickly by Lake Hasan. There are many borders between the two continents, and the spring breeze of Yuguan sends the Qiang flute. The carriage travels even harder, spreading its wings to the sky. I want to follow them, but I am sad. My bag has no spare money for a heroic farewell. What age is this on earth, with iron and blood? Red flags and gold compete to rise and fall!

Alas, where shall I go? I shall go forward. The strong Chinese children are in Youyan. They are also in the mountains and rivers of the two rivers, the three Jin, the hundred Yue, and the Jianghuai. Guerrilla bravery is passed on by the masses. Who pities the Red Army who died for their cause? The Huangpu children are the first to pull out the flag. Brave divisions traveled in Sichuan and Yunnan. The Red Army can turn the right into the wrong. The system is exhausted, and Sun Lang has the power, and would rather be a jade than a tile. Continue to work hard and constantly destroy the strong. Comfort those who come and stretch out their fists. I want to follow them, but my heart is blank. It is not wise to kill the enemy with a short blade. It is bitter to say that young people are expelled. Otherwise, fly a book or draft a proclamation. I will sing a song for the strong children. I will broadcast the march for the strong children to the world. I have a writing style on the cliffs like a column. When I look at my reflection in the flowing water, I am still graceful. I slightly hate the two gray hairs on my sideburns. All my life, I wanted to fly into the sky. Forward, forward, why am I drowned in the dust of the city! I don't hear gunfire, I hear pipes and strings!

Alas, east, west, north, and south, there is nowhere to go. I want to go forward, but I am afraid that there are many obstacles on the road. Alas, where shall I go? I shall stay here. From winter to summer, the sky is sad. The fog is like a screen and the rain is endless. The red sun peels the skin as if in prison. The mountains and forests are suitable for hiding and searching. Sometimes it also makes people's minds gentle. Walking on the slopes often brings out the wild fun. The shade of the trees is green and all are fields. Getting sunshine can travel and clear my eyes. There are only a few good days in spring and autumn. The fruits are not big, but the mother doesn't demand too much. Guanggan is sweet and unparalleled. When drunk, I can moisten my throat. Hundreds of thousands of displaced people come to his state. The middle class often has worries. The rich and powerful still sing and dance. High carriages and soldiers mix with cow urine. The flying thieves do not come, and they are getting used to stealing more. When people hear exaggerations, they shout in crowds. If they win, they are surprised and suspicious, and if they lose, they turn their heads. These people have never thrown themselves into the turbulent stream. A retired official idles away my plan. Half a bowl of rice supports two years a week. Also, it is said that the official is big and I want to be ashamed. The great men are tigers, and today the cuckoos nest in them. The country is shabby, and shields and spears are in sight. Alas, grass and beans are used to restrain Huailiu!

Editor's note: Mr. Lin Gengbai entered Chongqing after the war. Now, in the "Selected Poems of Today," "Alas, Where Shall I Go?" is his recent work. The author wrote in a letter to a friend: "The six chapters of the long song are very satisfying to me. I think it is an epoch-making work, which the ancients have never had. Do you think it is an exaggeration?" It can be seen that he is generally satisfied with himself.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 8: Is It Illusion or Truth? Acting on the Stage, It Is Appropriate to Move Forward or Stop, Making Home Everywhere

Jin Dànyún was very happy and said: "Mrs. Sūlǐyǎ, since this is the case, why don't you manufacture a car yourself first? To have all the equipment complete and without any shortcomings, let us open our eyes. As for your friend's car, we must first borrow it for a ride, or maybe that kind of car is not easy for us to drive?" Mrs. Sūlǐyǎ said: "Aren't we currently planning to start an automobile manufacturing company? We want to invite many engineers to come. Our company will gather many engineers to design the most suitable family car for China. Because now, although it is said that the four seas are one family, each country has different customs and habits. We don't want to imitate others. We want to come up with our own ideas and manufacture the most excellent design. Do you think that's good?" Jin Dànyún was even more excited when she heard this, and said: "That's great! Mrs. Sūlǐyǎ, but when we manufacture that kind of car, will it be exclusively for our own comfort, or will it be popularized among the public?" Mrs. Sūlǐyǎ said: "Naturally, it will be popularized among the public. Inventors have always popularized their inventions among the public; no one has ever said that they would keep it for themselves. This is the principle of evolution. You must know that many scientific inventors in the world often think hard and invent something, but they themselves do not enjoy the benefits of it at all, but instead enable future generations to enjoy endless benefits. There are many such cases. Although some countries often grant inventors a few years of patent, that is only meant as an encouragement and does not mean that circulation is not allowed. Our kind of car is of course prepared to be popularized among the public, but how do you think we should popularize it?" Jin Dànyún said: "In addition to manufacturing that kind of car for people within the automobile manufacturing company, we also set up a leasing company. That leasing company specializes in leasing that kind of car, either for family travel, for engineers, or for research in various fields of study. For example, if they need that kind of car but cannot afford to buy it themselves, or if they only need it temporarily and do not need it permanently, they can come to us to rent it. The rental period can be monthly or weekly. We can even provide drivers. Wouldn't that be very convenient for people?" Mrs. Sūlǐyǎ was moved by what she heard and wanted to try it out. She discussed with Jin Dànyún how much capital would be needed to start such a company. Jin Dànyún said: "This depends on how many vehicles the company has and the size of the area. For the sake of trying it out, let's tentatively set it at three million yuan in national currency. What do you think?" It is precisely

The lake and mountains should not be encircled by dreams, and activists often stop in the suburbs. (96)
