### The German and Soviet Armies Meet in Greater Poland; Britain and France Declare Their Determination to Uphold Their Original Intentions and Lodge a Joint Protest with the Soviet Government; Soviet Troops Mistakenly Enter Romania and Immediately Withdraw

London - The Polish government yesterday informed Britain that the Soviet Union had invaded Poland, describing the action as a "flagrant act of aggression." The note was submitted by Polish Ambassador to Britain, Count Raczynski, to British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax. The Polish Ambassador then requested Britain to fulfill its obligations to Poland in accordance with the Anglo-Polish Mutual Assistance Treaty. (September 19th, Associated Press dispatch)

London - Well-informed sources have suggested that regarding the entry of Soviet troops into Poland, the British and French governments will jointly lodge a protest with the Soviet government today, but do not intend to take any further action for the time being. (September 19th, Havas dispatch)

London - Responsible sources here have recently issued a statement condemning the Soviet invasion of Poland and reaffirming Britain's determination. They state that while Poland is unable to withstand the pressure of the German army, the Soviet Union has launched an attack, and the British government does not consider the reasons given to be justifiable. Although the full implications of this action are not yet apparent, the British government wishes to take this opportunity to declare that, with the full support of the nation, it will fulfill its obligations to Poland and continue the war with all its strength to achieve its goals. This determination will not be changed by current events. (September 19th, Reuters dispatch)

Paris - There is now no doubt about the understanding reached between Germany and the Soviet Union. Although National Socialism and Communism are theoretically opposed, they are now combined to achieve their imperialistic goals, disregarding various treaties and the principles of non-aggression to promote Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism. However, France has not yet received a formal report, only a notification from the Soviet Union stating its willingness to maintain neutrality. Therefore, the Soviet Union's intentions must be determined after further actions by that country. Although Germany is trying to exaggerate that the cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union is enough to make Western European countries declare their surrender, France considers it not worth responding to. In short, Italy originally had the possibility of mediating after Poland's defeat, but now Germany will likely speak for itself, forcing Britain and France to accept a National Socialist peace, or else fight a group stretching from the Rhine in the west to Japan in the east. However, no matter what country's assistance Germany receives, Britain and France will not stop fighting unless they destroy National Socialism. Germany's use of intimidation only shows its growing anxiety. (September 18th, Havas dispatch)

Bucharest, Romania - According to reliable sources, the Soviet troops entering Poland number between twenty-five and thirty divisions, and some have already reached major locations along the Polish-Romanian border. (September 18th, Havas dispatch)

Zurich, Switzerland - A German wireless station recently issued a message confirming that Soviet troops occupied Vilnius in northern Poland at 5:00 PM today. The city is close to the Lithuanian border. (September 18th, Havas dispatch)

Belgrade, Yugoslavia - News has recently been received from the capital of Hungary that in southern Poland, Soviet troops have reached the vicinity of the Hungarian border and exchanged greetings with the Hungarian border guards across the border. (September 18th, Havas dispatch)

Bucharest, Romania - Soviet troops who arrived at the border between Poland and Romania entered Romanian territory between Guti and Vicnai-Suceava. After being warned by the Romanian Defense Forces Commander, a Soviet officer apologized and withdrew back into Polish territory. (September 18th, Havas dispatch)

Moscow - A local radio station broadcast today that after the German and Soviet armies met at Brest-Litovsk, 180 miles east of Warsaw, they are expected to make contact in the south soon, but it will take several days to meet in the central region. According to foreign military experts, at least 500,000 to 1 million Soviet troops are participating in the invasion of Poland. Soviet troops entered Vilnius yesterday without resistance. This is the first time Soviet troops have occupied an important city. The meeting between German and Soviet troops at Brest-Litovsk was very friendly, with officers congratulating each other. When Soviet and German pilots encountered each other in Polish airspace, they waved happily to each other. The two countries will also establish a buffer Polish state.

### Germany and the Soviet Union Begin Propaganda, Threatening the Baltic States, Claiming a Certain Country is Hiding Polish Submarines; Lithuanian Foreign Minister Meets with Soviet Envoy

Moscow - The Leningrad report claims, according to reliable sources, that Polish submarines are currently hiding in the ports of several countries in the Baltic Sea and receiving secret assistance from personnel of certain governments. News has also been received that in addition to Polish submarines, submarines from other countries are also hidden in the aforementioned ports. On September 18th, a Polish submarine, originally interned in the port of Tallinn, Estonia, suddenly escaped without a trace. It is believed that this was the result of the Estonian authorities' connivance and assistance. The Soviet Baltic Fleet Command has now taken measures to prevent harassment by submarines hiding in the Baltic Sea. (September 18th, TASS dispatch)

Tallinn, Estonia - Estonian Navy Commander Mir and Navy Chief of Staff Linnaste were dismissed from their posts today by the president. This is the first measure taken after investigating the escape of the Polish submarine "Orzel" from this port, and was recommended by the Estonian Commander-in-Chief. (September 18th, Reuter dispatch)

Kaunas, Lithuania - Soviet Ambassador to Lithuania, Pozdnyakov, had a secret half-hour meeting with the Lithuanian Foreign Minister this morning. The content is kept confidential. (September 19th, Reuter dispatch)

### Polish President's Message to the People: Continue to Fight for National Restoration

Paris - After fleeing to Romania with government officials, Polish President Mościcki issued a message to the Polish people yesterday, which was released by the Polish Embassy in France. It stated: "It is well known that German forces are far superior to our own. While our troops are fighting against Germany with utmost courage, our east unexpectedly took advantage of our crisis and invaded our territory, disregarding existing treaties and moral principles. Historically, our country has been attacked on two fronts, which has no precedent, and now we are facing a double invasion. What more can be said? But we have established a treaty of alliance with Britain and France, and we will continue to fight for justice and civilization, to overcome the strong and the barbaric. We also believe that we will survive to the end. During this difficult period of struggle, it is necessary to maintain the structure of the Polish Republic. Therefore, although I am deeply saddened, I have decided to move the Presidential Palace and other important institutions to a safe area to continue exercising full sovereignty and oversee the interests of the Republic. From now on, I will share the burden with the people of how to maintain national glory." (September 18th, Havas dispatch)

### Dutch East Indies Strengthens Defense

The Hague - The report prepared by the Dutch East Indies Naval Defense Committee was released today. The report advocates building fast cruiser-battleships of 25,000 to 30,000 tons, equipped with 280 mm guns, and expanding the Surabaya naval base. (September 19th, Reuters dispatch)

Map of the German-Soviet Conspiracy to Partition Poland

London - The Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent, citing Soviet sources, says that the Soviet Union's advance into Poland is aimed at occupying the entire eastern part of Poland, up to the so-called Curzon Line. In other words, from Grodno, passing through Bialystok, Brest-Litovsk, and Przemyśl to the Carpathian Mountains. According to this "Curzon Line," which is the eastern border of the new Polish state advocated by Britain in 1920, if the Soviet Union has its way in southern Poland, the entire territory of Ukraine will be included in the Soviet Union's borders. Judging from the Soviet Union's statements, Moscow has no intention of defining a common German-Soviet border. The Soviet Union has always wanted to establish a Polish buffer state. However, it is still difficult to determine whether the Soviet Union's actions have obtained Germany's consent based on the agreement recently reached in Moscow. One more thing that can be inferred is that the Soviet Union does not want to see Germany strengthen its power on the shores of the Black Sea. The visit of Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu to Moscow is mainly focused on cooperation in Black Sea defense. Generally speaking, the Soviet Union seems to be adopting a protective stance in the southeast and west, and does not want to expand its borders except for neighboring lands threatened by a third strong country like Germany. (September 19th, Reuters dispatch)

### Balkan Situation: Turkish Ambassador Meets with French Foreign Minister; Yugoslavia Sends Envoy to the Soviet Union

Paris - Turkish Ambassador Suat met with Foreign Minister Triber this morning. After a long conversation, well-informed sources were very satisfied. It is said that "The Turkish government's position has not changed due to changes in the international situation, as can be seen from this. The negotiations between Britain, France, and Turkey regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement are still progressing smoothly. The visit of Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu to Moscow is exploratory in nature and has no other purpose. The information collected during this trip will not only benefit Turkey but will also be welcomed by Britain and France." In addition, sources have reported that the Turkish government may prohibit British and French warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits so that the Soviet Union can supply Germany with various goods via the Danube River without being intercepted by British and French warships. (September 19th, Havas dispatch)

Belgrade, Yugoslavia - It is widely rumored here that the government has sent a special envoy to Moscow with a secret mission to inquire. Sources predict that Yugoslavia's policy towards Russia will change course. Semi-official sources have neither acknowledged nor confirmed these rumors. (September 19th, Reuter dispatch)

Belgrade, Yugoslavia - Prince Regent Paul issued an order this morning granting the government full power to amend existing laws or promulgate new laws when necessary, until a new parliament is formed. (Note: The parliament was dissolved on August 27th of this year, and when elections will be held has not yet been decided.) However, all measures taken by the government under this full power shall be submitted to the parliament for ratification in the future. (September 19th, Reuter dispatch)

### Hitler Arrives in Danzig and Delivers a Speech, Denouncing the Treaty of Versailles

Danzig - Hitler arrived at the Polish border in Danzig today. Danzig National Socialist Party leader Forster greeted him there and expressed gratitude to Hitler on behalf of the people of Danzig. Hitler replied that he was very happy to meet them in this city again after it returned to Germany. The two then shook hands. After Forster addressed the people, Hitler began his speech. He said that those who witness this great day of liberation are not only the people of Danzig but also the people of the whole world. Not only do the people of Danzig feel happy, but all Germans are as happy. He himself also feels the greatness of this moment. He is now trampling for the first time on land that has been inhabited by Germans for five or six hundred years. The World War was the most meaningless of all wars, sacrificing this city and this land. In that war, everyone failed, and no one won, so everyone had a kind of confidence that this kind of fate would never be repeated in the future. Germany's participation in the World War had no war objectives but hoped that the subsequent peace would enable Germany to recover and eliminate all suffering. Unexpectedly, the result was not free negotiations but the Treaty of Versailles imposed on the German people. The warmongers at that time not only did not solve this military problem but created countless new problems. The oppressed Germany was unwilling to submit for a long time and will rise again to solve the newly created problems. The Treaty of Versailles ignored Germany as a country with 82 million people, all of whom want to live and will always live. Hitler also said that in another fifty years, Poland will return to barbarism. Poland has never been a democratic country, and its people are oppressed by tyrannical authorities. (September 19th, Reuters dispatch)

### Japanese Newspapers Have Different Views

Tokyo - The Nichinichi Shimbun newspaper group said that it is doubtful how long the current German-Soviet treaty can be maintained. Therefore, the partition of Poland may not strengthen the friendly relations between Germany and the Soviet Union. In fact, Ukraine will eventually become a point of contention between the two countries. Hochi Shimbun, which has always advocated the establishment of a military alliance with the Axis powers, took the opportunity to advocate strengthening relations between Japan, Germany, and Italy to create a new order unfavorable to Britain. Miyako Shimbun said that with the conclusion of the Japanese-Soviet armistice agreement, the Soviet Union concentrated its forces in Europe, and Britain and France withdrew from the Far East stage. Thus, the policy of encircling Japan was broken. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Japanese government to rise and complete the new order in East Asia. Chugai Shogyo Shimpo advised the government to adjust its entire relationship with the Soviet Union, saying that doing so would help resolve the China war. (September 19th, Reuters dispatch)

### Secret Agreement Between Germany and the Soviet Union to Partition Poland

London - Diplomatic officials here now believe that an agreement has been reached between Germany and the Soviet Union to divide spheres of influence within Poland. However, it is still difficult to determine whether this agreement was reached when the two sides signed the non-aggression treaty on August 24th or after the fact. The Soviet government was deeply concerned that Germany would disregard the agreement and seize the entire Poland, so it suddenly sent troops to Poland to implement the partition method stated in the agreement. Germany has probably recognized the Soviet Union's right to occupy the lands inhabited by the Ukrainian and White Russian ethnic groups, and once Poland disintegrates, it will further establish a small, independent Polish state as a buffer state between Germany and the Soviet Union. This Polish state should have a population of 18 million and be controlled by Germany and the Soviet Union. However, before it is officially established, Polish territory not occupied by the Soviet Union should be temporarily occupied by Germany. (September 18th, Havas dispatch)

Tallinn, Estonia - According to reliable sources, Germany and the Soviet Union have concluded a secret agreement, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Define the new border after the two sides partition Poland; (2) The lands inhabited by the Ukrainian and White Russian ethnic groups within Poland may be occupied by the Soviet Union; (3) Establish a small Polish state as one of the socialist republics belonging to the Soviet Union, that is, as a Soviet "protectorate". Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech yesterday that "the Polish people are in dire straits, and the Soviet government is prepared to rescue them" probably refers to this. As for the intention of Germany and the Soviet Union to regard the small Polish state as a Soviet protectorate, it is to create a situation that would make it impossible for Western European countries to continue using force unless they declare war on the Soviet Union. Regarding this, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is reportedly convinced that in this situation, Britain and France would never reject the armistice proposal to be put forward by Führer Hitler. This proposal will be presented in a form of “fait accompli.” If Britain and France reject it, then Führer Hitler would launch an attack on France without hesitation, perhaps by passing through the Netherlands or simultaneously feigning an attack through some other neutral country with lightning speed. Given that the staff of most German factories in the Netherlands have been recalled to Berlin by the German military authorities and told that the government urgently needs people who understand the Dutch language, it can be seen that the above rumors may not be completely groundless. (September 18th, Havas dispatch)

Moscow - The Soviet and German governments have jointly issued the following communiqué: "In order to prevent various unfounded rumors regarding the actions of the Soviet and German armies in Poland, the governments of the Soviet Union and Germany hereby declare that the purpose of the armies of the two countries does not violate the interests of the Soviet Union and Germany or conflict with the spirit and letter of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Treaty. On the contrary, the task of the armies of each country is to restore peace and order in Poland, which has been disrupted by the collapse of that country, and to assist the Polish people in rebuilding the conditions for their national existence." (September 18th, TASS dispatch)

### Gandhi Supports Britain's Stance

London - Former Governor of the Northwest Frontier Province of India, Lord Hailey, gave a broadcast speech this evening, stating that India's cooperation with Britain to cope with the European situation is of great significance. The Indian National Congress has never expressed agreement with the goals of German policy. Gandhi, who has always hated war, now believes that Britain's claims are extremely just and that India should provide unconditional assistance. It is still remembered that during the last European war, India voluntarily recruited as many as 1.5 million soldiers, of whom 1.25 million were sent overseas to fight, and supplied Britain with 3.5 million tons of grain. Its loyalty is self-evident. (Right: Gandhi and Nehru) (September 18th, Havas dispatch)

Editorial

### England and France Versus the Soviet Union

Poland's resistance against Germany is as fragile as withered wood. Every battle results in defeat, lasting less than twenty days. The capital is already heavily besieged, and three-quarters of the territory has fallen. England and France are raising their arms to provide assistance. Although significant forces have entered German territory, they remain stalled outside the Siegfried Line. This is how the overall war situation between England, France, and Poland against Germany is viewed. It is merely the beginning, with the ultimate decisive point lying on Germany's western border. However, the war situation on the Polish side has already reached a point where its end is in sight. Then, the Soviet Union forcibly enters, achieving overwhelming victories without bloodshed. As a result, eastern Poland falls entirely under Soviet control, exacerbating Poland's dire situation. Nevertheless, Poland still possesses its government, land, people, army, and political institutions—everything a nation should have. According to military experts, the German Siegfried Line is by no means impregnable. However, it will take at least three months for the Allied forces to complete their preparations for an offensive against the Siegfried Line and launch a major destructive campaign. Three months is not a very long time, but unfortunately, Poland's situation is precarious and cannot last indefinitely. According to yesterday's news, the Polish army has already exhibited signs of complete collapse. The Polish government, from the president to high-ranking officials, and the commanders, from the commander-in-chief to high-ranking generals, have successively fled to the neutral neighboring country of Romania. The land has changed color, and the people do not know where to turn. Therefore, there is no need to talk about three or several months. Even if the Allied forces could flatten the Siegfried Line tomorrow and march grandly towards Berlin, with eastern Poland controlled by the Soviet Union and western Poland becoming Germany's rear end, it would be difficult for Poland to remain a nation. If we were to speak of regrouping and restoring its scale, is that not a distant prospect? It is not a distant prospect, only if the German Nazi regime collapses. If Germany does not collapse, how can it compromise and leave a "crack" for Poland to exist?

Everything stated above is not a curse on Poland. Although Poland is a nation that cannot understand fairness and does not respect justice, and is even willing to align itself with puppets, we still deeply sympathize with its current plight. Everything stated above is also not an acknowledgment of the reality created by force. However, we believe that those who seek to correct reality must, in addition to recognizing reality and encouraging a shared future, as expressed in "Polish President Mościcki's tearful plea to the nation," seek practical and effective paths. But where does that path lie? If England and France persist in their intentions and have the strength to support them, then that is naturally a path to correct reality and a path to Poland's restoration. This goes without saying. If England and France are willing but lack the strength, and another country helps them, that is also a path, which also goes without saying. However, the overall situation has greatly changed. England and France's intentions are what we must consistently uphold. Until the time of this reporter's commentary, we have not heard of any decisions made by England and France. Although England and France claim that the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops into Poland was "not unexpected," they do not have a clear plan on how to deal with it. The hesitation, doubts, and distress of the past few days cannot be concealed. We sincerely do not know what England and France will decide. However, we believe that the principle for any nation in establishing and implementing its policies should be to vigorously pursue its national policy without looking back and not lightly change or reverse its decisions. Only when the overall situation greatly changes is it necessary to reconsider the national policy and then decide whether to change or uphold it. Are England and France currently in the process of deliberation?

What England and France are considering involves many aspects, the resulting consequences are vastly different, and the impact is enormous. Indeed, England and France's declaration of war on Germany has complex arguments, among which fulfilling obligations and assisting Poland is a major argument. Although Poland's current state is in fact on the verge of ceasing to be a nation, it theoretically still exists. To secure the endangered and restore the overthrown are all within the scope of assistance, meaning England and France's obligations still exist. Where there is an obligation, only aggression should be questioned. Why then distinguish between Germany or the Soviet Union? Moreover, if the Soviet Union is left unquestioned, not only will it be impossible to justify oneself in terms of obligations, but if Poland, in some way, appears to have been destroyed by the Soviet Union, what meaning would England and France's continued war against Germany have? Therefore, if England and France do not change their national policy, there is no other path but to declare war on the Soviet Union. As of last night, England and France had not declared war on the Soviet Union. Furthermore, according to dispatches from London, England and France only intend to jointly protest to the Soviet Union and will not take any further action for the time being. Although protesting without declaring war can be said to be a change in national policy, it is also possible to declare war after the protest. However, in the interval between when they should have declared war and when they have not, it can also be said that the national policy is temporarily suspended.

Whether England and France's national policy is suspended or changed, we should not hastily accuse them of being timid or untrustworthy. Why? If England and France declare war on the Soviet Union, it would not only drive the Soviet Union and Germany into closer collusion, as discussed yesterday, but also raise significant questions about how to achieve military victory and whether economic blockade would still be possible. Moreover, it is not just this. England and France's war with Germany allows the war situation to remain relatively simple for a period of time. If England and France and the Soviet Union and Germany become two belligerent groups, then the outcome would be difficult to foresee, and the impact of the outcome would extend to the interests, safety, survival, and demise of all other countries in Europe. Therefore, all countries, whether for their current relationships or for the profound impact in the future, would absolutely be unable to continue maintaining their neutrality. Following England and France's declaration of war on the Soviet Union, all countries would immediately participate in the war one after another. Countries such as Southeast European countries, Baltic countries, and Balkan countries, as well as Italy, Spain, and Portugal, would not be able to stay out of it. With all countries participating in the war, how would the distinction between friends and enemies be made? If they are invited as friends, would their interests not conflict, and what would the conditions be? If they are established as enemies, would the gains not compensate for the losses, and what would the military strategy be? All of these are things that England and France must consider, and they are sufficient to cause England and France to fundamentally change or temporarily suspend their national policy.

War is an extremely cruel and painful behavior that transcends reason. Only when survival is at stake and one is forced to act, as with China, is war sacred. However, even in the midst of continuous war, when enemy forces penetrate deep, when the people are united, and after suffering severe devastation, even while deeply believing that victory is assured, we still hope that Japan will abandon its aggression, withdraw its troops, and make peace. Moreover, if England and France have not yet had major contact with German forces, have not decided to declare war on the Soviet Union, and there is still unlimited potential for expansion to other countries in Europe and even to other continents, at this time, if Germany and the Soviet Union could both restrain their emotions, extend their reason, and mutually renounce some of their ideas and desires, and mutually allow for the free survival of all nations, thus avoiding the most cruel and painful consequences of prolonged war, it is certainly a course of action that reason should strive for in a timely manner. England and France are temporarily suspending their national policy; should Germany and the Soviet Union not also understand the meaning of ultimate misfortune and turn back quickly?

### German Army and Air Force Launch Major Siege; Warsaw's Soldiers and Civilians Refuse to Surrender; Key Polish Military and Political Figures Seek Refuge in Romania; Soldiers Retreat into Neutral Countries and Are Disarmed; Refugees, Supporting the Old and Carrying the Young, Follow One Another on the Road

Paris: The mayor of Warsaw still stated in a broadcast today, without hesitation, that Warsaw would not surrender to German forces. (September 19, Associated Press)
Budapest: According to Polish Colonel Lipinski, who broadcast from Warsaw yesterday, although the Soviet Union has occupied Polish territory, the Soviet Union declared neutrality, so there was indeed no resistance to the Chinese army's advance. He also said that there is fierce fighting around Warsaw, with German infantry using aircraft and heavy artillery as offensive weapons. Although the German side is fiercely bombing Warsaw, the residents of Warsaw are still defending Warsaw with an indomitable spirit. (September 19, Associated Press)

Berlin: German Commander Godon issued a final communiqué stating that the German army's right wing advanced in southern Poland and occupied Drohobych today. Therefore, the most important city in the Polish oil field has fallen into the hands of the German army. No Warsaw envoy has been dispatched yet, so the fighting near Warsaw, which was temporarily suspended, is now continuing. (September 18, Haitong Telegraph)

Lviv: It is learned that the Polish army won a major victory near the city of Grodek (west of Lviv) and annihilated a German motorized unit and a battalion of Austrian infantry. Two German generals were killed in action, and one colonel was captured. (September 18, Havas Telegraph)

Berlin: According to a military expert's report received by the Haitong News Agency, "The German army's plan to encircle the Polish army from the north and south has been completed, opening up a line from East Prussia to the Polish-Hungarian border. Therefore, most of Poland's territory and three-quarters of its people have fallen into the hands of the German army. The area east of this line is mostly inhabited by Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Lithuanians, and has always been a turbulent area. It is pointed out here that the place where the Polish army was stationed two weeks ago was only 150 kilometers away from Berlin. Now, it is 500 kilometers away. Statistics show that the German army has occupied 250,000 square kilometers of land in half a month. Among them, there are some isolated Polish remnants, such as southwest of Vistula, north of Warsaw, near Modlin, and east of Lviv. All have Polish remnants. However, the traffic of these troops has been cut off, and they know nothing about the major political changes in recent days. They are only stubbornly resisting, so clearing them out is only a matter of time." (September 19, Haitong News Agency)

Cernăuți, Romania: Polish Army Commander-in-Chief General Smigly-Rydz, Prime Minister General Składkowski, and General Sosnkowski (former Chief of Staff of former Minister of Military Affairs Piłsudski) have succeeded General Smigly-Rydz in commanding the Polish army. (September 18, Havas)

Rome: Polish Army Commander-in-Chief General Smigly-Rydz has taken refuge in Romania and is now residing in the southern city of Craiova. Polish President Mościcki is temporarily residing in the northern Romanian city of Piatra Neamț. Other members of the Polish government are residing in the central city of Slănic. The Romanian government will allow certain members of the Polish government to reside in the country in a private capacity, but this has not yet been confirmed. (September 18, Havas)

Kaunas, Lithuania: The wife of Polish national hero, the late Minister of Military Affairs General Piłsudski, recently fled into Lithuanian territory with her two daughters. Many Polish dignitaries have also entered the country one after another. (September 18, Havas)

Rome: Yesterday, 350 Polish aircraft arrived in Cernăuți, Romania. Including those that had arrived in Romania earlier, the total has reached 500. The reason why a large number of Polish aircraft flew into Romania is to prevent them from being obtained by the German side. The Polish pilots have been ordered to be detained by the Romanian authorities, and the Polish aircraft have also been temporarily confiscated. Among them, the pilots of four bombers were injured and are now being treated in hospitals. Two aircraft of unknown nationality were scouting on the Romanian border. One of them dropped two bombs on the Romanian village of Cristești, killing six civilians and setting fire to several houses. Another foreign aircraft dropped bombs on Cotlenchin, killing three people and destroying one house. At the same time, Soviet aircraft also bombed the Renadin station in Polish territory outside the border. (September 19, Associated Press)

Rome: A total of 650 Polish aircraft have flown into Romanian territory and have been detained. 550 of them are detained in various places in the north, and 100 are damaged and unusable. There are also 200 tanks and a large amount of military equipment in the capital of Romania, which are also being kept by Romania. According to the Polish consulate in Cernăuți, an estimated 30,000 Polish soldiers and civilians sought refuge in Romania today alone. (September 18, Havas)

London: It is reported that a large number of Polish soldiers and civilians are now crossing into the borders of Latvia and Hungary. At the same time, 60 Polish aircraft landed in the Latvian town of Daugavpils, near the border of Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia. Many of them were damaged as a result of aerial warfare. All Polish soldiers who crossed into Latvia and Hungary have now been disarmed and detained. It is reported that the Hungarian government is willing to take care of the civilians who seek refuge in the country. (September 19, Reuters)

### British Artillery Reinforces French Army; Artillery War Unfolds on Western Front; Villagers on German Border Continue to Evacuate; Troops Transfer Westward in Preparation for Major Battle

Paris: Authoritative military sources announced that as the Allied and German forces prepare for a major battle on the Western Front, British artillery arrived at the front line yesterday to reinforce the French army. The major battle on the Western Front will include attacks on the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line. The silence on the front line was broken by the actions of patrols from both sides in the "no man's land." The two sides exchanged artillery fire to prevent enemy action. At this time, the German army continued to evacuate the people from the villages of Saar, Vosges, Trier, and Aachen. (September 19, Associated Press)

Berlin: Apart from artillery fire, the fighting on the Western Front only involved small teams of outposts operating in the area of Saarlouis. The enemy troops were mostly engaged in digging trenches in various places. There were no air battles in the past two days. (September 19, Haitong Telegraph)

Paris: The General Headquarters has just released its 31st war report stating, "Last night, the enemy troops suddenly launched a counterattack in the eastern part of the Saar region, which was immediately repelled by our troops." Semi-official sources commented that the General Headquarters did not attach much importance to the enemy's counterattack for three reasons: (1) it was very easy for our troops to repel it; (2) this kind of action by the enemy troops was nothing more than a small test of their skills and had no major effect at all; (3) although the positions occupied by our troops in recent days have been constantly bombarded by the enemy, they have been quickly consolidated. In addition, there has been much exaggeration about the fighting on the Western Front. In fact, although the positions occupied by our troops since the start of the war are very extensive, they have not yet taken decisive action. (September 19, Havas Telegraph)

Paris: The Western Front has been quieter in the past 24 hours, with only occasional rifle, machine gun, and artillery fire. It is reported that the German side is now transferring reinforcements and aircraft from the Polish front to strengthen its line and is also evacuating civilians from many villages and destroying their houses. According to the opinion of military observers, the purpose of the German troop evacuation is to allow the German artillery defending the Siegfried Line to exert its power. At present, the shells fired from the German line are constantly exploding in front of the advancing troops. The French side now claims that the German artillery east of Wissembourg in Alsace-Lorraine is quite active and is counterattacking in various places, but it has gradually become quiet. The French army has made considerable progress in the past 15 days, and the German army has also made several decisive counterattacks. It is expected that both sides are now rushing to make the necessary preparations. The latest French war report states that artillery activity is active at all points on the front, especially in the Saarlouis-facing border area. (September 19, Reuters)

### New Italian Appointment; Promoting Bilateral Relations; Will Surely Make Contributions

Rome: The Italian government recently appointed former Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bastianini, as the ambassador to England, succeeding Grandi. (September 19, Haitong Telegraph)

London: After the Italian government appointed Vice-Minister Bastianini as the ambassador to England, well-informed sources here said that this move has special significance under the current circumstances. Since the Italian government could have allowed the affairs of the embassy in England to be handled by an acting official without rushing to appoint a new ambassador, and Bastianini has made many contributions to promoting British-Italian relations in the past few months, this decision to send him to England is indeed the best sign of Italy's attitude. (September 18, Havas Telegraph)

Rome: According to news here today, Italy has decided to maintain neutrality as much as possible until it cannot remain neutral. It is also reported that Japan will continue to maintain a neutral attitude towards the European war. Many newspapers here believe that the Soviet-Japanese armistice agreement has opened the door to Soviet-Japanese cooperation. (September 19, Associated Press)

Rome: Italian political figures recently commented on the joint military action by Germany and the Soviet Union in Poland, saying, "From now on, the order in Eastern Europe will be reorganized based on a new foundation. German newspapers commented on the joint official statement of Germany and the Soviet Union, saying that Germany and the Soviet Union, regardless of the threats from Western countries, jointly used troops against Poland, and their purpose was to determine Poland's fate. There is no doubt about this. Now that the Soviet Union has sent troops to Poland, it will have a decisive influence on the attitude of Southeast European countries. The significance of Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu's visit to Moscow can be seen from this. As for whether the Soviet Union and Turkey will take effective measures to prevent foreign forces from invading the Black Sea so that the war will not expand to the eastern Mediterranean, this is a question that we are paying attention to. In addition, Yugoslavia's sudden expression of willingness to adjust relations with the Soviet Union has aroused the attention of people here." (September 19, Haitong Telegraph)

### Czech People; Deepening Hatred of Germany

Danzig: Today, news received here from France stated that there is a trend of terror in Bohemia, Moravia, and Slovakia. It is reported that a mutiny occurred at the former Czech Skoda armory, and the German secret police captured hundreds of mutineers. The families of those arrested have received warnings not to mourn or mention the execution of those arrested. It is now believed that someone in Brno started an uprising but was suppressed. It is reported that several people were executed. When the Slovak authorities questioned the German secret police, they replied that they had to take all kinds of precautions to prevent actions that were unfavorable to the German army. It is reported that the execution seems to be mostly aimed at the Slovaks, because they advocate cooperation with the Czechs, and this doctrine is obviously becoming increasingly resentful of the Germans.

### European Situation Resembles a Play; England and France Only Have Clown Roles; Cold Sarcasm from U.S. Senator Borah

Washington: Republican Senator Borah told reporters yesterday that the European war was a bit too "comical." The authorities in England and France were only playing "clown" roles and were not making efforts to fight on the Western Front. However, since the Soviet and German armies are still busy fighting on the Eastern Front, according to my personal observation, England and France can take the opportunity to take action. After the Soviet Union joined the war of aggression, the Allied forces may lose the friendship of Turkey. However, if England and France believe that the Soviet Union and Germany are "too powerful to be swallowed," then peace may not be impossible to achieve. (September 19, Associated Press)

Eve of U.S. Congressional Special Session

### White House Calls Leaders of All Factions; To Review European Situation; Whether Neutrality Act Applies to Soviet Union; Depends on Attitude of England and France

Washington: President Roosevelt, in order to thoroughly review the European situation, recently convened leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties for a meeting at the White House on the 20th of this month, asking them to cooperate with the government in the hope that Congress would be able to quickly discuss the amendment to the Neutrality Act when it convenes on the 21st. Those summoned to attend included, on the Republican side, the party's 1936 election candidate Landon and Chicago Daily News publisher Colonel Knox, and on the Democratic side, Senate Majority Leader Barkley, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman, and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom. The government side included Vice President Garner and Secretary of State Hull. It is generally believed that at this time of serious international crisis, Landon and Knox can cooperate with the President as much as possible, as Landon has repeatedly supported the government in the past, and the Chicago Daily News is known for advocating the abolition of the arms embargo. Political figures here said that the "obstructive tactics" adopted by the opposition have had a bad impression domestically. At this time, American public opinion is somewhat disappointed with the chaotic situation in Europe. Although it still has confidence in the government, it has been shaken somewhat by isolationist propaganda. The President's convening of key figures from both parties is intended to prepare before Congress reconvenes so that the current Neutrality Act can be amended smoothly according to the government's wishes. (September 18, Havas News Agency)

Washington: President's Secretary O'Lary said that the President's invitation to various key figures to participate in the group meeting has no partisan significance. Those participating in tomorrow's group meeting will all be "national leaders." (September 19, Associated Press)

According to a statement by an official of the State Department, unless England and France declare war on the Soviet Union, the United States will not impose the Neutrality Act's arms embargo on the Soviet Union. The United States will not take any action regarding the Soviet invasion of Poland until England and France announce their attitude. (September 19, Reuters)

### Polish Envoy Continues to Serve in U.S.; Receives Same Treatment as Czech Envoy

Washington: A State Department official recently made a statement, saying that although the situation in Poland has changed, the country's ambassador to the United States, Potocki, should still be treated as a diplomatic representative. This is no different from the Czech minister to the United States, Hurban, continuing to serve after his country was annexed by Germany. In addition, if Poland forms a temporary government in Paris, the U.S. embassy will also move to Paris. (September 18, Havas News Agency)

### Eastern Newspaper Writes Article: Warning America, If Attitude Towards Japan Does Not Change, The Pacific Will Become a Battlefield

Tokyo - The "Hochi Shimbun," a mouthpiece of the Japanese Army's hardline faction, today issued a warning to the United States, declaring that if the United States does not "change its attitude toward Japan," the Pacific Ocean will become a "battlefield." The newspaper stated that for the past two years, Japan has adopted a "cautious attitude" toward improving Japan-U.S. relations. The newspaper admitted that Japan adopted this policy because the United States is the only major power capable of taking free military action in the Far East, and the United States has supplied Japan with a large amount of essential military supplies for its war against China. The newspaper also said that Japan is trying to avoid antagonizing the United States, because the United States has "no political interest in obstructing the construction of a new order in East Asia." The newspaper continued, "But on the American side, the country is trapped by the concept that 'Japan is an aggressor in the Far East,' and the United States misinterprets all of Japan's actions in the Far East." The newspaper mentioned that during the recent negotiations between the United Kingdom and Japan in Tokyo, the United States "announced the abolition of the 1911 Japan-U.S. Treaty of Commerce and Navigation in order to put pressure on the United Kingdom and Japan." Since the outbreak of the European war, "the United Kingdom has withdrawn from the Far East, while the United States pretends to be the protector of the old order in East Asia." It is reported that the United States is planning other economic measures to oppose Japan, such as banning the export of military supplies to Japan and stopping the purchase of gold. The newspaper also criticized the U.S. fleet for being stationed in the Pacific. The newspaper concluded, "Japan and the United States both do not want war, but Japan may be forced to safeguard its right to survival, which is expected. If the United States insists on a policy of suppressing Japan, and Japan still never changes its doctrine of building a new order in East Asia, then there is a considerable possibility of war between the two countries." The "Asahi Shimbun" and "Yomiuri Shimbun" claimed that the United States intends to succeed the United Kingdom as the "watchdog" of the Far East, and the evidence is obvious. The two newspapers warned the United States against "unnecessary provocations against Japan." "Miyako Shimbun," on the other hand, commented in a different tone, "We hope to restore the Japan-U.S. Treaty of Commerce and Navigation as soon as possible, and to conclude a non-aggression pact with the United States." (U.S. Associated Press dispatch from the 19th)

Yokohama - Suma, former Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in the United States, passed through Yokohama today en route to Changchun to take up his new position at the Japanese Embassy there. According to his words to visiting journalists, the peace and security of the world at present really depend on Japan and the United States. The United States is the leader of the Western Hemisphere, and Japan is the leader of the Far East, so the two countries should work together at this time to seek peace throughout the world. However, the United States has recently been extremely concerned about the situation in Europe. The American people are different from those of 1914, and they all have a real anti-German sentiment. Moreover, because the feelings of Americans are easily impulsive, he believes that it is only a matter of time before the United States joins the European war. As for the relationship between Japan and the United States, he believes that there is no need for a temporary solution, and there will eventually be a day when it will improve. We often point to the United States as being anti-Japanese, but this matter cannot be blamed solely on the United States. If Japan and its people can have a better understanding of Americans, this unfriendly feeling will surely disappear quickly. Therefore, he advocates that Japan should have a deeper understanding of the United States, Suma concluded, that although the U.S. abrogation of the 1911 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is already a thing of the past, Japan came to regard this matter indeed like a bolt from the blue.

### The English Aircraft Carrier Courageous was Sunk by a German Submarine: More Than Half of the Crew of Over a Thousand is Still Missing. English and French Navies Cooperate to Deal with German Submarine Warfare

London - Regarding the British aircraft carrier "Courageous," which was sunk by a German submarine yesterday, the authorities now claim that a total of 681 people have been rescued, including 70 officers. The entire ship carried 1,260 people, so 571 people are still missing. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)

London - After the British aircraft carrier "Courageous" was sunk by a German submarine yesterday, 400 of the rescued crew members have been sent to British ports by destroyers. How many were rescued by merchant ships is still unknown, and the captain, Jones, is also missing. According to a crew member, he last saw the captain standing on the bridge giving the order to abandon ship. Another survivor said that the order to abandon ship was issued five minutes after being hit by a torpedo, and the ship sank within 30 minutes. However, because the ship capsized very quickly, some lifeboats could not be used. Two loud noises were heard in one second, followed by several smaller explosions. When the ship was sinking, some of the crew members were below deck, and most jumped into the sea. Those who could not swim grabbed wooden planks to hold on to. In addition to the destroyers rescuing people, a British merchant ship quickly arrived, presumably rescuing many people, and a Dutch merchant ship and an American cargo ship also came to help. One survivor floated at sea for 75 minutes. According to his account, the crew members acted lively and happily, and sang generously while swimming. Another survivor said that when the "Courageous" was hit, the lights went out, but the crew members were orderly. While they were swimming and waiting to be rescued, they were still joking with each other. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)

Paris - Semi-official sources have recently explained the close cooperation between the British and French navies in dealing with German submarine warfare, stating that as of now, French warships have almost sunk four or five German submarines. This is not an exaggeration. The fact that such results can be achieved in a short period of time is even better than the allied warships in 1918 chasing German submarines with all their might. As for the way in which British and French warships are tasked with destroying submarines, a reserve fleet was formed before the start of the war, ordering them to pursue submarines in wartime, so that the active fleet could concentrate its forces on dealing with the enemy fleet. This reserve fleet is mostly composed of light and fast ships and a large number of armed fishing boats. The torpedoes fired by German submarines are aimed at larger warships, and all pass under the hulls of these ships without hitting them. On the contrary, these armed fishing boats are all equipped with cannons of considerable weight, and there are many submarine-launched cannons, which can be called the nemesis of submarines. (Havas dispatch from the 19th)

London - The Information Department has just released a message stating that one of our planes discovered a German submarine while flying over the sea for reconnaissance at noon today. It immediately dropped several bombs, and after the submarine suffered a violent shock, it immediately sank. In addition, one of our planes, while patrolling the North Sea, encountered three German bombers and was attacked by one of them. It immediately returned fire and then flew safely back to its base. (Havas dispatch from the 18th)

Berlin - According to official sources here, a German submarine has sunk the British fishing boat "Kepler," and all thirteen sailors on board were rescued by the submarine and then released in a lifeboat. (Haitong dispatch from the 19th)

The issue of determining the national border and withdrawing troops will not be negotiated by the local representatives. (Domei dispatch from the 18th)

### American Steel Tycoon Charles M. Schwab Dies: His Success Secret Was Hard Work from Humble Origins

New York - Charles M. Schwab, a famous American millionaire known as the "Steel King," died here today at the age of seventy-seven. Schwab came from humble beginnings. He started out as a seller of cigars at a dime apiece and then worked as a clerk in a grocery store in Braddock, Pennsylvania. One day, Jones, the supervisor of the Edgar Thomson Steel Works established by the Carnegie Brothers Company, came to the store to buy cigars. Schwab had the idea of ​​finding another job, so he asked Jones if he could find a job in the steel factory. Jones said he could, but he had to start by driving piles and dragging chains as an engineer. If you can withstand this labor, you can earn one dollar a day. Schwab immediately replied that he could endure this labor, so he was able to enter the factory. Schwab was unwilling to be a pile driver for long. Every night in his spare time, he studied engineering mathematics diligently and spared no effort. Before long, Jones knew that this young man had potential, so he was appointed assistant engineer in less than six months. Later, within three years, he was promoted to chief engineer and assistant manager of the factory, with a monthly salary of 250 yuan. At that time, he was only twenty-one years old. Schwab's ability to manage affairs won the hearts of the workers. In 1889, after Jones died, Carnegie appointed Schwab to the supervisory position left by Jones. In 1897, he was promoted to general manager of the Carnegie Steel Company. One day, the New York Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet for Schwab. Schwab took the opportunity to suggest the organization of the United States Steel Corporation, saying that if the American steel industry could abandon competition and cooperate, its future would be limitless. In 1901, Wall Street financiers sponsored his proposal, so the United States Steel Corporation was established, and Schwab was appointed general manager. At that time, he was thirty-nine years old. In 1903, Schwab resigned and formed the Bethlehem Steel Corporation himself, and became rich as a result. Today, he is still the chairman of the company. During the last European war, the steel products manufactured by Bethlehem Steel Corporation for the British government were worth 150,000,000 yuan. It also manufactured wartime supplies for Russia, worth 75,000,000 yuan. Germany tried to stop the company's military supplies from being supplied to the Allied countries and offered Schwab 100,000,000 yuan as a bribe not to sell military supplies to the United Kingdom. Schwab refused to accept it. When the United States joined the war, Schwab again built warships, merchant ships, and shells for the U.S. government, working day and night. The scope of its business has expanded day by day. Schwab was optimistic throughout his life and often said that this was the secret to his success. Schwab also said that more money cannot bring happiness. One of the greatest happinesses in life is looking forward to the future, always having something that is just beyond what you will achieve, and always having something that you cannot get. If a person has reached the point where they can buy everything with just writing a check, then their happiness will gradually disappear. I have gained many pleasures in my life that are not caused by money. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)

Based on the consensus of all members, adhering to consistent national policies, and carefully considering current needs, we hereby present several points on the closing day, declared by the Speaker of the Council on behalf of all members to China and abroad: (1) From the beginning of our country's war of resistance against Japan, we have had an absolutely necessary war objective. The battle will not cease until the objective is achieved. The declaration of the first session of this council stated, "China must restore its territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity. This is the minimum position for any country to establish itself and survive. All Chinese nationals pledge to achieve this goal with all sacrifices." "The Chinese nation must mobilize all its material and human resources with a firm and unyielding will for self-defense and humanity, engaging in a long-term war of resistance with the aggressor until the day of final victory." This clarifies the objective of our country's war effort and is recognized by all our soldiers and civilians. For two years, the Japanese have relied on their material strength and military force, vainly attempting to conquer our country and enslave our people. As a result of our strong resistance, all their attempts have failed. China's current combat strength is not only superior to what it was a year ago but also exceeds that at the beginning of the war of resistance two years ago. Many council members have personally visited the front lines or inspected the rear areas, deeply feeling the uplifted morale of the military and the enhanced spirit of the people. Since last winter, progress in all areas has been significant. While we are pleased and grateful, we hope that all our soldiers and working personnel from all walks of life, and the loyal people in all regions, deeply recognize the changes in the enemy's situation. The day of victory in the war of resistance is near. It must be understood that ours is a sacred war of self-defense, while theirs is an army of aggression. We have moral authority, so we become stronger as we fight. They commit acts of aggression, so they become weaker over time. All our soldiers and civilians must grasp this general trend and understand this subtle point. Whether in the north or south, on the front lines or in the guerrilla zones, we must continue to strive and work hard to defeat the enemy. The rear provinces should strengthen the mobilization of human and material resources, which is self-evident. Council members, due to their responsibilities, cannot disclose military secrets or elaborate on strategies. We only hope that our compatriots will remember that China has a definite grasp of final victory, but this requires a long and arduous struggle, unity of purpose, and caution and bravery. This is what we hope for our compatriots to encourage each other. (2) Japan knows that it is impossible to conquer China by force, so it places equal emphasis on political and economic offensives. Their cunning is hateful, and their stupidity is laughable. The Republic of China is an independent country with sacred and inviolable sovereignty. The Chinese nation is an independent nation with a long history and rich cultural thought. These facts are jointly defended by the spirit and blood of the 450 million Chinese people and have been proven by the heroic resistance of all our soldiers and civilians for two years. If the aggressors cannot destroy it by force, they vainly attempt to steal it through cunning schemes? The declaration of the first session of this council stated long ago that the puppet organizations in the north and south, although claiming to be governments, do not have any political power and are only for nominal use. In international law, this is even inferior to the status of a protected country after losing its independence. Furthermore, the sacred and inviolable power of governance has been entrusted to the National Government by the public will of the people. Therefore, betraying the National Government is tantamount to betraying the Chinese nation. This council has already issued a special statement of condemnation. We further hope that all compatriots in the country will always remember the principle that sovereignty is inviolable, embrace the determination that loyalty and treachery cannot coexist, reject all deceptions, and shatter the enemy's delusions with facts. At the same time, we request our government to adopt the resolutions of this council and give advance warning to all countries not to fall for cunning schemes. We firmly believe that world public opinion can unanimously recognize the facts without doubt. (3) The outbreak of the European war is another misfortune for humanity. Tracing the origins of the disaster, Japan's violation of treaties and aggression against China eight years ago today is the root cause. Our country establishes itself on the basis of the Three Principles of the People. Our consistent foreign policy is to respect treaties, uphold good faith, oppose aggression, and love peace. Therefore, we attach great importance to obligations under the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, etc. Unfortunately, since the September 18th Incident, our friendly nations have failed to fully realize the effectiveness of various international covenants to stop Japan's aggression, leading to the increasing expansion of the war of aggression in East Asia. In Europe, the trend of militarism and aggression has also risen greatly under the influence of East Asia. The current outbreak of the European war is greatly influenced by East Asia. The council members, during this meeting, further reviewed the diplomatic situation. All agreed that our country's past policies were very appropriate. Now we wish that all our soldiers and civilians would pay special attention to the fact that interests and right and wrong must ultimately converge. Our country establishes itself on the basis of morality, and the Three Principles of the People are the embodiment of our country's moral essence. Therefore, the principle of nationalism is to seek freedom and equality for China and to respect the freedom and equality of other countries and nations, thereby opposing all wars of aggression and supporting all efforts to establish world peace. This is the public standard of right and wrong for humanity, which is also in our country's best interests. Since the war of resistance, our country has deeply gained the sympathy of the world. The declaration of the first session of this council already expressed its gratitude and comfort. From last winter to the present, the major signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty have mostly declared their firm stand to protect it. Those in the League of Nations meeting who have taken on the responsibility to assist China have also been able to fulfill their promises. Although the European war has broken out, this situation has not changed in the slightest. China should fulfill its obligations as a member of the League of Nations in regards to the European issue. What it especially wishes to take responsibility for is to strengthen the resistance to the conspiracies and atrocities of the aggressor country in East Asia, not only to defeat its plans to invade China but also to block its ambition to manipulate the international situation and oppress all countries. Our military and civilians must know that China's international status and credibility have been continuously enhanced as a result of two years of heroic self-defense, and that China, with a quarter of the world's population, is a major pillar of world peace. The future order, chaos, rise, and fall of East Asia all depend on China as its linchpin. At the same time, we deeply hope that Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union will recognize that the China-Japan issue is the central issue of the world and that Chinese nationals firmly believe that the completion of China's war of resistance and national construction is the most important factor for world peace and progress. No matter how the international situation changes, the ethical responsibility that the Republic of China strives to shoulder will always remain unchanged. This can be announced to the world. (4) Furthermore, we cannot help but say that although the end of the Japanese warlords is approaching, their ambition is not restrained. Coupled with international changes, this further stimulates their desire for speculation. Therefore, if China wants to implement its absolutely necessary war objective, it must mobilize its people and strengthen all facilities for a long-term war of resistance. The Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang had already resolved to convene the National Assembly on a fixed date to implement constitutional government. This was then postponed due to the outbreak of the war of resistance. Now, after two years of war resistance, all the loyal soldiers and civilians of our country support the Three Principles of the People and work hard in the war of resistance. The consolidation of national unity and the solidarity of the people's will have been deeply sympathized with and praised by the world. However, the Japanese warlords are making every effort to attack. We must not allow any complacency. All strengths must be developed, and all shortcomings must be addressed. As a result of careful deliberation, the council members believe that enhancing civil rights and strengthening the foundation of the country should be the most important tasks. Therefore, we dare to resolve to request the government to convene the National Assembly and establish a constitutional framework in accordance with the past resolutions of the Chinese Kuomintang. The council members believe that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are the common belief of our war of resistance and national construction, and the practice of the Three Principles of the People should be urgently formulated into a constitution to be passed on for permanence. Then all nationals who have already experienced the war of resistance today will be the common guarantee for upholding the constitution and practicing the Three Principles of the People. From then on, the foundation of the country will be greatly established, and there will be permanent peace and stability. It is not just to achieve the grand effect of encouraging people's hearts. The council members firmly believe that this session has made the most important contribution with this case. In addition to solemnly proposing to the government, we hope that all compatriots in the country will be more united and determined in their belief in the Three Principles of the People. Each will unite, observe discipline, and do their best to support constitutional government with love, sincerity, and dedication. Secondly, the council members deeply admire the government's attention to the policy of rear area construction. The Sichuan-Kang construction plan resolved at this session is the central issue for promoting the realization of this policy. In short, the focus of future war resistance work is still to strengthen the spiritual and material strength of the war resistance. The day when our military is fully strengthened is the day when the enemy's invasion collapses. The resolutions of this session are all aimed at the only goal of actively strengthening the strength of the war resistance. In addition to hoping that the government will adopt and implement them as much as possible, we must also encourage the unanimous support of all compatriots from all walks of life. Finally, we would like to offer one more word. The council members are familiar with the future and believe that our compatriots must always respect the soldiers who sacrifice themselves for the country, as well as all employees and local compatriots who directly or indirectly dedicate themselves to the arduous work of the war of resistance. All the blood and sweat shed at the front and in the rear over the past two years have obtained the highest price, that is, the facts have already shown that the independence of our country is inviolable and the freedom of the nation is indestructible. Japan has mobilized its entire army but cannot shake our will or destroy our spirit. Counting on nothing else, they continue to use their usual tactics of intimidation and inducement in an attempt to seize by clever means. This is a sign of the enemy's waning strength and exhaustion, and it is also proof that our country has already achieved victory in spirit. All compatriots in the country only need to recognize one key point, that is, today's China is historically unprecedentedly strong. Although it has not yet been able to drive the invaders out of the country immediately, our country's human and material resources are increasing day by day, while the enemy's strength is already declining. All our compatriots, bearing this heavy responsibility, at this time of crisis, their efforts will surely complete the rejuvenation of the nation, and their slackness will lead to becoming slaves of the enemy warlords. Glory or decline, life or death, are worlds apart, and we control it ourselves. Now, on the day of the adjournment of this council, we deeply wish that all compatriots in the country, in addition to deeply understanding the above points and working together, must recognize where the true grasp of our final victory lies and strive for it. Then we will see the day of its success. Not only will the territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity ensure that the country will never again be invaded by foreign enemies, but it will also advance to liberate the Japanese people who blindly follow the militarists in order to establish true peace in East Asia.

### Japanese Army in Guangzhou Massively Arrests Civilians for Three Days, Over a Thousand Detained, City's Financial Situation Extremely Chaotic

Hong Kong Correspondent: Guangzhou's population had slightly increased compared to when it fell into enemy hands, mainly because of the recent foreign exchange contraction, and the devaluation of national and provincial currencies. Those who had previously stored national currency while residing in Hong Kong and Macau were severely affected, because the exchange rate between Hong Kong dollars and national currency was ten to three, meaning ten national dollars could only be exchanged for three Hong Kong dollars (the rate is even lower now, only between 28 to 29%). A middle-class family, if they had stored a thousand national dollars, originally could afford to live abroad for six months, but now they cannot live for three months. In addition, the war in the mainland is endless, and there is no production while living abroad. Those who are slightly aware of worldly affairs are all anxious and recklessly take the risk of returning to the mainland to reduce the burden and consumption of living abroad. Therefore, even before the outbreak of the European war, over ten thousand Cantonese residing in Hong Kong had returned to Guangzhou. After the outbreak of the European war, due to the circumstances in Hong Kong and Macau, and the Hong Kong government's order to evacuate the population, people from Hong Kong continued to return home in droves.

After Cantonese people returned to Guangzhou one after another, the city's market gradually regained some activity. The Japanese army then declared that it would withdraw thirty miles from Guangzhou city in the short term. However, this matter never materialized. At the beginning of this month, on the pretext that there were reports of Chinese troops in plainclothes infiltrating the city, a large number of Japanese troops were suddenly increased from outside the city, and martial law was declared inside and outside the city for three days. Troops were dispatched to encircle and arrest people in the Nantian Cai Lan, Xiguan Longjin Road, and Dongmen Xicun areas, searching houses one by one. Any unfamiliar strong men were arrested. At the same time, Japanese troops were dispatched to the Tenth Fu, Yonghan Road, and Taiping South Road, and directly went to major tea houses, questioning the tea drinkers one by one, and using force to test the tea drinkers' expressions. Those who were slightly suspicious or looked cowardly were arrested regardless of their innocence. It is estimated that after three days of harassment, over a thousand citizens were arrested and suffered inhumane treatment. The checkpoints at various road intersections in the city, which had been removed at one point, have recently been restored, and the treatment of citizens is extremely harsh. Therefore, most of the residents who had returned were disappointed and fled the city again to other places. Consequently, the shops are still nine out of ten empty, and the ironware of the uninhabited households has been dismantled by bandits, and even the beams and timber have been dismantled for firewood. Most of the tall buildings have been reduced to rubble. The Chang Le Street and Eighteenth Fu markets in Xiguan, which used to be prosperous commercial areas, have been reduced to scorched earth after the Japanese army entered the city and set fire for several days. To this day, it is still a desolate scene. The machines of the former provincial-run factories, and the machinery of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau, have all been plundered. The railway steel rails have also been dismantled and transported to the east. Therefore, from the current situation, the essence of Guangzhou, whether public or private, has been exhausted. Looking back on the past, the entire city is nothing more than a desolate and abandoned market.

The city's financial situation is currently extremely chaotic, which is a natural trend. Currency is a thing that exists on faith. If people do not share faith in it, then a thousand gold certificates will become waste paper. The Japanese army, occupying the city, has no love for aliens. In terms of finance, if it can raise funds locally, it will start to exploit and strip them. If it is not easy to obtain, it will issue its military currency indiscriminately. The chaos in the city's finances is like the Qin people viewing the Yue people's fat and lean. Even if the original "Guangdong Provincial banknotes" are completely worthless, this is what the Japanese cannot obtain. Therefore, the ability of Guangzhou's finances to maintain itself depends entirely on whether the existing citizens are able to realize and maintain a common belief. Otherwise, they will dig their own graves, and others will be happy to loot the fire. Who is to blame? It is heard that the Guangzhou Municipal Bank's vouchers are no longer valid (the direct loss to citizens has reached four to five million yuan). As for the provincial bank's small notes, they are inexplicably divided into several types. They are the same paper currency, but those with the signature of a certain person are still circulating, while those with the signature of another person cannot be used. Those that are usable but slightly damaged cannot be used. Such a variety of practices, if the voucher holder is not careful, will suffer losses. As a result, the Japanese military tickets are issued even more, exchanging foreign currency. It is rumored that the Japanese are planning to organize a certain bank in Guangzhou to issue counterfeit banknotes to exchange old tickets. If this happens, the financial and property rights of the entire city will fall into the hands of the Japanese. Social relations have changed little on the surface. British expatriates still go to the "enemy" residences to drink. The emotions of the two sides may be vastly different, but the appearance is quite friendly. The British Consul in Dalian has not yet received instructions from his home government. British ships berthed in Dalian, under the order of the Naval Department, are temporarily not sailing out. Three German ships are also berthed in the port of Dalian, loading soybeans. When Hitler sent his troops to war, two of the ships had already completed loading soybeans and were about to transport them to Japan, but there was a risk of being captured by British warships, so they remained in the port. The German ships' management office is currently negotiating with the Japanese government to have the Japanese navy escort the two ships to Japan. However, according to the general opinion here, this matter is unlikely. It is said that the third German ship stopped loading cargo when the European war broke out. They are all currently berthed in Dalian. Currently, dysentery and typhoid fever are spreading here. Most of those suffering from dysentery are Chinese, about fifteen cases a day, while almost all those suffering from typhoid fever are Japanese, about thirty cases a day, sometimes increasing to as many as forty cases.

### Japanese Army in Shandong Eliminates Puppet Troops, Fang Yongchang Appointed Puppet Daoyin of Southern Shandong, Zhang Buyun and Zhang Zongyuan Fall Out of Favor

Xuzhou Correspondent: The Japanese army entrenched in Shandong Province has now appointed Fang Yongchang as the Daoyin of Southern Shandong and is starting to recruit and appease large and small bandits in various parts of Southern Shandong. However, because the puppet suppression of the Communist Fourth Route Army, led by Zhang Buyun, has a larger force and they are afraid that they will not be easy to command, they recently feigned an inspection and planned to seize their weapons by surprise. Zhang discovered this and led his troops to withdraw to the Songjiatong Xudonggang Jingzhizhen southwest area. It is reported that Zhang's four brigade commanders and chief of staff were detained by the Japanese. Currently, four Japanese troop trains have arrived at the Gaomi station. There are rumors that they will solve both Zhang Zongyuan's and Zhang Buyun's troops at the same time.

### Headquarters of the Shandong-Jiangsu War Zone Strictly Prohibits the Confiscation of Civilian Guns

The Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office of the Shandong-Jiangsu War Zone issued a notice yesterday, roughly stating that during this period of war resistance, it is essential to establish the people's self-defense forces to maintain social order and tranquility. It is reported that recently, some troops have been confiscating civilian guns everywhere under the guise of resisting the war, and arbitrarily labeling people as traitors in order to extort money and kill lives indiscriminately, which is extremely hateful. In the future, no troops may confiscate civilian guns unless approved by the Headquarters of the War Zone. In case of traitor cases, they should be handled by military agencies, troops, or administrative and judicial agencies in accordance with the law to show prudence. If there is any violation, once discovered, it will be severely punished without leniency.

### Recent Situation in Jiangyin

Most Traitors are Subdued

A visitor from Jiangyin said that there are currently about 200 Japanese soldiers in the urban area of Jiangyin, stationed in Weicun Middle School and Beiwai Dong'an in the city. They have outposts at the West City Gate and Xinbei Gate. They also regularly check pedestrians at the Puhui Bridge. The areas along the Chengxi Road, such as Nanzha Qingyangtangtou Bridge, and Nanxiang Qiaoqi Dongxiang Beiguo, all have Japanese troops stationed. They patrol and demonstrate with speedboats. Recently, 100 new soldiers were transported from Japan. They train in the city's stadium every day. Most of them are merchants. Japanese soldiers go to various towns and villages every day to promote propaganda. Every time they arrive, they must first set up machine guns on the streets and alleys to prevent guerrilla attacks, and then send out teams to distribute various propaganda materials. The tone is nothing more than "China and Japan practice friendship," "China and Japan are of the same race," "China cannot become rich and strong without leaving Japan" and other nonsense. He Peixuan, the puppet governor of Jiangyin (ie He Peixuan), is over sixty years old, confused and incompetent. The clerks of the puppet county office's secretarial section, accounting, and other positions are all He's sons and daughters-in-law. They have a total salary of more than two thousand yuan per month. Therefore, the puppet organization of Jiangyin has been contracted by the He family.

More than dozens of Jiangyin traitors have been captured and executed by the Chinese side, including Wu Liyong, Gao Xueqin, Yang Hanqing, Xu Muhan, and Xu Mengjin. As a result, the traitors were shocked and terrified. Recently, many have deeply repented and requested to surrender themselves. The Japanese propaganda team and the military police have become suspicious of these traitors due to the lack of work performance, even suspecting them of colluding with the guerrillas. They are arrested and imprisoned at every turn and forced to confess. A certain special agent captured a traitor named Jin Caiyun outside Junshan Road in the north of the city the other day. It is said that Jin was a former informant for the Japanese propaganda team and was usually trusted by the Japanese.

### Statistics on Japanese Bombing of Zhangzhou

More than Two Hundred Bombs Dropped

Fuzhou Correspondent: Since mid-May, the Japanese air force has bombed Zhangzhou for three months, ten bombing days and twenty-five bombing raids, with the number of bombs dropped exceeding two hundred and fifty, and over two hundred houses of various sizes have been destroyed.

### Puppet Manchu Government Implements Control of Soybean Trade; Dalian Suffers Great Loss from Hurricane

*Zi Lin Bao*, Dalian, September 10th dispatch states: Foreign and Japanese soybean exporters in the Northeast Provinces have long feared that soybean trading would be completely controlled. Now, the "Manchu Government" has finally decided to implement this total control from November 1st. A Soybean Control Company will soon be established, specializing in soybeans and soybean products. Not only soybeans themselves, but also soybean cakes and soybean oil will be controlled. It is expected that a company to control oil extraction will also be established. This move is another monopoly by the "government," making it impossible for private individuals to operate. It seems unlikely that foreign businesses, which have spent decades bringing their commerce to its current prosperous state, will be permitted any scope for activity. This plan is bound to meet with much opposition, as previous discussions of this plan have shown. However, whether it will be beneficial remains to be seen in the future.

Last month, Dalian experienced unusually hot weather, and at the end of the month, it was suddenly hit by a hurricane. Trees were uprooted, and the sea surged violently. The wharf was flooded by seawater to a depth of over three feet. Small boats on the sea were lifted high by the waves and then capsized, some even being thrown into the air for a moment before falling and sinking. Lushun was also hit by the hurricane, and both places suffered heavy losses. It is estimated that the goods stored in the wharves and warehouses suffered at least 5 million Japanese yen in losses. The wind and torrential rain were so fierce that Dalian had not seen anything like it in many years. One of the two major power stations was flooded, and the electricity was cut off. Some parts of Dalian still had water and electricity, but the commercial and entertainment districts were as dark as during the recent air raid drills.

Although there are very few British residents in Dalian within the age limit for active service, they are deeply concerned about Britain's efforts to prevent Germany from re-invading small European countries. After the outbreak of war, the interactions between the British and German residents of Dalian...

### Unprecedented Scene on Nanjing Road: New Record Since the August 13th Battle; Grand Opening of Dachangxiang Silk Store

Dachangxiang Silk Store is organized by major Shanghai merchants. Manager Cao Fengsheng is skilled and resourceful, and has a certain standing in the silk industry. This spring, he took over all the remaining stock of Dachang Xieji Silk Store at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road in front of the market. Soon after, he held a grand clearance sale of the remaining stock at the inventory price, which caused a sensation. After the clearance sale, the store immediately renovated the old facade, turning it into the most beautiful and fashionable modern facade with a three-dimensional design. It is magnificent and unparalleled, and the location is central and convenient for everyone. Therefore, even during the renovation period, ladies from all walks of life were eagerly looking forward to it, and many inquired about the opening date every day. Mr. Cao politely declined, saying that the arrangements were not yet complete, which shows the general attention of society. Because Mr. Cao has frequent interactions with wealthy families in Shanghai, and knows many ladies from prominent families, distinguished customers automatically patronize the store. Moreover, his staff is mostly composed of experienced and knowledgeable people in the silk industry, so he can make a sensation with just one call.

Yesterday was the first day of the grand opening of Dachangxiang Silk Store. At seven o'clock in the morning, the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road was already crowded with people. The traffic was almost cut off. After the unveiling, the crowd surged like a tide. In an instant, the spacious store was filled with people. Fortunately, the store had prepared a large number of staff, so they were able to cope with the excessive crowding calmly. Many ladies were willing to endure hunger and heat in order to get these unexpected bargains, and they all left satisfied.

To commemorate the grand opening, Dachangxiang Silk Store specially offered thousands of sacrificial cheongsam fabrics. Each of these cheongsam fabrics would cost several yuan or more at cost. Now, they are selling for only one yuan, but only those who have obtained a preferential coupon for sacrificial items can purchase them. The acquisition of preferential coupons is very limited, but those who are regular customers of the store or have substantial transactions will naturally have this preferential treatment. If the sales situation yesterday is any indication, the remaining stock of these sacrificial items may be exhausted soon. Those who are quick will get them first. Nanjing Road is the central area of Shanghai, where commerce is concentrated. Since August 13th, there has not been such a grand scene for a long time. Now, Dachangxiang Silk Store has made an amazing move, creating a new record since the war and rapidly taking the lead in the silk industry in this city.

Business of Dachangxiang Silk Store is booming

### Japanese Defense Zone North of the Suzhou Creek Slightly Extended; Extends from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road; No Barbed Wire Set Up in This Area; More Puppet Police in the Shanghai West Extraterritorial Road Area

After the Japanese and puppet military police took action on the extraterritorial roads in Shanghai West, there were rumors that the Japanese military would demand that the British military withdraw from the area north of the Suzhou Creek and be replaced by the Japanese military. This area includes the section from North Jiangxi Road to North Xizang Road. As a result, the people living north of the Suzhou Creek are uneasy. Recently, the goods of various businesses stored in the warehouses of various banks north of the Suzhou Creek have been moved out. Hardware stores, ironmongers, etc., are also moving valuable hardware and iron materials to the south of the Suzhou Creek. The fact that the Japanese military convened a meeting of defense military officials from various countries in Shanghai has further fueled anxiety.

Japanese Defense Zone Slightly Extended

However, yesterday afternoon, it was suddenly reported that the Japanese military would take over the entire area north of the Suzhou Creek tomorrow. In order to find out the truth, the reporter made inquiries with various parties concerned to find out whether the news was indeed true. Reliable information has been obtained, proving that the above rumors are not true. However, it is not without cause. From the 22nd of this month, the Japanese military's defense zone north of the Suzhou Creek will indeed be slightly extended, from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road. This fact has been confirmed. The British troops will withdraw from North Jiangxi Road to the west of North Henan Road at that time.

Extended Area Has No Obstacles

However, it has been agreed by both parties that no obstacles such as barbed wire will be erected in the area extended by the Japanese military. Only the Japanese military will send patrols. Before the August 13th battle, the Huizhong Police Station and the Hongkou Police Station originally used North Henan Road as the boundary. The Hongkou Police Station had jurisdiction up to the east and west steps of North Henan Road. Since Hongkou became a war zone after the war, the Huizhong Police Station took over part of the jurisdiction of the Hongkou Police Station up to North Sichuan Road. Since the Hongkou Police Station restored its original police status, this measure has continued. The decision to change it now is actually to restore the original state.

Huizhong Police Station Reassures Residents

In order to reassure the residents living on the eastern half of North Henan Road, the Huizhong Police Station has sent personnel to inform the residents of the principles and instructed them to live in peace and not be alarmed. Even if the Japanese military comes to investigate, they are instructed to tell the actual situation. If there are any police incidents, they can still call the police station, and the police station will still handle them. According to another message obtained by the reporter, the iron gates connecting the Zhabei border will be opened soon, so that people going to Zhabei will not have to detour. However, whether this statement is true is difficult to prove for the time being and must await future verification. Therefore, residents living north of the Suzhou Creek can rest assured.

Negotiations Between the Two Sides Have Not Yet Yielded Results

Regarding the issue of extraterritorial road construction, the reporter specifically visited a senior official of the British Consulate yesterday. According to him, the Japanese pressure on the Concession authorities has become more active since the outbreak of the European War. Recently, they have again sought to obtain the police power of extraterritorial road construction, threatening to resolve the issue by force and exerting much pressure. In order to ease the situation, the Municipal Council began negotiations with the Japanese puppet regime, but no results have been seen so far. The reporter then asked about the extraterritorial road construction negotiations. It was rumored that a solution could be reached within ten days or half a month, but the official did not give a firm confirmation.

Some Detectives Have Already Been Withdrawn

Although the Municipal Council has denied abandoning police power in the Shanghai West extraterritorial road area on the morning of the 17th, reporters from Da Zhong She went to the area yesterday afternoon for an on-the-spot inspection and saw that the Concession patrolmen on Bailinan Road, Jessfield Road, and Caojiadu had almost completely withdrawn. The task of directing traffic has been taken over by the puppet police. However, Concession patrolmen are still stationed on Xiyuan Road. At the entrances of various alleys, except for Zhongshi New Village and Siming Villa, which are guarded by puppet police, other alleys are still guarded by volunteer police from the police station. This shows that there must be a considerable tacit understanding between the Municipal Council and the Japanese puppet regime. Yesterday, plainclothes agents from the Japanese puppet regime were densely distributed in the extraterritorial road area, and residents and pedestrians were uneasy and warned each other to be careful in their speech. It can be seen that the situation in the area has actually changed.

Number of Puppet Police on Posts Suddenly Increased

There is still only one puppet policeman stationed at the entrances of Zhongshi New Village and Siming Villa on Xiyuan Road. However, the number of puppet policemen in Qianjia Alley, opposite Yuguang Village, suddenly increased to eight. The four puppet policemen stationed in front of the employee dormitory of the Toyota Textile Factory at 1249 Yuyuan Road remained the same yesterday. The puppet police stationed next to the gate of Zhaofeng Park on Bailinan Road were still three yesterday. The two gate patrolmen originally sent by the police station suddenly disappeared yesterday. However, there are still many tourists coming and going to the park. From the intersection of Jessfield Road and Avenue Edward VII, along the way such as Kangjia Bridge, Jinjia Alley, Malu Bridge, Connaught Road, to Caojiadu, there have been puppet police stationed at posts for several days. Yesterday, the number of puppet police at each post suddenly increased. Armed puppet police, led by squad leaders, patrolled back and forth, looking arrogant. The citizens along the street looked at them askance. There were also four puppet police at the entrance of Sanyi Fang, a newly established post.

Security Strengthened in the Concession Border Area

The Lin mansion at 448 Haig Road was occupied by the Japanese puppet regime, and a side door was opened on the east side of the house, with sandbags piled up and posts set up. However, the side door was suddenly sealed off and impassable from the day before yesterday, and people still entered and exited through the main gate. Yesterday, the sandbags next to the side door were also removed, and fortifications were built in front of the main gate, with six or seven armed puppet police stationed there. It is speculated that their intention is to concentrate their forces to guard the main gate. On Haig Road, the armored vehicles of the French Police Station patrolled even more frequently, and a large team of Annamese patrolmen followed the vehicles on foot, searching suspicious pedestrians and vehicles along the way.

Slight Changes in the British Defense Zone

Regarding the adjustment of the defense zones of the troops stationed in various countries, according to a senior official of the British Consulate, speaking to the Da Zhong She reporter, since the commander of the Naval Landing Force, An, convened a meeting of the commanders of the British, American, and Italian troops stationed in Shanghai on the 13th of this month to seek the consent of the commanders of various countries, the countries concerned have proceeded to discuss it. The Japanese side's proposal to adjust the defense zone is based on the fact that it has been two years since the last adjustment, and according to precedent, it should be adjusted again this time. Therefore, various countries have no objection to it. The United Kingdom and the United States have successively expressed their agreement. What is to be discussed today is not whether to adjust, but the content of the specific plan for the adjustment, that is, how to adjust. However, the Japanese side and the British and American sides have not yet put forward a specific plan, so the adjustment of the defense zones of the troops stationed in various countries will not be realized in the short term. At present, the British side has put forward two conditions regarding the Japanese side's desire to take over the British defense zone from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road: (1) The defense zone should not be filled by the Japanese side; (2) Residents should not use passes to enter and exit. The Japanese side has not yet made any indication on this, but it is rumored that the British army will cede the defense zone on the 22nd.

He met with the U.S. Consul-General in Shanghai, Gauss. Outsiders believe that Admiral Hepburn's sudden visit to Shanghai must be related to the defense forces meeting and that Hepburn would provide his opinion. It is now known that Hepburn has already returned north to Qingdao on the original ship at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 19th), but the purpose of his visit to Shanghai has not yet been revealed.

### Ministry of Finance Has Telegraphed Instructions for Issuance of New Auxiliary Currency Notes; Exchange for Corner Notes is Unusually Enthusiastic; Casting Nickel Coins is Not a Fact

The Central Bank issues new notes, whether legal tender corner notes, etc., in accordance with the instructions of the head office. The issue of fractional currency is expected to be done soon as the order from the Ministry of Finance has been received, but the exact date has not been determined. Also, the bank has indeed transported a large number of new notes recently, but the authorities have not allowed the true situation to be revealed. According to inquiries from the bank's issuing department, since the National Army withdrew to the west and the Central Mint stopped working, the bank only continued to issue the two-corner, one-corner, and five-fen nickel coins accumulated over the years for circulation in the market. Later, the head office transported a large number of two-corner and one-corner notes from Hong Kong, which was sufficient to meet the needs of the market, so the issuance of nickel coins was immediately stopped. Recently, various parties have enthusiastically exchanged corner notes for those who lack auxiliary currency, and the daily amount exchanged has exceeded seven or eight tenths of the past. The previous rumor that the bank will continue to cast nickel coins is not true.

### Nationals of Warring Countries Take the Swedish Ship; Not Refused

Shanghai-Ningbo ships come and go in an endless stream; Shanghai-Wenzhou parcels have not been restored. After the outbreak of the European War, in order to maintain neutrality, some shipping companies refused to allow nationals of warring countries to board their ships. However, the reporter learned that the ships operated by the Swedish company Weichang Trading Company in this port, such as the *Beiping*, *Nanjing*, *Ningbo*, *Shandong*, and *Magella*, although may suspend their operations in Europe and Asia due to the impact of the war, the company's ships do not refuse to carry nationals of warring countries. It is said that some of the company's ships will change their routes in Shanghai separately.

The Shanghai-Ningbo transport and Shanghai-Wenzhou routes were once restored last week, but were again obstructed by the Japanese Navy, resulting in another suspension. Freight transport on the Shanghai-Ningbo line has been fairly good recently, so ships have been added to sail repeatedly. The *Haida*, a new ship of the Sino-Italian Company, will make its maiden voyage to Ningbo at 4 p.m. yesterday.

The date of sailing to Ningbo must be determined after it is their turn.

However, due to the obstruction of the Wenzhou voyage again, the Wenzhou personal parcels have not been restored. However, the Shanghai-Fujian parcels have been received.

### Public Concession Lifts Alert; Traffic Resumes

However, the Iron Gate at the Intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Avenue Edouard VII is Not Fully Open

On the anniversary of September 18, the Public Concession Police Department took the necessary precautions, closing unnecessary roads and mobilizing detectives to implement security, but it was not as serious as August 13. The process went very well, so the police's alert was lifted at midnight on that day and restored to its normal state. Bridges over the Suzhou Creek are allowed to pass. Roads connecting the French Concession that were closed have also been opened. Trolleybuses on Route 18 do not need to detour due to the lifting of the alert on the Yu Qiaqing Road Bridge. As for trams on Routes 5, 6, and 7, they are still turning around in front of the Special Second Court because the iron gate at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Avenue Edouard VII has not been fully opened.

### President Kong's Birthday; Celebration Canceled

### Prohibited Import Items; Special Import Permits

Notices Posted by Customs Offices in Various Regions; Jianghai Customs, etc., Have Not Yet Implemented Them

After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods and the List of Imported Goods during the Extraordinary Period, the import of all necessities, in addition to providing foreign exchange, is also subject to a levy of one-fifth of the current import tax rate. The import of prohibited goods, if approved by government agencies due to the regulation of market prices in the rear, the supply of special uses, or other legitimate reasons, may be reviewed by the Ministry.

Based on actual needs, import permits were issued. The measures for the permits have been transferred by the Ministry to the General Taxation Department for compliance by various customs offices. The implementation notices issued by the customs offices are recorded below: "Now, according to the telegraphic order of the Ministry of Finance, the measures for obtaining import permits for prohibited import items during the extraordinary period are formulated in accordance with the provisions of the Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods during the Extraordinary Period. Instructed to

promulgate and implement, etc. Therefore, the gist is hereby promulgated as follows: (1) Import permits are divided into two types: special-purpose permits and commercial sales permits. (2) Customs may allow the import of goods with one of the above two types of permits after collecting taxes in accordance with the current customs regulations.

After verification and release, Customs shall forward the permit to the Ministry of Finance for record. (4) When goods specially permitted for import are transshipped to the interior for distribution through land and water borders, the name and quantity of the goods shall be recorded for inspection along the way. The Shanghai Customs and other customs offices in the occupied areas have not yet implemented the above measures due to the special environment.

### The Tianjin Four Chinese Case: British Assessor's Court Has Not Ruled; the Four Have Already Been Extradited, Nothing Can Be Done; Petitioners May Not Appeal in the Future

The English-language *North China Daily Mail* reports that the British Assessor's Court in China has not yet ruled on the writ of *habeas corpus* regarding the case of the four Chinese terror suspects in Tianjin. The report in the *Morning Post* [another newspaper] this morning [reporting that a ruling had been made] is inaccurate.

*The China Press* reports that Jones, a judge of the British Assessor's Court in China, concluded the sensational case of testing British law last Wednesday, ruling that a writ of *habeas corpus* could not be issued for the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng assassination case in Tianjin to bring them to the British court because the four defendants were not British subjects. It was learned yesterday (the 18th) that the petitioners may not appeal this judgment to a higher British court, as the four defendants have already been handed over to the local Tianjin District Court, and

Jones, a lawyer from the law firm of Ellis & Hayes, who defended the four defendants, has now gone to Japan. Before the verdict, Judge Jones explained the circumstances of issuing the writ to the Tianjin prison authorities regarding the four defendants. It is claimed that the issuance of the writ and the date of issuance are irrelevant to his judgment. The judgment is that a writ of *habeas corpus* cannot be used to bring the four Chinese defendants to the Assessor's Court.

The application of the writ of *habeas corpus* seems to be limited to British subjects and those under British protection, and the person requesting the writ in this case is not one of the two mentioned above. In other words, in his opinion, if the writ of *habeas corpus* were granted for the summons, it would extend the protection of *habeas corpus* law to an unprecedented extent regarding the extradition of the four persons,

it is too late, and nothing can be done. The initial purpose of the writ is to bring the person held in custody to court. Since this is no longer possible, the writ should not be issued. It is noted that when the British Assessor's Court heard the summons on the 11th of this month, Jones, the defender of the four defendants, argued that the British military commander in Tianjin, knowing that the British Assessor's Court judge had sent a summons to him, handed over the suspects to the Japanese puppet court, which was in fact

contempt of court. Judge Jones did not discuss this matter in his judgment, but only pointed out that the British military commander in Tianjin, at the request of the British Consul-General in Tianjin, took the four defendants from the British Concession Police Department on June 7 and was responsible for their detention. Later, at the request of the British Consul-General, the four defendants were handed over to the police department for transportation on September 5. Therefore, when the summons was issued on August 31, the four defendants were

under the custody of the British military commander, but when the summons was delivered on September 6, the four defendants were no longer detained by the British military commander. According to legal circles in this city last night, even if the summons had arrived in time, it would have been found that if a British military officer did not comply with the court summons due to fulfilling a special order from the British government, it could not be called contempt of court.

### Tram Company Issues New Tickets

Advises Passengers Not to Use Them Elsewhere

The Public Concession Tram Company has discovered counterfeiting of the fare tickets issued in June, July, August and March. After announcing a deadline until today (20th), new fare tickets of three types, one, two, and three, have also been issued for use, but the number is small. The company hopes that passengers will not use these fare tickets elsewhere. An urgent notice has been issued as follows: Tram fare tickets can only be used on trams and trolleybuses. Please do not use them elsewhere. If passengers can follow this advice, it will greatly help the ticket sellers' work and make it easier to get change. Passengers are requested to cooperate on this matter. This notice.

### Refugee Relief Association Holds Fundraising Meeting

Yu Qiaqing and over twenty other people attended. Fang Jiaobo presided. From the establishment in November of the 27th year [1938] to the end of August of this year, a total of more than 2,595,000 yuan was received in donations. The results were best in March and April of this year, and slightly inferior in July and August.

### Those Selling Rice at Discounted Prices Should Strictly Maintain Order; An Elderly Person Was Injured in the Third District Yesterday; Discount Sales Were Suspended Twice Before Returning to Normal

The sale of foreign rice at discounted prices, which is entrusted by various groups in this city to the Le Gong Association Rice Shop, was suspended for one day due to "September 18th." [Mukden Incident] Yesterday, it continued. The discounted sales point in the third district (namely, the Jade Buddha Temple on Gordon Road) started selling at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. Civilians buying rice flocked to it, and the number reached more than 5,000 people. Many people rushed to the front, causing the detectives dispatched by the police to be unable to maintain order for a while. An elderly person of more than sixty years old whose name is unknown was injured in the crush. Seeing that the situation was not good, the detectives immediately notified the temporary suspension of the discount sales, rescued the injured person, and sent them to the nearby Labor Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the rice buyers were ordered to line up and enter one after another. At about 9:00 a.m., the sales were resumed, but the discount sales were temporarily suspended again due to the excessive number of people and poor order. Coarse hemp ropes were added to block the area, and the detectives closely monitored the situation. After the sales opened at 11:15 a.m., the order improved. By 12:45 p.m., 200 bags of foreign rice had been sold out, and the sales were announced to be stopped in the afternoon.

Other Districts: Good Order

In addition, 300 bags of rice were distributed in the first district and sold out by 1:00 p.m. Sales were stopped in the afternoon. 200 bags of rice were distributed in the second and fourth districts, and 300 bags of rice were distributed in the fifth district. Sales were stopped at 6:00 p.m. The order was excellent and no incidents occurred. It is heard that the discounted sales will continue today until all 8,000 bags are sold out.

Collecting Rice Tickets: Distributing to the Extremely Poor

A certain female philanthropist witnessed civilians fighting to buy discounted rice, being pushed down, injured, or even killed. She went to the third district yesterday to buy ten rice tickets, worth a total of twenty yuan in national currency, and distributed them to the poorer citizens in the area. When a reporter from the *New Voice* newspaper asked for her name, the lady refused to reveal it.

Bean and Rice Market: Sampling Restored

The Bean and Rice Market Management Committee, in view of the disputes among traders and merchants after the temporary suspension of sampling, has now decided at the 40th resolution meeting to resume sampling immediately. The eighth circular is drafted and issued, stating, "According to the decision of the 45th resolution management committee meeting, the public sampling office will resume sampling immediately. Any disputes for those who have not issued samples will not be accepted. The relevant records are publicly announced for all merchants to take note of." Yesterday, the prices of all goods in the market fell by about one yuan.

Today's Limit: 1,000 Bags to be Sold

It is heard that starting today, the five discounted sales points will each sell 100 bags, with a limit of 1,000 bags. The second discounted sale is also being planned. However, in view of the crowded situation and poor order, the chairman of the association convened a meeting of the heads of each point the day before yesterday and put forward an opinion, which was submitted to the Assistance Association. If the second discounted sale is implemented, it is proposed that each rice shop in the lane and Taoist election section be responsible for selling tickets, so that during the discounted sale, the order, time, and manpower can be further improved. The association has sent one person to each of the five discounted sales points to supervise, so all economic income and expenditure, in addition to the necessary moving funds, plus small numbers such as the placement of paper, etc., are sent to the association. The staff of each point also do their best to fulfill their obligations. The staff of the discounted sales points are all drawn from the rice shops. The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and the store affairs are complicated, so it is convenient for both the public and private to complete the sales as soon as possible. However, the staff of each point serve the civilians all day long without any complaints. On the contrary, they feel comforted. The present Rice Shop Association has remitted 31,000 yuan from the two-day discounted sales to the bank, and the details will be published to the public in the future.

### The Thrift Movement Committee Advises: Do Not Hoard Goods and Speculate; Citizens Should Be Conscientious and Not Seize Excessive Profits; So That Prices Can Return to Normal and Social Harmony Can Be Maintained Together

The Thrift Movement Committee of this city previously stated that due to the tightening of foreign exchange, various industries have raised prices one after another, and even commodities unrelated to foreign exchange have taken the opportunity to increase prices, resulting in a general increase in prices and a serious threat to the livelihood of ordinary people. Therefore, it issued a public announcement, calling on various industries to quickly stop the increase voluntarily, so as not to affect social order. However, since

the outbreak of the European War, general merchants have once again manipulated and speculated, and even people outside the industry have purchased various commodities at high prices, hoarding them in large quantities, attempting to raise prices and sell them, resulting in irregular soaring prices, threatening the livelihood of ordinary people, and the harm is not small. Yesterday, it issued another letter to all sectors, hoping to curb it quickly. The original text reads: "Since the outbreak of the European War, general merchants in Shanghai who deal in foreign goods believe that the time has come, and they have exaggerated their words and fabricated excessive rumors, pretending that the source of certain goods will be cut off, and then manipulated and hoarded the goods that were previously imported at low prices.

Manipulate the hoarding and raise the prices, and most people outside the industry also think of taking the opportunity to make profits. Regardless of the inventory of a certain commodity, how the sales volume is, and whether the source is intermittent or not, they lightly believe in the tricks of speculators and do not hesitate to purchase various goods at higher prices and hoard them in large quantities. The impact has caused the price of foreign goods to tend to rise irregularly, such as Western medicine, pigments, foreign needles, newspapers, etc., the selling price is

The price has risen from morning to evening without end, and compared with before the European War, it has risen by four or five times to more than ten times. As a result, speculators are indeed making several times the profit with the labor of a turnover, but most of the hard-working masses are feeling more and more difficult to live, because the profits of these small tricks are all obtained by exploiting the hard-working masses. As for the general people outside the industry

The result of hoarding goods is not only that there is no profit to be made, but also to give people the opportunity to make profits. According to the results of various investigations, goods from Europe and the United States, and even German goods, can still be transported to Shanghai by neutral countries as usual. As for the white paper, a large number of them have been shipped to Shanghai by Norwegian ships. Since the source of each cargo has not been cut off, the selling price will not rise again. Hoarding and speculating may

On the contrary, it may lead to losses, which are not taken by wise men. It is hoped that merchants from all walks of life will be conscientious. Do not deliberately raise the prices of old stocks and seize excessive profits. People outside the industry should not try to purchase goods and hoard them lightly. It is hoped that the leaders of each dish will guide and earnestly exhort them according to the situation, and jointly curb them, so that prices can return to normal and social harmony can be maintained together. Then thousands of hard-working people will feel great kindness and boundless sincerity. The Shanghai Thrift Movement Committee respectfully informs, hoping to learn and accept."

### Moral Re-Armament Delegation Returned to Shanghai Yesterday

Since Dr. Buchman initiated the Moral Re-Armament movement, it has spread to more than sixty countries in the past twenty years. This summer in July, the movement held its second World Conference in California, USA, with the participation of more than 1,500 delegates from thirty countries. In addition to the twelve Chinese attendees, President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife also sent a telegram of congratulations. After the closing of the conference, some of the Chinese delegates returned to China immediately, while others continued to lecture on the meaning of Moral Re-Armament in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle with delegates from various countries.

### Ji Yunqing Assassinated and Died; Suddenly Attacked by Thugs on the Way Home After Leaving Office; Died of Old Age and Weakness

Yesterday afternoon at 3:50 p.m., a major shooting occurred on South Chengdu Road in the Public Concession. The victim was Ji Yunqing, a well-known figure in Shanghai. Although he was only shot once, he died less than half an hour after being sent to the hospital. Details are recorded below:

Has Lived in Shanghai for Many Years; Already Seventy-Two Years Old

Ji Yunqing was originally from Wuxi and has lived in Shanghai for many years. Although he is seventy-two years old, he is still full of energy. Ji built a large mansion in his original hometown of Wuxi at No. 2 Yuan Road in Xiyi. His Shanghai residence is at No. 2 Jinde Lane, South Chengdu Road. In peacetime, Ji often traveled between Shanghai and Wuxi, but since the outbreak of the war and the fall of Wuxi, Ji has been living in Shanghai all the time.

Got Out of the Car and Was Suddenly Attacked

Yesterday at 3:50 p.m., Ji returned to his residence after bathing at the Xiqingchi Bathhouse on Second Malu. Unexpectedly, just as he stepped out of the lane entrance of Jinde Lane and was getting out of his No. 1051 car, several thugs suddenly jumped out from the roadside and fired several shots at Ji without asking why. Ji was shot in the back of the head and collapsed on the ground. When his family members heard the alarm and came out to look, and the nearby patrolmen arrived, the murderers had already escaped without a trace.

Old Age and Weakness; Died Untreated

At this time, the police station also received a report from the patrolmen on duty in that section and immediately ordered a large number of detectives to rush to investigate and capture the murderers. At the same time, they urgently summoned an ambulance to send Ji to the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. The doctor at the hospital immediately gave him emergency treatment in the operating room, but because Ji was old and weak, he was unable to be saved and died on the spot.

Many Friends; Many Students

His body was sent by the hospital to the coroner's office. After reporting to the court for examination, the body was sent to the World Funeral Home for burial. At the same time, because Ji had many friends and his students were also quite impressive, many people went to visit him after the accident. As for the reason for the murder, it is still under investigation, but according to general rumors, there have been many rumors about Ji recently, and there is some kind of attempt.

Leaves Behind Wife, Children, and Six Grandchildren

Ji's family members include his wife, children, and six grandchildren. His son, Shaoqing, is in his thirties and is married to a woman named Li. They have two sons (Ji's grandsons), named Shuifu and Quanfu. Ji's daughter is married to a man named Dong. Ji's wife, Lu, is also known as Jinbao Shiniang. When the Shanghai Concession Police Department opened a female detective division a few years ago, Jinbao Shiniang was the first to apply and was ranked as the first female detective. Therefore, people in the police force all know her.

### Testimony in the Morris Murder Case; Witness Testifies to the Case; Went to a Brothel Late at Night; Argument Because the Prostitute Was Already Asleep

The *Shanghai Times* reported that Haines, the Recorder of the British Assessor's Court in China, yesterday (the 18th) heard the case of Morris (36 years old, British), a staff member of the Zhoushan Road Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, who was charged with manslaughter. Morris appeared in court to answer the charges. After the testimony of two Chinese eyewitnesses was recorded, the case was adjourned until Thursday morning at 10 a.m. for further hearing. The first eyewitness, Sheng Decun (transliteration), testified that the deceased was his uncle and opened a brothel at No. 688, Lane 74, Baker Road. He was hired by the deceased as a handyman. At 2:30 a.m. on the 9th of this month, he was copying accounts when he suddenly heard a knock on the door while the deceased was mopping the floor in the back room. At this point, Wright, the representative of the Municipal Council, asked the eyewitness if the house was a brothel. The eyewitness answered yes. Then he answered inquiries, saying that there were seven prostitutes in the house. The brothel owner knew that the knocker was a foreigner and refused to open the door first, saying that he heard the person outside the door

singing. After a while, a Chinese man who was traveling with the foreigner said that they were from the Municipal Council and asked him to open the door immediately. The deceased complied. After the Chinese man entered the house, he wanted to call a prostitute. The brothel owner said that the prostitutes were already asleep. The Chinese man insisted on calling one. The deceased finally called one downstairs. Halfway down the stairs, the Chinese man wanted to call several more women. The deceased said that they were all asleep. The Chinese man then slapped the deceased. When the eyewitness testified to this point, he was asked about the appearance of the foreigner. The eyewitness said that one of them was older than

the other one. The Chinese man knocked on the downstairs door, but there was no response. He spoke to the foreigner in a Western language. One of the foreigners grabbed the deceased's coat, he said. At this point, the eyewitness pointed to Morris as the older foreigner who grabbed the deceased's coat. He continued, saying that the foreigner dragged the deceased out the back door, and the Chinese man pushed him from behind. The younger foreigner did not do anything. The deceased was dragged to the lane. The eyewitness ran away to a small shop on Yangshupu Road because Morris said he was going to

return to the house to beat him. He returned after ten minutes and peeked into the lane and saw the foreigner and the Chinese man walking in the direction of Baker Road. When he entered the lane, he saw the brothel owner lying on the ground. He felt him and found that he was dead. The eyewitness quickly chased after the three men and grabbed the younger foreigner. The older foreigner told the eyewitness to go to the Municipal Council. At that time, a Japanese naval patrol team arrived and detained the foreigners and押 (yā)众 (zhòng)人 (rén)返 (fǎn)弄 (nòng)云 (yún), and brought everyone back to the lane, he said. At this point, the defendant's defender, Li Kesi, requested permission

for an adjournment for cross-examination. The testimony of the second eyewitness, Wang Xiuzhen (transliteration), a prostitute in the brothel, was consistent. Li Kesi also requested an adjournment for cross-examination. Recorder Haines adjourned the court and adjourned the case until Thursday morning at 10 a.m. for further hearing.

### Offered to Students Applying to the National Southwestern Associated University (Part 1)

— (Sent from Kunming by Shen Jiaxian)

The unified examination is over, right? Students remaining in Shanghai, if you filled out the National Southwestern Associated University as a preference, here is some reference for you regarding the journey and the school's situation.

The National Southwestern Associated University was reorganized from the Changsha Temporary University, which was formed by the merger of Tsinghua University in Beiping, Peking University, and Nankai University in Tianjin. It is only a little over a year old, but because the reputations of the three schools support it, it has easily grown into a nursery for wartime youth. I believe that on the application forms of the students in Shanghai, three-quarters of them must have written it as their first choice. The National Southwestern Associated University currently has more than 5,000 students. In Kunming, a city less than a quarter the size of Shanghai, you can see their traces everywhere. — If you arrive in Kunming and don't know anyone, you can simply grab a student wearing a khaki uniform and ask them.

The highest authority of the National Southwestern Associated University is the Standing Committee. Previously, the presidents of the three schools, Zhang Boling, Jiang Menglin, and Mei Yiqi, served as standing committee members, deciding on the highest affairs of the school. Underneath, there are four departments: Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, General Affairs, and Registration, headed by Fan Chang, Bao Liangzhao, and Shen Fu Zhai, respectively. Further down, there are many committees — such as life guidance, library design, and scholarships. In terms of academics, there are five colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, Law, Commerce, Engineering, and Teacher Education, with departments such as Chinese Literature, Foreign Languages, Political Science, Economics, Commerce, Physics, Chemistry, Geology and Meteorology, Biology, Law, History and Sociology, Philosophy and Psychology, Education, Civic Education, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Aviation, and Chemical Engineering.

In terms of facilities, there are three libraries. The Departments of Chinese Literature and Foreign Languages each have separate libraries. The College of Science has physics, chemistry, and biology laboratories, as well as a specialized journal reading room. The College of Engineering has carpentry, foundry, forging, and metalworking workshops, as well as laboratories for thermal engineering, AC and DC motors, radio, telephone and telegraph, hydraulics, and material strength. There is also an aircraft model room and a wind tunnel. In addition, Peking University and Tsinghua University have established liberal arts and science research institutes, as well as national conditions survey research institutes, aviation research institutes, and radio research institutes, to prepare graduates for advanced studies.

In terms of faculty, Peking University is famous for its liberal arts and science, Tsinghua for its science and engineering, and Nankai for its law and commerce. After the war, they came together, and no university in the country can surpass them. Therefore, in terms of faculty, it can be called the best in the country. Most of the students are from Hebei Province, followed by Jiangsu. Recently, the number of students from Jiangsu has gradually increased, and it is expected to rank first next semester. There are many small organizations within the school, such as singing groups, drama groups, wall newspapers, student associations, and hometown associations. When you come, you won't have to worry about being lonely and can feel right at home. It is said that the Ministry of Education will release the list of admissions in mid-September. I hope that all the admitted students can come to the mainland, so that we can add a lot of the joy of "meeting an old friend in a foreign land" to our welcoming banquet next semester. The school buildings are scattered in various districts. The Colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, Law, Commerce, and Teacher Education are originally at the Kunhua Agricultural School in the Great West Gate. Because the term is over, they will move into the newly built school buildings next semester. The College of Engineering is on Tuodong Road in the East Gate. The general office and female student dormitory are at the Kunhua Industrial School on Longxiang Street. The male student dormitory is at the Kunhua Normal School and the Kunhua Middle School on Wenlin Street. New students must go through the registration procedures as follows:

(1) Pay fees at the cashier's office (uniform compensation, tuition fee not charged)

(2) Physical examination at the physical education office

(3) Internal organ check at the school infirmary

(4) Receive admission card at the registration office (12 photos required)

(5) Receive room card at the dormitory affairs office (to be continued)

The day's situation remained chaotic, with a difference of $250 between the high and low. Initially, the exchange rate was tight, causing gold prices to rise accordingly. The morning opening reached as high as $4,120. After the opening, the exchange rate suddenly eased, and despite Chongqing's efforts to affirm a peaceful atmosphere, rumors persisted in the market. Coupled with silver shops competing to sell, prices plummeted to $4,030. Later, due to strong absorption by Hong Kong dealers and the securities dealers also stepping in, coupled with a slight softening of the exchange rate, prices rebounded, reaching a peak of $4,140. Subsequently, as the exchange rate tended to ease again, operators such as securities dealers turned from buyers to sellers, falling back to $4,050. At noon, a certain money exchange firm re-entered the market, pulling prices up, closing at $4,080. The afternoon started very stable, once rising to $4,110. Shortly after, news of a significant easing of the exchange rate spread, and rumors intensified, leading to a weak market.

Although a certain gold firm still absorbed some, it was ultimately difficult to counteract, and prices plummeted to a low of $3,890. The result was a closing price of $3,900, a further drop of $100 from the previous day. Before the peaceful atmosphere disappears, a rebound is unlikely. Daily trading remained active, at approximately 3,000 taels. Silver shop gold closed down $15, while customs gold remained unchanged.

At that time, a certain money exchange firm was quite absorbent, rising by $30. A group of securities dealers took in 10 taels from the silver shop for $4,110. Later, the peaceful atmosphere in the market suddenly became more intense, and the exchange rate also reported easing. In addition, many securities dealers closed out their long positions, and silver shops also followed suit, causing the market to decline, plummeting by $70. The silver shop sold 20 taels to the money exchange firm and 40 taels to a certain silver shop, both for $4,040. At that time, money exchange firms mutually traded 10 taels for $4,060. After that, due to the sharp easing of the exchange rate, prices fell another $110. The money exchange firm sold 10 taels to the silver shop for $3,950. At that time, a certain gold firm suddenly came in to absorb, pulling prices up by $30.

Later, the gold firm stopped taking in and watched, and prices fell again, breaking below the $3,900 level. Securities dealers and money exchange firms sold a total of 40 taels to a certain money exchange firm for $3,890. After that, a certain gold firm revived its buying, absorbing more than 100 taels, and the decline stopped.

### Chinese Merchants More Eager to Sell Foreign Exchange, Although the U.S. Exchange Rate Listed Has Shrunk Again, the Process of the Black Market Continues to Show Sharp Easing

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions were affected by the sharp drop of six points in the exchange rate of U.S. dollars against British pounds in overseas exchange, so the Shanghai HSBC U.S. exchange rate listed suddenly shrank by 125, creating an unprecedented tight price of five yuan and a half. The Dutch, French, and Japanese also shrank, while other currencies such as the British exchange rate remained flat. The domestic market opened in the morning, with the U.S. exchange rate tighter than the British exchange rate. The British gold was priced at 4 pence 03125, and the U.S. exchange rate was 6 yuan 375. After the opening, because the peaceful atmosphere of the previous day had not dissipated in the market, most buyers were cautious. In addition, Chinese merchants and Hong Kong telegraphs continued to sell to each other. Although the Japanese Bank and Sassoon absorbed the British gold, the foreign firms' appetite was not good, so the supply was ultimately greater than the demand. At noon, the British gold had hardened to 4 pence 1875, and the U.S. exchange rate had hardened to 6 yuan 6875. In the afternoon, because rumors of the above atmosphere became more intense, all speculators rushed to close out their positions. Chinese banks and Chinese merchants, yarn and flower dealers, etc., competed to sell fiercely, especially British gold. In addition, the amount of foreign firms' intake did not surge, so the situation was extremely relaxed. The cheapest British gold was 4 pence 375, and the U.S. exchange rate also hardened to 6 yuan 9275. The result was a closing price of 4 pence 34375 and 6 yuan 875, for a combined British and U.S. exchange rate of 3 yuan, 7 jiao, 9 fen, 8 li and a half, strong.

After the opening, because the peaceful atmosphere of the previous day was still intense, coupled with the fact that Hong Kong telegraphs and Chinese merchants all competed to sell, and the foreign firms' appetite was not good, the situation returned to tightening.

At the same time, the foreign firms' selling price of the U.S. dollar also returned to 6 yuan and a half. Later, Chinese merchants revived the selling trend, and Hong Kong telegraphs and Hong Kong merchants also sold, so the potential trend became harder again. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegraphs and Chinese merchants successively sold spot British gold to Chinese banks, Youtai, and a certain U.S. bank for 4 pence 15625 and 1875, and spot U.S. exchange rate 6 yuan 615 and 6875.

In the later market, the peaceful atmosphere became more intense, and the general selling positions became more and more prosperous. Chinese banks, overseas Chinese, Shanghai, and Chinese merchants, yarn and flower dealers, etc., all competed to sell, mostly British gold, so the easing trend was more severe in British than in the U.S. It is estimated that Chinese banks and Chinese merchants sold spot British gold to foreign firms from 4 pence 28125 hardening to 375, and sold a small number of spot U.S. dollars to Datong and a certain bank from 6 yuan 6875, rising to 9375.

### Yarn and Flowers, Speculators Uneasy, Yarn Market Declines Rapidly, Double Horse and Heavenly Maiden Each Fall 40 Yuan

The yarn market, which had been rising for a week, suddenly plummeted yesterday, probably because it was rumored that the Sino-Japanese peaceful atmosphere was strong, and the sales were not smooth, the people's hearts were very weak, and the speculators showed an uneasy appearance. A part of them closed out the positions at the market price, and the market quickly declined. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse fell into the 800 yuan level, and Heavenly Maiden broke through the 700 yuan level. Afterwards, merchants with sufficient strength came back to buy cheap goods and take them in, and the price rose again. The Double Horse returned to the edge of 800 yuan. Judging from the current trend, there may be a temporary rotation, waiting for the development of actual needs, and then showing a new posture.

Because the market sentiment was good on the previous day, the morning opening price of the current yarn was 830 yuan for the 20-count Change Horse, which did not move. Double Earth was 780 yuan, a rise of 10 yuan. Shortly after, the sound of selling was revived in the market, and the situation was turbulent.

### New Cotton Arrivals are Increasingly Prosperous, Market Prices Fall Back Four or Five Yuan, Overseas Cotton Markets are also Weak

The trading of current cotton is still not weak, but the market price has slightly fallen back, with a drop of four or five yuan. The overseas cotton market is weak, and the Indian cotton forecast is to fall by more than ten rupees. As the local new cotton is being launched on the market, the source of Tongzhou flowers is unobstructed and is becoming more and more enthusiastic, resulting in softening of the people's hearts and loosening of the selling price. As for the factory, in view of the crowded arrivals, the intention to process has turned淡. The source of northern Jiangsu has about 5,000 bales of Tongzhou flowers arriving, and 480 pieces of Beisha are coming. The current cotton sales prices are listed on the left.

Another message, the Shanghai foreign cotton market, there were various rumors in the market yesterday, so the colleagues were deeply afraid that there would be a major change in the market, so they all planned to temporarily hold a wait-and-see attitude, and the trading suddenly turned quiet. The parties are convinced that this is temporary. Once the verification of this rumor is unfounded, the price of cotton will be able to restore its old view.

Foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, is very quiet, because it is the autumn harvest, and the southern cotton farmers are fiercely selling in the New York cotton market every time the price is high. The sales in the market have been quite intense recently, so the cotton market is difficult to revitalize, and overseas cotton merchants are selling in the market, and the price has fallen by more than ten pounds yesterday. The Indian has dropped thirteen rupees, including the forecast, Egypt has dropped more than twenty pounds, and Liverpool has dropped more than twenty pounds.

The Zhongye Public Institute reported that the stock market was stable and firm yesterday. Although the price was slightly soft when the market opened, the trend gradually moved upward.

Dumai, there is no arrival under the river, wheel buns, and more than 6,000 bags of goods from Lai Kunxing and other districts. Although the arrival of goods is not rare, the people are not willing to easily sell out, so the sales market on this street is ordinary, and the prices of various goods are still standing at the original price, and if the new tip of the river is less, the high one can add half a yuan, and the Wuxi rice is still forty yuan, the high thirty-seven or eight yuan, the middle thirty-six yuan, and the Su Tongkun rice is thirty-six yuan or thirty-five yuan.

### Flour is secretly loose, and the wheat reserve is increasing day by day

The flour market is clearly stable and secretly loose. Although the No. 2 flour factory's market is standing at the original price of seven yuan and two jiao, the return goods have gradually become loose and tired. Because of the sharp drop in the gold market, the sharp drop in rice prices, and the impact of Japanese flour dumping, the people are not weak. Both the North and South passenger sales are rare to open, and they all think about choosing cleverly and taking. Therefore, the market is invisibly loose, and the return goods are looser than before. The price of the warship spleen is seven yuan, a jiao six or seven points, and the price of the fort car brand is only seven yuan and a jiao. The number of transactions is only more than 10,000 bags, and the zero batch transactions on this street are only six or seven thousand bags.

On the 20th, 37,500 bags of flour were exported to Tianjin, 6,130 bags were exported to Xiamen, and 1,750 bags were exported to Hong Kong.

The trend of the wheat market is also fresh to revitalize. The source of various places has been connected in recent days, and the actual sales are flat. The accumulation has become more and more abundant. The holders' intentions have shaken, and they are all willing to sell as the market demands, and the purchasers take this opportunity to suppress the price, causing the market to gradually fall. The two sides of the factory stock are both unable to hold each other, and only the Japanese flour factory has secretly purchased four or five cars, and the price has fallen one or two jiao from before.

### Miscellaneous Grains, New Sesame Continues to Arrive, Selling Prices Rise Two or Three Yuan

### North and South Goods, Pagoda Tree Rice is Stored and Purchased to Revitalize

### Introducing the Business Staff's Price-Controlled Rice Method

— (Cheng Hao)

The Company Allocates 30,000 in Special Reserve as a Fund; The Price-Controlled Rice Method Has Six Aspects for Reference by All Sectors

Recently, prices in "Isolated Island" have soared, especially the price of rice, which has risen to around forty yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), further increasing the hardship of salaried employees. As a result, employees in various industries have requested subsidies and relief from their employers. There are not a few employers who are able to sympathize with the lives of their employees and implement the issuance of subsidies. However, some issue rice subsidies, while others increase salaries by a few percent, ranging from several yuan to several tens of yuan, with varying amounts and many advantages and disadvantages to the methods.

Last month, the business staff raised a request for rice subsidies with the management. After many twists and turns, the management recently decided on a method for price-controlled rice sales to employees, which will be implemented from September. The details are introduced as follows:

(1) The company will allocate 30,000 yuan from the "Type B Special Reserve" fund (originally for public welfare) as a fund for price-controlled rice sales to all colleagues in Shanghai. When this fund is depleted to the point where it is insufficient to price-control an adequate amount of rice, the company will consider adding more funds.

(2) All colleagues in Shanghai with a monthly salary of less than 100 yuan are eligible to enjoy the benefits of price-controlled rice sales.

(3) Those who enjoy the benefits of price-controlled rice sales are limited to a maximum of 80 jin (unit of weight) per month, and are graded according to their needs as follows: (A) Student female workers (widowed female workers who have parents-in-law and children to support will be treated the same as male workers) and male workers who are alone in Shanghai will each be able to purchase 20 jin of price-controlled rice per month (equivalent to one dou (unit of dry measure) and two and a half sheng (unit of dry measure)). (B) Male workers whose wives, children, or dependent direct ascendants live with them in Shanghai will be able to purchase 40 jin of price-controlled rice per month; those with two people living with them in Shanghai will be able to purchase 50 jin; those with three people living with them in Shanghai will be able to purchase 60 jin; those with four people living with them in Shanghai will be able to purchase 70 jin; those with five people living with them in Shanghai (if there are more than two children or dependent direct ascendants, they will still be counted as two people) will be able to purchase 80 jin (equivalent to five dou).

(4) The price-controlled price will be 15 yuan per shi when the rice price is within 40 yuan. If the rice price exceeds 40 yuan, the price sold to colleagues will be the sum of the excess and 15 yuan. For example, if the rice price is 41 yuan per shi, the price sold to colleagues should be calculated at 16 yuan per shi. When the rice price falls back to below 15 yuan, the price-controlled method will be cancelled.

(5) The average market price of No. 2 Japonica rice from the 1st to the 10th of each month will be used as the standard, but if the average exceeds 40 yuan, it will still be calculated as 40 yuan.

(6) The company will calculate the amount of rice subsidized by the company based on the amount of rice that each level of colleagues can purchase as stipulated in Article 3, and then calculate the subsidized rice price according to the standard in Article 5. This will be noted on the "Price-Controlled Rice Coupon," which will be distributed on the 15th of each month. Colleagues can use this coupon to purchase rice at the calculated rice price from the rice shop designated by the company. After receiving the coupon, the rice shop can send a letter to the company to collect the money.

Although this price-controlled method does not completely alleviate the difficulties of our employees' lives, it is still a relatively fair and reasonable rice subsidy method, so I am introducing it based on the facts, so that the authorities of various industries can use it as a reference for improving the lives of their employees.

### The Voice of Women

— Shen Shiguang

It was on September 10th that I saw a notice on the newspaper that said "The Postal Administration is Recruiting Junior Postal Workers on Behalf of the Mainland." At that time, I was so happy that I jumped up, because according to the usual rules, postal workers were recruited from women. Now that I meet all the requirements, and going to the mainland has always been my wish, isn't this a great opportunity? So, the next morning, I ran from Zhaofeng Garden in the far west to the General Post Office on North Sichuan Road in the far north, with a heart full of enthusiasm and hope, and stepped onto the business department on the second floor. I stopped at window number ten:

"Sir, please give me an application form."

"Ha! The General Office just called and said that we are not accepting female employees this time."

This ban made me come with a heart full of enthusiasm, but return with a shattered heart. I don't know if I should be angry or sad at that time. Because of the economy, I couldn't go to university; it is difficult to find a job in Shanghai, and going to the mainland requires slowly waiting for an opportunity. Now I thought the best opportunity had come, but who knew that this only hope would be shattered without a trace? This sadness is truly unbearable!

I heard that the reason for not accepting women is because "women are physically weak and cannot endure the pain of traveling far." This kind of consideration is somewhat pedantic. Are girls born in the 20th century still so weak? I dare to apply, don't I know my own physical condition? Of course, most modern ladies are unwilling to go to the mainland to suffer, but for women like us who are willing to serve in the mainland, I am confident that my body is not much worse than that of a man! If you compare the women of the Northwest with the young masters of Shanghai, I think the latter would truly be ashamed of themselves, right? I hope that everyone will not only keep the old mentality. The giant wheel of the times is moving forward, and humanity is also evolving. Women are not always and forever boudoir ladies who cannot travel far! I hope the authorities can think twice before acting.

In this era of the 20th century, when gender equality and women's economic independence are being sung to the clouds, women are still being rejected everywhere they go to find employment. I don't know what this means? Married women are already rejected, and unmarried women are also facing misfortune. I really don't know if women should always and forever die.

Men often ridicule women for not being able to be economically independent, but looking at the current situation, is it that we are voluntarily not independent, or is it caused by the social environment?

Finally, I want to tell everyone that the number of men and women who are continuing to go to the mainland to study is almost equal. Please don't think that the women's department cannot endure the pain of traveling far.

Finally, I hope that my female compatriots will all exert their strength to strive for our rights and our careers!

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 16: Planning to Establish Medical Education and Talent Cultivation, Thinking About Expanding Rural Governance and Providing Care for Children

In addition, the imperfections in sanitation are all too visible, and it is difficult to describe them all. Old Doctor Zhang asked around in various places, and she only chose remote places to see, and felt that the people in some places were really suffering. But now they are gradually thinking about improving, if it were in the past, it would be like hell. However, improving sanitation and everything else requires considerable talent. Before the war, China was confused and did not know how to cultivate talent. Also, because talent could not be matched with the cause, there was often very good talent that could not be used by the world. Even to the point where many people, for the sake of living, had to use what they had not learned and had to change careers. Now, with normal careers matched with proper talent, one feels a lack. Old Doctor Zhang thought that in order to develop the sanitation cause in the mainland, one must quickly cultivate sanitation talent. She used to be like the isolationists in the United States, only guarding her own post, and not asking about anything else. What was her own post? It was running this Women and Children's Hospital well. At that time, the Women and Children's Hospital was very small, and even had no nursery. Even Chang'er, who sent Zhu Airen to study in the United States, was still guarding her post. She wanted to run the obstetrics and pediatrics departments well, and the starting point was still in medicine. But later, the nursery was run very smoothly, and it was famous at home and abroad. And there was that story of triplets, a rare anecdote that aroused people's interest. Donations were automatically sent by people, which exceeded the scope of just obstetrics and pediatrics medicine, and made the people who ran it even more interested. But because this place's reputation rose, many people asked Old Doctor Zhang for talent. Not only their church, but also those who preached in the mainland, ran charities, and established hospitals, asked her for talent. Even the Health Committee established by the government asked her for talent. Therefore, Old Doctor Zhang's post, which she had always stood on, expanded a little, and she also wanted to cultivate more talent. Since she went to the Chinese mainland for a tour, she felt even more that there was a lack of talent everywhere, and that there was a need for talent, and that more talent had to be cultivated. How to cultivate talent? It was necessary to establish a medical school. With China's place as big as it is, and the people as numerous as they are, establishing a medical school is like a drop in the bucket, it is useless. However, having one more medical school is always better than cultivating some talent, and cultivating some talent to respond to the requests from all parties is also good. Because medical schools often need a place for practice, and this place has a Women and Children's Hospital that can be used for practice after all. Old Doctor Zhang has had this wish for more than a year since she traveled in the Chinese mainland. (183)

### Special Feature on a Certain Foreign Firm

— Xing

A Miniature of the Shanghai Foreign Goods Market

It was Saturday morning, just at half past eight, and the comprador's room of a certain foreign firm was already very lively. A mixture of conversations and a strong smell of cigarettes filled this quiet comprador's room.

The sound of the bell, Dangdang..., broke the tense atmosphere, and unceremoniously rang nine times in a row.

"Why hasn't the comprador Mr. arrived yet? Yesterday he promised to sell me thirty pieces of kraft paper, the selling price was set at six jiao (unit of currency) per pound in silver dollars, but according to last night's buying price, it has already risen to seven jiao per pound. If he doesn't come in a while, I'm afraid he will overturn the previous agreement!" Mr. Wang, who was sitting alone in the west corner, seemed a little disappointed as he waited.

"Isn't that right? The day before yesterday morning, I bought five hundred reams of newsprint from him, the price was set at seventeen yuan and five jiao per ream, but when I sent the money to pick up the goods in the afternoon, the market price had already risen to nineteen yuan per ream. Therefore, the transaction was almost broken. Fortunately, Mr. Zhao was willing to mediate, and the transaction was completed at a price of eighteen yuan per ream. It is really difficult to buy popular goods now, you are fighting and snatching, and the selling price in the market is different in the morning and evening. There is a risk of price changes in the blink of an eye, how can we be separated by this long night, I am afraid that the agreed price has become nonsense!" Mr. Li continued Mr. Wang's conversation.

"I heard that the foreign fixed price has also risen by 20%, and the goods cannot be delivered for the time being in the next two or three months, so the negotiated price in the guild yesterday was also extremely chaotic because of this. The five pieces of lightweight kraft paper that Xiao Lu received the day before yesterday were sold yesterday afternoon, earning more than 300 yuan. It is said that Mr. Mao alone hoarded more than 50,000 yuan of newsprint a month ago. According to yesterday's market price, he has already made more than 70,000 yuan in unexpected gains. Who wouldn't be jealous of that? So I also came to collect as much as possible. As long as there is an opportunity, all the expenses for the second half of this year can be covered by this "beginning"!" A Wu said excitedly.

"The comprador Mr. is here!" Just this light sentence interrupted their conversation, and in an instant it was completely silent.

A fat comprador Mr. had just stepped into the door of the comprador's room, and had already been surrounded by many buyers. What followed was the negotiation of prices, looking at samples, and doing the necessary procedures for buying and selling.

Although the selling price is constantly rising, there are still many buyers who will try their best to collect as much as possible. As long as there are stocks for sale, the buyers will not have the slightest complaint about the selling price being slightly more expensive. Because they all have a mysterious hope, how to rely on this stock to make a big profit!

Therefore, in a small writing room like a bucket, they are just busy punching stacks, issuing invoices, collecting money, resolving banks, and settling drafts, and they are busy together.

The clock is constantly moving forward, and the buyers in the comprador's room are also changing in batches. Some are hoarding in large quantities, and some are buying in small numbers. The chaotic situation in these three hours is also a miniature of the Shanghai foreign goods market.

### Can the Script Be Ignored in Acting?

— Zhang Guyu

Drama is social education. To teach students, one must examine and approve the textbook. To persuade the masses, can the script be ignored? In the middle of the Qing Dynasty, the people's spirit was strong, and the people's hearts were simple and straightforward. Everything was valued for its righteousness, and prejudice was considered despicable. Watching dramas was all about thinking from the positive side. It was not as decadent as the people's spirit is today, and the people's hearts are treacherous and cunning, abandoning the right path and not following it. Therefore, Hong Ni Guan and Battle of Wancheng were considered plays that advised women not to have delusional thoughts in the early years. Today, people do not pay attention to the result, but instead focus on thinking about spring. Persuading good has become teaching lewdness. Playing the Dragon Robe and Touring the Six Halls were thought by the ancients to be able to encourage filial piety, but today people see them as promoting superstition. Seeing Ma Yi in The Ninth Watch and Yue Fei in The Pavilion of the Windy Waves, old people mostly respect their loyalty, and at the same time think of the abominable and hateful nature of Hou Huazui and Zhang Bangchang. Today, people not only do not think of the poisonous treachery of Hou and Zhang, but instead say that Ma is forbearing and Yue is stupid. On the surface, the Seven Star Temple seems to be unremarkable, but in fact it is secretly warning young men and women not to engage in illicit stories in the outside world. It is said that the Yang family had no results later, which was the retribution for the illicit affairs in the Seven Star Temple. Today, most young men and women hold the concept of enjoying the moment. The word "future" seems to be unnecessary to talk about.

The Scholar's Handbook writes about Chen Zhi's loveliness on the one hand and Zhu Cang's abominableness on the other. From this, it is telling us that the ancients were so poor that they became beggars, but they still did not forget their ancestors. Taking Gao Deng is to state that the son of a treacherous official fishes and meats the people, and in the end he is killed by others. It can also make people today know that the ancients were willing to help the righteous and save the endangered. Going to Tiantai Mountain is to record the monarch's indulgence in female lust and his failure to handle important matters. Luanzhou writes about a military general who died loyally and was respected by the enemy instead. Why did the Shepherd's Scroll have Xi Peng recognize his wife? And why did it write about Xi Peng recognizing his mother? Because Zhu's mother did not die, it was due to the merit of his daughter-in-law, Zhao. Not recognizing his mother but rewriting recognizing his wife is to encourage future generations. The White Silk Record is a warning to students not to set foot in flower bushes. Picking the Slide Car is an implication that young people should never act too hastily. And so on and so forth. It is a pity that the actors today only seek to meet the welcome of the audience, and the audience only wants the actors to give them good looks and good sounds. Acting and watching plays are just like that. Who cares about the responsibility? Who explores the meaning? People's hearts and customs are different from the past. How can the plays performed be based on previous examples?

Choosing a script is the most important issue at present. Plays that teach lewdness and theft should be fundamentally prohibited. Plays that are mediocre and do not conform to the trend should also be banned. In short, all the plays performed are conscious, purposeful, and suitable for the trend and environment. The performers perform in the same way, and the audience is unconsciously influenced. Then, singing plays is not without purpose, and watching plays is beneficial.

### Random Memories of Chrysanthemums (Part 2)

— Xiao Cang

Before the tenth year of the Republic of China, there was a female actress named He Shunqin in the old capital. She had sung on the same stage with Li Guifen, Fu Zhifang, Shuang Lanying, and others. At that time, Shunqin's magic power was quite strong. Shunqin was originally a famous prostitute in the capital. Her posture was extremely beautiful. When she dressed up and went on stage, her style was excellent. The beauty of her entire body was all in her eyes. Ordinary people were all fascinated by her. She liked to make friends with martial arts students. She had relationships with Yang Xiaolou, Shen Huaxuan, Yu Zhenting, Jiuzhenfeng, Zhou Ruian, Liu Yanfang, and others. Xiaolou and Yanfang were like father-in-law and son-in-law, and Shunqin was able to combine the two, which was also an interesting story in the Peking opera world. Shunqin usually entered the various theaters in colorful makeup. When the martial arts students came on stage, she would stare intently, and her licentious intentions were all in her eyebrows. Even though thousands of people were watching, she did not care at all. When the song ended, she would suddenly disappear. Whenever a new martial arts student arrived, she would definitely strive to get acquainted first. The drunkard's intention was not really about the wine. In a certain year, Gai Jiaotian went north to perform, and Shunqin saw that his skills were strong and healthy, and liked him. She pursued him by all means, and finally entered the snare. Shunqin rented a small house on Cherry Diagonal Street, and lived with him for several months, inseparable, as if they were a loving couple. It happened that Gai's father met Chen Leqing, a prostitute in the north. Chen was a famous prostitute, and Shunqin fought with her, leading to a break. Shunqin then hunted Zhou Ruian to soothe her loneliness. Yang Xiaolou also had a vinegar wave with Yanfang because of Shunqin. After mediation by insiders, the two of them would meet in boots—meeting in boots meant that two people would go to the same prostitute, and meet in her boudoir. The two people's private suspicion was released. There was also one thing that was really ridiculous. Shunqin and a certain martial arts student (some said Kang Xishou, some said Shen Huaxuan) were traveling in the New World of the old capital. The two of them suddenly engaged in obscene acts in a telephone booth. The matter was reported by tourists, and the police rushed to arrest the two of them and take them to the official office. They were fined and detained for several days before the matter was settled. Her scandalous secrets were mostly like this. In the autumn of the eighth year of the Republic of China, I once listened to her singing the song "Relieving Jade Hall Spring" with Mr. Hu Pingzhai in Zhonghe Garden. Hu listened to Shunqin's songs for several days, and his intention was also to hunt Shunqin and want to get her to be satisfied. She was not bad in both singing and body movements, and her color was even more moving, but her white mouth expressions were not as good as those of insiders. Later, a certain Cantonese official loved her, and booked a seat and supported her every day. After the play, they would ride in a car together and leave, and passers-by would watch them off. Those who supported her would all shout good, and their ugly attitude was completely exposed. After the tenth year of the Republic of China, she disappeared from the singing stage.

The Story of Wang Keqin's Separation and Reunion with Zhang Xun

One day, my late friend Lin Wushan and I went to Tian Taishan Nong's book selling place on Beile Road in the French Concession. That day was the birthday of his female disciple, Ms. Keqin. At that time, very exquisite delicacies were prepared, all made by the female soil. Another couch was set up, with a small jar of high-quality opium placed on it. After the meal, Keqin also burned cigarettes for Wu Changshuo and Shannong. Her skills were extremely exquisite. The lady's conversation was elegant and interesting. In her words, she deeply hated Zhang's vulgarity and immorality. She said, "One day, when it was very hot, Zhang's first wife kept shouting that she was thirsty. There was no place to get a melon at night. Zhang was at that time naked, with bare arms and feet. He secretly put the old skin on his feet and the greasy ash on his arms into the pot, and said to his first wife, 'This is a famous mountain scented tea specially given by a certain governor. Drink a cup, and I guarantee you won't shout that you're thirsty again.' The first wife just drank a cup, and Zhang immediately clapped his hands and laughed, running around and almost falling to the ground. The first wife knew that there was nothing good, and quickly chased after him, asking what he had put in it. When he explained, the first wife immediately vomited and chased after him, cursing, 'What a old fart, you old boy, you really hurt me.' Zhang laughed even more when he heard this, tears streaming down his face. It is estimated that Old Zhang did a lot of this kind of prank, but except for the first wife, we all didn't curse him. Even if sometimes he couldn't help but scold me for fun, I would always put on a serious face and ignore him, and later he would just let it go. Otherwise, he would act unreasonably and be shameless and refuse to pay, so those adjutants and commanders under him always called him Win to please him and make him happy. (104)

Random Notes on Artists

### Young Musician Chen Gexin (Part 2)

— Tianma

— Answering Questions from Guests for Entering the New Capital

Yesterday, the reporter visited Chen Jun and listened to his classical music. By the way, he asked him about his thoughts after entering "Xindu". His answer was:

It is already a great fortune for art if those who do not respect art can avoid forcefully destroying it. The "Xindu" authorities quite want to innovate the "vulgarization" of broadcasting programs. I introduced some works with artistic value, and I cooperated with "Xindu" in this way.

In terms of content, we have instrumental music, vocal music, and dance. Most of the instrumental music is an introduction to simple and popular Western works. Vocal music and dance are mostly some translated songs of domestic works. Nineteen of the dances are sketches. If the equipment is advanced, the promotion of "New Songs and Dances" can be very smooth.

Those who have become degenerate and prostituted have complained: "Chen Gexin is getting more and more degenerate with songs and dances." I will not pay attention to this kind of malicious attack. I will only introduce new songs and dances to the public and never collude with others.

In short, he is a person who claims to protect Classic Msnic "classical" music, and his performance at the Xindu Hotel is "classical" music, because he is a "classical supreme" young musician.

### Bai Yang Recovers from Illness

— Hui

(Chongqing Correspondence) Bai Yang and Gao Zhanfei, who live in Xindu, could not help but be moved when they received the two thousand yuan travel expenses remitted by the Xinhua Company in Shanghai, and planned to set off for Shanghai immediately. However, later, because of the direct dissuasion from local friends and the ridicule behind their backs, their trip to Shanghai was temporarily suspended.

When they were still hesitating about returning to Shanghai, Bai Yang suddenly fell ill due to excessive physical exhaustion and excessive losses from previous illegal production. Fortunately, he stayed at Renji Hospital on the South Bank. After more than two weeks of recuperation, he finally recovered from his illness. Now he has fully recovered to health.

Just after Bai Yang recovered from his illness, the "China Electric" authorities started filming again because a large number of negatives had been transported. Bai Yang only has a "Long Sky Ten Thousand Miles" co-starring with Gao Zhanfei, besides the filming of "Children of China".

The film has been going on for more than a year since it started last year. Most of it has been completed, and there is still a small part of the location. The work has been repeatedly suspended and delayed due to air raids and film problems. It was not until recently that it continued to be filmed.

On the 7th of this month, the director of the film, Sun Yu, specially borrowed several pieces of air combat equipment from the Mechanical Department of ×× Department, and immediately took all the staff to Chengdu to shoot the location. It is decided that Gao and Bai will live together in the Sullivan Hotel in Chengdu. It is said that after filming the location in Chengdu, they will also go to Kunming to take the location.

Judging from this situation, their current work is becoming more and more tense. The so-called return to Shanghai, even if it is realized, will have to be after the film is finished, and it is estimated that the completion date of the film will still be several months later!

Corrections: Yesterday's photo caption The thief of Bagdad was completely inverted, and the title of the first article "Call for" of the "Call for" was mistaken as a call, and should be corrected immediately.

Declaration: The article "Ren Guanghe and An'e" by An Lan published in this journal on the 17th was found to be plagiarized, and the manuscript fee should be cancelled.
