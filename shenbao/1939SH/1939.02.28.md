### Guangdong Provincial Chinese Army Strengthens Forces, Prepares to Attack Jing Army Joint Corps; Southern Guangdong Chinese Defenses Transformed After Deployment; Chinese Aircraft Bomb Japanese Ship Outside Haikou Port, One Hit; Hainan Island Chinese Army Communicates as Usual Under Wang Yi's Command

(Hong Kong) After the military leaders of Guilin arrived in southern Guangdong to deploy defenses, the southern route has been strengthened with troops, and the situation has taken on a new look. General observation suggests that the Japanese army is temporarily unable to invade southern Guangdong, and the talk of attacking Guilin is even further from the truth. The military authorities of the northeast routes, due to the continuous Japanese reinforcements to the East River in recent weeks, have strengthened their forces to prevent the Japanese army from large-scale incursions and are preparing to encircle and attack the Japanese. The Chief of Staff of the Southwest Headquarters stated yesterday that the Japanese army landing on Hainan Island can only control the coastal areas. To date, those occupied are only Haikou, Qiongshan, Chengmai, Wenchang, Ding'an, and Yulin Port. The vast majority of the rest is still in the hands of the Chinese army, which is under the full command of Wang Yi, and communication with the rear is as usual. It will certainly be able to hold out against the Japanese army for a long time. (Special dispatch at 9 p.m. on the 27th)

Editorial

### After Britain and France Recognize the National Army Government of Spain

When Eden visited the United States last year, President Roosevelt hinted to him that Britain must not recognize the rebel government of Spain. President Roosevelt's reasoning was very clear: because the Spanish National Army under the command of the Italian and German fascists was merely a puppet, recognizing the National Army government was tantamount to legalizing fascist aggression. Democratic countries could not actively help the government army, but at least they should strictly adhere to the "non-recognition doctrine" towards the aggressors. However, Chamberlain and Daladier clearly refused to understand President Roosevelt's hint and finally, at a time when the Spanish resistance was entering a critical juncture, openly decided to recognize the Spanish National Army government as the legitimate government. Recognizing the National Army government is tantamount to not recognizing the existence of the legitimate government elected by the Spanish people. Today, when peace-loving people in Britain, France, and even the world are shouting "Aid the Spanish Republic," the actions of the British and French governments in encouraging aggression are truly the opposite of international justice and a betrayal of the majority of the people at home.

Moreover, the unjust behavior of Britain and France in recognizing the Spanish National Army government this time not only violates the principles of democracy, but is also incomprehensible from the perspective of their own interests. Everyone knows that the Mediterranean is Britain's lifeline, and Gibraltar is especially the gateway to the eastern Mediterranean. If Mussolini's puppet Franco controlled Spain, then they could cut off Gibraltar's communications from Spanish ports such as Cadiz, Ceuta, Melilla, Palma, and Cartagena; the Italian navy could further isolate Malta from its base in Pantelleria, and British shipping routes would be greatly threatened, and the Mediterranean would really be in danger of becoming an "Italian inland sea."

Due to geographical proximity, a fascist Spain poses an even greater threat to France. The communications from Toulon in mainland France to places such as Bizerte in North Africa represent the cornerstone of France's hegemony in the western Mediterranean. If the Spanish Mediterranean coast falls into the hands of fascist forces, then the triangle formed by Barcelona-Mahon-Cartagena in Spain will fundamentally destroy France's cornerstone in the western Mediterranean. Not only that, France and Spain are only separated by the Pyrenees Mountains. Since the fall of Barcelona, the border between France and the territory of the Spanish National Army is 600 li long, and France's southern face has been taken over by its Fascist enemy; it is now trapped on three sides.

Since the threat of a Fascist Spain to Britain and France is as described above, Britain and France, in order to protect their own interests, should abandon the "non-intervention" policy and actively assist the Spanish Republican government. That is the solution; but why are they insisting on recognizing the National Army government? To be honest, this is because they made a mistake from the beginning, and now the die is cast. It is too late to regret, so they can only make the best of a bad job and take this opportunity to step down.

However, they also have reasons to justify themselves. According to French Prime Minister Daladier's speech in the Chamber of Deputies on the 24th, the reasons for recognizing the National Army are approximately two points: (1) "Since the National Army government is the de facto government of Spain, France should establish good neighborly relations with it;" (2) "The interests that France maintains in Spain are extremely important, so it is necessary to send a formal representative to reside in the city of Burgos." The intentions of the British and French authorities are very clear. They want to please Franco before the Spanish government forces are completely defeated, in order to "offset the influence of Italy and Germany in Spain." Chamberlain has always been playing a "wishful thinking" game, believing that although Italian and German fascists can conquer Spain, they are unable to build Spain. Once the war is over, to build Spain, they must obey London's orders, at which time Britain can replace Mussolini to control Franco.

Chamberlain's plan may inevitably become an empty fantasy. Who does not know that Franco today can no longer have independent will. He is unable to withdraw foreign fascist troops, nor can he withdraw foreign troops. First, Mussolini is not a fool. Over the past two years, the sacrifices of the Blackshirt troops sent to the Iberian Peninsula by the tens of thousands, are they really for the purpose of "having no territorial ambition towards Spain"? The Italian volunteers still refuse to withdraw and will never withdraw. Second, the progress of Franco's army is mainly due to the strength of the Blackshirt army. Without the support of the Blackshirt army, Franco's puppet would not be able to stand. French Socialist Party member Isar once pointed out: "Previously, when National Army Commander Colonel Ruiz took a British ship to Menorca to discuss a peaceful handover with the government authorities, Italian pilots bombed the island, which shows that the Italian troops under the Spanish National Army obey Mussolini's orders and cannot be commanded by Franco." From this point, it can also be known that the Spain ruled by Franco is actually equivalent to the Spain in Mussolini's hands.

Now, the actions of Britain and France in recognizing the Spanish National Army government have aroused fierce opposition from the people in Britain and France. According to a Huitong telegram on the 26th, Spanish Prime Minister Negrin has also firmly declared that he will continue the resistance to the end. American journalist Fisher said it very incisively: "Spain cannot be conquered. Even if it is suppressed for a while, a civil war will still break out six months later. Franco can never bring peace."

The result of Britain and France recognizing the Spanish National Army government is nothing more than encouraging the greater ambitions of fascist aggressors and deepening the new international crisis. According to observations from political figures in Paris, there are signs that this new crisis may erupt in the middle of next month. Let's wait and see!

### Discussions on the Shanghai Municipal Council's Reply: A Joint Conference Held by Three Japanese Ministries; Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Issue New Instructions to Japanese Authorities in Shanghai; Seems to Acknowledge Fan's Reply as Acceptance in Principle; British Newspaper Reports Situation Unlikely to Develop Along Difficult Paths; Negotiations on Japanese Bombing of British Concession Concluded

(Tokyo) Fan Keqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Public Concession's Municipal Council, sent a reply on Saturday evening to Japanese Consul-General Miura, responding to the Japanese side's "Basic Proposal to Eliminate Illegal Elements in the Public Concession." This reply was forwarded to Tokyo on Sunday, and this morning, the three ministries of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs held a joint conference to discuss issuing new instructions to the Japanese authorities in Shanghai regarding this reply. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue new instructions after the meeting. According to a telegram from Shanghai, Japanese diplomatic, army, and naval authorities in Shanghai held an emergency meeting on the flagship Izumo yesterday morning to discuss Fan Keqing's reply. The content of the reply has not been released, but according to newspaper reports, the Shanghai Municipal Council has shown no indication of changing its attitude. The Japanese authorities are determined not to alter their consistent peaceful approach towards the Municipal Council. However, if their peaceful approach is not reciprocated by the Municipal Council, the Japanese side's determination to eliminate illegal elements within the Public Concession by appropriate means will not change. The Asahi Shimbun reported that the Municipal Council's February 15 reply to the Japanese representative regarding the terrorist attacks was somewhat vague on certain points and did not intend to accept the specific details proposed by the Japanese side. However, today's meeting deemed it appropriate to "act leniently," at least temporarily acknowledging the Municipal Council's sincerity. Therefore, the Japanese representatives in Shanghai will likely meet with Chairman Fan Keqing today to present a second note, acknowledging Fan's reply as acceptance in principle. However, the Japanese representatives will continue to exert efforts in negotiations with the Municipal Council in Shanghai to achieve their specific demands. (Reuter, 27th)

(London) Most newspapers this morning prominently featured news of the Japanese warning to the Shanghai Public Concession and the Japanese threat to British territory, with headlines such as "Japan Warns Shanghai Public Concession" and "Japan Threatens British Territory," regarding the Japanese side's potential actions to suppress terrorists within the Shanghai Public Concession. However, there were no commentaries on the Shanghai Municipal Council. The diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph reported that London had not received any formal new information regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council last night. Judging from the situation on Saturday, it is hoped that the situation will not develop along a very difficult path. However, the situation in Tianjin is more concerning, and London is closely monitoring it. The correspondent further stated that the British government is reportedly satisfied with Japan's apology, acceptance of indemnity, and expressions regarding the bombing of Hong Kong territory. (Reuter, 27th)

(London) Regarding the bombing of the New Territories across from Hong Kong by Japanese aircraft, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that the British government considers the matter closed after the Japanese government presented a reply to the British government expressing deep regret, stating that the responsible personnel would be punished, and that the issue of compensation would be negotiated directly between the British and Japanese authorities. (Havas, 27th)

(London) During a House of Commons meeting today, Conservative MP Sir Milner asked Under-Secretary Butler whether he had taken note of the demands made by the Japanese authorities in Shanghai. Butler replied in the affirmative, stating that the Japanese side's proposals for more effective methods of maintaining law and order in Shanghai are currently under consideration by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The British government is closely monitoring the overall situation and will continue, as in the past, to provide the Municipal Council with possible advice and assistance. The issue of increasing defenses within the Public Concession is a matter for the Municipal Council to decide. (Reuter, 27th)

However, a phone call was received from Miura, notifying Fan that the agreed-upon meeting had to be postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. At that time, no reason was given for the incident, nor was it stated when the postponement would be until. As of last night, there was still no news.

### Kunming Authorities Prevent Fire Hazards During Air Raids

(Kunming) The authorities are currently exploring strict measures to reduce fire damage after air raids and have ordered the following methods to be implemented: A special brick wall must be built in place of an earthen wall every five shops along the thoroughfares; one shop must be demolished every thirteen shops to leave open space. The order specifies a deadline of one month, and those who do not comply will be severely punished. Since Kunming was bombed on December 26th of last year, it has been peaceful since then, but the city is becoming increasingly important, and precautions must be taken. After Guiyang was bombed and suffered heavy losses, some residents of Kunming have left the city to live in the countryside. (Reuter, 27th)

Former Spanish Republican Ambassador to France, Albornoz, told reporters from the Paris Evening News that President Azaña's resignation would be announced tomorrow afternoon. As for General Miaja, commander-in-chief of the Spanish Republican army, he will continue the war of resistance after Britain and France recognize the Nationalist government. In addition, the Paris Evening News carried a dispatch from a London correspondent stating that when Prime Minister Chamberlain announces the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government in the House of Commons tomorrow afternoon, he is expected to announce that General Franco has made two guarantees to the British commercial representative in Burgos, Sir Hogsetts:  Republican government personnel will not be subjected to retaliation because of political differences, meaning only those who have committed criminal offenses will be prosecuted.  The independence and sovereignty of Spain will be maintained. (Havas, 26th)

(London) As Britain will announce the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government tomorrow, disturbances broke out in the Downing Street area yesterday afternoon. An anti-government demonstration was held in Trafalgar Square. Labour leader Attlee and two other famous Labour MPs, Mr. Morrison and Ms. Wilkinson, addressed the crowd. A resolution was passed condemning the government's policy as shameful and detestable. The crowd wanted to march to Downing Street, but the resolution was carried by Attlee, Morrison, and other leaders in cars to the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street. A large number of people followed on foot, chanting slogans along the way. When they arrived at the entrance of Downing Street, it was guarded by cavalry. Apart from a slight clash between a group of people waving the Spanish national flag and the police, no serious incidents occurred. (Reuter, 27th)

### British Economic Director Returns from Germany

(Berlin) Mr. Waterlow, Director of the Economic Department of the British Foreign Office, came here to hold talks with leaders of the German government and economic circles to prepare for economic negotiations between Britain and Germany. After spending a week here, he left for home this evening. (Havas, 26th)

(London) The Daily Express and the Financial Times both report that during his stay in Berlin, Mr. Waterlow, Director of the Economic Department of the British Foreign Office, discussed the colonial issue with the German authorities. The Financial Times also reports that "the German side insists that an understanding on the colonial issue should be reached before Britain and Germany restore regular economic relations, but this does not mean that Germany's old colonies must be returned." After Waterlow returns home, he will submit a written report to Foreign Secretary Halifax. (Havas, 27th)

The German Dortmunder "Westdeutsche Tageszeitung" recently published an article defending Germany's demands for the restoration of its former colonies and explaining why Germany does not ask Japan to return the mandated territories (i.e., the Caroline Islands, the Marshall Islands, and the Mariana Islands, which were originally German colonies before the First World War and are now Japanese mandated territories). The article stated: "These islands are very small in area, compared to the German colonies in Africa that the British Empire has acquired. Those who want to recover their old homes must demand their entire return and will not haggle over a single building or tree. This is very clear." (Havas, 26th)

### Mrs. Lenin Passes Away

(Moscow) Mrs. Krupskaya Lenin, just after celebrating her 70th birthday yesterday, suddenly passed away at 6:15 AM this morning. Mrs. Lenin was born in 1869 in the city of Volga. She began as a female teacher and joined the Communist Party in 1898. She was arrested and imprisoned for inciting labor unrest and exiled to Siberia. She married Lenin in the frozen wilderness. After the end of their exile, the couple fled abroad together, remaining close and sharing hardships. After the completion of the 1917 revolution, Mrs. Lenin served as Acting Chairman of the Education Committee and later as Minister of Political Education. She was later elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party. Subsequently, in 1925, she formed an opposition faction with Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Kamenev. She later broke away from her father, rejoined the cadre faction, and served as Director of the National Library Administration until now. (Havas, 27th)

### Aircraft Factory Established in Hanoi

Hanoi: The authorities of French Indochina have decided to build an aircraft factory here. Construction will begin soon, with plans to manufacture 150 military aircraft and 400 engines annually. (Havas, 27th)

### Spanish Political Situation: Rumors of Imminent Restoration; Franco to Serve as Regent in Transition; British Side Said to Approve

(Paris) The Matin recently carried a dispatch from its London correspondent stating that General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist army, is said to be planning to implement a restoration in the short term, granting limited privileges to the new monarch. If this comes to pass, then the deposed Prince Juan, the heir to the throne, will certainly be welcomed back to ascend the throne. (Havas, 27th)

(London) An important figure who has just returned from Burgos, Spain, said that once the civil war in the country ends and unification is achieved, General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist army, will serve as regent of the Spanish Empire, in preparation for the restoration of the deposed Prince Juan, the heir to the throne. Although the British government has not expressed its opinion on the future political system of Spain, it is well known that the royal family wishes to see the Duke of Alba, Spain's informal representative in London, ascend to the throne. However, opinions around General Franco are also divided. For example, the Carlist faction advocates restoration, while the Fascist Spanish Phalanx advocates a strong dictatorship. They have been at odds with each other until now and have not been able to reach a consensus. Furthermore, Germany and Italy view the restoration as a clear declaration of Spain's willingness to maintain its independence, which is not in their interests and will certainly be obstructed. However, it can be asserted that the Catholic Church, especially the Jesuits, enjoys significant influence in the territory under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Nationalist government and can exert a decisive influence on the country's future political system. (Havas, 26th)

### Japanese Economy Gradually Changes; Affected by the War

(Tokyo) The Japanese government plans to mobilize all retailers across the country from July 1st of this year, requiring them to report the gross amount of goods sold in the past twelve months and their value, in order to conduct a nationwide goods survey. As the war against China cannot be concluded in a short time, the Japanese government plans to have a long-term construction plan to transform Japan's economic system. It is expected that the goods survey will have a far-reaching impact on this initiative. The government has collected all the necessary data on major goods, but regarding the consumption of daily necessities that are essential to the lives of the people, there is no way to conduct the survey due to numerous difficulties. After the recent passage of a law, it is now possible to carry out the goods survey. (Reuter, 27th)

### Former Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, Passes Away in the United States

(Washington) Former Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Hiroshi Saito, has been suffering from lung disease since he left office last fall and has been receiving medical treatment in the United States. He has not recovered, and his condition suddenly worsened today, leading to his death. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement upon hearing the news, expressing his condolences. He stated that since Ambassador Saito was sent to the United States in 1934, he worked diligently to establish good relations between Japan and the United States, exhausting his efforts and becoming ill from overwork, leading to his passing. Throughout his life, he was worthy of being called a loyal servant of the Japanese Emperor and the Japanese nation. Upon hearing the news, friends from all countries will surely mourn his death. (Havas, 26th)

(Washington) Former Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, passed away today due to a long-standing illness at the age of fifty-two. He previously served as Consul-General in New York and Minister to the Netherlands. (Reuter, 26th)

### Where is Poland Going? Students Again Hold Anti-German Demonstrations; Ciano Meets with Beck Again

Warsaw: Colonel Tomaszewski, leader of the Polish "Student Army," initiated an anti-German demonstration at the University of Warsaw today. Prior to this, he obtained special permission from Prime Minister General Składkowski. Deputy Minister of the Army, General Grudzinski, along with several officers from the General Staff, also attended the event. Colonel Tomaszewski addressed the crowd, stating that the youth of the nation must prepare to sacrifice. "We have nothing to return to others; what we should demand from others is inexhaustible." The students then shouted, "Long live Polish Danzig! Long live Polish East Prussia!" Colonel Tomaszewski continued, "The Free City of Danzig is a boil on Poland's body that must be excised." (Meaning that Danzig should be reclaimed by Poland.) The students then shouted, "Foreign Minister Beck is a quack!" Colonel Tomaszewski concluded by saying that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is a friend of Poland, and the student community should avoid causing trouble during his visit. To prevent disturbances, the police authorities dispatched officers to force the students to leave the University of Warsaw. (Havas, 26th)

Warsaw: Approximately 5,000 residents of Gdynia in northern Poland held an anti-German demonstration yesterday, shouting "Forward to Danzig!" and attempting to approach the German Consulate, but were dispersed by the police. (Havas, 27th)

Warsaw: Sunday passed peacefully here due to the strict precautions taken by the authorities. There were no further anti-German demonstrations yesterday. The University of Warsaw and the German Embassy had guards stationed. As Italian Foreign Minister Ciano drove along the main street in a car, a small group of students shouted slogans such as "Long live Italy and France!" and "Down with Germany!" (Reuters, 26th)

Warsaw: Following the repeated anti-German demonstrations by Polish university students, the local newspapers, under the direction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressed regret. They stated, "It is regrettable that disputes arose between German and Polish students at the Danzig School of Arts and Crafts after the school groundlessly expelled several Polish students. It is understandable that students within Poland hold politically-oriented demonstrations to support the expelled students. However, it is inappropriate for troublemakers to involve themselves in Poland's foreign policy. The government has now taken effective measures to stop the demonstrations. It should be known that such demonstrations, no matter how justified the cause, are sufficient to put the government at a disadvantage. Newspapers and politicians hostile to Poland can use this as material for slander, thereby harming Poland's national interests. It is hoped that the youth of our country will appreciate this and demonstrate the virtues of respecting national discipline." (Havas, 27th)

(Berlin): Following the anti-German demonstrations that have occurred in Poland for several consecutive days, political figures here have not yet expressed any views, but are deeply displeased. The German government has taken note of the Polish government's expression of apology. Due to the presence of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Warsaw, it is considered more appropriate to remain silent. At the same time, the German Embassy in Warsaw has been instructed to conduct an investigation and, if necessary, take appropriate measures to deal with the situation. (Havas, 27th)

Warsaw: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at noon today and held talks with Foreign Minister Beck for one hour. In the afternoon, he paid a visit to President Mościcki. (Havas, 26th)

Warsaw: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met with Polish Foreign Minister Beck this afternoon. It is rumored that Ciano pressed the Polish side to clearly express its attitude toward Italy's demands on France. Foreign Minister Beck apparently wanted Mussolini to explain his attitude towards Germany's expansion of commercial and political power in southeastern Europe. Poland is disappointed that the previous arbitration between Germany and Italy did not award Ruthenia to Hungary to serve as a border between Poland and Hungary. Various circles in Poland believe that the current border is a potential source of conflict and a center for Ukrainian anti-Polish propaganda. (Reuters, 26th)

Warsaw: Several Italian journalists were drinking in a tavern and ordered the band to play Italian songs, which they joined in singing. Although the musicians complied, after playing the Italian songs, they immediately followed with the famous British song "It's a Long Way to Tipperary." The Polish customers also joined in. The Italian journalists, feeling deflated, left their seats and departed. (Havas, 26th)

(Paris): The right-wing Figaro recently published a dispatch from a visiting reporter stating, "According to the Italian delegation, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is currently visiting Poland, and Italy believes that Poland's current foreign policy is somewhat contradictory. This is because the country has a military alliance treaty with France and Romania, while also signing non-aggression pacts with Germany and the Soviet Union." However, Polish political figures believe that this policy is not contradictory and there is no intention to change it. In other words, although the country wishes to establish extremely friendly relations with Italy, it will continue to honor its alliance with France and Poland. (Havas, 27th)

### The Palestine Question: Jewish People Reject British Solution; Arab People Insist on Establishing an Independent Nation; Bombs Explode in Various Parts of Palestine

(London): The Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency has decided to reject the British plan for solving the Palestine problem. Dr. Weizmann will announce this intention when the British formally present this proposal today. (Reuters, 27th)

(London): Jewish people are expressing dissatisfaction with the British draft solution to the Palestine problem, considering it a betrayal of the Jewish people and a violation of the Balfour Declaration. They see it as a move that changes British policy and opens the way for an independent Arab state. (Reuters, 27th)

Jerusalem: Jewish people in Jerusalem are holding meetings today to protest the British proposed solution for Palestine. They say that the Jewish people will never submit to any attempt at force or accept a minority status, even with any guarantees. (Reuters, 27th)

(London): Regarding the Palestine problem, the Jewish community is strongly opposed to the solution proposed by the British government. Therefore, representatives of the Jewish community refused to attend a banquet hosted by the British government at noon today to show their protest. A key figure in the Zionist movement issued a statement saying, "The Jewish people around the world will be shocked and anxious to learn that the British government intends to establish an independent Arab state in Palestine. In this situation, it would be inappropriate to rashly attend the British government's banquet." (Havas, 27th)

Tel Aviv: The Jewish Municipal Council of this city has passed a resolution expressing opposition to the British government's proposed solution to the Palestine problem, stating briefly that the revitalization efforts of the Jewish nation cannot be allowed to be extinguished. They also sent a telegram to British Colonial Secretary MacDonald, stating that this solution is contrary to the obligations accepted by the British government and the rights enjoyed by the Jewish people, and is unjust. (Havas, 27th)

Jerusalem: Regarding the Palestine problem, the Jewish Agency here has issued a declaration strongly opposing the British government's proposed solution, stating briefly, "This plan is tantamount to fundamentally overturning the Jewish plan to build a country in Palestine. The Jewish people in Palestine and around the world will undoubtedly fiercely resist it. This Agency hereby solemnly declares that any solution that attempts to restrict the free development of the Jewish people in Palestine and forces them to accept a minority status is unacceptable to the Jewish people." In addition, Jewish groups, such as the right-wing Zionist group led by Jabotinsky, the labor group led by Katznelson, and the moderates led by Weizmann, chairman of the Jewish Agency, have differing opinions. Due to the seriousness of the situation, they have decided to set aside their differences and establish a united front in order to concentrate their forces to oppose the solution proposed by the British. (Havas, 26th)

(London): According to sources from the Palestine Conference, when the British government proposes convening a round table conference this autumn, the Arab representatives will reiterate their demand for the establishment of an independent Arab state in Palestine, or they will propose that the current representatives in London organize a round table conference to discuss everything, with particular emphasis on protecting the interests of the British and the British community in Palestine. (Reuters, 26th)

Jerusalem: Regarding the Palestine problem, after the British government proposed a solution to establish an independent Arab nation, the Arab residents of various cities and villages in Palestine were overjoyed, with slogans such as "We demand true independence!" and cheers such as "Long live Chamberlain!" and "Long live the Grand Mufti of Palestine!" Fireworks were set off on various hilltops to celebrate. (Havas, 27th)

Jerusalem: Regarding the Palestine problem, since the British government proposed a solution, the Arabs here welcome it because their community can enjoy privileges in Palestine, making it easy to move towards complete independence. Residents of the Arab communities in major cities such as Haifa, Jaffa, and Tulkarem have held rallies and parades through the main streets, singing various songs with great enthusiasm. However, terrorist activities in various places have not subsided, but have intensified. (Havas, 26th)

Jerusalem: Several terrorist incidents occurred in the cities of Palestine this morning, with many deaths and injuries among the Jewish and Arab populations. The authorities have taken preventive measures. The situation in the port of Tel Aviv is particularly serious, with six bombs exploding, killing 26 people and injuring 47. Two bombs also exploded on the railway tracks, but there were no casualties. In addition, one Arab was shot and killed. A public bus carrying Arabs was also ambushed by gunfire, but there were no casualties. Several bombs were found in the market of the port city of Haifa, killing 29 Arabs and injuring 38, including two Jewish policemen. The bombs at the train station and courthouse did not cause any injuries. In Jaffa, nine bombs only injured two people. In Jerusalem, two bombs killed four Arabs and injured seven. A train traveling from Tel Aviv to Lydda derailed, injuring five people. (Havas, 27th)

### Italian Residents in France: First Group Returns Home

Turin: Italian residents in France are returning to their homeland. The first group of 1,400 people arrived here today. Fascist Party Secretary General Starace came from Rome to welcome them, and the entire city held a celebration. (Havas, 27th)

(Paris): The newspaper "La République" recently reported, "Last November, the Italian government organized a committee to coordinate the return of Italian residents in various countries to their homeland and be responsible for this matter. Since then, only one hundred of the 120,000 Italian residents in Marseille have returned to Italy, and only about four or five hundred others are preparing to return. Most of these are usually subsidized by Italian residents' associations. Very few Italian residents in Paris have returned home. As far as the situation across the country is concerned, the vast majority of Italian residents want to stay in France and many want to naturalize as French citizens, but they have not been able to realize their wishes due to the many procedural difficulties. Since the situation is like this, when will our country finally implement a large-scale assimilation policy?" (Havas, 27th)

### Japanese Troops in a Difficult Position; Guerrilla Warfare Active in Guangdong Province; Chinese Troops Unite to Surround Japanese Troops in Various War Zones

Hong Kong Correspondence: In recent months, the Japanese army has expanded its invasion of southern China, using tens of thousands of troops to launch a large-scale offensive against Hainan Island. With the assistance of the navy and air force, they managed to land in Haikou City in Qiongshan County and Sanya Port in Yaxian County. However, after landing, they only occupied a few points along the coast. As soon as they advanced inland, they were repeatedly ambushed by the Chinese army, suffering great losses. So far, they are still blocked north of Longtang and Anren in Ding'an County. In the south, the east and west routes of Sanya Port have not yet been connected. Their foothold is difficult to maintain without the protection of naval ships. The Japanese military authorities seem to have a sense of being trapped in a quagmire at this time. However, having mounted the tiger, they have no choice but to increase their troops to support the difficult situation of their so-called southern expeditionary force. As a result, troops have been secretly withdrawn from the Xijiang (West River) area in Guangdong Province. For the past two weeks, the fighting in the Xijiang area has suddenly become quiet, for this reason.

Repeated Attacks Unsuccessful: Recently, while the Japanese army was engaged in operations on Hainan Island, the Chinese army called on guerrillas in various places to coordinate with the regular army and prepare to surround the Japanese troops in various war zones. In the Xijiang area, the guerrillas under the command of Lu are now scattered in the areas of Mabao, Mian, and Sanshui. They recently inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese army near Fanhe Township. The guerrillas near Jiujiang, belonging to the Li Fulin's troops, have twice raided the Japanese camp in Jiujiang at night, and have repeatedly ambushed Japanese stragglers between Jiujiang and Longjiang, achieving victories. The first guerrilla war zone in Guangdong Province includes the counties of Nanhai and Panyu. The south of Panyu was originally the guerrilla base of Li Fulin's troops and has long been a pain in the side for the Japanese army in Humen. Later, the Japanese army detected that the main force of Li's troops was in Datang in Panyu, so they launched a fierce attack on Datang with more than a thousand cavalry and infantry, and six Japanese aircraft took turns bombing. The Datang guerrillas safely withdrew from the southern part of Panyu because the fortifications were destroyed. However, a part of them are still stationed in the towns of Sanshan and Shibi in the southern part of Panyu, restraining Japanese troop transport. The Japanese army sent more than a hundred men, taking the Zhujiang River, to harass the towns of Sanshan and Dazhou by rubber boat. The guerrillas of the town engaged the approaching Japanese army head-on, killing dozens of them on the spot. The Japanese aircraft then arrived to provide support, and the guerrillas in the town avoided their fierce power and retreated while fighting. After the Japanese army invaded Dazhou Township, they pursued and spied on Shibi Township. The guerrillas held out against them for more than twenty hours, gaining considerable compensation, and then safely retreated. The Japanese army gained nothing except looting food and raping women in the towns they broke into. Later, they changed their route and attacked Sanshan by boat. The town faces the river and backs onto the mountains, a natural fortress, and hundreds of Japanese troops were unable to attack it. However, Pingzhou Township near Sanshan Township has been looted by the Japanese army several times.

Fierce Fighting in Northern Panyu: The guerrilla team in northern Panyu (i.e., the northern part of Panyu, bordering Conghua and Huaxian), has always been commanded by Wu Guanhong. Wu is a military strategist and once served as the leader of the Self-Defense Force, with rich experience in the organization of local militias. When the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, they drove their troops to invade northern Panyu and Conghua in order to consolidate the outer defense line of Guangzhou. The guerrilla team in northern Panyu rose up in various places such as Wuhewei and Dagangwei. When the Japanese army invaded Guotang (a station on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway), Wu's troops moved to Guotang and attacked them, annihilating hundreds of Japanese troops. The Japanese army knew the location of Wu's troops, and the next day sent aircraft to bomb the villages around Guotang, killing more than a hundred innocent civilians. Seven or eight out of ten of the villagers' houses were destroyed, and five or six hundred refugees were displaced. The Dongjiang people have always been known for their bravery. The Japanese army was frightened by the several battles in Luofu Mountain, so they hurriedly withdrew from Huibo to Zengcheng, Dongguan, and Taiping, shortening their defense line. However, the Dongjiang guerrillas still ventured deep into the interior.

### Continued Guerrilla Warfare on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line; Chinese Troops Charge into Mudu Town; Pseudo-Battalion Commander Ji Zongxian Killed

Wujin Correspondence: Since the central government intentionally adjusted the guerrilla forces in the eastern war zone, the various units have shifted from scattered individual operations to planned and unified operations. Now, all units have been ordered to actively surround important strongholds, so fierce battles have occurred along the Nanjing-Shanghai line in the past ten days, especially in Wujin, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Jiangyin counties. On the 20th, the Wuxi mobile unit took advantage of the Japanese army's departure to the northern countryside and attacked the county seat, encountering a fierce battle with the Japanese and puppet troops near Dongting. After suffering losses, the mobile unit retreated to the vicinity of Xuelang Mountain at dawn on the 21st.

In Wujin, a large unit of puppet troops in Qijia-Pan near Panshu was completely disarmed by the Chinese army. On the evening of the 18th, the mobile team entered the city and confiscated all 28 guns and 4,300 rounds of ammunition from the police station in the city. When the Japanese army saw the Chinese army entering the city, they were panicked and at a loss. Now, the Chinese army has been ordered to concentrate in a certain place, waiting for the general attack.

The Suzhou Mobile Brigade and the Nanjing-Shanghai Action Team in the Dongzhu, Jinshu, Tong'anqiao, Xihua, and Tandong areas are now actively pursuing the city of Suzhou. The Jiangnan 6th County Guerrilla Commander Xiong, specially sent by the Mobile Brigade Headquarters stationed in Changshu, has also crossed Yangcheng Lake and is advancing towards Suzhou. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, the team sent personnel to distribute the "Regulations for Traitors to Surrender" to the residences of various puppet officials in the city of Suzhou, hoping that the traitors would quickly realize their mistakes and participate in the resistance war. The Japanese side is terrified, entrenched in cement fortifications, as if facing a great enemy. On the night of the 16th, the mobile team attacked Mudu Town, killing the pseudo-Sui army battalion commander Ji Zongxian on the spot, and his troops were also disarmed. The Japanese instructor Gai Ben barely escaped with his life. Furthermore, the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the pseudo-Sui 3rd District stationed in the Wujiang and Zhenze areas were also completely disarmed by the Chinese army. When the Chinese army went to disarm them, the officers and soldiers of the team understood the righteousness and did not return a single shot, because they deeply hated being betrayed by Cheng Wanjun alone. The Action Team of the Mobile Brigade, which operates in Jiangyin, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places, has recently dispatched a large number of specially trained personnel from the Brigade Headquarters to establish "Jiangsu Youth Actively Loyal to the Government Movement Study Tour Expansion and Promotion" in various counties in the interior, and the youth participating are very enthusiastic. In order to improve work efficiency, the team established the Shanghai Suburban Action Team and appointed Miao Sen as its leader. The Hangzhou Team Leader Shen Beihai and the Nanjing Team Leader Xiao Gang have also arrived at their posts one after another. The team's special affairs负责人强雷则因向总队部有所请示、故巳离沪、

### Current Situation in Haimen, Under Japanese Surveillance; Japanese Warships Attack Various Small Islands, Attempting to Land Unsuccessfully

Haimen Correspondence: Haimen, Zhejiang Province, is one of the leading towns in Linhai, not only the center of politics, culture, economy, and commerce in Taizhou, but also a hub of transportation in eastern Zhejiang. The residents of the coastal area make a living by fishing, while the residents of the mountainous area mostly cultivate the mountains, so the main products are aquatic products, rice, and tea. Indigo and Taizhou oranges are also very abundant. The folk customs are fierce and combative, and most of the weapons are made by themselves, so violent fights often occur due to trivial reasons, which the government cannot prohibit. The folk organizations and factions are complex. The most famous are the "Big Ghosts" and "Little Ghosts" gangs. The organization of each gang is very planned and the strength is quite sound. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the local people was extremely high. The Seventh Administrative Inspectorate of Zhejiang Province is located in Haimen and is responsible for defense. Taihu Guerrilla Commander Xing Zhennan, who is currently the Inspector, has armed the entire Haimen. All the strong men, national soldiers, and police teams are organized into four major battalions. The District Chief兼Public Security Bureau Director暨兼Battalion Commander, Township Head兼Company Commander. Local patriotic people have long organized the Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Committee, the Political Work Team, and the Political Propaganda Team. The streets and alleys are filled with anti-war documents, slogans, and wall newspapers. Wartime mobile education is conducted to educate the people as much as possible. The wartime mass mobilization inspection and guidance team inspects the streets from time to time, and at the same time, recruits strong men according to conscription. Fathers and sons, brothers, and many compete to enlist in the army, considering it an honor. The large and small bandit groups in the mountains, which were originally as numerous as hairs, have now surrendered one after another, petitioning the authorities to be incorporated. Several times last year, it was discovered that traitors attempted to cause trouble in the rear, so for the past six months, the Wen-Tai Defense Headquarters organized a martial law inspection station, limiting the number of ships and strictly inspecting passengers landing on shore, requiring identification cards with the person's fingerprints and guarantees from more than three shops. Recently, it has been rumored that traitors from Shanghai have sneaked into the Wen-Tai area to instigate bandits to surrender, but it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve any results. Haimen has long been watched by the Japanese army. On August 25 last year, Japanese aircraft bombed repeatedly, destroying almost the entire county chamber of commerce near the center of Haimen City, and many people were killed and injured. In recent times, Japanese warships have continued to attack various small islands off the coast, attempting to land, but the Chinese defenders are waiting in full battle array, and it is feared that the Japanese army will not easily succeed.

### Duty-Free Foreign Rice Shipped to Shantou to Relieve Famine: Panic Over People's Food in Chaozhou and Meizhou Now a Thing of the Past

Shantou Correspondence: Since the beginning of winter, grain prices in various parts of Chaozhou and Meizhou have skyrocketed. Consequently, each county has banned the export of grain, preventing mutual assistance. For instance, Yunxiao, Zhao'an, and Zhangpu counties in southern Fujian usually ship surplus rice to Chaozhou and Shantou every year. Recently, local garrisons, fearing that unscrupulous merchants would aid the enemy, have prohibited the export of grain. The same is true for Raoping and Jieyang counties in Chaozhou. Villagers carrying white rice on their shoulders to sell or exchange for other goods in neighboring counties are also intercepted by the district and township offices' police, accused of smuggling it out of the area. Initially, the boundary was between provinces; later, it became between counties, also called smuggling. Dabu County cannot purchase rice from Raoping. After the price of rice became expensive, even districts and townships within the same county demarcated boundaries. Rice from Raoping city heading to Huanggang and Fushan districts can be intercepted mid-way; even if only three or five families are involved, they are not spared. Those enforcing the orders disregard the facts and merely create self-imposed restrictions, causing villages that do not produce rice to be unable to purchase it. The price of rice is four or five yuan per catty. Last autumn, Chaozhou and Meizhou had bumper harvests, yet they are experiencing a rice shortage, which is truly strange. Various organizations have sent telegrams to the Ministry of Finance, requesting immediate relief measures, advocating for the temporary duty-free import of foreign rice. The Hong Kong China Rice Company imported a large quantity of foreign rice last year (all imported duty-free). Among them, the stock stored in Guangzhou suffered losses of hundreds of thousands of bags due to the sudden arrival of the Japanese army. The stock stored in Hong Kong warehouses will be addressed after a shareholders' meeting. The Shantou Provincial Bank has specifically borrowed funds on behalf of the State Rice Operation Company to transport rice to Chaozhou and Shantou for famine relief. The first batch of 45,000 bags arrived on the 11th, transported by Desheng Shipping, duty-free. The second and third batches will continue to arrive. As a result, the current price of rice is 11 yuan and 75 cents per dan in national currency, and it is expected to continue to decline. The reason is that rice-producing villages are not short of rice. Rice from Fujian and Jiangxi can still be carried to Meixian. The upper reaches of the Han River do not urgently need foreign rice for relief.

### Construction in the Rear is Intensifying: Sichuan-Kangding Highway Being Actively Built; Indian Tea Encroachment Greatly Affects Tea

Ya'an Correspondence: On the 14th, the reporter left Chengdu by car for Xikang, heading southwest from the station into the suburbs.

On the Chengdu-Ya'an Road: Outside Jinjiang City, fields crisscross. The morning sun shines through the thin mist, directly illuminating the dense trees, a lush scene with a hint of emerald green, making the scenery even more beautiful. Along the roadside, a row of red walls surrounds ancient towering cypress trees, which is the Wuhou Shrine. The reporter had visited it the day before, featuring statues of Wuhou and Emperor Zhaolie, magnificent halls, and numerous steles. Although troops are stationed there, visitors are not prevented. In the last hall with the statue of Wuhou, there is a stele engraved with Du Fu's poem, "Where can the Prime Minister's shrine be found? Cypress trees stand dense outside Jin Guan City," reading to the line "Dying before his task was accomplished," one cannot help but feel a sense of melancholy. Behind the hall is a high tomb, the burial place of Emperor Zhaolie. The spirit of Liu Xiang, the former chairman of Sichuan, is enshrined in the west courtyard, and tourists are prohibited from entering. The car arrived in Shuangliu County, stopping to refuel. It was heard that a certain senior central official was reviewing troops here. Continuing forward, crossing two small rivers, at eleven o'clock, it arrived at the old county, stopping for lunch. Passing through Xinjin County to Yang'an Town, stones and pebbles piled up, making the car ride quite bumpy. Crossing another small river, it arrived in Qionglai County, a bustling and lively market town. Legend has it that Sima Xiangru of the Han Dynasty met Zhuo Wenjun here and seduced her with music. The car carried the "Biography of Sima Xiangru" from the "Records of the Grand Historian." The county has the Qin Platform of Changqing and the Well of Wenjun, but due to the hurried journey, there was no time to admire the romantic relics. Continuing forward, villages connected swiftly, and the population became denser. However, along the way, most of the men and women carrying loads were wearing tattered clothes, barely covering their bodies. The hardship of the people in western Sichuan can be imagined. The car passed through Wolongchang, Datangchang, Heizhuyuan, Baizhangyi, and other stations. The mountains stretched out, from far to near, already close to the Qionglai Mountains. Although the hills were continuous, the road on top was as flat as a whetstone, and the car traveled like flying. It arrived in Mingshan County, a very small city, mostly damaged and dilapidated, in urgent need of repair. The county is surrounded by mountains, making its terrain dangerous, thus becoming an important military stronghold. Passing Mingshan, large mountains stood on both sides, winding continuously. At times, evening mist gradually rose, and the evening breeze brought cold, creating a desolate wilderness, giving a sense of borderland atmosphere. The car arrived at Jinji Bridge, only twenty-odd miles from Ya'an. The bridge is the boundary between Mingshan and Ya'an counties, also the border between Sichuan and Xikang provinces. Passing Jinji Mountain, the car climbed over the hilltop for more than ten minutes. Legend has it that a golden rooster crowed here, and the mountain shape resembles a golden rooster spreading its wings. Descending the slope, it arrived at Jinjiguan, the first important pass between Mingshan and Ya'an, a strategic location for military strategists. From here, one can see the Mengding of northern Ya'an from afar. Around four o'clock in the afternoon, it arrived in Ya'an, lodging at the Xinsheng Travel Agency. The 360-li journey between Chengdu and Ya'an came to an end.

Recent View of Ya'an: Ya'an in the Three Dynasties was originally the Qingyi State, belonging to Liang Province in the Tribute of Yu, a place inhabited by various southwestern Yi peoples, with the Qiang people being the most prominent. During the Qin Dynasty, the Chu Yan clan was relocated here to strengthen it, establishing Yan'dao County, belonging to Shu County. Before the Ming Dynasty, whether there were city walls is unknown. It was not until the early Hongwu period that the great general Hu Dahai was ordered to supervise the construction of stone city walls. Even today, the character "Hu" can still be vaguely seen engraved on the city stones. The city is based on the upper reaches of the Qingyi River, also known as the Mo River, or the Pingqiang River, named after Zhuge Liang pacifying the Qiang rebellion here, commonly known as the Ya River. The county is bordered by the Min River to the east, the Dadu River to the west, the Qionglai Mountains to the north, and Mount Emei to the south. High peaks and deep valleys, with natural and steep terrain, control the vital passage between Sichuan and Tibet, a major town in eastern Kangding. Its Mengshan in the north produces the most famous tea. Legend has it that during the Ming Dynasty, a monk named Lizhen came from the Western Regions, bringing tea seeds to plant here. During the Qing Dynasty, it was harvested as tribute, named Xiantai, the so-called Mengding tea. To the southeast of the city is Cai Mountain. Legend has it that Zhuge Liang dreamed of the Duke of Zhou on this mountain during his southern expedition, and a temple was built for him, which still exists today, hence it is also known as Zhougong Mountain, one of the Eight Scenic Spots of Ya'an. When Ya'an was under the jurisdiction of Sichuan, it was originally a second-class county. After being劃劃劃劃划劃划划划劃 divided into Xikang, it will be promoted to a first-class county, administratively divided into four districts, with a population of about 130,000. Due to the lack of popular education, illiteracy accounts for more than half of the population. There are more than 80 elementary schools in the county. Within the city, there is the Ningyaqiong Joint Middle School, with more than 300 male and female students, a total of twelve classes in both senior and junior high. The monthly expenditure is more than 2,900 yuan, which has been issued by Kang Province since September last year. There are 29 faculty members, and the principal, Chen Yaoshu, a Sichuanese, is young, knowledgeable, and diligent in management, resulting in remarkable achievements and outstanding reputation. Tea is the most important product, and all five grains are available, with maize production being the highest, but food is not sufficient, and it is still necessary to rely on external counties. The annual tea production is more than two million catties, sold to Kang and Tibet, worth no less than three million yuan. Social economy relies on resource adjustment. There are Sichuan and Shaanxi tea merchants, and the sales still follow the guide system. In recent years, Indian tea has encroached, greatly affecting the border tea. In addition, a large number of Kang and Tibetan medicinal herbs are collected here and sold to Sichuan and Hubei, but since the outbreak of the war, it is not as prosperous as before. There are seven banks, including Sichuan, Xikang, and Chongqing, and their business is mostly related to tea and medicine. Zhenggong Street is the most prosperous commercial area, and roads have been built. Once the Sichuan-Kangding Highway is completed, the commerce of Ya'an will become even more prosperous. The Ya'an-Luding section of the highway has been built past Erlang Mountain, and there are currently more than 30,000 workers working there. The Ya'an County Government has recently recruited more than 8,000 workers, scheduled to start building the section between Erlang Mountain and Luding after the fifteenth day of the lunar new year. County Magistrate Xu Jian specifically went to the countryside to explain to the people the significance of recruiting workers to build roads and develop transportation. According to Wang Yongfu, deputy director of the Sichuan-Kangding Highway Engineering Office, the Ya'an-Kangding section can be completed within this year, and the steel, American-style suspension bridge over the Dadu River in Luding is being actively constructed, with a deadline for completion, so that traffic can be opened by the end of the year.

### Japanese Threat to the Hong Kong Border: Intrusion into Bao'an for Six Hours

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Lunar New Year in Hong Kong is even more lively than in Shanghai. The thoughts and actions of the Hong Kong Chinese are extremely stubborn, believing in gods and clinging to old customs, something never seen in other major cities in the country. At the same time, because Hong Kong is a British territory, the Sino-Japanese War cannot affect it. The number of wealthy refugees fleeing from various places is countless. Therefore, the Lunar New Year scene this year is even more enthusiastic than in previous years. The sound of firecrackers is endless day and night, and the singing and dancing halls, restaurants, and theaters are full, and the amount of waste is difficult to estimate. However, at this time, the Nantou and Shenzhen areas on the Hong Kong border are filled with the sound of artillery fire, and flesh and blood are everywhere. Only a few dozen miles away, heaven and hell are clearly separated. It is difficult to understand this. The Japanese army's threat to Hong Kong has never been so severe. At the time when the Japanese army fiercely attacked Hainan Island, this action was taken, which we must pay close attention to.

Bao'an Nantou Occupied in Succession: Bao'an is a county town on the east bank of the Pearl River Estuary, and Nantou is a coastal town in Bao'an County, both bordering the British leased territory of Hong Kong and Kowloon. When the Japanese army occupied Shenzhen last winter, Bao'an was once in danger, but soon the Japanese army occupying Shenzhen retreated, and Bao'an was unharmed. Currently, in Bao'an city and its surrounding areas, because there is the sea in front and no way to retreat behind, the Chinese army has long since withdrawn, with only a few police maintaining law and order. The area is not a strategic pass and has no military value. Unexpectedly, on New Year's Eve (the 17th), the Japanese army stationed in Taiping bypassed the Taibao Highway and advanced south, attacking Bao'an County on one side and Nantou fiercely on the other. At that time, the residents of both Bao'an and Nantou were still in their dreams, when they suddenly heard the sound of gunfire, getting closer and closer, so they fled in panic. The police in both places stepped forward to resist, but because of the disparity in numbers, many were killed and injured. By about six o'clock in the morning, Bao'an and Nantou had fallen one after another. Chinese police and local officials retreated to the Shatoujiao construction works to defend against the Japanese army attacking Shenzhen again. The Japanese army attacking Bao'an and Nantou numbered about 300, although they did not carry heavy weapons, they were fully equipped with machine guns and small artillery. After occupying Nantou, they appointed the traitor Zhang as the chairman of the maintenance committee, and the Japanese army then carried out large-scale searches, rapes, and massacres, doing everything. Another part of the Japanese army occupied Bao'an County, and after the occupation, the Taiping puppet maintenance committee chairman He, who came with the Japanese army, came forward to maintain order, on the one hand, not allowing residents to flee, and on the other hand, forcing the Dasanyuan Restaurant on Daxin Street in the city to be responsible for supplying the Japanese army with food and drink. Unexpectedly, just when the large and small traitors were in high spirits, the Japanese army suddenly received orders to withdraw, so the traitors also fled back to Taiping with the Japanese army. Bao'an County was occupied by the Japanese army for only six hours before and after, while the Japanese army in Nantou did not retreat until the morning of the next day (18th).

The Japanese Are Now Threatening Britain: Bao'an and Nantou are neither military strongholds nor have Chinese troops stationed there, and they are close to the British border, so the Japanese army has no need to attack. Since Shenzhen was once occupied by the Japanese army, after British negotiations, they withdrew, and the Chinese side also has no troops stationed there. Therefore, this sudden occupation of Bao'an Nantou and the bombing of Shenzhen by the Japanese army, and even more disregard for everything, intruding into British airspace and dropping bombs on British section stations and vehicles on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, appears to be a planned conspiracy. According to general observation, the only purpose of the Japanese army is to test Britain's true attitude and threaten Britain, so that it will not take a positive attitude towards the situation in South China. Since the Japanese army occupied Hainan Island, the attitudes of Britain and France have indeed been likely to become tougher, so they intentionally threatened the British again to find out the truth. Now the British side has protested against the new threats from the Japanese army and aircraft, and the development of the situation in South China will be even more watched.

### Chinese Army Commando Raids the Southern Section of Jinpu Railway: Two Japanese Military Trains Bombed

Huaiyin Correspondence: A certain battalion of the Chinese army commando, previously ordered to go to the southern section of the Jinpu Railway to engage in guerrilla warfare, has repeatedly destroyed the railway and raided Tianchang, repeatedly making outstanding achievements. The details are recorded below:

Destroying the Railway: A certain company of the battalion takes attacking Japanese military trains as its main task. On a certain day at the beginning of the month, Zhao, the battalion commander of the battalion, led his troops to advance towards the Mingguang area. Around 2:00 a.m., they arrived near Lishantou between Zhangsha and immediately destroyed the bridge, set up landmines, and buried explosives in sections. By about 7:00 a.m. the next morning, a Japanese military train arrived, triggering the landmines. Several feet of rails were completely destroyed, and a locomotive overturned on the roadside. The Japanese army disembarked in panic and bombarded everywhere with heavy artillery. The Chinese ambush replied with sparse gunshots and retreated immediately, while the Japanese army bombarded fiercely for several hours, consuming a lot of ammunition and leaving. On the evening of the 17th at 3:00 a.m., the battalion again contacted the armed civilians of Xuyi and buried landmines at both ends of the bridge near Wangcun Yingshantou, north of Guandian, and deployed a large number of ambushes around the railway, waiting for the opportunity to attack. By about 6:00 a.m. at dawn, a Japanese train arrived, with nineteen carriages, with armored vehicles at both ends, full of Japanese soldiers and small boats. Just as it arrived at the bridge, it detonated the landmines, and the locomotive and most of the train completely overturned on the roadside. Taking advantage of the chaos of the Japanese soldiers, the Chinese army suddenly attacked with hand grenades and machine guns, and the Japanese soldiers were caught off guard, killing more than 300 people, while the Chinese army suffered no losses.

In-Depth Tianchang: On the 22nd of the month, Chao, the battalion commander, considering that the Japanese army in Tianchang city was weak, specially selected 24 people from his troops to form a suicide squad, all in plain clothes, secretly carrying short guns, hand grenades and other weapons, at 11:00 a.m. taking advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness, occupied the west gate of the city and the west street in the city, and attacked the Japanese command headquarters. At the same time, the Chinese artillery stationed in Hejiadu also responded with artillery fire. After receiving the news, the Japanese army gathered in the park to resist stubbornly. The Chinese army, with the mission accomplished, safely returned to defense at 6:00 p.m. that day. In this battle, the Chinese army only used 24 people, staying in the city for seven hours, and wiped out more than a dozen guards, and seized three 38-type rifles and one light machine gun, which is truly a miracle.

### Stored in Zhejiang and Transported to Jiangxi: Large Quantities Shipped to Wenzhou for Export, Totaling 138,000 Boxes

Jinhua Correspondence: The green tea from Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, which had been stored in Lanxi last year, was a large quantity. With the approval of the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance, the Highway Bureau used cars to transport it to Lishui, and then transported it to Wenzhou for export. From September 16th last year to February 5th this year, it has been shipped, totaling more than 136,000 boxes. There are still more than 1,600 boxes of Wuyuan tea. Once shipped from Anhui to Lanxi, it will be shipped continuously on the same day.

### Fierce Fighting Near Hai'ning: Daughter of Puppet Official Shameless

Hai'ning Correspondence: Zhu Xi's Jiangnan Guerrilla Advance Team, joined with Jiang Shuwei's unit, attacked Wangdian Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line on the 22nd from three directions. The Japanese railway patrol team at Wangdian immediately rose to fight, and eight of them were killed. Several foreign bridges, such as No. 9 on the Hangzhou-Shanghai Highway, three miles west of Hai'ning City, were destroyed by the Chinese army, and the power lines were cut off. On the 23rd, they took advantage of the situation to recover Baishi Bridge southeast of Haining. Fierce fighting occurred between the two sides. The Chinese army rushed into Haining Town, and the daughter of the puppet magistrate Tan Yuqing, who was sleeping with Ren, the head of the Japanese appeasement squad, fled in panic that night. Later, the Chinese army temporarily retreated to the suburbs as a large number of Japanese reinforcements arrived. On the same day, 40 Japanese soldiers from Fengshumiao and Xieqiao were bravely defeated by Wu, the Chinese army's commander. Fengshumiao was then recovered by the Chinese army.

### Shanghai Education Circle: Opinions on Reforming Education - Continuing Education for In-Service Middle School Teachers After the Establishment of Normal Colleges (Part 4)

— Huang Shijin

The Difficulties and Solutions to Continuing Education for Middle School Teachers

Although continuing education for middle school teachers is important, if the difficulties in teachers' continuing education are not addressed, teachers may not be willing to pursue it even if they have the opportunity. The Zhejiang Education Department and Zhejiang University once jointly organized summer training workshops for educational service personnel. Despite great effort, only sixty-seven middle school teachers attended. Furthermore, the Shanghai Education Bureau once held training workshops for science teachers in secondary schools. Because of the low participation rate, the bureau issued a general order forcing schools to participate and threatened to terminate contracts. Therefore, if in-service teachers are to pursue continuing education, their difficulties must be understood, solutions must be found, effective measures must be established, and their motivation must be encouraged. The major difficulties teachers face in continuing education can be summarized as follows: (A) Economic Issues: Teachers' salaries are meager, and even daily expenses are difficult to cover. Educational expenses for children are hard to come by, so there are no surplus funds for their own continuing education. To address the economic issue, schools should provide appropriate financial assistance based on the length of service. After continuing education, their rank and salary should be increased. Continuing education institutions should waive tuition and board fees and increase the amount of scholarship money. (B) Family Issues: Some teachers lack the courage to temporarily leave their wives and children and are unwilling to leave their hometown, hindering their progress. The affections for children and the weakness of heroes are indeed a real difficulty, compounded by economic considerations, making it no wonder they cannot proceed. The key to resolving this problem lies mostly within the family. Those with foresight should strongly encourage the realization of continuing education plans and should not hinder them. Those who pursue continuing education can advance, while those who regress will inevitably be eliminated. Family members, with their deep concern, should carefully consider and kindly explain the situation, so it should not become a problem. (C) Psychological Issues: The self-sufficiency and complacency of teachers are the greatest enemies of continuing education. Teachers often feel that they can handle their current work, can follow the routine, and live out their lives in peace, so why bother with continuing education and go through all that trouble? To overcome this difficulty, the government must publish regulations on teacher continuing education, urge schools to implement them, and stipulate regulations for the employment of secondary school teachers, emphasizing qualifications for professional training. Schools should formulate measures for teacher continuing education and provide economic convenience and spiritual encouragement to teachers who are determined to pursue it. In addition, society should also create a strong atmosphere for teacher continuing education, making teachers feel that they are not qualified to be teachers without continuing education. (D) Continuing Education Institutions: Where can teachers go for continuing education? Can institutions responsible for teacher training provide teachers with convenient opportunities for continuing education? This was indeed a problem in the past. Now that normal colleges have been established in various regions across the country, this problem is relatively easier to solve. In addition to directly providing continuing education to high school and junior high school teachers through continuing education classes, normal colleges can also use other indirect methods that are also very effective. According to Article 4 of the Normal College Regulations, "Normal colleges should assist the educational administrative agencies in their designated regions in researching and assisting the secondary education within the region." Within the scope of this article, there are many things that normal colleges and educational administrative agencies can do to promote continuing education for middle school teachers, such as convening various meetings for teachers under their jurisdiction, organizing training workshops, and holding summer research conferences. This approach has been popular in England for some time, but it is still in its early stages in China. For example, formulate plans for supervisory inspections to improve the teaching effectiveness of teachers, publish educational publications to enhance teachers' knowledge, open correspondence courses or teacher correspondence, so that teachers can have avenues for inquiry, and establish circulating reading groups and demonstration education, so that teachers have something to borrow and something to follow. Compile educational tools and guide practical training programs, so that teachers with research interests can get convenience and guidance in their work. The above are just a few examples, and if they can be implemented in order, they will greatly help teachers' continuing education.

Conclusion

In short, no modern country is unaware of the importance of normal education. Especially after a country has undergone massive destruction, education is the necessary path to reconstruction, and normal education is the most fundamental task of the entire new education. The youth of the future are the masters of national rejuvenation, and normal colleges, which cultivate these masters, must shoulder their most important mission. Currently, the qualifications of most in-service middle school teachers do not meet the requirements, and they have many weaknesses. If they do not pursue continuing education, they cannot continue to bear the important task of training young people. Now, at the time of the establishment of normal colleges across the country, we should take the opportunity to make plans for continuing education. Normal colleges should plan effective measures to make it convenient for in-service middle school teachers to pursue continuing education. In addition, educational administrative agencies and school authorities should also do their best to encourage the implementation of continuing education plans and solve the problems teachers face in their continuing education. With good continuing education for teachers, young people will have good mentors, and the country will have the foundation for revival. If teachers lack sound training, how can they cultivate useful youth for the country? Advanced countries in Europe and America all attach great importance to normal education and pay attention to teacher continuing education, which can be said to be knowing how to engage in fundamental work.

### Hong Kong Public Opinion Opposes: Li Huitang Will Not Come to Shanghai - Claiming It is Ill-Advised to Enter a Dangerous Country - An Unexpected Disappointment for All Shanghai Football Fans

The charity football tournament organized by the Shanghai International Relief Committee and the Refugee Relief Association, in order to attract spectators and raise more funds, specifically decided to invite the "King of Football" Li Huitang to come to Shanghai to participate. Because it concerned a charitable cause, Mr. Li graciously agreed. It was originally scheduled for him to come to Shanghai for the competition during the lunar New Year. However, due to the Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Games in Hong Kong, Mr. Li requested a postponement until around March 12 to come to Shanghai. The Relief Committee and the Association specifically arranged two charity matches, one this Sunday and one next Sunday, so that Mr. Li could come to Shanghai to participate. All Shanghai football fans were eagerly anticipating his arrival and asking about Mr. Li's travel schedule. However, the day before yesterday, a letter from Mr. Li from Hong Kong was suddenly received, stating that he had decided to decline the Shanghai invitation and cancel his trip to Shanghai. The reason was that public opinion in Hong Kong was strongly opposed, and they jointly sent a letter to Mr. Li, stating that it was "ill-advised to enter a dangerous country." Although Mr. Li himself was willing to do what was right, he ultimately canceled his trip to Shanghai due to the opposition from public opinion. Millions of football fans in Shanghai will be extremely disappointed upon hearing this news.

### Western Youth Basketball: Paramount Defeats Little Bears Yesterday - Will Compete with Maihong for the Championship - To Be Held at 9 PM on Friday Evening - All Matches to Be Completed Next Week

In the Western Youth Basketball League, Paramount faced Little Bears yesterday at 9 PM in the Western Youth arena. Before the match, there was also a game between Aurora and Xufang, which resulted in a big win for Xufang with a score of 70 to 25 (27 to 8 in the first half).

Capturing the Little Bears: At the beginning of the game, Cai Yanxiong and Chen Xianglong took a 4-0 lead. Chen Xuechong scored with a shot and a free throw, quickly making it 9-1. Although Carson scored with a long shot, Cai Yanxiong and Chen Xianglong scored consecutively, making it 15-2. In an instant, it became 18-3, further widening the gap. Later, Carson made a long shot and then added a free throw. Ji Fu scored with a shot, narrowing the gap to 10-18, which seemed promising, but it was short-lived. The first half ended with a score of 35-15, with Paramount leading by 20 points. In the second half, the situation was still controlled by Paramount. At one point, the score was 51-21, with the difference being the largest. Later, Paramount brought on their reserve team, but the Little Bears were still defeated. When the whistle blew, the score was 59-24. The Little Bears were captured by Paramount. Although Carson was closely guarded by Chen Xianglong and Lu Zhongen during the match, he still scored 12 points on his own, showing that he is a dangerous player.

### The Japanese Side is Dissatisfied with the Municipal Council's Reply - Will Submit a New Note Again - Originally Scheduled to be Sent Yesterday, But Suddenly Postponed - Japanese Soldiers Deploy Outside the Boundary, Threatening the Bureau

The Municipal Council's reply to the Japanese protest was sent out at 6 PM last Saturday. It was personally handed over to Japanese Consul General Miura by Chairman Fackling. The wording and content were very firm. There was originally a plan to publish the full text yesterday, but the Municipal Council is still unwilling to announce it. However, the general idea is that the various measures taken by the police authorities are effective in maintaining public order, and they are now actively stepping up necessary preventive work to curb the "source of chaos." It also stated that the concession authorities have always made every effort to maintain public order and have never slackened or abandoned their duties. The strength of the police force is also a fact that can be verified and is not something that the Japanese side can interfere with. After receiving this reply, the Japanese side expressed great dissatisfaction and convened another meeting of naval, land, and diplomatic officials on the Izumo flagship to discuss countermeasures and consult with Tokyo. Subsequently, Japanese Consul General Miura received instructions from Tokyo to submit a new note to the Municipal Council. It was originally scheduled to visit Municipal Council Chairman Fackling at 3 PM yesterday (27) to personally hand over the note. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, Fackling, accompanied by McNoughton, Felippe, and President Feixindun, who had been on leave for a long time, as well as several Japanese directors, waited in the council chamber at around 3 PM. However, at 3:15 PM, they suddenly received a phone call from the Japanese consul general, postponing the submission of the note. Fackling and others then left. The reason for the Japanese postponement of the protest is said to be that the wording of the new note still needs to be revised. Therefore, this note may be submitted today (28). It is reported that the Japanese attitude is not to escalate the situation, but they hope that the concession authorities can be responsible for ensuring and effectively eradicating all terrorist elements.

The Japanese Side Sends Troops to Station Outside

The Japanese military headquarters has sent a number of Japanese soldiers to deploy in the Japanese-occupied area in the western suburbs of the city, which is under the jurisdiction of the "Great Dao Municipal Government." The number of people has not been announced. The Japanese side believes that increasing defenses in the western suburbs is a means of threatening the Municipal Council, so that the Municipal Council has no choice but to accept the Japanese demands. It is reported that the Japanese soldiers stationed in the western suburbs are under orders not to conflict with the British forces in the area.

The Japanese Side is Not Satisfied with the Reply

The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that Japanese Consul General Miura is scheduled to meet with Municipal Council Chairman Fackling this afternoon (27th) to further discuss the Japanese translation of the note sent to Fackling on the 22nd of this month and Fackling's reply at the end of the week. Although the wording of Fackling's reply has not been announced, the Japanese-language "Shanghai Daily News" jokingly called the content of the reply "arrogant and cunning." The Japanese authorities are "dissatisfied" and believe that "the reply is tantamount to rejecting the key points of the Japanese demands." The Japanese authorities have decided to take a resolute attitude to deal with the Municipal Council in order to thoroughly resolve the "outstanding issue" and not give an inch. Now there are only two paths: either immediately resort to force, or take "very tough measures" after taking formal routine procedures.

### The Japanese Side Arbitrarily Arrests Passengers on German Ships - The German Consul Submits a Written Protest - Demanding Immediate Release - Foreign Merchants Are Outraged and Ask for Stern Action

The "Feikang" ship of the German company Lu Lin Yanghang in this city was suddenly intercepted by a Japanese warship at 7 AM on the 24th of this month in the waters of Dinghai Island outside the mouth of Wusong while sailing from Shanghai to Wen. Japanese soldiers were ordered to board the ship to conduct inspections, and four Chinese passengers were arrested. Since the incident occurred, Lu Mang Yanghang has believed that this action by the Japanese side clearly harms foreign business operations. Therefore, it reported the information to the German Consulate General in Shanghai, requesting serious negotiations and demanding the immediate release of the arrested passengers. The German Consul made an oral representation to the Japanese side, but the Japanese side claimed that the four people were suspected of being guerrillas and needed to be investigated, so they refused to release them. According to news from Lu Lin Yanghang yesterday, the German Consul has formally submitted a written protest to the Japanese Consul, demanding the speedy release of the arrested passengers and preventing similar incidents from happening in the future. However, as of yesterday afternoon, no response had been received from the Japanese side. According to inquiries from reporters to foreign merchants, various countries' shipping companies believe that the Japanese side's various illegal actions are clearly intended to deliberately exclude foreign shipping and infringe on legitimate business operations. Therefore, their attitude is quite indignant, and it is reported that they will unanimously unite and demand that their respective governments take stern action.

Japanese Newspapers Attack Wantonly

The Shanghai Times reported that the Japanese army, navy, and civil administration authorities have protested to the police departments of the Public Concession and the French Concession regarding the terrorist acts that have occurred in the concessions. The Japanese newspapers have criticized the concession authorities for lacking "sincerity." The Japanese residents north of the Suzhou River have suggested that the Japanese army should handle all matters themselves and appoint a Japanese police chief to hold the highest police power. At the same time, senior officials from the police departments of the two concessions and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce have been closely studying how to effectively curb the activities of terrorist gangs. According to a certain foreigner who has lived in this city for a long time, the Shanghai Times said yesterday that the foreign authorities in Shanghai are quite indignant about the "lack of sincerity" and the fact that the concession is able to curb terrorist acts only with great effort. It is obviously beneficial to them to keep Shanghai quiet and maintain relations with the Japanese side on the basis of working as smoothly as possible.

Cishuda Building Was Also Sealed Off Yesterday

In recent days, in order to prevent terrorist incidents from occurring within the boundary, the police authorities of the Public Concession have specially sealed off the alleys connecting Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, Fuzhou Road, and Guangdong Road for prevention. The F陀 Street at the bottom of Cishuda Building on Nanjing Road connects to Jiujiang Road and was formerly known as Hotel Street. Yesterday, the exit to Nanjing Road was also sealed off.

The Original Text of the Japanese Consul's Letter Was Published

On February 15, the letter from the Japanese Consul General and Commander of the Marine Corps in Shanghai to the Shanghai Municipal Council regarding the security issues during the Lunar New Year was published by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo on February 22. The original text is as follows:

Letter from Consul General Miura to Chairman Franklin of the Shanghai Municipal Council on February 15: Regarding the recent terrorist incidents in the Public Concession, this official raised this issue for your attention during the meeting with you on February 10. However, on February 19, information was received that unstable elements were attempting to carry out terrorist acts. In order to prevent the recurrence of such terrorist acts, the concession authorities should take special measures. This official recalls the appropriate measures taken by the concession authorities for the Memorial Day on August 13 last year and firmly believes that this time it can also prevent problems before they occur. In addition, the memorandum of the Commander of the Special Marine Corps of the Japanese Navy is attached to convey the commander's wishes, as attached.

Memorandum of the Commander of the Special Marine Corps of the Japanese Navy

It goes without saying that all agencies responsible for maintaining public order in Shanghai should do their best to enable residents to live and work in peace. The Commander of the Special Marine Corps of the Japanese Navy deeply regrets that since the end of January, terrorist acts have occurred repeatedly in the Public Concession south of the Suzhou River, and the concession authorities have failed to arrest a single terrorist. Although the terror zone is outside the Japanese defense zone, the Japanese Navy, in its defense mission, cannot be indifferent to the unrest in the aforementioned area within the Public Concession. The Japanese side has now received information that unstable elements are planning to carry out terrorist acts on the evening of February 19. Therefore, they are even more concerned about maintaining peace and order. Recalling that the concession authorities took serious measures to pass the August 13 Memorial Day safely last year, it is even more regrettable that the current state of unrest could not be eliminated. In order to prevent terrorist acts before and after the Lunar New Year, the Commander of the Special Marine Corps of the Japanese Navy believes that it is necessary to work closely with all parties concerned in order to improve the current situation in Shanghai and restore the usual state of peace.

### Japanese Company Mitsui & Co. Buys Up Grain in Various Places - The First Batch of More Than 50,000 Bags Will Be Exported to Japan Soon - Shanghai's Rice Supply Is Sufficient, and Market Prices Have Slightly Dropped

The Japanese side has relied on special violence to search for rice in the rice-producing counties along the Yangtze River in the occupied areas and smuggle it back to the country. The number is quite large. Recently, the grain department of the Japanese company Mitsui & Co. sent personnel to the inland areas to buy rice and load it to Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and other places for transportation. The reporter of the Modern Society has learned the details as follows:

Mitsui Packages for Export

The grain department of the Japanese company Mitsui & Co. in this city sent five Chinese employees to various rice-producing areas in the inland areas to buy rice at the beginning of last week. According to information learned by the reporter of the Modern Society from the rice industry, when the autumn harvest was on the market last year, the Japanese side searched for a large amount of rice and smuggled it to Dadong. In about two months, it was estimated at more than 2 million dan. In February of this year, the Japanese side realized that the direct purchase and transshipment of rice by the North and South Ocean gangs was very profitable. Therefore, the Japanese company Mitsui & Co. took the opportunity to rise up and seize the rights and interests of purchasing, transporting, and transshipping rice, transferring huge amounts of capital to purchase rice in the inland areas and loading it on Japanese ships for sale to Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and other ports. Not only is the entire transportation controlled, but the rice price can also be arbitrarily raised in the sales market. The first batch of more than 50,000 bags can be exported to Japan in a few days.

The Japanese Puppets Even Stipulate Grain Transportation Methods

As for the rice transported from the inland areas to Shanghai, the Japanese puppet "organs" have stipulated several "methods," which are summarized as follows: (1) Before merchants and shops go to the rice-producing areas to purchase, they must obtain a "removal certificate." (2) When the rice is barged to the wharf for loading on ships, the shipping company or transfer company in the place of residence must "guarantee" and prove that the rice is indeed transported to Shanghai for sale; otherwise, loading will be refused. At the same time, the Japanese puppets also oppress merchants and residents and will levy a "landing tax" of 5 jiao per stone of rice from March 1. The rice merchants in each place are doing their best to oppose the illegal increase in taxes.

Shanghai Rice Prices Slightly Dropped Yesterday

According to the report of the rice market in this city, since the market opened on February 24, the daily rice price standard has been the same as when the market closed during the Lunar New Year. It was not until yesterday that it slightly dropped. The highest grade of white japonica rice was 12 yuan and 67 jiao, and the middle and lower grades were between 10 yuan and 45 jiao and 11 yuan and 78 jiao, which was about 2 or 3 jiao lower per dan than after the market opened. In terms of the current rice stock in Shanghai, although the inland supply has decreased, the rice price is not expected to rise sharply.

### Foreign Nationals from Kuling Arrive in Shanghai - Luggage Soaked in Shanghai Mud, Journey Difficult - Japanese Warship Anchored at Night for Fear of Guerrilla Attacks

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," thirty-one foreign nationals and five Chinese "amahs" who evacuated from Kuling arrived in Shanghai on a Japanese warship at nearly noon today. They disembarked at the Osaka Shosen Kaisha wharf. Their luggage was covered in mud, indicating a difficult journey. They left Kuling at 9:00 AM three days ago, accompanied by one British and one American naval officer each.

Heavy rain poured down. They waded through water. At 1:00 PM, they reached the foot of the mountain, and at 3:30 PM, they entered Kiukiang. Soon after, the American river gunboat "Wake" sailed from Kiukiang to Hankow, carrying the American consul and British vice-consul. The British gunboat "Gnat" and a British Yangtze River steamer remain in Kiukiang. Four Germans and four British also stayed in the city. According to a certain foreign national who arrived in Shanghai, fifty adults and four children remain in Kuling. It is unknown

how they will spend their days as the war progresses in that area. The American Children's School and a hotel south of Kuling have been designated as safe zones. After drinking tea at the Japanese Consulate, we boarded the Japanese warship. However, it did not set sail until 10:00 AM on Thursday. It anchored every evening. According to an officer on the ship, this was due to fear of guerrilla attacks and possible river mines. But we did not encounter any accidents, it was said. It is heard that of the eight foreign nationals who remained in Kiukiang, several plan to leave Kiukiang for British concessions.

### Rumor of Japanese Warship Bombarding Zhenhai - Shanghai-Ningbo Sailings as Usual

The Japanese navy has recently been harassing the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang. For example, a few days ago, a Japanese warship bombarded Haimen (Taizhou). Yesterday, a rumor spread in this city that a Japanese warship had bombarded Zhenhai yesterday morning, firing over thirty shells before fleeing. On the Zhenhai side, because the Japanese warship fired indiscriminately, there were no losses. Shanghai-Ningbo ships are sailing as usual. Today, Weirich's "Sinan," Taikoo's "New Peking," set sail for Ningbo on time.

If I don't save refugees, who will?

Saving refugees is like putting out a fire; not a moment can be lost.

### Public Organizations Hope Electricity Prices Won't Rise Again - Letter to Taxpayers' Association Forwarded to Public Works Department - Consider Current Hardships and Cancel Increase

Since the Shanghai Power Company decided to raise prices by another 10% starting March 1st, the 35th District Branch of the First Special District Citizens' Association sent a letter to the general association, requesting them to negotiate for cancellation. It is now learned that the City Association has forwarded a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, requesting them to forward it to the Public Works Department to consider the current difficult times and cancel the increase. Furthermore, the Shanghai Special District Housing Problem Committee, the Rental Dispute Mediation Committee, and other public organizations also believe that during these difficult times, the power company should not repeatedly raise prices. Two price increases within half a year are not only unbearable for users but also provide landlords with an excuse to raise rents for subtenants, repeatedly creating disputes. It is deeply hoped that the authorities of various companies can share the hardship and not implement the increase.

### Japan's Economic Situation - Has Entered a Precarious State - Parties Agree Situation is Severe - Banks Hold Huge Amount of Government Bonds

According to the "Continental Times," in recent weeks, many members of the Japanese Diet from various parties have expressed increasing concern about the current state of Japanese finance. The ominous term "inflation" has been mentioned frequently. The statements of the Diet members are, of course, very cautious, but it is beyond doubt that many of them view the overall situation in Japan as serious, even precarious. The "Tokyo Hochi Shimbun" published a speech given by a member of the Minseito Party in the Diet on February 13. A section of it is quoted below, which can be used to gain insight. The Diet member said, "I believe that the danger of inflation, which everyone is unwilling to see, still lurks today. Therefore, the government must carefully guard against this latent danger and compile a budget that truly coordinates with the overall development. I know that 2.7 billion yen in national bonds still need to be issued this fiscal year. I know that this may be because the government still has surplus funds, and partly because of the lack of goods and raw materials, so it has not been issued immediately. Although the public's absorption of government bonds is said to be smooth, I am only cautiously optimistic about this matter, because I am aware of the huge amount of government bonds held by the Bank of Japan. At present, the Japanese nation has the responsibility to pay interest on government bonds of 5.22 yen per citizen every year. The government should not only deal with the overall situation with temporary stopgap measures."

### Charitable Sales and Donations - Ministry of Finance Encourages - Income Tax and Excess Profits Tax Reductions Approved - Regulations for Auditing Charitable Sales Accounts

In view of the fact that merchants in various regions have successively launched charitable sales and donation campaigns to serve the country, their enthusiasm is highly commendable. For the purpose of encouragement, when levying income tax and excess profits tax on these charitable sales and donations, the Ministry of Finance has specially stipulated the following three auditing methods: (1) If the amount of charitable sales and donations of each business is included in the total annual sales, and the cost of the charitable sales goods is also included in the total annual sales cost, the amount of the charitable sales and donations may be deducted in full. (2) If the amount of charitable sales and donations of each business is not included in the total annual sales, and the cost of the charitable sales goods is also not included in the total annual sales cost, the cost of the charitable sales goods may be deducted in full. (3) If the amount of charitable sales and donations of each business is included in the total annual sales, and the cost of the charitable sales goods has been included in the cost of annual sales, because the amount of charitable sales and donations has been deducted and is not regarded as income, and the cost of the charitable sales goods has been included in the cost of sales as donations, no further deductions will be allowed. The Shanghai Income Tax Office and other offices have all been ordered to follow these procedures.

### Methods for Transporting Prohibited Items to Shanghai - Drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs

After the Ministry of Economic Affairs temporarily approved the transport and sale of local products such as bamboo, wood, paper, eggs, charcoal, and cotton from Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi to the Shanghai Concession, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has implemented certification. Various industries have been rushing to purchase local products from the interior and transport them to Shanghai for adjustment. Local products blocked in Wenzhou, Ningbo, and other places have been inspected and released by the customs. Shipping companies operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou, Shanghai-Ningbo, and Shanghai-Fujian routes have added ships. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has requested experts to jointly draft methods for examining and approving the transport of prohibited items to Shanghai. A decision will be made to announce the implementation immediately after the meeting is passed.

### Zhang Dingfan's Residence on Yuyuan Road Suddenly Sealed Off by Japanese Military Police - Servant Guarding House Expelled

The house at No. 23, Lane 749, Yuyuan Road, was originally the residence of former Shanghai Special Mayor Zhang Dingfan. After the war, all of Zhang's family members lived far away in Guilin, leaving only a servant to guard the house. On the morning of the day before yesterday, several Japanese armed military police suddenly arrived by car and broke into the house, conducting a thorough search. Then, they expelled the servant guarding the house, locked the house, and posted a seal, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. This matter is almost the same as the sealing of the residence of former Minister of Communications Wang Boqun. Gambling dens are everywhere in that area. The Japanese have coveted this house for a long time, intending to turn it into a clubhouse.

### Japanese Manipulate - Kailuan Coal Mines - Large Quantities of White Coal - Transported to Japan

The amount of white coal transported to Japan from the Kailuan Coal Mine in North China this year has exceeded 1,700,000 tons. This year, the Kailuan Coal Mine in North China produced 5,300,000 tons of coal. It is heard that the coal mine's output next year will increase to 6,500,000 tons. Under the manipulation of the Japanese, 2,000,000 tons will be extracted and transported to Japan.

### Chinese Army Jointly Attacks Jiading - Japanese Army Sets Up Artillery to Bombard Various Villages in Suburbs

According to someone from Jiading yesterday, the Chinese army of Deng Jinglie's troops stationed in various districts of Jiading County, about 2,000 people, set out at 6:00 AM on the 25th of this month, led by Deng himself with about 500 troops, in four directions: east, south, west, and north, to jointly attack the county seat. After hearing the news, the Japanese army closed all the city gates and set up machine guns on the city walls to sweep downwards. At that time, the Chinese army disintegrated into small groups and hid in villages near the city without retaliating. At about 11:00 AM, the Japanese army believed that the Chinese army had retreated and opened the south and north gates to conduct a demonstration outside the city. The Chinese army then launched a surprise attack, killing or wounding more than ten Japanese soldiers. The order inside and outside the city was in chaos. Residents were killed or injured by stray bullets or trampling, with four or five casualties. The rest fled into the city and closed the city again, completely severing traffic. Until the next morning, in retaliation, the Japanese army set up small steel cannons on the four gates of the city and indiscriminately bombarded various villages in the suburbs, destroying many houses.

### Zhang Tui'an's Memorial Service Tomorrow

The late Nantong industrialist Zhang Tui'an (察) devoted his life to industry, establishing various industrial companies and yarn factories. The most prominent of these were the Dasheng Textile Company, Dada Shipping Company, and various salt reclamation companies, as well as the Jifu Xing Flour Mill, Guangsheng Oil Mill, and Zisheng Weaving Factory. He was involved in all of them. Therefore, Nantong has the reputation of being a model county, and Tangjiazha was established as a factory area. He devoted his full efforts, together with his younger brother Se'an, to planning local public welfare undertakings, establishing schools, organizing institutions for the deaf, dumb, disabled, and elderly, building roads, and opening parks, from dikes to culverts, benefiting the local area. The whole population praised him. Later, in his old age, he retired to Buddhism. During the barbarian invasion of last March, he lamented the continuous disasters and the destruction of his life's work in one fell swoop. He sought refuge at sea, unable to express his grief, and passed away from illness on the 26th of last month, at the age of eighty-eight. (His passing was previously reported in this newspaper.) He left instructions not to hold a wake or send out obituaries. His son, Jingli, followed his father's instructions and decided not to waste money. However, in memory of his father's great achievements during his lifetime, and the fact that he lived to a ripe old age and was reborn in the Pure Land, now, at the time of the fifth ritual, he consulted with his mother and decided to hold a memorial service at the Fazang Temple on Jialele Road tomorrow (March 1st). It is expected that various circles will come to express their condolences on Jialele Road, and the white horses and plain carriages will be extremely mournful.

### New Asia Hotel - Talk of Reopening

It is heard that the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road, which has been renamed the New Asia-Asia Hotel by the Japanese, will be managed by a Japanese general manager and will reopen on March 1st. A portion of the vacant rooms will be used as offices for the puppet "Renovation Government."

### Farmers Bank Implements - Negotiating Low-Interest Loans for Pawnshops - Fixed Amount from 30,000 to 50,000 Yuan - Extending Redemption Period and Reducing Interest

The pawnshop industry in our country is established widely throughout the country. From major trading ports to remote rural towns, there are pawnshops, which are the only places for ordinary people to get emergency money. It is a pity that most of those who open pawnshops

charge higher interest rates due to the relationship between emergency financing. The redemption period is also short. Although various provinces and cities have orders to crack down on pawnshop interest rates, there is a lack of fundamental methods to supply funds at low interest rates, and the actual effect is minimal. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi specially ordered the Farmers Bank of China to negotiate low-interest loans of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan for pawnshops, and ordered pawnshops to reduce interest rates,

extend the redemption period. This is truly a good policy that benefits the common people. The full text of the ministry's telegram is recorded below for the information of the provincial governments: After investigating the pawnshop industry in our country, it was found that it originated with ordinary people and is promoted throughout the country. It is an excellent institution for regulating social finance. Ordinary people use goods for money. Credit is extremely reliable and procedures are very simple. It is necessary to maintain and develop it. However, in the past, due to

limited funds and capital, interest rates were too high and the time limit was too short. This has resulted in the burden being too heavy for the pledgers, or they are unable to redeem the goods on time, so that the excellent institution has not been able to fully exert its effectiveness. It should be maintained and developed to benefit the common people. From the date of this circular, all pawnshop interest rates throughout the country should be reduced immediately. Taking into account the local financial situation,

fair interest rates should be stipulated. The redemption period should also be appropriately extended and uniformly reported to the local government for approval and implementation. Those who violate the regulations will be cracked down upon. If the pawnshop industry does not have sufficient funds for operation, it will also be allowed to negotiate low-interest loans of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan from the local Farmers Bank of China, so that the pawnshop industry can

operate smoothly and the general public can benefit. In addition to separate telegrams and telegram orders to the Farmers Bank of China and its branches, I specially request that you investigate and order all Xingdang business associations to notify all pawnshops to operate uniformly, and to report back to the Ministry for verification. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi Yu Qianyin,

### Three Japanese Warships Anchored at Xiaoji Mountain - Intercepting Foreign Ships Sailing to Shanghai - But Not Sending Troops to Board Ships for Inspection

According to shipping industry news, the "Sinan" of the American Weirich Company, the "De Zheng" of the Italian Sino-Italian Company, and the "Tang Sai" of the American China Merchants Steam Navigation Company set sail from Ningbo successively on the morning before yesterday. When they sailed to the waters of Xiaoji Mountain at around 4:00 PM, three Japanese warships anchored there used signal flags to stop them from sailing. Then, they used signal flags to question the ships, asking about their nationality, where they came from, where they were going, etc. After the foreign captains of each ship replied with signal flags, they were released, but no personnel were sent to board the ships for inspection.

### British Gunboat "Albatross" - Will Sail to Yangtze River Tomorrow - Replacing HMS "Cricket"

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the British river gunboat "Albatross" will sail from Shanghai to the mouth of the Yangtze River on Wednesday (i.e., tomorrow), replacing the British warship "Cricket." After the British warship "Sea Swallow," anchored in Wuhu, waits for the "Cricket" to sail there to replace it, it will sail to Shanghai for a refit.

### Shanghai Public Halls Celebrate - Li Religion Easter - More Than Two Hundred Representatives Participate - Report on the Repeal of the Prohibition

The day before yesterday (the 26th) was the Li Religion Easter. Representatives from various Li Religion public halls in this city gathered at noon on the day before yesterday at the Puyuan Hall in the French Concession to celebrate the ceremony. A total of over two hundred representatives from various public halls such as Puyuan Hall, Jingshan Hall, Yinxiu Hall, Shiwu Hall, Fushan Hall, and Jishan Hall, including Jin Jiulin, Dai Jinyong, Zheng Xiaolin, Zhou Ruzhang, Liu Jinrong, Pu Yusheng, and Wu Huaqing, were present. The ceremony was presided over by Zhang Yiao, director of the Shanghai office of the National Li Religion General Assembly, who reported on the significance of the Li Religion Easter and expressed the hope that all members would abide by the religious rules and do more beneficial social work.

### Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Announces to Overseas Chinese - Do Not Bring Goods Privately to Vietnam - Customs Inspection of Overseas Chinese Entering the Country is Very Strict - Saigon Consulate's Negotiations Are Very Troublesome

Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Training Order Wilderness Ding Yu No. 196 states: According to a report from the Saigon Consulate, it is found that if Chinese people bring goods when coming to Vietnam, they must report to the customs upon entry and pay taxes according to law. However, some water carriers and ignorant tourists often hide and conceal their goods in order to evade taxes. Once discovered by the customs, fines follow. As a result, the customs authorities are particularly strict with the entry of overseas Chinese. The Consulate has repeatedly negotiated, to no avail, and the fact that goods are privately carried with the intention of evading taxes is obvious. Negotiations are actually difficult to initiate, which affects the travel of legitimate overseas Chinese, which is not trivial. After investigating this matter, the Consulate issued a notice to overseas Chinese in June of the twenty-sixth year, clarifying that tourists should declare privately carried goods to the shipowner for handling, and advised travelers to abide by it. However, recently, it has been reported that there have been incidents of private goods being concealed and fined, and the general water carriers have intensified their efforts and persisted in their evil ways, so that legitimate travelers are very inconvenient when entering the country. In addition to the Consulate's strict investigation of smuggling water carriers and printing and distributing notices to advise overseas Chinese not to be deceived, it is also negotiated with the Guangzhou-Hong Kong and Guangzhou-Shantou money steamer companies to distribute them on their behalf. At the same time, a letter is sent to the commissioner's office in Hong Kong for the verification of cargo manifests, and it is proposed that the Council transfer orders to its subordinate overseas Chinese affairs bureaus to pay close attention during the handling of overseas Chinese exports, earnestly persuade them, and publicize them as necessary, etc. Inquiring into the case, the travel of overseas Chinese abroad is indeed necessary to pay attention to. In addition to separate orders, it is necessary to order the office to pay close attention, earnestly persuade, and publicize it widely.

### Doing Good Is the Greatest Joy - Representatives Gathered in Ningbo to Discuss - Defense Department Finalized Measures for Special Fish Transport Vessels - Submitted to the × Group Army for Approval and Implementation

Since Dinghai banned Shanghai ships from berthing, the sale of fish has been sluggish, which has greatly affected the livelihoods of fishermen. In order to relieve the fishing industry, the County Chamber of Commerce and the Fishermen's Association telegraphed the Ningbo Defense Headquarters and forwarded it to the Headquarters of the × Group Army, requesting the release of special fish transport vessels to transport and sell fish to Shanghai. Later, because the headquarters did not understand the local situation, it was not approved, so fish could not be transported to Shanghai. According to a report from a "Modern News" reporter stationed in Ningbo, Guo, the commander of the Ningbo Defense Headquarters, and Zhang, the deputy commander, listened to the appeals of fishermen and merchants and were concerned about the livelihoods of fishermen. They specially telegraphed and summoned representatives of fishermen and merchants to the headquarters to discuss fish transport measures. The relevant parties who were summoned arrived in Ningbo on the 24th, including Lin Zhihan, secretary of the Dinghai County government, Pan Ruoyu of the Anti-Enemy Association, Huang Junrong of the Fishery Association, Jun Mao-kuang of the Shenjiamen Chamber of Commerce, and Yan Yunrang, inspector of the Fisheries Management Office of the Construction Department. Five people went to the headquarters in the afternoon to meet Commander Guo and Deputy Commander Zhang to state their difficulties and the urgency of hiring boats to transport fish, and suggested several measures for fish transport. After reviewing by Commander Guo, the proposed measures are as follows: The special fish transport vessels should be mainly hired, limited to two ships, only allowed to load fish products for export, and absolutely not allowed to carry passengers or other goods. The remaining measures are omitted. Registration, inspection procedures, cargo import and export inspection, and cargo loading and passenger transport items must be handled in accordance with navigation regulations. The Defense Headquarters has telegraphed the proposed measures to the General Headquarters for instructions and will transfer the instructions to the office after approval.

### Principal and Interest of Rejuvenation Bonds Due - Paid by Three Banks Starting Today - Railway Bond Fund Subsidized by Ministry - Jin Chang Tong Yi Scheduled for Lottery Redemption

Although the Ministry of Finance declared that it would no longer overdraw on various bonds guaranteed by customs duties due to the seizure of customs revenue in the occupied areas, in order to maintain bond credit, the government still advanced funds for the unified bonds that expired at the end of last month. The rejuvenation bonds due today will also be paid as usual. The Railway Construction Bond Fund will be subsidized by the Ministry. The details are recorded below:

Principal and Interest of Rejuvenation Bonds Paid as Usual

The National Debt Fund Management Committee received an order from the Ministry of Finance that the sixth lottery of debt bonds for the 15th Year of the Republic of China Rejuvenation Bonds should be repaid with 1.7 million yuan in principal and 9,945,000 yuan in interest due. It was approved that the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Trust Bureau would pay in soft currency on November 28. It is planned to adopt the Chongqing soft currency payment method. Other places such as Shanghai will issue remittance vouchers to be paid off in six installments, the same as the sixth unified bond method. After receiving the order, the association immediately announced it to the public.

Tongyi Jin Chang Lottery Redemption

After the National Debt Fund Management Committee decided to hold the lottery redemption of domestic government bonds as usual, it was approved that the seventh redemption of the unified bond B type debt bonds would be nine, and the eleventh redemption of the long-term financial bonds would be twenty-five. The lottery will be held at 10:00 AM on March 10th.

In addition, the seventh redemption and interest payment for the five types of unified A, B, C, D, and E bonds, totaling 56,700,850 yuan, is scheduled for payment on July 30.

Railway Bond Fund Subsidized by Ministry of Finance

Yesterday, a "New Voice News Agency" reporter learned from the financial sector that the third redemption of the first issuance of railway construction bonds, totaling 2 million yuan in principal and interest, and the second redemption of the second issuance of debt bonds, totaling 2 million yuan in principal and interest, have already been executed by the National Debt Fund Management Committee through lottery. In accordance with the regulations, payments will be approved starting from February 28. Before there is any surplus profit in the construction of new roads, the Ministry will allocate a subsidy fund to be specially reserved for payment by the bond custody committee. This government bond has not yet entered the market.

Jin Chang Payment Method Has Been Determined

In order to reorganize the suspended banknotes of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Trust Bureau in Hankou, the Ministry of Finance issued long-term financial bonds of the Republic of China for the 17th year, totaling 45 million yuan, with weekly interest of 2%, to be repaid in full by the end of September of the 42nd year, designating the surplus tax revenue as the fund. Since the Ministry of Finance declared that it would no longer overdraw, bondholders have paid close attention to whether the principal and interest of the government bonds will be paid as usual. The Financial Debt Fund Management Committee has scheduled a lottery and set the payment date for March 31. The principal and interest to be repaid is 1,546,875 yuan. According to financial news yesterday, the Ministry of Finance's payment method will be announced soon.

### Zhejiang and Guangdong Postal Remittances - Restored Without Restriction - Remittance Fees Vary by Location - All Have Detailed Regulations

The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau stopped developing Guangdong province after its currency exchange, so has been a few months. Now that the currency exchange in Guangdong province has been restored, the currency exchange in Jinhua, Yongjia, and other counties in eastern Zhejiang will begin today. Without restriction develop currency exchange bills, now the details of the situation are given in the following part:

Restore Currency Exchange: After Guangzhou became a war zone, because of the unstable local situation, and due to traffic obstruction and inconvenient transportation, the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau immediately stopped developing the entire province's currency exchange for the sake of caution. Now that the situation in Guangdong Province is slightly calm, the Bureau has decided to restore currency exchange in all of Guangdong Province in order to facilitate the public's remittance. There are no restrictions on the amount of remittance, and the remittance fee per yuan varies by location and is detailed. The water supplement fee is one cent per yuan, and telegraphic remittance has also been restored.

Unlimited Remittances: Because the local area is peaceful and business is booming in various counties of Zhejiang Province, such as Jinhua, Lishui, Yin County, Yongjia, Yongkang, Jianxi, and Qu County, various industries have sent people to Shanghai to purchase goods, so the remittance business is quite prosperous. The Shanghai Postal Savings and Winery Bureau has decided to provide convenience to all sectors of the community, starting today, there will be no restrictions on remittances to the above counties. However, the remittance fee per yuan will be calculated at 1/1000th, and the water supplement fee will be half a cent per yuan. In the past, Lishui, Yin County, Yongjia, Yongkang, and Jinhua counties were limited to 1,000 yuan, and Lanxi and Qu County were limited to 500 yuan.

### Cotton from the "Balun" Arrives in Shanghai: An Accident Occurs Upon Arrival, Fortunately, U.S. Navy Sailors Provide Assistance, Preventing Significant Losses

The "Gran" (transliteration) steamboat from Balun, carrying 3,941 bales of cotton from Ningbo, arrived in Shanghai around 6 a.m. yesterday. After being moored at the Roosevelt Wharf in the New Kai River, smoke suddenly billowed from the cotton hold near the engine room as they prepared to open the hold for unloading. Realizing an accident had occurred, they immediately reported it to the ship owner. The ship owner quickly ordered flags to be raised, intending to summon fireboats for assistance. However, nearby U.S. Navy ships spotted the smoke and promptly dispatched a group of sailors with chemical extinguishers. Upon boarding the ship, they jumped into the burning hold and sprayed the chemicals while simultaneously using water to extinguish the fire. Within minutes, the fire was put out. It was reported that the fire started because the cotton was damp when loaded in Ningbo, and the hold was close to the furnace room. The damp cotton heated up and spontaneously combusted. Fortunately, the fire was detected early, and the U.S. Navy sailors' effective firefighting prevented major losses. Only about 30 bales were affected, with approximately four or five being completely burned. The remaining cotton was also waterlogged during the firefighting efforts, so unloading was suspended yesterday. A public notary was appointed to inspect the cotton for assessing the damage.

### Wang Simao Completes the Transfer of Duties, Yang Peng Concurrently Serves as President of the Special District Court II; A Dedicated President Will Be Appointed Separately

Wang Simao, the president of the Second Special District Local Court in the French Concession, was dismissed from his position by the Ministry's order last winter. Yang Qi, the chief prosecutor of the Guizhou Higher Court, was appointed to succeed him in Shanghai. Upon receiving the order, Yang came to Shanghai to take over the position. However, the former president, Wang, had not completed the transfer of duties, preventing Yang from taking office. The Ministry then recalled Yang to Chongqing and ordered Wang to transfer the duties to Yang Peng, the president of the High Court Branch No. 3, who would temporarily take over and concurrently serve as the president. Wang was instructed to handle the transfer of duties and compile the record, which took three months. It has now been completed and is scheduled to be officially transferred to Yang Peng, the president of the High Court Branch No. 3, this morning. This has already been reported. It is said that Yang sent staff to the Special District Court II a few days ago to take inventory. He will formally take office today and will work in the Special District Court II in the mornings and in the High Court Branch No. 3 in the afternoons. It is also rumored that the position of president of the Special District Court II will be filled by another individual named You appointed by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, but this awaits confirmation.

### Western Suburbs Guerrilla Squads Active; Three Traitors Displayed Publicly; Under Japanese Command to Spy on Guerrilla Squad Activities; Heads of Men and Women Hung in Front of the Shenxin Textile Mill; Gunfire Resounds Ceaselessly in the Western Suburbs for Days

The valiant soldiers of Yao Youyun's, the commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Detachment of the Loyal Patriotic Salvation Army in Western Shanghai, captured six male and female traitors in the Chenjia Ferry area of the Suzhou River the day before yesterday afternoon. Among them were Gu Dakui from Shandong, a woman named Xu Yue, and Rui Lu, among others. They confessed to being specifically instructed by the Japanese to spy on the movements of guerrilla squads in the western Shanghai area. Commander Yao was greatly angered upon hearing their confession and immediately verified their identities, executed them on the spot, and hung one or two of the corpses in front of the Shenxin Textile Mill in Zhoujia Bridge to serve as a warning to the public. The remaining three people are currently under close investigation. It is said that one of them, surnamed Guan, is the newly appointed town head of Caojiadu by the puppet "City Government."

Startling Actions by Chinese Forces in the Western Suburbs

The English-language newspaper "The China Press" reported that guerrilla forces in the Shanghai area have taken startling new steps. Last night (the 26th) they once again became active, hanging three Chinese heads on a fence along Brenan Road. This location is near Warren Road within the Japanese-controlled zone, quite far from the boundary of the concession defense area. It is said that the guerrillas told the villagers that people easily forget the shooting of traitors. This time, we beheaded three traitors and hung their heads as a warning to others not to work for the Japanese as traitors. It is not known for sure where the three were beheaded, but heavy gunfire has been heard in several places in the suburbs last night and this morning. Every night, the guerrillas attack the Japanese forces, and some gunfire is definitely heard, but this time the gunfire seemed heavier than usual. This morning and yesterday, Japanese naval units were seen appearing along the west side of Hongqiao Road, presumably launching a counterattack against the guerrillas. Villagers in Beixinjing heard the sound of rifles and machine guns not far away during the curfew. Today at dawn, they went to the market east of Warren Road along Brenan Road and suddenly saw three heads, two women and one man, hanging on the fence next to the Shenxin Textile Mill (currently not in operation). It is not far from the Japanese-controlled area of the concession line, and the guerrillas are becoming active again.

Heads of Two Women and One Man Displayed Publicly

On the night before last, in the area beyond the boundary of Western Shanghai, between Brenan Road and Hongqiao Road, near Warren Road and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, some Chinese guerrillas were discovered. They launched a night attack on the Japanese forces in the area. The Japanese forces, flustered, responded hastily, unable to determine the location of the Chinese forces, and rushed back and forth, exhausted. As a result, the gunfire did not cease throughout the night. The villagers nearby all heard it. At dawn, the Chinese guerrillas completed their mission and immediately organized their troops and headed north. Yesterday morning, several villagers suddenly discovered three heads hanging high on the bamboo fence of the Shenxin Textile Mill on Warren Road. It is said that they were the heads of two women and one man. Next to them was a notice from the Chinese guerrilla forces of the Jihuang Temple, stating that the three executed individuals were traitors who harmed the Republic of China, and they were arrested and executed the night before to uphold the law. Soon, the news spread far and wide, and the Japanese and puppet authorities also learned of it, causing great panic. This area is within the Japanese defense zone, and an anti-traitor case actually occurred. This answers the recent accusations that the Shanghai Municipal Council police force is insufficient.

### Two Passenger Cars of the Bank of China Confiscated and Used to Transport Japanese Troops; Returned Only in the Evening

The dormitory for Bank of China staff is located on Avenue des Soeurs (now Jixiang Road) in Western Shanghai. On weekdays, except for weekly holidays, cars are dispatched twice daily in the morning and evening to transport resident staff to the bank for work or to return home after work. Therefore, the bank specifically prepared two large group cars for exclusive use. Yesterday morning around 8:00 a.m., all the resident staff got up as usual, preparing to take the cars to work. Unexpectedly, they discovered that the above-mentioned vehicles, along with the drivers, had disappeared from in front of the dormitory. They immediately called the head office to inquire, but were told that they had not been dispatched. Discussions arose, but no conclusion was reached. The staff then hired their own vehicles to go to work, while also investigating the matter. Such suspicions persisted, and the reason remained unknown all day. It wasn't until yesterday evening that the two group cars and the drivers returned safely. After questioning, the inside story was revealed. It turned out that the two cars had been suddenly confiscated by a certain military headquarters at the end of Avenue des Soeurs yesterday morning. The drivers had no choice but to obey and were first driven to Hongkou Park, and then to the Huishan Wharf in Hongkou. There, they met two or three hundred soldiers who had just landed and were forced to transport all the soldiers in batches to the area beyond the boundary of Avenue des Soeurs in Western Shanghai. After they got off the cars, they dispersed in various places, seemingly to stand guard. They shuttled back and forth for more than twenty trips, and because they were always under surveillance, they could not move freely. They were only released after the transport was completed. However, according to inquiries with relevant authorities, police officers stated that they had not received any report of the above situation.

### Restaurant Robbed Seven Times During Lunch; Victim Reports to Police, One Thief Captured; Stolen Goods Recovered, Handgun and Bullets Confiscated

The home of Zhang Wang's family at No. 8, Lane 242, Zhejiang Road, was invaded by five armed robbers at 9:15 p.m. on the 25th of this month. They ransacked the house, searching through chests and cabinets, and made off with clothing, jewelry, and silver dollars worth approximately 500 yuan. The victim immediately reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station, requesting an investigation. The next day at 1:00 p.m., Zhang Wang was having lunch at the Daya Restaurant at No. 580 Fuzhou Road when she suddenly saw a man also eating, whose face resembled that of the robber who had committed the robbery the night before. She secretly reported this to the guard on duty, who relayed the information to the police station. Chinese Detectives Zhang Keqin and Lu Shouchang rushed to the scene and arrested the man. While passing near the Laoguan Police Station and in front of the New Shanghai Company, the arrested man suddenly threw an object from his pocket onto the roadside. The detectives noticed this, picked it up, and found it to be a gold ring inlaid with three diamonds. They brought it back to the police station together with the suspect. Under questioning, he identified himself as Zhang Jingen, a native of Pudong, 26 years old. In his pocket, they found 45.50 yuan in legal tender and seven pawn tickets. The diamond ring he had thrown away was identified by the victim as one of the items stolen during the robbery. Further investigation by the detectives revealed that Zhang lived at No. 6, Yuanfa Inn, No. 13 Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession. A handgun and six bullets were confiscated from his residence. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi charged him with robbery under Article 330 of the Criminal Law and stated that further investigation into accomplices and other crimes was still needed. He requested that the hearing be postponed for one week. After the victim testified, Judge Xiao Xiefen questioned Zhang briefly and then ordered him to be remanded in custody for a further hearing.

### Shanghai YMCA Branch: The Truth About a Guest Dispute

The resident guest Xu Wengui at the Shanghai YMCA Sichuan Road branch was involved in a rental dispute. The truth has been discovered: this guest has been staying at the YMCA since July 14th of last year and has been in arrears of rent for as long as three months. He is neither a member nor has he provided a guarantor. The YMCA has repeatedly urged him to provide a guarantor, but Xu has turned a deaf ear. The YMCA followed its regulations and gave him a deadline to move out, instructing him to leave immediately. At 9 p.m. the night before, Xu attempted to force his way into the dormitory and could not be stopped. The YMCA had no choice but to call the police, who dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene. After questioning and clarifying the situation, they reprimanded Xu. Xu then requested that the YMCA allow him to stay for one more night, but the YMCA staff, bound by regulations, were unable to agree. The staff on duty at the YMCA gave him a small amount of money and instructed him to find another inn to stay in. This ended the disturbance.

### Dancing Girl Xie Susu Madly in Love with the Son of a Puppet Official; Arrested Together at the Continental Hotel; Police Charge Them with Hindering Family; Both Claim No Physical Relationship

Xie Susu, a 19-year-old woman from Ningbo, lost her father when she was six years old, so she lived with her mother, Xie Chen, at No. 11 Chengji Lane, North Zhejiang Road. When Susu was only fifteen, her mother, due to financial circumstances, had her give up her studies and learn to dance. After mastering the art, she went to various dance halls as a dance partner. Two months ago, she started working as a dance partner at the Xuan Palace dance hall on Avenue Edward VII. Recently, Xie Chen heard rumors that her daughter's behavior was improper, so she ordered her to

Stop Dancing and Stay Home. On the 22nd of this month, she suddenly received a phone call from someone claiming to be Wu Changgen, who instructed Susu to continue dancing at the Xuan Palace. Wu is the head of the dance partners at the Xuan Palace dance hall. That evening, Xie Chen accompanied her daughter to the Xuan Palace and learned that the phone call was not made by Wu Changgen, but by someone impersonating him. She did not allow her daughter to dance, but went to the cashier's room to exchange dance tickets and rest briefly. Unexpectedly, when the music started, Susu claimed to be dancing with her girlfriends as a pretext,

And Disappeared. Xie Chen waited until midnight, but her daughter still had not returned. Suspecting something was amiss, she checked the coat and handbag left behind by her daughter and discovered a half-body nude photograph of a man inside the handbag, with a strong body and handsome appearance. Later, according to Western patrons at the hall, they had seen Susu and a young Shen leave together. Xie learned that the man in the photograph was her daughter's lover, Xiao Shen. As it was already late at night, she

Went Home Disappointed. The next morning, Xie Chen, along with two photographs, one of Xiao Shen (Shen Yuchun, 26 years old, from Changzhou, living in the Xin Family Garden on Xin Zha Road, whose father is the section chief of the puppet Consolidated Tax Bureau) and one of her daughter Susu, went to the Chengdu Road Police Station to report the matter. Chinese Detective Cai Yu and Detectives Cui Chengke and Xu Dewei were assigned to investigate. At 5:00 p.m. on the 24th, they discovered that Shen and others were in a room at No. 518 Continental Hotel on Rue Mgr Favier (now East Nanjing Road), so they secretly went to arrest them. At that time, besides

Shen and Xie, there were six friends of Shen in the room. They were questioned and found to be unrelated, so they were not arrested. Only Shen Yuchun and Xie Susu were brought back to the police station. Under questioning, Shen admitted to having a relationship with Xie, and that it was not the first time. This time, they first booked a room at No. 210 Great Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road and stayed there overnight. The next day, the 23rd, they moved to Room 202 at the Continental Hotel, and on the 24th, they moved to Room 518. Susu also confessed to having a relationship with Shen. The police chief ordered

Shen to be Detained and Xie to be Taken Back by Her Mother. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan detailed the above situation and charged them with hindering family under Article 240, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. According to Xie Chen's complaint and Xie Susu's statement, there was no physical relationship with the defendant. That night, she voluntarily ran away with the defendant because she wanted to marry him, but her mother opposed it. The defendant's friends designed a plan to keep me locked up for a week so that my mother would reconsider

And Approve the Marriage. Her testimony suggests that she still greatly protected the defendant. When questioned, the defendant also stated that there was no physical relationship with Xie, saying that the woman's mother wanted to marry Susu to her nephew as a concubine, but Susu refused, so they went to his place to take temporary refuge. His remaining testimony was evasive, and he hired lawyer Zhang Fukang to defend him. Judge Xiao ruled that the debate in this case was concluded and scheduled the verdict for March 6. The defendant Shen Yuchun was not allowed bail and was remanded to the police station.

### Pig Shop Robbed; One Thief Captured

At 4:30 p.m. on the day before yesterday, eight robbers, armed with a handgun and a Mauser pistol, stormed into the Wan Shen Pig Shop at No. 21, Lane 118, Zhejiang Road. They threatened the staff not to raise an alarm and made off with approximately 1,080 yuan worth of gold, silver, clothing, and jewelry. At that time, the cook of the shop, Xu Amao, took advantage of the robbers' inattention and followed them. When they passed the intersection of Nanjing Road and Rue Mgr Favier, he secretly reported to Chinese Detective Wang Jiaju and Chinese Police Officer No. 1177, who stepped forward and arrested the thief. He was taken back to the Laozha Police Station. Under questioning, he identified himself as Yang Siqing, a native of Anhui (28 years old). At first, Yang vehemently denied it, but after the victim and others identified him as one of the robbers, Yang confessed to participating in the robbery. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process and requested a postponement to allow for investigation, as the case still required further investigation. After Judge Xiao questioned both sides, he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for a further hearing.

### Market Briefs

Hangzhou Yiyuan Ginseng Shop Shanghai Branch: Hangzhou Yiyuan Ginseng Shop, established under the Xue'er River Bridge on Wangxian Bridge in Hangzhou, has a history of over a hundred years. Its genuine and high-quality goods have always been praised by people throughout Zhejiang.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor, According to Mr. Ye Qirong's entrustment, I was very surprised to read in the Shanghai News section of the Shen Bao on February 27th the news that Ye Qirong used special forces to seize store premises to open a business. After investigation, it turns out that Qirong is a legitimate businessman, and the shareholders of the Datong Cigarette Company, which he co-founded, are Sun Yongquan, Chai Zaiyuan, Yao Runtiao, Rong Yuxiang, Rong Zhenyao, and Sun Wenming. There are no foreign shareholders. This time, because of the embezzlement of funds by his widowed aunt, Liu Chen, who co-founded the Dachangcheng Cigarette Company, Qirong, out of family loyalty, assisted in the investigation, which led to resentment from others. They instigated and fabricated false accusations. Once the investigation and interrogation are completed, the truth will be revealed. The report stated that Qirong reported to the Japanese military and relied on his power to bully others, which is untrue. Furthermore, on the 1st of this month, Qirong was sick in bed. Not only did Qirong not have any disputes with Wang Rongcan and others, but he also never went to Hongkou because he did not have a pass. It is believed that the sections reported are based on inaccurate rumors, and you are requested to send a letter of correction on his behalf. Yours sincerely, Attorney Sun Zuji, addressed to the Shanghai News Editorial Department of the Shen Bao.

Commercial News

### Finance Money matters. The higher it goes, the more people buy. Don't sell! Those trading foreign exchange are also doing gold, leading to a new high price of 2,171 yuan.

Yesterday, the cash "roasted red" underground market situation was chaotic. First, it rose sharply, then even more so, with unprecedented new highs emerging one after another. It successively broke through the three barriers of 2,150 and 70 yuan, reaching a peak high of 2,171 yuan. This was mainly because the gold price in Tianjin and Beijing had reached a high of 2,230 yuan in counterfeit currency per tael (ten taels). In addition, if the local gold price were calculated according to the Shanghai black market exchange rate, it should have risen to around 2,190 yuan. As a result, those who speculated in foreign exchange also started to speculate in gold. This immediately made people feel excited, and the buying interest also increased sharply. In particular, the Tianjin gang, securities firms, money exchange shops, and brokers were massively purchasing, hoping to make a large profit by transporting it there. Although there were some gold shops and money exchange shops selling on behalf of local firms to profit, the price increases were quite large, soaring upwards. In the end, due to the excessive rise and the sudden selling off by securities firms, coupled with the eagerness of a certain gold firm to sell on behalf of local firms, the market weakened and fell back down. However, the result was a further increase of 19 yuan. Trading was quite active throughout the day, and the price of jewelry gold in silver shops also increased by 2 yuan, creating an unprecedented high price. The prices of Custom gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to decline.

Roasted red rises another 19 yuan

From the morning, the initial asking price for each tael (ten taels) was 2,143-4 yuan, and buyers countered with 37-8 yuan, resulting in a long period without any trading. It was not until 9:45 that a money exchange shop sold 50 taels each to its peers and the northern gang at an opening price of 2,140 yuan. Although some silver shops sold on behalf of multiple accounts to profit after the opening, the northern gang's buying interest was quite strong, and they continued to push towards higher peaks. A silver shop sold 50 taels to a broker at a price of 40 yuan, then sold another 50 taels to the northern gang at 42 yuan, and then sold 50 taels to a money exchange shop at 44 yuan. Subsequently, another silver shop bought 50 taels from a money exchange shop at 45 yuan. After selling off, the money exchange shop immediately turned around and bought 50 taels from its peers at 46 yuan. Later, the northern gang bought another 50 taels from a money exchange shop at 46.5 yuan. Money exchange shops traded 50 taels among themselves at 47 yuan. Before long, a silver shop sold off again on behalf of multiple accounts to profit, selling 50 taels each to its peers and money exchange shops at a price of 50 yuan. After this, sellers became even scarcer, and the Tianjin gang's desire to purchase remained strong. In addition, a money exchange shop also came to replenish its retail sales, making the rise even more severe. A money exchange shop bought 50 taels from a gold firm at a price that jumped to 60 yuan, and then bought 30 taels from a silver shop at 65 yuan. Subsequently, a broker bought 50 taels from a money exchange shop for the Tianjin gang at 67 yuan, and then bought another 50 taels from the northern gang at the same price. Before long, the northern gang suddenly bought 50 taels from a silver shop at 63 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, the market initially opened as buyers' buying interest remained strong, rising again towards 70. First, a gold firm bought 50 taels from a money exchange shop at 69 yuan. A silver shop bought 50 taels from a money exchange shop at 70 yuan. A money exchange shop bought 50 taels from its peers at 71 yuan, setting an unprecedented new peak. After this, securities firms suddenly started selling off, and the market turned downward. A securities firm sold 50 taels to a money exchange shop at a price of 69 yuan, and then sold another 50 taels to a money exchange shop at 67 yuan. After this, a gold firm also wanted to sell off on behalf of multiple accounts, but buyers were watching and waiting, and the market continued to weaken. A securities firm sold 50 taels to a silver shop at 2,160 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening session. Compared to the previous day, the price had increased by 19 yuan (having risen for seven consecutive days, totaling 104 yuan, with a daily price difference of 31 yuan). It was heard that a certain gold firm still wanted to sell after the closing, but although the asking price was lowered to 56 yuan, it was still difficult to find a buyer, so no trading took place. The current selling price of the gold firm's own gold was 2,165 yuan, and the buying price was 2,150 yuan. The current bidding gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and no trading took place.

Jewelry gold price increased twice

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops initially remained unchanged. At 11:05, due to the tight potential of "roasted red", it also increased by 1 yuan. Then, at 2:30 in the afternoon, because "roasted red" continued to rise, it increased by another 1 yuan. Da Wen Hang Lao Qingyun and other old firms changed to a rise of 219 yuan, and new firms also changed to 217 yuan, with a buying price of 211 yuan, all creating unprecedented peaks since the market began.

Sino-British pure gold dropped slightly

The People's Bank of China's buying price for Chinese cash continued to fall to 1,209 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed Custom gold price remained unchanged, calculated at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 2 li. The Shanghai standard bidding gold price also fell by 7 jiao, calculated at 1,205 yuan and 2 jiao, which was said to be due to the continued reduction of 1 penny per ounce of British pure gold in London on the 25th.

Sudden increase in demand for cash, the discount rate suddenly rose by more than two yuan.

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange suddenly increased because of the increasing number of people who need cash, and the need for cash has increased sharply. The supply side is to blame for raising prices, initially reaching 35 yuan or more per thousand yuan, and then reaching 37 yuan and a half. The final value was 37 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, which was 2 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen higher than last Saturday.

### Although foreign firms settle accounts eagerly, there is absolutely no change in foreign exchange.

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was due to the end of the month for the foreign firms. Therefore, the settlement of accounts of Texaco and British American Tobacco Company was very large. However, foreign banks such as HSBC continued to maintain supply. The foreign telegram also had some supply. In addition, the yarn and flower gangs slightly absorbed the US dollar futures, so the market situation was very mediocre, but the transaction was still strong. Although the foreign firms and foreign banks were closing accounts, the money exchange shops and overseas Chinese were also supplying a lot of supply, so the situation was always unchanged.

At the beginning of the morning, the recent London big strips shrank by 0.0625 again, the forward period remained flat, the New York silver price also remained fixed, the London raw gold shrank by one penny, the exchange rate of British currency against the US currency was 2.1%, the French currency was 3.5%, the Shanghai currency remained unchanged, the US currency rose 2.5% against the British currency, 1.25% against the French currency, and 0.8% against the Shanghai currency. The central government's listed exchange rates remained fixed. The bank's opening selling price in the morning was 8.125% for the British currency and 15.875% for the US currency, which was the same as the afternoon closing price last Saturday. After the opening, the market was quite calm, with only a slight trading in currencies of various countries. When HSBC's listed price was announced to be unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to continue to decrease by 0.25%, calculated at 7.50%, Texaco and British American Tobacco Company suddenly closed each other, but foreign banks were still willing to supply, so the potential was lack of change. Texaco and British American Tobacco Company settled with HSBC at 8.125% for the British currency, and closed with Huabi at 15.875% for the US dollar. Subsequently, the yarn and flower gang absorbed the March US dollar of Huabi and Youli at 15.8125%, so the process was still flat. Near noon, the foreign bank Huayi absorbed the Hong Kong dollar of the money exchange shop at 54.375%, and the situation was also flat. The bank's selling price at noon was the same as the opening price in the morning.

In the later market, Youli first absorbed HSBC's British currency at 8.125%, and then a foreign telegram sold the US dollar to a certain bank at 15.875%. Finally, the foreign firm closed with the overseas Chinese Hong Kong dollar at 54.375%, so the process was not exciting at all. The bank's selling price in the evening was 8.125% for the British currency and 15.875% for the US currency. As a result, the British and US currencies were both without honor or disgrace compared with the afternoon of the previous Saturday, and the Hong Kong dollar also did not rise or fall.

### "Roasted red" is almost completely searched, and the market is now pursuing foreign currencies. The US dollar and pound soared by one yuan.

Last Saturday, British pure gold fell by one penny, the British and US exchange rates rose by 2.5%, and the foreign exchange of British American Tobacco Company, Texaco, and Fire Company was very large. Foreign banks also absorbed a lot of money for the "North China United Reserve Bank." However, there was occasional throwing of the Hong Kong currency, and the banks' supply was very smooth. The market price remained unchanged, and the situation was very stable. The Tianjin gang's absorption of "roasted red" did not slack off, and the gold shops and money exchange shops searched endlessly on behalf of the wealthy. The market price continued to rise sharply. However, the London pure gold has been declining for several days, and the Hong Kong gold price is only equivalent to 2,190 yuan, which has reached the gold transportation point. Private transportation could not be calculated, so there were many sell-offs. It is feared that the rising trend has reached a high level. Trading was brisk throughout the day, and there were many profits. Everyone laughed and was happy. The British and American gold pounds of foreign currencies rose sharply with the sharp rise in gold prices. The wealthy tried their best to search for them and regarded them as supreme treasures. However, gold coins were scarce and the supply was difficult, so they collected all gold tickets, which caused the market price to tend to rise. However, the exchange rate was stable, so the rise was still small. The trading was extremely strong throughout the day, and the trend was firm. The public association's transactions were very rare. Only Xintai sold Changtai 30 pounds of British gold tickets. Yesterday's market price: British gold pounds rose by 7 jiao, British gold tickets rose by 9 fen, US gold pounds rose by 1 yuan, US gold tickets rose by 1 fen and 8 li, Hong Kong tickets rose by 0.5 fen, French franc tickets rose by 7 mao, Singapore tickets rose by 1 fen, Annam tickets rose by 0.5 fen, Canadian tickets rose by 3 fen, Philippine tickets rose by 1 fen, German gold tickets rose by 5 fen, Australian gold tickets rose by 1 jiao. Only Robi tickets, Dutch tickets, Italian gold tickets, and Siamese tickets remained unchanged.

### Securities. The public debt market is stable.

The securities underground market, yesterday's market situation, due to the good environmental news, the market situation is extremely stable. Peaceful news is constantly coming, coupled with the resolution of the Spanish career, the Far East incident can be discussed by the great powers, and the resumption of the exchange is also being actively negotiated. Most people in the market are optimistic. Yesterday, the opening price rose due to retail investors covering short positions and absorbing. The United Union covered short positions, and Tiansheng went long again. The rising trend was very firm. In the middle, No. 38 sold Type B to collect Type C, but failed to receive it. Although Xieda still has a very small number of sell-offs, it has become the end of the strong crossbow. The retail investors absorbed the most, and the future seems very promising. The market price ended up rising by 3.5 jiao to 4.5 jiao. Type D rose by 7 jiao alone because it had not been traded for two days. The total number of transactions was about 500,000 yuan.

Stock trading, 100 shares of Dasheng Third Factory were traded at a price of 37 yuan, and the rest is still under discussion.

### Yarn and Flower. Bullish traders return to raise prices, creating a situation where the opening price falls but the closing price rises.

The yarn market is weakening, and the falling trend is becoming more intense. Since the beginning of the red market, the various gangs have not had any active atmosphere. Therefore, the general floating traders, in view of the poor actual digestion, coupled with the fact that the coastal defense transportation does not temporarily ship cotton cloth and cotton yarn, because the warehouses of Yihua, Taikoo, and other foreign merchants have been filled. There is no room for the goods to be shipped in the next batch. Therefore, the wheels stopped loading and waited for dredging, and then they will be shipped as usual. As a result, the yarns that have been pinched in hand have shown a slight state of anxiety. Therefore, the opening price fell more sharply. The lowest price was 390 yuan, which has fallen below the low price of 391 yuan on February 13 last year. However, the industry, such as so-and-so, and the financial community are all in a bullish position, and the time is still in the peak season of spring sales. When the price falls, they come back to raise the price very hard. Therefore, the daily opening is low and the closing is high. In the afternoon, the Yunfu gang slightly activated and purchased, the people's minds were revitalized, and the price rose by another two or three yuan. The spot price of Shuangma is said to be 396 yuan.

The situation of the existing yarn, the opening in the early morning, due to the bad environment, the actual demand of the guest gangs is still sluggish as before. At the same time, the coastal defense cannot be loaded temporarily, and the floating sellers are particularly eager to sell, and the selling is suddenly strong. The opening price fell by 4.5 yuan, and the price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 390 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 387 yuan. Then, the bulls, in view of such a fall, the situation is too fierce, and they came back to raise the price, and the market price slightly rebounded. The current yarn price of 20-count Shuangma went to 392 yuan again. In the afternoon, the Guanggang office went to Yunnan to buy hundreds of bales, and the people's minds turned to high. The market situation turned from weak to strong. As a result, the total number of transactions throughout the day was 1,515 bales, and the transactions among peers still accounted for more than half. The market price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 1.5 yuan compared with the previous day's price, Shuangdiqiu rose by 1 yuan, Tiannv rose by 2 yuan, and Te Jincheng was flat. 40 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Yantai today, 100 pieces were transported to Tianjin, and 85 pieces were transported to Shantou. Also, 500 pieces of yarn came from Tianjin yesterday. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left.

The Japanese yarn market is still lifeless, because the actual sales are still stagnant. The big players are still in a bullish position. The current yarn price of 20-count Shuiyue is 328 yuan, and the current yarn price of 20-count Lanfeng is 325 yuan. The market price slightly recovered in the afternoon.

### Foreign cotton trading turns active

In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market followed the stock market's strong performance. The cloth trading suddenly turned into a good situation again. The industry is interested in and agrees with Smith's proposal. Washington has been discussing the issue of cotton loans for many days, and the progress is quite smooth. According to general predictions, it may be published next week. As a result, people are extremely excited, and the cotton market feels quite active. The industry has huge transactions. As a result, the cotton market soared by 7-8 pounds. India's forecast rose by one rupee. The Egyptian cotton market was flat. Recently, due to the soaring gold prices, speculators have been buying foreign exchange, so the exchange rate is extending, and the cotton prices converted into legal tender have all risen. The prices of American cotton and Brazilian cotton have risen by 7 jiao per load, the price of Indian cotton has risen by 4 jiao, and the price of Egyptian cotton has also risen by more than 6 jiao.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trading was more active yesterday, but only Xinsheng and Shenxin factories had some transactions. The other factories have not yet started. Everyone expects a large number of transactions to take place next week. Yesterday, Xinsheng Factory ordered 1,000 bales of Indian cotton, including 500 bales of Bairou District, with a factory price of 72 yuan, and 500 bales of Omola, with a factory price of 66.5 yuan. Shenxin Factory entered 100 bales of Bairou District spot goods at a factory price of 69 yuan. Due to the recent sluggish yarn prices, Japanese factories are not enthusiastic about purchasing foreign cotton. Yesterday, only Dakang entered 500 bales of Indian cotton, Gongda entered 500 bales of Indian cotton, and Neiwai Factory entered 500 bales of Indian cotton. The other factories were inactive. The cotton prices yesterday are calculated as follows:

### Since arrivals are scarce, flower prices are difficult to relax.

The native cotton business is still quite good. Factories and firms all have needs, so the market is as stable as ever. The selling price is not weak, but on the contrary, there is a sign of hard rise. The arrival of goods from various places is still without news. Probably the customs in the countryside are still in the midst of entertainment. On the one hand, the road transport is particularly difficult, so the arrival of goods is still lacking. Xinsheng Factory is going to enter 600 pieces of 20-count raw Indian cotton as compensation. Based on this situation, it is speculated that the factories' ordering of foreign cotton is still in full swing, and it is necessary to replenish it. The Yao Hua authorities are inspecting and approving it, and the number of 20,000 to 30,000 bales will soon arrive in Shanghai. The current cotton transaction amount and market price are listed on the left:

### Piece goods. Spring sales have not moved. The selling price of cotton cloth has fallen.

The spring sales of domestic cloth in the stores on this street and the gangs on the nearby roads have not moved. The Sichuan gang bought more than 300 pieces of colored cloth and printed cloth. The mail package was sent out. The Yunnan gang still has the stockpiled goods at the coastal defense, which are waiting to be cleared. The purchase of various goods is temporarily suspended, and the market is quite scattered. However, the situation at the port of eastern Zhejiang is slightly relaxed. The Wenyong gang continues to report and transport the goods that were pre-ordered the year before and the goods that were padded and stored. The Guangdong Shantou gang bought 40 pieces of white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill, and more than 100 boxes of colored cloth, crepe, foreign yarn, bleached cloth, and bleached twill. The Fujian gang bought nearly 100 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. The overseas Singapore and other places bought a good stomach. A total of more than 3,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, and dyed cloth were purchased. The selling price of various goods is flat for spring bleaching, printed flowers, and coarse cloth. The price of Qiahe bleached cloth is reduced by 1 jiao, and the price of colored cloth and colored twill from various factories has fallen slightly by 1 jiao to 2 jiao. The hand goods continue to be sold at a lower price, and the market price varies.

Due to the approach of the end of the month and the silver pressure, the brokers' hand goods in Dongbu Baihuo Fine Cloth Fine Twill are loose and abusive, and people are panic-stricken. The selling price is falling across the board. The spot price has dropped sharply by 2 jiao per piece. The 12-pound Longtou fine cloth is sold at a low price of 11 yuan and 9.5 jiao. The Mujie dyeing factory and various wholesale stores in the later market have purchased a lot, and the transaction of various brands of fine cloth has 7-800 pieces, and the fine twill has more than 200 pieces. The market situation is slightly higher, and the asking price for Longtou fine cloth is 12 yuan. However, the Tianjin gang is as quiet as ever, and the market price is even more difficult to approach. Whether the market price can be organic or not, we must wait until the end of the month and then look at the actual sales. Therefore, those who have more bullish thoughts are currently unwilling to sell loosely.

Today, 115 pieces of cloth are transported to Yantai, 60 pieces are transported to Tianjin, and 350 pieces are transported to Shantou.

### The woolen cloth market is booming

Yesterday, the market for woolen cloth was extremely prosperous. Both buyers and sellers were mostly busy with Yuanbao business, and this year's transactions seemed to be even more prosperous than in previous years. It is a pity that the stock is extremely scarce, and it is regrettable that it is difficult for general brokers to find new colors and it is not easy to obtain large samples.

### Food, the customer sales of flour is unabated, and the wheat is as light as ever.

The flour sales market, the needs of this street are not weak, the old car brand and Fuxin brand and other flours, there are eight or nine thousand bags of transactions per day. The No. 2 flour factory, this street still needs 4.8 yuan, more accommodating for the customer gang's future flour, and the asking price is 4.75 yuan. Yesterday, I heard that Tianjin, Weihai, and Qinhuangdao and other places continued to trade about 30,000 to 40,000 bags of car and ship brands, and 10,000 to 20,000 bags of No. 3 and 4 flour were also opened. The Nanyang gang digested about 10,000 bags. According to flour merchants, the customer gang's appetite is still good, and they all intend to suppress the price to take it, but the factory is now busy with the current bottom is not sufficient for supply, but wants to raise the price, so the transaction is moving but not smooth, and the market is still brewing.

Today, 19,000 bags of flour are transported to Tianjin, 7,000 bags are transported to Fuzhou, and 23,000 bags are transported to Shantou.

There are few arrivals and sales of wheat. In fact, the source of Jingzhen and other places in the Yangtze River is that the production price is too expensive and cannot be allocated. The dealer and the merchant are watching from the sidelines. The previous two days, the arrival of goods was only two or three thousand bags, and the factory's stomach was not opened, because the foreign wheat raw materials are sufficient for application. The need for national wheat is as light as ever, and the total market only opens two or three hundred bags of Jingwu wheat, which is said to be directly sent to the factory, and the price has not changed for the time being.

### Both the Japonica and Indica rice markets return to flat, and the retail price of foreign rice is high.

The source of domestic rice, the river has only arrived at No. 4, and more than 3,000 bags of vehicle-transported buns have arrived. The early morning market in the retail and wholesale market still has aftershocks, and the market color continues to be tight. However, in the evening market, after the hoarders stopped, this street immediately turned slack, and the situation softened suddenly. As a result, the market immediately showed a flat, if the price of thick and thin Japonica rice is lacking in honor or disgrace, Du Yangjian and Buzhiyangjian are also flat, and the supply and demand of the Metag are equal, and they are still guarding the original market.

Yesterday, because the weather was clear, the indica rice market reduced the purchase of rice shops and retailers. The total market only bought more than 1,000 bags from various households in this street, and the market price was immediately suppressed by 5 fen. Nanjing high indica rice returned from 11.5 yuan to 11.45 yuan, and the various grades of Wuhu and other middle and second grades were all flat. However, the inventory of foreign rice in the market has been dry for a long time. The bureau's storage rice has been reduced, and it does not want to create and sell it again. However, the retailer is also living strangely and shouting high because the domestic indica has risen. The retail price of Saigon No. 1 rice in the market has been shouted to 15 yuan, which is half a yuan higher than the price of 14.5 yuan before the big end, but the price of 15 yuan includes the commission fee. The Wuhu Jiyuan rice is attracted by the river's variable Yin Yuan, and the arrival is gradually increasing. The middle and second grades yesterday were trending to flat.

### Miscellaneous grains, even bean depreciation, sesame is hot

Yesterday, the market for Dalian soybeans, because the city's market reported a fall, the cargo owners have reduced prices, and as a result, 10 cars were thrown open, the price was 8 yuan, which was 7 or 8 points lower than last week's market. Other Bengbu beans were sold at the original price, 7.5 yuan, and 1 car was sold. Chongming sand yellow only opened more than 500 bags, and the market situation was not much different, and Pinghu Du beans were sold for 300 bags, the price was 9.5 yuan. Although sesame transactions have not been opened in batches, its retail sales market is still continuous, so under the scarce arrival and deposit, the market price has risen by more than 1 yuan compared to last year. Yesterday, 70 bags of Suqian white sesame were purchased from this street, and foreign merchants have not yet started to purchase soy. Yesterday, this street inquired about 100 bags of Zhangjiakou vegetable, the price was 11.5 yuan, and the market situation was slightly declining.

### Oil cake, bean cake rise suddenly, the oil market's mentality returns to fatigue

The bean cake continues to be highly valued, because the guest cakes such as Changzhou's Xiefeng Wulong cake and Pully's Feizi cake have been reported to be non-existent, the source is not connected, and the factory cake is also only one factory for supply, so the market atmosphere is sharp. Yesterday, 7 or 8,000 pieces were collected from the Xiamen Quanzhou gangs, the price was 3.36 yuan, which was 6 cents higher than last Saturday, and the total trend has not been slightly reduced.

The bean oil was soft because of the continuous drop in the corners, and the mentality in the market returned to soft. A total of more than 800 pieces of various oils were traded, and although the peanut oil price did not move, the market atmosphere was still brewing. 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded.

### Sugar market, domestic grain transactions return to Qing

Yesterday, the sugar market was flat. The association's disk, the 24th Dutch coarse white was slightly soft, and 1-200 bags of foreign warehouse goods were sold at 24.35 yuan, 24.55 yuan for this warehouse goods, and 16.25 yuan for re-export goods. After the price of domestic sugar rose for several days, the industry did not dare to be greedy because the appetite from all parties was not yet too strong, so the market opened again in a quiet manner. The Chao gang only opened a spectrum of 200 bags of ice flower white, the higher one was 23.86 yuan, the second one was 42 jiao, and the Guang gang opened 100 bags of Hainan red, 13.9 yuan. Jian gang Diaogqing has been exchanged, and the market will be available in the near future, and its momentum has a tendency to relax.

### North and South goods, Dalianzi's asking price turns up

The stock of black melon seeds is the thinnest, so the momentum has not been reduced, and it is difficult for Dalianzi to have the color of a certain product, and those who do it are less common, but the trend is also tight. Yesterday, I heard that the price has been increased by 1 yuan, the price is 25 yuan to 26 yuan, and a certain guest's goods that were stored last year are called up to 27.5 yuan, because the goods are inferior, and there is a temporary lack of hands to receive it.

### Seafood, Yantai dried scallops are not sufficient in stock

Wenzhou open ocean market is stable

Yantai dried scallops, the previous market sold for 340 yuan per load, because the source is scarce, its momentum is getting tighter, and in terms of import, it is necessary to buy the foreign exchange first and then handle the goods, so the general industry regards it as a difficult road, resulting in a lack of accumulation. The market has been shouting 370 yuan, and it is expected to be able to become a market in the near future.

Yesterday, a certain store in Wenzhou sold more than 10 loads of Kaiyang, the price of which was 75.5 yuan, which was not much different from the previous market.

### Medicinal materials, Sichuan orange network is expanding upward again

Since the national army withdrew from Sichuan, traffic has been obstructed, the source is difficult, relying on parcel delivery, the quantity has been greatly reduced, the cost is more cumbersome, and the time is delayed, so last year, those who had inventory in the industry were all overjoyed. Check the Sichuan orange network, the highest underground price was 60 yuan per catty, until the end of the winter, it fell to 16 yuan, and recently it was sold for 20 yuan, and it rose by 4 yuan, which is quite hot.

### Paper, tin foil market outlook is bullish

The digestion of tin foil red dishes is very good, and the door market is particularly lively, so yesterday the selling price of each piece in the door market has been increased by 2 points, and the current stock is gradually decreasing, and the source is rare due to the inconvenience of transportation, and a part of the medium-grade goods is even more lacking, so the people in the industry predict that the wholesale price must rise soon.

Yesterday, 36,140 pieces of native paper came from Wenzhou.

### Coal, Yan Qiao has no goods supplied

I had to use No. 2 to make up the number

The rising wind of Yanmei's shavings is getting more and more intense, people's minds are shaken, and the customer sales are booming. The large and small factories all have to be unimpeded every day, so the stock on the market has gradually been sold out. Kai Ping special shavings are called up to 40 yuan, and there are no goods supplied. I had to ask for the next best thing and use No. 2 shavings to make up the number. The price of the same industry dismantling price must also be 34 yuan. Other such as Keelung shavings 36 yuan, Songpu shavings 37 yuan, are also consistent. The continued rise in coal prices in the spring was really unexpected.

### Imports and exports, a large number of Yao flowers are coming from the source

Yao flowers continue to be transported to Shanghai. The De Ping wheel, which came to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday, loaded more than 5,580 pieces of cotton, and the Glenn (transliteration) transported 3,940 pieces, and New Anna transported more than 1,300 pieces of tea and more than 7,000 pieces of native paper. It is heard that the Ender wheel imported tomorrow (1st) will be loaded with a large number of cotton totaling more than 14,440 pieces.

### Miscellaneous: Shanghai Industry and Commerce Trends

Recently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the temporary commercial registration of several Shanghai companies, including Dafu Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Decheng Industrial Cooperative, Tongji Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Huadong Leather Shoe Store, Jingcheng Leather Goods Factory, Jindingzhai Incense Shop, Hengtaili Watch Shop, and Caizhizhai Candy Store.

Companies that received the national goods certificate include Tianyuan Jiuji Factory for their Wei Zhi Eau de Cologne and Tianfu Monosodium Glutamate Factory for their Wei Cha monosodium glutamate.

Newly established companies in Shanghai that have completed registration include New Yihang Unlimited Company and China Steel Pipe Factory Limited. Meihua Automobile Company registered a capital reduction, while Xin Yu Textile Company, Sichuan Commercial Bank, and China Kangyuan Biscuit Factory registered capital increases. Chengfu Trust Company registered a change of address.

### Silk and Tea: Yokohama Silk Soars by Thirty-Eight Yuan; Dry Cocoons Also Command High Prices; Local Printing Shops More Active

Yesterday, the New York market was closed. Yokohama saw extreme price surges again. Spot prices opened at 1,000 yuan in the morning and closed at 1,025 yuan in the afternoon, a sharp increase of 25 yuan. Futures opened at 967 yuan in the morning and closed at 985 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 38 yuan compared to Saturday morning, marking an unprecedented surge. Market prices were also approaching extreme levels, leading to speculation that the surge was related to the Japanese currency issue. The local silk market was extraordinarily enthusiastic. Silk traders, due to the chaotic price increases, adopted a wait-and-see attitude. White silk from factory grades 7 and 8 had already reached 1,750-1,760 yuan. The price of dry cocoons has soared to 400 yuan. However, calculated with 400 catties of white silk reeling, the silk cost has been pulled to 1,680 yuan, plus 60 yuan for reeling labor, the cost of each dan of raw silk has combined to 1,740 yuan.

Yesterday, silk trading was firm and clear, with printing shops being more active. Early grade dried mulberry silk sold for 1,000 yuan, and Qi Li local silk sold for 720 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. Sales of white silk to England, France, and America have not yet started and are far off. Although the sentiment in the user silk market is extremely firm and positive, buyers are hesitant. Conversely, unemployed capital is actively engaged in speculative activities.

### Poverty and Illness

— Fan Shouyuan

The words "poverty and illness" are often used together by people in general; poverty and illness seem to have a close relationship.

Indeed, these two, poverty and illness, do have an inextricable and rapidly multiplying relationship in fact; sometimes they are simply used as a two-in-one special term.

Illness caused by poverty is a very common thing; poverty caused by illness is also a natural consequence. The poor are not only more likely to get sick, but also harder to cure when they are sick: because illness can make the poor even poorer, the lack of medical care often results in the loss of the patient's life, and at the same time, it also cuts off the livelihood of the patient's family. The mutual relationship between poverty and illness is like this.

The so-called poverty refers to economic inadequacy or lack, and illness refers to violating normal physiological health, or abnormal pathology. Handling and treating violations of normal physiological health is medicine. However, medicine for treating diseases cannot be done without money. Therefore, for the rich patients, money is not a problem, and medicine for treating the sick body is not a problem; for the poor, it becomes a problem. What problem? Isn't it obviously an "economic problem"! Without the price of money, you can't get medicine to treat the sick body! This, it seems, is the reason why illness is not a problem for the rich, but a problem for the poor; it seems to be the reason why poverty and illness are so interrelated.

Not only in terms of words do they have such a mutual relationship, but in fact, "poverty and illness" has also become an important issue in social problems.

You see, isn't there a call for "relief of poverty and illness" in society?

Following this, we in the medical community have responses such as "preferential treatment for the poor and sick," "reduction of fees for the poor and sick," and "free treatment for the poor and sick."

However, although the call for relief of poverty and illness is high, the actual benefits to the poor and sick who are relieved are not obvious; although the measures for preferential treatment of the poor and sick are good, the actual benefits obtained by the poor and sick are also very minimal. What is the reason? The reason is that it is difficult to cure illness, and it is even more difficult to relieve poverty. "Poverty" is the real cause of illness for the poor and sick. The difficulty in curing the illness of the poor and sick is already a reality, and the fact that they are prone to relapse after recovery due to poverty is also a fact. Therefore, under the current social organization, "relief of poverty and illness" and "preferential treatment of the poor and sick" are not fundamental solutions to poverty and illness; however, under this economically interlocked current social organization, it is necessary to have these methods, which are not thorough but better than nothing.

Therefore, in the current society, methods such as "relief of poverty and illness" will inevitably continue to be retained, and slogans such as "preferential treatment of the poor and sick" in the medical community will also exist as usual.

Needless to say, the words "poverty and illness" will also continue to be applied forever along with the existence of the current society.

### The Scorched Earth Policy in Epidemiology (Part 2)

— Jiang Zhenxun

However, regarding the epidemic prevention part, it is different. As long as everyone earnestly does it, whether it is a fortified wall or a scorched earth, thorough results can be obtained. Aren't the precedents of various European and American countries ironclad evidence? This is because the hygiene issues that ordinary people should pay attention to are numerous and complicated, and it is inevitable to attend to one thing and lose sight of another. However, in terms of epidemic prevention, although the types of epidemics vary greatly, the causes of epidemics are generally nothing more than germs. All germs have certain common properties. Knowing the common properties of germs makes it not difficult to deal with them appropriately. These common properties can be divided into two points. First, germs enter the human body. Initially, because there is no resistance in the body, it is indeed unavoidable to suffer from it, either getting sick or even dying. However, if you get sick but don't die, then antitoxins are produced in the body, which in turn eliminate the bacteria. Not only does the disease gradually recover, but when the same kind of bacteria comes to invade a second time, you will have something to rely on and not be afraid. Therefore, to avoid germ invasion, it is best to have a mild illness first. Second, the life of germs always depends on the patient's body. If they leave the patient, they will not develop or easily reproduce. Therefore, the root of epidemic transmission lies entirely in already sick patients. If there are no patients with this type of epidemic in the entire environment, then there is nothing to fear from its spread. In short, the problem of epidemic prevention is simpler than general hygiene. We only need to find ways to address those two common properties of germs, and it will not be difficult to achieve the ideal goal. On the one hand, everyone should try to contract a mild illness, so that the body can develop sufficient antitoxins to achieve the effect of a fortified wall; on the other hand, everyone should strive to clear the fields, removing the already sick people, so that they will not infect and harm others. Although the two aspects seem to contradict each other, those who fortify the walls hope to contract the disease, while those who clear the fields are extremely afraid of contracting the disease. Isn't this a big contradiction? In fact, it is not. The above is just theory. If we seriously implement it according to epidemiology, there are proper ways to avoid mutual contradictions. In the following, we might as well go a step further and talk about some general methods of fortified walls and scorched earth that are practical in epidemiology.

If you want to use contracting a mild illness to generate enough antitoxins to achieve the goal of a fortified wall, our ancient Chinese method of variolation has been doing just that. However, although smallpox can be inoculated, other infectious diseases cannot necessarily be inoculated. Moreover, the onset of disease after inoculation is not necessarily mild. Sometimes, lives are sacrificed as a result. Therefore, epidemiology has now abandoned the practice of introducing lively bacteria into the body like ancient variolation, which is completely the same as natural infection. It is appropriate that there are many abuses and great dangers. The smallpox that we now inoculate is modified using cowpox vaccine, the content of which is not the living bacteria of smallpox, but is made using the bacteria of cowpox. Although the resistance produced after inoculation with cowpox vaccine does not last as long as that of ancient variolation, it is actually free from any abuses and there is no need to worry about any unexpected dangers. As for other epidemics, although there are no alternatives to smallpox that can be used with cowpox bacteria, as research has progressed, it is now known that dead bacteria can also be used to trigger the body's reaction and produce antitoxins, with no difference from living bacteria. In this way, cholera bacteria, typhoid bacteria, meningitis bacteria, plague bacteria, diphtheria bacteria, and scarlet fever bacteria can all be inoculated in the same way. Although the method is somewhat different from inoculation, inoculation only requires planting the bacteria within the skin layer, while dead bacteria must be planted under the skin to be effective. Therefore, it is necessary to use the injection method to inject them. However, this injection under the skin is only different in procedure, and the result is the same: it triggers a reaction and produces antitoxins, which can also resist the invasion of living bacteria. From this point of view, the current application of dead bacteria to achieve the goal of a fortified wall does not in any way contradict the work of clearing the fields.

As for the work of clearing the fields, the focus is on removing already sick patients. In epidemiology, very appropriate methods are also stipulated, which is the isolation method currently used worldwide, which is handled by local agencies. On weekdays, pay attention to patients with similar epidemic symptoms at any time. If there is any suspicion, immediately isolate them. Not only the sick person is sent to the isolation hospital for examination and treatment, but also the patient's family and neighbors must be isolated from society. Whether it is people or things, they are not allowed to communicate with outsiders. They must undergo environmental disinfection, and everyone must be vaccinated with cowpox or injected with the appropriate dead bacteria, and wait for the antitoxins to develop before they are allowed to be free. Isn't this a reliable method of clearing the fields? Extrapolating from this, in epidemiology, the two ends of fortified walls and clearing the fields are indeed easier to be more thorough than general hygiene. Unfortunately, in our China, because scientific knowledge has not yet been popularized, everyone regards vaccination and injection as a daunting task. Regarding the isolation method, isolating patients and related people from the world like prisoners is even more frightening, and may even be considered unreasonable, which leads to the spread of epidemics. Recently, hasn't Shanghai been regarded as a smallpox port? If everyone is willing to be vaccinated seriously, and all patients with smallpox are willing to enter the isolation hospital, then the epidemic of smallpox would have been reduced long ago, and the bad reputation of the smallpox port would not have been publicized. Because of this feeling, I am using this journal to announce the truth, hoping that everyone will quickly follow the fortified walls and clearing the fields methods in epidemiology to implement them, and the harvest of the evening sun is not too late.

### Common Knowledge of BCG Vaccination for Tuberculosis Prevention

— Liu Yongchun

This publication has received many letters from readers inquiring about the details of BCG. Here is a summary of the answers:

(1) BCG was invented by French microbiologist Professor Calmette and his colleague Mr. C. Guerin. The two researchers used a bovine tuberculosis bacterium and, after more than 20 years of special cultivation, made it non-pathogenic while preserving its immunizing effect.

(2) The Pasteur Institute in Shanghai is currently manufacturing this vaccine (currently only one type for oral use). It is provided to doctors free of charge in Kunshan, but it is not given to non-doctors.

(3) The Shanghai Guangci Hospital has vaccinated more than 800 infants in the past year, with very good results.

(4) China is not the only place using this bacteria; Mr. Wang Liang in Chongqing has been making and using this vaccine for six or seven years.

(5) The method of oral vaccination with BCG is very simple. Within ten days after the infant's birth, every other day (the third, fifth, and seventh days after birth, or the fourth, sixth, and eighth days are all acceptable), half an hour before morning feeding, mix BCG with warm milk and have the infant drink it. One ampoule each time, for a total of three doses, but this method can only be used for infants within ten days of birth, and it is less effective for older children.

(6) Older children must use the subcutaneous injection method. This injection procedure is more complicated, and sometimes cold abscesses may form after injection, but this type of abscess is not dangerous and often heals without medication.

(7) Vaccination, whether oral or subcutaneous, must be done by a doctor. Before and after vaccination, the vaccinated person must often be isolated, and the doctor uses tuberculin for a skin test (this reaction is positive in those containing tubercle bacillus) to determine the appropriate treatment based on the results of the reaction.

(8) This vaccine has been tested on animals countless times, and more than two million people have been vaccinated. Those who use this vaccine all say that it is harmless and effective.

(9) Important Chinese literature on this vaccine is listed below: How to Vaccinate with Calmette-Guerin Bacillus to Resist Tuberculosis (Chinese Medical Journal, Volume 20, Issue 12); Overview of B.C.G. Vaccination of Infants in Chongqing (Tuberculosis Prevention Monthly, Volume 2, Issue 4); A Glimpse of B.C.G. Vaccination in Sichuan Province (Medical and Pharmaceutical Review, Volume 8, Issue 9); Outline of BCG Vaccination for Tuberculosis Prevention (Aurora Medical Journal, Volume 16); Various Aspects of BCG Anti-Tuberculosis Vaccination in Far Eastern Countries (ibid.); Preliminary Results of the Shanghai BCG Vaccination Infant Trial (Aurora Medical Journal, Volume 24).

### A Shallow Discussion of Rights

— Mao Lie

It is common for people to enjoy rights but not be willing to fulfill obligations. Therefore, when it comes to rights, they must be fought for, and when it comes to obligations, they must be avoided. In their minds, they always think that enjoying rights is a pleasure, and fulfilling obligations is a pain, but they do not know that enjoying rights has its pleasures, and fulfilling obligations has even more rare and supreme pleasures; they do not even know that rights are obligations, and obligations are rights.

The ancients said that doing good is the greatest happiness, and the Western Bible also says that helping people is the greatest happiness. Doing good, including helping people, is what people generally call obligations. Therefore, the fact that doing good is a pleasure has been proven by ancient sages and virtuous men. If you don't believe it, you can try it; if you believe it but don't understand why, you can try it even more. Experience everything personally, and you will understand the truth, so I don't need to waste my words.

Rights are definitely not falling from the sky; obligations will definitely not be fulfilled in vain. The two are mutually causal, and broadly speaking, they are originally two-in-one and one-in-two things. I don't have time to explain them in detail now, so I will first give the example of military service to prove that obligations are also rights.

In the minds of rigid and outdated people, military service is always thought to be a bitter chore. Because it involves life, it is always thought to be more terrible than any other obligation and cannot be compared with rights. However, although the constitutions of most countries now stipulate that military service is an obligation, scholars believe that military service is a right of citizens. Since military service is not considered an obligation but a right, foreigners are not allowed to enjoy it, just as foreigners are not allowed to enjoy the right to own property.

We can also avoid talking about legal principles and only think about the facts. If robbers break into your house to rob your property and bully your family, you have to desperately protect all of this. This is certainly your obligation, but are you willing for others to take your place and fulfill this obligation for you? The small can be used to illustrate the big: a country is also equivalent to a family. You and your children have to serve in the military for the country, which is of course enjoying rights, not fulfilling obligations, because foreigners cannot openly take your place to replace you.

Individuals and the country have already become an integrated whole in modern times, sharing weal and woe. Protecting the country is protecting yourself, which everyone is already familiar with. I am specifically pointing this out because this is our right. In our minds, we must be prepared and practice to enjoy it.

### Children's Corps

— Green Leaf

There are many situations in the guerrilla areas that are enough to inspire people and make them believe that our country's war of resistance can definitely be victorious and that our nation can definitely be revived. Among them, the one that makes the deepest impression is the Children's Corps.

In a certain guerrilla area, most of the children from eight to fifteen years old have joined the "Children's Corps." The "coaches" in charge are sent from the formal guerrilla team. They not only have military knowledge, but also general knowledge. They start with the villages. A larger village or town, or a smaller two or three villages, can usually recruit fifty or sixty children to form a small team. Several small teams are combined into a medium team, and several medium teams are combined into a large team, all under the command of the "Headquarters."

Joining the team is voluntary, not forced. But once you join, you can't leave casually. Each team member has two or three copper coins of "pay" every day, and the team leader has more, from five to ten coins. There are also occasional rewards such as candy and pancakes, if they train well or win a "battle." After joining, if you want to leave halfway, the parents of that child have to compensate for all the "pay" and rewards.

The team members' weapons are wooden guns, wooden sticks, bamboo poles, and any other suitable things. But the team leader and others also have "guns." These guns use copper tubes from bullets, filled with gunpowder, with a small hole underneath to pass the fuse, and are tied to short sticks to make them. However, this thing can only be used as a command or to boost morale, not to fire at people, because it is too easy to seriously injure people if it is too close.

The team members' work is, first, "going to the classroom," second, "going to the training ground," and third, "going to the battlefield."

Some are every night, and some are every other night. All the team members have to gather in the designated square, or field, or graveyard, or wilderness, and the coach gives a speech: reporting on current events, explaining the mission of the Children's Corps, and so on. After the speech, training begins. It is completely military training, not ordinary training in small schools. Of course, they also teach singing. It is best to have moonlight, otherwise they light pine oil to make torches.

The most important thing is to carry out combat. First, the coaches of this team and that team agree in advance on when and where to start the battle. When that day and time arrives, mostly at night, the two teams set off separately. The "assault team" is in front, the main team is behind, and other reconnaissance and ambushes are also available. Therefore, on the one hand, it is a competition of strength, and on the other hand, it is a competition of intelligence.

When the two teams meet, both sides can use the weapons in their hands to attack the "enemy." Of course, it is also common to "fight" without weapons, using fists and toes to twist into a ball. Crying is not allowed when it hurts, and parents are not allowed to speak if clothes are torn, shoes fall off, heads are broken, and blood flows. The team that is "disarmed" or the team that runs away is considered to have lost, and the winning team comes back singing with "spoils of war."

Because there are often small incidents such as bloodshed, there is also a medical team in the team, with the necessary supplies and knowledge.

The children all understand why they have to "fight" like this, and their parents know even more the meaning of "fighting" like this. In a word, it is to prepare to deal with their real enemies. Therefore, since it was launched last autumn, it has been more than half a year now. In various places, "fighting" has been unknown how many times. Some boast that their heads and hands are full of scars, and their clothes are full of holes. They themselves are not afraid, and their parents do not stop them, and there have never been any unpleasant disputes.

During the day, they sometimes have rallies. The teams are arranged very neatly, singing "military songs," and walking in the towns. Some bold ones even marched to places two or three miles away from the city. When they saw their real enemies appear, they threw their "weapons" on the ground and dispersed to play. The enemies saw them and did not know what they were doing, and because they were all children, they had to let them go.

In addition to formal gatherings and intensified training, they also gather several neighboring children at home whenever they are free, and each does individual training, such as wrestling, hitting sandbags, high jump, long jump, etc.

In short, these children, in addition to their normal services in the family or school, are also receiving thorough and active military training. Although they are young now, they will become strong men in the blink of an eye. When they become strong men, because they have received such training since they were young, it is very convenient for them to fight guerrillas or join the regular army. The "little devils" in the Eighth Route Army and the Fourth Route Army can be said to be such children. However, the "little devils" are separated from their families and are completely "little soldiers," while they are at home, preparing to be soldiers in the future, and there are these differences.

This is what I know about a certain town in a certain county in a certain guerrilla area. I don't know what other towns, counties, and areas are like. But I believe that the authorities must have a general plan, and other places are also proceeding in the same way.

Very good, the enemy is making a deep-seated hatred with us, so let us take revenge. The "Children's Corps" is the starting point for taking this revenge.

After reading yesterday's "Departure," I couldn't help but feel sorry for the innocent children. But after reading today's "Children's Corps," we are happy for them again. And the number of "departures" is ultimately small, the number of "Children's Corps" is ultimately large, and the "departure" is not willing, so we are fully optimistic about our future soldiers. ——Editor.

### Flower of Terror

— Ding Ke

### Encouraging People to Do Good

— Jun Pei

Christian pastors are most unwilling to hear people say they are merely encouraging people to do good. They say that encouraging people to do good is just that—encouragement. Whether the person does good or not has nothing to do with the one who encourages them. The one who encourages does their best to encourage and does nothing else. They consider their work to be more than just encouragement; they say they are guiding people to do good, even pulling them to do good.

The people we often see in society who encourage others to do good generally fall into the following three categories:

The first type are monks and Taoists who eat from all directions. To their "encouragement," they add a "soliciting," meaning soliciting donations. Thus, "good" becomes "giving money for merit." No matter how great a sinner or evildoer one is, as long as they listen to their entreaties and donate generously, they can immediately become a spotless lamb. The second type are degenerate sons who indulge in prostitution, gambling, and eating, and who, in their old age, suffer greatly and even beg for a living. They often deeply repent to their children—if they have any—or any younger generation, urging them to do good and not to follow their example, in order to gain people's sympathy. The third type are hooligans and bachelors who have become bosses. In the days when they had only a pair of pants and a rope, they committed all kinds of evil. Once they rise to prominence and open a public stove, a bathhouse, or even engage in some major enterprise, they will encourage people to do good, hinting at their "good deeds being rewarded," and telling people not to have any improper thoughts about their wealth or status, nor to ask for a share of the spoils.

The first type owns nothing themselves and wants to make a living by encouraging others to do good. The second type originally owned something, but now they have lost it all and want to eke out a living by encouraging others to do good. The third type originally owned nothing, but now they have gained a little or a lot and wants to maintain the status quo by encouraging others to do good. In short, encouraging others to do good is about filling one's own belly.

These we will set aside for now. Unexpectedly, new tricks have appeared in the world recently, and there is another kind of encouraging people to do good. If someone is eating a meal, he snatches it away, saying, "This meal is poisonous; let me throw it away for you." But secretly, he swallows the stolen meal. If someone is sleeping soundly in their house, he drives them away, saying, "Robbers are coming; let me guard it for you." But secretly, he steals everything in the house. If someone is interacting with a friend, he says, "This friend is unreliable," and insists on cutting off their relationship, while he himself continues to interact with that friend without end. There are many, many such behaviors, so numerous that they could never be fully described. But he always tells others, "I'm doing this for your own good, to protect you, to keep you safe and happy. I am your best friend."

Initially, it was also only to fill their own bellies that they engaged in these acts of encouraging people to do good. But these actions are far beyond what monks, degenerate sons, and hooligans can do, because the methods used by monks, etc., are still soft, while his are hard. Those who are encouraged by monks are free to ignore them, and the monks can do nothing about it. But those who are encouraged by him are simply overwhelmed with gratitude, not knowing whether to laugh or cry, and feel compelled to listen. He has long since gone beyond the scope of "encouragement" and entered the realm of "pulling." He truly has the "zeal" of a Christian pastor.

However, whether it's monks, degenerate sons, hooligans, or any other type, even if you did listen to them, it could at least be construed as doing good. But listening to those people who are encouraging, and pulling, you to do "good" could only lead to your downfall, to being buried with no place to rest your bones. It is no wonder that those who are "encouraged" do not listen, and those who are "pulled" must resist. He is ultimately not encouraging people to do "good," but is "encouraging" people to do "evil"!

Seeing this situation cannot help but make one sigh: things in the world are becoming more and more strange. However, when monks and others encourage people to do good, there is still some humanity involved, and there can still be room for survival among humans. But this kind of person who encourages people to do evil is simply an unparalleled demon, and sooner or later humanity will have to eradicate them!

### A Bizarre Romance of Two Phoenixes

— Zou Xiao

Tales of Ethnic Novels

"A Bizarre Romance of Two Phoenixes" is a novel with the theme of Zhaojun's marriage to the Xiongnu. There is indeed an abundance of literature on Wang Zhaojun. Taking "Qingzhong Zhi" edited by Hu Danfeng as an example, there are more than four hundred poems praising Wang Zhaojun. In terms of vernacular literature, there is the "Biography of Mingfei." In terms of drama, there are also four Yuan zaju plays: Ma Zhiyuan's "Autumn in the Han Palace," Guan Hanqing's "Crying Zhaojun," Zhang Shiqi's "Zhaojun Departs the Border," and Wu Changling's "Zhaojun Escapes by Moonlight." Unfortunately, all but "Autumn in the Han Palace" have been lost. Ming and Qing chuanqi plays include "The Story of Peacemaking" and "The Story of Qingzhong," as well as Zhou Wenchuan's "The Language of the Pipa." Ming and Qing zaju plays include Chen Yujiao's "Zhaojun Departs the Border" (included in the first collection of Shengming zaju plays is actually "Zhaojun Departs the Border," Zhang Gong's "Wang Zhaojun" mistakenly believed it was "The Story of Peacemaking," see Lingnan Journal, volume 2, issue 2), You Tong's "Lament for the Pipa," and Xue Dan's "Zhaojun's Dream." The latter two are included in "Newly Compiled Zaju Plays," and Zhen Duo discovered the complete collection a few years ago. The various dramas mentioned above have been listed in Zhang Shulin's "Bits and Pieces of the Evolution of the Story of Wang Zhaojun" (Yanjing University Literary Annual, first issue) and Huang Qixiu's "The Evolution of the Story of Wang Zhaojun" (Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University Folklore Weekly, issues 121 and 122). However, the late-emerging chuanqi play "A Romance of Two Phoenixes" seems to have written things that other scholars have not studied. The Yushuangyi Collection has a manuscript copy of this chuanqi. Du Yingtao's "Notes on Manuscript Opera Works in the Yushuangyi Collection" in the Journal of Dramatic Studies says: "A Romance of Two Phoenixes, one volume, undivided, author's name not recorded, depicts the story of Wang Zhaojun, the same as the popular 'A Bizarre Romance of Two Phoenixes' novel. Originally in two volumes, upper and lower, this copy only contains the upper volume, with twenty scenes, ending with Li Ling copying and executing Mao Yanshou's family members, the lower volume is missing." It is likely that this play was written after "A Bizarre Romance of Two Phoenixes."

In terms of novels, it seems that there is only "A Bizarre Romance of Two Phoenixes," which is not recorded in Sun Kaidi's "Catalog of Chinese Popular Novels." It has eighty chapters, and Zhang Shulin believes it was published in the mid-Qing Dynasty, and there is a popular version. This book largely takes from "Autumn in the Han Palace," "The Story of Peacemaking," and "Qingzhong Ji" and slightly alters them.

"For example, 'Autumn in the Han Palace' writes that Zhaojun plays the pipa herself, which Yuan Emperor hears," and thus favors her. The novel changes it to being heard by Empress Lin, and then the empress pleads with Yuan Emperor, adding another layer of twists and turns. A line in "Autumn in the Han Palace" says: "A flaw appears in the autumn waves of her jade-like eyes." The novel says, "A sesame-sized black mole is drawn under the eyes in each portrait."

"The Story of Peacemaking" says that Zhaojun draws her own portrait, which the novel also does. "The Story of Peacemaking" says that palace maid Xiao Shanyin marries in place of Zhaojun, which the novel also does, only the name of the palace maid is different. "The Story of Peacemaking" writes that Zhaojun appears in a dream after her death, asking Yuan Emperor to summon her younger sister Wang Xiuzhen, which the novel also does, only Wang Xiuzhen's name is changed to Sai Zhaojun.

Only the scenes of departing the border and sending Zhaojun remain in "Qingzhong Ji." Recently, Xianni Society's Chuan Ming and Hua Chuanhao have performed it several times, and the dance is very good. It says that the imperial brother Wang Long sends Zhaojun, and the novel also follows this saying, only changing Wang Long to Liu Wenlong (the same name as the protagonist of "Little Uprising").

In this way, "A Bizarre Romance of Two Phoenixes" can be said to be a compilation of legends.

### Causes and Treatments for Post-Marital Kidney Deficiency in Men

Kidney deficiency is the thief of love between couples and the messenger of shortened lifespan.

Once a married man has kidney deficiency, the love between husband and wife is greatly affected. Because husband and wife are the union of sexual relations, a vigorous man marrying a beautiful woman will not live a sweet life. Therefore, the love between husband and wife is strong, giving birth to clever and healthy children, and organizing a happy and joyful family. What a happy thing this is! If a man has kidney deficiency, a disease of dissipated energy, then the life of husband and wife cannot be fulfilled, and their love will inevitably be hit hard. In recent newspapers and magazines, or in conversations after tea and wine, one can often hear and see cases of marital disputes or court divorces because the husband is unable to consummate the marriage, and the wife wastes her youth and cannot bear the sacrifice. In addition, the husband's kidney deficiency is left untreated, causing his body to gradually weaken, and he dies of illness! Leaving orphans and widows behind, according to a statistic and study of youth death made by a physician, there are also alarming numbers! Therefore, the disease of kidney deficiency in married men is indeed a serious problem that modern physicians should pay attention to.

Why do men often have kidney deficiency after marriage? The reasons are mostly due to masturbation and nocturnal emission during the period of spring passion, or the excessive indulgence in sex after marriage. As for excessive use of the brain or work injuries, congenital weakness or imbalance after illness, etc., there are also occasional reasons. In the early stages of this disease, there are usually no obvious abnormalities on the outside. Subsequently, it is often accompanied by neurasthenia and decreased metabolism. Therefore, symptoms such as headache, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, blurred vision, backache, seminal emission, premature ejaculation, impotence, sallow complexion, fear of cold and heat, and mental lethargy follow one after another, and one is trapped in depression and fatigue all day long. The pain of life is difficult to describe!

Regarding the most effective and effective treatment for this disease, according to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, everyone unanimously praises the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadin." This agent is based on factual needs and is made into a medicine by countless world medical experts who have exhausted their lifelong experience, mutual research and experimentation, and is extracted from the bodies of strong animals such as apes and orangutans. The result is the effect of getting rid of disease, prolonging life, and rejuvenating youth. It shocked the world of medicine. The most meritorious person for the invention of this agent is Dr. Stanner, a European physiologist, so this agent is named "Stanner's Gonadin." It is true that this medicine is pure in quality, has the nature of a king's way, and has a positive tonic effect. After taking it, it can produce essence, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood, nourish nerves, and promote metabolism in one day and night. There are no side effects such as irritating the stomach and intestines or stimulating nerves. If you continue to take it, you will definitely be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and you can prolong your life. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Himitol's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the essence gate and prevent leakage, then the effect will be faster. If patients can come to this clinic in person for diagnosis by expert physicians, and then use scientific treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.

Common Disease of Youth

### The Sorrow of Untreated Seminal Emission and the Need for Salvation

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

The most common problem that every man is prone to in his youth is undoubtedly masturbation. This problem of masturbation is very simple and contemptible, but once a young man touches it, it is easy to become a habit. Once the habit is formed, it is like being addicted to smoking. Although one knows the harm, one cannot completely quit. Because one cannot completely quit, the youth gland is destroyed, the essence gate is relaxed, and what follows is seminal emission.

From a health point of view, seminal emission is the most harmful to the brain, sex, and spinal cord nerves, so once a young man suffers from this evil disease, his thinking power will decline sharply. At the same time, there is poor memory, backache, tinnitus, palpitations, night sweats, and other symptoms, and what is especially frightening is that the development function is greatly affected, and the size of the genitals is as small as a child's. In addition, due to the frequent opening and closing of the essence gate, the sphincter muscles of the seminal vesicles are relaxed, resulting in sudden spermatorrhea and leakage of sperm, which can cause symptoms such as impotence and premature ejaculation. Not only do these young people suffer severe blows to their own health and great future, but also in the sexual life between husband and wife, they are often hated by their wives because they cannot fulfill their responsibilities! As a result, they feel guilty in their hearts, are restrained by their wives, and are ashamed and annoyed! The pain is difficult to describe in words!

Regarding the salvation method for this disease, firstly, patients must be pure-hearted and have few desires, avoid bad contact, exercise diligently, and quit bad habits. Before going to bed every night, rub the local area with cold water, pay attention to urination, and take four "Himitol's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the essence gate, and seminal emission can be stopped immediately that night. If there are various symptoms of weakness mentioned above due to frequent leakage, then you should also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadin" at the same time. This agent extracts the gonadal hormones of lions, tigers, orangutans, sea dogs, etc., and blends them with precious mineral and plant substances, which are scientifically monitored and manufactured. Therefore, after taking it, it can produce essence, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and benefit the marrow in one day and night. If you continue to take it and persevere, even extremely weak bodies and extremely vicious seminal emission and spermatorrhea can be completely cured in a short period of time.

Beauty and Health

### How Can Breasts Achieve Health and Beauty

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Healthy and beautiful breasts are a necessary condition for modern women

In front of a woman's chest, having a pair of towering breasts does help to improve a woman's health and beauty, ensure the successful birth of children, and facilitate the feeding of children. Therefore, advocating the development of breasts has unparalleled value. The wheel of the times is moving forward, and the development of women's breasts is an example of the progress of the times. We should unanimously agree and strive to assist them in their success! However, it is difficult to reverse deep-rooted habits. What we see in human nature are mostly women with small breasts and emaciated faces, showing a premature state of aging. Therefore, for women with a little new knowledge, how to make their breasts healthy and beautiful? It has indeed become a widespread and important issue. In our medical judgment, the special development of breasts is a characteristic of female physiology. The development of this physiological characteristic is based on the ovarian function of women. If the ovarian function is sound, then not only will the breasts naturally rise, but the buttocks will also develop, the tone will be gentle and beautiful, the temperament will be gentle and affectionate, and the metabolism will also be vigorous. In the skin, muscles, blood, etc., all parts are filled with new cells, so the skin is white and tender, the muscles are plump, and the blood is full and bright red. Peach blossoms appear on the face, and there is no need for powder, it is already very beautiful, it is difficult to increase age, and youth can be maintained for a long time. The life of husband and wife will be very sweet, giving birth to clever and healthy children, and organizing a happy and beautiful family. What a happy woman this is! However, women who have had chest binding in the past, or who have hidden diseases such as leukorrhea, lack of sensation, or irregular menstruation, must have had their ovarian function damaged, which leads to breast pain and facial decline, hopelessness of childbirth, and a weak love between husband and wife. Her fate must be extremely miserable! The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation for women "Gonadin" to supplement ovarian function and invigorate metabolism. Then the breasts can be raised within a few days, and the above-mentioned hidden diseases can be eliminated. It is indeed the only good gynecological medicine for increasing health and beauty and eliminating diseases.

### What is the Secret to Radically Curing Gonorrhea?

Recently, the claims made by general city doctors on the study of Lin's disease seem to be only one kind. This kind of propaganda focuses on the therapeutic aspect. But to fundamentally solve gonorrhea, it is necessary to fulfill the following three conditions to tell the truth:

(1) The doctor's own knowledge and experience!

(2) The equipment should be thorough and should progress with the times!

(3) The patient should trust a reputable and responsible expert!

Being able to fulfill the above three conditions, then all gonorrhea, do not worry about no solution. The first condition, doctors, if they have rich medical knowledge, and even richer clinical experience, and have new brains, almost no cause of many years of clinical experience and self-satisfaction, otherwise, the more experience, the older the mind, unwilling to absorb new knowledge, and become a laggard in the times. Such doctors are not worthy of respect. The second condition is the equipment aspect. Now, because science is advancing, the equipment for the treatment of gonorrhea should naturally adopt the most advanced medical equipment. In this regard, I have inspected the new equipment of major hospitals in Europe and the United States every year, and have increased the purchase of the latest medical equipment. For example, microscopes, cystoscopes, and other medical equipment must be replaced every year to promote the effectiveness of diagnosis. The third condition, patients should trust and not change doctors who are willing to take responsibility and have a good reputation. Gonorrhea can definitely be cured by following what is said above. This is the secret to radically curing gonorrhea. All those who suffer from acute and chronic Lin, such as prostatitis, cystitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, orchitis, arthritis, etc., in addition to using the latest medical equipment for fine examination and diagnosis, one must have German Filtrin intravenous electrotherapy, German Schick's serum, cold electrotherapy, various types of Jinqi, homemade vaccines, etc., which can be applied according to the symptoms. In as little as two weeks, up to five weeks, about ten out of ten can be cured.

Spring and Autumn

### The Banking Industry in Shanghai

— Investigator

Shanghai is the economic center of the entire nation, therefore its financial industry is more developed than elsewhere. Shanghai's banking industry is thus very prosperous.

Shanghai's banks include those run by foreigners and those run by Chinese. This article is limited to the latter, what is known as "domestic" banks.

The history of domestic banks in Shanghai is not as long as that of the money houses. To date, it's only been about forty-two or forty-three years. By the twenty-third year of Guangxu (1897 AD), many foreign banks had already been established in Shanghai, when Sheng Xuanhuai initiated and founded the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank. Therefore, the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank should be regarded as the pioneer of new-style financial institutions run by Chinese in Shanghai. In the thirty-first year of Guangxu (1905), the Shanghai branch of the Hubu Bank (the predecessor of the Daqing Bank), which was the predecessor of the Bank of China, was established, and Shanghai then saw the emergence of a national bank. Later, the Bank of Sichuan, the Xin Cheng Bank, the Xin Yi Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Siming Bank, and the Bank of Communications, which was established at the request of the Ministry of Posts and Communications, were successively established and branched out, and the domestic banking industry in Shanghai thus flourished. According to statistics, since the founding of the Republic of China, the total number of banks established or branched out in Shanghai has been no less than two hundred. Unfortunately, a large percentage of them inevitably went bankrupt or closed down due to unsound subjective conditions and difficult objective environments. But there are still more than a hundred existing.

The capital of each bank in Shanghai varies, with the largest being over five million and the smallest being fifty thousand. According to banking regulations, a quarter of the paid-up capital is sufficient to establish a bank, so in the past, several banks, after receiving ten or twenty thousand in capital, would make great fanfare and start business. Because of this, the banking industry in Shanghai once encountered a tragic fate. The reason was that some "smart friends" used the bank's signboard to absorb savings at high interest rates, and used the savings to engage in speculative ventures. As a result, they inevitably failed and declared bankruptcy and liquidation. At that time, the reputation of the banking industry was greatly affected; many small depositors even had their hard-earned money, earned through a lifetime of hard work, buried in their reckless behavior, and they regretted greed for high profits and committed suicide. Although those "smart" friends did not intend to commit fraud, the result of their risky behavior was that they succeeded for themselves, but failed "by grinding other people's scalps to make paste," which was ultimately contrary to the ethics of merchants.

Shanghai's banks include national banks, such as the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank. The Bank of China specializes in international remittances, while the Bank of Communications and the Farmers Bank specialize in licensed businesses. There are commercial banks, and the business nature of commercial banks can be divided into: local, commercial, savings, agricultural and industrial, specialized, and other categories.

In the past, Shanghai's commercial banks mostly fell into a state of depression due to errors in their business policies: either due to operating real estate, or due to operating speculation—margin trading, yarn futures, government bonds, etc.—resulting in frozen funds and sluggish business. It was not until the implementation of the legal tender policy that they were able to get government support and escape from their predicament. However, we are not saying that Shanghai's banks have forgotten the work of helping the countryside and supporting industry and commerce. We know that many banks in Shanghai have also made considerable achievements in regulating the rural economy and providing loans for industrial and commercial cooperation.

Except for the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, which are located on the Bund, most of Shanghai's banks are concentrated in the Beijing Road area. The reason for this is, of course, to facilitate business. However, in order to facilitate customers and promote business, many banks have established two branch offices or offices in the city. Four or five years ago, the expansion of branch offices in the city showed a rapid development trend. We do not want to comment on whether this phenomenon is good or bad.

Shanghai's banks also have an industry association. Because its members are financial institutions, it occupies a very important position in Shanghai. It has not only made commendable achievements in its own mission of safeguarding the welfare of the industry, but also has a glorious record in supporting social undertakings; and it has provided a lot of labor in the process of the first phase of the War of Resistance against Japan and national construction, with labor that cannot be ignored. The industry association also has a joint reserve committee, whose mission is similar to that of the Shanghai Money Trade Reserve. It has played a very significant role.

Shanghai's bank employees have two professional organizations: the Banking Association and the Friendship Association. The former's members are senior bank employees, and the latter's members are general bank employees. The former aims to promote the study of banking by the domestic banking community and to cultivate practical talents for the banking industry, so it can also be regarded as one of the financial support organizations; the latter aims to connect feelings and deepen friendship; therefore, they are quite dedicated to the academic cultivation and social activities of the employees themselves.

The treatment of Shanghai's bank employees, although there are also differences in the level of treatment depending on the size of the bank, the profitability of the business, etc., is the best in general commerce. Unfortunately, the flames of the August 13th Incident have also bombarded their stable and preferential lives into a state of depression. Similarly, due to the proximity of the banks' addresses to the war zone and other reasons, in order to avoid unnecessary losses, after August 13th, they moved their locations to the exotic Xiafei Road, living a life of war. Since the withdrawal of the National Army to the west, some have moved back to their old homes, while others are still doing business at the new addresses.

Shanghai has fallen into an isolated island, and the business of each bank, of course, cannot be as free to develop as it was in the past, resulting in a very haggard state. However, the invading demons cannot burn and kill the life of Shanghai's banking industry. On the contrary, because the banking industry in Shanghai cannot expand here, it has rushed to the mainland. There is a vast land there for banking investment and cultivation, and the banking industry has cultivated new sprouts!

### The Fate of Japanese Women

— (Pegasus)

We all know that Japanese women are very affectionate, and they serve their husbands very thoughtfully. However, because the capitalist society of Japan still contains a strong feudal atmosphere, we can say that the affection of Japanese women is precisely their fatal tragedy.

American Hollywood film companies once captured the affection of Japanese women and shot a mournful film called "Madame Butterfly." Those who have seen that film feel a kind of yearning for Japanese women! This is not to say that they want such a woman to take care of them, but rather that if there really is such a woman's love in the world, and if men do not play with women like that American sailor, then what a sweet world it would be!

But this is ultimately an ideal. Precisely because Japanese women are excessively affectionate, Japanese women are even more tragic. Since the War of Resistance against Japan, whenever we see Japanese women writing letters to their husbands who are engaged in the war of aggression in China in the newspapers, we always feel how tragic Japanese women are, no matter how pseudo-patriotic we are.

During the "January 28th" Incident, Japanese women had organized "comfort groups." During this "August 13th" Incident, because of the strict news censorship within Japan, although we have not seen any news about Japanese women, we can imagine that more magnificent facts than the "comfort groups" must be performing a lot in Japan. Not long ago, in Shanghai, two Japanese soldiers committed suicide because their wives were working as prostitutes in Shanghai to "comfort" the soldiers fighting in China!

The fate of Japanese women is so tragic. But there are even more tragic things. For example, the "H" newspaper reported a dispatch from Tokyo, saying: "Recently, the government, due to the large number of deaths of soldiers in China, the number of widows left in the country is increasing, and the issue of pensions has become a major burden on the national economy. Now, in order to reduce this burden, it is planned to send 30,000 widows to Brazil for four months of colonial training, because there are 200,000 Japanese in Brazil, and many of them are unmarried, which can accommodate this group of widows. It is also heard that the Japanese Colonization Ministry is also planning to send a large number of widows to 'Manchukuo.' A request for an annual expenditure of 170,000 yuan was recently submitted at the budget meeting of the Diet to provide for the relocation of widows."

I copied the above news, not to reproach or oppose the widows, but only to feel that such relocation of widows only adds to the tragic fate of Japanese women, which anyone can imagine! Why? Because this kind of relocation contains the meaning of aggression!

Then how can the fate of Japanese women be improved? This is of course for Japanese women to consider themselves, but the day when China's final victory in the War of Resistance against Japan is won will also be the day when Japanese women leave that tragic "relocation" fate!

### Sunshine After the Rain

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 4: Recalling the Past, Happy Heaven Spreads Wonderful Words; Forming New Friendships, Scenic Spots Make Pure Tours

Today, Wu Junsu really replaced Jin Danyu as a guide. Because the two Miss He were visiting Suzhou for the first time. Although Zhu Ai'ren was also a native of Suzhou, she had never paid attention to these things, so she didn't even know much about the famous scenic spots in Suzhou. Therefore, today she had to hold on to Wu Junsu for this reason. Wu Junsu pointed out to the two Miss He along the way: This is here, what scenic spots were left in the past, and when there are the most tourists. He also pointed out to them: This place has been abandoned and disrepaired, and has recently been repaired by the local government. The two Miss He had heard people say when they were abroad: Suzhou is the Venice of the East. Now their car was traveling along the river. They saw all kinds of boats in the river, full of yachts, scattered like stars. And the houses on the shore, the waterside pavilions, the cool pavilions, and the Xianglian study rooms, could all be included in the painting. First, He Shuangyu saw it and couldn't help but read happily: "Jiangnan is really beautiful, no wonder the literati and poets of all ages have sung its praises endlessly." He Liyu said: "People have always said that our Pearl River is gorgeous, but it is obviously a bit vulgar compared to here." Wu Junsu said: "In the past, people said, 'There is heaven above, and Suzhou and Hangzhou below.' Originally, Suzhou and Hangzhou were scenic areas. In fact, China is the most beautiful country, and there are good scenery everywhere, not just Suzhou and Hangzhou. It's not that we Chinese are selfish, but everyone from Europe and the United States who comes to China to travel says so. Because China is such a good place, people come to covet it. Those places that have been seized have been trampled on by them as much as possible. The most ridiculous thing is that during the war, we initially had many places that were occupied. When we recovered them, some large houses had all turned into small houses, with one room to the east and one room to the west, making it impossible to distinguish the direction. They also added many wooden houses, which in China are used by gatekeepers or police officers on duty." Everyone laughed when he said this. Wu Junsu also said: "There is one thing that I think the local authorities in Suzhou and Hangzhou have done reasonably well. That is, advertisements are not allowed to invade the scenic spots. In the past, those commercial advertisements were really tyrannical and terrible. They always chose the best scenic spots to erect an advertising board. And most of those advertising boards were for selling medicine, and they were all strangely shaped, ugly, and unbearable. It was really a scene-destroying thing. I hated it the most when I saw it. Now it's good, 'Advertising boards are not allowed to be erected randomly in scenic spots.'" It is precisely:

Heaven adds beauty to lakes and mountains, people are all obsessed with food and clothing (48)

### Peach and Plum Compete for Spring

— Ruhua

Woman Against Woman

A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production, showing at the Nanjing Grand Theater

After Herbert Marshall and Dina Powell co-starred in "Little Women," he partnered with Claudette Colbert in "Bluebeard's Eighth Wife," which opened at the Cathay Theater during the Spring Festival. Although Herbert Marshall is not the most handsome male star in Hollywood, his appearance and acting skills are well-suited to the roles he plays. In "Peach and Plum Compete for Spring," he plays lawyer Steve, who, after divorcing his willful and selfish wife Christine, meets Maris in Washington. Because they are like-minded, they get married. However, Steve's fellow villagers see her as the culprit who destroyed Steve's family, often making Maris embarrassed. At the same time, Steve has a lovely daughter, Ellen, who is raised by Christine after the divorce. At a banquet, Christine and Maris have a falling out. Christine angrily wants to take Ellen away to New York. Steve, not wanting his daughter to leave, pleads with Christine to take Ellen to stay at a lakeside cottage. Christine thinks that with the relationship between her daughter, she can rekindle her old love with Steve. She pretends that Ellen is ill and urges Steve to go. But when Steve arrives, Ellen is not sick, and Christine is dancing. Steve suddenly realizes and enjoys family life with Maris.

The union of men and women is naturally built on the foundation of love. Since Steve and Christine have cracks in their relationship, it is natural for them to divorce. However, because of the nature of father and daughter, Steve's spirit is still threatened by pain, which is a very difficult problem to solve. As in "Peach and Plum Compete for Spring," it is too ideal for Christine and Maris to become close friends. Herbert Marshall plays Steve, who is torn between the love of husband and wife and the love of flesh and blood, very calmly.

Director Robert Sinclair is a stage director. "Peach and Plum Compete for Spring" is still his trial work. Here, although he has not turned "Peach and Plum Compete for Spring" into a stage play, he cannot describe the emotional changes between Steve, Christine, and Maris more deeply. Therefore, what "Peach and Plum Compete for Spring" makes us feel is just a very superficial story. This is his failure, and at the same time, it weakens the profound and touching power of "Peach and Plum Compete for Spring."

Virginia Bruce as Maris and Marilla Easters as Christine also cannot fully develop their acting skills because of the director's light-hearted style.

### Prospects for the Future of Traditional Opera

— Yutang

Looking at the aftermath of the opening of the Great War of Resistance, both the front and the rear are using films and dramas as propaganda tools for the War of Resistance. Except for a very small number of abnormal areas, there are not many people who appreciate and sell traditional opera. It can be predicted that after the victory of the War of Resistance, during the period of reconstruction and construction, the decline of the status of traditional opera will be even more predictable. Don't think that just because the large and small Peking opera venues on the isolated island are full every day, traditional opera is full of vitality and still has a large audience. Let me tell you that this is just an abnormal development, a final burst of light when a patient is critically ill.

Many enthusiastic lovers of traditional opera, witnessing the rise and fall of traditional opera, can't help but feel worried. Therefore, they put forward the slogan of reforming traditional opera. The so-called Four Great Dan Actors, who have sung traditional opera for half their lives, are tired of it and blame the words of the traditional opera for being vulgar and incomprehensible. In this way, there are poets and writers, old remnants and young masters, who write scripts with sad and stubborn verses and ornate lyrics to label them as new operas. However, the consciousness of the scripts is not very advanced, and the performance techniques are not more advanced than traditional scripts. Just saying that the sword of Farewell My Concubine and the hoe of Burying Flowers have no artistic value at all, and are far inferior to the body movements such as Drunkenly Slaying the Tiger. And the lyrics written by famous writers are certainly beautiful and readable when written on paper, but when sung on stage, the audience is still confused. On the contrary, the words of the traditional opera can be understood by women and children. If this is considered reforming traditional opera, it is undoubtedly a failure. Li Shizeng and Jiao Juying, seeing that Fu Liancheng had made a fortune, and also disliked the way he was doing it, established a drama school. It is too early to teach ten-year-old children drama theory; teaching singing still requires asking old actors, so the talents created are not stronger than Fu Liancheng, and they can only quickly invite already famous Dan actors to teach Emei Sword and Spider Cave. This is not considered a reform either. Wang Bosheng worked hard for a while on "New Opera." He loved traditional opera and also knew a little about Western drama, so he wanted to extract some fertilizer from traditional opera to irrigate his imagined new opera, which would appear in a new form. He ran drama schools in Shandong for a long time, but there were no achievements to show us. However, when I think of this gentleman's performance of the 126-sentence Ascent to Heaven, I can foresee that his so-called new opera, in addition to tearing the face of traditional opera to pieces and selling a wild man's head, will never have a satisfactory harvest. Taking advantage of the curiosity of British and American people about China, Xiong Shiyi's Wang Baochuan, who wore Chinese costumes and spoke foreign languages, really made a splash (we have many similar scripts in your country). Then, when people got tired of Wang Baochuan, he changed to Cui Yingying. When foreigners got tired of it, Xiong Shiyi's pocket was also full. Traditional opera was also ridiculed enough by him, but he did not say that he was reforming traditional opera. (Two)

### Chatting About Drama at Qianqian Studio: Discussing Visiting Mother and Returning to the Order (Part 2)

— Zhang Xiaocen

Before Lao Tan, Zhang Erkui was the best at singing Visiting Mother, and Yang Yuelou was also famous. In addition to Xu Yintang and Zong Kuisun's two schools of famous amateurs En Yuzhi (who was as famous as Hongdouguan's master Bao Dan Ting, etc.) and the Kui school, Yu Sansheng was also highly praised and stood alongside the Tan school. Wang Guifen and Sun Juxian, who also performed this play, were also rivals of the Tan school, but they were no match for Lao Tan. After Wang, Wang Fengxiang's singing voice had not declined before the eighth year of the Republic, and this play could also move people. After Lao Tan's death for several years, Yu Shuyan rose up, and Shuyan was not without merit in making the Tan tune immortal. From then on, there is no need to discuss it. The following describes the perfect roles in Lao Tan's era: Tan Xinpei (Fourth Brother), Wang Yaoqing (Princess), Chen Delin (Empress Dowager Xiao), Li Shunting (Sixth Brother), Shi Xiaofu (Fourth Madam), Xie Baoyun (She Taijun), Zhu Suyun (Zong Bao). After Lao Tan's death, the famous actors in the old capital who sang Visiting Mother were Wang Fengqing and Yu Shuyan, whose supporting roles were Chen Delin (Empress Dowager Xiao), Ji Yunfu (She Taijun), Mei Lanfang (Princess), Wang Qinong (Fourth Madam), Jiang Miaoxiang (Zong Bao), and Zhang Chunyan (Sixth Brother). As for the role of Empress Dowager Xiao, apart from Delin, Li Baoqin was also good, and Wu Caixia, Zhao Zhixiang, and Furongcao were still acceptable. As for the role of She Taijun, apart from Xie Baoyun and Long Yunfu, it can be said that there were no successors. Mei Lanfang exclusively dominated the role of Princess, and Yanqiu and Xiaoyun were overshadowed. Apart from Li Shunting, Jia Honglin was the best in the role of Sixth Brother. Wu Caixia and Zhao Zhixiang were also quite competent in the role of Fourth Madam. Among the female actors, Meng Xiaodong and Xue Yanqin can be called two difficulties.

In addition, Ma Lianliang became more and more popular in Shanghai, and his life was regretful that he could not sing Visiting Mother with Mei Lanfang. In a grand performance in Shanghai one year, Suliang came to Shanghai from Ping, determined to sing Visiting Mother. As a result, Lanfang still sang with Tan Fuying, and Lianliang had no choice. Tan Fuying's reputation in Shanghai has always been below that of Lianliang. However, in Zhang Xiaolin's performance, he sang Visiting Mother with Lianliang, and Fuying was greatly appreciated by the audience. From then on, Fuying's reputation greatly increased, and Lianliang did not dare to perform this play much after that. However, recently, Fuying could not use the ga tune when singing "Calling Xiao Fan" at the Golden Theater, which was also dissatisfied by the audience. To be fair, it is not a disgrace even if he cannot use the ga tune. Also, Qilin Tong in Shanghai has also sung Visiting Mother several times. It is not known whether he sang it alone or with Gao Baisui. It is also unknown whether Zhou Xinfang has another style for this play.

### Another Story About the Arrest of Xin Yanqiu

— Li Ren

Trapped by Miu's Wife for Lewdness, Guan Weilin Became a Scapegoat

This magazine has published the process of Guan Zhongxin Yanqiu's arrest twice, which has attracted much attention from readers. Someone asked me whether the new actor is alive or dead? Then I dare to assert that she is not dead. According to the Reuters dispatch from Beijing on the 20th, the new actor "died of starvation in prison." When this news came out, everyone felt abrupt, so this magazine republished the details of her arrest on the 23rd, saying that she was injured and released on bail and had been admitted to the Xiehe Hospital for treatment. I think she won't die, and since she has been released on bail, she won't die in prison. This is obvious. As for the inhuman physical punishment suffered by the new actor after being arrested, I think it is completely unjust. Of course, there are also quite complicated reasons in it. After reading the short essay below, you can understand a little bit.

I have seen reports about the death of the famous actor Xin Yanqiu one after another, and the opinions are divided. Even this magazine has two different records. Recently, I received a letter from a friend living in Ping, who also mentioned this matter. The facts he described are slightly different. I will record it here for the time being. How the truth is, still needs to be proved by the facts.

According to the letter, "The puppet organizations in Beijing are now very popular in supporting actors. Miu Bin is the one who supports Xin Yanqiu. Every time the new actor takes the stage, almost all of his tickets are sold by Miu. Miu's wife is famous for being fierce, so she often wants to find ways to harm her. One day, Xin Yanqiu took the stage at the Jixiang Theater. Miu Bin booked a box in advance, but temporarily this box was suddenly occupied by a Guan (or Guan Zheng Lin in the Reuters report - the author notes). Miuni was able to escape death because of this. On that day, someone was planning to assassinate Bin. Although the box he booked had been changed, the slip of paper with the words 'Minister Miu' had not been torn off. The assassin did not realize it for a while and mistakenly regarded Guan as a thread, and with a bang, Guan became a scapegoat. Afterwards, Miu's wife secretly told the Japanese that Xin Yanqiu was secretly instructed by the Communist Party to make a trap in an attempt to kill Miu. As a result, the new actor was recognized and imprisoned. As of the time of sending the letter, there was no other development."

### Little Wang Huchen: Afraid to Leave the Wharf

— Bu Zhi

Little Wang Huchen, aka Mu Lan Jun, is considered a very interesting character by everyone.

Last month, he accepted an invitation from a certain theater in Nanjing, intending to perform there. The terms were agreed upon, with a monthly salary of seven hundred yuan. So, he packed his bags, got a travel permit, and after a farewell dinner with many friends, he happily boarded a long-distance bus. Who knew that halfway there, the bus broke down for some reason, and he injured both legs. Greatly alarmed, he returned to Shanghai, thoroughly displeased. Upon arriving in Shanghai, he cited this incident as a reason to cancel the contract with the Nanjing theater.

Now, his leg injuries have healed, and he is celebrating the New Year as happily as anyone else. However, if anyone asks him about his dangerous experience, he will vividly imitate the situation for them. He describes how he prepared to leave; he describes the type of bus he rode; he describes how interesting it was sitting on the bus; he describes what he saw before the accident; he describes the panic during the accident; he describes the extent of the bus damage; he describes where he injured his legs; he describes how he decided to return to Shanghai; he describes how he was treated after arriving in Shanghai. He tells every detail, patiently, explaining everything meticulously. In the end, he concludes with a "dangerous, so dangerous," which is:

"From now on, I dare not leave the wharf again. Even if Nanjing offered me ten times the seven hundred, I wouldn't risk it. Life is precious. It's not worth making a mess of things. It's better to live peacefully in Shanghai and make a living!"

Followed by a burst of hearty laughter.

His attitude is quite amusing.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden of the Old Capital (116)

— Xu Muyun

The ancients often said, "Wrath makes the hair stand on end." According to my humble opinion, since the predecessors had such a saying, there must be a reason for it. When I am extremely angry, although I can't actually make my high-topped turban fly off, I can at least manage to keep it firmly in place. This will earn me applause from the audience, firstly, it won't disappoint the experienced theatergoers, and secondly, it won't violate the industry regulations I mentioned above."

Everyone who heard Master Tan's lengthy explanation was very satisfied, thinking that he was in a good mood today, so some people eagerly asked him, "How do you practice this skill? Can you reveal it so that we can all learn it?" Old Tan just smiled, immediately interrupting them, saying, "I'm tired today, let's talk about it another day." Among these people, there were one or two who knew his habit of keeping secrets, so they stopped the others from asking. Generally, experts in any field are like this: they would rather take their skills to the grave than teach the secrets they have painstakingly researched to others; especially someone like Old Tan, who doesn't even pass them on to his sons-in-law, how could he be willing to tell outsiders? In the past, the old thirteenth Dan, Hou Junshan, when he sang "Drunken Concubine" and performed the "Lying Fish" posture, his headdress would never fall off. For others, as long as the head and body formed a straight line, the imperial concubine's phoenix crown would fall to the ground. Therefore, ordinary people performing this would often keep their bodies close to the ground while desperately lifting their heads to prevent the headdress from falling off too soon. Later, Old Hou's apprentice had a secret relationship with his teacher's wife, and she repeatedly begged her teacher to ask him to explain it clearly. Old Hou, pressed by his beloved concubine, finally told her, "He has already learned seven or eight tenths of my skills. In the past, because I still had to make a living in this field, I had to keep a few tricks up my sleeve and hide this unique skill. Now that I'm so old, I don't want to work in the theater anymore, so it doesn't matter if I reveal it."
