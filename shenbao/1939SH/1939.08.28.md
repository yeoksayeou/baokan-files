### Attitudes of England and France Towards Germany: Insisting on Equal Status and Free Negotiations; Ambassador Henderson Returns to Berlin Today; British Government Carefully Discussing the Reply

London, after this afternoon's cabinet meeting, a communiqué was issued stating that the cabinet will continue to meet at noon tomorrow. It is widely expected that Ambassador Henderson will return to Berlin tomorrow with the British government's reply to Hitler. The contents of the document from Hitler to the British government, as reported by various newspapers, have not been officially authorized and are not accurate. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

London, Sir Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, returned here today with proposals from the German Führer Hitler. The authorities have submitted them to the cabinet for discussion. According to what Polish sources here know, the demands of Führer Hitler are: Firstly, to recover Danzig; Secondly, to build a military road through the Polish Corridor; and he insists that Britain first abandon the guarantees it has provided to Poland, after which Germany can directly negotiate with Poland to redraw the German-Polish border. According to well-informed sources, Führer Hitler strongly asserted during his meeting with Ambassador Henderson yesterday that Germans within Poland are being mistreated and that Poland's attitude is rigid because of the guarantees provided by Western European countries. Germany is dissatisfied with all of this, and the current situation cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. The solution is for Germany to recover the city of Danzig and build a "military corridor" through the Polish Corridor before negotiations with Poland can begin. However, if incidents occur during the negotiations, Germany must still resort to military action against Poland. Furthermore, Germany is willing to maintain friendly relations with Britain. Although the colonial issue between the two countries remains unresolved, it may be resolved in a few years. Once the Polish issue is resolved, Germany is willing to immediately negotiate disarmament matters. This news has been confirmed by government officials, who said that Germany is still using force as a threat. Under these circumstances, Britain must still take a firm stance. This afternoon, Foreign Secretary Halifax made a sincere statement to Polish Ambassador Raczynski, and the two agreed that the Polish government should do its utmost to avoid all incidents so that Germany would have no excuse to use the alleged mistreatment of Germans. Regarding this matter, the British government's reply to Führer Hitler will also strongly emphasize the Polish government's sincerity. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

London, regarding the proposals made by Führer Hitler, the British government's reply will be handed to Ambassador Henderson tomorrow to take back to Berlin. Government officials here anticipate that the reply will clarify three points: (1) The guarantee that Britain has provided to Poland is fully valid; (2) Führer Hitler has expressed "friendly intentions" towards Britain, and Britain has always been prepared to discuss various outstanding issues and disarmament issues with Germany; (3) This general issue of substance is not related to the issue of Britain's guarantee to Poland. However, under strong threats, Poland would not be able to accept Germany's dictatorial orders and negotiate with it.

Polish people here are gratified that Britain's attitude is extremely firm and that Germany's attempt to create a second Munich has failed to materialize. In short, British government officials believe that while the countries of the Peace Front are still prepared to discuss various outstanding issues, they are determined to resist strong pressure and reject unilateral solutions. Although Germany is exchanging views with Britain and France, unless it agrees to negotiate on an equal footing and in a spirit of freedom, the current tense situation may not be eased. What Germany's attitude will ultimately be can be seen after the British reply reaches Berlin, whether the country responds again or takes violent action. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Paris, it is rumored that German Führer Hitler presented a concrete peace plan when he met with the British and French ambassadors yesterday. Sources close to the government here deny this, saying that when Hitler met with British Ambassador Henderson, he only expressed his willingness to reclaim the Free City of Danzig and part of the Polish Corridor in accordance with the "generous proposals" he made in his speech to the Reichstag on April 28 of this year. (Note: Hitler said at the time that Germany proposed: (1) Danzig should return to Germany; (2) Germany should build one autobahn and one railway across the Polish Corridor; (3) Germany recognizes Poland's economic interests in Danzig; (4) Clearly define the German-Polish border.) and demanded that the German minority in Poland be transferred to Germany. Apart from this, there are no other proposals. People here generally believe that the optimistic comments made by Berlin and the rumors of Hitler's so-called peace plan are intended to shift the responsibility for future events to Britain and France, so that they can accuse Britain and France of being warmongers before world opinion. Responsible officials also said that Hitler's proposal in April of this year had already been rejected by Poland, and Poland seems unlikely to accept greater sacrifices at this time. Therefore, although a peaceful solution is not completely hopeless, it can be asserted that Britain and France will not succumb to Germany's threats. The speeches made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier the other day have clearly defined the positions of the two countries, and it is well known to the world that they cannot make further concessions.

### British Authorities Busy with Negotiations; Cabinet Meets Twice; French Ambassador Visits Hitler Again; Demands Concrete Explanation of Opinions

London, the cabinet was originally scheduled to hold a cabinet meeting at 10:30 a.m. to draft a reply to be taken to Berlin by Ambassador Henderson and presented to Führer Hitler. Because the wording of this reply needs to be carefully considered, the cabinet meeting has been changed to 3:00 p.m. Ambassador Henderson also paid a visit to Prime Minister Chamberlain at 11:00 a.m. for a confidential discussion lasting 35 minutes. Foreign Secretary Halifax, Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs Butler, Sir Cadogan, Home Secretary Hoare, and Minister without Portfolio Anderson successively arrived to conduct talks. They gradually dispersed at 1:00 p.m. At 2:30 p.m., Foreign Secretary Halifax again paid a visit to the Prime Minister to conduct talks. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

London, Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax discussed the European situation this afternoon for three hours. The Foreign Secretary then received Polish Ambassador Raczynski, and the Prime Minister went to Buckingham Palace to meet King George VI for an hour and a half. At the same time, Dominion Affairs Minister Inskip received representatives of the various Dominions and informed them of the situation. The cabinet then held an important meeting at 6:30 p.m. at the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street to discuss the proposals of Führer Hitler brought by Ambassador Henderson. It ended at 8:55 p.m. Ambassador Henderson was also summoned to attend. According to official sources, a cabinet subcommittee is scheduled to continue meeting in the evening to draft an answer, which will be submitted to the full cabinet for approval tomorrow before being taken to Berlin by Ambassador Henderson. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Berlin, French Ambassador Coulondre, having received orders from his government, paid another visit to Führer Hitler this afternoon and spoke with him for 30 minutes. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Paris, it is heard that the French government's instructions to Ambassador Coulondre in Berlin are largely the same as French Prime Minister Daladier's broadcast speech. In short, France is prepared to cooperate and resolve disputes through negotiations, but is determined to oppose the use of force. According to French sources, Hitler's remarks to Coulondre the day before were rather vague. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Paris, responsible parties have declared that after French Ambassador Coulondre's meeting with Führer Hitler yesterday, he reported the details to the government. This morning, Prime Minister Daladier, together with Foreign Minister Bonnet and Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Léger, studied them and will immediately send a new instruction to Ambassador Coulondre, instructing him to visit Führer Hitler again. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Paris, at this time of extreme crisis, the morning newspapers and public opinion here are very calm. Generally, it is said that the policy to deal with the situation is very clear, that is, to resist all attempts to use force and, at the same time, to negotiate on a reasonable basis. As for the peace proposals that German Führer Hitler handed to British Ambassador Henderson to take back to London, the morning newspapers here do not seem to regard them as an acceptable basis for negotiation, because Germany's demands regarding the city of Danzig are still backed by direct action. In addition, the newspapers also said that the future is not hopeless and that peace can still achieve a final victory, but fear that this is a "German peace." Le Journal reported that after Führer Hitler met with our country's ambassador to Germany, Coulondre, our government's standing committee has instructed the ambassador to present an answer, the content of which is to explain the military measures announced by the government yesterday and to inform them that although France is eager to establish a peaceful solution, it is also prepared to deal with extraordinary events. It is heard that this answer was issued after notifying the British government. In short, what Ambassador Coulondre was ordered to explain to Führer Hitler was none other than the position explained by Prime Minister Daladier in his broadcast speech the other day. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

### Berlin Quietly Awaits British Reply; Germany and Italy Continue to Exchange Views

Berlin, British Ambassador Henderson is scheduled to return here tomorrow with the British government's reply. The general public is eagerly awaiting it. Well-informed sources also said that at least for the moment there is "room to breathe." The situation is not expected to have any major developments before tomorrow. Italian newspapers' comments are highly regarded for the efforts made by all parties to avoid war, which is very noteworthy. In addition, there is no talk of convening the German Reichstag, but all members of the Reichstag are staying in the capital. The venue, the Kroll Opera House, has also been prepared for the meeting. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Paris, according to well-informed German sources, Ambassador Henderson's return to Berlin can at least slow down the evolution of the situation. It is expected that before tomorrow, no major decisions will be made by all parties. Hitler had originally planned to convene the parliament tonight, but has now abandoned the plan. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Berlin, Führer Hitler received Air Minister Goering at noon today, and then received Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and General Goering at 5:30 p.m. The important role that General Goering plays in recent activities can be seen from this. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Rome, German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen again relayed opinions from Führer Hitler via long-distance telephone to Prime Minister Mussolini this afternoon. The Prime Minister immediately presented an answer and asked Ambassador Mackensen to relay it to Führer Hitler. Foreign Minister Ciano was also present at the time. However, what Hitler's opinions and Mussolini's answer contained are still unknown. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Rome, political figures here all acknowledge that the situation is extremely serious, but also realize that peace is not yet hopeless. This view is based on two facts: (1) As of now, no irreversible event has occurred; (2) The authorities of major European countries are still maintaining diplomatic contact. In particular, Italy, which is at the center of the Berlin-Rome axis, has a more moderate attitude and is actively engaged in mediation. Regarding this, the famous journalist Gayda (who is regarded as Prime Minister Mussolini's mouthpiece) recently published an article in the semi-official newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia, which said: "Italy has issued a statement that it is willing to act completely in concert with Germany and to actively act politically for peace on the basis of justice. However, it is not yet known whether this action can obtain full understanding in Europe so that it can develop smoothly." The Rome Daily News reported that Prime Minister Mussolini and German Führer Hitler have repeatedly exchanged views via long-distance telephone, and Britain and France are also actively engaged in activities. All of this deserves special attention. "At this time, what tens of millions of people are praying for is that common sense can prevail. The land and oceans of the world are so vast that all countries can have an appropriate place. No matter how sensitive the issues are, there is no reason why they must be resolved by force. This method of resolution only sacrifices millions of lives." (Havas dispatch, 25th)

### Turkey Supports the Peace Front; President Receives German Ambassador

Istanbul, today's newspapers here report that the country will always absolutely adhere to its promises and support the Balkan and Anglo-French Peace Front. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Istanbul, Turkey. It is rumored that Turkey is currently considering signing a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. The French-language "République" newspaper here denies this, saying that the purpose of this rumor is to undermine the unity of the Balkan Entente countries, and its intentions are sinister and should not be believed. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Istanbul, Turkish President Inönü received the German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, today before departing for Ankara to attend parliament. Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu was also present. Political figures attach great importance to this meeting. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Voroshilov Explains the Reasons for the Breakdown of the Anglo-French-Soviet Negotiations; the Point of Contention is that Poland Does Not Allow Passage

Moscow, Izvestia recently sent a representative to meet with Soviet Chief Military Representative Voroshilov to ask a number of questions regarding the Anglo-French-Soviet military negotiations, which were answered separately as follows:

(Question) Why were the negotiations with the Anglo-French military delegation suspended?

(Answer) Because serious disputes arose during the negotiations, they have been declared broken down. The Anglo-French military delegation has already departed for their home countries.

(Question) What exactly is the content of this dispute? Can we hear about it?

(Answer) The Soviet military delegation believes that since the Soviet Union does not border the aggressor countries, if its troops want to assist Britain, France, and Poland, they must be allowed to pass through Polish territory. There is no other way to come into contact with the aggressor's troops. If Soviet troops are not allowed to pass through Poland, they cannot engage in military cooperation with British and French troops. This is the same as if British and American troops were not allowed to operate in France during the last World War, they could not engage in military cooperation with French troops. However, although this position is obviously completely correct, the Anglo-French military representatives did not agree. The Polish government even publicly declared that the country does not need or accept Soviet military assistance. Therefore, military cooperation between the Soviet Union and these countries became impossible. This is the basic point of contention, and therefore the negotiations were declared broken down.

(Question) Has the issue of supplying Poland with raw materials and military materials been discussed during the negotiations?

(Answer) It has not been discussed. The supply of raw materials and military materials is a commercial issue. If only these materials are to be supplied to Poland, there is no need to conclude a mutual assistance pact, let alone a military alliance. For example, the United States and several other countries, including Japan, have not concluded a mutual assistance pact or military alliance, but they have continuously sold raw materials and military materials to Japan for the past two years, even though Japan is at war with China. The negotiations discussed military assistance, not the supply of raw materials and military materials.

(Question) According to a diplomatic correspondent for the British Daily Mail, the Anglo-French military delegation asked the Soviet delegation whether the Soviet Union was prepared to supply Poland with aircraft and military supplies, and to station the Red Army on the border to prepare. The Soviet Union then replied with the following suggestion: "After the outbreak of war, immediately occupy Vilnius and Nowogródek in the northeast, and occupy the three provinces of Lviv, Tarnopol, and Stanisławów in the southeast. If necessary, the Red Army can provide Poland with military assistance from these areas." What do you think of this statement by the newspaper's diplomatic correspondent? Does it correspond to the facts?

(Answer) This statement is a lie from beginning to end. Its author is a barbaric liar, and the newspaper that publishes this kind of lie by its diplomatic correspondent is a rumor-mongering newspaper.

(Question) According to a Reuters radio broadcast, Voroshilov told the leaders of the Anglo-French military delegation today that since the Soviet Union and Germany have concluded a non-aggression pact, the Soviet government believes that there is no purpose in continuing negotiations with Britain and France." Does this statement by Reuters correspond to the facts?

(Answer) It does not correspond to the facts. The breakdown of negotiations with the Anglo-French military delegation was not because the Soviet Union and Germany concluded a non-aggression pact. On the contrary, the conclusion of a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany, among other reasons, was one of the consequences of the Anglo-French military negotiations being deadlocked due to insurmountable disputes. (TASS dispatch, 26th)

Moscow, the Anglo-French military delegation left Moscow by train yesterday. The representatives of both countries were dressed in civilian clothes, in stark contrast to the gorgeous uniforms and gold emblems they wore when they arrived. The Russian officers who saw them off were the same ones who had welcomed them before. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)

Editorial

### European Changes and the Far East

The European crisis had been brewing for some time, becoming increasingly acute by mid-August. On the 23rd night, the Soviet Union suddenly concluded a non-aggression treaty with Germany, completing the agreement in the blink of an eye. As a result, the European situation, and indeed the entire international landscape, underwent a transformation. The Soviet Union has at least two wishes in Europe: first, to ensure stability on its western frontier. It initially engaged with Britain and France to restrain Germany's eastward expansion. Ultimately, it concluded a treaty with Germany, securing a solemn pledge that Germany would not advance eastward. Its change of heart is consistent: second, to sit idly by and observe the rise and fall of capitalist nations. When threatened by Germany's arrogance, it began to approach Britain and France, but this carried the risk of being drawn into a vortex of trouble. Subsequently, the promise of 200 million German marks and a guarantee of abandoning the eastward expansion policy enticed Germany to Moscow. This sincerity was evident, and the Soviet Union broke away from Britain and France. In these shifting alliances, why should the Soviet Union prioritize being close to Britain or France, Germany, or have any emotional attachments, affections, or resentments when it could remain outside the whirlpool? Achieving both goals in one move was a major gain for the Soviet Union. As for its impact on the European situation, we are not yet ready to see this as an opportunity for the countries in the vortex to move towards rise and fall. However, we can infer that the scope of the war will be reduced when a European war breaks out. The Soviet-German link has already been largely disentangled. Germany and Italy are allies, and should presumably "share blessings and share hardships." However, the conditions conveyed by the British ambassador to Germany, Henderson, between Berlin and London were all requests from the German side, with nothing pertaining to Italy. Therefore, the war is being fought because the conditions were not met. What does Italy have to do with it? This is no accident; there must be a subtle purpose in this final act of diplomacy. Not only that, but the possibility of Germany enticing Japan to join the war has also decreased to almost zero. Therefore, while the issue of the Free City of Danzig was once seen as the trigger for a world war, today we can at least infer that the initial stages of the war will be confined to Europe, with the Soviet Union outside its scope, and the Far East even further removed.

Whether there will be war is uncertain. If there is war, it is also uncertain whether it will be a swift, decisive conflict or a large-scale, protracted one. However, the geographical scope of the initial stages of the war is smaller than previously observed, as mentioned above. The time it takes to evolve from the initial stage to the next will be inversely proportional to the geographical scope. If war is unavoidable and cannot be resolved quickly, the various possible developments in the international arena will become increasingly chaotic and complex due to the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. Making this chaos and complexity simple and clear will naturally require a longer period of brewing. Although there is no war yet, the various brewing processes for the next stage have already begun. The initial stage of the European war has no bearing on China; the overall situation in the next stage depends on the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan. Therefore, we must closely monitor the beginnings of this brewing process today.

Let's start with the United States: it cherishes freedom, adheres to democracy, safeguards international justice, and respects treaty obligations. It does not lightly abandon its interests, its peace, or its traditional policy of non-involvement in disputes outside the Americas. It is frank, sincere, and does not favor expediency. It is strong, resolute, and responsible, not exploiting others, nor being exploited by them. All these virtues are the foundation of American policy. Grasping this foundation to observe America's advances and retreats will be accurate in the majority of cases. The few things that could go wrong are short-sighted greed and narrow-minded isolationism, but its statesmen and public opinion can usually overcome these. Before and after the 23rd night of this month, the fundamentals of American policy have not changed at all. However, that night was not without a considerable degree of nightmares. Through this nightmare, it strengthened its sympathy for Britain and France on the one hand, and intensified its consideration of measures on the other. President Roosevelt's telegrams to King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and German leader Hitler were sincere appeals for peace in the face of the European crisis. However, in respecting the independence and sovereignty of other nations and condemning aggression and hegemony, he did not mince his words. This is how he demonstrated his moral convictions and a clear testament to the unchanging nature of American policy. From this, one can imagine the outline of America in the next stage of the war. Further extending this observation to the Far East, American policy will also remain consistent. It cannot be threatened by violence, enticed by the division of spoils, or swayed by the wavering intentions of Britain and France. Yesterday, a certain party propagated that American diplomats believed that after Japan was hit by the Soviet-German treaty, it would continue to advance militarily in China, preserve the interests of Britain and the United States diplomatically, and the United States would also accept Japan's willingness to cooperate with Britain and the United States, restoring normal political and commercial relations between the United States and Japan. The purpose of this propaganda is to use the smoke screen of so-called "American diplomats" to send subtle advances to Japan, implying that the United States would acknowledge Japan's military aggression in China and allow Japan to repair relations with the United States. Its goal is to use the United States as a bridge, sacrificing China, to seek compromise with Japan on behalf of Britain and France. Not to mention that the United States will never be exploited, and will never abandon its moral convictions or change its Far Eastern policy. Even the wise men in Britain and France would not make such a humble request, only revealing the wavering and shamelessness of those who spread such propaganda. These are not the words of American citizens, especially not the words of so-called American diplomats or other responsible officials. Nevertheless, judging from this propaganda, it can be seen that brewing is developing in many directions.

Given the tension in Europe, and given that non-democratic countries like the Soviet Union and Germany each abandoned Britain, France, and Japan for their own needs, it is understandable that Britain, France, and Japan are anxious to find partners. Given America's strength, it is especially desirable for Britain, France, and Japan to court it. Britain, France, and Japan have long been at odds due to conflicting interests in the Far East. Now, the changes in the Soviet Union and Germany have given Britain, France, and Japan a sense of shared suffering, which is likely to lead to a subconscious desire for mutual affection. Let's examine the forms and atmosphere: such propaganda as mentioned above is one sign; widespread rumors of easing tensions in Shanghai and Shenzhen are another sign; widespread rumors of the cessation of the anti-British movement are a third sign; widespread rumors of the possible revival of British-Japanese talks in Tokyo are a fourth sign; and the Tokyo military clique's deliberate claim that Germany is mediating between the Soviet Union and Japan, not just making things up, is a veiled threat to Britain and France, a fifth sign. These forms and atmosphere are too numerous to list, and it is expected that there will be more brewing in the future. There is certainly a clear path among them. Japan only needs to change its course, abandon its puppet regime, and completely abandon its policy of aggression. Then, not only will there be nothing that cannot be discussed between China and Japan, but the Pacific Ocean will also be calm. Britain and France will no longer have any barriers with Japan and can also help stabilize the European situation. What can prompt Japan to change its course? First, China's resolute resistance; second, America's strong and unwavering policy; and third, the dramatic changes in Soviet-German policy. What will make Japan cling to aggression is the wavering intentions of Britain and France! However, if Britain and France do waver, how can they shake China and the United States? Japan has no friends, Britain and France have friends, China has many friends, and everyone wants to befriend the United States. Today, the various brewing processes in the vortex of nations are focused on seeking good friends. Those who do not carefully assess the international situation may gain bad friends or even make enemies. China can never have too many friends, and it does not worry about having no friends. But Britain and France, in their hesitation, may ruin themselves!

### Nuremberg Rally Canceled, Germany Intensifies Preparations, European Transportation Disrupted, Berlin Implements Rationing, French Government Evacuates Paris

Berlin: The semi-official German News Agency recently announced that the annual Nazi Party rally, originally scheduled to open in Nuremberg on September 2, has been canceled. Whether it will be held in the future will depend on the circumstances. (Havas, August 26)

Berlin: Today, hundreds of people gathered again in front of the Prime Minister's Office, seemingly waiting for something. However, no military or political figures were seen entering or leaving, a situation quite different from yesterday. Residents collected food ration coupons, which were distributed to each household by the authorities this morning. Housewives were greatly shocked, but the authorities tried their best to explain that this measure was not extraordinary in nature. Its purpose was merely to adjust the market and ensure the fair distribution of various foods. In fact, there was a good wheat harvest this year, and the country currently has 8.6 million tons of miscellaneous grains in storage, enough for a year. There is also no shortage of milk. Although today is Sunday, most residents did not go to the countryside for leisure because they were waiting for the situation to develop. As a result, there was more traffic on the streets than usual. However, private cars were insufficient due to the authorities' restrictions on gasoline sales. In addition, an international train left here for Belgium at 8:00 this morning. It is said that this was the final departure; thereafter, it will only run to Cologne, Germany. Political figures are unwilling to express their opinions on the situation. One official joked, "Everyone is shuffling the cards." (Havas, August 27)

Paris: Local morning newspapers, such as L'Intransigeant and Le Petit Journal, both published photos today of British troops arriving in France. Judging by their uniforms and badges, these British troops seem to be marines and colonial troops. It is heard that these British troops arrived in France aboard the British ship "Brighton" and have now arrived at Dieppe. It is reported that 2,000 British soldiers arrived in Dieppe yesterday, and together with those who arrived in France last week, there are now 5,000 British soldiers in France. (Associated Press, August 27)

Paris: Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier summoned General Gamelin, Chief of the General Staff of the National Defense, and Vice Admiral Darlan, Chief of the Naval Staff, this morning for talks. (Havas, August 27)

Paris: The Ministry of Public Works recently issued an announcement with urgent wording, stating that all people, especially women and children, who have no need to stay in Paris should leave as soon as possible while transportation is still convenient. If they linger any longer, it is feared that transportation will be restricted. (Havas, August 27)

Berlin: National military preparations are still being actively carried out. The post office has suspended the receipt and dispatch of civilian letters from today onwards, so that it can focus on delivering mail to conscripted soldiers and recruits. Once this is completed, a notice will be published in the newspapers to restore normal operations. The railway authorities have also decided to reduce the number of passenger trains from tomorrow. The stations in the capital are very crowded today. In addition to foreign expatriates waiting for international trains to leave Germany, there are also many uniformed officers and conscripted reservists waiting to depart. Air Minister General Göring has ordered a ban on private German aircraft and foreign aircraft from flying over Germany, with the exception of air force aircraft, government aircraft, and scheduled German airmail services. In addition to military aircraft, flights must not exceed 500 meters in altitude. Special measures have been taken at Tempelhof and Königsberg airports for security. In addition, shipping between German ports and the Free City of Danzig has been suspended since noon today. The government has also ordered a ban on gas stations selling gasoline to private users. Gasoline stored in various places is being requisitioned by the government. Radio stations interspersed news broadcasts with military music recordings, which is similar to the situation during the Czech crisis in September last year and March this year. Hundreds of citizens gathered in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister's Office, watching the constant coming and going of government officials and foreign diplomats. The situation inside the Prime Minister's Office was particularly tense last night, with work continuing throughout the night. When the crowd saw Air Minister General Göring, their cheers were the loudest. (Havas, August 26)

Warsaw: It is reported that the Nazi Party in Danzig has seized Polish grain, oil, and other goods stored within its borders. At the same time, news of border clashes is still frequent. Near Chojnice, a German patrol crossed the border and exchanged machine gun fire with a Polish patrol. Similar incidents occurred on the East Prussian border. One German was killed in each of the above two incidents. (Reuters, August 27)

Danzig: Anti-aircraft guns, previously hidden from view, have been moved into broad daylight today by order of the Danzig military authorities. This may be a prelude to the Danzig authorities announcing a merger with Germany. It is now generally believed that Danzig's return to Germany is only a matter of time. The streets are filled with martial figures. The music broadcast from loudspeakers in public places yesterday was mostly military music that aroused fighting spirit. At the same time, many Polish officials have moved out of Danzig. The German battleship "Schleswig-Holstein" is currently docked in the port of Danzig, less than half a mile from the Polish ammunition depot. (Associated Press, August 27)

Paris: Mobilization is proceeding step by step. While there is little sign of military preparations in the center of Paris, military activity outside the city is everywhere. Military trucks and requisitioned public cars and trams are moving in long lines. Troops are also being transferred busily. (Reuters, August 27)

Amsterdam: According to reports from Oldenzaal in eastern Netherlands, German soldiers are working busily on the Dutch-German border, building wire obstacles.

(Vienna) Today, regulations were published here stipulating that meat, milk, sugar, coffee, tea, ham, soap, and coal will be issued to the public by the authorities on a per capita basis. (Reuters, August 27)

### German Transportation Routes Obstructed

Amsterdam

The German side of the Dutch-German border has now placed barbed wire and other obstacles to block roads and prohibit traffic in the vicinity. Border personnel have now been replaced by armed German soldiers. Cross-border rail traffic has been suspended. (Reuters, August 26)

Berlin: The government has decided to implement rationing for certain daily necessities such as soap, coal, axes, boots, and shoes. However, people are still allowed to freely purchase bread, eggs, flour, potatoes, cocoa, and other foods. (Havas, August 26)

Antwerp, Belgium: German ships loading and unloading goods in this port have received orders from the German government to return to Germany immediately. However, Italian ships are loading and unloading goods as usual. The same order was issued to German ships in September last year during the international crisis. (Havas, August 26)

Copenhagen, Denmark: The German railway authorities announced today that passenger and freight traffic crossing the Danish border at Padborg will be temporarily suspended from 10:00 AM tomorrow. (Reuters, August 26)

Berlin: Regarding reports in foreign newspapers that the German government intends to move its offices to the outskirts of Berlin, officials denied it last night, saying that the government does not intend to take this measure. (Haitong, August 27)

Madrid: The German government has ordered all German merchant ships to dock in German ports or ports in other neutral countries. Three German ships arrived in Vigo today, and several German ships are also docked in the ports of Galicia. (Associated Press, August 27)

London: After receiving advice from the German Embassy, ​​correspondents from German newspapers and news agencies stationed in England returned home this afternoon. (Havas, August 26)

### French Reservists Continue to Be Called Up in Three Classes

Paris: Three more classes of French reservists were called up today. (Reuters, August 26)

Paris: The Aviation Ministry has issued an order stating that the area stretching east from Calais, through Paris and Lyon, and reaching Marseille in the south, is prohibited from aircraft overflight from 9:00 AM on August 27. However, aircraft are still allowed to land and take off at the airports in Calais, Paris, Lyon, and Marseille. (Havas, August 26)

Rabat, French Morocco: General Noguès, the Resident General of Morocco, has ordered that all aircraft other than French aircraft and aircraft belonging to scheduled airlines are prohibited from flying over Moroccan airspace. The export of certain products and raw materials is prohibited, and those who have stored such items must register with local authorities. (Havas, August 26)

### Estimated Strength of the Anglo-French Allied Fleet

London: At the start of a European war, the main force of the Anglo-French Allied Fleet will be more than double that of the Italian-German Allied Fleet. However, British naval experts acknowledge that the strength of Britain and France will be affected because the fleets of Britain and France must be responsible for patrolling vast coastlines. Accurate strength calculations on national navies are impossible to obtain as they are matters of military secrecy. Great powers are actively building ships, which makes accurate calculation of ship counts difficult. By tonnage alone, Britain's fleet is double that of the combined Italian-German Fleet. However, the strength of Britain's naval bases against the German air force and the fact that Britain must send a large part of its navy to patrol the Empire are important factors in the estimation of British naval strength.

### Central Authorities Jointly Commemorate Confucius' Birthday

—Kong Xiangxi Speaks on "Confucius' Teachings and the Future of the Nation"—

Today in Chongqing, the Central Committee and the National Government jointly held a commemoration at 8:00 AM in the National Government Auditorium. Attendees included Central Committee members Kong Xiangxi, Li Wenfan, He Yingqin, Chen Lifu, Wang Chonghui, Jiang Zuobin, Chen Shaokuan, He Yaozu, Zhang Zhizhong, Pan Gongzhan, He Jian, Gan Naiguang, etc., as well as Interior Minister Zhou Zhongyue, Confucius' descendant Kong Decheng, and more than 300 heads of various central and national government agencies. President Kong presided over the event, leading the attendees in a formal ceremony. President Kong then delivered a speech on "Confucius' Teachings and the Future of the Nation." The original text is as follows:

Fellow comrades, today is the birthday commemoration of the Sage Confucius. The Central Committee and the National Government are holding an expanded commemoration ceremony. I, Xiangxi, have been ordered to preside and report. I will briefly discuss my personal thoughts on the relationship between Confucius' teachings and the nation and the people. I hope my fellow comrades will correct me. Throughout history, the establishment of a nation and the prosperity of a people must have a kind of spiritual power. Our country has stood for thousands of years, and although it has repeatedly experienced trials and tribulations, it has always been able to overcome all difficulties and stand firm in the universe. This is because it has been maintained by this spiritual power, and the emergence of this spiritual power comes from

Confucius' teachings. The development of our country's culture, the cultivation of national spirit, the maintenance of social morality, and all the theories and methods of governing the country and ensuring peace, all originate from Confucius' teachings. The Prime Minister devoted his life to revolutionary theory, which mostly originated from our country's orthodox doctrines. He also incorporated the spirit of modern science and strongly advocated restoring our country's inherent virtues, taking loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and love as the basis of the country, and righteousness, propriety, integrity, and shame as the means of saving the country. Wisdom, benevolence, and courage are to be used to build the country. They are both internally consistent and practically applied. In recent years, President Chiang, seeing the decline of the people's hearts and the corruption of social customs, launched the New Life Movement based on the Prime Minister's teachings, promoting

inherent morality

in order to rectify abuses, eliminate the old and establish the new. All of this recognizes that Confucius' teachings are the foundation of the country, applicable to all places and passed down through the ages without confusion. The government, recognizing this, has recently designated Confucius' birthday as National Teachers' Day by the Executive Yuan to show respect for teachers and the importance of education, so that the people of the country will have a model, and Confucius' teachings can be developed and promoted, strengthening the foundation of the country and revitalizing the nation. Today, at the Sage's birthday commemoration, I will briefly report on the most important aspects of Confucius' teachings in relation to the nation and the people, as follows: (1) Confucius' teachings and national culture. Our country is a nation with a long history and advanced culture, which is envied by countries all over the world. The reason why it has such a vast and splendid culture that will last for centuries is because Confucius is the only teacher. His most significant contributions to national culture are the following: (1)

Carrying on the Past and Opening up the Future

Confucius followed Yao and Shun, modeled Wen and Wu, followed the rhythm of the heavens, and imitated the nature of the land. He compiled the Book of Songs and the Book of Documents, established the rites and music, praised the Book of Changes, and revised the Spring and Autumn Annals. He comprehensively sorted out past systems, taking the essence and discarding the dross, so that later students would know what to choose and easily understand its mysteries. This had a kind of effect of carrying on the past and opening up the future in sorting out national culture. Not only was the culture of the three dynasties and above made more evident because of this, but the culture of the three dynasties and below was passed down because of this. His great contribution cannot be erased. (2)

Education for All

Confucius established his school in the Apricot Altar, with three thousand disciples, and taught all students regardless of their background, pioneering the education of the common people. When Europe was united by politics and religion, academic research could only be freely pursued in churches and among the aristocracy. Ordinary people had almost no opportunity to freely enjoy education. Only in our country, since ancient times, has learning been open and educational opportunities equal. Confucius once said, "I have never refused to teach anyone who can offer me a bundle of dried meat." He also never showed favoritism to his own family. Therefore, "Chen Kang asked Boyu, 'Have you heard anything different from your father?' Boyu replied, 'No. Once, when he was standing alone, I hurried past the courtyard, and he asked, "Have you studied the Book of Songs?" I replied, "Not yet." He said, "If you don't study the Book of Songs, you will have nothing to say." I retreated and studied the Book of Songs. Another day, when he was standing alone, I hurried past the courtyard, and he asked, "Have you studied the Book of Rites?" I replied, "Not yet." He said, "If you don't study the Book of Rites, you will have nothing to stand on." I retreated and studied the Book of Rites.' Hearing these two things, Chen Yuan retreated and happily said, 'Asking one, I got three, hearing about the Book of Songs and the Book of Rites, and also hearing that the gentleman distances himself from his son.'" He thought that his learning was not only for himself, so he could spread it to the people and pass it on to future generations. (3)

Perfect System

Confucius' contribution to our country's culture, in the vertical aspect, was the work of carrying on the past, opening up the future, and developing it. In the horizontal aspect, he taught all students regardless of their background and established the foundation of the education of the common people. In terms of educational methods, he established a perfect system that is still a good standard for education today. Since ancient times, education has been given in the six arts of rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic, which includes the three aspects of moral, intellectual, and physical education without any omissions. Confucius also divided the curriculum into four subjects: morality, speech, politics, and literature, teaching each student according to their aptitude and abilities. This is more complete than modern scientific education methods, because now most specialized universities focus on the influx of knowledge and lack moral education. In fact, teaching people should put morality first. Today's neglect of the fundamental and pursuit of the superficial is indeed a major defect in the education system.

### War Zone Enterprise Restrictions

Chongqing: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, in order to maintain the original organization of profit-making legal entities, the government formulated the "Provisional Measures for Maintaining the Status Quo of Profit-Making Legal Entities during Extraordinary Times" and promulgated them for implementation. Its main goal was to prevent treacherous individuals from infiltrating and undermining enterprises. Since its implementation, it has achieved considerable success. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, for the sake of greater prudence, has separately formulated five items for restricting various enterprises in war zones or near war zones, as follows: (1) The change of name of each fishery right and mining right holder, or the transfer, mortgage, or alteration of its rights and interests, and the change of name of forestry contractors, state-owned mining right lessees, or those who have obtained special business rights, shall all be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. Any that have not been approved shall be invalid. (2) The premises and equipment of each farm, forest farm, pasture, fishery, mine, factory, or company, and the real estate in which they invest, shall not be used for other purposes or mortgaged to others without submitting an application to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. (3) The transfer or mortgage of shares of each company, or the change of name of shareholders, shall all be reported to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record. Any that have not been reported to the Ministry shall be invalid. (4) Each company shall, in accordance with the law, set aside a sufficient amount of public reserve fund each year. All accumulated public reserve funds shall not be withdrawn or used without submitting an application to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval, and shall be deposited in a national bank. If they have already been deposited in a registered commercial bank or local bank and it is inconvenient to deposit them, an application shall also be submitted to the Ministry for approval and record. (5) If a company or other enterprise organizer or representative enters into a contract or deed with a foreign merchant regarding rights and interests, it shall be invalid without submitting an application to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. The above five measures have been approved by the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration has been requested to instruct courts at all levels to take note. (27th Telegram)

Although this claim has not yet been confirmed, the German flags that were once extremely common in the former German concession have all been removed since the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact.

Hong Kong: Tonight, the morale here has turned slightly stable, partly because the international situation has eased slightly, and partly because the British cruisers HMS "Topsail," "Cornwallis," and "Canterbury" have arrived here.

Thirdly, the Japanese consul stationed in Hong Kong visited the Governor of Hong Kong today, stating that even if war breaks out in Europe, Japanese nationals in Hong Kong will not evacuate, and said that he believes that Hong Kong has absolutely no possibility of being drawn into the vortex of war. (27th Associated Press Telegram)

Hong Kong: Although the Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong guaranteed yesterday that Hong Kong would not be drawn into the vortex even if a European war broke out, civilians are still continuing to evacuate Hong Kong today. The Japanese Consul-General's statement was used to slightly alleviate the general fear that the Japanese army might take the opportunity to attack Hong Kong when a European war breaks out, but the fear has increased after the Japanese army continued to arrive in the New Territories last night. The Japanese army has now occupied the entire British border area from Dapeng Bay to the coast. According to shipping companies, all berths within two weeks have been pre-booked. Chinese residents in Hong Kong have begun to organize a "City Self-Defense Force" to help the Hong Kong government maintain order in the event of an emergency. (27th Associated Press Telegram)

### Germany Continuously Provokes Poland: Border Crossing Incidents Reach 34 in Two Days; Poland Says It Will Never Succumb to Threats

Warsaw: Responsible parties here have recently stated that there have been as many as 34 incidents of German incursions into the Polish border in the past two days. The various news spread by the German semi-official agency Deutsche Nachrichten-Agentur, such as (1) Polish aircraft invading the airspace of the Slovak state to distribute leaflets, (2) extremely large numbers of Germans arrested in Poland, with 30,000 arrested in Brest-Litovsk and thousands arrested in Silesia and Pomerania, (3) the military authorities in Bielany occupying three factories run by Germans in Łódź and discarding the machines in the streets, are all not true.

(27th Associated Press Telegram)

Warsaw: Today, the news of the signing of the Anglo-Polish alliance here is extremely exciting. A government spokesperson said that Britain has never undertaken such an obligation since the Napoleonic Wars, but it begins today. From now on, if Poland's interests in Danzig are slightly damaged, Poland will have to take appropriate and far-reaching steps. In Poland's view, the following actions are sufficient to damage Poland's interests: (1) attempts to annex Danzig into Germany, (2) not including Danzig within Polish customs, (3) transferring Poland's interests in Danzig to a third party for management, (4) interfering with the rights of Polish minorities within Danzig. The spokesperson also said that Germans in Danzig should obviously enjoy full cultural, economic, political, and internal rights, but the Danzig Senate's appointment of Forster as the head of state of Danzig is far contrary to the charter of the Free City of Danzig. Poland will determine its attitude based on the motive of this change. Germany obviously has an intention to accuse Poland of deploying troops for aggression and to shift the blame for war to Poland.

### Yugoslav Cabinet Reorganization; New Cabinet Promulgates Orders

After the Yugoslav capital city government recently reached a compromise with Croatian leader Maček, the cabinet has been reorganized. The position of Prime Minister is still held by Cvetković, and Croatian representatives have joined the cabinet. The new cabinet has a national unity character, with eleven representatives from the Serbian ethnic group, including four from the Radical Union Party, one from the Independent Democratic Party, one from the Bosnian Farmers' Party, and three from the former Radical Party who are non-partisan (namely, Foreign Minister Marković, Defense Minister General Nedić, and Secretary-General of the State Council, the famous jurist Konstantinović).

### Difficulties in Treaty Negotiations Between Hungary and Romania

Capital City of Romania: After the government recently suggested to Hungary that they conclude a non-aggression treaty, the Hungarian government submitted a reply yesterday, advocating the conclusion of an agreement to resolve the issue of Hungarian minorities within Romania. Well-informed sources here have stated that the government may not consider this, as the government's proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Hungary was intended to dispel past grievances. If they were now to negotiate a minority agreement, it would be enough to provoke disputes and intensify past discord, which would be unnecessary. (August 27, Havas)

Capital City of Romania: Regarding the situation in Europe, in addition to publishing dispatches from the capitals of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Poland, the newspapers here are paying attention to the following two facts: (1) Romania is willing to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Hungary, but it has been rejected by Hungary; (2) the Turkish authorities have issued a statement expressing their willingness to fulfill their commitments. Both of these matters are of great importance to Romania's relations. Regarding the first point, the Hungarian government has its difficulties. Even if its independence is threatened, it is not convenient to break away from the German-Italian axis and implement an independent and autonomous policy. Romania originally understood this. Regarding the second point, Bulgaria is surrounded by the Balkan Entente countries. Unless Germany and Italy promise to provide substantial assistance, it will not attack Romania. In addition, Turkey has already stated its willingness to fulfill its commitments, so Romania can rest assured. (August 27, Havas)

Ottawa – The Canadian Air Force was ordered today to prepare to move to war stations. (August 26, Reuters)

### Battle for Chao'an West Gate; Japanese Troops Repeatedly Ambushed, Suffering Heavy Casualties; Chinese Troops Bravely Attack Japanese Headquarters

Shantou Correspondence: The Chao-Shan war has now entered a tough stalemate. On the 8th of this month, the Japanese side transferred 500 puppet troops from Guangzhou to Shantou, and then immediately transferred them to Anbu to guard various strongholds along the railway line. On the 12th, six Japanese warships anchored at Houzhai in Nan'ao, and 300 Japanese soldiers were immediately dispatched to build defensive fortifications around the island of Nan'ao. The Nan'ao Highway and airfield have already been completed. Fishermen are forced to work, whipped like cattle and horses. Those who suffer from heatstroke and cannot carry mud are shot publicly as a warning. Currently, the Japanese planes that harass Chaozhou and Meizhou mostly fly out of Qianjiang in Nan'ao. Therefore, although the Japanese side does not have an aircraft carrier arriving in Shantou, there are still a large number of planes bombing various places daily.

The Japanese troops in Chao'an failed to harass Fengxi on the 8th. The Japanese artillery stationed on Bijia Mountain and Hulu Mountain continuously shelled indiscriminately. More than half of the villages three or four miles away from the West Gate were destroyed by artillery shells. On the 9th, two Japanese planes flew low to reconnoiter the Anjie Road, and opened fire and dropped bombs in Tangkeng and Liuhuang, causing harassment all day long. Civilian losses were very heavy. On the same day, the head of the Japanese propaganda team was ambushed and killed by Chinese troops on the way back from Jinshi City to Guanchao. On the 10th, Japanese mountain troops entered Jinshi City, arrested and killed able-bodied men in retaliation. Eighteen innocent people were killed and their bodies were dumped in the creek, arousing public anger. Nearby strong men then took up arms and ambushed in Wuyang Mountain (next to the railway), launching an attack on Fuyang. At 11:00 AM, the mountain troops rushed back to support Fuyang City, and were intercepted by Chinese strong men while passing Qianjiang Garden beside the railway. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese security team also launched an attack from Shaxi, detouring to intercept the Japanese artillery. At this point, the Japanese troops could not respond to each other, and more than one hundred were killed. After suffering this unexpected loss, the Japanese troops returned to Fuyang to gather the remnants, of which only a little over one hundred remained. Goto, the commander of the Japanese troops stationed in Chao'an, then ordered that the guerrilla forces along the railway from Anbu, Yangwei, Shaxi, Jinshi, Yuntishan, and Fengxi be cleared by August 30. It was found that when the Japanese troops attacked Fengxi Yuntishan on the 8th, they suffered a rout and abandoned more than 30 corpses. Yuntishan is on the side of Anjie Road, 8 li from the railway. On the 11th, Goto sent three hundred infantry, cavalry, and motorcycle teams, and engaged in fierce fighting on the mountain for four hours. The Chinese troops, taking advantage of their high position, annihilated more than one hundred Japanese troops, and captured many mountain guns, machine guns, motorcycles, etc. The Japanese troops retreated to Fuyang and did not return to Chao'an. On the morning of the 12th, the Japanese troops assembled the Yamaki artillery and the Japanese puppet troops stationed in Caitang City and Anbu, and launched an attack on Sangpu Mountain. The first formation of six hundred men advanced from Guanchao, Caitang, and Fuyang, occupying Hong'an Township as a base, and launching a fierce attack on Shaxi. Eight cannons were used to bombard the Chinese army's position behind the creek. The Chinese side had only three hundred or so security regiments and strong men, who used machine guns to resist, advancing wave after wave. By 5:00 PM, the Japanese troops had suffered another 170 to 180 casualties, one cannon was destroyed, and two machine guns were destroyed. When the Japanese troops left, they abandoned a large amount of military supplies. The Chinese side also suffered considerable casualties. The Japanese troops suffered repeated defeats, and their morale was depressed. The Chinese army then attacked the northwest gate of Chao'an from Yixi and Fengxi. On the 14th, the artillery followed up and fired shells at the West Gate Station, destroying a Japanese military train. A battle for control took place near the outskirts of the city. The northwest gate of Chaozhou city had long been almost completely deserted. The Japanese troops moved fir wood and sandbags out of the city to build defenses and hold on to the death. The Chinese artillery fired accurately, advancing to the station in one fell swoop, annihilating more than one hundred Japanese troops. The Japanese troops then retreated into the city to hold firm, and dispatched eight planes to drop bombs in support. The Japanese artillery on Bijia Mountain fired continuously all day long. At about 3:00 AM on the 15th, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese headquarters on Hulu Mountain. The fighting lasted until dawn. Japanese reinforcements arrived by waterway and outflanked Fengxi from outside the South Gate. The Chinese army immediately dispersed and retreated. At the same time, more than 600 Japanese troops from Shantou Anbu attacked Shaxi again, in order to hold back the Chinese army from attacking Chao'an City, and when the Chinese army retreated, the Japanese troops desperately pursued them to the foot of Sangpu Mountain. At noon, in the winding mountain paths, they were surrounded by the Chinese army again. The Japanese troops were suddenly panicked. The Chinese troops on the mountain took the opportunity to carry out a sweeping attack, annihilating more than one hundred Japanese troops again. The Japanese troops finally retreated back to Caitang City, but they were still tense and claimed that they would attack Jieyang. Due to the repeated defeats in recent days, they vented their anger on the strong men of various villages, and sent puppet troops to search and arrest them in the villages, causing great chaos.

### The German Ex-Emperor's Hatred of England and Japan: Is Hitler Following in His Footsteps? A Secret 30-Year-Old Historical Account Sheds Light on Today's Situation (Translated from the New York Times Magazine)

Today's German leader is a staunch advocate of the Nordic race as superior to all others in the world. Hitler uses this philosophy as the core of his bold and great program. For six years, he has diligently rebuilt a nation that was defeated and divided twenty years ago, and has promoted and enhanced it. However, in the name of the Nordic white race, he has gained power and built his country, establishing two major axes: one is the Latin race of Italy, and the other is the yellow race of Japan. Mr. Hitler has completed a comprehensive military alliance with Italy, and has repeatedly tried to form a similar alliance with Japan, which is still in progress.

Generally speaking, Mr. Hitler's program is not new. Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany had already laid its foundation when he started the war in 1914. The Emperor also dreamed of vast sovereignty, intending to dominate Eastern and Central Europe, hating England as an obstacle, trying to break through the "encirclement," believing in the power of land and sea forces, indulging in power politics, and worshiping the idol of Teutonic hegemony. However, the Kaiser, who is now living in exile in Doorn, Netherlands, shakes his head whenever he hears people mention the Axis powers and Mr. Hitler's program. The Kaiser despises the British, but admits to hating the Japanese, and does not trust them, calling them "devils" and constantly remembering the "Yellow Peril." The Kaiser also believes that Hitler cannot obtain the expected assistance from Italy. Thirty-one years ago today, the Kaiser met with Mr. Hale, a reporter from the New York Times, for two hours, expressing this sentiment. His remarks were very harsh, stemming from anger and revealing obvious ambitions. However, this statement was never published in the newspaper. If it had been published at the time, the World War might have started six years earlier. This interview was not made public at the request of the German Foreign Ministry, the request of President Roosevelt, and the decision of the responsible reporter of the New York Times.

This interview contains letters, official documents, and memoranda, stored in the New York Times library for thirty-one years. Recently, it was discovered while sorting out other manuscripts. Its content can serve as historical material, and can show the fundamental differences in the psychology of the two leaders who were obsessed with German hegemony. Therefore, it is specially presented to the readers.

In the dramatic changes of the past ten years, we often forget the events in Europe in the ten years before 1914. We do not know that at that time, just as today, heroes competed, and there were moments that could erupt at any time.

Wilhelm II succeeded his father in 1888 at the age of 29. He was ambitious, arrogant, and disagreed with the Iron Chancellor Bismarck. In less than two years, Bismarck resigned in anger, and Wilhelm II took control of German policy. Bismarck had cautiously woven a network of treaties to isolate France and ensure that Germany could exercise military control over Europe. After Bismarck left, the Kaiser almost immediately alienated Russia, and soon alienated England. As a result, the two countries allied with France, and Bismarck's painstaking efforts were defeated. The Kaiser then dreamed of overseas colonies, and used interference in the South African Boer War to achieve his ambitions. He then occupied Jiaozhou in China, making it a naval base and a trade center. In 1898, he continued to threaten the United States, and there was a possibility of conflict in Manila. Soon, he acquired a cluster of islands in the Philippine region, and in 1899, he obtained two islands at the Samoa Conference. The Kaiser also engaged in building a navy.

England had a vast colonial empire, with a huge amount of annual overseas trade. Its power in China was growing, and it also held power in the Near East. Since 1874, Germany had gradually become a commercial power, and its position in world trade was second only to England. The Kaiser and the Pan-German League turned their eyes eastward and stared at the 16 million people of German descent outside the empire. Central Europe became the focus of their ambitions. They drafted an eastward plan, thinking of extending German power along the Danube River to the Turkish Empire. The Berlin-Baghdad Railway was its symbol. England saw it and was jealous, so it allied with France and Russia to obstruct it, fearing that Germany's trade power would grow and its political power would expand accordingly. The Kaiser then shouted, "Encirclement!" "Encirclement!" and engaged in expanding his naval program. England therefore suggested limiting the navy and signed a treaty with Japan. The Kaiser then declared that he would rather fight a war than accept England's command. This was the general situation in the early summer of 1908.

At that time, the US President was Mr. Roosevelt. Mr. Hale, a special reporter for the New York Times, was ordered to go to Washington and stay with Mr. Roosevelt for a week, writing several articles about Mr. Roosevelt's daily life. Later, in June, he was ordered to go to Europe to see if he could write articles about the Kaiser's daily life. He was a minister who had entered the journalism field, serving as a reporter and correspondent for several major newspapers, and was familiar with European affairs. In early July, after arriving in Germany, he learned that he could not write articles about the Kaiser's daily life, but he could be granted an interview with him. Because the Kaiser was going to Norway for his annual sea voyage, he followed him to Bergen and was introduced to the Kaiser on his yacht on July 18 by his friend General Löwenfeld, the commander of the Prussian Guard Corps, for a two-hour conversation.

Mr. Hale then wrote to Mr. Leach, an executive of the New York Times: "Last night, I was granted a special privilege by the Emperor to board his yacht and talk for two hours. The Emperor hates England very much and talked freely about the Yellow Peril. The Emperor said: 'England is a traitor to the white race. It will lose its colonies because of its treaty with Japan. The invitation of our fleet to visit New Zealand and Australia is to show England that these two colonies are managed for the sake of the white race and cannot serve the rebellious mother country.' The Emperor also said that he was sure that Japan was now inciting India to rise up against England, and the incident would occur within six months. Germany will cooperate with the United States to solve the Eastern problem. He and President Roosevelt have agreed to befriend China, so that China recognizes them as friends, in order to divide the East and make them hate each other. Negotiations are currently underway, and a senior Chinese official will come to the United States and Germany in a few months. The conditions will be announced and will guarantee China's integrity and open door. The world now knows that Russia is fighting for the white race, and it is fighting this war with great difficulty. It is a pity that its troops have no chance to attack the Japanese. If Japan gains control of China, Europe will be the first to suffer. He is now contacting the Muslim world, and he has supplied them with rifles, because they are brave in battle and their position is in the middle of East Asia, which can defeat the vanguard of the attacking army. Japan and the United States will fight each other within ten years.' The Emperor said a lot, I apologize for not recording it all. This matter is of utmost importance, without a doubt. I know it very well, so I am now going to Berlin, so that if the German Foreign Ministry wants to object before the publication, it can do so. At the same time, I believe that the Emperor is eager to express what he wants to express, and wants me to talk to him freely about everything. He usually hears very little, only through the courtiers around him. I feel that the Foreign Ministry will object to the publication, but I will do everything I can in Berlin. Now I expect Germany to fight a war with England. In my judgment, the Emperor does not mind the rapid outbreak of war. He uttered insults against England, endlessly, for two hours."

This letter, even if called an excerpt of Mr. Hale's record, is very勉强. The record shows the Emperor's direction of conversation and his emotional excitement. Mr. Hale said in the preface to his memorandum: "Even this is only a rough outline of what the Emperor said. The Emperor's mind is most focused on the new Anglo-Japanese treaty."

The Kaiser said: "Everyone understands what will happen between Asia and the West, that is, between the yellow race and the white race." If we are blind to this inevitable event, it is foolish. We have the sacred responsibility to maintain the civilization created by our ancestors for us, and the religion given to us by God. If we ignore it, we cannot face our ancestors or God. The whole world knows that the greatest crisis in the fate of the people of the earth is near at hand. The First World War has already taken place, but unfortunately it was not victorious. Russia fought for the white race. Many people did not know it at the time, but now everyone knows it. It is a pity that it could not fight a better battle. What a misfortune! God! I have always wished that my troops had the opportunity to engage in this battle and attack the Japanese army. We can win the victory in a short period of time.

What can harm us is not Japan, but Japan, which has become the leader of a united Asia. If Japan rules China, its threat to the world will be unimaginable, because that country hates white civilization. If we divide the East and make them hate each other, we are wise. At this stage, we must not allow China and Japan to unite with each other, or be close to each other, or for this country to engulf that country. The special responsibility that white people bear at this time is to prevent Japan from annexing China.

Great Britain is not worth mentioning. England is a traitor to the white race. Now a group of fools hold the government and are in an absolutely untenable position. I tell you now that the British Empire will be shattered on this reef. If England insists on its alliance with Japan, I do not know how the British Empire can avoid division. Private interests have entered through the door, and passionate patriotism has flown out of the window. I know that British Columbia has clearly stated that it must now govern the area with very mild measures. Otherwise, I will declare independence from England, and then everyone will know that the racial problem there is very critical. The situation in India at this time has openly shown its hatred of the British. If the Indians know the whole truth, their attitude towards the British will be more than just hatred. The special danger of India is directly due to the British government's alliance with Japan. The British government has taken this step, exchanging the quality words of dignity and friendship with an Asian nation on an equal footing, while forcing another Asian nation to be its slaves. India has long complained against England. Now this complaint has been used as an argument to incite the fierce spirit of rebellion against England.

I tell you now that I do not believe that England sincerely supports this treaty, but the fools who run the government are determined to maintain it. As long as England maintains this treaty, it cannot escape the position of betraying the white race."

Emperor Wilhelm also said that England's allies, France and Russia, were not reliable in helping to contain Japan. For this reason, the Emperor announced that only Germany and the United States could handle this task. Therefore, the Emperor spoke at length about the various reasons why Germany and the United States should strengthen their friendship.

The Emperor said in the meantime: "You once told me that a huge number of Germans, and men and women of German descent, are now a large part of the citizens of your great country. This has become a necessary unity between the two countries. We have the same temperament, the same religion, and the same race. Today, even in the nightmares of the agitators, we can no longer imagine the slightest shadow of conflict between us, or this possibility. Germany has no ambition to pass through, or even approach the scope of activities of the United States. Alas! Everything will eventually be realized. The future of the world belongs to the white race, not to the yellow race, the black race, or the brown race. It belongs to those with white skin and blond hair, to Christianity, to Protestants. Only our nation can save it. No other civilization or any other religion has the right to save mankind. The future belongs to us - the Anglo-Saxons, that is, those from Northern Europe."

The Kaiser then spoke of President Roosevelt, expressing his warm admiration for the American president, calling him one who possesses the most beautiful spirit of a new world. He then expounded his political philosophy, saying: "Everything in the world is often done by one person, that is, a person with a firm character. History in times of crisis often calls out one person. Everything awaits the appearance of a great man. Until a person rises up, a person with a burning belief in his heart, with a spirit of great fearlessness, not caring about being laughed at or misunderstood, nothing will happen. That person knows what he wants, and once he knows it, he will advance boldly to achieve it. ... This is the path of history. A great man has the power to accomplish everything. This is the law of social progress. I have told my people not to calculate whether it is an empire or a republic, but to have one person shoulder the heavy responsibility. The Congress can make criticisms, the Congress can not allow it, the Congress may even be wise, but the Congress does not do things. You can recruit the most knowledgeable people in the world into a chamber of Congress, but you can never get any action from a chamber of Congress. There must be one person to lead before you can." He then praised Roosevelt's personality and career, and said that the British nobles did not know him, and hated him very much, even the British king could not avoid it.

The Kaiser also mentioned pacifism and religion: "In the real world of facts, we must fight for the right path. The Bible is full of battles, and some of them are even wonderful. It is a misunderstanding to say that Christianity does not advocate war. Has Christianity ever opposed all wars? Early Christians did not hesitate to use swords to spread their faith. We ourselves were forced to convert. I am not advocating that we still use this method today, but how can our missionaries reach the savage lands if we do not win and, when necessary, use force to maintain the opening of the road for our priests? I tell you, our religion requires us to use all our power and talents, that is, our knowledge, our science, our tactics."

This record did not mention Mr. Hale's statement in his letter that the German Emperor detailed the supply of guns to Muslims, but only listed the German Emperor's ridicule of England and his anger at England's contempt for Germany's great desire to be an official.

(Translator's note: The following details the situation in which this interview was prevented from being published by the German Foreign Ministry, omitted.)

Mr. Hale later returned to the United States and visited President Roosevelt on August 12. Mr. Roosevelt listened quietly to Mr. Hale's report of everything, and was very happy that the German Emperor praised him, but he was very surprised by some of it, and firmly denied that the German Emperor had agreed to interfere in the East. Mr. Hale's memorandum, along with letters, telegrams, and reports of his meeting with President Roosevelt, are stored in the New York Times. This matter seems to have ended. However, later, because the newspaper slightly revealed this matter, it caused a disturbance in Europe for a while. After the German Foreign Ministry firmly denied it, it was restored to peace. However, the German Emperor's policy remained unchanged, and he diligently engaged in naval competition, believing that England had entered a bad fate, and more importantly, doubting that England would help France or Russia fight. Many people believe that the German Emperor's feelings contributed to the great outbreak in Europe in August 1914. It was too late when England announced that if the German army invaded Belgium and France, it would fight, because the German army had already begun to invade. The "fools" of England bore the blame. Five years later, these "fools" formulated the Treaty of Versailles, and the German Emperor lived in Doorn, Netherlands. Today, the new Great Germany that the German Emperor dreamed of building is ruled by an Austrian who was once a nameless sergeant in the German army. Everything still follows in the footsteps of the German Emperor and fulfills his ambitions. The only differences are two points: one is to hate Christianity, which the German Emperor respected, and the other is to befriend the Japanese, whom the German Emperor hated. Hitler not only concluded the Berlin-Tokyo Axis with Japan, but also helped Japan fight against China. The German Emperor once said firmly, "We must prevent Japan from annexing China." Today, Berlin does not even hear a weak reaction to this.

Translator's note: Hitler recently abandoned Japan and concluded a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, and the Berlin-Tokyo Axis was broken because of this. Although this move by Mr. Hitler cannot be said to be following in the footsteps of the German Emperor and severing ties with Japan, at least it has changed the policy of being pro-Japanese. The German Emperor brought trouble on himself because of his excessive ambition, but his remarks about Japan are of undeniable value. As for Japan, having lost its ambition in Germany, it may restore its old relationship with England. This has already been revealed in its words and deeds. England also does not want to break up with Japan suddenly. Recently, despite all the efforts to oppose the extradition of the four suspects in the Tianjin assassination of Cheng, England still did not want to offend Japan because of this and rejected it. Therefore, there is a great possibility that England and Japan will restore their old friendship. This will inevitably be condemned by the deposed German Emperor again.

### The Chinese Army at the Fairy Maiden Temple Stormed into the Japanese Camp: They Attacked Twice and Killed Many. The Japanese Commander Fled to Nanjing in Panic.

Yangzhou Dispatch: A guerrilla unit of a certain Chinese army sent a commando team and a special operations team to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese army at the Fairy Maiden Temple on the evening of the 13th. A squad of the commando team took advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness and entered the Japanese army headquarters in the town, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. In the dark night, dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed. Then the Japanese army surrounded and strafed them with fierce machine guns, so the commando team could not rush out and all made heroic sacrifices. However, the Chinese special operations team continued to guard to the Japanese army headquarters. The Japanese army responded in panic, and the two sides engaged in close combat, fighting bloodily all night. The special operations team also died in battle, with more than fifty casualties. The Japanese side also suffered many casualties. Limbs and broken arms were everywhere. After suffering this major setback, the Japanese army's vigor was greatly reduced. The Chinese army returned to defense and reorganized at dawn on the 14th, taking a short rest, and then planned to attack again. However, since then, in order to prevent the Chinese army from attacking, the Japanese army has transferred forty or fifty Japanese and puppet troops from Yang to the Fairy Maiden Temple for assistance every afternoon after 4 pm. At dawn, they returned to Yangzhou. They also transported more than a hundred shells to the Fairy Maiden Temple on the evening of the 15th, and set up two steel cannons and two large cannons on the South Beach. At night, they sent sentries on the roof of the Japanese army headquarters, using searchlights, and using telescopes during the day. If there was any impact, they would fire without a target. Their fear and panic can be seen. The Japanese army commander, Gui Ban, who was entrenched in the Fairy Maiden Temple, panicked after being attacked by the Chinese army. On the afternoon of the 15th, he took a car to Yang and went to Nanjing the next morning to ask for instructions.

After the Chinese government decided to fully support the legal tender and foreign exchange, the basis is sound and the whole country is stable. The black market foreign exchange is insufficient to represent the status of the legal tender. The financial markets in the interior have all entered the right track. In addition, measures are being taken to stop speculation and prevent capital flight. The details are recorded as follows:

Speculation Creates Shanghai Black Market

The sharp contraction of the Shanghai foreign exchange black market exchange rate is entirely caused by speculators and has long been unable to represent China's true external purchasing power. Today's foreign exchange buyers in Shanghai are: (1) Japanese merchants use legal tender obtained from dumping Japanese goods in Shanghai to purchase foreign exchange, (2) Japanese puppets exchange legal tender with Japanese military tickets and vouchers such as "Huaxing" and "Hualian" to obtain foreign exchange, (3) Shanghai Chinese and foreign merchants import foreign goods and need foreign exchange, (4) foreign exchange speculation merchants in Tianjin, Hong Kong and other places, (5) foreign exchange speculation trading by wealthy people in Shanghai. Except for the third item of foreign exchange needed for importing goods, which can still be regarded as legitimate, the rest are not related to China's war of resistance economy and have direct damage.

Insufficient to Represent the Status of the Legal Tender

The foreign exchange rate is a representative of a country's currency value, so China is determined to fully stabilize the foreign exchange rate and has established a Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee to handle it. Today, the statutory price of foreign exchange has remained stable, while the Shanghai foreign exchange black market exchange rate is insufficient to represent the status of the legal tender. Because the economic foundation of China's war of resistance is already in the southwestern and northwestern provinces, the economy of North China and Central China cannot be directly used by the Chinese government. For example, foreign goods dumping and exports are subject to control, and there are so-called "Huaxing" and "Lianquan" vouchers. The customs under their jurisdiction have been plundered. Luxury goods and non-essential goods can still be imported. The foreign exchange obtained from the export of local goods is not sold to the Chinese government.

The Legal Tender Itself Has a Sound Basis

The sharp decline of the Shanghai black market foreign exchange cannot be attributed to the status of the legal tender itself. Because the legal tender's cash reserve is still above 44%, which proves that the economic basis of the legal tender itself is very sound. In principle, the legal tender can never constitute a black market decline. However, the reason why the black market is constituted today is due to the special economy of the occupied areas. As for the main force of the fluctuations in the Shanghai foreign exchange black market, one is the bill market, the other is the foreign currency trading market, and the third is the gold market. The maintenance of the bill market is based on banks, the foreign currency market is mainly based on exchange shops, and the whole city is mainly based on money changers and silver shops.

Stop Speculation and Prevent Escape

In order to prevent the escape of funds, the Chinese government first announced concrete measures to stabilize finance, second, controlled foreign exchange and handled application matters, third, restricted withdrawal methods, fourth, allowed the remittance of banknotes from Tianjin, Shandong and Hanzhou to the mainland to prevent the acquisition of foreign exchange, and fifth, established a domestic remittance management committee to restrict remittances. The above five items are important methods to prevent foreign exchange speculation and capital flight. The Shanghai silver and money industry, in order to understand the government's intentions, unanimously complied. They also made every effort to encourage the internal transfer of funds to assist the government in completing the mission of building the southwest and northwest regions.

The Financial Market in the Interior is on the Right Track

The financial market in the interior is also on the right track due to the effective cooperation between government banks and local financial authorities. As for external purchasing power, the exchange of goods controlled by the government for export, the loans from friendly countries, and the inherent foreign exchange holdings, the Chinese government's external purchasing power has remained as usual since the war of resistance. The sharp contraction of the Shanghai black market foreign exchange is beneficial to the Chinese economy (1) reducing the import of non-essential goods, (2) making it impossible for those who acquire foreign exchange to use their skills. Although the issuance of legal tender after the war has increased, the cash reserves are still sufficient, proving that the Chinese government has never begged for a paper money policy, and the currency during the war has not inflated. The increase in prices in various places is due to the excess of demand over supply and the lack of sources, not due to the increase in currency.

### Statistics on Gold and Silver Imports and Exports: Export Surplus

The Customs announced the import and export value statistics of gold and silver for July this year. There were no imports of gold coins, raw gold, silver coins, or raw silver. Exports of raw gold totaled 44,702 gold, silver coins 468,755 yuan, and raw silver 1,411 yuan. As for imports from January to July, there were 168 gold and 824 silver. Exports were 1,324,887 gold and 1,891,423 silver.

### Shanghai British Authorities Have Made Necessary Preparations So That They Can Cope Calmly with the Outbreak of the European War; Male Registration or Possible Evacuation

The Shanghai Times reports that while there is no reason for panic among the foreign residents of Shanghai at present, if the serious European situation escalates into war, preparations and emergency measures must be taken here as in other parts of the world. Therefore, the British Army, Navy, and consular authorities have taken certain steps to prepare for any eventuality. The British warship HMS Cornwall, carrying Rear Admiral Mowatt, commander of the 5th Cruiser Squadron, suddenly set sail just after 6:00 PM on Friday. Naval authorities here claim that the ship is sailing to Weihaiwei, but many believe that the cruiser is heading to Hong Kong.

Two British Army Units Ordered to Prepare

There is also good reason to believe that the two British Army regiments currently stationed in Shanghai have been making military preparations for the past three days. It is reported that both the British East Surrey Regiment and the West Yorkshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's Own) are fully equipped and ready to move out immediately upon receipt of orders. If Europe avoids war and there is no need for the British troops to leave Shanghai, the current plan is to conduct the usual rotation of the West Yorkshire Regiment and the East Surrey Regiment in November, transporting them to Hong Kong and India on the British troopship Dilwara.

British Male Residents Must Register

However, military authorities claim that these plans are constantly subject to change depending on the situation between Britain and Europe. It has been decided that the West Yorkshire Regiment will be stationed in India, while the East Surrey Regiment will be transferred to Hong Kong to replace the Scottish regiment. The British Consulate has issued a new notice requesting British male residents who have not yet received a voluntary national service application form and wish to register to apply to the passport department of the British Consulate General for inclusion in the register of British men volunteering for service. Yesterday (the 26th), many British people were seen at the British Consulate applying for forms.

Considerable Doubt About How to Evacuate

After the departure of HMS Cornwall, the only British warships remaining in port are the gunboats Cricket and Gnat, and the destroyer HMS Duncan. News that Hong Kong is preparing to evacuate women and children to Manila has caused anxiety among many foreign residents in Shanghai, and they are very hesitant about whether they will be evacuated in the event of war and where they will be evacuated to. According to them, when war broke out in this port two years ago, they were sent to Hong Kong, but now it has been decided that even the women and children of Hong Kong will be evacuated to Manila, and the women and children of Shanghai are uncertain about where they will go.

Although Preparations Have Been Made, It Is Still Not Necessary

From the appearances, there is still no need to evacuate the women and children of Shanghai, but it is heard from reliable sources that the British authorities have made all necessary preparations to take this step in an emergency. The North China Daily News also reports that due to a misunderstanding, it was reported on Saturday that all British men and women in Shanghai must register with the British Consulate for voluntary national service. This statement is not correct. British women do not need to register, but those who wish to serve as nurses, or British women with nursing experience, should register with the British Women's Association.

### Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Chongqing, Arousing Public Resolve; The Cruel Propaganda of Japan Has Indeed Achieved Results; Every Bombing Has No Specific Target

Foreign Reporter in Shanghai Speaks Freely About Everything

The Continental Daily News reports that a foreign journalist who has lived in the wartime capital of Chongqing for more than a year arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 26th). According to him, since several months ago, Japanese planes have repeatedly bombed Chongqing, and the characteristic of these bombings is "absolutely indiscriminate." The Japanese plan for bombing Chongqing follows only two paths. The first path, which has failed, is to try to raze Chongqing to the ground and eliminate public morale through terror. The second path, which is still in progress, is to destroy the new residential areas of the city where many foreign embassies are located, hoping to kill Chinese officials and affect the activities of the central government. Since government offices are clearly no longer in the city, the Japanese are following this path. The reporter firmly stated that he had never seen Japanese planes hit a

Specific Target

Such as military or similar facilities. Japanese planes only drop large numbers of bombs in the two main districts of Chongqing itself and in the residential areas outside the city. Japanese bombers fly over the area in flocks, in a V-shaped formation, and systematically drop bombs, bombing everything within the fan-shaped formation without seeking any specific target. One of the main roads in Chongqing's commercial district, where there are no military facilities, has been repeatedly hit by Japanese planes indiscriminately dropping bombs from west to east. It is heard that Japanese pilots wait

Until Dusk Before Bombing Chongqing

Then they fly to Hechuan City, where the northwest waters of Chongqing meet, and soar endlessly, sometimes bombing it as well. They wait until the sky is almost completely dark, and then fly directly to Chongqing, a distance of only five minutes. This gives the Japanese planes two advantages: first, it is not easy for anti-aircraft guns and Chinese fighter planes to detect enemy planes in the dark sky; second, when Japanese planes enter Chongqing from Hechuan, they are already flying back towards their point of departure. The reporter went on to say that Chongqing was subjected to a night attack, and because he did not take shelter in an air-raid shelter, he was able to

Witness the Japanese Attack

According to him, there is telephone communication upstream of the Yangtze River to give advance warning of the movements of Japanese planes. Chongqing issues an initial air-raid warning at least one hour before the enemy planes arrive. As the Japanese planes fly closer, Chongqing becomes slightly disturbed, and then becomes silent to wait. Ships in the river quickly carry passengers to the safer south bank, while others with ample air-raid experience take shelter in nearby air-raid shelters. These air-raid shelters are carved out of the solid rock beneath Chongqing, and there are now enough air-raid shelters to accommodate the entire population of Chongqing, 100,000 people. At the same time, twenty or thirty Chinese fighter planes are divided into

Small Squadrons to Take Off

And fly around the suburbs to form an aerial defense line, so that the center of Chongqing can use anti-aircraft guns without obstruction. Fifteen minutes after the emergency warning is issued, twenty-seven Japanese bombers fly in formation. Because of the fierce bombardment of anti-aircraft guns and the active interception of fighter planes, the attack time is shorter. After the Japanese planes escape and the alarm is lifted, rescue work begins. Military police, ambulances, and first-aid workers go back and forth on the roads. Within fifteen minutes,

There Is No Rubble on the Roads

Fires are also being put out. The power to the bombed area has been cut off, and there is busy repair of the damaged power lines. The next day, Chongqing has returned to normal, and water and electricity have been repaired. This speed and effectiveness comes from experience, but it is inspired by the fact that every bomb dropped by Japanese planes on civilian areas is accompanied by propaganda. This inspiration has prompted the Chinese people to unite and fight hard against the aggressor who uses bombs to slaughter countless innocent people, destroy their homes, and destroy

The Expectation of Peaceful Living and Working

Of course, this is cruel propaganda, but during his time in Sichuan, he has seen this propaganda achieve the above-mentioned effect. The entire province of Sichuan has become an enthusiastic supporter of the war of resistance. Wherever bombs fall in China, there is no defeatist sentiment. There is only the excellent determination to follow the Chairman and continue the war of resistance until the invaders surrender.

### Japanese Troops Invade Punam in Six Routes; Chinese Troops Fight Heroically; Japanese Artillery Covers the Infantry's More Than Ten Invasions; After a Day-Long Stalemate, They Were All Repelled by the Chinese Troops

It is reported that the Japanese troops are using new reinforcements from Japan via Shanghai to invade the guerrilla areas in the suburbs of Shanghai, and the Chinese troops in the suburbs have also begun a counter-sweeping war, so the guerrilla war in the four suburbs has become active again in recent days. According to information from merchants in Punam, a startling and heroic guerrilla war took place in Punam the day before yesterday. Six hundred Japanese troops set out from Shanghai to Punam. At about 4:00 AM on that day, they divided their troops into six routes from Nanjiao, Zhanggang, Qingcun Port, Xu Jiaqiao, Xin Chang Hangtou, and other towns, with more than 100 Japanese troops on each route, and invaded Taozhai near Qingcun Port, carrying a large number of machine guns and small steel cannons to carry out the so-called "sweeping war." At that time, a certain brigade of the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army received information in advance and was ready to defend the area with a strong defense. A fierce battle unfolded. The Japanese troops used small steel cannons to bombard and cover their infantry's invasion, which was carried out dozens of times, but was repelled by the guerrillas with machine guns. There were three hand-to-hand battles, and the fighting between the two sides was extremely fierce. Starting in the early morning, the stalemate lasted until about 10:00 PM that night, when the guerrillas used night warfare to repel the invading Japanese troops. Both sides suffered considerable casualties in this battle, and it is heard that the brigade commander Li of that unit has been promoted to detachment commander by the Chinese military authorities.

Japanese Troops Invade Qin Gong Tang East

The Japanese Zuehong unit of the Japanese army in Chuansha, Pudong, guided by the puppet "army" of Xu Hongfa, set out from Zhuqiao Town at the end of Shangchuan Road and invaded the guerrilla base east of Qin Gong Tang. A certain officer of a certain platoon's communications office was no match for the enemy alone and was stabbed to death and sacrificed for the country. The Japanese and puppet troops searched for a large guerrilla team but did not find them, and were afraid of being ambushed, so they quickly retreated to Zhuqiao.

Both Sides Used Machine Guns to Strafe

Unexpectedly, that night, a large guerrilla force advanced towards Zhuqiao, surrounding and attacking from three sides, with a very fierce momentum. Both sides used machine guns to strafe, and the Japanese troops frequently opened small steel cannons to show their power. The Chinese troops avoided the artillery fire and crawled forward. The two sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Because there were only thirty or forty Japanese troops stationed in the town, and more than a hundred puppet "troops" who had no combat power, they abandoned Zhuqiao and retreated in a panic under the encirclement of five or six hundred Chinese troops.

Japanese Troops Fled Westward, Zhuqiao Recovered

They were planning to retreat to Chuansha, and on the way, they passed Dengjia Wharf and Jiangzhenwen, and were intercepted by guerrillas, who attacked from both sides, causing many casualties. They fled wildly to the west, without distinguishing directions, running and escaping in disorder. The Chinese troops pursued closely from behind until dawn before giving up. One part of the defeated soldiers, covered in mud, actually fled to the towns of Le'an Town, Tangmu Bridge, and Zhangjiangzhai on the border of Nanchuan. The Chinese troops won a great victory in this battle, and Zhuqiao Town was also recovered.

### Lawyer Yue Junwei Suggests Raising Funds to Exchange Postage Stamps; The Refusal to Use Postage Stamps Greatly Affects the Common People; Appeals to All Sectors to Raise Funds to Exchange Them to Provide Relief

Lawyer Yue Junwei, in addition to practicing law on weekdays, is also enthusiastic about public welfare. Recently, in order to provide relief to the common people and exchange postage stamps for cash, he has made a special suggestion to all sectors. The original text is recorded as follows: Since the lack of copper coins, postage stamps have been used instead, which is a remedy for the inconvenience of circulation in the market and transactions. Recently, due to the publication of the imminent issuance of fractional banknotes, the postage stamps used as substitutes have suddenly been announced to be no longer in use, which is justified in principle, but has a

Profound Impact on the Livelihood of the Common People

Those who trade in fractional currency most frequently are vendors and peddlers, who are definitely ordinary people. The livelihood of these people depends on their daily hard-earned income. Once they don't, they may face hunger for a day. If they hide the postage stamps they have earned, and they are suddenly refused for use in the market, there is no way to sell them, and there is no need to send letters, and even those who use them as a daily

Selling Capital

What a serious impact on their livelihood! The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has realized this and proposed three measures, and has appealed to the postal authorities for relief, but the post office has only accepted the proposal to allow the use of postage stamps with leniency, and has not agreed to exchange and recover them, because it is restricted by laws and regulations. This matter is currently awaiting instructions from the highest authorities. Now,

What I Suggest

If the postal authorities do not allow the exchange, the public organizations in this city can organize a relief postage stamp exchange committee to solicit donations from various businesses and individuals, purchase postage stamps, pre-determine the amount, pay the money in advance, and give receipts. After the funds have been collected to a certain amount, a public announcement will be made to exchange the postage stamps, and the

Postage Stamps Obtained Through Exchange

Will be used to repay those who were solicited with receipts. In this way, those who are solicited will still get postage stamps of equal value, and will not lose anything, while ordinary people can exchange the unnecessary postage stamps for legal tender, which is of great benefit. In addition to donating 100 yuan to the relief postage stamp exchange committee for expenses, I will also purchase 200 yuan of postage stamps. This matter concerns the relief of the common people and the creation of benefits for society. In the spirit of "many hands make light work" and "common boat, common cause," I offer my humble opinion and hope that all sectors will consider it and give instructions. Suggested by Lawyer Yue Junwei.

### Employees of China Match Factory Request Pay Raise; The Factory Refuses

The Daguang News Agency reports that the China Match Factory in West Shanghai is large in scale and produces many products. All the employees of the factory, due to the soaring prices and insufficient income, have elected representatives and written letters to the management, requesting a reasonable pay raise. However, the management insisted on the originally set salary and refused the request, and even planned to dismiss the representatives. Upon hearing the news, all the employees are discussing countermeasures and will issue a letter to people from all walks of life, appealing for help.

### Yesterday Was Confucius' Birthday; Flags Were Hung to Celebrate; The Ministry of Education Stipulated It as Teachers' Day; Schools Will Hold Supplementary Ceremonies This Morning

All sectors of the city commemorated Confucius' birthday yesterday, and it was one of the eight days of the year agreed upon by various groups and the authorities of the two concessions to hang flags. Therefore, all major companies, shops, and schools hung flags uniformly yesterday morning to express their celebration. Qingbai flags were hung everywhere, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. All agencies in the city, such as post offices, courts, customs, and schools, were closed as usual. Silver and money businesses and member banks and villages will take a day off today in accordance with the regulations of the guild, but the Central Bank will still work as usual and will not take a day off. The education sector also expressed warm celebrations because yesterday's Confucius' birthday was also the first Teachers' Day stipulated by the Ministry of Education. However, because it was a weekly holiday, no form of ceremony was held. Schools will hold supplementary ceremonies at this morning's commemorative week meeting, and will elaborate on the deeds and theories of Confucius, and the great achievements of his major contributions to the history of Chinese culture, so that students can generally understand the virtues of the sage and use them as a model, and even more, in this extraordinary period, the responsibility of teachers is great, and they should encourage and strive together to build a spiritual fortress, so as to promote national strength.

### The US Warship Marblehead Sailed to North China; For Routine Patrol Work; Hultman's Fast Warship Sailed to the Yangtze River

The US Asiatic Fleet light cruiser "Marblehead" came to Shanghai from Qingdao on the 24th to purchase supplies and is about to complete its mission. According to US Navy Department news, "Marblehead" will leave Shanghai for North China at the end of this month to carry out routine patrol work. US Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Hultman's personal fast warship "Isabel" sailed out of the naval dock on the 25th for sea trials. It was originally planned to sail directly to North China to listen to orders. It is now known that the fast warship has changed its itinerary and will sail to various ports along the Yangtze River within days, so that the commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, General Glassford, can meet in Wuhu. According to US Navy news on the evening of the 26th, the US Navy Department's three-in-one tank battleship "Charlotte" may visit Shanghai at the end of September. US fourth naval officers had previously been transferred to Qinhuangdao, Qingdao, and other places for summer exercises. It is now known that the summer exercises will soon be completed. The US fourth naval personnel who are training in North China will soon return to Shanghai to rejoin the team.

### Ordering Foreign Rice; Continued Registration; The Rice Market Was Closed Yesterday; Rice Prices Are Expected to Fall Today

The Accountants Association has been accepting the entrustment to handle the registration of foreign rice orders. Although yesterday was Sunday and Confucius' birthday, it was still open for business as usual. Those who went to register included the Money Industry Guild (750 bags) and the Family Industry Society (80 bags), totaling 830 bags. Together with the 800 bags registered in the previous two days, the total is 1,630 bags. The initiators of the association plan to order from foreign firms as soon as a considerable number has been collected, so as to ship them to Shanghai as soon as possible to replenish the reserves and curb market prices. Yesterday was a Sunday holiday, and the rice market and management committee were closed for one day, so there was no market for rice prices all day. However, the arrival of goods from the river was more than in the earlier days due to the smooth negotiations of the authorities. The increase in the ordering of foreign rice has been realized, and people's hearts are more stable. It is expected that after the rice market opens today, rice prices are expected to continue to fall back.

### Agricultural Product Exports Can Receive Certificates of Origin; Trial Sales of Samples Do Not Require Certificates

The Federation of Malayan Chinese Chambers of Commerce made some suggestions regarding the Ministry of Economic Affairs' rules for issuing certificates of origin for domestic goods. The Ministry replied: It has been noted. The details mentioned are hereby resolved separately. (1) The rules for issuing certificates of origin for domestic goods stipulate that although they are limited to industrial products, agricultural product exports can still be certified by exporting merchants in accordance with the rules for issuing certificates of origin for goods, and there is no need to stipulate this in the original rules. (2) Regarding the request to issue export certificates free of charge, if it is a sample for trial sale, there is no need to apply for a certificate. For goods traded in complete shipments, fees should still be paid as usual. The above two items should be complied with. This reply.

### The Zhabei Han Bridge Is Blockaded

There was an old bridge west of the North Railway Station on Xinmin Road in Zhabei, which was an important road for residents in the inland area to travel to the concession. Therefore, it was very lively with pedestrians at ordinary times. Since Zhabei was occupied by Japanese soldiers, the section along the concession was blocked. The North Railway Station ticket office was changed to enter and exit from Qiujiang Road on the north side (between Gongxing Road and Huiwen Road). However, in order to facilitate the return of passengers from the News Bridge, this bridge was still open. Recently, various offices of the "Central China Railway Co., Ltd." have been built along the railway from Song Park Road via Wangjiazhai to Baoshan Road on the north side of the bridge. Moreover, fearing that guerrillas would mix in and cause obstacles, the bridge has recently been blocked. A wooden sign with the words "Central China Railway Co., Ltd." prohibiting passage has been erected at the end of the bridge, and there are also iron nets and other obstacles.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Line German Transports; All Suspended; European Situation Is Tense to Prevent Accidents; German Consulate General Ordered Suspension

The shipping department of the German merchant Lai He Foreign Company and the Far East Shipping Company in Shanghai recently received a notice from the German consulate that due to the tense situation in Europe, all German merchant ships should be temporarily suspended. Therefore, the Haifu temporarily suspended its voyage to Ningbo. As for the German merchant ships sailing on the Beisha Line, they still sailed as usual. The details are recorded as follows:

Shanghai-Ningbo German Transports; Ordered to Suspend

The German Consulate General in Shanghai, in order to avoid accidents for German merchants in the Far East Line due to the tense situation in Europe, recently notified the shipping department of the German merchant Lai He Foreign Company and the Far East Shipping Company in Shanghai, ordering all ships sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line to be temporarily suspended. After receiving the notice, the two companies immediately complied with it. As a result, the Lai He's Haifu Wheel, which was originally scheduled to start anchoring to Ningbo on the 26th, was temporarily announced to be suspended. The two German merchant ships, Moufu and Hana, are now anchored outside the mouth of Zhenhai. The company authorities have also telegraphed them separately, ordering them not to leave their current anchorage and to wait for the consulate's notice before deciding where to go. As for the remaining British and Italian merchant ships, such as the German Ping, Ende, Baoli, and Yingzhou, they all sail as usual without hindrance. Therefore, the Shanghai-Ningbo Line is still unobstructed.

Haifu Stranded in Shanghai; Destination Undecided

The Haifu Wheel of the shipping department of the German merchant Lai He Foreign Company had just been approved by the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters and was scheduled to start sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line at 5:00 PM on the 26th. The day before, the German consulate suddenly notified it, causing the temporary suspension of anchoring. According to the shipping department, the German Wheel's ability to set sail depends on how the European situation changes. Passengers who do not want to wait can apply to the company for a refund, but the company hopes to be able to set sail as soon as possible.

Downstream of the Yangtze River; German Transports Do Not Stop

In addition to the three ships, Moufu, etc., on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line, the German merchants currently sailing in China also have many ships sailing on the Beisha Line downstream of the Yangtze River, such as the Jiangding Wheel of the Tongxing Shipping Company, the Haikang Wheel of the Keli Shipping Company, and the Kaisideng Wheel of the Haibi Foreign Company. However, the companies of the above ships have not received orders from the German consulate to suspend sailing, so each ship sails as usual.

### The Four Banks' Discount and Loan Association Had Over 17 Million in Loans by the End of June; An Increase of 2.8 Million Yuan Compared to May

The Four Banks' Discount and Loan Association (Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank) continues to handle discounts and loans in order to regulate interbank finance and stabilize the market. As of the end of June, the balance of loans was 17.7 million yuan, of which 16 million yuan was directly released by the association, and the remainder was re-released by the Silver and Money Industry Preparation Association, an increase of 2.8 million yuan compared to May.

### The Municipal Council Hosts a Factory Safety Training Class

— Su Yi

Trainees Receive Free Instruction / Mechanics Are Encouraged to Participate Enthusiastically

The Industrial Division of the Public Concession's Municipal Council recently decided to hold a "Factory Industrial Knowledge and Safety Training Class," all to strive for industrial safety within the concession. Its purpose: to correct all errors in industry; to instill basic industrial knowledge; and to increase work efficiency. The training class is scheduled to begin teaching on September 1st, and trainees will receive free instruction.

Industrial safety is indeed very important. Although Shanghai has become an isolated island, the number of factories within the concession has increased compared to before the war, which is a fact. Everyone understands that improper operation of factory machinery can often cause great disasters. Not long ago, the Municipal Council held a "Safety First" campaign, emphasizing the practical aspect. Now, holding the industrial knowledge and safety training class also aligns with the purpose of this campaign. In order to understand some of the details of this training class, I specially took time to visit Professor Hu Yunsheng of Jiaotong University, who is the engineer designated by the Municipal Council. I asked him questions one by one, and he kindly provided clear answers despite his busy schedule.

A similar training class was held last year, and the trainees at that time were foremen in factory management, numbering over a hundred people. This time, it is the second session of the training class. However, the trainees in this session will start with the installation mechanics of manufacturing companies, and then proceed to train stokers. There have already been seven sessions of this type of stoker training in the past. This session's categories of training are more than in previous years, and the subjects taught are divided into: (1) the design of various steam boilers; (2) manufacturing steam boilers and improving past mistakes; (3) experimental welding engineering; (4) general knowledge and management of mechanical workshops; (5) mechanical installations and transmission of power; (6) experimental electrical engineering and its installation methods; (7) mechanical drawing. To explain the mechanical structure, a film projector is used to project images on the screen for easy understanding. The training period is a total of seventeen weeks, with one session each on Tuesdays and Fridays, from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM. The instructors in charge of teaching include Hu Yunsheng, Jin Zhixuan, Yan Liping, Huang Qiluo, etc. They are engineers approved by the Municipal Council, and their teaching is voluntary. Trainees who pass the training exam and do not miss classes in the middle will be issued a certificate by the Municipal Council as a form of encouragement.

Among the most important aspects of industrial safety, boilers should be given attention. If the boiler's inner chamber is not sturdy, and the stokers do not pay attention to the specified steam pressure usage, explosions can occur, resulting in casualties. Incidents like this happen several times a year. Before the war, a boiler in a certain bank's boiler room exploded, flying through the roof and collapsing the thick wall of a neighboring house. Fortunately, it happened in the early morning, so there were not many casualties! This kind of explosion is simply terrifying. The sudden occurrence is like a giant bomb dropped from the sky. To reduce the occurrence of this type of incident, the Industrial Division of the Municipal Council stipulated several years ago that factories with boilers must be inspected once a year. If any unsatisfactory points are discovered, the owners are instructed to hire workers to repair them. If it is already unqualified, it will be banned. In addition, regulations are set on the pounds of steam pressure to be used, so that the stokers remember them firmly.

According to Mr. Hu, the total number of boilers within the concession is currently estimated to be over 750, half of which have been added since May of last year to this year. The factories that use boilers the most are dyeing factories, weaving factories, and silk factories, most of which use them to drive prime movers. These factories have already started inspections. In addition, hotels and bathhouses also use boilers to generate steam and hot water, but inspections have not yet begun.

The engineers in charge of the inspection work are approved by the Municipal Council. Currently, there are nine Chinese engineers and more than ten Western engineers operating within the concession. After a thorough inspection by the engineers, they submit a report to the Industrial Division of the Municipal Council for record-keeping. It should be clarified here that the Industrial Division of the Municipal Council handles this procedure entirely as a service and does not charge any fees. As for the engineers, they charge a handling fee, with the inspection fee for ordinary boilers being 50 yuan per unit. It is heard that starting from September 1st, amidst the rising prices of everything, the inspection fee will also increase!

Looking at the many boilers within the concession, if the managers do not have experience and knowledge, there is a possibility of explosion at any moment, which would endanger the safety of residents within the concession. Therefore, the Municipal Council's decision to hold the "Factory Industrial Knowledge and Safety Training Class" does indeed have great significance and is worthy of our attention and approval. It is heard that the registration location is the Industrial Division, Room 602 of the Municipal Council (not the registration location published in the last issue). For the sake of industrial safety and their own work efficiency, factories should encourage mechanics to actively register and participate!

### Joint Organization of Customs Brokers / Through Transport of Goods to the Interior / Linking Jinhua, Lanxi, Yingtan, and Tunxi / Special Arrangements for Shipping from Shanghai and Ningbo with Offices Set Up Along the Way

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, all coastal ports in China have been controlled by the Japanese Navy. In southern China, only the routes to Guangzhou Bay and Beihai are accessible. However, transportation to the interior is very inconvenient. Therefore, transportation has been concentrated in Haiphong in French Indochina. Although transportation to the interior is convenient there, there is a lack of vehicles, resulting in the accumulation of goods and difficulty in clearing them in a timely manner. Shipping companies and customs brokers have sought alternative solutions and opened up the Saigon-Kunming through transport. Goods are transported from Shanghai to Saigon, loaded onto trains in Saigon, and transported to Kunming for delivery. This is very efficient because there are fewer goods transported to the interior from that location, making it easier to transport out. If all goods are concentrated there in the future, there may be similar difficulties as in Haiphong.

As for

Eastern Zhejiang Freight

Originally, Wenzhou and Ningbo were the hubs for connecting Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces. Starting last month, the Oujiang River was suddenly blocked by the Japanese Navy, and the Shanghai-Wenzhou line was interrupted. The Zhenhai port was blocked, and shipping in eastern Zhejiang was almost cut off. Later, after the shipping companies requested, they were approved by the authorities to anchor and load and unload passengers and goods outside the Zhenhai blockade line. Initially, the restrictions were very strict, and two-way freight was sluggish. Recently, thanks to the

Authorities' Relaxation

Freight has greatly improved, and the number of passengers has doubled. It is now heard that Ningbo Yuanchang Customs Brokerage, jointly with Shanghai Yu Ji Customs Brokerage at No. 56 Yangxing Street, Xinchangyuan Customs Brokerage at No. 8 Hengyuan Lane, Tianjin Road, Yushungong Customs Brokerage in Yongan Lane, Yongan Street, and Yufengting Customs Brokerage in Sassoon Lane, Daijun Bridge, etc., have organized

Shanghai-Ningbo Through Transport

Connecting freight transport to Jinhua, Lanxi, Yingtan, and Tunxi. Special arrangements are made for all ships departing from Shanghai to Ningbo. Offices are set up in various places for transporting goods from Ningbo to the interior, providing care along the way. Customs declaration procedures are simple and quick, and transportation is stable and fast. It has already officially opened, and it should greatly facilitate freight transport in eastern Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and southern Jiangxi in the future.

### Land Broker Fails to Return Land Certificate / Accused of Fraud and Breach of Trust

Zhu Ruiqing (also known as Zhu Guisheng), a local resident of No. 56 South Chengdu Road, who has been a land broker, was recently sued by Yu Fangben (30 years old this year), a local resident of No. 18 Yu Jialong, Wagner Road, French Concession, in the criminal court of the First Special District Court through lawyer Ma Junshuo, accusing him of crimes such as defrauding money and breach of trust, and including a civil lawsuit. The gist of the complaint is as follows: The plaintiff (Yu Fangben) owns an old-fashioned single certificate for a plot of land measuring 3 fen, 4 li, and 1 hao located at No. 18 Yu Jialong, Wagner Road, French Concession, which is plot number 9 and 19 in the Yunziwei, District 11 of the Special District. He entrusted Zhu Ruiqing, also known as Zhu Guisheng, the defendant, who was acting as a land broker, to exchange it for a land certificate from the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff was unfamiliar with the procedures and young and easily deceived. He initially demanded a tip of five hundred yuan. Then, he used delaying tactics for several years, and the plaintiff's demands were ineffective. Recently, he even took advantage of the case of Yao Zhijiang's mutual aid fund execution, No. 106 in the enforcement order of the Second Special District Court, to collude with Yao and falsely claimed that the plaintiff had mortgaged the land to the defendant for 2,040 yuan, which the defendant had already obtained on behalf of the plaintiff, and audaciously applied for the auction to participate in the distribution. Not only is there no deed to prove the alleged mortgage, but there is also no actual debt. The defendant's actions were actually taking advantage of the opportunity to handle affairs for others, violating his duties, and intending to obtain illegal benefits for himself. He is clearly guilty of violating Article 339, Paragraph 1, and Article 342 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, he is filing a private prosecution in accordance with the law, requesting that the defendant be punished for his crimes, and including a civil lawsuit requesting that the defendant be ordered to return the land certificate No. 2325 and the cadastral map. The court will summon the defendant for questioning in the coming days. At the same time, the plaintiff Yu Fangben also applied to the civil court of the Second Special District Court for preservation of evidence, that is, the land certificate No. 2335 and the cadastral map, to prevent Zhu Ruiqing from claiming them.

### Application for National Goods Certificate / To be Filled Out Once Every Six Months

The China National Goods Production and Sales Association requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs to stipulate the validity period of the national goods certificate by telegram. Now, the Ministry has approved and replied, "Received. Regarding the request to stipulate the issuance of national goods certificates, as the conditions of factories vary in different regions, it is not appropriate to include them in the regulations. We now set a temporary method as follows: (1) Manufacturers who have already obtained national goods certificates should fill out a statement of items once every six months and submit it to the Ministry for record. The form is the same as the statement of items that should be included when applying for a national goods certificate. (2) The completed statement of items should be submitted by the local competent authority for forwarding, or sent directly for review after being certified by a legitimate local industrial and commercial organization. The certification procedures are handled in accordance with the methods for filling out and submitting the statement of items for applying for a national goods certificate. Please follow this and inform the members of the association to comply." This is the approval.

### The Hongqiao Road Golf Club / All Chinese Staff Arrested / Japanese Army Searched but Found Nothing

The Hongqiao Township Golf Club in western Shanghai, organized by foreigners living in Shanghai, covers an area of approximately 300 mu. Many foreigners go there to play golf every Saturday afternoon and Sunday. The club employs about 40 Chinese staff members (servants, head clerks, coolies, etc.).

The delivery locations were inside the Xin'jing, Ri'xin, and An'shen warehouses, and it was loaded and transported by Anle Factory's own truck No. 20469, leading Anle to lose the case. However, the Anle Factory side stated that although the truck number was indeed owned by their factory, the endorsement for the

Shipping Period

Just as the coolies were carrying it, many poor men, women, old, and young people from nearby rushed up and robbed the flour, carrying it away on their shoulders. The truck driver and workers blew the whistle and shouted for arrest. Upon hearing the alarm, the Xujiahui French police station immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to rush to the scene and detained eleven people, including Chen Wensheng, Jiang Xiaofa, Li Zhonglin, Yang Yunshan, Sheng Zeying from Anhui Province, Wan Qizhi from Hebei Province, Yang Gensheng from Nanjing, Gong Shengshi, Wang Heshi, and Kuai Liushi from Anhui Province.

### The Dashing Thief / The Jiang Jianqiu Case / The Appeal is Scheduled for Trial

The dashing thief Jiang Jianqiu was sentenced to five years in prison by the First Special District Court in May of this year after being detained by the Public Concession Police for committing dozens of cases of enticing prostitutes, dancing girls, tour guides, female performers, mistresses of wealthy families, etc. and stealing, robbing, etc. in the two concessions. Later, he was brought by the French Concession Police to the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for public prosecution on charges of theft, fraud, and robbery. The swindled female performers Yu Guifen, Yao Yuchan, and the rich man's concubine Jinxiang, etc. did not appear in court. The judge in charge of the case, Qiu Huan'ying, ruled after the trial that Jiang was sentenced to nine years in prison for the robbery portion. As for the theft and fraud portions, although Jiang confessed without concealment, because the First Special District Court had already sentenced him for continuous crimes, it was ruled to dismiss the charges. Jiang, feeling unwilling to be sentenced to nine years in prison for the robbery portion, hired lawyer Zhang Qieping to file an appeal to the Third High Court, requesting a reduction. It is now learned that the Third High Court has approved the request and has scheduled to bring Jiang Jianqiu to trial on September 4th at 9:00 AM. The end of this sensational dashing thief case is not far off. It is still difficult to predict whether the swindled Yu Guifen, etc. will appear in court to confront him.

The original telegram is recorded below: "To all teachers of schools at all levels across the country, the Central Government has decided to designate Confucius' birthday as the Teachers' Commemorative Day of the Republic of China. This is because Confucius established a model of tireless spirit, setting an example of self-establishment and helping others to stand, removing treacherous officials and revitalizing human relations, distinguishing between barbarians and Chinese and upholding righteousness. Therefore, he can be a teacher for all generations and his influence can be felt across the four seas. Now, as you face a time when enemy troops are rampant and the country is in turmoil, whether you are raising your arms and braving the enemy's weapons, or carrying children on your backs to preserve learning, resisting aggression and building the nation are equally important. The patriotic enthusiasm shown by teachers in the war zones is particularly admirable, inspiring the people. We predict that our nation will surely prosper, and the trend of righteousness indicates that the island barbarians are exhausted. Let us work together to achieve this success and jointly wish for the eternal prosperity of our nation, laying this initial foundation. I respectfully send this telegram to express my condolences and wish you good health." [Signed] Chen Lifu, with seal.

At the same time, this Ministry, recognizing that the goals of moral education in the past have not been clearly defined, has also formulated and promulgated outlines for moral education at all levels of schools, so that those responsible have something to follow, and those who teach have a path to follow. It is hoped that rule by man and rule by law will complement each other, and that teaching by establishing oneself and helping others will be for the country. All comrades in schools across the country who serve as tutors must use the spirit of tireless teaching to seek the ultimate joy of educating talents, set this as their goal, and work together to achieve it."

### Promoting the Pasta Movement

— Mangmang

The continuous rise in rice prices has made some poor people feel the threat to their lives. The increasing trend of snatching rice shows that they have been forced to a dead end. If they are forced further, perhaps something even more violent than snatching rice will happen. Social tranquility will become even more unsustainable.

How can this panic be resolved? Generally speaking, only (1) should the Public Works Department use its power to eliminate the control of rice transported from the mainland to Shanghai; (2) effectively eliminate hoarding; (3) increase labor compensation. As for purchasing Saigon rice to regulate the market, it is really not a good idea at this time of plummeting foreign exchange reserves. Judging from the situation in the past one or two months, the above points are difficult to achieve in a short period of time.

However, the urgent and serious livelihood problem cannot be delayed any longer. Then, "promoting the pasta movement," under helpless circumstances, also has a bit of "emergency relief" value.

Perhaps some people will object to this proposal, and their reason must be: "Southerners are used to eating rice and are not used to eating pasta." This is certainly true, but what if there is no rice? At that time, will they not only be able to bear the pain of not eating rice? The ready-made example is not far from the eyes. After August 13th, white rice was once cut off, and people were not forced to eat pasta. It can be seen that "being unaccustomed to it is a small matter, starvation is a big matter"!

Of course, it is undeniable that pasta is difficult to make and difficult to eat; in fact, if it can be made habitually, today make noodles, baked cakes, tomorrow make pancakes, steamed buns, changing the taste every day, it can be eaten habitually.

How to make pasta? This is a technical problem, and so few people in Shanghai know this technique. To solve this difficulty, it must be done step by step. As far as I can think of, the following attempts can be made:

(1) Newspapers should introduce more common sense about making pasta, such as how much yeast powder to put on a certain amount of flour when making steamed buns, and how much salt to put when making pancakes.

(2) Lunches can be partially replaced with pasta, because most people already feel burdened by a lunch of 20 or 30 yuan; if pasta can be used instead to reduce the price, the eaters can reduce their burden, and their business scope can be expanded as a result. Small restaurants may also wish to try it.

(3) Families can make it themselves. If they do not know how to make it, they may wish to have some "consumer cooperation." Within a house, jointly hire a short-term worker who makes pasta (it is best to work only before lunch and dinner to avoid conflicting with the worker's original working hours, because the remuneration can be lighter), and the variety of dishes can be changed. Or several families can cooperate to hire a pasta worker. After learning it yourself, you can do it yourself.

(4) As a compromise, you can have rice for one meal and pasta for another.

If you can endure it for a while, habits will slowly develop. After pasta becomes popular, the consumption of rice will be reduced, and the price of rice will also decrease. In addition, because pasta is relatively simple, firewood, oil, sauce, vegetables, etc. can also save a lot.

However, the lesson of rice must be taken into account, that is to say, after pasta becomes popular, it is difficult to guarantee that the price of flour will not rise. This depends on the Public Works Department's efforts, because the existing flour reserves are sufficient for two or three months. If the Public Works Department can purchase and sell them at a fair price, it will be a great merit for the livelihood of the poor.

### Celebrities' Clothing

— Nianyun

Chairman Lin, who is highly respected, always wears a gown, whether he is in the office or resting; in the spring, he likes to wear a thin blue cotton gown, in the summer it is a white summer cloth long shirt, in the autumn he wears a thin silk cotton gown, and in the winter he wears a sheepskin robe, sometimes with a black wool coat.

Our leader, President Chiang, usually likes to wear Zhongshan suits and long shirts. He rarely wears simple military uniforms. In the hot summer season, he always wears a summer cloth long shirt; in short, his clothes are extremely civilian.

General Feng Yuxiang, Deputy Chairman of the Central Military Commission, is frugal by nature and does not like to wear long gowns and silk fabrics; he usually wears short clothes, especially in winter, a short cloth jacket and a cloth belt, looking very much like a villager; one year, when Feng entered Beijing, General Li Liejun gave him a set of sky-blue silk long gown and black satin short jacket. Feng wore the robe and jacket given by General Li to pay homage to Hu Hanmin and to the opening of the Central Plenary Session, as well as the three major ceremonies of visiting the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum.

### Idle Chat About Handkerchiefs

— Shen Xishen

The purpose of a handkerchief is to wipe away tears and saliva, and to mop up sweat. Therefore, whether men, women, the old, or children, everyone needs to have one ready. Especially when going out or attending banquets, if you forget to bring your handkerchief, you will feel very inconvenienced!

In the past, most people used white handkerchiefs. In recent years, however, handkerchiefs of various colors have become popular. Red, yellow, blue, and green, a riot of colors! Some are woven into squares or stripes, others are printed with various figures and flowers, and still others are embroidered with extremely exquisite designs. You can choose the pattern that you find most pleasing according to your own preferences. However, the material of handkerchiefs is always one of two types: silk or cotton. (I have never seen woolen handkerchiefs.) However, they come in different sizes. Men usually prefer larger sizes to show a generous and refined demeanor, while women prefer smaller sizes, finding them delicate and convenient.

Besides being used for wiping, handkerchiefs can also be used as decorations. For example, trendy young people often have a fine small handkerchief half-exposed in the left breast pocket of their Western-style suit. This handkerchief is certainly not for wiping.

Presenting a handkerchief as a gift to relatives, friends, or lovers to keep as a memento seems to express a deep and lasting meaning! And there is also the moment when your close relative or close friend is about to leave you for a long journey, and you are at the pier or station to see them off! The sorrow of parting, the helplessness of separation, a whistle blows, and the person departs! At this time, you can only raise and wave the handkerchief in your hand high to express your farewell. As the saying goes, "What dims the soul is only separation!" This is yet another function of the handkerchief!

### Walking

— Xinliang

In the past, when I was studying at middle school, because I had lunch at school, I had more than an hour of free time after the meal. To use this hour or so for studying would be too boring. To use it for playing ball and other sports seemed too unsafe for my body, with intense jumping and movement right after eating. Therefore, at that time, I would often gather two or three close friends, play the harmonica, or go to the Bund Park for a walk and relaxation (my alma mater was very close to the Bund Park).

Indeed, this hour or so of walking gave my body and mind a great deal of pleasure and comfort. Now, however, due to my job, this kind of walking is no longer possible.

Leisurely, carefree walking can not only refresh our tired minds, but also give our bodies some exercise (not strenuous). Our muscles can develop as a result, and our blood circulation can become smoother... Especially after a meal, we should not jump around vigorously, nor should we bury ourselves in our studies. If we casually invite three or four close friends and take a slow stroll together, the resulting benefits are truly beyond description in words.

Many people do not know the importance and pleasure of walking. As soon as they step out of the door, it seems that they cannot walk without a car. They make excuses such as the distance is too far, the weather is too hot, or their health is not good... and so on, as reasons for taking a car instead of walking. But in reality, we must know that walking is absolutely beneficial to both body and mind. Sometimes, even if the sun is blazing and it is exceptionally hot, or the distance is indeed too far, then taking a car for a short distance is certainly not out of the question. But for example, when you come out early in the morning, when the weather is not very hot and the air is very fresh, then even if the distance is a bit longer, as long as you leave a little earlier, you can very well walk to your place of work.

### Effective Remedy for Mosquito Bites

— Hua

In the hot autumn, we still like to bare our legs, but annoying mosquitoes come specifically to attack us. It would be fine if they only bit us a few times; but they itch so much. If we are not careful and scratch the skin, it will inevitably become ulcerated, leaving many scars on our legs. Wearing short socks only makes it look worse. Now I am introducing a very cheap medicine that can immediately relieve itching when applied to the wound, so that our fair legs will never have unsightly scars!

The so-called effective medicine is a very stinky substance called ammonia, a pale yellow aqueous solution, commonly known as ammonia water. Although it stinks, it has a more significant effect than cologne. We can inject a few drops of ammonia into the cologne we buy, which can not only avoid the pungent odor but also increase the effectiveness of the cologne. The reason why Lin Wenyan's cologne sold on the market is more effective than other brands is because it contains a small amount of ammonia. However, cologne containing ammonia always has some odor, which cannot be eliminated without letting it sit for two or three years. Therefore, domestic cologne manufacturers are unwilling to add ammonia because they are afraid of the interest they would lose from having to let the products sit for two or three years. Our purpose is to stop the itching, so a little odor is not a big deal. Fortunately, it will evaporate as soon as it is applied to the legs, and it will definitely not make fragrant legs stink!

### Miscellaneous Notes on Clothing, Food, and Housing

— (Fenfen)

Fried dough sticks and sesame cakes are the most common foods, but now their price has doubled. From now on, "three coppers for fried dough sticks and sesame cakes" has become a thing of the past.

Although it is already autumn, the weather is even more sultry and hot than before, with little rainfall, which is unpleasant. Burning mugwort and calamus in the room can slightly dispel the dampness.

Some people say that in the future, living in the "Isolated Island" will become "tea room-like," separated by wooden boards, with the pedestrian walkway in the middle serving as a "public dining hall."

There are also good options for commoners to beat the summer heat, such as iced mung bean soup and sour plum soup.

Fewer people are wearing sunglasses this year. I don't know why.

The swimwear business has declined sharply because it is too aristocratic. If you visit the swimming pool, you will see that most men are shirtless, wearing only black shorts.

### One Week's Economical Menu

— Ms. Huaying

Among meats, pork is the most versatile, just like licorice in medicinal herbs, it is indispensable everywhere. The methods of cutting meat are also diverse, whether it is cut into chunks, slices, shreds, or diced, or chopped finely into mince, or just using meat bones. The complexity of the cooking methods can be imagined. Among them, chopping finely into mince is a method with many variations and is relatively economical. After chopping the meat finely, mix it with soy sauce. The most common method is stuffing, such as stuffing meat into fried tofu or gluten. These two methods are suitable for soups; dry frying is not very suitable. In addition, there is also stuffing meat into old cucumbers. Peel the thick, large old cucumbers, cut them into sections, remove the seeds, and then stuff the meat mince inside. Then add fragrant mushrooms, daylily tips, and other ingredients, and braise them together in soy sauce. The flavor is quite good. Eggplants and tomatoes can also be prepared in the same way. When braising eggplants stuffed with meat, it is best to add some sweet sauce to make them more delicious. There are many tomatoes on the market lately, and they are not expensive. Smaller ones can be bought for seven or eight per dime. This item is extremely rich in vitamins. Using it to stuff meat and braise in soy sauce has a unique flavor. It can also be eaten after meals as a substitute for fruit. Just peel off the skin and dip it in some white sugar to reduce the sourness. Because it has a lot of water, it is no less appealing than honey peaches. Recently, because fruit prices are expensive, the writer often uses tomatoes as a substitute. Why don't everyone try it too?

### Photos of Rooftop Houses

— Chen Liang

What are "rooftop houses"? They are houses built using rooftops. There is a saying that goes, "Borrow heaven, not land." Using rooftops can be considered "borrowing heaven." This type of rooftop house existed before, but there are even more of them now. The population of the Isolated Island has surged, and the housing problem is difficult to solve. People have to rack their brains. This is certainly due to the landlords' heavy profit-seeking mentality, but it is also a way to remedy the housing shortage, so it does not seem too blameworthy.

The construction of ordinary "rooftop houses" can be divided into two types: one is carefully built, "magnificent and beautiful," and the other is simply built to provide shelter from the wind and rain. The former, although without steel and cement, is also brick-built and plastered, with columns and beams. Inside the room, you wouldn't know that you are in a "building outside a building." This type of "rooftop house" has a breadth and length similar to a small attic room, but with windows on three sides, there is ample light and air circulation. In the summer, there is a cool breeze, and in the winter, there is sunshine. It is warm in winter and cool in summer, and the attic room will sigh in comparison. Moreover, the "building outside a building" stands alone, isolated from the good wife in the front building, the aunt in the back building, and the sister-in-law in the attic room... saving a lot of trouble and avoiding minor conflicts that may arise from trivial matters, like transcending the world, it is incomparably peaceful.

As for rent, in this area of "every inch of land is gold," such a rooftop house is not necessarily cheap. About twenty dollars a month is considered a fair rent by the landlord. For people with small families who love peace and quiet, this type of rooftop house is very suitable. However, families with children cannot live there, otherwise, if they are not careful, they might roll a "topsy-turvy" on the narrow ladder, which is not a joke, and the safety of their little lives would be at risk. Living in a "rooftop house" also has an advantage: when you hear about a "fire" somewhere, other people have to run out to watch the excitement, but here, you only need to look out the window to have a clear view. However, if misfortune strikes and the trouble occurs in your own doorway, then the danger to the residents of this "rooftop house" is greater than in any other place. There are advantages and disadvantages, and nothing is absolute in the world.

Therefore, building houses using rooftops cannot be done casually. It must be approved by the police authorities. Otherwise, even if the new house is completed, it will be ordered to be demolished for public safety. However, some alley houses that are simply built "rooftop houses" are still everywhere. Old wooden boards serve as walls, rusted lead sheets as the roof, there is a cooking stove but no chimney, and a hole is punched in the wooden board as a window. Smoke comes out of the window, and the roof leaks on rainy days. Often there is heavy rain outside and light rain inside. The rent for such a "rooftop house" like a sampan is naturally much cheaper. Its residents are nothing more than rickshaw pullers, road workers, dock coolies... these laborers and small peddlers who carry their goods on their shoulders. These days, "housing" in Shanghai is indeed difficult. In a small building, you can feel the "variety."

### The Issue of Stopping Payment of Exchange Checks (i.e., Allocation Orders)

— Mu Shens

Our country used negotiable instruments earlier than other countries, but the names are often inconsistent, and the processing procedures are also divergent. This is because our country did not have a negotiable instruments law in the past to follow. However, it has always attached great importance to credit and has not diminished in its brilliance because of this, and there are many good achievements to be mentioned. Consider the "zhuang piao" of Shanghai in the past, which were issued by the remittance zhuang (i.e., money shops that were members of the Money Trade Association). Their credit was as good as cash, and Chinese and foreign merchants were happy to accept them. This was because the holder of a zhuang piao enjoyed the highest priority. If the issuing money shop went bankrupt, the Money Trade Association would immediately collect funds to fully redeem the zhuang piao that were circulating, regardless of whether they were due or not, never causing the holder to suffer any loss. It was once praised that zhuang piao were "golden butterflies," which shows how deeply they were welcomed.

Since the beginning of the Republic of China, banks have flourished, all issuing "banker's drafts" to circulate in the market, but they are not as popular as zhuang piao. In the past, foreign banks only accepted zhuang piao for shipments of imported goods, which is clear evidence of this. The reason for this is twofold: money shops are partnership organizations and bear unlimited liability, while banks are limited liability organizations. This is a difference in organization. The holder of a zhuang piao enjoys the highest priority, while bank drafts are generally regarded as ordinary claims. This is a difference in claims. Later, when a certain money shop was being liquidated, the Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that the holder of a zhuang piao enjoyed the highest priority, believed that this would easily lead to the abuse of zhuang partners issuing zhuang piao in advance for related deposits, which was unfair to all creditors. Therefore, it resolutely banned it, and the zhuang piao were included in the processing of ordinary debts. After that, bank drafts were used as commonly as zhuang piao and were no longer discriminated against.

In the current Shanghai market, zhuang piao and bank drafts are rarely seen. What circulates are mostly "exchange checks," which are the incarnation of the "allocation orders" of the past. Because they are checks issued by "exchange banks," they are called "exchange checks." According to the issuance of "exchange checks," money shops generally issue them through the "money vault," while banks issue them individually through the member banks, all of which are transferred to the "check clearing house." This is a good phenomenon of further cooperation between the silver and money industries—centralized exchange. The issuance method of "exchange checks" can be divided into two types: one is for depositors withdrawing deposits or holding a depositor's check requesting to exchange for a banker's draft, which can be regarded as a "banker's draft" or "zhuang piao"; the second is for holding a check or banker's draft requesting redemption, which should be regarded as a "transfer order." The issuance of "exchange checks" is nothing more than the above two ways. Therefore, the essence of "exchange checks" is either a "banker's draft" as a "credit instrument" or a "transfer order" as a "payment tool." There is no doubt about this.

Furthermore, the reason why "exchange checks" are called "checks" instead of "banker's drafts" or "transfer orders" is that "banker's drafts" and "transfer orders" are required to affix stamps according to regulations, and in this extraordinary period, they must be doubled. Today, calling them "checks" can obtain the preferential treatment of exemption from stamps. Therefore, the identity of an "exchange check" is actually no different from a "banker's draft" or a "transfer order," but it is called a "check" for the sake of saving stamps. Those who receive "exchange checks" only need to recognize that the check is not forged and pay attention to the reputation of the issuing bank (that is, the bank is unlikely to go bankrupt in the shortest period of time) to obtain sound protection and will never encounter a dishonored check. At present, "exchange checks" have been widely circulated, transferred and accepted, and have won the welcome and trust of society, no different from the zhuang piao of the past. There is good reason for this.

However, the fact is contrary to the theory. There have been many disputes arising from the rash stopping of payment of "exchange checks." If these unwarranted disputes are not resolved reasonably as soon as possible, the impact on the credit of bank negotiable instruments will be huge and will not be a blessing for the future of finance. It is worthwhile to study this. However, before the study, the author must first state his position: first, there is absolutely no malicious attack on any bank or shop; second, there is no one-sided defense on behalf of others. Only with the aim of throwing a brick to attract jade will I make a legal discussion, and I hope that the wise men of the financial community will further educate me.

The issuance method and essence of "exchange checks" have been seen above. Therefore, since "exchange checks" are issued by banks, whether they are "payment tools" or "credit instruments," the issuer bears the liability for negotiable instruments, and it is appropriate to regard them as "bank drafts." Once the identity of "exchange checks" is determined, its degree of credit is not difficult to estimate. According to past customs, bank drafts and money shop zhuang piao only need not be forged, and the issuing bank or shop does not need to go bankrupt, then the bank drafts and zhuang piao should have a full redemption guarantee. Except for the holder's application for loss and stop payment due to theft or fraud, it has not been heard that the issuing bank or shop rashly stopped payment and returned the check. Perhaps bank drafts and zhuang piao are "promissory" negotiable instruments, while the current "exchange checks" are "entrusted" negotiable instruments. However, the issuance and commitment to redeem are inherently the same. From a legal point of view, "exchange checks" should be regarded as checks in accordance with the law because they are printed with the word "check." However, checks are "payment securities," so they focus on capital relations and are limited to sight payments (see Article 124 of the Negotiable Instruments Law). Today, in order to meet social needs, banks issue "forward exchange checks" as "credit instruments" with the nature of credit securities and regard them as "bank drafts," which is also appropriate. Regardless of whether they are "checks" or "bank drafts," the issuing bank promises to issue them first and should be responsible for redeeming them later. Because once a negotiable instrument is issued, the issuer is in the position of the principal debtor and should bear the unconditional responsibility for payment. It goes without saying that the holder obtains it directly from the issuing bank. Even if it comes from transfer and acceptance, as long as it is legally obtained, it is a "bona fide holder," and its right to use negotiable instruments is protected by law. Returning to the discussion, even if we recognize "exchange checks" as ordinary checks, according to the principle that negotiable instruments are "abstract securities," Article 10 of the Negotiable Instruments Law stipulates: "The debtor of a negotiable instrument may not use the reasons for protest between himself and the issuer or the previous holder to confront the holder..." Furthermore, according to Article 6 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, "The debtor of a negotiable instrument shall bear the burden of proof when the holder is found to have fraudulent malice or gross negligence." As such, the issuing bank of "exchange checks" must not arbitrarily stop payment, whether in terms of reason or law. This is very clear.

Perhaps our country originally had two procedures, "acceptance" and "certification," which are necessary for "exchange checks." If they are not performed, the holder is to blame. However, the "acceptance" procedure is a right enjoyed by the holder and is by no means an obligation that it must fulfill. The holder only needs to be able to identify that it is a genuine check and does not need to accept it. As for whether there are any entanglements in the negotiable instrument, as long as the holder obtains it legally, it is a "bona fide holder" and is protected by law (see Article 10 of the Negotiable Instruments Law). The "certification" procedure is also not necessary. As long as you trust that the issuing bank will not issue "bad checks" and will not stop payment without reason, there is no need to request "certification," which is a waste of procedure. Therefore, the above two points are not enough to remove the responsibility for the arbitrary stopping of payment and returning of "exchange checks." Furthermore, at present, remittance discounts are prevalent, and the discount rate is extremely high, forming today's serious problem. It is believed that those who engage in remittance discounts are not formal banks or money shops, but are newly established silver shops or money exchange shops with weak credit and limited capital. Those who can engage in such a large discount transaction generally beg for the accommodation of negotiable instruments from a small number of banks or money shops. Otherwise, without negotiable instrument financing and mediation, it is difficult to complete the transaction because there is no way to gain the trust of others. On the bank and money shop side, the financing of negotiable instruments is generally done with "exchange checks," and it is considered that "overdrafting the face value" is not important. If the borrower is unfaithful, it can be stopped for payment as a last resort, because the loan is a "check." This naive idea is not worth the laughter of knowledgeable people. There was once an "exchange check" obtained through discounting, which was brought to the issuing bank to request acceptance. The bank refused acceptance on the pretext of an immediate check, leaving room for stopping payment and returning the check, which proves the erroneous prejudice. It is because they hold this erroneous view that they do not pay attention to the financing of negotiable instruments. If the borrower encounters theft or fraud and is unable to compensate, the bank also believes that as long as it stops payment and returns the check, it can pass the blame on to the final holder. Their views are so absurd! Therefore, I once said that a small number of banks in the country mistakenly believe that the arbitrary stopping of payment of "exchange checks" is reasonable, which is enough to cause today's high discount rates.

Furthermore, I believe that "exchange checks" are widely circulated today and are the center of current negotiable instruments. On the social side, they are uniformly accepted and regarded as bank drafts or money shop zhuang piao, but on the bank side, a small number of banks hold erroneous views and lose their credit. It is necessary to correct this. Otherwise, who would dare to accept bank negotiable instruments? In the future, the effectiveness of negotiable instruments and the reputation of banks will be unimaginable. If it can be quickly eliminated in the invisible before society pays attention to it, and the credit of bank negotiable instruments is established, then the wind of empty loan negotiable instruments can be stopped, and the serious problem of high discount rates can also be solved accordingly. Its benefits are not only maintaining the credit of "exchange checks."

In summary, the author believes that the bank has signed the "exchange check", which has been in the position of the debtor of the negotiable instrument, and the redemption of the negotiable instrument is its due obligation. Except for the ability to prove that the holder is not a bona fide acquirer, there is no way to change its redemption responsibility. Under the principle of tightening legal tender and promoting negotiable instruments, this industry has become the "exchange check" payment issue that is the center of circulating negotiable instruments. It is honestly one that does not tolerate a silent people. (28/8/18)

### The Future of American Gold Policy

— Zou Sicong

Since various countries around the world have successively managed their currencies, many economists believe that the future of gold will also follow the path of decline, similar to silver. However, the US government purchased gold worth $1,110 million in 1936, $1,586 million in 1937, and $1,974 million in 1938. According to a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, as of July 26 of this year, the US Treasury's gold reserves, calculated at $35 per ounce, had reached $16,227 million, accounting for over 64% of the world's total gold reserves, an increase of $3,225 million compared to the same period last year. In a letter from US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to Senator Wagner (the original letter reprinted in *The Banker*, June 1939), he mentioned the allocation of Treasury gold reserves. It is stated that the majority of the Treasury's gold reserves are used as backing for the Federal Reserve Banks' issuance of gold certificates, according to the Gold Reserve Act. If, due to the necessity of clearing international balance of payments or maintaining the purchasing power of various US currencies, the Secretary of the Treasury approves, gold certificates can be exempted from being backed by gold bullion.

Gold has two monetary uses: first, as a reserve for currency issuance, and second, for clearing international balance of payments deficits. The US Treasury possesses $16,227 million in gold, and with such narrow uses, it is bound to become bloated. US law stipulates that Federal Reserve notes must have 40% gold certificates as reserves, and Federal Reserve Banks' deposits must have 35% gold certificates or legal currency as reserves. The purpose of the legal reserve is to prevent excessive expansion of the amount of banknotes in circulation and bank credit; however, the current holdings of gold and gold certificates far exceed the legally required reserves. As for using it for clearing international balance of payments deficits, there does not seem to be a more satisfactory alternative to gold at present. Many countries, due to a lack of gold, have to rack their brains and severely manage foreign exchange, control import and export trade, or adopt clearing agreements and barter agreements to try to solve the difficulties of balancing international payments. However, in the case of the United States, which has had a smooth international balance of payments in recent years, there is no need to adopt these methods, even without gold reserves. Therefore, the accumulation of gold in the United States has other reasons.

The main reasons for the massive influx of gold into the United States in the past five years are: huge inflows of overseas capital, favorable balance of both tangible and intangible trade, and the US government providing an unlimited gold market at a fixed dollar price. The process of gold flowing to the United States is as follows: capital inflows and a favorable balance of lending strengthen the value of the dollar against foreign currencies. Subsequently, foreign or American banks and merchants, seeing the potential for profit, transport gold to the United States and sell it to the US Treasury at a price of $35 per ounce, then sell the dollars obtained in the foreign exchange market, and the value of the dollar against foreign currencies falls. Through this structure, gold from all over the world flows continuously to the US Treasury.

As for the reasons for the massive transfer of foreign capital to the United States, the main reason is that war clouds are gathering in Europe and Asia, and flames of war are spreading. All funds regard the United States as a safe haven. This is one reason. The reason why some speculators transfer capital to the United States is that they predict that the exchange rate of their own currency against the dollar will fall, hoping to profit from exchange rate fluctuations. This is another reason. The United States' foreign trade has increased rapidly in recent years, and foreign banks and merchants have had to increase their working capital deposited in US banks. This is the third reason. American investments abroad are being withdrawn to the home country due to unfavorable political and economic conditions abroad. This is the fourth reason.

Since large amounts of gold have flowed into the United States, the US government cannot allow it to float freely on the market and stir up the market. Therefore, although there is a lot of gold stored in the Treasury, it is still necessary to continue purchasing it. Many people who do not understand the US government's painstaking efforts criticize the US government's gold policy, believing that gold is already repeating the history of silver, and the US government is exchanging the people's hard-earned products for useless gold, which is a foolish act. Some say that hoarding gold is a gambling act; others say that gold has become a great disaster for the United States.

In fact, the reason why the US government cannot stop buying gold is very simple, because if it stops buying gold, the general US economy will be seriously affected, the foreign exchange market and the gold market will experience great turmoil, international trade figures will be greatly reduced, and the promotion of all US recovery plans will be hindered. The exchange rate balance of several major currencies, such as the British pound, US dollar, and French franc, which has been maintained through years of painstaking efforts, will immediately collapse. This is even more expected. Therefore, some people advocate that the US government should prohibit the continued import of gold. However, this will cause the world gold price to plummet, leading to the elimination of the function of clearing international balance of payments; and the economies of gold-producing areas and gold-producing countries will also suffer extremely profound blows, which will affect the United States itself. Others advocate devaluing the gold price from $35 per ounce to $25, but the result would also be enough to affect the international exchange rate of the dollar, and the US government naturally would not dare to make a decision. Therefore, the US gold policy has continued to the present under a contradictory mentality.

Now that the outbreak of war in Europe is imminent, more gold is flowing to the United States from various places. The British government officially notified the United States the day before yesterday that it would stop maintaining the exchange rate of the pound. This may give the United States a suitable opportunity to reconsider the international gold price and exchange rate balance. Otherwise, the US economic boom in recent years will lose its continuation due to the expensive dollar. Even for political reasons, the United States also needs to revise the world gold price and international exchange rate balance, just like during the European war, the United States maintained the British pound to assist the Allied countries. It can be asserted that Shanghai speculators, who are still buying gold and foreign exchange, will sooner or later become victims of American economic security and political morality.

### The Future of the Japanese Economy (Continued)

— Translated by Ms. Feng Meiqi

The United States' position in Japan's foreign trade is more important than that of the United Kingdom, especially in terms of military supplies. In 1938, Japan's imports from the United States were worth 915 million yen, or half of its imports from outside the yen bloc. Japan's exports to the United States were 425 million yen. Most of Japan's import deficit with non-yen bloc countries, about 490 million yen, was with the United States. Most of these were imports of military raw materials. In detail, in 1937, 54.4% of Japan's military raw material imports came from the United States, 17.5% from the United Kingdom, and 7.4% from the Dutch East Indies. More came from the United States in 1938. Since Japan began restricting imports of non-essential goods, imports from the United Kingdom have fallen by half, from 1,110 million yen in 1937 to 550 million yen in 1938; on the other hand, imports from the United States have fallen by only a quarter, from 1,269 million yen to 915 million yen. In other words, the ratio of exports from the United States to Japan to those from the United Kingdom was 12.7 to 11 in 1937, but 9.1 to 5.5 in 1938.

Table (7) shows the statistics of US exports to Japan from 1937 to 1938. This shows the importance of the US market for Japan's exports. With the exception of a few items such as rubber, this table includes all of the military raw materials that Japan needs to purchase from abroad. At least four items, namely premium gasoline, automobiles, machinery, and scrap metal, cannot but be purchased from the US market. The total amount of military raw materials purchased by Japan and its percentage of imports is quite large. Of the $528 million in US exports to Japan from 1937 to 1938, $326 million—or 61.2%—were military raw materials. In 1938, due to a slight drop in prices, the quantity of these goods may have been even greater. Therefore, the drop in its value was small, while the increase in its percentage was large. The percentage of military raw materials in 1937 was 58.8%, while in 1938 it increased to 66.3%. In that year, Japan's imports of non-essential goods from the United States decreased by about half, while imports of raw cotton decreased by 15%. Raw cotton is not listed as a military raw material import in this table, although raw cotton is important to the Japanese textile industry, and a portion is also used for the manufacture of munitions. From 1937 to 1938, sales of American kerosene and kerosene products to Japan were equal to raw cotton. Finished munitions are not listed in the table. In recent years, the number of American goods sold to "Manchukuo" has also been quite large, and the percentage of military raw materials among them is even higher. Of the $30 million in US exports to "Manchukuo" in 1937 and 1938, at least $25 million, or 75.7%, were military supplies. Therefore, the total amount of military raw materials sold by the United States to Japan and "Manchukuo" from 1937 to 1938 reached over $350 million, not including indirect sales through Chinese ports.

Table (7) Analysis of US Exports to Japan (Thousands of US Dollars)

These figures show the importance of the US market to Japan's war effort in the past two years. If a war breaks out, Japan's need for this market will be even greater, but if the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands become hostile to Japan, their trade will automatically be cut off. Trade between the United States and Japan will also be severely restricted, and Japan will no longer be able to purchase its military raw materials from the United States.

From the contraction of the Japanese domestic economy, the decline of export trade, and the gradual depletion of gold reserves, we can see that its economic crisis is approaching day by day, so we can confidently assert that its collapse is imminent. From recent experience, we know that a modern economic society can extend its life for a considerable period without collapsing immediately. However, as the situation expands, Japan will undoubtedly be unable to maintain it for a certain period of time. Moreover, the Sino-Japanese war for the past two years has exhausted its strength.

(The following is a discussion of the impact of Anglo-Soviet negotiations on the Japanese economy, which is not very relevant to the current international situation, so it is omitted – Editor)

### New Posture of Industrial Construction in the Southwest (Continued from Issue 279)

— Zhu Erjia

In the past, among the financial institutions in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces, Sichuan Province was relatively complete. The rest were backward. In Guizhou Province, in the years before 1935, modern new-style banking organizations ceased to exist after the Bank of China was forced to close by warlords and the Guizhou Bank collapsed due to excessive issuance of paper money. From 1935 to 1937, the entire province only had branches of the Central Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China in Guiyang, the provincial capital. Now, modern new-style banks have been established in relatively prosperous counties in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces.

Financial institutions organized by the government are new products of the War of Resistance. At present, in addition to the central government's agencies, each province generally has adjustment agencies for agriculture, commerce, industry, and mining. Therefore, official financial institutions are also one of the fund-raising industries for completing the work of resisting and building.

The current content of the financial industry in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces is as follows:

Category Sichuan Province Guizhou Province Yunnan Province Total

Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces are vast and rich in resources. The content of the various factories for recent industrial construction includes new enterprises with huge capital, such as several yarn factories and chemical industries, with the largest capital reaching 6 million yuan. However, the majority of industries still lack strong financial resources. In terms of the number of factories, it is still far from becoming an emerging industrial center.

Inland industries receive various rewards and preferential treatment from the government, but national industries located in the Shanghai concessions are not only subjected to various forms of exploitation, but also face the danger of being cut off from the supply of raw materials and the outlet of products at any time. The difference between the two is like heaven and earth. However, although the industrial circles in Shanghai have the idea of ​​seeking shelter under trees, the reason why they are hesitant to move forward is nothing more than the lack of security in the interior and the difficulty of transporting factories. And the high-priced market in Shanghai, which is caused by foreign exchange black market speculation, is the main element of nostalgia. Now, because the Ministry of Finance is trying to eliminate the rise of the foreign exchange black market and has taken measures to restrict withdrawals, there is already a threat of freezing industrial funds. At the same time, the Japanese blockade and control of transportation lines and the strengthening of raw material collection and exclusive estimation, and the dumping of surplus commodities have surrounded Shanghai industry on all sides. And today, inland transportation is no longer a problem due to the efforts of the authorities to improve it. If the government can slightly support the guarantee of inland security with the means of state-owned insurance, then the national industries in the Shanghai concessions will re-weigh the means of survival and consider it.

Commercial News

### Finance: Britain is Throwing Out Gold; Pure Gold Appears at an Unprecedented Peak of £7 15s.

London, 26th - The buying of British pure gold is more intense than the buying frenzy that occurred in December of last year when Germany rampantly persecuted Jews. The lack of maintenance has caused it to soar to an astonishing sum of four shillings and sixpence (fifty-four pence) per ounce, reaching an unprecedented peak of £7 15s. It is said that the increasingly tense European situation has caused people to fear, and they are throwing out British gold pounds and buying pure gold.

### Cash on the Black Market Soars: Raised to $4,180 Outside the Market

Yesterday's cash grey market situation, due to the value of the weekly holiday, did not have a formal market price, but the trend outside the market was quite good. It is believed that under the various attempts of US President Roosevelt to maintain peace in Europe, there is hope for a peaceful resolution. In addition, it was heard that British pure gold has soared by four shillings and sixpence, which has excited the depressed people due to the fear of the European war. The buying interest is extremely strong. For example, a certain money exchange company has the best stomach, and it is said that it is on behalf of the local gang. However, although the silverware gang and various cash shops have door-to-door purchases, they are unwilling to sell easily under good news, which has caused the price to rise sharply. From 4,120 yuan in the early morning, it skyrocketed to 4,180 yuan. There were a few transactions in the middle, and even at noon, it was difficult to obtain the above final price, which was more than 150 yuan higher than the closing price on the previous day. However, because it is not an official market price, the silver and jewelry gold per tael is exchanged for (because the wages can be increased) 410 yuan at Datong Hang and 408 yuan at Xin Tonghang, and the proceeds are reduced by a dozen yuan.

### Large Silver Bars are Close to Small Silver Pieces

London, 26th - The large silver bar market has not changed recently. The forward price has shrunk by 1.25. India has sold, speculators have bought, the supply is limited, and the market situation is stagnant. Bombay Telegraph: Indian silver spot has shrunk by 3 annas, September has shrunk by 2 annas, and October has shrunk by 1 anna. There is no transaction, and the market situation is calm. As for the price of American silver spot and the exchange rate of the United States to foreign exchange, there is no telegram due to the hot weather on Saturday.

### The Problem of Fractional Currency is Becoming Serious Again

Since the disappearance of copper coin auxiliary coins in this city, this newspaper has advocated that the central bank, which is responsible for regulating finance, should issue fractional currency notes as soon as possible to provide relief. Months have passed in a blink of an eye, and the fractional currency notes were originally scheduled to be issued on the 22nd of this month, but due to procedures and other issues, they have been postponed indefinitely. When copper coin auxiliary coins are lacking, merchants have printed substitute coupons, but they are only applicable to one company and cannot be widely circulated. Instead, they are replaced by stamps, which are widely circulated. Recently, since the post office declared that it would refuse to redeem them at the original price, they have been sold at a discount. Therefore, various industries refuse to use them, and streetcar coupons are used for other purposes. In recent days, there has been a shortage of streetcar coupons, and those who take the bus are often told to get off because they do not have coupons and the ticket sellers cannot find coupons. Disputes often arise. Since the refusal to use stamps, the number of substitute coupons on the market has doubled, with various colors. It is estimated that there are hundreds of kinds. In the past, substitute coupons were mostly issued by large companies and streetcar companies. Now, restaurants, amusement venues, taverns, bathrooms, and even small cigarette paper shops are printing substitute coupons. The paper is rough, the printing is poor, and it becomes muddy after one use. If no measures are taken to ban it and allow it to rot, it will have a huge impact on the livelihood of the common people in the future. For the sake of unifying the currency system and reducing disputes, it is hoped that the central bank will issue fractional currency notes as soon as possible to facilitate circulation and facilitate the turnover of various industries.

### Coal: Haiphong Coal is Loaded in Shanghai; There is No Fear of Fuel Shortage in this City

The firewood and charcoal market was closed in Oujiang a month ago, and the source was cut off. The city's inventory is decreasing day by day, which has led to hoarding by speculators and monopoly by unscrupulous merchants. The black market has skyrocketed, which is unimaginable. Wenzhou Grade A charcoal has risen from 2.85 yuan per load to 8 yuan, and there is still no large supply. Huxijiang charcoal has shouted 4.8 yuan, and the market price has more than doubled. It is heard that a certain company brought 60 tons of Haiphong bagged charcoal from the French Concession yesterday and shipped it to Shanghai for trial sales. It has been loaded on a certain ship together with Hongji coal. If the sales are suitable, goods will come from the source, which will open a new source for charcoal, and there will be no fear of fuel shortage in this city.

### Hardware: Pig Iron and Copper are Sold Out

The spot goods of pig iron and copper currently circulating on the market are very scarce. Due to certain relationships, they are almost sold out. It is heard that those who have a slight inventory are also unwilling to throw them out. According to reliable sources, it is because a certain party is absorbing them in large quantities. Apart from this, another way to sell is not worth mentioning, so the standard is also very chaotic. However, it is dozens of yuan better than before. At the moment, the spot price of India's top pig iron is 340 yuan per ton, No. 2 is 330 yuan, Russia's top is 330 yuan, Yangzi's top is 320 yuan, and No. 2 is 310 yuan. In terms of copper, T·C purple copper ingots are sold for 200 yuan per load, brass strips are sold for 180 yuan, brass skin is sold for 180 yuan, purple copper skin is 210 yuan, and purple copper wire is 210 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to be tight and continued to rise. The guild's price for 24 coarse white spot goods was 44 yuan per stack, up 1.7 yuan, and 43.5 yuan per foreign stack, up 1.5 yuan. Transit goods were still 34 yuan. Taikoo car white rose 1.45 yuan, B mark was 47.5 yuan, CW mark 47 yuan, CX mark 46.8 yuan, DY mark 46.5 yuan, HX mark 46.3 yuan, H mark car red rose half a yuan, 30.5 yuan, Dutch red rose 1 yuan, spot goods have reached 40 yuan, transit 33.5 yuan, the local cotton white rose 2 yuan, Zhenji No. 1 44 yuan, No. 2 43.5 yuan, No. 3 43 yuan, No. 4 42.5 yuan. The national sugar is still rising tightly, and it is heard that the price of the trade has increased, and the market will definitely follow the high.

### The Current Difficulties of the Shanghai Raw Silk Industry (Continued)

— Qu Yang

Regarding the export of finished products, in the near future, it may also be possible to hand over a certain machine to the point of absolute management. This is also the best measure to monopolize the export of Shanghai raw silk and exclude the interests of third countries. The signboard of "Commodity Export Inspection" is used to inspect the quality of raw silk and issue "Export Certificates" to perform the task of the Commodity Bureau of the Ministry of Industry before the war, to "control" the export of Shanghai raw silk, and at the same time, it can seize all foreign exchange from the export of raw silk, making the production, manufacturing, and sales of the entire raw silk industry completely become its appendage.

This is the current crisis of the Shanghai silk industry. However, are we just waiting to die?

(3) Struggle leads to survival, compromise leads to death, and the third way is the end of destruction, only destroying our bright future.

How can the silk industry survive?

In Shanghai, the number of people engaged in the silk industry, from factory owners to employees, from brokers to export firms, is no less than 12,000! From the previous few times that people have oppressed the silk industry, from the situation of compromising on one side and inching forward, it seems that strong organized self-defense is possible to stop the other party's steps of attack. However, this requires silk factories, silk stacks, and export firms, regardless of Chinese or foreign merchants, to carry out a collective action, ignoring everything and ignoring everything. The movement is expanded and sustained, so that his attempt to control it becomes ineffective in a stagnant situation, and further promotes the attention of the world. This is still the negative side.

The positive side is to move silk factories inland, and for large-scale factories, to break them up into smaller units, so as not to be caught in one net. Everyone knows that the effectiveness of small silk factories in the suburbs of Wuxi is the best economic guerrilla force against control. In the Shanghai silk industry, due to the unresolved problem of cocoon transportation, and turning to opening small factories in the interior, and the grasp of this kind of operation is profitable, it is enough to prove that under the current conditions, large silk factories must adapt to the environment and change their form to continue to survive and accumulate future development power. The method of breaking them up into smaller units and returning to the guerrilla area is no longer empty talk, but a fact.

Not to Take Export as the Ultimate Goal

It is said that the cotton in North China, in addition to using it as much as possible, is burned to ashes for the sake of anti-control. This is the best way to combat "fighting a war with war." When our silk industry is to be controlled, breaking up silk factories into smaller units, reducing the production of raw silk, and never allowing a silk thread to be used is also the best coping strategy. Apart from this, there is no third way for us to choose. If there is, it is to cover up our own surrender, run to the end of destruction, and destroy our bright and brilliant future! — August 6th, sent from Wuxi — (End)

Transportation and Transport Edited by China Travel Service

### Taikoo and Jardine Increase the Price of Nanhua Passenger Tickets

Since Taikoo and Jardine revised their passenger ticket prices on June 22 this year, the prices of large dining room tickets are denominated in Hong Kong dollars, and the prices of various classes of official room and steerage tickets are denominated in national currency. Recently, because the companies have seen that foreign exchange has shrunk sharply and expenses have increased, they have decided to increase the prices of official room and steerage passenger tickets from Shanghai to various ports in South China by more than 10% from September 1, and still denominate them in national currency. The prices of large dining room tickets will still be the same as the prices revised by the two companies on June 22, and this decision has not been increased. The newly revised ticket prices of the two companies from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Haiphong are listed as follows:

Shanghai to Hong Kong: Official cabin, National Currency 65 yuan, Room cabin 50 yuan, Hanging bunk 40 yuan, Steerage 26 yuan.

Shanghai to Haiphong: Official cabin, National Currency 120 yuan, Room cabin 88 yuan, Hanging bunk 58 yuan, Steerage 47 yuan.

Haiphong landing tax: still 4 yuan for official cabin, 2 yuan for room cabin, and 1 yuan for hanging bunk and steerage.

According to the price increase method of the companies on August 22, those who have prepaid a fixed amount or have purchased tickets before the price increase date can still enjoy the old price. In order to unify the ticket prices, the two companies have decided that for ships sailing south from Shanghai on or after September 1, the ticket prices must be purchased according to the newly revised prices, regardless of whether a fixed amount has been paid or a ticket has been purchased. Regarding the price of the northern route tickets of the two companies, they will still be sold according to the prices set on June 22, and there will be no price increase this time.

### Guide for Students Abroad in America

— Inquiry

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

Clothing: Preparations for clothing have already been discussed in this publication's "Procedures for Studying in America," so there is no need to repeat them. Now, I will just briefly discuss clothing in general. Young women usually wear Chinese clothes, so there is nothing special to pay attention to. Male students in America generally dress casually, but sometimes one cannot be too careless. In general, people in large cities dress more neatly than those in small cities, and people in the East dress more elegantly than those in the West. There are also significant differences between graduate students and undergraduate students, and liberal arts students dress better than science and engineering students. Of course, this is only a general observation, and there are always exceptions. In terms of occasions, banquets and dances are the most formal, but formal wear is rarely needed. When meeting guests (especially women) and attending tea parties, one should also dress neatly. Larger dining halls and decent restaurants also require neat attire, unless it is extremely hot summer. Students attending classes in large cities mostly dress neatly, while in small cities, vests and short jackets are sometimes worn, and ties are not always worn. In Western universities, not wearing a tie is almost a custom, and in the summer, most wear only shirts and trousers, occasionally with a tie. In small restaurants near the school, most people are very casual. Americans usually wear matching colors for their tops and bottoms. Although it is also acceptable to wear different colors for the top and trousers, few people dress like this in formal settings.

Chinese students going to America for advanced studies should naturally follow local customs in terms of clothing, but do not imitate the so-called "bohemian" style (long hair, large bow ties), which will make people laugh. It is best to pay attention to others and follow the majority. In ordinary times, it is better to dress a little more neatly than to be too casual. Cleanliness is also essential. Americans are tolerant of their own people in everything, but they are sometimes picky about foreigners, saying that others do not know etiquette. Chinese-owned laundries are almost everywhere in America. Although the prices are not necessarily cheaper, the work is always more authentic than that of general American laundry workers. Moreover, the money they earn through hard work is either sent back to the motherland or donated to disaster relief or to support the war effort. It can be said that it is an obligation for all those living in America to patronize their businesses. They are usually very friendly to Chinese students. Students who speak Cantonese may be invited to their shops for festivals, especially during Chinese New Year, to enjoy a lavish feast. Female students mostly do their own laundry, and most of the rental houses in women's dormitories have laundry facilities. When in America, do not casually leave your clothes and hats, especially expensive items such as leather coats. Especially in large cities, some people are not shy about taking good things.

### Shanghai Shipping Trends (Continued)

— Scenery

Domestic Shipping Routes: There were originally shipping lines to the Yangtze River, South China, and North China. The Yangtze River line departed from the Huangpu River in Shanghai through the Wusongkou and went upstream along the Yangtze River, passing through Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and reaching Hankou. From Hankou, it could go upstream to Changsha, Yichang, Chongqing, and other ports. The South China line departed from the Huangpu River in Shanghai through the Wusongkou and went south into the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Most of the ships terminated in Guangzhou, and very few sailed to Haiphong. The North China line departed from the Huangpu River in Shanghai through the Wusongkou and went north into the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea, reaching Tianjin. Along the way, it stopped at Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and other ports. Some ships also terminated at Andong, Dalian, Niuzhuang, and Qinhuangdao. After the war, the conditions of the shipping lines often changed due to the unstable situation. Except for Japanese ships that could still travel the Shanghai-Hankou line, foreign merchant ships could only navigate to ports such as Zhanghuanggong and Xingang at the mouth of the Yangtze River. The South China line is currently thriving in terms of passengers and cargo because Haiphong and Annam have become important channels into the interior of our country. Therefore, most companies' ships have changed their destination to Haiphong. Other seaports such as Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou have fallen one after another. Therefore, the main ports of the South China shipping route are only Hong Kong and Haiphong. The ships of the North China shipping route continue to operate, as passenger and cargo traffic between Shanghai and Tianjin is still quite busy. The names of the shipping companies operating along the coast of our country and Annam, and the shipping routes they operate, are listed below:

1.  Jardine Matheson & Co. (Indo-China S.N. Go.): A British company, operating small Yangtze River routes with ships such as Ruihe and Tonghe, with several trips per week, all arriving on the same day. For the Haiphong-Tianjin route, there are new ships Taisheng, Yongsheng, and Desheng, each with a load capacity of approximately 4,000 tons. The four new ships of the former state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Yuanheng Lizhen, were renamed Yisheng, Hesheng, Yusheng, and Mingsheng after being resold to the company. Each ship has a tonnage of approximately 3,400 tons. The cabins are divided into first class, second class, large dining room, officer's cabin, staterooms (only available on Yongsheng, Taisheng, Desheng, etc.), dormitory berths, and economy class. Since the addition of these four new ships to the route, the company's lineup has become increasingly strong. The above ships are scheduled to depart from Shanghai on four days of the week, passing through Hong Kong and arriving at Haiphong, then returning to Shanghai from Haiphong, and then sailing north through Weihaiwei and Yantai to Tianjin. This round trip takes more than thirty days. In addition to the above ships, there are ships such as Fusheng, Lisheng, Guisheng, Fusheng, and Chunsheng operating on the Shanghai-Qingdao and Shanghai-Hong Kong routes.

2.  China Navigation Company (Butterfield & Swire): Also a British company, operating the Shanghai-Tianjin line with regular ships Shuntian, Shengjing, and Hunan. The Shuntian and Shengjing are the most well-known, with a tonnage of over 3,000 tons. The cabins are divided into first class, second class, large dining room (Shuntian does not have a second class dining room), staterooms (Hunan does not have staterooms), dormitory berths, and economy class. They depart from Shanghai for Tianjin every Tuesday and Saturday, passing through Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and other ports. It only takes three days from Shanghai to Tianjin, and they return from Tianjin every Thursday. For the Shanghai-Haiphong route, there are Jinan, Taiyuan, Jiaying, Qiongzhou, and Guangdong, among which Jinan and Taiyuan are the most well-known, with a tonnage of approximately 3,000 tons. The cabins are divided into large dining room, officer's cabin, dormitory berths (staterooms are only available on Jiaying), and economy class. The scheduled trips are once a week, and it takes ten days to sail from Shanghai to Haiphong, stopping at Hong Kong (staying for approximately two days) and Guangzhou Bay along the way. In addition, ships such as Shandong, Sichuan, and Jiangsu often operate between Shanghai and Hong Kong, sometimes also calling at Haiphong. These ships have staterooms but no dormitory berths. Other ships such as Yunnan, Hubei, Yuezhou, Haikou, and Nanchang are dedicated to the Tianjin-Hong Kong route, stopping at Shanghai only occasionally. Recently, the company plans to open two lines: Shanghai-Siam and Shanghai-Singapore, using the Suzhou and Zhangjiakou to operate the Shanghai-Siam line, stopping at Hong Kong, Toulon, and Saigon along the way, and using the Qingyuan and Guiyang to operate the Shanghai-Singapore line to meet the needs of passengers and cargo.

### Canton-Hankou Railway Timetable

— Yun

The Canton-Hankou Railway is currently operating between Zhuzhou and Lechang as the starting and ending stations. All ticket prices and other items for each station were published in detail in the 16th issue of this publication, which readers should already understand. It is now known that the railway has resumed service to Qujiang. At the same time, the 75th and 76th section trains between Zhuzhou and Hengyang, the 77th and 78th section trains between Hengyang and Lechang, and the 79th and 80th section mixed trains between Lechang and Qujiang have all been canceled. Therefore, the entire timetable has been changed. Here is the latest current timetable for the railway:

The following is the passenger train timetable. Except for trains 5 and 6, which have first, second, and third class sleeping cars and seating cars, the rest only have second and third class sleeping cars and passenger cars.

### Travel Q&A

Answer to Ms. Zhang Ming: 1. It is quite convenient to transfer to Jinhua via Ningbo. For Shanghai-Ningbo ship tickets, you can first request a guarantee from Lihe or Zhongyi Shipping Company. After a reputable shop provides a guarantee, along with three photos, you can purchase tickets from the respective company. The lowest ticket price is 3.50 national currency. From Ningbo to Jinhua, you can first take a small boat to Hengzhang, then take the highway to Jinhua. The travel cost is 11.70 yuan. It is best to bring as little luggage as possible. There is no particular inconvenience for a single woman, but it is best to have an identity certificate when traveling in the interior.

Answer to Mr. Sun Zhongliang: 1. To go to Lishui, Zhejiang, you can take a small boat to Hengzhang after arriving in Ningbo, then take the highway via Xinchang, Shengxian, Dongyang, Yongkang, and reach Lishui. The travel cost is approximately 15 yuan.

Answer to Mr. Gao Zhongwen: 1. To take a boat to Tianjin, you only need to have a smallpox vaccination certificate issued by the Municipal Council here to purchase tickets and depart. The lowest ticket price is 26 national currency. Most ships dock at Tanggu, and passengers must take a car to Tianjin from Tanggu. The inspection is very strict when landing at Tanggu, so it is best to bring as few books as possible.

Answer to Mr. Li Funan: 1. Currently, only Butterfield & Swire ships operate from Beihai to Shanghai, but there are very few trips. The journey takes at least eight days, with staterooms costing approximately 70 national currency and economy class costing 38 yuan.

Answer to Mr. Jin Muye: 1. On the way from Shanghai to Chongqing, the China Travel Service has branches in Haiphong, Hanoi, Kunming, and Guiyang. There are hostels in Pingyi, Annam, Tongzi, and Qijiang. The total travel cost, including food and lodging, should be at least 210 yuan per person. 2. To take a China National Aviation Corporation plane from Hong Kong to Chongqing costs 400 Hong Kong dollars per person. If you take a plane from Hong Kong to Yunnan, there is no direct route. You should first take a French airline plane to Hanoi, which costs 14 pounds sterling per person. Then, take a China National Aviation Corporation or Eurasia plane from Hanoi to Yunnan, which costs 14 pounds sterling per person. Then, take a China National Aviation Corporation or Eurasia plane from Hanoi to Yunnan, which costs 140 Vietnamese currency per person. Each person is only allowed to bring 15 kilograms of luggage when flying. 3. Although taking the Zhejiang-Jiangxi route to the interior is still convenient, for safety reasons, taking the route through Vietnam is better. The travel cost from Guilin to Chongqing is 66.90 national currency, and to Kunming is 75.60 yuan. When traveling in the interior, you must have identification documents.

Answer to Mr. Guan Yilian: 1. To go to Taiping County, Anhui, it is also convenient to take the route through Ningbo. After arriving in Jinhua, take the train to Lanxi, then take the highway via Shexian to reach Taiping. The travel cost from Ningbo should be more than 30 yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### The European Situation is Tense, Scenes on the Streets of Shanghai

— (New Dream)

Newspaper Vendors are Very Active, Speculators are Uneasy

The atmosphere in Europe is extremely tense, resembling the eve of a great war, and Shanghai, far away in the eastern corner, has also broken its dull state and suddenly become tense due to the European situation. Everyone is waiting for news from Europe: peace or war?

The sound of "Extra Edition," which has not been heard for a long time, is spreading all over the streets and alleys. The newspaper vendors on Wangping Street are very active and showing off. Daily newspapers, evening newspapers, and extra editions are grabbed and run around, shouting at the top of their voices.

Early in the morning, the streets are full of people waiting for the newspapers to come out. Smart merchants and doctors use wall newspapers to promote their advertisements. The newspapers are posted up and surrounded by people who cannot afford to buy a copy to read. They are all closely watching the international news and the situation in Europe.

In the Changgeng Lane area of ​​Avenue Edward VII, every afternoon, many people wait for several foreign newspapers to post news summaries to see if Europe will go to war? What is Hitler doing? What is Chamberlain doing?

General speculators are uneasy about the European situation. Those with gold and foreign exchange are wondering whether to spit them out at this opportunity. Those who do not believe that the price of gold will fall immediately are hesitating whether to buy in. The speculative market, which changes rapidly and has several price movements a day, requires a keen eye. Fortunes are made at this time, and bankruptcies also occur at this time!

Once the "talking box" is opened, business people cannot escape their profession in three sentences: some argue that once the European war starts, foreign exchange will rise and foreign goods will fall in price; others say that if there is war in Europe, some foreign goods will disappear from the market and rise sharply, as there were many examples in the previous European war. Everyone has their reasons, and it is impossible to say who is right and who is wrong.

Those with a higher level of knowledge talk about international issues. The signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact was unexpected. How will it benefit China? How disappointed will Japan be? What will happen to the East if a war breaks out in Europe? Will there be changes in Shanghai and Hong Kong? Is a European war beneficial or harmful to China?

The people in the entire city are so concerned about the events in Europe that even women who never read newspapers are talking about their half-understood international news. Germany and Russia are making friends, which is miserable for "××××." If Europe goes to war, can Shanghai be stable? Don't the foreigners in the concessions start fighting as well, which would be terrible. If the news is bad, we can only go back to the interior.

In short, these few days, whether you stay at home or go outside, you can hear people talking about the events in Europe everywhere. Although it is across the ocean, it seems to be close at hand. This proves that in the modern world, a war in one corner will affect every corner, and the relationships between countries are closely related.

### Salary Increases in Shanghai Foreign Firms

— Foreign Employee

In the past six months, the lives of Shanghai citizens have been very difficult due to rising prices. Of course, employees of foreign firms are no exception. An average salary of thirty to fifty yuan a month is difficult to exchange for food alone. Therefore, no matter how frugal you are, changing from long clothes to short clothes, from rice to porridge, or always eating rice flour, it is still impossible to make a living in today's soaring prices. Therefore, it is the urgent request of every foreign firm employee to hope that the company will generally increase salaries (allowances). The salary increase situation of various foreign firms has become news that everyone needs to know.

I have been working in foreign firms for more than twenty years, and I have worked in more than a dozen foreign firms. Because I know many employees of foreign firms, I am more familiar with the salary increase situation of various foreign firms. In order to meet everyone's need to know about the salary increase situation of various foreign firms, it is not meaningless for me to write down what I know and tell everyone.

The following are the salary increase situations of several famous foreign firms:

British American Tobacco Company: 20% to 30%, Wong Lo Kat: 30%, Imperial Chemical Industries: 20% to 40%, Wheelock and Marden: 20%, Ewo Firecracker Company: 20%, Sassoon: 20% to 30%, Siemens: 20%, Jardine Engineering Corporation: 20%, Shanghai Telephone Company: 40%, General Electric Company: 30%, Standard Oil: +%, Texaco: 15%, Shanghai Power Company: 20%.

Among these foreign firms, some increased salaries automatically, and some did so after requests. However, whether it was automatic or passive, the fact that the authorities of these companies were able to understand the suffering of the employees is worthy of our admiration.

However, there are still many foreign firms that have a disregard for the lives of their employees, such as the famous ×× foreign firm. It is said that when the manager of the firm was at a meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council discussing the salary increase issue for the employees of the Municipal Council, he was the only one who voted against it. When the firm's employees initially requested a salary increase from the authorities, the authorities replied: "×× is a British firm, and it follows the Shanghai Municipal Council's regulations, so it only increased one or two yuan." Later, when the Shanghai Municipal Council increased by 20%, the employees asked for the same increase, and the authorities said: "The Shanghai Municipal Council is the Shanghai Municipal Council, and ×× is ××," refusing to follow the Shanghai Municipal Council's regulations.

I remember that in the Shanghai Municipal Council's annual report from some year, when talking about the salaries of the police officers, the report stated that the Russian police officers' salary was 90 yuan per month, and the Chinese police officers' salary was 40 yuan per month. The annual report explained that the reason why the Chinese police officers' salary was lower was because the cost of food for the Chinese, who ate rice, was lower than that of the Russians, who ate meat. Now that the price of rice has reached 40 yuan, the Chinese who eat rice are getting the same salary as before, and they cannot even afford to eat rice. The employees of Shanghai foreign firms feel this very acutely.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

Chapter 15: Overseas Scandal Suddenly Welcomes Peach Leaf, Extraordinary Scene in the Fire Reveals Lotus Flower

That day, there was a concert in the Jiaang area. Alice's mother, who was also a musician, had made arrangements in advance and went to the concert that night. Alice was originally going to go as well, but suddenly she had a headache that afternoon. Headaches were originally minor matters, but there were many acquaintances at the concert, especially Ms. O'Hishi, who was most beautiful. Headaches often made people feel unwell, so Mrs. Alice said: "It's okay not to go. Just rest at home!" This concert was a grand affair, and many people from Lyon University went as well. Cheng Gong did not specialize in music, but he also went because he thought Alice and her mother would definitely be there. However, he only saw Mrs. Alice and not Alice, which was very disappointing to him. The concert ended after midnight at half past one. He did not expect that news would come in that the Albert Apartments had caught fire. It was Albert's apartment. In fact, it was a little earlier when the two children in the second floor of the apartment had already caused the disaster. It was not until 11:15 that someone noticed, and the fire brigade arrived there twenty minutes later. Everyone on the street knew that the Albert Building was on fire. However, the concert was still playing a famous piece by a piano master and a violin expert who had been invited from Paris. Everyone was listening attentively, and the concert hall was well-built, so no outside noise could enter. When the piece ended, the person in charge of the concert reported: "The Albert Building is on fire. Ladies and gentlemen, are there any of you who live near there?" As soon as these words were said, Mrs. Alice was the first to rush out. Cheng Gong followed closely behind. The others who were related to the Albert Building, students from Lyon University, and those who were acquainted with Alice also ran out one after another. When they arrived on the street, it was already a hubbub of voices, and they could see a red glow in the sky. At this time, Europe's firefighting methods were not as advanced as they would later become. Mrs. Alice arrived at the apartment next to the Albert Road, where she lived, but she did not see her beloved daughter Alice. She thought: "Alice must be at home tonight and did not go out. She lives on the fifth floor, and the fire started on the third floor. The fire rises, and if the stairs are burned, how can the people on the fifth floor get down? Moreover, she said she had a headache, so maybe she is already fast asleep." Mrs. Alice jumped up and down and screamed, "Alice! My Alice! Who will save her!" She saw a person jump out of the crowd and say, "Mrs. Alice, I will go look for Alice!" He jumped into the fire from the fire truck's ladder. (174)

### No Way Out

— Bai Hua

"Flirting With Fates"

A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Production, Showing at the Nanjing Grand Theater

The big-mouthed Joe E. Brown also has a long history with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but his works are all so-called "unspeakably wonderful" slapstick films. Compared to other Hollywood comedians, he is not as humorous as Laurel and Hardy (Laurel and Hardy also have some terribly chaotic works), but he is not as annoying as the Marx Brothers and the Ritz Brothers. Every one of his works is very lively, and the writers do not care whether the story is reasonable or unreasonable in order to create excitement.

Recently, after the release of Laurel and Hardy's "Block-Heads" and the Ritz Brothers' "The Three Musketeers," the general opinion is that the method of abandoning the play to accommodate the actors is quite successful. Joe E. Brown's "No Way Out" is at least influenced by this.

The story is as follows: Joe E. Brown is the owner of a traveling theater troupe. He leads the troupe members to perform in South America. He is in conflict with the local theater owner and becomes impoverished in a foreign land. Because he has life insurance, he attempts to commit suicide to use the compensation to help the troupe members. Thus, he makes all kinds of jokes in various suicide methods and finally obtains a one-year performance contract with the theater owner's permission.

This story is naturally absurd, and the slapstick is also excessively exaggerated, but the director is at least influenced by the above-mentioned factors by being able to take advantage of the rich local color and the atmosphere of the music.

And Joe E. Brown's two episodes of pretending to commit suicide and acting as a cow are also lovely. His attitude when drinking and the cow's actions are much more brilliant than those of general directors who specialize in learning a little bit of superficial knowledge.

If the script could strengthen the various embarrassing situations of the troupe members when they were down on their luck, and give Steffi Duna and Livo Carlilo more opportunities to act due to the party members' dissatisfaction with Sanco's greed for women, it might have achieved even better results.

The zinc plate above is a recent work by Mr. Tang Menggu.
