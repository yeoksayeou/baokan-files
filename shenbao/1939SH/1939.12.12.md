Editorial

### Correcting the Rice Market

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the Municipal Council of the French Concession jointly issued a notice yesterday, severely warning those who hoard, speculate, and monopolize rice in the concessions, saying that they will not be protected, or will be deported and their stocks confiscated; and hoping that residents in the concessions will cooperate with the Municipal Council and report any such incidents truthfully, so that they can be punished. Since some unscrupulous people in Shanghai have used rice as a target for speculation, causing the price of rice to rise, the lives of millions of residents have been directly oppressed, and the peace and order of the two concessions have been indirectly affected. This newspaper has repeatedly and earnestly discussed this matter for the past two weeks, saying, "The livelihood of five million residents is entrusted to the hands of speculative merchants; and allowing speculation to go unchecked without sanctions is unique to Shanghai today, in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad." "Shanghai is not without well-organized and well-functioning institutions, but in terms of the market and the people's livelihood, it is in a state of anarchy." Therefore, we advocate mobilizing "the authority of various organizations and institutions to sanction unscrupulous merchants." "Under the premise of the welfare of the residents and the security of the concessions, take all possible methods to apply direct and indirect pressure." "In addition to investigating the amount of rice in stock and the amount arriving in port each day, as well as its purchase price, we should also investigate its hoarding, pledging, manipulation, etc., and investigate the names of the people in charge of the operation; crimes must be punished, and those that cannot be punished by law should be frequently interrogated, and inconveniences should be imposed on their business, residence, life, and related aspects; publicize them, without leaving them any dignity"; and in terms of fundamental solutions, we have advocated clearing the sources, centralizing buying and selling, and ordering foreign rice. Now, the authorities of the two concessions have resolutely adopted severe sanctions, as announced yesterday. This newspaper did not initially think that words had power and public opinion would work; however, among the recent achievements of the concession authorities, this move is the most capable of meeting the urgent needs, benefiting the residents, stabilizing the security, and also the most capable of observing public opinion and greatly satisfying the people.

The Municipal Council's announcement has been posted in thoroughfares and published in yesterday's newspapers; parallel to the announcement, the rice industry has announced price limits. It is reported that, in accordance with the intention of the concession authorities, the maximum price for white japonica rice is limited to 45 yuan per picul, and for indica rice, 38 yuan per picul. This price limit is not explicitly stated in the announcement, but the people secretly discuss that it is too high. Because once the price is limited, rice merchants will regard it as the minimum price of rice; looking at the results of previous price limits, the price of inferior rice has often gradually risen to the limited price. The quality of rice with green waist, white navel, chaff, and gravel forces consumers to seek better and more complete rice grains for cooking, so as to avoid wasting more; then the rice merchants can manipulate and extort by taking the opportunity, saying that if you want good rice, you should pay a higher price, which is a vicious means of indirectly raising prices and causing substantial damage. Consumers can only endure the hidden pain helplessly, and the authorities will also suffer from "there is a reason for the incident, but there is no evidence to investigate," and end up with nothing. Therefore, some commentators say that if Shanghai's food supply still adopts price limits, why not set a wide limit after the old price limit has been newly broken, and why not limit speculation and hoarding to the stage when prices are advancing daily within 40 yuan, but wait until the price of rice has risen to this point before imposing restrictions; this still does not deprive the hoarders of the opportunity to profit, only harms the general public. It is said that this must be because the rice merchants use the reason that high prices are difficult to limit, and must use the "pulling teeth from a tiger" to obstruct the attempt. Not only that, but price limits are only a temporary solution, only able to temporarily curb the rising trend; if there is no management system to regulate it later, then the previous cart will be a lesson, and disrupting the peace will not be difficult; when the third restriction is reached, the price of rice will not know how high it has risen. What's more, rice merchants secretly sabotage, and there are a hundred loopholes, which are difficult to prevent and control. All this, the residents, in addition to praising the concession authorities' resolute measures this time, are still full of worries and doubts.

The people's food supply is an important matter in a government without government, and it is also a huge social problem. If we expect to cure both the symptoms and the root cause with a single notice, and dispel all worries and doubts, that is an excessive hope; if this matter could be solved so simply, then it would not be an important matter, not be a big problem, and this announcement would not have been issued yesterday. It is important to know that although the organizations and institutions in the concessions are large in scale, there is no special agency responsible for the people's food supply, nor is there a reserve of manpower, financial resources, or other necessary material resources. And now, the ability to take strict measures is due to the urgent need in fact, and also because some objective conditions allow for such strictness. Because the inventory in the concessions is sufficient for several months of consumption, there is no worry that unscrupulous merchants will threaten to stop transportation, this is one. The new grain in the rice-producing areas is on the market, which is not comparable to the time when there is a fundamental shortage, this is two. Rice prices in various places are also quite high, which especially makes farmers happy to sell at this time, this is three. The transportation of goods is not smooth, there is no worry that rice will flow out, and the high price of rice is also not conducive to outflow, this is four. Rice is as expensive as pearls and firewood, and complaints are heard everywhere, which has become the most powerful driving force for the concession authorities to punish and warn, and at this time, when punishment is launched, unscrupulous merchants dare not play tricks to resist and disobey, this is five. Only these five points make us believe that the announcement is adapted to the environment, and that the announcement will not ultimately be just a piece of paper.

This single announcement this time will be effective, but it is not the ultimate. I think there must be something to follow the announcement: First, we should reward reports in a timely manner, so that those who hoard and speculate will not dare to act recklessly. Second, we should thoroughly investigate the hoarding of large households in the concessions and selectively levy or confiscate them. Third, we should gradually adopt management measures, investigate the source on a daily basis, centralize the market, publicly evaluate prices, and distribute them to various rice shops. If there is surplus grain, we should use the method of public reserves. Fourth, we should urgently clear the sources and find other ways to provide assistance. Fifth, we should hold the spare house accountable and use its special right to public prosecution to bring those who endanger the public's survival to justice, using criminal law to punish one as a warning to a hundred. Sixth, we should mobilize capable and incorruptible detectives, and specially invite some legitimate people from the industrial and commercial circles, to investigate in various ways whether unscrupulous merchants are selling inferior rice at the highest limited price, or selling better rice at a higher price; if this is the case, we must punish them severely. Seventh, we should urge the warehouses to expedite the withdrawal of stored rice. Eighth, we should urge the financial sector to expedite the repayment of the pledge of rice warehouse receipts, and we will punish them all. In short, we must use the spirit of acting quickly and decisively to achieve the rule of law with thunderous force. We must suppress unscrupulous merchants and not allow them to make plans for speculation, or have any hope of waiting and seeing; if these people see the determination of the concession authorities and the enthusiastic cooperation of officials and people, but seek a small profit and sell out to protect their normal principal and interest, then it is believed that the market price will fall below the limit price, which is very possible.

### Britain and France Block German Trade; Soviet Union Lodges Strong Protest, Believes It Infringes on the Rights of Neutral Countries; Japanese Ship Carrying German Munitions Postpones Departure

Moscow - The British government announced an order on November 28 to block German exports, stating that the British government prohibits all goods from German ports and German products from being transported by sea to other countries through neutral ports. Ships carrying the above-mentioned goods must enter British and French ports, where Britain and France will confiscate or forcibly sell all the goods. Neutral ships carrying goods exported from the ports of countries directly connected to Germany must sail to British and French ports for inspection. Regarding this order, the Soviet government recently sent a note to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union on December 10, protesting against the above-mentioned measures of Britain, believing that they violated the rights of neutral countries. The note first reviewed that the Soviet government had stated on October 25 that it disagreed with Britain's measures to ban war contraband, because it violated international law and disrupted maritime trade. This time, the British government's November 28 order to block German exports further harmed the interests of neutral countries. Britain's method of conducting economic warfare can be said to be unprecedented in the history of international relations and is completely contrary to the provisions of international law. According to this law, when a neutral country imports certain goods from a belligerent country for its own use, no one may prohibit it, regardless of which country the goods are manufactured in. Britain's ban on the export and transshipment of German goods also violates international law. Finally, the Soviet government believes that Britain's demand that all ships sailing from the ports of countries directly connected to Germany must sail to British and French ports for inspection, regardless of which country the goods on board are manufactured, is an arbitrary and autocratic act. Therefore, the Soviet Union hereby protests against the above-mentioned measures of Britain, and reserves the right to demand compensation when Soviet state-owned ships are forced to sail to British and French ports, resulting in losses, or when Soviet foreign trade suffers losses due to Britain's implementation of the November 28 order.

The Hague, Netherlands - The Japanese cargo ship Sanyou Maru (8,000 tons) carrying a batch of German goods was originally scheduled to depart from the Port of Rotterdam on the 9th of this month, pass through the blockade line of the British and French coasts, and sail back to its home country. Until yesterday, a telegram suddenly came from Tokyo, postponing the departure to the 13th of this month. The reason for this is still unknown, but the German side advocates that all neutral countries deal with Britain and France with a "positive neutral attitude," and urgently hopes that Japan will unite with other neutral countries to form an armed group, and hopes that the Sanyou Maru will set sail quickly and try to break through the blockade line of the British and French navies. (Eleventh dispatch from Havas)

London - According to news received here today, what the Japanese steamship Sanyou Maru loaded when it left the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands was entirely German munitions. According to the prediction of the shipping industry here, the Sanyou Maru will probably arrive at Downs, the British inspection base, today. It is unknown whether the British government intends to confiscate these German goods. According to news here, the British Economic Warfare Department has conducted a preliminary investigation of the Sanyou Maru. (Eleventh dispatch from the Associated Press)

### Significant Losses for German Submarines; Construction Can't Keep Up; More British Ships Sunk; Germany Claims Mine Warfare is Legal

London: According to informed sources in London, the current loss rate of German submarines is two to four per week. Although Germany is rushing to build submarines, it may not be able to quickly replenish them. It is impossible to know the exact number of submarines Germany is currently producing or will produce in the future. However, according to German general reports, one submarine was built per day in 1917, and this could be increased. However, according to statistics obtained by the London authorities, the average entry rate of German submarines in 1917 was seven per month, with a maximum of thirteen per month. It is highly questionable whether this number can be achieved now, due to the lack of raw materials, the scarcity of skilled labor, and the large number of workers serving in the military. (Reuters, 10th)

London: Well-informed sources recently stated that British warships and aircraft destroyed at least five German submarines last week, exceeding the official estimate of two to four per week. According to German newspapers, the number of submarines built in that country actually exceeds the number lost. It was said that one submarine could be built per day in 1917, and even more can be built now. However, according to information obtained by the British naval authorities, the facts are not entirely true. Germany could only build four to twelve submarines per month in 1917, with the highest number built in October of that year being only thirteen. As far as the current situation is concerned, due to the lack of raw materials, its construction capacity is even lower than in 1917. Even in terms of the country's overall naval strength, it is smaller than it was in 1917. As such, the major losses suffered by the country in naval warfare are unlikely to be replenished. In other words, the threat of the country's submarine warfare will inevitably become a spent force. (Havas, 11th)

(Havas, 11th)

Netherlands: According to London sources, the British destroyer "Hope" has sunk. The British Admiralty announced that the ship sank yesterday afternoon due to a mine explosion. Four crew members were killed and five are missing. (Haitong, 11th)

London: The Belgian ship "Kapinda," with a deadweight of 5,000 tons, which sailed from Pernambuco, Brazil, back to Antwerp, Belgium, ran aground off the southeast coast of England on the 8th of this month. The ship's keel has now broken, and it is considered a total loss. The 40 crew members and 50 dockworkers who were unloading cargo were all rescued and were not injured. (Reuters, 10th)

London: In the week ending December 9th, seven British ships totaling 33,518 tons were sunk. Eight neutral ships totaling 26.61 tons were also sunk. (Reuters, 11th)

London: Sir John Ambrose Fleming, a British radio expert who has made many inventions in broadcasting, has recently invented a new method of radio transmission and reception, which uses electric light to transmit signals. Anyone who purchases a specially made device can send and receive messages at any time. At sea, ships can communicate with each other or with land not far away, without the risk of leakage. This new invention has been submitted to the Admiralty for inspection. (Havas, 11th)

Berlin: German expert Professor Hats recently published an article in the Berliner Tageblatt discussing Germany's mine warfare against Britain under international law. He stated that Germany's engagement in naval warfare has been criticized for not restricting the scope of the war, especially mine warfare, which does not rely on military targets and does not comply with international law, thus threatening merchant ships. However, in this commercial war, Britain has adopted an escort system, placing ships traveling to and from Britain under military surveillance and military control of port trade, making it impossible to determine which are purely military in nature. Therefore, Germany's engagement in mine warfare cannot distinguish between commercial routes and warship routes. The provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention on mines only require notification of the location of mine obstacles to the extent that it is militarily feasible, and this provision cannot be decided by Britain, but must be deemed appropriate by Germany before the location of mine obstacles can be announced. If British merchant ships continue to fly their national flag at sea according to peacetime practice, Germany is willing to fulfill this provision. Conversely, if the British coast engages in military activities, others can only respond with military countermeasures. Furthermore, the Hague Convention clearly stipulates that belligerents may not place mines on the coast of the enemy country, unless the enemy country engages in obstructing peaceful commercial traffic, in which case it may do so. The military measures taken by Germany are purely to deal with an enemy country that is armed in many ways. (Haitong, 11th)

### Japanese Business Community Urges Negotiations with the U.S.; Hopes to Renew Commercial Treaty

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma stated today that Japanese business and industry leaders have suggested that the government make its best efforts to conclude a new commercial treaty with the United States, or to extend the treaty expiring in mid-January. Suma, who had just arrived here from Osaka and Kobe, said that his remarks could represent the Japanese business and industry community's anxiety regarding the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. Suma also stated that Foreign Minister Nomura had inquired of the Soviet Ambassador on November 28 regarding the prompt negotiation of the Japan-Soviet fisheries issue. The Soviet Embassy has not yet replied. Suma said, "I hope this matter can be resolved satisfactorily. I do not wish to express my opinion on this matter, because the reason for the Soviet Union's delay in replying is unknown." (United Press, 11th)

After discussing and determining the work procedure of the committee, it was adjourned at 6:00 p.m. The next meeting is scheduled to be held on the 11th. (Tass, 11th)

Tokyo: Among the pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, the issue of North Pacific fisheries has become urgent because the current temporary treaty revision period expires at the end of this year. Therefore, Foreign Minister Nomura invited Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin to the Foreign Ministry on November 15th (last month) to propose that Japan and the Soviet Union should promptly begin discussing the fisheries issue. He met with Ambassador Smetanin again on the 28th, urging him to begin negotiations. At that time, Ambassador Smetanin replied that he had not received instructions from his government and therefore could not conduct negotiations, but that he was willing to urge his government to send instructions as soon as possible. However, two weeks have passed and the Soviet side has not yet expressed its willingness to negotiate concretely. On the other hand, Ambassador Togo in Moscow has repeatedly proposed to Foreign Minister Molotov that fisheries talks should begin in Tokyo as soon as possible, but has not received a satisfactory reply. Therefore, Japanese public opinion has gradually become stronger, believing that if the Soviet side continues with this insincere attitude, Japan will have no choice but to take decisive measures to ensure its rights and interests in the North Pacific. Relevant government departments are also preparing to begin discussing countermeasures to deal with this issue in the near future. (Domei, 11th)

### Soviet Offensive Obstructed; Fierce Fighting in Northern Finland; Soviet Union Intensifies Attacks on Narrowest Area; Finnish Batteries Return Fire on Soviet Warships

Helsinki: A communiqué issued here today stated that the Soviet forces continuing their offensive in the Taipale River area have been repelled. Fierce battles are underway in several locations on the eastern border, except for the Petsamo area along the Arctic coast. Several batteries on the islands opposite Koivisto in the Gulf of Finland were bombed by Soviet aircraft. Finnish Air Force bombed a column of advancing Soviet troops, and with the help of field artillery, destroyed a team of tanks and armored vehicles. However, the Soviet communiqué issued in Moscow stated that Soviet forces have advanced three to four miles along all war zones, and have occupied the town of Korojärvi in the Ukhta area and the towns of Poposino and Kirkkomalm in the Karelian Isthmus. (Reuters, 10th)

Helsinki: According to recent front-line reports, Finnish troops are still holding positions at key points. Soviet forces are currently intensifying their attacks on Suomussalmi, which is known as the narrowest area of Finland. It is observed that the Soviet goal is to cut off the Gulf of Bothnia and split Finland in two. Finland has adopted various precautionary plans to prevent the Soviet forces from advancing in this direction. The Soviet side is still transferring reinforcements to the Karelian Isthmus. It is reported that the Soviet vanguard is now about thirty miles from Vyborg. It is rumored that Soviet troops there are still using poison gas. (Reuters, 10th)

Helsinki: The Finnish General Headquarters recently issued a war report stating that the enemy attacked in the Taipale River area (near the Karelian Isthmus) yesterday, the 9th of this month, and was repelled. Their offensive in the east was also contained, but they have a greater advantage in the northern Petsamo port area. Soviet warships have also shelled military locations along the coast, and our batteries have often returned fire. In addition, Soviet Air Force planes dropped bombs on the fortresses of Hanko Island and  Uukos Island, but with little effect. (Havas, 11th)

Helsinki: According to Finnish official sources, Soviet troops attempted to advance along the right bank of the Vuoksi River, but were repelled by Finnish troops. The Soviet Air Force took advantage of clear weather on Saturday to bomb the Koivisto defense area, 27 miles southeast of Vyborg, and Hanko, but there were no reports of damage. The Soviet fleet also shelled areas near the islands. According to news from Kagnas, in the northern Finnish front line, Soviet deaths have reached 9,000. It is said that the Soviet troops advanced too quickly, resulting in insufficient supplies. Last weekend, Soviet troops advanced in several places, entering Finnish territory for up to 30 miles. Soviet troops are currently experiencing food shortages in several places, unable to obtain supplies. (United Press, 11th)

Finnish Side Denies Claim that Finnish Defense Line Has Been Breached

Helsinki: A rumor that the Finnish defense line has been breached by Soviet troops has recently been denied by responsible sources here, who stated that Finnish troops are fighting bravely on the front line, especially in the north, where the fighting is exceptionally fierce. In addition, Soviet troops began crossing the Petsamo River the day before yesterday evening, and will launch a fierce offensive after a large number of reinforcements arrive. Finnish troops are now holding positions on the left bank of the Petsamo River. The heavy losses suffered by Soviet troops in repeated attacks have been confirmed by all parties. The number of officers and soldiers killed has reached more than 4,000, and the number of prisoners is even greater. Five of their tanks have been destroyed by Finnish anti-tank guns in the Karelian Isthmus. (Havas, 11th)

Soviet Troops Attempt to Cut Off Traffic Between Finland and Sweden

Bern: According to news from the Finnish capital, Soviet troops are about to launch a large-scale offensive from the town of Ukhta toward Oulu, a city on the northern side of the Gulf of Bothnia, in an attempt to cut off traffic between Finland and Sweden. Finland has mobilized a batch of reservists in order to strengthen its defenses. (Havas, 10th)

German Side Claims No Military Supplies Shipped to Finland

Berlin: Responsible authorities here stated that since the start of the Soviet-Finnish conflict, no military supplies have been shipped from Germany or through Germany to Finland. Rumors that German military supplies have been shipped to Finland or that Germany has allowed Italian aircraft to fly to Finland via Germany are not true. (Haitong, 11th)

Soviet Aircraft Bomb Hokilab, Finland

Oslo: Soviet aircraft bombed the town of Hokilab, Finland (near the Norwegian border) today, but most of the bombs fell in the middle of the forest, causing minimal damage. According to Finnish sources, the Soviet Red Army has attacked the ports of Petsamo and Salmi twice, but has not succeeded. They have suffered heavy losses, with as many as 500 officers and soldiers killed and 200 captured. Conversely, Finnish troops have suffered little loss and their morale is high. Because Finnish soldiers are mostly skilled skiers, they have been able to win surprisingly and very successfully. (Havas, 11th)

Finnish Troops Holding Extremely Solid Positions

(Karelian Front Line) Finnish troops in the western Karelian region, 50 kilometers from Vyborg, are currently holding extremely solid positions. The terrain is absolutely favorable to the Finnish troops. Therefore, the Finnish military mostly believes that there is no need to retreat to the Mannerheim Line, and that they can hold off the Soviet Red Army through the winter. If the Soviet Red Army advances further, the Finnish military can at any time and place, at a favorable time and terrain, inflict a major blow on the Soviet Red Army. According to today's war news from northern Finland, the Soviet Red Army has begun a fierce offensive in the Samoyed area. At the same time, in the Petsamo area, from 11:00 this morning to 1:00 this afternoon, Soviet aircraft carried out a large-scale bombing. Even in the Norwegian border area, the sound of bombing could be heard, as well as the sound of machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. Although northern Finland is extremely cold today, the weather has cleared up. According to refugees who have fled from northern Finland, Finnish patrols, although small in number, often inflict major blows on large Soviet units. (Reuters, 11th)

Finnish Minister to Soviet Union Discusses Circumstances of Soviet-Finnish Diplomatic Break

Copenhagen: After Finnish Minister to the Soviet Union, Mr. Koskinen, left for home, he told a reporter from the Political News stationed in Helsinki yesterday that the last proposal submitted by our government to the Soviet Union had already made the utmost concessions, even agreeing to withdraw troops from the Karelien Isthmus. However, the Soviet authorities deliberately delayed the transmission of all documents, so that this proposal did not reach the Soviet government, which then declared the severance of diplomatic relations with our country. Since the outbreak of the war, the Soviet people have been greatly shaken, and the Soviet authorities are particularly surprised by the slowness of the Red Army's advance. In fact, this Red Army has been reorganized once, and many of its original excellent officers have been executed, resulting in a significant weakening of its strength. (Havas, 11th)

### U.S. Government Loan to Finland - U.S. $10 Million

Washington: Mr. Jones, Director of the Federal Loan Agency, stated that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Federal Export-Import Bank have been authorized by the President to grant a $10 million line of credit to the "Finnish American Trading Corporation" for the purchase of "surplus agricultural products and non-military supplies" from the United States. The company was formed by Mr. Procope, the Finnish Minister to the United States, and has been registered in the United States with a capital of $1 million, guaranteed by the Finnish National Bank or the Finnish government. In addition, the United States plans to grant a line of credit to Norway. Ambassador Procope also stated that the Finnish American Trading Corporation has now been established and will begin operations within a few days. It is not yet known what goods will be purchased from the United States, but it can be said with certainty that the $10 million loan will be fully used. (Havas, 10th)

### The 20th League of Nations Assembly Opens; Thirteen Member States Absent; Committee Formed to Consider Finnish Appeal

Geneva – At the opening of today's League of Nations Assembly, thirteen of the fifty-three member states were absent. The Chairman announced plans to expedite all meeting procedures so that representatives could return to their countries early. Norwegian representative Hambro has been elected as Chairman of the Assembly, with British Butler, Belgian Wiaux, Canadian Lang, Egyptian Fakry, French Poncet, Greek Politis, Romanian Ronidetes, Portuguese Motta, and Swiss Rappard as Vice-Chairmen. These individuals will form a committee to first consider Finland's appeal. In his speech, Chairman Hambro stated that our gathering is to prevent acts of war between member nations and to protect threatened civilization. The Assembly then adjourned and reconvened in the afternoon. (Reuters, 11th)

Geneva – The 20th League of Nations Assembly opened at 11:30 AM this month. Representatives from forty nations attended, including Poland. The representatives from Afghanistan, Albania, Chile, Panama, and Peru were all absent. The Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Sakolin (Soviet), also occupied a seat on the staff. After the meeting opened, the interim Chairman, Belgian representative Carton de Wiart, delivered a brief speech, stating that the Assembly would discuss a few issues on the agenda, including the application submitted by the Finnish government. However, the shorter the session, the better, and the procedures adopted by the Assembly should be as simple as possible. The Assembly then elected a nine-member committee to review the credentials of the representatives from the participating countries. After the review was completed, the Assembly continued to meet, and the Election Committee proposed the election of Norwegian representative, Hambro, Speaker of the Norwegian Parliament, as the official Chairman of the Assembly, with representatives from Belgium, Britain, Canada, Egypt, France, Greece, Portugal, and Switzerland as Vice-Chairmen. The Assembly immediately approved the proposal. Thereupon, the interim Chairman Carton de Wiart delivered a speech, welcoming the new Chairman, and saying, "The League of Nations has never encountered such dark circumstances as today. But in the future, it may regain its light and strength, and perhaps even be better adapted to all possibilities in international life. As for the present, we can only maintain the League of Nations' activities in technical areas." The newly appointed Chairman Hambro then delivered a speech, stating that a member state, threatened by another member state, had submitted an application to the League of Nations and was bravely defending itself. The Assembly would discuss this application. At this critical juncture, we must take action so that small nations fighting for their independence do not feel disappointed. It is hoped that this Assembly can be the starting point for renewed mutual assistance and solidarity among the peace-loving nations of the world. The Assembly then adjourned at 12:45 PM and decided to reconvene at 4:30 PM. The Presidium was scheduled to meet at 4:00 PM beforehand. (Havas, 11th)

Geneva – According to reliable sources, China will prevent the League of Nations from expelling the Soviet Union. It has notified the British and French delegations that China will not participate in the League of Nations Council meeting scheduled for 11:00 AM today. China's refusal to participate in the League of Nations Council meeting is a mechanical obstruction of Argentina's proposal to expel the Soviet Union from the League of Nations, as such a measure requires unanimous agreement from the Administrative Council. The head of the British delegation, Butler, told a reporter from the Associated Press yesterday that while Britain and France agreed to expel the Soviet Union, "technical difficulties" made a unanimous vote impossible. It is generally assumed that Butler's statement refers to China's refusal to participate in the Administrative Council meeting. The head of the Chinese delegation, Gu Weijun, remained tight-lipped last night about China's attitude towards Argentina's proposal. The Soviet representatives, staying in a hotel, refused to see anyone except German reporters. Italy formally withdrew from the League of Nations yesterday because the two-year notice period for withdrawal had expired. Nevertheless, since the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War, Italy's interest in observing the League of Nations has increased significantly. German and Japanese activities in Geneva are particularly vigorous. German reporters have requested permission to attend the League of Nations Assembly as observers, and some have been granted permission. Japanese activities in Geneva are being led by the Japan International Conference Bureau. (Associated Press, 11th)

London – British government officials stated that the League of Nations Assembly, meeting today, will be able to decide how to assist Finland, but will not impose any sanctions on the Soviet Union, nor will it declare the Soviet Union expelled from the League. Currently, the League of Nations is focused on whether the Soviet Union will further threaten Sweden. (Havas, 11th)

Buenos Aires – Argentine Foreign Minister Cantilo stated yesterday that the external world regards Argentina's intention to withdraw from the League of Nations as a statement that if the League of Nations does not implement sanctions against the Soviet Union, Argentina will announce its withdrawal from the League. This is a purely inaccurate interpretation. The matter of Argentina's withdrawal from the League of Nations has not yet reached a decision stage. However, if the League of Nations' attitude towards the Soviet Union is not in line with Argentina's sanction stance, then measures to withdraw from the League of Nations will be considered. The rumor that Argentina is requesting to be a member of the League of Nations Administrative Council is not accurate, and the Foreign Ministry has already instructed the Argentine representative in Geneva not to accept it. (Haitong, 11th)

General Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army

### Finnish Parliament Issues Two Declarations; Appeals to All Countries for Active Assistance; Encourages the People to Concentrate Strength and Will

Helsinki – The Finnish Parliament has issued two declarations, one to the countries of the world and the other to the nation, with the main contents as follows: (1) The declaration to the countries of the world states, "Our people have always wanted to maintain friendly relations with other countries and have been committed to peaceful work. But at this moment, we have been forced to fight for our country's independence, freedom, and honor, which is deeply regrettable. What we want to defend is not limited to our religion and our motherland, but also includes all things considered sacred by civilized countries. Since the enemy invaded our country, we have resisted alone, hoping to preserve the most precious things of mankind. We will go all out, believing that our position is the outpost of Western civilization, and that civilized countries around the world will sympathize with our plight and actively assist us, and will not allow us to fight alone against a much stronger enemy. With this understanding, we appeal to all civilized countries in the world." (2) The declaration to the nation states, "Now a great power is trying to destroy our country and has launched an aggressive war against us. Fortunately, our soldiers throughout the country have risen up to resist and defend the freedom of the motherland. In recent days, their bravery in combat and the strength of their power have been fully demonstrated. All our soldiers are confident that we will win. The Parliament hereby represents the people of the country and expresses its sincere admiration for the spirit shown by the loyal and courageous soldiers on the front line. In short, the people of our country are now absolutely united, concentrating their strength and will to fight to the end for the motherland and civilization." (Havas, 10th)

### The Times (London) on the Soviet-Finnish Dispute

London – The Times commented today on the Soviet-Finnish dispute in the League of Nations Assembly, stating that the most reasonable ideal path is for member states to decide to unite and resist with force when any one of them is attacked by the Soviet Union, Germany, or other countries. If this were the case, the current war could be quickly ended. It is a pity that this ideal may not be realized. The newspaper then listed the various difficulties that smaller countries have regarding this matter, and stated that Britain and France have always been extremely concerned about the survival of smaller countries, and have joined the war because of this. The guarantee of the safety of smaller countries should not be the responsibility of others. However, Britain and France have now assumed such a major responsibility. If they want to disperse their concentrated strength, so as to affect major military plans, it is clearly unwise. It would be even more foolish to fight with countries stretching from the Baltic Sea to the White Sea. Therefore, the current way to help Finland, apart from actually joining the war, has many aspects. Finland's bravery in combat has been clearly seen by everyone. If Britain and France provide them with a small portion of resources, they can achieve air superiority, and the result may even be to defeat a strong enemy. If you want to help Finland, now is the time. (Reuters, 10th)

### Fierce Battle at the Fujian Border Watershed: Wu Qiwai Pacifies Southern Fujian

Shantou Dispatch, early October: Many puppet troops were transported from Shanghai, Taiwan, and other places to Shantou and stationed in Chenghai, Chao'an, Anbu, and other places. Later, they were assigned by the Japanese army to Huang Dawei and formed into the puppet "Peace and National Salvation Army." In mid-November, Huang led his ugly gang to disturb southern Fujian and renamed it the puppet "Nation-Building Pacification Army," forming the First and Seventh Armies. Huang concurrently served as the puppet First Army Commander, and Wang Tiancai served as the puppet Seventh Army Commander. On the 27th, they concentrated in Chengcheng and advanced towards Zhanglin, Donglong, and Huanggang. On the night of the 28th, Huang's troops camped in Zhanglin. It was reported that they had four or five steel cannons and eight or nine mortars. Platoon leaders and above carried short guns and hand grenades. Soldiers were equipped with six-person, 7.9mm rifles and had red, yellow, blue, white, and black five-color cloth badges wrapped around their arms. Those staying in Lianyang City, Chengcheng, had yellow circular Taiji-shaped symbols. Half of them were unarmed strong laborers, reportedly newly arrested youths from various places. The troops advancing towards the watershed via Huanggang this time numbered no more than three thousand, with seven or eight hundred Japanese soldiers. Wherever they went, they widely distributed leaflets and proclamations specifically targeting the people of southern Fujian and the families of overseas Chinese, talking about how to reorganize Fujian into a "kingdom of righteousness and paradise," with rhetoric just like the Japanese propaganda outline. On the 30th, a fierce battle broke out with the Chinese army at the foot of the watershed. The Japanese and puppet troops, guided by pirates and bandits, advanced from the side of Zhalin Dachen, using two or thirty iron barges and motorboats to land directly at Niuxin Stone in Zhalin. They bypassed the watershed pass from the side of Dajian You. On the 1st of this month, they sneaked into Zhao'an territory and fought with the Shen surname's strong laborers. Six Japanese aircraft covered one thousand Japanese and puppet troops in Huanggang, who attacked the watershed from the front. The Guanyin Temple and ancient artillery fort on the ridge were bombed to the ground. No more than five hundred Japanese and puppet troops entered Zhao'an territory. Wu Qiwai's Chinese army also rushed from Raoping and divided into three routes to intercept them from the seaside. Wang Tiancai's puppet troops in Zhanglin were defeated by Li Shaoru's troops on the 1st and retreated to Lianyang. Japanese troops on the Raoping-Qian road line at Fushan Xiaodong also retreated to Jingzhou at the same time. Huanggang was recaptured by the Chinese army on the night of the 1st. The Japanese and puppet troops retreated again to Zhalin Dachen, which is very close to the coast, and Japanese warships provided artillery cover. Japanese aircraft took turns bombing the mountains on the Fujian-Guangdong border. A great bloody battle is now taking place on the watershed mountain on the Fujian border. The Japanese and puppet troops suffered a rapid waist-cut by the Chinese army this time, with more than one thousand killed or wounded.

Currently, in the mountains of southern Fujian, traitors are active, and rumors are rampant. Wu Qiwai, the Pacification Commissioner of the Guangdong-Jiangxi-Fujian tri-province border area, specially dispatched Chief of Staff Tu Sizong to Longyan, then to Pinghe to set up an office, and posted ten wartime prohibitions in various counties, cities, and towns: 1. Those who illegally organize and impersonate resistance and rescue groups or local self-government will be sentenced to death. 2. Those who cleverly set up names, privately establish checkpoints, and collect transit fees or protection fees for passengers and goods will be sentenced to death. 3. Those who supply bandits with guns and ammunition, harbor smugglers, or secretly organize armed teams will be sentenced to death. 4. Those who harbor bandits, harbor people of unknown origin, or divide the spoils while sitting on the ground will be sentenced to death. 5. Those who provide bandits with rice and salt or secretly hide and sell various stolen goods will be sentenced to death. 6. Those who destroy transportation, communication, or affect anti-Japanese transportation will be sentenced to death. 7. Those who use counterfeit currency or disrupt the financial system will be sentenced to death. 8. Those who abuse their power to detain innocent people or seize property will be sentenced to death. 9. Those who collect reactionary publications and leaflets, spread rumors, or secretly communicate with the enemy as spies will be sentenced to death. The above strict penalties are all aimed at the current situation to suppress reactionaries. The disturbed areas are only within ten miles of the coast, and the power of traitors cannot penetrate the interior.

### Chinese Army in Jiaxing Once Attacked He City, Japanese Army Forced Civilians to Be Puppet Troops

Jiaxing Dispatch: The strength of the Chinese army in the Jiaxing area has become quite strong after being reorganized by the military authorities. Fierce battles have repeatedly occurred in Xincheng, Tongxiang, Puyuan, and other places in the suburbs of He over the past half month, and the Japanese army has been defeated in disarray each time. The Chinese army once launched a fierce attack on He City, but failed to capture the city walls due to the fierce Japanese artillery fire. The Japanese army is now not only actively building artillery positions in the Gao surname's foreign-style house in the South Gate and arranging defensive works in the Zha Yan and Baibuting areas in the North Gate, but also forcibly pulling civilians to serve as puppet troops. Therefore, the residents of He are all panicking, and the market is extremely depressed. The puppet chamber of commerce witnessed this situation and held a meeting to discuss solutions. It was decided that each store in the city would hire 300 laborers to be puppet troops, and all expenses would be borne by the stores and residents.

### Japanese Officers Return in Silence, Officers' Wives Hold Corpse Ashes Waiting for the Train: The Tragic Situation is Inhuman

Special Dispatch from Beiping: A foreigner who traveled from Jin and Sui back to Ping talked about how, due to the active guerrilla warfare of the Chinese army in Jinzhong, the express train on the Ping-Sui Railway now has a "compartment for the remains of Japanese soldiers" attached every day, carrying the ashes of officers and soldiers killed in battle back to their country. Some officers' wives, dressed in mourning clothes and with tears in their eyes, held the wooden box containing the ashes of their deceased husbands in their hands, standing alone at the station in the desolate desert wind. The tragic situation was truly inhuman.

### Chinese and Japanese Armies in the Xuzhou Area Constantly Engage in Fierce Battles, Chinese Army Achieves Victory in Tongshan, Pei County, and Dangshan Counties

Xuzhou Dispatch: The Japanese army in Xuzhou has been repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army, and its railways have been damaged, so it has recently been extremely strict in its defenses. In November, the Japanese army launched a large-scale invasion of eastern Xuzhou, which was repeatedly resisted by Tongshan County Magistrate Guo. It is estimated that on November 17th, County Magistrate Guo led the First and Third Battalions and joined forces with the Budong Liang troops, totaling more than 2,000 people, intending to destroy the Longhai Road and the Tai-Zhao Road. When they arrived at La Fu Mountain on the side of the Tai-Zhao Road, they wanted to join forces with the Picheng Garrison Team to destroy the Tai-Zhao branch road. That night, they ordered the villages to gather laborers to prepare to start work. Unexpectedly, that night, the Japanese in Taierzhuang increased to more than 400, with eight tanks and more than 60 cavalry, and occupied the canal lock in advance. In order to facilitate combat, County Magistrate Guo moved his troops east, with one unit crossing the canal to occupy Yushantou, and the Liang unit stationed west of the canal at Wangmu Mountain to provide support. The next day, the Japanese army indeed moved out in both east and west directions, but did not dare to invade south. County Magistrate Guo then went to Pi County to negotiate with County Magistrate Wang on the matter of thoroughly destroying the Tai-Zhao Road. That night, they also learned that the Japanese army had suddenly increased by more than 100, and the next day, they moved west to coordinate with the Japanese army in Taierzhuang, encircling and attacking the Chinese army. County Magistrate Guo immediately led his troops back to the Heishan area north of Jitang that night and temporarily avoided their advance. At dawn on the 19th, the Japanese army from Taisu and Jisan launched a large-scale attack, searching all the villages. The residences of Guo District Chief, Du Assistant, and Li Battalion Adjutant were all burned and looted. That night, the Japanese army occupied Daxiao Wujia West Village and did not retreat. On the 20th, they continued to attack. Guo then led his troops south across the road that night, temporarily residing in the area and convening a meeting of major battalion commanders to discuss plans to deal with the current large-scale invasion by the Japanese army. The war in eastern Xuzhou has temporarily come to a halt.

Although Pei County City was occupied by the Japanese army, a vast area is still controlled by the Chinese army. The Japanese army has repeatedly tried to mop up, but has failed to succeed. At 8:00 AM on November 19th, more than 80 Japanese soldiers and more than 60 puppet troops in Pei City, along with more than 40 Japanese and puppet troops in Dazhangzhai, took four armored vehicles, two mortars, and several light and heavy machine guns to attack the Menglou area in southern Pei. County Magistrate Feng dispatched the department’s branch captain Zhang Kaiyue and the county general team’s battalion commander Wei Ruizhai to lead the team to resist, encircling and suppressing the enemy on three routes and launching a fierce battle. After four hours, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered heavy losses and all retreated to Menglou Village to resist stubbornly. The Chinese army immediately pressed forward and fiercely encircled and suppressed the enemy. The Japanese and puppet troops were extremely panicked and rushed back to Pei City and Dazhangzhai in cars, carrying more than 80 reinforcements and one heavy artillery to launch another fierce battle. At 4:00 PM, the Japanese and puppet troops were unable to resist and fled in a panic to Zhangzhai. The Chinese army continued to bravely pursue. In this battle, more than ten Japanese and puppet troops were killed and more than thirty were wounded. Three Japanese soldiers’ corpses were left behind, and the Chinese army seized one rifle, one puppet army armband, and many other military supplies. The Chinese army officers and soldiers suffered slight casualties, and company commander Hu Jinlong also suffered glorious injuries.

The Japanese army in Dangshan has been in constant contact with the Chinese army in the past month. County Magistrate Dou Ruishan has engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army five or six times, especially in the three battles of Chenlou, Xiejihu, and Hutun. It is estimated that more than 80 Japanese soldiers were killed, including one captain and three squad leaders, and more than 30 Japanese soldiers were wounded. The Chinese side only had seven killed and more than ten wounded. Wang, the director of the Xuhai Administrative Office, commended the county magistrate for repeatedly inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army and has sent a telegram to commend him.

### Overview of This Year's University Unified Entrance Examination (II): Summary by Section Chief Huang Longxian of the Ministry of Education

(2) Participating Institutions

In addition to all national colleges and universities being included in this year's unified examination, there are also two provincial universities that are being recruited on behalf of, totaling 28 units, 77 colleges, and 301 departments (including three vocational courses). The complexity of the work can be imagined. This year also has two characteristics, namely (1) All national universities and independent colleges are included in the scope of recruitment. Last year, due to environmental reasons, Shanghai colleges and universities recruited on their own. After they were recruited by Shanghai colleges and universities on behalf of the national colleges and universities in the rear, they were assigned to major universities in the rear to study. Although the situation in Shanghai is still difficult this year, a recruitment committee has been organized to conduct recruitment work. This is commendable. However, the environment in Shanghai is still special. Students taking the exam in the inland areas are still not allowed to choose Shanghai schools as their preferred schools. (2) Provincial universities have also joined the unified examination this year. Although Guangxi and Chongqing Universities were also included last year, this year even Henan University, which is far away in western Henan and inconvenient to reach, has joined. Except for provincial independent colleges, all public colleges and universities have completely joined. From these two points of view, it can be seen that the effectiveness of the unified examination has been widely applied to public colleges and universities. The number of colleges and departments included in the unified examination has gradually increased due to the increase in the number of schools. However, the colleges and departments listed this year do not include vocational courses. The reason is that vocational courses are inherently vocational in nature, and the examination subjects of vocational courses such as art are inherently different, and the admission standards are not suitable for being combined with other colleges and departments. Although the situation of physical education vocational courses is similar, the Boy Scout and Physical Education Vocational Courses set up by Central China University and National Teachers College and the Physical Education Vocational Courses of National Chongqing University are still included this year for the sake of saving time and effort. However, the admission standards are different from other colleges and departments.

(3) Examination Subjects

The examination subjects are the essence of the examination. How is the student's level? Is the exam valuable? Examination subjects are the most important factor. Too few subjects do not reveal the student's level well, and too many subjects are overwhelming for the student and unnecessary. The subjects of the unified examination are undoubtedly based on secondary school subjects. However, in the past, each school recruited on its own, and the subjects were inconsistent, so the entrance levels were also extremely uneven. The subjects of the unified examination were determined after long and careful consideration. They are roughly divided into two categories: written examination and oral examination. The oral examination is only used for those who apply to teachers colleges. The written examination is divided into three groups: The first group is for departments of liberal arts, law, and commerce, and for education, civics, physical education, Chinese, English, history and geography, and home economics departments of teachers colleges, and the railway management department of engineering colleges. The second group is for departments of engineering colleges, mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology, and civil engineering departments of science colleges, and mathematics and science departments of teachers colleges. The third group is for departments of medical colleges and agricultural colleges, biology, geography, geology departments of science colleges, and botany departments of teachers colleges. The required subjects for the three groups are all seven. Four of them are completely the same, namely civics, Chinese, English (those applying to Tongji and Sun Yat-sen University Medical College take German), and national history and geography. Mathematics is also included in all three groups, but the difficulty and depth are different. The first group's mathematics includes algebra, plane geometry, and trigonometry. The second group's mathematics A includes higher algebra, analytic geometry, and trigonometry. The third group's mathematics B includes higher algebra, plane geometry, and trigonometry. The other two required subjects that are different for the three groups are foreign history and geography and one of physics, chemistry, or biology for the first group, physics and chemistry for the second group, and biology (those applying for geography take foreign history and geography) and one of physics or chemistry for the third group. In addition, those applying for physical education departments must also take a practical subject test. In addition, the examination subjects are closely related to the candidate's preferences. For example, those who choose Group 2 as their first preference and Group 3 as their second and third preferences must take biology or foreign history and geography, and those who also choose Tongji or Sun Yat-sen University Medical College must take German. Those who choose the above two colleges and universities as their first preference and other schools as their second or third preference must take English. However, the student's preferences are subject to group restrictions. Those who choose the Group 1 colleges and departments as their first preference can only choose other colleges and departments in this group as their second and third preferences. Those who choose the Group 2 colleges and departments as their second preference can choose the colleges and departments in this group and Group 3 as their other preferences, but may not choose any departments in Group 1 as their other preferences. Those who choose the Group 3 colleges and departments as their first preference can only choose other colleges and departments in this group as their other preferences, but may not choose any departments in Group 1 or Group 2 as their other preferences. However, geography departments may also choose the colleges and departments in Group 1 as their other preferences.

(4) Distribution of Test Papers

The problem of test papers is one of the most important things in the examination. The biggest success of this year's unified examination is that the unified test papers have been handled. Originally, in this extraordinary period, when transportation is so difficult, the unified test papers were actually able to be delivered to all test areas before the exam period. It is truly the most satisfying thing. The test papers for the unified examination were selected from several sets of questions in a very meticulous manner. Although there are inevitable places where the difficulty is uneven, it cannot be overstated for the sake of raising the level of students. Moreover, from an academic point of view, the test questions should be difficult and easy. The standards for setting the questions were stipulated by the Ministry of Education in advance, which are (1) The scope and level of the question should be limited to the high school curriculum standards, and the content of the question should be based on the applicable textbooks approved for examination; (2) The number of test questions for each subject should be based on the general candidates' ability to complete the paper within the prescribed time (Chinese, mathematics, English, or German each 3 hours, and the remaining subjects each 2 hours). The test questions should stipulate that students answer all questions and not adopt any optional or selective methods, but the order of the questions can be changed by the students; (3) The Chinese test should include one essay (classical or vernacular), and each translation between classical and vernacular; (4) The English test should include one essay and each translation between English and Chinese (German should be similar); (5) The questions in each subject should not be vague or focus on memory; (6) The physics, chemistry, and biology questions must each have a question testing the experimental procedures. These regulations can be considered reasonable. After the test questions were drafted, they were reviewed by the Ministry of Education, secretly handed over to the chairman of the Unified Enrollment Committee for strict printing, and the Minister and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education personally supervised the printing. After printing, the Ministry of Education sent a special commissioner to deliver the test papers to each enrollment area and hand them over to the chairman of each area for strict printing, sealing, and storage for use. The meticulousness of the procedures can be imagined. This year, the test papers were sent out in five routes due to traffic and time constraints: (1) Chengdu, Nanzheng, Zhenping, and Lanzhou areas; (2) Guiyang and Chenxi areas; (3) Kunming and Shanghai areas; (4) Guilin, Qujiang, Taihe, Yongkang, and Yanping areas; (5) Enshi area. For the sake of speed, most of them departed by plane. The special commissioner who delivered the questions to the last area must also be responsible for supervision. The Ministry of Education's emphasis on this matter is evident. In addition, in order to prevent air raids or leakage of test questions during the examination, each area may independently prepare a set of test questions for each subject for use in case of emergencies.

### Ministry of Education Examines Education Broadcasting and Radio Reception in Various Provinces

(Chongqing Airlines News) The Ministry of Education is actively promoting broadcasting education. In addition to subsidizing equipment, it is also strictly examining its radio reception. Recently, it ordered the education departments and bureaus of various provinces to follow the Ministry Order No. 13212 issued in September 24th year of the Republic of China to distribute the Monthly Report Form for Listening to Education Broadcasts, which was issued to its subordinates. The radio receiving institutions to which the ministry issued equipment were ordered to fill out one copy each month, one copy of which was retained by each department and bureau for reference, and one copy was submitted to the ministry for verification. If a subordinate radio receiving institution fails to fill out the report for three consecutive months, the departments and bureaus will take back the receiver that the institution received and redistribute it, and the responsible personnel will be given appropriate punishment and reported to the ministry for verification. If the number of institutions reported by each department and bureau within three months is less than two-thirds of the total number of subordinate radio receiving institutions in each province and city, the subsidies for broadcasting education in that province and city for the next year will be suspended.

### Food: Authorities Crack Down on Manipulation; Rice and Grain Speculators Slightly Subdued; Market Prices Drop by One to Two Yuan; Foreign Rice Prices Arrive at Over 18,000 Bags

Since rice prices soared, the livelihood of the common people has become extremely painful. Now that the concessions have strictly cracked down on speculative manipulation of the bean and rice industry association and implemented strict price limits, speculators and those engaged in speculation have disappeared, and rice prices have stabilized immediately. Although the inland supply yesterday still only had six or seven cars of goods arriving near the Sujia Road area, because manipulation was impossible, outsiders disappeared, and only general stores actually added a little bit of purchases. However, since sales were low, not only could they not rise again, but the general speculators, having lost their support, threw out their holdings, and the spot goods returned to the market, becoming abundant, supply exceeding demand, so they had to dump prices and compete for sales. The market was difficult to stand firm and went downstream step by step. Until the close of the market, if the prices of Japonica and Yinyuan had fallen by one or two yuan compared with the previous market, the regular Japonica had been limited to 45 yuan, and all other Japonica had entered the limit at around 40 yuan. However, the city's transactions were still very few. Looking at the overall trend, people's hearts have declined, and there may be a possibility of further decline.

Customer Indica rice has arrived in small quantities, and transactions in the market are mostly retail and less wholesale. However, the market is affected by the decline in Japonica rice, so people's hearts are also soft. Yesterday, the selling price of Jiangbei tip was 37.5 yuan to 37 yuan, and the selling price of Wuhu tip was 37.3 yuan to 36.8 yuan, a drop of 60 to 70 cents compared to the previous market.

Foreign rice is still priced high, so merchants have no intention of renewing their orders, and the road goods transactions have gradually turned quiet. Although some floating households are seeking to get rid of their holdings, the market decline is slower. A total of more than 1,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were traded in the unified market, priced at 38 yuan to 37.5 yuan, slightly smaller than the previous market by 50 to 60 cents. It has been found that 18,000 bags have arrived in port.

### Supply Blocked; Wheat Sees New Prices Repeatedly; Afternoon High at 14 Yuan; Rice Prices High, Leading to Flour Price Increases

The source of wheat yesterday and the day before was still sparse, because the goods arriving by car were blocked and not allowed to be directly transported into the concession, resulting in a scarce supply in the market. Holders, due to the high price of flour mills, sold at better prices. Even a small number of social engagements were sold at prices no less than 14 yuan. In the morning market, three cars of Kunshan wheat were traded at 13.7 yuan. In the afternoon, the market became more popular, and the manufacturers also released prices to buy, eating the plate to a new high price of 14 yuan. Fuxin handled 5,000 bags, and Fufeng handled 8,000 bags.

The flour mill plate rose another 10 cents yesterday, and the wholesale price of No. 2 flour has been changed to 8.4 yuan. This is because recent sales have improved significantly, all affected by the high price of rice. More common people are eating flour. If the rice price is 45 yuan, the flour price is still cheap. In addition, the price of wheat raw materials has repeatedly soared, so people's hearts are all upward, and the return goods are more popular. The green gun car stack list opened to 8.89 yuan, and its rising wind can also be seen. A total of about 40,000 bags were traded in the unified market. It was found that the trading of the Japanese factory's Phoenix brand flour in December continued to be lively, because it was emphasized by general speculators. The morning initially opened at 8.3 yuan, and soon returned to 20 to 45 cents. It is said that January also opened, priced at 8.65 yuan.

### Finance: Chinese Merchants Continue to Sell Foreign Exchange

The foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listing, did not go up or down, the British and American exchange black market, the situation was mediocre, slightly loose in the quiet, although the Hong Kong telegram and yarn flower gangs sold out in the middle, but it was offset by HSBC eating in and a part of Chinese merchants following suit, so the result was only a slight loosening. As for the day's process, the morning opened with the British slightly soft, and the American reported flat. After the opening, the market was dull, and only Chinese banks sold out slightly, but there was no change. Until about 11 o'clock, Hong Kong suddenly sent a telegram to sell, and at the same time, the yarn flower gang also followed up and sold slightly, so it loosened to four office soldiers 53125, and 7 yuan 4375. Among them, because HSBC ate in a lot, a part of Chinese merchants followed up and grabbed the distant month, so the market image slightly returned to flat, closing at four office soldiers and a half and seven yuan 34375. The afternoon state was even more silent, the British gold did not change, and the American exchange was slightly soft because Chinese merchants continued to grab the distant month, but the result was still reported at four office soldiers and a half and seven yuan 34375 closing price, (combined British and American exchange rate of 3 yuan 90 cents 1 point 6 li 2), compared to last weekend, the British loosened 015625, the American hardened 6 5, as for the futures trend, it is similar to the spot.

Hong Kong Sells Out, HSBC Buys In

In the early morning, there were no telegrams from London's large bars and American bank prices. London's raw gold was fixed, the exchange rate of British to American, to Shanghai, to France was flat, American to British did not change, to Shanghai dropped by 5 cents, to France small 625. The central listing of each exchange was as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was British gold four office soldiers 46875, American exchange 7 yuan 28125, compared to Saturday, the British softened 015625, the American had no honor or disgrace. After the opening, the situation was fixed, and the transaction was rarely heard. Until HSBC's listing was announced, there was no change, and the announcement of the silver balance tax also had no rise or fall. After that, Chinese banks slightly came to spit to foreign banks spot American exchange 7 yuan 3125, the state was still stable. As such, until about 11 o'clock, Hong Kong telegram suddenly came to spit out, and the yarn flower gang's bulls also came out of the cage, although at that time HSBC still had a stomach, but also took the opportunity to raise the price, so the market situation loosened. It is estimated that Hong Kong Telecom sold to HSBC and other foreign banks spot British gold four office soldiers half and five 15625, and spot American exchange 7 yuan 375 and 4375. At the same time, the yarn flower gang also spit out to Datong a bank and other this month's American exchange 7 yuan 34375 and 406 5. Later, the spot British gold buyer once returned four office soldiers 53125. At noon, the selling wind had stopped, and some Chinese merchants, seeing HSBC's buying in, came to follow suit, so the market image suddenly returned slightly to flat. It is estimated that speculators grabbed favorable January American exchange for 7 yuan 25. Extending to the afternoon close, the bank's spot selling price, British gold four office soldiers half, American exchange 7 yuan 34375, compared to the morning opening, the British returned to loosen 03125, the American hardened 0625.

Speculation Slightly Ends, January Period

The market situation in the afternoon reported a father's silence, and the transaction was also extremely clear. Initially, because Chinese merchants came to grab the distant month again, the American exchange once slightly softened, but the British gold was fixed at four office soldiers half.

Opening Special Edition of the Dahua Grand Theater

### Welcoming Guests

Metabolism is a universal law of nature. In science, new and important inventions replace old dross. In major cities, new buildings are constantly being constructed for the same reason, with the new replacing the old.

In Shanghai, where population density has reached its peak, the need for a modern, scientifically advanced cinema is undeniable. The Far East Theater Company has taken on the responsibility of meeting this need by transforming the former Summer Theater, which has a considerable history in cinema, into a theater at the forefront of the times.

The eyes are the most impartial witnesses, and the mouth is the most faithful reporter. While welcoming our guests, we respectfully invite each guest to take a thorough tour with their eyes and to provide an objective report with their mouth.

The most important issue for a cinema is "safety first," followed by "convenience" and "comfort." Our theater's emergency exit facilities are perhaps the highest in Shanghai. Downstairs, there are three emergency exits leading to Rue Victor, and four leading to Bubbling Well Road; upstairs, there are three leading to Bubbling Well Road, and one leading to Rue Victor, for a total of eleven emergency exits, which is more than adequate for managing crowded audiences safely.

Public bus and tram stops are close by. There are four major roads for parking private cars: Bubbling Well Road, Xiaoxiao Lane, Route Doumer, and Rue Victor, which meet the meaning of the word "convenience." As for "comfort," it seems unnecessary to say more; let the guests make a fair judgment.

During the progress of the construction project and the compilation of this publication, we have received significant assistance, both directly and indirectly, from various parties. Here, we express our sincere gratitude to all parties with the utmost sincerity. And to the guests who have graciously come today, we extend our welcome and thanks with the utmost sincerity!

### Sound, Light, and Seating - A Brand New Appearance - The Latest Equipment

The structure of a theater requires a sound organization, which is undoubtedly true. The so-called "heavenly timing," "geographical advantage," and "human harmony" are indeed necessary conditions. In addition to these three elements of heaven, earth, and man, the three beauties of sound, light, and seating are also interconnected. When establishing a new theater, while a beautiful exterior is certainly worth attention, its heart—the sound, light, and seating—must be given even greater importance. The Dahua Grand Theater opens today, and while we dare not boast that we have achieved perfection in the aforementioned three aspects, we have at least kept up with the times by adopting the most modern equipment, using facts as solid proof.

Coming to a cinema to watch a film means sitting and enjoying everything in front of you. The importance of the seating for the audience is closer than anything else, especially when sitting still for two hours, it is difficult to guarantee that your back, legs, and thighs will not experience numbness. The Dahua's seats, whether upstairs or downstairs, use the same type of construction, with the diameter and width of the seat specially widened, and the position of the installation lowered. The number of springs in the cushions has been increased, and they provide balanced elasticity according to each person's weight. Sitting down, they are soft and comfortable, giving the body and mind supreme pleasure, and avoiding the drawbacks of back pain from prolonged sitting. For this reason, the theater has sacrificed a considerable number of seats, but conversely, this sacrifice is worth it for the sake of the audience.

The Magnificent Appearance of the Dahua Grand Theater

The screen is the focal point of the audience's sightline, and the first requirement is that the light be bright and soft. On ordinary screens, the surface is covered with small holes, and when light is projected onto it, the strong light passes through the holes, damaging the brightness of the light. The Dahua uses the latest American-invented "no-hole" screen, which eliminates the above-mentioned drawbacks. The brightness is undiminished, as white as snow and as soft as velvet.

The sound system is the latest type of orthophonic machine from Altec Lansing, which produces sound that is no different from the original sound of the speaker. The dense, automatic light box further enhances the effect of lighting and sound. The projector is also a newly invented one used for the first time: the Ventzel "Ace" projector, whose effectiveness has been proven in major cinemas in the Americas, with no unevenness in light intensity or interruptions. The sound-absorbing paper on the four walls can enhance the sound's progress and reduce the interference of echoes, so that everyone's vision and hearing are completely satisfied.

Controlling the air conditioning and heating is a state-of-the-art air conditioner that extracts dirty air and delivers fresh, clean air. The exquisite foyer, the beautiful dressing rooms, and the quiet tea room provide everyone with great convenience. The color scheme inside and outside the theater, the artistic paint colors, and the crystal-clear artificial stone floor create an atmosphere of beauty and luxury, as if you were entering an imperial palace and witnessing the work of the gods.

Every corner reveals a new pattern, and every brick and tile uses new ingenuity, using the minds and efforts of many people to irrigate this new building, hoping that every audience member will have a satisfactory enjoyment and the highest entertainment.

### A Miracle in Film History - WOMEN - Without a Single Man - Reveals the Inner Suffering of Women - Scratches the Itch in Women's Hearts

Women are the driving force behind all subversion in the world. How many emperors have been overthrown by the allure of women, and how many great men have succeeded through the encouragement of women. Men cannot live without women for a moment, and women cannot live without men for a moment. This film, "Women," however, forms a new style, without a single man participating in it, but the progress of the plot at every moment cannot escape the constraints and scope of men.

Starring are Norma Shearer, MGM's leading lady, along with Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, and Paulette Goddard, for a total of 135 women. It depicts women's daily lives—beauty treatments, hairdressing, bathing, massage, manicures, shopping—outlining a clear picture, drawing out a general tragicomedy of tears and laughter from the idle gossip over eating well and staying warm. Every bit of idle talk confirms what women usually say; every stimulus scratches the itch in women's hearts, and women cannot help but nod with a smile.

The entire performance is full of preciousness and wealth, with 237 gorgeous new outfits. Norma Shearer alone changes into twenty-four new outfits, Paulette Goddard's fur coat, Joan Crawford's hair bun, and precious jewelry will undoubtedly stir the attention of all Shanghai ladies. The fashion show scene is dyed in natural five colors, adding indescribable beauty. Joan Crawford's bathtub bathing scene broke the record for filming, taking eleven hours to shoot. For this scene, Joan Crawford slept for two days to recover her fatigue and rejuvenate her nerves.

A fight between Paulette Goddard and Rosalind Russell is a brilliant scene in the film, revealing women's abnormal psychology, grabbing hair and wrestling, rolling around on the ground, and finally, with itchy teeth, tearing women's trousers and biting a white and jade-like powder leg, expressing all the psychology of jealousy in these few actions.

Character descriptions include the gentleness of a deer, the docility of a sheep, the cunning of a monkey, the suspicion of a fox, the insidious nature of a night hawk, the straightforwardness of a horse, and the stupidity of an ox. "Women" is the surgeon's operating room for women's clinical experiments, showing their pathological conditions on the screen without mercy, making you blush and also making you willingly submit.

Rosalind Russell is the most outstanding person in the whole drama. Her style has completely changed, playing the role of an antagonist, with a posture of posing and modulating her tone, and a mouth full of garrulous idle talk, making people both angry and amused. She is the black fish spirit in the goldfish bowl, causing unrest in the six houses and disturbing the peace of the chickens and dogs.

### Film Stills - Every One is a Film You Want to See

Films are the main blood vessels of a cinema, holding the soul of the entire theater. They have the power to draw a large theater full of people, without any gaps. Therefore, the most difficult core problem for a cinema to solve is the film itself, especially for a newly established cinema, which adds another layer of difficulty.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) is the largest film company known to all film fans, with twenty-five male and female stars. The most famous actresses include Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, Jeanette MacDonald, Myrna Loy, Ilona Massey, and Joan Crawford; the most famous actors include Clark Gable, William Powell, Wallace Beery, Robert Taylor, James Stewart, Nelson Eddy, and Fred Astaire. They are all the basic pillars of MGM, and each film they make is worth watching. It maintains the most glorious page in film history, and its Leo the Lion logo has become the king of all films.

At the time of its establishment, Dahua signed a long-term contract for the exclusive screening of MGM films with lightning speed, which is undoubtedly a major good news for film fans. To screen the world's best first-line films in Shanghai's newest first-line cinema can be said to be a rare and beautiful event.

Robert Donat's "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is an educational epic worth celebrating. The greatest achievement is Donat's acting skills, which have reached the pinnacle of apotheosis. He portrayed the gestures and actions of transitioning from adolescence to adulthood vividly. Finally, in his old age, his steps changed, his speech became more humorous, and his voice suddenly became old. No one believed that such a role was played by him alone from beginning to end.

The content and significance of this film not only declares that the old educators are loyal to education for life and tirelessly train their disciples, but also encourages everyone to be loyal to the country. He, with the qualifications of an old retiree, re-shoulders the full responsibility of education in the war-torn country, which is deepening the national crisis. Even on the night of the Great Bombardment, he remained calm and chose humorous jokes to dispel the atmosphere of terror. This courage and fortitude is worth everyone learning from.

To describe the excellence of "The Wizard of Oz," a brilliant writing brush would lose its effect. Only by witnessing it with your own eyes can you solve this difficulty. There are many things inside that cannot be described in words.

The various miracles of riding the clouds and driving the fog, flying sand and rocks, ten thousand rays of fog light, ten-foot demon fire, calling the wind and rain, and immortals fighting magic in mythology are all brought to the screen in this "The Wizard of Oz" by using the omnipotent power of science and vividly expressed. The characters appearing include the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, and the Wicked Witch. In the mysterious myth, there is a story that fits life, not fearing difficulties, not fearing death, not surrendering, and achieving final victory, which is exactly what the film implies.

The capital used exceeds any MGM epic, costing a total of three million U.S. dollars. Producer Mervyn LeRoy has a wide reputation, and his masterpieces include "Little Caesar" and "Anthony Adverse." The director is George Cukor, who made "Little Women," and is famous for his clear methods and tight layout.

The entire film is dyed in beautiful natural five colors, with as many as five thousand actors. Starring Judy Garland, the recently rising singing child star, she had a very wonderful performance in "Pigskin Parade," and this film has even more surprising results. "The Wizard of Oz" can be counted as the first five-color epic with the largest cost this year.

Many tragic histories have been caused by misunderstandings between men and women in the world, wounding many hearts. "Sweethearts" writes about a pair of secretly married artists who hid their marriage for a long time due to professional problems. When the woman becomes famous, the man misunderstands and leaves. Lamenting separation and reunion, it marks the beginning of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness covering the screen.

Jeanette MacDonald's loyalty to art is a fact that no one can deny. She plays the poor artist in this drama with a very exquisite performance. From making a name for herself through performing, heartbreak, separation, and reunion, she expresses her love and affection for her husband at all times through her eyebrows and eyes, making people pity, rejoice, grieve, and sympathize, constantly stirring the emotions of the movie audience to an unknown state. The entire film focuses on performance and is supplemented by singing, which is the best method for film producers to cater to the audience's psychology. MacDonald's singing voice has always been honored as a golden voice, and with her serious performance, the entire film is touching and makes people feel indescribably uncomfortable.

The male lead, Nelson Eddy, established ten times his reputation in "All Quiet on the Western Front." This time, he made a comeback, paired with MacDonald, and also had a very superb performance, conveying the psychology of loving each other, and being both jealous and hateful, expressing it completely.

### Commemoration of President Chiang's Ordeal - All Circles Advocate the廉恥(liánchǐ) Movement

All circles in this city, commemorating the third anniversary of President Chiang's Xi'an ordeal today, currently value the period of resistance war and nation-building. Citizens of the isolated island should show something for this significant commemoration, and it has been decided to start promoting the lianchi (廉恥, integrity and honor) movement from today, in order to encourage oneself and others. The tenets of this movement are recorded as follows:

Sincere Unity, Sacrifice for the Country

Our China is the earliest country to promote world culture. For five thousand years, it has respected morality, and the deeds of loyalty and dedication have been continuously recorded in history. The non-diminishment of the nation and the independence of the country depend on this great spirit. Since the War of Resistance, the soldiers at the front and the civilians in the rear have been united with sincerity and sacrificing for the country. With justice upheld and the enemy contained, if we can be of one mind and one heart, enduring and unyielding, then not only can we be confident of final victory, but the future of nation-building will also receive boundless prosperity. This is an immutable truth and is also demonstrated by the facts.

Diligent Self-Improvement, Perseverance and Struggle

With the national army withdrawing westward, the citizens of the isolated island, although temporarily losing the protection of the government, still share honor and disgrace, survival and death. How should we diligently improve ourselves, persevere and struggle to recover our land and rescue those in dire straits? Looking around at the current situation, while there are many who are loyal, unwavering, and enterprising, there are also not a few who are declining in will and falling in character. It must be known that freedom and happiness can only be obtained through difficult struggles. Without thorough resistance, we can never win national independence and guarantee the survival of ourselves and our future generations. The eight-year war of the United States and the ten-year plan of the Soviet Union can be used as examples. Historical evidence is clear and undeniable.

Self-Initiated Correction, Promote Integrity and Honor

We, who serve in all circles, are ashamed of our lack of achievements, but our love for the country has not diminished. We believe that the current unfortunate phenomenon, although there are many reasons, is mainly due to the ancient customs and the loss of integrity and honor. If we want to correct ourselves spontaneously, it is best to cultivate integrity and honor. For only by cultivating integrity can we be selfless and devoted to public service, and only by understanding honor can we be inspired to strive for strength. Therefore, respecting morality and promoting integrity and honor are the most urgent plans and fundamental strategies for completing the great cause of resistance and nation-building. Nothing surpasses this. Therefore, we gather like-minded people, based on the meaning of encouraging self-improvement and initiating a movement to promote integrity and honor, in order to save the crisis and revive the nation. Patriotic compatriots, why not come? If we are fortunate enough to be taught by virtuous scholars from home and abroad, it would be even more fortunate.

### Supply Committee Discussed Yesterday Further Lowering Rice Prices, Waiting for a Considerable Time Before Further Stabilization, The Guild Suggests Purchasing Large Quantities of Foreign Rice, Planning a Second Round of Price Stabilization

The Bean and Rice Industry Association previously sent a letter to Yu Qiaqing, requesting that he handle the price stabilization according to the previous application for foreign exchange, to further relieve the people and stabilize rice prices. According to a well-informed source speaking to a Datong News Agency reporter last night, this action will be taken next week, after a certain influential figure in the local business community consults with the banking community. The method may involve cooperation between important groups in Shanghai to jointly bear the expenses, and the banking community will advance these funds first. As for applying for legal foreign exchange, a decision will also be made on that day and telegraphed to the central government for approval.

The Food and Fuel Supply Committee of the Public Works Department held a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 11th). Attendees included Sir Maher (Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce), Mr. Aveline (Manager of Daofu Foreign Firm), Mr. Hatton (Manager of Taigu Foreign Firm), and the heads of the PWD's finance, police, and sanitation departments. According to inquiries made by a Xinsheng News Agency reporter, the meeting conducted a detailed review of the current market conditions after the rice price limits were imposed, paying particular attention to how the restrictions have been implemented by various parties. The meeting also thoroughly discussed the issue of further lowering the current price limits (i.e., the highest price for white粳 rice should not exceed 45 yuan, and the highest price for 秈 rice and foreign rice should not exceed 38 yuan) after a certain period. All attendees showed great enthusiasm for safeguarding the food supply for the city's residents. It is reported that the result of the discussions was a decision to strictly enforce the price limits stipulated in the announcement, while also further examining inventory and rice arrivals, in order to achieve the original intention of lowering rice prices and benefiting the people. According to the Wenrenmei Evening News, Mr. Felippucci, Director-General and President of the PWD, paid a private visit to the Central Consulate General at 10:30 AM this morning (the 11th). Mr. Felippucci declined to comment on the purpose of his trip. However, many believe that Mr. Felippucci was discussing the current development of the rice situation with officials from the Wu Consulate General.

Reasonable Price Stabilization and Re-establishment of Price Limits

The announcement by the Concession authorities prohibiting rice hoarding, speculation, and manipulation has been posted by the respective police departments in various locations yesterday, informing all citizens. The announcement consists of two versions, one in Chinese and one in English. Citizens from all walks of life paid close attention to this announcement, standing to read it carefully and expressing strong support for the authorities' measures. It is reported that the Concession authorities are determined to strictly enforce the newly established rice price limits. Any further hoarding or manipulation will be severely punished. Rice prices have already fallen slightly yesterday, and it is expected that they will continue to decline. According to well-informed sources, the current price limits are intended as a temporary emergency measure. When rice prices fall to a natural level, the current price limits will be further lowered, ensuring that rice prices become more stable over time.

Rice Merchants' Reaction to the Authorities

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reports that local rice merchants have been in an uproar today (the 11th) over the announcement issued by the French Concession Municipal Council and the Public Concession Public Works Department regarding hoarding and manipulating rice. They believe this announcement is self-defeating. These people want to know why the announcement does not mention coal or rent, etc. A certain rice merchant told a reporter today that what authority does the PWD have to confiscate the legally stored rice of merchants? If this happens, rice merchants will be alarmed and will stop importing rice, and the increase in rice prices is due to the taxes collected by the Japanese along the way. Why does the announcement only mention rice, while other foods, as well as coal and rent, are not mentioned? This morning, the reporter asked a PWD official about what authority the PWD has to confiscate stored rice. The official replied that there is no such provision in the law, but the PWD can do so under its inherent emergency powers. The Bureau hopes that such a necessity will not arise.

Thoroughly Punish Rice Merchants Who Violate Orders

The reporter asked, what kind of compensation will be given for confiscated rice? The spokesperson replied that this matter has not been considered, but if such a situation occurs, then this point will naturally have to be considered. The reporter also asked, why doesn't the PWD curb the high prices of other items such as coal and rent? The spokesperson replied that the PWD considers rice to be the most obvious example. In the future, the Bureau may have no choice but to curb the high prices of other items. The reporter then asked, how will the PWD expel rice merchants from the Public Concession? The reply was, by putting them on a ship heading to Vietnam. This statement indicates close cooperation between the Bureau and the French authorities. The spokesperson also said that although the PWD understands that rice is being extorted for taxes outside the city, it believes that the selling price of domestic rice is too high, because speculators are setting the price of domestic rice based on the price of Saigon rice.

Suggest Chamber of Commerce Group Purchase Rice

In addition to sending the previously reported, agreed-upon fundamental and short-term solutions to the Public Concession Public Works Department and the French Concession Municipal Council for their consideration, the Bean and Rice Industry Association also suggested that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce organize the group purchase of foreign rice. The original letter states, "Respected Sirs, Recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has been increasing incessantly, which is of great concern to the people's livelihood and public security. We should find ways to remedy this situation in order to achieve balance. The Association convened a meeting of its executive and supervisory committee on the ninth of this month, and decided on various fundamental and short-term solutions. Regarding short-term solutions, we accept the Public Works Department's suggestion to re-establish price limits. Regarding fundamental solutions, we request that the authorities of the two concessions find ways to dredge the sources of supply, etc., which will not be elaborated on here. What must be submitted to your esteemed association is the following: (1) Mr. Yu Qiaqing previously initiated a group purchase of foreign rice, but the matter did not come to fruition. Now, in order to ensure an adequate food supply for the people, it is still advisable to order foreign rice. Although there are a small number of rice businesses ordering, their strength is still weak and their effect is minimal. We propose that your association, together with the authorities of the two concessions and Mr. Yu, invite representatives from various public organizations to discuss and separately organize group purchase methods, ensuring that each public organization aggregates the needs of its affiliated companies, firms, factories, and freelancers, and orders in large quantities. If so, the strength will be great and the effect will be significant. With an adequate food supply for the people, we will not have to worry about rice prices not being stable. (2) Currently, the high price of rice is most painful for the common people. Mr. Yu previously obtained approval for a legal foreign exchange to order foreign rice and conduct price stabilization sales. Although the amount was not large, the poor have benefited not shallowly. Now, we propose that your association, together with Mr. Yu, follow the previous example and submit another request to the Ministry of Finance to approve the allocation of a certain amount of legal foreign exchange, approximately enough to order 50,000 bags of foreign rice. At the same time, we will ask the banking industry to advance funds for procurement, so that we can conduct price stabilization sales again to help the poor. (3) Currently, the price of rice is expensive, and the cost of procurement and transportation has doubled. To increase the supply of goods, it depends on having sufficient financial resources. Therefore, we propose that your association inform the banking industry to provide as much loans as possible to those who purchase domestic or foreign rice in order to increase procurement and transportation and increase supply. The above three matters are indeed the most important plans at the moment. We hope that you will adopt them and implement them quickly, so that rice prices can be balanced and the people's livelihood can be stabilized. We respectfully address the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce." In addition, a letter was sent to Yu Qiaqing to assist in handling the matter, with similar wording.

Market Stabilizes as Foreign Rice Continues to Arrive

Yesterday was the second day of the Public Works Department's price limit implementation in the Rice Industry Tea House Market. Mr. Fu Qian'geng, Chairman of the Market Management Committee, as well as the duty committee members Mr. Zhang Lizhong and Mr. Zheng Shengyun, and the supervisory personnel assigned by the two concession authorities, all arrived at the market to monitor transactions among the traders. Also, because the authorities of the two concessions have severe penalties for those who speculate and monopolize rice, such as not protecting them or expelling them from the country, and confiscating their inventory, market transactions are becoming more stable, and those who sell short and buy long to make profits are also disappearing. According to a certain rice merchant, in addition to the foreign rice previously ordered by Shanghai rice merchants arriving in Shanghai in succession, another 40,000 bags of Saigon rice arrived yesterday, shipped by the Ma Le Wheel to Shanghai. Currently, the foreign rice that has been ordered by various rice merchants but has not yet been shipped to Shanghai totals 300,000 bags. If the ordered foreign rice can arrive in Shanghai within a week, then the Shanghai market will see an even more abundant supply of foreign rice.

### Da Xin Dispute Resolved, Xian Shi Went on Strike Yesterday, The Public Works Department Has Sent Personnel to Mediate, Labor and Management Can Negotiate a Solution

Since the prices of goods in Shanghai have soared and rice is as expensive as pearls, the people's livelihoods have been affected. Recently, employees in the industrial and commercial sectors have successively requested employers to appropriately increase their salaries in order to maintain their livelihoods. Fortunately, both labor and management have been able to understand the current difficulties, and thus have been able to find appropriate and fair solutions based on the principle of coordination. Only the employees of Da Xin Company briefly went on strike on [date] because their demands were not met at that time. Afterwards, it was resolved satisfactorily and business resumed as usual yesterday. In addition, more than 700 employees of Xian Shi Company continued to go on strike yesterday morning. The company authorities said that they had telegraphed the Hong Kong headquarters for instructions. In general, if the management can accept their opinions, it is expected that a solution can be reached immediately. The details are recorded below:

Xian Shi Employees on Strike Yesterday

More than 700 middle and low-level employees of the Xian Shi Company on Nanjing Road sent representatives twice on the eighth and ninth to visit the authorities, requesting the restoration of pre-war work compensation and the distribution of year-end profit bonuses, a temporary rice allowance of five yuan, and effective job security, etc., for the sake of stabilizing their lives during this period of skyrocketing prices. Their requests were not adopted by the authorities. During this negotiation period, the commercial center operated as usual. After the company stopped operating at 8 PM the night before, they sent representatives to visit the authorities for the third time, but were still not accepted. All employees officially went on strike yesterday morning.

Branch Staff Respond Enthusiastically

In addition to the Nanjing Road headquarters, Xian Shi Company also has two branches located on Xialfei Road and Jing'an Temple Road. After receiving notice of the headquarters' strike in the morning, they also decided to close and participate. At about 9 AM, they went to the Nanjing Road headquarters one after another to discuss solutions. Upon hearing the news, the police also dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to station there. Except for the side door on Zhejiang Road, which could still be used for entry and exit, the iron gates at all entrances of the commercial center were sealed off. The side door could only be used for exit and not entry. Even employees of the company could not enter or exit freely. Without a special pass from the police, there was no room for compromise. Therefore, dozens of employees who went from the branch stores were rejected outside the door.

Sympathy From All Quarters for Consolation

After Xian Shi Company went on strike yesterday morning, all male and female employees gathered in the commercial center to discuss negotiation methods. Upon hearing this unfortunate news, colleagues from Yong An, Da Xin, Xin Xin, and other companies were very sympathetic and sent representatives to bring food for consolation. At [time] in the afternoon, the Industry Section of the Public Works Department tried to mediate. The company manager also arrived at the time, but negotiations between the two sides still yielded no results.

Xian Shi Authorities Express Attitude

It is also learned that Xian Shi Company authorities replied to the Industry Section of the Public Works Department, represented by Mr. Gu, who went to convene labor-management mediation, as follows: (1) Monthly work compensation [days] days are currently only given by our company. No other company has this, so it is difficult to give an additional three days. In the future, it can only be implemented if all companies in the industry agree. (2) The rice allowance can be guaranteed, but the amount and method must await a reply from the headquarters. (3) Bonuses must be based on the company's established methods. (4) Employees should not be dismissed without reason. The company has never implemented this. The above four items are the personal opinions of the Shanghai branch manager. The exact situation is still subject to the Hong Kong headquarters' reply and handling.

Conditions Proposed by Da Xin Employees

Da Xin Company on [street name] Road was the first to go on strike to request an increase in salaries. More than 600 employees of the company sent four representatives to the company authorities on the morning of the ninth to propose four improved treatment conditions. By noon on the tenth, the management had not yet resolved the matter satisfactorily, which led to a short strike starting at 1:30 PM on the afternoon of the tenth. After much mediation, work resumed at 4:30 PM that afternoon. At that time, the employees' demands included: (1) Salary increase: trainees will receive an additional five yuan, employees with salaries up to twenty-five yuan will receive an additional eight yuan, those below thirty-five yuan will receive an additional ten yuan, and those above thirty-five yuan will receive an additional 10%. Allowances will not be cancelled after the salary increase. (2) According to salary calculation, each yuan should be allocated a bonus of 3.5 jiao, to be settled at the end of the year. (3) Each person will be given a work compensation fee of five days per month. (4) Employees should not be dismissed without reason, and employee life should be guaranteed.

Da Xin Strike Fully Resolved

After the company's employees implemented the strike the day before yesterday afternoon, they sent representatives to visit Supervisor Cai Chang of the company again at 8 PM on the tenth, earnestly requesting that he consider the year-round hard work of the colleagues, who have always been diligent in their duties. The colleagues' request to improve their treatment is entirely due to environmental pressure, and the colleagues have no further demands. They only ask that they can live without excessive panic in this era of expensive goods, which is enough. Negotiations continued until 12 PM. Supervisor Cai then accepted all four demands made by the employees, namely: (1) Regarding the salary increase issue, it was approved to take effect from this month. (2) Bonuses will also be implemented from the end of the old lunar year of this year. However, it is not limited to a deduction of 3.5 cents per yuan per month, but rather the entire monthly salary will be calculated, with at least two months' salary being added for each person. (3) Restoring work compensation. The authorities believe that this principle is acceptable, but it must be jointly discussed by other companies. Da Xin cannot agree to it alone. (4) Job security is absolutely guaranteed. The representatives considered it satisfactory and immediately summoned all colleagues to report the negotiations with Supervisor Cai. The colleagues also believed that the negotiations were satisfactory and unanimously decided to resume business yesterday morning. The colleagues' association then issued a notice, encouraging all colleagues to do their best in their respective positions and work diligently, in order to live up to the high expectations of the authorities and to conform to the spirit of sincere unity between labor and management, in order to overcome the difficulties of this extraordinary period. As a result, the sky cleared and the clouds dispersed, which is a great blessing amidst misfortune.

### Shandong Guild Telegraphed Condolences to the Wu Family

The Shandong Guild telegraphed condolences to the family of General Wu Peifu, saying, "To the Family of General Wu in Beiping. We previously read in the newspapers that the General suddenly returned to the Taoist mountain due to a tooth ailment. The shocking news was widely reported, and we deeply mourn his passing. We specially send this telegram to express our condolences. We hope that you will restrain your grief and accept the change, so as to assist in major affairs. Respectfully, all members of the Shandong Guild in Shanghai."

### Goods on Da Xin Ship Entirely Sunk, Insurance Company to Investigate and then Proceed with Compensation Procedures

The British Da Xin ship left Wenzhou on the fourth of this month to come to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, when it arrived near Huanghua Pass outside the port of Wenzhou, it suddenly encountered a wind and hit a reef. Fortunately, nearby sailing ships did their best to rescue the crew, and all crew members were rescued. However, all of the goods loaded on board, mostly heavy items, could not be transported and were entirely sunk. The agent of the ship, the American firm Hua Shi Zai Xing, received a telegram the day before yesterday and contacted the insurance company that insured the ship. It is reported that the insurance company has decided to send a ship to investigate and then proceed with compensation.

### Relieving Refugees, Distributing Ginger Tea

Yesterday, Mr. Shen Youyu submitted a letter to this newspaper, saying, "It is reported that the weather has been extremely cold recently, and nearly a hundred refugees have frozen to death. Who can bear to witness this? The severe winter has just begun, and there are many more cold waves. Those homeless people on the streets are like sparrows waiting to die on branches. Although refugees and displaced people have become a societal problem, it is still an urgent matter for philanthropists to treat the symptoms. I have found that ginger tea has the function of warding off the cold. When life is barely clinging on against the wind, it may be possible to survive with its help. I believe there are many people of great compassion in Shanghai. If powerful people can set up stoves to distribute ginger tea in a few locations in the concession boundary, so that the fires of the stoves remain red and the ginger tea remains warm, it may be a way to save lives."

### Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Issued a Letter to All Merchants and Citizens, Sharing the Responsibility of Stabilizing Prices, Do Not Hoard or Monopolize, Lest You Risk the Consequences of the Law

Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a letter to all merchants and citizens, saying, "For several months, prices have risen sharply and the people's livelihood has been extremely difficult. White rice has reached as high as forty-five yuan per stone, and fuel has also continued to rise. Rice and coal are essential daily necessities, and life depends on them. One cannot be without them even for a day. The income of employees can barely cover these two expenses, and they already feel exhausted. In addition, rent, clothing, and daily necessities are all expensive, and nothing can be saved. They tell each other with furrowed brows, look up at the sky and sigh, and tremble at the thought of the future. Now, the Public Works Department has imposed a maximum price limit on rice, and the raging fire has been temporarily contained. However, stabilizing the market and maintaining public security requires the joint efforts of all sectors of society to be effective. Therefore, we earnestly advise that all industries should, from now on, share the heart of mutual assistance and common responsibility for stabilizing prices. Do not hoard or manipulate the goods you deal in. You must know that for the past two years, merchants and citizens have endured hardship in this extraordinary period, struggling to overcome difficulties and working hard in their respective positions. This sentiment and this aspiration are deeply understood by this association. Now that the difficulties are increasing, how can we bear to address only the symptoms without addressing the root cause, so as to damage our own reputation and risk the consequences of the law? Maintaining social order is the responsibility of all citizens. Please cherish yourselves and do not disappoint our hopes."

### Financial Situation of the Public Works Department, The Estimated Deficit After Offsetting Revenue and Expenditure for This Year is More Than 6.08 Million Yuan

The Director of Finance of the Public Works Department recently submitted a report to the Board of Directors of the Bureau, containing the Bureau's final accounts of revenue and expenditure as of the end of September of this year, and an overview of the estimated recurrent revenue and expenditure for this year. It is stated that after offsetting revenue and expenditure for this year, the estimated deficit is 6,052,160.61 yuan in national currency. In addition, the deficit in educational funds is 30,150 yuan, totaling 6,082,310.62 yuan, which is 3,758,530.61 yuan more than the deficit stated in the budget. It is found that ordinary expenditures increased by 5,366,442.46 yuan compared with the budget, and education expenses increased by 342,485.37 yuan compared with the budget, totaling 5,708,927.83 yuan. Various revenues increased by 1,950,397.12 yuan compared with the budget, with the difference being 3,758,530.61 yuan. The details are as follows:

Recurrent Revenue

(Ordinary Category) The various revenues in this category increased by 1,934,307.26 yuan compared with the budget. House tax inside and outside the boundary increased by 590,619.91 yuan and 110,767.48 yuan respectively compared with the budget. The important reasons for this are three: (1) The number of residents in the East District is gradually increasing. (2) Factories in the West District are developing. (3) The construction of new residences. In addition, pier fees, license fees, and revenue from public municipal undertakings increased by 153,996.46 yuan, 349,814.38 yuan, and 649,570.16 yuan respectively.

Recurrent Expenditure

(Ordinary Category) The various expenditures in this category exceeded the budget by 5,366,442.46 yuan. Among them, the main items are ordinary expenditures (including expenditures not belonging to various departments, such as pensions and other retirement benefits, subsidies, and refunded taxes and house rents), which increased by 2,374,308.40 yuan. The Police Department increased by 1,016,026.56 yuan, prisons and reformatories increased by 295,541.92 yuan, the Public Works Department increased by 551,912.08 yuan, and the purchase cost of storage funds in various departments increased by 724,605.83 yuan. The tightening of exchange rates this year is the main reason for the increase in various expenditures in this category.

Police Expenditure

(Ordinary) The expenditures in this category exceeded the budget by 1,016,026.56 yuan. Among them, salaries accounted for 517,641.98 yuan, and other expenditures accounted for 498,384.58 yuan. The salary item includes temporary living allowances of 388,159.01 yuan, exchange rate allowances of 37. 个73.62 yuan, and long-holiday exchange rate allowances of 68,046.08 yuan. Due to the increase in treatment for Japanese police officers, the total basic salary increased by 60,117.67 yuan. Other expenditures include fuel costs of 157,779.39 yuan, vehicle and horse expenses of 96,489.11 yuan, uniform and equipment costs of 67,910.01 yuan, medical expenses of 41,834.47 yuan, electricity bills of 56.70 yuan.30 yuan, water bills of 15,606.42 yuan, printing and stationery expenses of 18,747.62 yuan, and maintenance and repair costs of 31,615.98 yuan, etc. The increase in these expenses is due to the tightening of exchange rates and the soaring cost of labor and materials. Among the increased expenditures for prisons and reformatories, prisoners' food accounted for 219,329.41 yuan. The reasons for this are the skyrocketing prices and the increase in the number of prisoners.

Public Works Expenditure

(Ordinary) The expenditures increased by 551,921.08 yuan. Among them, 263,055.63 yuan was for garbage management. The reason for such a large increase in this expenditure is that the amount of garbage is increasing greatly every day, and the Bureau must pay subsidies to the competent authorities of the garbage dump sites outside the boundary every month. The Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Huxi Electric Power Company were approved to collect surcharges, and the Bureau's burden exceeded the budget by 106,568.78 yuan.

Purchase of Storage Items

Expenditures in this category exceeded the budget by 724,605.83 yuan. The expenses for road-building materials and other supplies required by the Public Works Department, and the various expenses for uniforms made by the Police Department accounted for the majority of this. The reasons are nothing more than the tightening of exchange rates and the soaring prices of goods.

Education Expenses

The educational expenses provided from the recurrent revenue are 2,592,835.41 yuan. This number is the maximum amount that can be provided from the property tax according to the current education policy. The estimated deficit is still 30,150 yuan.

### The Hongqiao Sanatorium in Western Shanghai is Occupied by the Japanese Army, Wooden Houses are Being Built Next to the Hospital with Unknown Uses, The Plan to Relocate the Russian Hospital is Cancelled

The Hongqiao Sanatorium at 310 Hongqiao Road in Western Shanghai occupies a large area and has magnificent architecture. It has been empty since the "August 13th" incident, with the Italian flag hanging outside for more than two years. Recently, it was suddenly occupied by the Japanese army, and many wooden houses were built on the open space east of the hospital and west of Fales Road. The graves in the area have been levelled, and the area has been fenced off with wire mesh. Many believe that these wooden houses will be used as storage places for military equipment or parking for vehicles. As for what purpose the Japanese army will use the building, there are various theories. Some say it will be used as a Japanese military hospital, while others say it will be used as a dormitory for the puppet police. The truth is still unclear. It is also unknown whether the Japanese army leased or bought the building from the owner, or even occupied it by force. However, according to what we have heard, the Russian Orthodox Church in Shanghai originally had two hospitals, one on Shanzhong Road and the other on Zhao Zhujiao Road. The latter is a mental hospital. Because the address is too small and the equipment is insufficient, it was planned to borrow the Hongqiao Road Sanatorium and relocate there. It was being discussed, but the Japanese army occupied the sanatorium, so the plan of the Orthodox Church was completely obstructed and did not come to fruition.

### French Concession News: River Gate Opened Yesterday; New North Gate to Open in Five Days; New North Gate Entrance and Xin Kai River Exit for Future Population

There was much talk about the French Concession opening the iron gate on Rue de la République linking to the southern part of the city, but it was repeatedly delayed due to security concerns. However, the French Concession Municipal Council, considering the inconvenience to residents entering and exiting the southern city via a detour through Paitung, decided to show consideration and planned to open the Xin Kai River iron gate on the 10th of this month. However, due to procedural and preparatory issues, the opening was changed to

Trial Opening

Yesterday. This news was first reported by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, Kong Chou. The Xin Kai River iron gate officially opened at 5 AM yesterday under the supervision of French, Russian, and Vietnamese police. Those entering or exiting the area no longer need permits issued by the French Concession. Those entering the southern city from the Concession only need to hold a white "Resident Certificate" from the southern city. To understand the situation, the reporter

Went to Investigate

Yesterday. Along the Xin Kai River area of the Bund in the French Concession, the number of people entering and exiting the southern city with the elderly and children was extremely crowded. To maintain order, the French Concession stationed Chinese detectives at the entrance of Xin Kai River to direct traffic. Those entering the southern city or leaving the Concession walked on the left-hand sidewalk, while the center was a thoroughfare for cars. The reporter saw Japanese naval personnel entering and exiting the Concession, all using

This Road.

The Southern City Resident Certificate Inspection Point is located in front of the Jiangsu Farmers' Bank and the Sheng Sheng Ranch Southern City Office on Rue de la République, Xin Kai River. The inspection procedures are carried out by Japanese military police. Citizens entering and exiting must remove their hats but do not bow. To avoid pedestrian congestion, a sign at the entrance reads "Walk on the Left." Generally, citizens now know that Xin Kai River is passable, and all flock to this gate to enter and exit, leading to

Ferry Sampans

Experiencing a sharp decline in business and crying out in distress. According to Western newspapers, rents in the area of Old North Gate, Fuyou Road, and the Nine Mu Land in the southern city have already increased several times. There are even cases where people are willing to pay an extra fee but still cannot find a place to live. The French Concession authorities are conducting a trial opening for five days this time to see how it goes and then decide whether to continue. Another piece of news received by the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter is that the New North Gate iron gate may also be opened soon. The opening date is approximately five days later, and it has been decided that the New North Gate iron gate will be the entrance, while Xin Kai River will be changed to the exit.

### Japanese Forcefully Enclose Civilian Land in Zhabei to Build Vegetable Market

To control the supply of vegetables and food in the city, the Japanese recently forcefully enclosed over 30 mu of civilian land behind the Four Banks Warehouse and the Continental Bank Warehouse at the eastern end of Guangfu Road in Zhabei, bordering North Xizang Road to the west and Manchuria Road. Construction is currently underway, and it is expected to be completed within the year, with business operations starting next spring.

### Over 400 Bicycles Seized for Transporting Rice

Since the Japanese took control of grain in Shanghai, the supply has become scarce and prices have soared. Recently, all rice transport licenses for various forwarding companies have been revoked, making it impossible to transport rice to the concessions. Unscrupulous hoarders are taking the opportunity to raise prices limitlessly. However, inland rice merchants are unable to find buyers, causing the market to stagnate. Seeing the potential for profit, villagers are using bicycles to transport rice from the Zongshan Road in west Shanghai, through Zhabei, to Hongkou and the Eight Concessions, earning over ten yuan per day. Therefore, in recent days, these rice vendors have been constantly coming and going. Now, they have been suddenly banned by the Japanese military stationed in the Lin Ken Road, west Shanghai, and both the bicycles and the rice have been confiscated. It is said that over 400 bicycles have been seized in the past two days.

### French Police Seize 150,000 Copper Coins; Public Believes Smuggling Merchants Can Be Investigated

At around 10 AM yesterday, French police officers discovered a large amount of copper auxiliary coins hidden in a car while searching pedestrians on Songshan Road. Suspecting that they were smuggling copper coins, they took them to the police station together. Upon inspection, the number of copper coins reached as many as 150,000. Strict interrogation is currently underway. It is found that these copper auxiliary coins have recently disappeared, mostly hoarded by unscrupulous merchants for sale at high prices, which has greatly affected the financial situation. After the news of the seizure was revealed, all sectors applauded, because it can enable the authorities to investigate the unscrupulous merchants who manipulated the purchase.

### Housing Dispute in Qing Yu Li: Mediation Fails; Retrial Opens for Debate Yesterday

The contract between the Shanghai Women's Bank, the contractor of the Qing Yu Li houses on Chongqing Road, and the Poor Children's Education Institute, the owner, stipulated that the houses in the neighborhood must be renovated by January 1, 1939; otherwise, the Women's Bank would forfeit the deposit of 59,000 yuan and compensate for a loss of 150,000 yuan. Therefore, based on the contract, the Women's Bank filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court last year, ordering more than 3,000 tenants in over 60 households in the neighborhood to move out. As a result, after

Three Trials,

The tenants were all defeated. Up until the date of forced execution, the tenants, due to the extraordinary period and the over-demand for housing in Shanghai, were unable to move, leading to repeated disputes. Recently, the tenants discovered that before the conclusion of the second instance debate, the Women's Bank had reached a settlement with the Poor Children's Education Institute, with the Poor Children's Education Institute agreeing to extend the deadline for three years and reduce the rent. Therefore, Yuan Yang'an, Su Jingqi, and Yu Chengxiu, lawyers, filed

A Retrial

With the Second Branch of the High Court. The High Court approved it and held a hearing once. The court ordered mediation. Yesterday, the case was heard by Han Zuzhi, Chief Judge of the Civil Division of the Second Branch of the High Court, along with judges Shen Hong and Zhang Qinglan. First, lawyer Yuan stated that during the extension period, the plaintiffs in the retrial, represented by his firm, sent a letter to the Women's Bank proposing a settlement method: (1) extending the lease period, (2) the tenants agreeing to moderately increase the rent, and (3) the losses suffered by both parties due to the litigation should be verified and mutually

Compensated.

He stated that this was extremely fair, but the Women's Bank had no intention of settling the matter, and that their agent had discussed it with Manager Yao of the bank but received no reply. The lawyer representing the Women's Bank stated that regarding the settlement, the Women's Bank requested evidence to clarify the issue of the tenants' representation because there were still problems with it, but they did not receive a reply, so there was no room for negotiation. The court immediately asked that since the tenants had proposed a settlement method, the Women's Bank should also have a method to

Negotiate

And reach a settlement. However, the lawyer stated that it was difficult to negotiate the method proposed by the tenants, so it was obviously difficult to reach a settlement. The court then questioned both parties in detail on the facts and the law and ordered the debate to begin. First, lawyer Yuan Yang'an argued that the reason for the Women's Bank's lawsuit was the contract signed with the Poor Children's Education Institute, which stated that if the house was not renovated by January 1, 1939, the Women's Bank would suffer a loss of more than 200,000 yuan. Now that the contract has been

Extended for Three Years,

The Women's Bank is no longer at risk of suffering a loss. Moreover, in the current extraordinary circumstances, the demand for housing exceeds the supply, and it is difficult to find a house. It is not the tenants' intention to deliberately make things difficult and refuse to move. Now that there is evidence of this new fact, the tenants have filed this lawsuit, requesting the court to overturn the original judgment based on the evidence and order the Women's Bank to bear all litigation costs. Lawyer Yu then further explained the evidence obtained. Lawyer Su was about to argue, but the court declared the debate suspended because it was past noon, and scheduled the debate to continue at a later date.

### Antique Tycoon Miao Xihua Accused of Embezzling Family Property; Defendant Absent, Hearing Adjourned

Miao Xihua, a wealthy Ningbo merchant in Shanghai, has been buying antiques in the Beijing-Shanghai area for many years. Through skillful operations, he has accumulated over one million yuan and owns many properties in Shanghai. Recently, his nephews, Miao Zhonghao and Miao Yinghao, filed a complaint through lawyers Zhang Shouchun and Hu Yongde in the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, accusing him of embezzling family property. The complaint stated that the plaintiffs' late father, Mr. Xi Rong, had

Three Brothers.

The eldest brother, Xi Fan, currently resides in Ningbo. The plaintiffs' father was the second brother. The third uncle, Xi Hua, is the defendant in this case. The family's total property is estimated at 1.5 million yuan. The family's wealth began when the plaintiffs' father, Xi Rong, invested 40,000 yuan in the first year of the Republic of China and handed it over to the defendant, his third uncle, to jointly purchase antiques and treasures from the former Qing Palace in Beijing. Within a few months, they made a profit of over one million yuan. Later, they continued to purchase, earning tens of thousands of yuan within a few years. At that time, the plaintiffs' father was doing business in his hometown, while the defendant was

Trading Antiques

In Beijing. Due to the distance and brotherly affection, he did not suspect anything. Later, the defendant returned to his hometown once, and the plaintiffs' father settled accounts with him. Unexpectedly, the defendant embezzled the 40,000 yuan investment and 500,000 yuan in profits, which can be testified to by direct relatives and close relatives. Later, in 1934, the plaintiffs' mother went to the defendant's house to negotiate for a division of property. Unexpectedly, the defendant became angry and assaulted her, leading to a criminal prosecution. However, after repeated mediation by relatives and friends, the criminal case was settled with a 4,000 yuan

Severance

Relationship. At that time, the plaintiffs and their mother were forced to settle the case due to economic pressure. The criminal case was exchanged for a completely unrelated severance relationship as a condition for settling the matter, which clearly shows his embezzlement of family property and bullying of widows and orphans. This kind of forced written evidence is not only invalid according to law, but also sufficient to prove his embezzlement of family property. Therefore, it is undoubtedly a violation of Article 335 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, the lawsuit was filed to summon the defendant to court and punish him with

Due Punishment.

And a civil suit was attached, ordering the defendant to return the 40,000 yuan investment and 500,000 yuan in family property. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce presided over the hearing in the Fourth Criminal Court. The defendant did not appear. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Zhang Shouchun, who stated the above situation. Since the defendant did not appear, he requested an arrest warrant. The court adjourned the hearing to a later date.

### Transportation Company Director Arrested for Embezzlement

Zhang Difan founded the Haida Long Transportation Company at No. 7, Lane 158, Yunnan Road, and hired Sun Jiaxiang, a native of Ningbo, as the business director. At that time, it was agreed that if the business developed in the future, the profits would be split 40/60. However, from August 1st of this year to the 16th of last month, the company suddenly announced a temporary suspension of business before the fourth month of operation. After Zhang Difan audited the accounts, he discovered that Sun Jiaxiang had embezzled more than 1,000 yuan. He immediately reported to the Lao Zha Police Station and requested an investigation. It was not until 6 AM the day before yesterday that Chinese detective Chen Ruisheng arrested Sun Jiaxiang in Room 453 of the East Asia Hotel on Nanjing Road and took him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court's First Criminal Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that the defendant had embezzled more than 4,000 yuan, which had not yet been fully investigated, and requested permission for detention. Sun Jiaxiang hired lawyer Liu Suxia to defend him in court. Judge Feng ordered Sun to be detained for seven days for further interrogation.

### Robber Armed with Damaged Handgun Captured by Brave Victim

Wang Yujiu (36 years old), a native of Yancheng, has recently been gambling heavily in west Shanghai and is unable to make a living. At 7:30 PM the day before yesterday, he colluded with a fugitive named Tian Hu and gave him a damaged handgun without bullets to rob pedestrians near the intersection of East Broadway Road and Hua Ji Road. After a while, Shui Chongjiu (44 years old), a native of Ningbo, wearing an overcoat, staggered over. Wang Yujiu stepped forward and stopped him, took out the handgun, told him to be quiet, and ordered him to take off the overcoat. Shui Chongjiu was quite brave and took the opportunity to punch the right hand of the robber holding the gun. The handgun fell to the ground. Shui Chongjiu was about to arrest him, but Wang fled. As a result, Wang was captured with the help of a passerby, Mao Acai, along with the handgun without bullets, and handed over to the patrolling Chinese police, who took him to the Huishan Police Station. The head of the police station ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case and said that the accomplice who was at large could not be arrested and requested an extension. After questioning Wang, Judge Huang Risheng ordered him to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing for seven days.

### Shen Quanyu Extortion Case: Hearing Continues Yesterday; Defendants Deny Charges

On the 18th of last month, the French police, based on a report from Shen Quanyu (nicknamed "Xiao Diao Li"), a local resident of No. 10, Ren He Li, Hongqiao Road, said that his fellow villagers, Qin Haixiang and Shen Huixin, had extorted 500 yuan from him and agreed to pay the money at the Xu Jia Hui Yi Le Tian Tan Huang Yard at about 5 PM that afternoon. After receiving the report, the head of the police station sent detectives in disguise and arrested Qin and Shen on the spot. The next day, the mediator, Qu Zengyuan, was also arrested. All three were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday, the hearing continued. First, the plaintiff, Shen Quanyu, appeared in court and testified that Qin and others came to his home and threatened his mother, saying that if he did not pay the money to settle the matter, they would take drastic measures against him. Therefore, he asked his uncle-in-law, the third defendant, Qu Zengyuan, to mediate with Qin and others. When questioned, the defendant Qin Haixiang testified that the plaintiff, Shen Quanyu, had been acting as an informant in a certain area. Because he had served as an officer in the National Army, he was reported to a certain area by Shen at Xinzhuang Town in West Shanghai last summer and was arrested. Fortunately, his family found a way to release him, but in the meantime, he had spent more than 1,000 yuan. Therefore, this time he came to Shanghai to ask him to compensate for the loss. The third defendant, Qu Zengyuan, testified that the plaintiff was his nephew and that his mother had asked him to mediate because he had a feud with Qin and others. He did not know anything else and hired lawyer Shen Zongyong to defend him and requested bail. After reviewing the statements, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date and ordered the defendants to be returned to custody.

### Two Women Fight Over a Girl: Biological Mother Wants to Take Her Back

Sun Wangshi, a local woman living in Xiaotaoyuan, Xujiahui, West Shanghai, gave birth to a girl nine years ago. After raising her for six months, she planned to send her to the Sacred Mother's Convent of the Catholic Church. Later, through an introduction, she was adopted by Huang Heshi (48 years old this year), a woman from Taizhou who was a fresh egg vendor at No. 4, Dyeing Mill Lane, Xujiahui, as her adoptive daughter and named Shuying, who is now ten years old. This matter has been going on for nine and a half years. Six years ago, the girl's biological mother, Sun Wangshi, suddenly reported to the police station that her grandson was missing and then suddenly requested the case to be closed after finding him. Until recently, Sun Wangshi suddenly asked Huang Heshi to take the girl back for upbringing. After Heshi refused, the two sides clashed and quarreled, and both reported to the French police, requesting an investigation. After the head of the police station sent detectives to investigate, he summoned both parties and the girl to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday afternoon, and the police lawyer filed a lawsuit according to law. According to Sun Wangshi, she initially fostered the girl with Shi and now wants to take her back. According to Huang Heshi, she adopted the girl through an introduction, paid ten yuan for breastfeeding fees, and has witnesses to testify to this. She also brought the witness to court. After a detailed interrogation by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, he ruled in court that the girl, Huang Shuying, should be allowed to be taken back by Huang Heshi. If Sun Wangshi wants to take the girl back, she should file a confirmation lawsuit with the Civil Court of this court.

### Trolley Hits Rickshaw Puller; Driver Faints from Fright

At 10:30 AM yesterday, a No. 188 Route 14 trolleybus ran over a rickshaw puller on Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road, injuring him. The driver was probably overly frightened and drove the bus onto the sidewalk at the intersection of Seymour Road and Weihaiwei Road. At the same time, the driver fainted in his seat and lost consciousness. Later, an ambulance was called to take the driver to the hospital for treatment.

Gambling Den "Supervision Department" Orders: Japanese Forbidden from Entering Gambling Dens. All Gambling Dens Posted the Order Yesterday. "Transactions" with Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese Prohibited. Violators Will Have Gambling Den Licenses Revoked

According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, the "Entertainment Venue Supervision Department" in charge of the gambling dens in West Shanghai issued an order yesterday (the 10th) stating that from now on, Japanese, Koreans, and Taiwanese are not allowed to gamble in the gambling dens. Any gambling den that "transacts" with such people will have its license revoked immediately. All gambling dens in West Shanghai have posted this order. Some gambling dens have written the order in large characters on red paper and pasted it on the door. It is believed that the "Supervision Department" issued this order as a direct result of the Zhao Feng General Assembly shooting incident on November 26th. On that day, three Japanese special agents entered the Zhao Feng General Assembly and lost three or four thousand gold, which led to a conflict with the gambling den operators. They pulled out guns and opened fire. Immediately, the Japanese military police arrived at the scene and took the three Japanese away. The Zhao Feng General Assembly was temporarily closed, and the license was returned on Saturday and Sunday. The license fee for the Zhao Feng General Assembly has been increased from 150 yuan to 300 yuan per day.

### Writing Under the Lamp

— Qin Lao

One

Although the Danish philosopher Kierkegaard is famous as a mystic, he always used sharp language to criticize the society before him thoroughly. I saw the following passage in the German "Kierkegaard Aphorism Collection" ("So Spricht Soren Kierkegaard") compiled by R. Dolinger:

The so-called era, as a whole, is revolutionary, completely wanting to start from the beginning and abandon tradition... But look, in daily life, in actual life, the people who form the current era all regard calling for the rescue of tradition as the highest ideal, and this ideal is extremely difficult to abandon. For example, merchants post advertisements in newspapers every day, hoping to gain the traditional power that cannot be obtained without decades from repeated events.

This situation is everywhere. Yes! It can be said that our era's commerce and trade actually follow tradition through ingenious methods.

Thus, what people think is this: to leave that kind of ancient tradition that is already useless, and hope to establish as quickly as possible a tradition that serves as a substitute, that is, a tradition that is put into practice through ingenious methods.

People think they are revolutionary and hate everything called tradition. - But collectivism pushes a kind of tradition to the masses in the shortest possible time, precisely to show revolution. - Note how convenient this tradition is for this so-called benefactor of mankind!

This saying seems a little obscure, but it is really very profound. This phenomenon is everywhere before our eyes, and there is no need to cite examples. According to Kierkegaard, everything that maintains tradition through ingenious methods is the behavior of merchants. But truly speaking, this meaning is not excessive. Let's look at the gentlemen who are currently using many ingenious explanations to get young people to read "Classical Chinese". Is it actually for the sake of business?

In the same book, there is another passage:

In what was written by the Jewish swindler Didler, I read the story of the robber from Berlin that was very widespread - that is, one of the Ribendahl family. He was Jewish and was originally a pickpocket, but because he was not doing very well, he made a great oath to God under the fair "Heavenly Realm" (for the Jews, the so-called "Heavenly Realm" is of particular significance, at least Didler said so), saying: He would never do pickpocketing again no matter what. He kept his covenant - but in an instant he went to be a robber. When he came out of prison again, he prayed to God again, vowing never to be a robber again. - But this time he went to be a swindler.

Although this is said of the Jews, it has nothing to do with our current fashionable "anti-Semitism". The focus is only on explaining this kind of stereotype. But I don't know if it's because I'm nervous, but I always feel like this is operating on the bodies of some of our constantly changing celebrities and writers.

### Language Small Stories

— Zhu Yu

Words in Heaven

Adam learned to speak in Heaven, but what language did he learn? This is a big question, and one that has tormented many "scholars."

St. Jerome said: "All documents prove that Hebrew, in which the Old Testament was written, is the earliest language of mankind." If that were the case, there wouldn't be much to say; but later, as various national languages arose, everyone wanted to trace their own language back to Heaven, and disagreements emerged.

Goropius said Dutch was the language of Heaven. Kempe disagreed, saying that in Heaven, God spoke Swedish to Adam, and Adam replied in Danish, while the hateful serpent spoke French to Eve. Erro, in his great work "The Primitive World," said Basque was the language of Adam. Eastern Christians have a different view. According to the "opinion" of the Persians, Adam and Eve spoke Persian, the Archangel spoke Turkish, and the serpent spoke Arabic.

The "pluralistic theory" has one drawback: with such disunity in the language of Heaven, conversations would probably be very difficult. However, in our judgment, the true meaning of "pluralism" is to promote the excellence of one's own language and despise foreign languages.

Each Has Its Specialty

The Chinese believe that Suzhou dialect is for women, Beijing dialect is for men, Ningbo dialect is for merchants, and Yangzhou dialect is for laborers, each with its own specialty. Foreigners also have their ideas: women speak Italian, men speak French, birds speak English, horses speak German, and God speaks Spanish. I would like to ask you all, can you use the English you have learned to talk to birds? If so, then Gongye Chang would not be able to spread his fame abroad.

The specialty of languages was particularly evident in ancient India, where women spoke Prakrit and privileged men spoke Sanskrit. Such language prohibitions are still prevalent among today's barbarians.

When the Caribs occupied the Small Antilles, they killed all the men, leaving only women for reproduction. As a result, the languages of men and women became completely different. Women understood the men's language, but never spoke it, and vice versa. Therefore, sons spoke the men's language, and daughters spoke the women's language. So, the phrase "my father" was Noukouchili when a woman said it, Voumaan when a man said it, and Baaba when they said it together. The Chiquitos also do this: men have three ways of saying "go home": Yebotu ti n-ipoostu (he goes to his home), Yebotu ti ipoos (he goes to her home), and Yebo ti n-ipoostu (she goes to his home); but women only have one way of saying it, which is Yeboti n-ipoos (she goes to her home). Among the Warramunga Aborigines of Australia, even widows are forced to use sign language.

Save the Women!

### Children of the Motherland

— Shu Xi

On the roadside, I met Qing, who told me some news; joy filled my heart, yes, I should see them off.

Stepping onto the stone steps, I walked into an artist's studio. They reached out their warm hands and shook mine tightly.

"Friends! Have you decided to leave?"

"Yes, we are going to throw ourselves into the embrace of the Motherland!" This powerful answer was filled with boundless excitement and determination. I gazed at their radiant faces; hanging on the wall were several bold and unrestrained oil paintings in the style of P. Cezanne and V. Gogh, light, heat, and power filled my surroundings, and I forgot that it was a cold dusk.

There were no rich people's delicacies, fine wine, and beautiful women, just a small square table, nine people sitting close together, a few plates of melon seeds, peanuts, cakes, biscuits, and a few cups of tea. This was the farewell banquet prepared by Teacher Yan for them, but in these refreshments, everyone tasted the supreme teacher-student warmth!

Teacher Wang was the oldest of them, and he said: "I am very happy about your departure! Yes, young people, if you don't contribute to the Motherland at this time, when will you wait! Speaking of which, I am also ashamed..." You have broken away from this cage, and you can breathe deeply the free and fresh air. There, everywhere is filled with a great and magnificent picture...

I couldn't say anything, I silently thought to myself, in the wandering life, long years have passed, and now I am trapped in this cage again, for life? But living in this dark gray shadow...

Teacher Yan earnestly exhorted them, encouraging them—this loving mother!

"Have you told your parents about your departure this time?" Teacher Wang asked Shao Fei with concern, a young man who had been married for a short time and had a wealthy family.

"I have told them; they all said, 'Child! You belong to the Motherland!'..."

Everyone's palms clapped loudly, counting as a glorious and exciting answer to him.

Due to time constraints, I had to leave first. On the way back, the sharp north wind was blowing, but enthusiasm still lingered in my heart. I silently recited Shelley's lines: "If winter comes, can spring be far behind!..." I bless them.

### In Memory of Ye Zi

— Zhi Jing

News came that Mr. Ye Zi passed away on October 5th in his hometown of Yiyang County, Hunan.

Mr. Ye Zi was very young, but his life was difficult and multifaceted. Regarding his experience, Mr. Lu Xun said, "It is worth a century of experience for peaceful people in a peaceful world." He saw, encountered, and heard many things, and he used a not-very-flexible pen to write about the yin and yang sides of the world, showing the arrogance, meanness, filth, and oppression of one world..., and the submissiveness, endurance, tragic fate, struggle, and resistance of another world...

Mr. Lu Xun edited the Slave Series, with his short story collection "Harvest" as the initial offering. These three hundred-plus pages are full of "fire-like enthusiasm, and a pile of blood and tears reality." In terms of technique, the author rationally admitted, "It lacks artistic elements too much," "For the grasp of characters, and the insertion of stories, often appear clumsy," "Some places are described too much, and described too little." However, the substantial content makes readers feel grief and indignation, and does not feel that there are major shortcomings; moreover, our author is still young, he "can humbly accept all well-intentioned criticism," he "can painstakingly, diligently and continuously learn," he wants to "maintain the original enthusiasm, strengthen the cultivation of technology and the experience of life" in the effort to contribute "decent things" (a modest expression), but now he has died with unfulfilled ambitions.

Indeed, he had planned to write a grand work reflecting the revolution of the motherland, "The Sun Rises from the West," and was buried in work in poverty and illness to make it appear, but Heaven did not grant him long life, and ruthlessly took away his life, which should be deeply regretted by us literary searchers.

Mr. Ye Zi's death left him destitute and in need of assistance. Colleagues in the literary and art circles in Hong Kong, Xia Yan, Li Bo, Yu Feng, Ai Wu, Yang Gang, Dai Wangshu, Xin Pi, and Xi Ru, launched a fundraising campaign to support his family. In Shanghai, there should be no shortage of Mr. Ye Zi's friends, in order to commemorate him and let this cultural warrior rest in peace, please extend your hands to fulfill some responsibility. (Fundraising to support the family of Mr. Ye Zi)

### By the Chuanchang River

— Yi Xiang

We spread enthusiasm by the Chuanchang River,

Let the scorching sun burn at noon,

The crystal clear river silently soothes the shadows of the willows,

Let the fiery heat melt away, we are soaked with sweat,

Fervent hearts strive for a truth,

"Should we let the shadows of life stain our hearts?"

We hate the meanness of life,

Grinding our teeth, we won't allow man to eat man!

Joy!

The power of the farmers leaps on the earth,

Children are stars, shining in all directions in the sky;

We sow the seeds of new life,

Listening to a string of living songs behind us.

We marvel at the poetic sunset by the Chuanchang River,

Watching the silver flow of the moon swaying in the heart of the Chuanchang River,

Our hearts fly to the innocence of ancient times,

The singing of the times resounds;

In the distance, the lights of Xichang twinkle.

Entertainment Circles

### A Pilgrimage to Dahua

— Le

The official opening of the Dahua Grand Theater today is a glorious chapter in the history of maritime entertainment this year. Dahua's predecessor was originally "Summer Pick," one of the first theaters to show sound films. For various reasons, it closed for many years. During this process, we passed by the entrance and couldn't help but sigh! Now, this quiet and desolate courtyard has been transformed into a magnificent palace of art, and it will attract thousands of movie fans in an active posture, which is indeed a gratifying and congratulatory thing.

On the eve of the opening, I made a special pilgrimage. Within half an hour, all the new equipment was in sight, and I deeply admired the greatness of the contributions of the designers. In terms of temperature, general theaters are often overheated in winter and too cold in summer, which has a negative impact on the human body. Dahua is equipped with a new type of air conditioner to control the cold and heat, extracting dirty air and delivering fresh and clean air; in terms of light, Dahua uses a newly invented "hole-free sky view" screen, so the light is bright and soft, and will not damage the audience's eyes; in terms of sound equipment, Dahua uses the new Wenzier "Ace" projector, which has no drawbacks of uneven light intensity or broken film interruptions; "sound, light, and seat" are all three beautiful, which is really rare.

I sincerely hope that the Dahua authorities can, in addition to this kind of excellent equipment, also match it with careful selection of films, thoughtful service, low prices, and acceptance of audience opinions...I believe the future is very promising.

### Saving the Orphan of Zhao (Part 2)

— Su Shaoqing

In his later years, when Tan Xinpei occasionally performed the role of Cheng Ying in this play, he always paired with Jia Honglin as Gongsun Chujiu and Huang Jianfu as Tu Anjia. The combination was seamless and popular. However, I have not heard of him performing the revenge scene. Based on the aforementioned singing by Wang Yutian, I know that Lao Tan must have performed it, and it was very famous at the time. It was probably before the Republic of China, at the end of the Guangxu era. Lao Tan formed his own Tongqing Troupe and performed it at Zhonghe Garden. Because Wang's singing fully imitated Tan's style, Wang would not have had this singing if Tan had not had this scene. (I have a recording of Wang singing this, and it has the most flavor of Tan's style.) In the Pi Huang troupes, the martial old men who perform Lu'an Zhou mostly do not include the broken arm storytelling of the Eight Great Hammers to return to the clan, while those who perform Wang Zuo's broken arm all include the viewing of paintings to return to the clan. Returning to the origin is very popular. Today, performing "Saving the Orphan of Zhao" without including the revenge scene is truly a regret. I advocate that this kind of excellent play can be arranged as a complete play, and even if it is not arranged as a complete play, it must include the viewing of paintings and revenge; otherwise, the audience will not know whether the orphan is alive or not, and whether the great revenge has been avenged or not. Old actors may have this complete script, or else seek it from the Beijing opera circles. If you can't find it, you can refer to historical sites and the Kunqu opera "Eight Heroes" to rewrite it. I feel that this kind of work is not difficult; the government is now promoting the Eight Virtues, and Cheng Ying and Gongsun's rescue of the orphan is a great virtue. The spirit of loyalty and righteousness, and the nature of perseverance, are rare in ancient times and are enough to encourage the present world. They only saved the life of one orphan, and were able to risk their lives and persevere without complaint. If we extend this, we can save society and save the country. Shouldn't we pursue and emulate this spirit of sacrificing life for righteousness and killing oneself for benevolence? Moreover, performing it as a drama, performing it as a popular Erhuang opera, would be deeply moving. Therefore, this kind of good play should be vigorously promoted, so I do not hesitate to spend my words and speak at length about it.

The tombs of Cheng Ying and Gongsun Chujiu are located in Zhao Village, Taiping County, Jiangzhou, Shanxi Province. They were found by officials of the Hedong Road in the Song Shenzong Dynasty, who were ordered to do so. Cheng Ying was posthumously named Marquis of Chengxin, and Gongsun Chujiu was posthumously named Marquis of Zhongzhi. A temple was ordered to be built in Jiangzhou, and sacrifices were made annually. The supervisor of the temple construction was the Jinshi Wu Chuhou. Because the imperial succession in the Shenzong Dynasty was repeatedly vacant, and Prince Yun was often ill, Chuhou submitted a memorial stating that the Zhao clan of this dynasty was actually a descendant of Zhao Wuzi of the Jin State (i.e., the Orphan of Zhao). If it were not for the rescue of Cheng Ying and Gongsun Chujiu at that time, the Zhao clan would have had no survivors, and there would be no foundation for the Song Dynasty today. Because the ancestors of Zhao Kuangyin, the founding emperor of the Song Dynasty, were all born in Hebei and were descendants of Zhao Wuling's father, Zhao Wu, the tenth generation grandson. Zhao Wu once wore mourning clothes for Cheng Ying for three years and built a shrine to worship him. Today, the shrine and tomb are no trace, and the sacrificial rites have been missing for a long time. The ghosts of the two have nowhere to return, and I am afraid that they are causing harm. It is appropriate to seek their tombs and temples, and add a special feudal title to repay their merits, so that loyalty and righteousness will be encouraged, and the succession will be prosperous. See Wu Chuhou's own "Qingxiang Miscellaneous Records." The tombs and temples of Cheng Ying and Chujiu were built because of Wu's request, and feudal titles were also granted. This matter is little known in society, so I hereby explain it.

### Guohua Film News

— Yixin

"Hero in a Chaotic World" is scheduled to start production within a day. The battle scenes are very grand. The actors have been taught by martial arts experts and have martial arts skills. Every punch, kick, knife, and spear has a solution, which is different from the random fighting of ordinary martial arts films. The prison break scene is extremely tense.

"Dong Xiaowan" is about to start filming immediately. The sets, costumes, and props have been carefully researched and cost more than 30,000 yuan. The lead actress, Zhou Xuan, is reading the script day and night.

The opening scene of "Li Amao and Miss Tang" has an airplane scene. At that time, the carpenters voted and needed 2,400 workers, occupying three-fifths of the entire studio.

The historical dramas produced by Guohua are very popular with overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Therefore, as soon as a film is made, orders come in one after another. Recently, in the Southeast Asian region, the status of Cantonese films has been taken over by Mandarin films.

Guan Dayuan Excels in Performing Old Plays such as Yong'an Palace and Hanyang Courtyard

From here onwards, it is about the Former Lord recovering in Yong'an Palace, not far from entrusting his son. The Former Lord dreamed of Guan Yu and Zhang Fei appearing as spirits, cried bitterly and woke up, and then there was a scene of crying at the spirit tablet, with two grand sections of tragic and desolate "Fan Xipi" added in the middle, recounting the three men's great defeat of the Yellow Turbans, the three battles with Lu Bu, and Guan Yu and Zhang Fei's martial strategies, etc. The tone was sad and could make listeners feel sorrowful. This is the characteristic of "Fan Xipi." It is a mistake for people to think that "Fan Xipi" started with Lao Tan. Later, the Former Lord's illness worsened, and Zhuge Liang came to Baidi City from Sichuan to accept the Former Lord's entrustment of his son. At that time, Ma Su was at his side, and his words offended the Former Lord, so he slapped Ma Su's face and said to Kongming, "Ma Su's words are exaggerated and ultimately useless." This is the origin of Kongming's line in "Empty City Stratagem," "...When the Late Emperor entrusted his son, he said..." However, the actor who plays Ma Su in the play is not a martial role, but a small clown, wearing a black headscarf, a green open robe, and small pendants, which is very different from the dress in "Empty City Stratagem." It is said that this play is the old script of Yu Sansheng, the grandfather of Shu Yan. Dayuan learned opera from the famous teacher Jia Lichuan (Jia Honglin's uncle) when he was young, and Lichuan's family had many old scripts, so Dayuan obtained this secret transmission.

(2) Hanyang Courtyard This play is also known as Crying for Liu Biao. The tune of crying is also Fan Xipi. This kind of tune is rare in the play. Some people say that this is the reverse tune of Erliu, and the interlude accompaniment is similar. The end of the Erliu sentence often goes to a high note, while the end of each sentence of Fan Xipi is low and slow, so the above statement is quite reasonable. However, what is puzzling is why this kind of tune is only used by Liu, the Former Lord, for crying "..." Crying "...". Is it because Liu Bei is an expert at crying, so he is specially allowed to enjoy the exclusive right? Not only is Dayuan good at performing the play Hanyang Courtyard, but he also taught it to Lian Liang, which shows that he is very humble and amiable, and not like those selfish people who hide good scripts and refuse to pass them on.
