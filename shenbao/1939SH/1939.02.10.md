### After Adjustment by Zhang Fakui, the Southern Battlefield's Chinese Army Lineup is Renewed; Yu Hanmou, Wu Qiwu, and Xia Wei are Separately Responsible for Various Military Routes; Beihai Appears Peaceful; the Western River's Grand Army to Launch Counteroffensive After the Spring Festival; Chinese Aircraft Conduct Raids for Days, Destroying Many Japanese Military Works in Guangzhou

(Hong Kong) The military situation on the Southern battlefield has been adjusted by Zhang Fakui, and coupled with guerrilla warfare, the lineup is renewed. According to military intelligence, the northern route is the responsibility of Yu Hanmou, whose mission is to lead the main frontal assault, with Zhang Duangui as the front-line commander. The eastern route is the responsibility of Wu Qiwu's forces, and the western route is the responsibility of Xia Wei's forces; their missions are all to provide flanking support, with Ou Zhen and Deng Longguang serving as commanders (Special dispatch, 8 PM on the 9th).

(Hong Kong) In the northern and western reaches of the Pearl River, Japanese troops have been causing disturbances with small numbers of remnant soldiers, lacking the strength for a major offensive. The Japanese navy is still gathered in Tokyo Bay, seemingly preparing to maneuver. It is learned that the Chinese western Pearl River grand army will launch a counteroffensive after the Spring Festival. The situation in Beihai is currently peaceful (Special dispatch, 9 PM on the 9th).

(Hong Kong) Chinese new air force planes have been dispatched for days to conduct bombing raids, destroying many Japanese military works in Guangzhou and along the Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Railway (Special dispatch, 9 PM on the 9th).

(Hong Kong) The Chinese air force has been launching daily air strikes on Guangzhou, dropping bombs in Shijing and Baiyun, and bombing Japanese ships between the province and Macau to hinder their resupply and transport. As a result, Japanese ships between the province and Macau have suspended operations (Special dispatch, 12 AM on the 9th).

(Guangzhou) According to sources from Dalong, 20 miles southwest of Guangzhou, Dalong has now become an important base for Chinese guerrilla forces near Guangzhou. These guerrilla forces, led by Li Fulin, are currently working hard to strengthen their resistance efforts to prevent Japanese forces from attacking Shunde and Chencun (Dispatch from the China United Press, 9th).

Sihui On the afternoon of the 8th, around 1 PM, Chinese troops crossed the river to attack Japanese troops, encountering them near Shigang and engaging in battle. Chinese troops in Mafang provided artillery support. The fierce fighting lasted until around 4 PM, when the Japanese troops retreated to Langang and Jitang. Chinese troops followed in pursuit. Unable to withstand the pressure, the Japanese troops fled towards Sanshui. In this battle, the Japanese suffered more than 30 casualties. Furthermore, this morning at 9 AM, Japanese troops in Makou bombarded Jinlida for an hour (Dispatch, 9th).

Guilin The Japanese flagship Izumo had already sailed back to Yokosuka yesterday. Furthermore, there are no traces of Japanese troops in San Shui Ge Wei. Some of the Japanese troops southwest of Sanshui moved towards Jiujiang the day before yesterday, constantly engaging in raids and looting, and intensifying the construction of fortifications in the Mafang area (Dispatch, 9th).

Guilin The Southwest war situation has appeared extremely quiet for the past week, but the Japanese side is actually still engaged in clandestine activities in all directions. According to observations by their military experts, the Japanese troops in Guangdong have recently devoted themselves especially to ensuring the safety of their main forces and maintaining transportation in the rear. Although the Japanese troops in Weizhou are determined to advance toward Beihai, the Japanese troops in the Dongjiang and Beijiang areas are putting on a show of force, busily constructing fortifications and consolidating strongholds. The Japanese troop movements on the western and southern routes of the Pearl River are very tense, and they definitely have aggressive intentions. The Japanese troops in various areas of eastern Hubei have recently been withdrawn from the front lines and reinforced, and two regiments of a certain division have been transferred to southern Hubei, with the aim of consolidating the outer strongholds of Wuhan. The Japanese troop movements in northern Jiangxi are frequent, with the aim of destroying the heroic and isolated Chinese army in Mount Lu in one fell swoop (Dispatch, 9th).

### Various Japanese Forces Suffer Losses; Overall Situation in Shanxi Now Safe; Japanese Troops from Outside the Pass Reinforce Separately; Japanese Transportation Vehicle Destroyed in Duancun

(Chongqing) The Japanese troops who attacked eastward in Huoxian were repelled. The Japanese troops who attacked southward in He Xian were blocked in Liangyu.

Yuanqu On the night of the 3rd, Chinese troops harassed the Japanese troops in Dongcheng Village and Weiguan Village (west of Qixian), encountering Japanese troops near Lianggou Village. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the pressure and retreated to defend the village. In this battle, more than 50 Japanese troops were killed (Dispatch, 9th).

Yuanqu At 10 AM on the morning of the 7th, 600-700 Japanese soldiers escorted grain and ammunition from Anyi to Zhangdian.

### Japanese Troops in Jingshan Hold Out, Awaiting Reinforcements

(Chongqing) The situation in central and northern Hubei is quiet. The Japanese troops are thinly stretched, only engaging in harassing raids with small units. The main forces are building fortifications and holding out in Yingcheng and Jingshan (Special dispatch, 9th).

Zhongxiang After more than ten days of fierce fighting in central Hubei, the war has now entered a stalemate. The Japanese troops launched an offensive west from Yingzao to Tianmen and Jingshan, with great momentum. They were met with brave attacks by the Chinese defending forces, resulting in more than 1,000 Japanese casualties. Their strength in the Yingzao area is approximately three regiments, which is barely enough to cope with the current war situation, and they are unable to launch further offensives. Currently, there are still more than 3,000 Japanese troops with eight cannons near Jingshan, constructing fortifications and holding out, awaiting reinforcements (Dispatch, 9th).

### The Pinghan Railway Is Destroyed Again

(Luoyang) On the night of the 5th, a certain unit of the Chinese army destroyed more than 100 meters of railway north of Xiaoji Town, cut more than 30 catties of electric wire, and took down more than 100 telegraph poles, disrupting traffic on the Pinghan Railway (Dispatch, 9th).

The Japanese troops retreated to Daquti. In this battle, more than 300 Japanese soldiers were killed, and three light and heavy machine guns, more than 40 rifles, and many military supplies were seized. Approximately ten Chinese soldiers were poisoned (Dispatch, 9th).

### Military Spokesperson Releases Weekly War Situation

(Chongqing) Regarding the war situation this week, the reporter recently met with the spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission, who made the following statement: The war situation on both the northern and southern fronts has become increasingly favorable to us this week. The most prominent aspects are as follows:

(1) The situation in Guangdong along the Yuehan and Guangzhou-Kowloon lines has not changed significantly. The Japanese troops entrenched in the old Sanshui, Langang, Xialegang, and Zaogang areas of Sanshui have been subjected to constant fierce attacks by our army in recent days, resulting in the annihilation of many Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese troops have been defeated and routed to Sanshui, and all these areas have been formally recovered by our army. Furthermore, the Japanese troops in Shengang also launched a joint infantry and artillery attack on the afternoon of one day, which was met with brave resistance and repeated hand-to-hand combat by our army, causing the Japanese troops to retreat completely. We are now taking advantage of the victory to encircle and attack the remaining Japanese troops in Shengang. On the southern route, approximately 30 Japanese warships are still patrolling the waters off Fangcheng, Qiongya, Xuwen, and Weizhou Island without taking any action. However, the Japanese have newly transferred two companies of chemical warfare troops from Taiwan to Guangdong, carrying 40 tons of poisonous gas, which will inevitably increase their barbaric nature and attempt to use poison to harm our officers and soldiers.

(2) After our army successively recovered Yuekou and Tianmen in central Hubei, more than 2,000 Japanese troops from Jingshan and Yingcheng launched another fierce attack on Tianmen towards Zaoshi. The Chinese army, taking advantage of its new victory and remaining strength, was extremely brave. After a fierce battle, the Japanese troops were completely defeated. The remaining Japanese troops in Jingshan are still under siege by our large army and have become sitting ducks. They are currently rushing to build fortifications in the suburbs, attempting to resist stubbornly. The Chinese and Japanese forces in southern and northern Hubei are still in a standoff, with no significant changes. It is judged that the Japanese troops intend to desperately maintain the consolidation of the outer perimeter of Wuhan, but it will be difficult for them to achieve their wishes under our army's encirclement and attack from all directions (To be continued).

### Large Numbers of Japanese Aircraft Bombard Everywhere; Pingliang, Guyuan, and Beihai Bombed; Chinese Aircraft Take Off from Lanzhou to Intercept

(Lanzhou) Twenty Japanese aircraft invaded Gansu via Shanxi and Shaanxi at around 10 AM on the 9th, and then split into two groups. One group of eleven aircraft flew to the skies over Pingliang at 10:20 AM and dropped bombs, while the other group of nine aircraft flew to Guyuan and dropped bombs outside the city. There was not much damage to the Chinese side. The city of Lanzhou issued an alert at 10:30 AM, and Chinese aircraft also took off to intercept them. The Japanese aircraft then regrouped and flew towards the northeast, so they did not encounter the Chinese aircraft. The alert here was not lifted until 11:30 AM (Dispatch, 9th).

Lian County From 7:30 AM to 4 PM on the morning of the 7th, more than ten Japanese aircraft constantly flew low and circled in Beihai. At around 10 AM, they dropped more than ten bombs next to Beihai, sinking several ships, destroying more than ten houses, and causing many deaths and injuries (Dispatch, 9th).

(Nanchang) Two Japanese aircraft invaded Nanchang at around 1 PM this afternoon, dropping 23 bombs in the Mozheng Street and Minde Road areas of the city. The China Light Daily and the Youth Association were destroyed. Furthermore, one Japanese aircraft was spotted spying in Dongxiang, Jinxian, Fengxin, and Jing'an counties from 10 AM to 12 PM on the morning of the 8th (Dispatch, 8th).

### Latest News

Last night, several parts of the French Concession heard very loud gunfire and artillery fire from the direction of the Nanshi area. The Beitang Road area of Xujiahui was especially clear. Upon inquiry to the French Concession police, it was said that this was probably the result of combat by guerrilla forces in the Nanshi area. However, the police had not yet received any information about this matter. As for the military police in the French Concession, they did not fire a single shot or shell last night. The gunfire and artillery fire last night began around 8:30 PM, and then occurred again every few minutes, with a very loud sound, suggesting that heavy artillery must have been used. The leading consul general of this port, the Italian consul general, announced yesterday that the Public Concession would hold elections for new board members of the Municipal Council on April 10th and 13th.

### Foreign Wire Report: Chongqing Officials Observe That Japan Eagerly Seeks Peace; China and Japan Cannot Negotiate Directly

Outcome of the War Depends on the Development of the European Situation; Future Peace Negotiations Must Be Mediated by the Great Powers

(Chongqing) Chinese officials here yesterday provided Reuters reporters with a brief overview of military, political, economic, and social matters relating to the National Government in the current situation. They also stated emphatically that China and Japan will definitely not engage in direct peace negotiations. Therefore, there must be a Far Eastern international conference, similar in nature to the Washington Conference, to mediate in order to resolve the current Sino-Japanese war. They believe that Japan is now eager to end the current war but will insist on victor's terms, which China will never accept. The terms proposed by China are also unacceptable to Japan. Therefore, it is expected that the Japanese army will launch another major offensive and then negotiate for peace in the hope of obtaining better terms. They also expect that the great powers in this peace conference will advocate maintaining China's territorial and administrative integrity, while at the same time urging China to respect Japan's treaty rights in China. The issue of suppressing communism will then become a point of contention. This complex event has not yet been properly resolved. Although there have been many reports of battles in western Shanxi, western Hubei, and eastern Guangdong in recent days, there has been no significant military development in general over the past few weeks. According to reliable Chinese sources, some Japanese troops are now quietly withdrawing from the Yangtze River basin, and it is also heard that Japanese troops are withdrawing from southern China. Chinese circles believe that the Japanese army will not launch new offensives in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, nor will they invade Guangxi from southern China. The current actions of the Japanese army in China seem to be aimed at seizing Zhengzhou and then attacking Tongguan west along the Longhai Railway in the hope of reaching Xi'an. Although this development has no significant military consequences, it is generally believed that all future Japanese military actions will be purely for the purpose of enhancing future political maneuvers. The nature of these maneuvers will be of the utmost concern to people here. Chinese circles also stated emphatically that the outcome of the current war largely depends on the future development of Europe. If war breaks out in Europe and Britain and France are victorious, then China will likely take the offensive and attempt to fight until victory. If Europe still maintains peace through consultation and mutual concession, then the great powers may exert international pressure on China and Japan to end the war through negotiations. The current international developments have destroyed the various theories of international trade. Although the London financial community strongly disagrees and still advocates free trade, China can currently only trade with foreign countries through barter because China can only exchange its products for weapons and ammunition. As for China's economic situation, it has not undergone significant changes due to the current war. The Chinese people have now limited their economic needs, which are easily met by local resources. The Sino-Japanese war has not caused major changes in Chinese society. The propertied and cultural classes still hold great power in the government, and farmers and workers are still the mainstay of the Chinese army. The Soviet Union has actively assisted China in this war, which has naturally increased the Soviet Union's prestige in China. However, the intellectual circles who rule China still firmly believe that if China hopes to achieve lasting peace and carry out the process of national revival, it must lean towards London and Washington (Reuters dispatch, 9th).

Editorial

### Talks from Chongqing

A Reuters dispatch from Chongqing stated that Chinese officials recently provided Reuters reporters with information regarding military, political, economic, and social matters. The contents of the talks are published in today's newspaper. Given the habits and methods of reporting and recording, I suspect that these so-called Chinese officials, by virtue of their qualifications and responsibilities, may not necessarily be speaking as spokespersons representing the Chinese Central Government. Therefore, regarding whether their statements accurately reflect the attitude of the Chinese government or whether they are precisely as the government intends to express, we have no way of definitively determining whether they are correct or not. Such officials' talks should naturally be viewed separately from the official expressions of the authorities. The content of the talks touches on many aspects, among which the following are worth commenting on: 1. China and Japan cannot engage in direct peace negotiations, so there must be a Far Eastern international conference to mediate in order to resolve the Sino-Japanese war; 2. "The issue of suppressing communism will become a point of contention. This complex event has not yet been properly resolved"; 3. The outcome of the current war largely depends on the future development of Europe. If war breaks out in Europe and Britain and France are victorious, then China will likely take the offensive and attempt to fight until victory. If Europe still maintains peace through consultation and mutual concession, then the great powers may exert international pressure on China and Japan to end the war through negotiations; 4. China's economic situation has not caused major social changes due to the war; 6. The Soviet Union, by actively assisting China, has greatly increased its prestige in China, but the intellectual class ruling China firmly believes that if China obtains lasting peace, then it must lean towards London and Washington when carrying out the revival process.

After extracting the above five points worthy of comment, the first reaction that arises intuitively is the deep conviction that officials' talks should not be equated with the official expressions of the authorities, and the deep suspicion that the tone has been distorted.

Next, please allow me to separately describe my thoughts on the above five points: Regarding the Sino-Japanese war, Japan has no way to clean up the war; to conquer China is impossible, considering its assessed strength, and to use puppets to control Chinese is impossible, knowing that tests have failed; to use puppets to act as the protagonists of the so-called new order is factually disproven as impossible as the military occupation zones are threatened by guerrilla forces. As for China, it has been responding to war from the beginning, not initiating it, defending itself and seeking survival, not invading. Therefore, fundamentally, it does not want war. It only had no choice but to fight when forced to do so; and because its survival is at stake, it does not dare to speak of ending the war unless it wins, and it does not dare to think of making peace unless Japan stops its aggression and withdraws its troops. Precisely because of this, regardless of whether the Sino-Japanese war will end in fact with a Far Eastern international conference in the future, and regardless of whether any of our allied countries have proposed to China to convene a Far Eastern international conference in the international arena, how dare China, which is in the midst of fighting for its survival, place the slightest hope on an international conference that would cause China to stop resisting and attempt to make peace? In other words: The issue of the Far Eastern international conference depends on Japan, while China, at this stage, has absolutely no such issue of a Far Eastern international conference. In fact, the so-called Far Eastern issue is originally just a question of whether Japan invades or not. No invasion means no war, which means peace. No invasion and a plan to handle the aftermath of the war is good, a Far Eastern international conference is good, and direct negotiations are also good. In other words; it can only be said that Japan must stop invading, and there is no such thing as China needing an international conference.

Regarding the so-called issue of suppressing communism, I only suspect that the telegraph's Morse code was incorrect. Because the Communist Party in China is loyal to the nation and devoted to resisting the enemy, there is nothing to suppress, nor should it be suppressed. There is also no communism in Japan that needs to be suppressed, or that should be suppressed. Soviet Russia is indeed a communist country, but that is Soviet Russia's business. The facts are all before our eyes: China has not been threatened by Soviet Russia, nor has Soviet Russia invaded Japan. Therefore, there is no issue of suppressing communism in the Far East, so how can there be a so-called "complex event?" Why wait for a so-called "proper solution!"

Regarding the Sino-Japanese war and the overall European situation, there is a non-isolatable impact between them. However, China only hopes that the European disputes will be resolved peacefully; if, unfortunately, war cannot be avoided, then no matter what the outcome is, no matter how thick or thin China's feelings towards the various countries are, and no matter how the war between the various countries affects China, China, under aggression, will definitely continue to resist to the end. The strategic factors on which the decision to advance, retreat, defend, or attack is based are consistent; that Japan must stop its aggression, and China must fight until final victory are consistent; how can there be such a thing as a counteroffensive if Britain and France are victorious? How can there be such a thing as starting to seek victory if Britain and France are victorious?

Regarding China's economic situation and post-war tendencies, the foundation of China's economy lies in its rural areas, which have not yet been modernized. Only in the rural areas, does the foundation occupy a congenital and vast space. Only this space is not afraid of trampling and can be used for sustained operations, consuming violence and subduing the enemy's life, which is the main factor. To say that the war will cause major changes in general economic and social organization is only true for industrial and commercial capital countries. Only without great changes, will the post-war revival depend on obtaining assistance for revival; the source of assistance is where the inclination lies; whether the assistance is obtained from Britain, the United States, Soviet Russia, there is no choice among them; this is not subject to subjective preferences, nor can it be shifted by empty talk of closeness or distance. To say that it must lean towards London and Washington is indeed good and亲近, but to assert it now, is it not too early!

In short, the issues discussed by a certain official are very interesting. However, there are contents that we cannot rashly agree with, and I have described my thoughts here.

### Border Conflicts Erupt Frequently, Japanese-Russian Relations are Tense, Japanese-Puppet Troops' Provocation Repelled, South Manchuria Railway Busy Transporting Troops

(Moscow) February 6th. A detachment of Soviet border guards, under the command of Lieutenant Yu Xike of the Novotsurukhaidu border station, stationed on Soviet-owned island No. 227 on the Ergune River, 1.5 kilometers east of the border station, was suddenly fired upon by a detachment of Japanese-puppet soldiers with rifles. The border guards immediately returned fire, forcing the Japanese-puppet soldiers to retreat to the Japanese-puppet border station 4 kilometers southeast of Novotsurukhaidu village. The Soviet side suffered no casualties. The next day, Japanese-puppet troops again opened fire with heavy machine guns from the puppet territory towards Lieutenant Yu's border guards. Under the cover of two heavy machine guns and fifty infantry rifles in the puppet territory, they concentrated forty men to land on the aforementioned island and attack Lieutenant Yu's detachment. After receiving reinforcements from the border station, the border guards defeated the Japanese-puppet troops, forcing them to withdraw from the island and retreat to the puppet territory. The Red Army suffered one death and two injuries.

Several days ago, the Soviet government issued a warning to the Japanese government regarding the provocations of the Japanese-puppet troops. Today, the Japanese-puppet troops continue to provoke. The Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Tokyo has been instructed to protest to the Japanese government again, demanding that they be stopped.

According to the Qiqihar Treaty concluded in 1911 between the Chinese government and the former Imperial Russian government, the aforementioned Island No. 227 on the Ergune River and Island No. 279, where a conflict occurred on January 31, both belong to the Soviet Union. (TASS dispatch on the 9th)

(Hong Kong) Foreign news reports that due to the increasingly sharp fishing industry issue between Japan and the Soviet Union, the Japanese military, eager to transport troops and ammunition, has designated the South Manchuria Railway exclusively for military use starting from the 1st. Passenger ticket sales between Dalian and Changchun have been suspended, and a large number of troops, ammunition, and military provisions are being transported to northern Manchuria.

### Important Documents Stolen from the Japanese Army Ministry, Sold to Soviet Minister of War by Anti-War Association Chairman Kobayashi, Criticized by Prince Kan'in

(Hong Kong) Foreign news reports that anti-war sentiment is developing widely within Japan and is now tending towards action. A large number of officials in the Army Ministry have secretly joined the Anti-War Association. On December 30th of last year, important official documents from the Army Ministry were stolen by Machijiri, an official in the military, and sold to Kobayashi, the chairman of the association, who secretly sold them to a certain country. Because one part of the documents concerned the Japanese military's war preparations and methods of troop replenishment, and another part concerned the operational plan against the Soviet Union in northern Manchuria, both of which were extremely important, Minister of War Itagaki was severely reprimanded by Chief of the General Staff Prince Kan'in. Now Itagaki is conducting a massive search, and Machijiri and others have been severely punished. Several officials in the Army Ministry have also been implicated, while Kobayashi, the chairman of the Anti-War Association, has fled to the United States. (Dispatch on the 9th)

### Chen Shouming in Chongqing, Pays Respects to Chairman Lin

(Chongqing) Overseas Chinese Senator Chen Shouming, after arriving in Chongqing, paid respects to Chairman Lin together with his secretary He Xiang, and successively visited the heads of various ministries and commissions. Chairman Lin and others greatly comforted and encouraged Chen for his services to the country overseas. Chairman Chiang was also very clear about Chen's efforts overseas and will summon him in the coming days. Furthermore, as a prominent overseas Chinese merchant, Chen is deeply interested in developing the motherland's economy. He plans to be hosted by the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the coming days and go to various places to inspect transportation and economic development in the rear, as well as other aspects of construction.

### Japanese Troops in Hankou Organize a Large-Scale Anti-War Movement, Preparing to Unite with Various Parties to Hold a Major Riot, The Plot Leaked and Nearly One Hundred People Arrested

(Hong Kong) Anti-war sentiment among Japanese troops is rising. Recently, the Japanese troops in Hankou have a large-scale anti-war organization, preparing to unite with anti-war elements from various parties to carry out a large-scale riot, echoing the riot of Japanese troops in Tianjin some time ago. Unexpectedly, the plot leaked and was discovered by the Japanese Kempeitai Headquarters, which arrested twelve ringleaders, thirty army officers and soldiers, fifty-five rōnin, and eight White Russians. These anti-war elements have already been escorted to Shanghai for punishment by Sato, the chief of the political training section. (Dispatch on the 9th)

(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources, the left-leaning ideology among Japanese troops in China is rising due to the reversal of the war situation, and various secret organizations are developing rapidly. A group called the Seinen-tō has established a branch in Hongkou, Shanghai, led by a young soldier. The internal organization is quite strict. Initially, it was just a propaganda of an ideology, but recently it has been put into practical action. Left-leaning leaflets of theirs are often found in the Hongkou area, and there are even slogans supporting the Three Principles of the People, which proves that the Japanese warlords' war of aggression has now inevitably triggered a surge of anger in their own people's revolution.

### Xiong Deshan Dies of Illness

Guilin, Guangxi. Xiong Deshan, a famous professor at Guangxi University, died of illness a few days ago. The cultural circles here deeply mourn his passing and are planning to hold a memorial meeting. Professor Xiong was fifty years old and was one of the few historians in the country. He had profound research in philosophy, economics, political science, sociology, etc., and was therefore able to provide an accurate analysis of Chinese history. The professor had many writings and translations during his lifetime, and his contribution to culture was enormous. His sudden death is a great loss to the Chinese academic community.

### Wu Peifu's Adopted Son Issues Written Statement, Willing to Work for Peace if China's Territorial Sovereignty is Intact, Whether This is Wu's True Intention is Difficult to Confirm

(Beiping) Wu Qixun (transliteration), the adopted son of Wu Peifu, hosted a banquet last night and issued a written statement with ambiguous meaning, roughly saying that recently, outsiders have been asking him about his father's views and position on the current situation. He himself is still in his school days, young and lacking in learning, and should not comment on politics. However, since he has received frequent inquiries from all parties, he will, from the position of a son, elaborate on his father's attitude towards the current situation. He often heard his father say, "Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he has been deeply worried. My father believes that all people are born equal and free. Since the rise of the theory of natural selection, there has been cruel warfare. It has been more than twenty years since the Great War, but the world's vitality has not yet recovered. Japan has suffered from the aftermath of the World War and has been unable to expand its trade, so the impact it has suffered is very great. As for China, it has already had twenty years of civil war, and its national strength has visibly declined, so it should not suffer from the scourge of war again. But unfortunately, the war has been prolonged and has now lasted for two years. If it is prolonged further, then no matter who wins or loses, they will all perish together. There is an ancient saying, 'Weapons are ominous instruments, and if they are not restrained, they will consume themselves.' Therefore, my father deeply hopes that both sides will take this as a warning. However, although my father loves peace, his so-called peace is by no means that China should surrender to Japan. My father believes that China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity must be completely intact. Whether my father will come out of seclusion depends on whether these basic conditions can be realized. Furthermore, my father must be able to have freedom of action, my father must possess military force, and he must be free to express his personal views. If these points can be achieved, then my father will be able to take on the mission of peace. Also, my father has retired from politics in recent years and has been engaged in writing, and he has no political ambitions. He simply does not want the people to suffer, so he has only slightly expressed his views." Wu Qixun added that this is roughly what he has heard from his father's usual conversations. According to the draft speech given by Wu Peifu to the Associated Press when he met with Chinese and foreign journalists on January 30, the general idea was also as above, but the tone was slightly stronger. Therefore, it can be considered Wu Peifu's view, but Wu has been living in seclusion recently and cannot be met, so it is difficult to confirm whether his intention is indeed as such.

### Japan Illegally Blockades the Pearl River, Britain Prepares to Negotiate Again, Japan Does Not Intend to Respond Immediately to Memorandums from Britain, the United States, and France

(London) British Under-Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons yesterday in response to a question from Milner of the Conservative Party that the petition from the Hong Kong British Chamber of Commerce, conveyed by the British Consul-General in Guangzhou, requesting the British government to pay attention to the continued blockade of the Pearl River, is now receiving the government's urgent consideration and that the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce will be replied to by the appropriate authorities soon. The government advocates continuing to find ways to achieve the goal of opening the Pearl River. Alexander of the Labour Party asked whether the government anticipates that the Pearl River negotiations will be more effective than the Yangtze River negotiations. Butler replied that the questioner must know that the Pearl River is an area that the Japanese side can designate as a military activity area, so there are some difficulties, but the British government is currently doing its best to negotiate. Milner asked whether the blockade of the Pearl River is a completely illegal act if Japan has not formally declared war on China. Butler replied that the government will keep in mind the various considerations regarding this matter. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)

(London) British Under-Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons yesterday in response to a question from Milner of the Conservative Party that the matter of Japan preventing the Shanghai Dredging Bureau from carrying out channel dredging work is still under discussion. Some progress has been made in this matter. Foreign Secretary Halifax has not recently received any reports of channel siltation. Milner asked whether the government could apply some pressure to the Japanese government, as this matter would not only benefit Britain but also benefit all countries. Butler replied that the British government is presenting the importance of this matter in the course of the Shanghai negotiations. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)

(Hong Kong) Tokyo news reports that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, while answering questions from lawmakers in the House of Representatives budget debate this afternoon, used extremely arrogant wording. The main points were: The government does not intend to submit a reply immediately to the memorandums to Japan from the governments of Britain, the United States, and France; the governments of Britain, the United States, and France will not take joint action on all issues; even if the three countries take joint action, the Japanese government does not want to attach importance to it. Arita continued, "Japan attaches great importance to Japanese-American relations. The issue of submitting replies to the British and American governments is currently under investigation by the authorities. As for how to reply and when to reply, everything has not been decided." Regarding the rumors that Britain and the United States are taking joint action against Japan, Arita said that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese incident, Britain and the United States have not taken joint action, but the two countries have recently submitted notes to Japan with the same wording, and the oral expressions of the ambassadors of the two countries to the Japanese government also have the same wording. Although both ambassadors have expressed that the two countries have taken action after consultation, this cannot be considered a joint action by the two countries. At the same time, according to Paris newspapers, France's submission of a memorandum to Japan does not mean that France is taking joint action with Britain and the United States. Arita said that Britain and the United States lack common interests in the Far East, so the two countries will not take joint action, and even if the two countries take joint action, Japan does not need to attach importance to it.

### Japanese Warship Runs Aground

(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources, a Japanese transport ship weighing 5,660 tons ran aground on an island in the Hongji Bay near the northeast of Haiphong a few days ago due to mistaking its course. It is said that there were not many soldiers on board, but there was a lot of military equipment. After the ship ran aground, it immediately sent out a distress signal, which attracted the attention of the French Navy. It is also said that the ship has now run aground and the hull has been severely damaged, but there is no immediate danger of sinking. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 9th)

### U.S. Congressman Proposes Convening International Conference to Discuss Disarmament and Rebuild Peace, Echoing Chamberlain's Proposal

(Washington) The U.S. Congress is planning today to convene an international disarmament conference. This move is entirely in line with British Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent statement in the House of Commons that he will try to hold a world peace conference. Representative Lauterbach of the Indiana Democratic Party has sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull, suggesting that the United States convene a world naval conference to discuss the issue of limiting armaments. This letter was delivered to Hull immediately after a speech by Congressman Kim of the Utah Democratic Party. According to Congressman Kim, he will try to obtain international agreement by a resolution of the Senate to reduce or limit armaments. (Associated Press dispatch on the 8th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain said in the House of Commons today that Britain is currently working hard to prepare to hold a world peace conference. Chamberlain made this statement in response to a question about the government's attitude towards using this conference to remedy the economic, financial, and political crises. (Associated Press dispatch on the 8th)

(Paris) U.S. Ambassador Bullitt, after returning from Washington, visited Foreign Minister Bonnet here today and told him about the evolution of U.S. foreign policy. While Ambassador Bullitt was in Washington, he held many talks with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, and, together with Ambassador Kennedy to Britain, reported on the European situation to the Senate Army Committee. At that time, it was widely rumored that the ambassadors had said that a European war this spring was inevitable. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)

### Hiranuma Explains Future Policy, Promote Industrial Production, Konoe Remains in Current Position

(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hiranuma stated last night at a banquet hosted by former Prime Minister Konoe for members of the House of Peers that Konoe has no intention of resigning from his concurrent position as Minister Without Portfolio because he requested Konoe to take this position to indicate that the policies of the previous cabinet will continue, and the political situation has not changed. Hiranuma also mentioned the government's future policy, saying that it will focus its efforts on expanding the productivity of various industries and strengthening the mobilization of various items.

### The Netherlands Does Not Abandon Overseas Territories, Britain and the Netherlands Exchange Information on Far East Joint Defense at Any Time

The Hague. Minister of Economic Affairs Welter declared in the House of Representatives that the Netherlands will never abandon any of its overseas colonies, no matter how small their area. (Havas dispatch on the 9th)

(London) During a cabinet meeting in the House of Commons this afternoon, opposition Labour Party member Fletcher asked whether the two governments have held talks regarding the issue of defense cooperation between Britain and the Netherlands in the Far East. Under-Secretary of State Butler replied, "The British government has regularly exchanged information on various technical issues related to national defense with certain governments, including the Dutch government. Apart from this, no special talks have been conducted." According to the Standard Evening News, Dutch Foreign Minister Patijn is extremely worried because Germany's expansion of power in Europe is enough to threaten the Netherlands, and Japan's expansion of power in the Far East is also enough to endanger the Dutch East Indies. He will come to London within a week to hold talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)

### The United States Should Strengthen National Defense Urgently, The House Committee Passes Bill Based on Roosevelt's Message

(Washington) President Roosevelt submitted a national defense message to Congress on the 12th of last month (proposing to immediately allocate US$552,000,000 to strengthen national defense). Afterwards, the House Army Committee, based on this message, unanimously passed a bill yesterday, which has been submitted to the House Secretariat today. Its contents include the construction of 3,032 army aircraft and the designation of US$32,000,000 for training civilian aviation pilots and subsidizing private aircraft factories. It also designates US$23,000,000 for strengthening the defense of the Panama Canal. The committee provided a separate opinion on this bill, stating briefly that "the European crisis is fraught with danger, and the disaster of war is about to break out." This can be seen from the large purchases of aircraft by Britain and France. In view of this situation, the United States should immediately increase the total number of army aircraft and strengthen other defenses so that the United States can be prepared for any eventuality. It is necessary to maintain the coast with this sufficient strength of both the army and the air force. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)

### Poland's Position is Pivotal, German Newspaper Continues to Vigorously Criticize Roosevelt

(Berlin) German newspapers seem to be concerned about Poland's strong attitude towards dictatorial countries, believing that it was caused by President Roosevelt's recent remarks, so they have begun to criticize President Roosevelt again. The Hamburg Daily News said that a certain Polish newspaper openly discussed the issue of France and Poland repairing their old friendship, saying first that President Roosevelt's actions have given France and Poland's cooperation a great impetus. The newspaper and the National Daily News both said that President Roosevelt should be held responsible for the resurgence of international tensions. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)

### Amidst Tense Franco-Italian Relations, Italy Continues to Increase Troops in North Africa, Military Preparations are Still Underway and Not Alarmed by British-French Cooperation

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain made a declaration in the House of Commons this afternoon, stating that according to information obtained by the government, the Italian government is about to send 30,000 army troops to the Libyan colony in North Africa. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)

(London) Well-informed sources here declared that after Italy recently sent 30,000 army troops to the Libyan colony in North Africa, another 30,000 troops will be sent in the coming days to strengthen defenses. British officials said that France has a large force stationed in North Africa, which is enough to prevent Italy from recklessly invading French Tunisia. The Italian government's repeated increase in troops to Libya, although said to be intended to raise the number of troops to be on par with France, in fact, the threat to Britain is at least equal to that of France, because the threat to Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in the future is no different from the situation when Italy repeatedly increased troops to Libya before the signing of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. Prime Minister Chamberlain just made a declaration in the House of Commons on the 6th of this month, stating that when France is threatened, no matter where the threat comes from, Britain will provide France with full assistance. The Italian government's increase of troops to Libya at this time is by no means a coincidence. According to news from Burgos, Spain, the Spanish National Army government is financially strapped and intends to send Italian volunteers back to their country as soon as possible so that it can obtain loans from Britain. The relationship between these Italian volunteers and Spanish National Army officers and soldiers is also extremely bad, and it is indeed difficult to continue this cooperation for a long time. All of these things weaken Italy's position in the Mediterranean. According to news from Rome, Italy is extremely uneasy after the resignation of the Stojadinović cabinet in Yugoslavia, because the new Prime Minister Cvetković of Southern Country is known to be pro-French. If Italy has a conflict with France in the future, it must also station troops in the border area adjacent to Southern Country to prevent accidents. According to news from Burgos, Spain, the National Army government of Western Country is facing financial difficulties and intends to send the Italian volunteers back to their country as soon as possible in order to obtain loans from Britain. The relationship between these Italian volunteers and the officers and soldiers of the Western National Army is also extremely bad, and it is indeed difficult to maintain this cooperation for a long time. All of these things will weaken Italy's position in the Mediterranean. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)

Rome. Official diplomatic intelligence agencies today reported that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent remarks in the House of Commons about British-French unity and cooperation did not surprise responsible circles in Rome. Fascist Italy was not alarmed by this because Italy had already recognized that the existence of a true British-French military alliance was inevitable. At this time, there is no need to be concerned about whether this military alliance is for defensive warfare against omnipotent countries or for aggressive warfare, otherwise we will have no way to explain the Anglo-Soviet Agreement of April 16 last year and the Franco-German Agreement of December 6. Italy will continue to pursue its peace policy, but it cannot but draw the conclusion that Italy must continue to work hard to accelerate the completion of national military preparations. This kind of effort will definitely be successful. (Reuters dispatch on the 8th)

### French Defense Committee Holds Joint Meeting, Ministers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force All Attend, Naval Strength is Sufficient to Cope with Incidents

(Paris) The Naval, Army, and Air Force Committees of the Senate held a joint meeting this morning. Minister of National Defense and Minister of the Army Daladier, Minister of the Navy Campinchi, and Minister of Aviation La Chambre all attended in person. The discussion mainly focused on naval issues. First, the rapporteur presented a report, stating that the general situation of the French fleet is satisfactory, and that it is sufficient to cope with any incident, whether alone or in cooperation with the British Navy. Minister Campinchi then explained the general situation of the French fleet, as well as the shipbuilding situation, and said that French shipbuilding matters have been actively implemented according to an overall plan. (Havas dispatch on the 9th)

(Paris) Since the European War, the Defense Committee held a meeting here today for only the second time, because the committee is only convened in times of crisis. The purpose of today's meeting was to listen to a report on the rearmament of France. There are a total of three meetings this week. At a time when Franco-Italian relations are tense, these meetings are generally considered important. (Associated Press dispatch on the 9th)

(Paris) The French right-wing newspaper "Journal" reported this morning that Prime Minister Daladier made a speech at a closed-door meeting of the Defense Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives, stating that if war breaks out, France must fight alone in the first week, because British assistance cannot be so rapid. However, Daladier solemnly declared that Britain would do its utmost to assist France. A certain senator immediately asked the Prime Minister, "If a war breaks out, can we get effective assistance from the Soviet Union?" To this, the Prime Minister's answer was ambiguous, only hinting at the relations between the Soviet Union and Poland and Romania. Regarding the strength of the French army, the Prime Minister declared that although the number of recruits is extraordinarily small at present, after this stage, the number of recruits in France will increase significantly every year, reaching about 100,000 in the first year and 150,000 in the second year. Daladier also provided assurances to the meeting, saying that the mobilization experience in France in September of last year revealed many shortcomings, which have now been completely improved, and it can be guaranteed that there will be no worries when the mobilization order is exercised in the future.

### Spanish Nationalist Army Lands on Minorca Island; Fierce Fighting with Government Garrison; Britain Actively Involved; Rome Indignant

Burgos: Nationalist forces have landed on Minorca Island and are fighting with government troops (Havas, 9th).

(London) Of the Spanish-owned Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean, Majorca Island has been occupied by Nationalist forces. However, Minorca Island is still garrisoned by Spanish government troops. Diplomatic sources here claim that Colonel Luis, commander of the Nationalist forces on Majorca Island, recently sailed to Mahon, Minorca Island, aboard the British cruiser HMS "Devonshire," where he immediately discussed takeover matters with the authorities on Minorca Island (Havas, 9th).

(London) Colonel Luis, commander of the Nationalist forces on Spanish-owned Majorca Island, sailed to Mahon, Minorca Island yesterday aboard the British cruiser HMS "Devonshire" to confer with representatives of the government forces on the island regarding the takeover of Minorca Island. It is understood that the ship has already left Mahon but is still anchored off the coast of Minorca Island. According to reports received here, a British official was present when Colonel Luis negotiated with the representatives of Minorca Island on the ship yesterday. Diplomatic sources claim that the British government's task is only to mediate between the two sides of the Spanish civil war. It was only at the request of the Nationalist authorities that the cruiser HMS "Devonshire" was provided for their use (Havas, 9th).

(Rome) Foreign reports suggest that Britain intends to assist the Spanish Nationalist forces in taking over Minorca Island. Newspapers here have expressed indignation upon hearing this. Il Piccolo stated, "This is a British strategy, the purpose of which is to prevent Italian legionnaires from participating when the Nationalist forces occupy Minorca Island." Il Popolo di Roma stated that Britain is encouraging the Nationalist authorities to occupy the island, but on the condition that Italian legionnaires do not participate. The British government is even preparing to provide several warships for the Nationalist forces to use for troop deployment in preparation for taking over the island (Havas, 9th).

Saint-Barthélemy: News arrived last night from Minorca Island, which is controlled by government forces, stating that a bloody incident has occurred among the residents of the island. For two weeks, no ships or vessels have delivered food, and a food panic has nearly broken out. Since the Nationalist forces occupied Barcelona, the government forces' supply of food to the island has been cut off. As a result, the emotions of the islanders have risen, sparking a movement to surrender to the Nationalist forces. It is reported that the islanders have also formed processions, demanding that the island be ceded to the Nationalist forces. Nationalist planes flew to the island for reconnaissance and remotely saw that white flags or red, yellow, and red flags were hoisted on some rooftops (Haitong Telegraph, 9th).

### Nationalist Forces Advance Rapidly, Occupy Figueras with Little Resistance

Barcelona: General Franco's troops occupied the city of Figueras yesterday evening. The battle for the city was won by the Fourth Division of the Navarre Army. The attack was quite difficult because all the main roads outside the city had been completely destroyed by the government forces, and all the bridges were broken. However, there was little strong resistance. The enemy only fired machine guns to cover the retreat of their army. The city is twenty-four kilometers away from the border town of Perthus and usually has a population of about 14,000 people (Haitong Telegraph, 9th).

La Jonquera: Franco's troops arrived at the border here at 2:05 PM today (10:05 PM Shanghai time) and planted the Nationalist flag on the Spanish border (Reuters, 9th).

Burgos: The Nationalist forces have occupied Sant Joan de les Abadesses, an important industrial city 15 miles from the French-Spanish border (Reuters, 9th).

Figueras: After the Nationalist forces arrived in the city tonight, the Italian army units that had accompanied the Nationalist forces in their advance toward the French border area were transferred from the front lines to the rear (Havas, 8th).

La Jonquera: The fortress of Figueras was destroyed today, and the sound of the explosion was terrifying. It is not yet certain whether it was intentionally destroyed or accidental. A few days ago, the Republican government's cabinet and ministers were still using the cellar under the fortress to hold cabinet meetings. The government had just moved away when the fortress became the target of repeated bombing by Nationalist planes. At the same time, the Nationalist forces advanced towards Figueras amidst strong resistance from the Republican army (Reuters, 8th).

### London Observes the Situation in Spain; Ceasefire Not Far Off; Britain and France Striving to Mediate; Berlin and Rome Gradually Feeling Uneasy

(London) The British government believes that the Spanish government forces' strength to resist has greatly weakened, and a ceasefire is not far off. Britain's diplomacy with the Spanish Nationalist forces will then be correspondingly developed. Regarding this matter, the Foreign Office is currently awaiting two reports. One is the answer of General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist forces, to the peace terms proposed by the Republican government. The other is the report of the government forces authorities on Spanish-owned Minorca Island regarding the negotiations for the takeover of the island with the Nationalist representatives on the British cruiser HMS "Devonshire" yesterday. In addition, after the Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican government, Negrín, met with representatives of Britain and France yesterday, he confirmed that there were three conditions for a ceasefire: 1. Withdrawal of foreign volunteers; 2. Issuance of a general amnesty; 3. Holding a plebiscite. Yesterday, it was reported that General Franco was willing to accept the first and second conditions, but firmly rejected the third. Although Prime Minister Negrín and General Miaja, commander of the Central Army, said that if the above three conditions were not fully accepted by the Nationalist forces, the government forces would continue to resist to the end, British officials believe that the Republican government's adoption of this attitude is to seek more favorable conditions and not to truly resist to the end. Therefore, even if the Nationalist government insists on its original position and refuses to accept the third condition, the door for mediating the war will not be completely closed. According to news from Rome and Berlin, the British and French governments have had many contacts with the Spanish Nationalist authorities, and the German and Italian governments have become increasingly uneasy. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, after Prime Minister Chamberlain visited Pope Pius XI in Rome last month, the Vatican urged the Spanish Nationalist authorities not to go too far. This is related to General Franco's current friendly attitude towards Britain and France (Havas, 9th).

(Berlin) German newspapers believe that the reported mediation of the Spanish civil war by Britain and France is "diplomatic interference." The Völkischer Beobachter, the mouthpiece of the Nazi Party, stated that there is currently a clear attempt to hinder Franco from achieving a victorious peace. The actions of Britain and France are purely for power and political considerations, because Spain has a special relationship with the position of Britain and France in the Mediterranean (Reuters, 7th).

### Internal Disagreements within the Spanish Government; Prime Minister Advocates Continuing Resistance; Azaña May Resign

(Paris) Spanish President Azaña arrived here this morning from Geneva. The Spanish Ambassador to France and representatives of the French Foreign Ministry welcomed him at the station. Sources close to the Spanish government army suggest that Spanish Prime Minister Negrín may resign due to disagreements with the Spanish President regarding the issue of continuing resistance against the Nationalist forces. Some French newspapers are urging the authorities to immediately fully recognize General Franco, the leader of the Nationalist forces, so that France can provide effective assistance in resolving the Spanish conflict (Reuters, 9th).

Perthus, France: The Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican government, Negrín, along with Finance Minister Aspe, Army Chief of Staff General Rojo, and other important figures, came here from Spain today. The military attaché of the French Embassy in Spain and representatives of the Spanish Embassy in France greeted them at the station. Spanish Foreign Minister Del Vayo subsequently gave a speech to the newspapers, saying that Prime Minister Negrín was extremely grateful for the kindness and assistance of the French authorities in helping Spanish refugees. According to well-informed sources, Prime Minister Negrín will return to the city of Valencia, Spain, to continue to preside over the resistance after all the government troops on the Catalonia Autonomous Region front line have safely retreated into France (Havas, 8th).

(Paris) The French government is now considering recognizing the Nationalist government of Franco in Spain, based on the draft resolution brought back by Senator Bérard, who recently went to Burgos as an unofficial envoy. It is expected that the Nationalist forces will reach the French border in several places today. The main force of the government troops in the interior and along the coast may cross into French territory at any time. According to news from Madrid, mediation is unlikely to be achieved, and the government will continue to resist. The new headquarters of the government army will likely be located in Alicante, Cartagena, or Albacete (Reuters, 9th).

### French Representative Returns to Paris; Reports to Foreign Minister Bonnet on the Negotiations in Spain

(Paris) Bérard, the unofficial French ambassador to the Nationalist capital, returned from Burgos yesterday and paid a visit to Foreign Minister Bonnet at noon. It is said that Bérard reported on his meetings with Nationalist Foreign Minister General Jordana and General Franco's staff. Prime Minister Daladier also received Bérard. Sources in charge say that Bérard told Bonnet that the talks he had held in Spain were very sincere and that the Nationalist authorities had understood this, with which he was very satisfied. The main purpose of Bérard's mission was to deal with the refugee problem. According to Bérard, the Nationalist authorities and France are equally eager for the refugees to return home. The French government will now study the issue of establishing normal diplomatic relations with Burgos. Bérard will return to Spain after the government has decided on this issue (Reuters, 8th).

(Paris) Bérard, the French Senator who was sent to Burgos, paid a visit to Prime Minister Daladier yesterday to report on the results of his talks in Spain, expressing optimism about the future of Franco-Spanish relations. Bérard stated that there were no major difficulties between France and Spain at present. The two countries were completely dependent on each other economically and culturally, so the traditional Franco-Spanish friendship would not undergo any adverse changes. Political figures did not fully agree with Bérard's optimistic attitude. It was pointed out that there were still many difficulties in adjusting relations between France and the Spanish Nationalist forces. In addition to the many opposing opinions within France, many issues remained unresolved in Bérard's negotiations with Spanish Nationalist Foreign Minister Jordana. The most important of these was the issue of the return of Spanish government troops to Spanish territory. The French authorities believed that they had a responsibility to plan properly for the safety of these Spanish soldiers seeking refuge in France. In other words, they had to obtain guarantees from the Nationalist authorities before agreeing to hand over the Spanish government troops in the French concentration camps to the Spanish Nationalist forces. Secondly, the issue of the return of Spanish military supplies now in France would also cause major difficulties. Before handing over these military supplies to the Nationalist forces, France would first need to discuss the diplomatic and legal relations between the two countries in detail (Haitong Telegraph, 9th).

### General Miaja Expresses Determination to Fight to the End

(London) General Miaja, commander-in-chief of the Spanish government forces, told a special correspondent of the Daily Express today that he had no intention of leaving the government army and conducting peace talks with Franco. Miaja emphasized, "We will continue to resist. Even if heaven abandons us, we will do what we know is impossible. Moreover, the government army still has more than 500,000 well-trained and fully equipped troops, and there are still 500,000 reserve troops that can continue to fight" (Haitong Telegraph, 9th).

### More Than 80,000 Republican Soldiers Have Entered France in the Last Two Days

(Paris) Today, the Republican army accelerated its withdrawal from Catalonia and is now crossing the border into France in an orderly fashion, led by officers, rather than in scattered small groups. It is estimated that more than 80,000 Republican soldiers have been disarmed since 4:00 PM yesterday. On one occasion, an entire battalion of 600 soldiers, 20 cars, and 50 donkey carts retreated to the border. The 26th Division, entirely composed of anarchist members, retreated to Puigcerdà at night. According to the Republican army, they used tanks as a rearguard to protect the retreat, and the order was well-maintained. It is rumored that almost all of the Republican army's artillery has been withdrawn (Reuters, 8th).

### Palestinian Problem Conference Opens Yesterday; Britain Holds First Talks with Jewish Representatives

(London) British representatives and Jewish representatives held their first talks on the Palestinian problem at St. James's Palace at 10:00 PM tonight. The Jewish delegation, led by Dr. Weizmann, Chairman of the Jewish Agency, will present its views on Jewish demands. It is likely that what he will say will be largely the same as what he said to the Palestine Royal Commission in 1936. Today, the two Arab parties were in contact with each other, and a kind of direct contact has been established between them. This can be seen from the fact that Sheikh al-Mughrabi (former Egyptian Prime Minister) and Hamouda (Foreign Minister of the Kingdom of Hejaz), representatives of the Grand Mufti's party, visited representatives of the Arab Defense Party this morning. After a brief one-hour talk, representatives of the Defense Party visited Arab representative Fakhri al-Nashashibi at the hotel and dined with Prince Saif al-Islam of Yemen. They then drove to the British House of Commons to meet with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and held talks with Colonial Secretary MacDonald (Reuters, 8th).

(London) The two Arab delegations attending the Palestine Conference are said to have resolved their differences. Representatives of the Defense Party will participate in the discussions of the conference at the same time as representatives of the Arab Higher Committee. One of the elected representatives has not yet arrived in London, but those who have arrived will attend the meeting this afternoon (Reuters, 9th).

### Fire Breaks Out in Sugar-Producing Area of the Philippines; 3,000 Homeless; Suspected Arson by Strikers

(Manila) A large fire broke out in the suburbs of San Fernando, Pampanga Province. According to the governor's estimate, the losses amounted to 1.5 million pesos. Although there were no deaths or injuries, 3,000 people were left homeless. The area is a wealthy sugar-producing region, and thousands of factory workers have recently gone on strike. The fire is suspected to be arson, motivated by resentment over the police's disbanding of gatherings. The local Catholic Church, a symbol of ancient times in the Philippines, was also among those destroyed. In addition, many Chinese-owned bakeries and hardware stores were burned down. Trains departing from San Fernando were filled with disaster-stricken people, while trains heading to the area were filled with rescue teams and news reporters. The fire started at night and was not contained until 12:30 PM today. The fire started in a vegetable market and quickly spread due to the arid weather. By 8:00 AM this morning, the estimated losses had reached 500,000 pesos. The farmers in Pampanga Province were extremely agitated last night, and the authorities dispatched additional police to suppress them. The farmers were dissatisfied with the authorities' forcible order to resolve the strike according to their terms, but the factory workers have agreed to resume work. The situation is quite bad. Philippine President Quezon has decided to personally go to the area within a few days to advise the strikers not to make excessive demands (Reuters, 9th).

### Japanese Small Political Parties Fail to Form a Unified Party

(Tokyo) The movement to merge all small political parties into a new, all-powerful party has failed. However, the Social Masses Party, which holds 30 seats in the House of Representatives, and the Johokai, which holds 12 seats, merged today. The former is one of Japan's proletarian parties, while the latter is organized by conservatives and extreme right-wing elements. If the new party is formed according to the policy set by its initiators, it will hold 70 seats in the House of Representatives (Reuters, 9th).

### Japanese Naval Spokesman Explains Reason for Detaining British Ship

(Tokyo) According to a Japanese naval spokesman today, British ships often transport military supplies to various Chinese ports, the purpose of which is obviously to undermine the effectiveness of the Japanese navy's blockade of Chinese ports. The Japanese spokesman's remarks were made in response to the British warship HMS "Birmingham" rescuing a certain British ship and said that Japan believes that this incident should be noted. According to the spokesman, among the British ships that were escorted to Qingdao by the Japanese navy last week, many of the items carried were gasoline and military supplies, obviously to supply the Chinese army (Associated Press, 9th).

### Belgian Cabinet Resigns

Brussels: The Pierlot cabinet submitted its resignation to the King today (Havas, 9th).

Brussels: After the government appointed Dr. Maerten as a member of the Flemish Medical Research Institute earlier this month, the Liberal Party strongly opposed it. The cabinet members belonging to the party also stated that if Dr. Maerten did not resign voluntarily, they would withdraw from the cabinet. In view of the attitude of these cabinet members, Prime Minister Pierlot realized that he could no longer continue to serve and submitted his resignation to the King. Prime Minister Spaak had previously reorganized his cabinet in part on the 10th of last month due to opposition from some members of the Socialist Party regarding the dispatch of a representative to the city of Burgos, Spain, only two weeks ago (Havas, 9th).

### Japanese Submarine Collision Sinks; Only Six Survivors

(Tokyo) Japanese Navy Rear Admiral Kanazawa told foreign reporters today that the official investigation into the sinking of the submarine I-63 on February 2 due to a collision between two submarines is still ongoing. The results will be announced within a few days. It is likely that all 81 people trapped inside the submarine have no hope of survival. Kanazawa declined to provide details on the escape of the six survivors, saying that rescue work is currently underway, but it is being hampered by the very rapid currents in the area and the fact that the submarine sank 100 meters below the surface. It is said that the accident occurred before dawn when it was still dark and foggy (Reuters, 9th).

### Chinese Air Force Continues to Strengthen

### Promoting Rear Area Construction: Guiyang Today - Expanding Telecommunications, Promoting Domestic Culture, and Increasingly Developed Finance

Since the rise of the military, Guizhou has become the center of economic transportation in the southwest, and Guiyang, as the local gazetteer says, occupies the central position in the province, a hub connecting roads in all directions, and the economic and transportation hub of Guizhou Province. Guizhou has always been known as a mountain country; Guiyang is a relatively large plain in the mountains, bordering the Nanming River to the north. The city circumference is less than ten kilometers, forming an irregular ellipse. Walking at a leisurely pace, from east to west gate, it takes only twenty minutes to cross, and the north-south distance is longer, but only twice the east-west distance. Therefore, among the provincial capitals in the country, it is considered one of the smallest. Outside the city are famous scenic spots such as Qianling Mountain, East Mountain, and Guanyin Cave. It is said that Guanyin Cave can connect to Duyun, two hundred li away in the southeast. This is ultimately just a legend. The climate has no intense heat or severe cold, but the changes in temperature are perhaps second only to Kunming. It has this characteristic: as long as there is sunshine, even in the depths of winter, it can feel like early spring; and in the sweltering heat, with cloud cover, one can wear a jacket. Qianzhong was originally an area inhabited by both Han Chinese and Miao people. In Guiyang, the Miao people also account for twenty to thirty percent of the population, but apart from still wearing short clothes and floral skirts, going barefoot, wrapping their hair, and liking to wear silver ornaments, most of their matchmaking and marriage customs have followed Han customs, and they can communicate in Mandarin when interacting with the local people. The language used here is generally Sichuan Mandarin and Hunan Mandarin, but since this is a great migration of people from the coastal provinces, the accents of the Jiangnan region can be heard everywhere. I would like to report on other aspects separately, so that it can be more coherent.

Refreshing the City Appearance: In the past, due to years of war and financial poverty, the construction of the city streets was somewhat poor. Recently, the Guiyang Municipal Engineering Office of the Construction Department has actively improved the city streets, and there has been significant progress in the sanitation of the streets and the tidiness of the city appearance. Since 1928, the houses on both sides of the road have been limited to three-story Western-style buildings with facades, and there are prominent covered walkways on the sidewalks. The most prosperous section of the city is "Dashizi" (Great Crossroads), similar to Nanjing Road in Shanghai and Bajiating in Changsha. As for the so-called Western-style buildings, due to the difficulty of transporting steel and cement, this expense was spared, and only brick and wood were used, plastered with lime on the outside. Even the newly completed Bank of Communications, which looks quite impressive, is no exception. The main roads are quite wide, but the road surface is neither asphalt nor cobblestone, but muddy ground, which becomes extremely muddy after rain. It is currently being renovated with great effort. Also, due to the rapid increase in population and frequent traffic, in order to facilitate traffic and facilitate evacuation during air raids, seven or eight new city gates have been added, and a new residential area has been demarcated in the Nanming River loop. According to recent statistics, the city's population has reached over 140,000, and there are still more coming in. In view of the tragic bombing of Guilin last month, the authorities are planning to evacuate women, children, the elderly, and those who do not need to stay in the city in advance. At night, the power plant generates electricity, but the amount of electricity is too small to meet the demand. Except for the main streets, most of the small streets and alleys have no streetlights. Starting this year, the provincial government is cooperating with the Resources Committee to convert the power plant into the Guiyang Power Plant, expanding the power to 1200 kilowatts. All the machinery will be installed, so that in about two months, it can shine brightly.

Balancing Prices: Due to the unprecedented expansion of consumption, all industries seem to have a healthy glow, and the scene of shoulders rubbing and heels bumping under the electric lights looks very prosperous, much like a beggar in rags wearing a gorgeous cloak. However, the superficial luxury cannot conceal the internal poverty. Rice has risen to twenty-two yuan per dan, and sugar, salt, and daily necessities are also rising daily. Although green vegetables can sell for a good price of one mao per head, the gains do not outweigh the losses. The cost-of-living index, published monthly in the newspapers, has increased by two times compared to before the war. The local citizens are struggling to breathe under the pressure of this consumption that has jumped over a century. People who have fled from other provinces are also complaining. The housing shortage is no less than that in the Shanghai Concession. A small house that could be rented for seven or eight yuan a year in the past cannot be rented for ten yuan a month now. As a result, vacant land is being used to build houses frantically, and timber prices are soaring. A package of Wudi toothpaste costs one mao, and a bar of Guben medicated soap costs four mao. Towels, toothbrushes, and other items are even more expensive. The same items are three times more expensive than in Shanghai and Guangzhou. Therefore, balancing prices and strictly prohibiting speculation has become the most troublesome task for the authorities. The most prosperous businesses are restaurants and hotels. No fewer than seven or eight new restaurants have emerged, with Su-Xi boat dishes and Jiangnan flavors such as Yangzi Restaurant, Siwuliu Restaurant, and Pingjin cuisine such as Guduchun. Cantonese cuisine includes Sihai Restaurant. In short, regardless of Yunnan or Sichuan flavors, the seats are always full, and waiting an hour for dinner is not a rare occurrence. The most famous hotels include the Far East Hotel, Jiangnan Hotel, and Paris Hotel. The barber business is also doing well. Xuan Palace Barber Shop should be the most beautifully equipped and decorated. A haircut costs four mao, a shampoo costs one mao, and a blow-dry costs another mao, so a haircut costs six mao. Most of its customers are from the Jiangnan region. It is worth mentioning that the China National Products Company opened on New Year's Day this year, with a capital of 100,000 yuan, of which 60,000 yuan was invested by the China National Products Joint Venture Company, and the provincial government also invested 10,000 yuan. This is equivalent to a national products production and marketing cooperation organization, and its future has unlimited development prospects.

Establishing Factories: Guizhou is not like other inland provinces, with special currency systems and banknotes issued by local banks. It has long used legal tender. In the past, there were several banks in Guiyang: Central, China Farmers, and Shanghai. Later, the Jin City Bank was added. This year, the China Bank and the Bank of Communications successively established branches, so the four legal tender banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture are all present, which will undoubtedly make the finance of the entire Guizhou more active. Apart from a few match-making grass industries, there is only the model factory that should be built. Recently, in view of the increasing number of refugees coming to Guizhou, in order to enable the refugees to engage in production and increase national strength, the provincial government is also preparing to set up simple handicraft relief factories in Guiyang, and large-scale cement plants and oil presses are also being planned.

Education and Culture: There are specialized schools and above, including the National Guiyang Medical College, Shanghai Daxia University, Jiangsu Medical College, and Xiangya Medical College, which recently moved from Changsha. There are fifteen middle schools, including Daxia Middle School, Provincial Senior High School, Guiyang Middle School, Normal School, Girls' Normal School, and Zhongda Shizhong. There are twenty-two primary schools, of which girls' primary schools account for eight. A city with a radius of ten kilometers has so many schools, which is not a small number. So, in all honesty, Guizhou has fewer illiterate people than imagined. An ordinary manual worker can almost read the wall newspapers, and women's education is particularly developed. The China-Soviet Cultural Association also has a branch in Guiyang, with more than 500 members. The president is Wang Bocui, and the directors are Zhang Zhihan and Guo Yicen. They are making the greatest efforts to promote Sino-Soviet culture, and have first established a Russian language school. It cannot be denied that the literary and artistic movement is much quieter than in Chongqing, Kunming, and Guilin. However, recently, cultural figures have proposed "strengthening the cultural front and developing Guizhou culture" and organizing the Guizhou Cultural Association, which has high hopes for establishing a brand-new literary and artistic foundation in Guizhou.

All the members of the team are officers above the rank of major. The headquarters also reported that in the Shizhuang battle in Rugao last month, the Second Security Regiment fought bravely and killed many Japanese soldiers. The regiment also suffered casualties, including Li Deben and Zhang Hanqing, and about twenty others were killed, and three were injured. In order to comfort the families of the fallen soldiers of the regiment, special permission has been granted to provide preferential treatment to comfort the loyal souls. Lu Daijun, the magistrate of Jiangdu County, has resigned, and the provincial government has instructed him to transfer to another position. The vacancy will be filled by Zhang Jichuan. In addition, Zhang, the administrative inspector and district security commander of the Fourth District, resigned from his post due to his busy military affairs and inability to take care of both responsibilities. The provincial government has appointed Wu Chunke to succeed him.

### Japanese Troops in Sanyu Town Suffer Damage and Retreat

Nantong Correspondence: The Japanese troops stationed in Sijiaba, gathered about 500 people from various places such as Jinsha, and were equipped with three 75mm steel cannons, two mortars, four 53mm small steel cannons, three or four heavy machine guns, and twenty or so light machine guns. They advanced towards the positions of the Chinese army along the Sanyu-Sijiaba River at dawn on January 21. The provincial security Xu Battalion stationed in Sanyu immediately reported the information and, led by Battalion Commander Jin Cheng, personally led his troops to meet the enemy. At 4:15 AM, contact was made about half a mile south of Sanyu Town. The Japanese army launched its main force towards the east end of Sanyu Town. By 6:00 AM, the Japanese troops were facing off against the Chinese army across the river, fighting with hand grenades. The fierce battle lasted until 6:00 PM, and the Japanese army had not yet retreated. The Japanese troops who were blocked and attacked on the right wing of Sanyu Town had been surrounded by the Chinese army, and had not broken out by 6:00 PM. Zhang Xingbing, the commander of the security regiment, personally went to the front to supervise the battle and ordered Zhang Battalion to advance towards Sanyu from the west, detouring to attack the Japanese army. The Japanese army fired more than 400 shells throughout the day. After holding out until the afternoon, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the heavy casualties and retreated. The next morning, the Chinese army searched forward and captured a flag and eight rifles in the Japanese army's position. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 200 casualties and three officers were killed. The Chinese army also suffered more than 30 casualties.

### Bandits Loot Zhouzhuang

Wujiang Correspondence: The area of Wuxian and Wujiang has become a den of thieves since the incident, and the people are not living in peace. Zhouzhuang Town, southeast of Wuxian, has always been known for its prosperity. On the 3rd of this month, seventeen bandit boats came from the direction of Beiku, carrying more than 200 bandits, equipped with rifles and machine guns. The boats docked at Jubaobao Bridge and lined up to Zhouzhuang. First, a bandit leader went to Changyuan in the middle of the market street to drink tea and extort 10,000 yuan from the local merchants. As a result, the town reluctantly scraped together 3,000 yuan. The bandits were not satisfied and ordered a robbery after receiving the money. No shop or household in the entire town was spared. The heaviest losses were suffered by Gongzheng Tea and Food Store, Dai Yongmao Silk and Cloth Store, Tiansheng Cloth Store, Dewu Rice Store, Tongfeng Rice Store, Hemao Tobacco Store, Yuanfengsheng Sauce Garden, Lu Dongxing Local Goods Store, and others, amounting to tens of thousands. After robbing Zhouzhuang, the bandits went to Jinjiaba to loot on a large scale. According to the report, Zhouzhuang has been robbed five times so far, and this time the losses were the most severe.

### Japanese Warships Harass Daqiao, Attempted Landing Foiled

Taixian Correspondence: On the night of February 1st, at about 4:00 AM, two shallow-draft warships from Yangzhou came from the Japanese army. After passing Sanjiangying, they sailed into the Zhongzha River and docked. The warships were equipped with more than 300 Japanese soldiers. At dawn, they opened fire to cover an attempted landing and invasion of Daqiao. Upon hearing the news, the Chinese army immediately sent a team to the southern bank of Zhongzha to block the attack with machine gun fire. After two hours of fierce fighting, the warships escaped downstream. At the same time, about 60 Japanese soldiers from the direction of Xiannv Temple, carrying two machine guns, advanced towards Zhangwanggou. When the fierce battle stopped, the batch of Japanese soldiers retreated from Zhongzha back to Xiannv Temple.

### Japanese Troops in Hangzhou Hastily Build Defenses

Hangzhou Correspondence: The Japanese troops in Hangzhou, believing that the Chinese army was powerful and approaching the suburbs of the city, ordered the puppet provincial government to order the puppet police to conscript laborers everywhere to build strong defense works. Cannons were placed on the high mountains such as Phoenix Mountain, Yuhuang Mountain, and Maiyun Mountain. Sandbags and electric fences were piled up according to the terrain of the city and mountains. A puppet Zhejiang Peace Committee was also organized, with Watanabe, the head of the Japanese special service agency, as the secretary-general, and all the large and small puppets in Hangzhou as members.

### Puppet Organization in Haining Forcibly Forces Strong Men to Build Roads

Xiashi Correspondence: The puppet magistrate of Haining recently ordered the construction of the Xia (Xiashi)-Chang (Changan) Highway in accordance with Japanese orders. The puppet magistrate is ordering the chiefs of various towns and villages to forward the orders to their subordinates to compile a list of strong men and send them to work in batches. He is also stipulating the method of service. If a strong man is sick or has something to do and cannot serve, he must pay a substitute service fee of one yuan per day, including food costs. If someone resists the service for no reason, he will be arrested and fined, and also punished with a fine. It is reported that the project is scheduled to begin in the middle of this month, but at that time it is feared that it will proceed slowly, because the section of the road to be designated is all controlled by the Chinese army.

### Japanese Side Forcibly Occupies British Zhen Tai Yarn Factory, Although British Authorities Allowed to Inspect, Date of Return Unknown

The China Textile Industry Corporation convened a meeting yesterday, in which it presented a report stating that the British Zhen Tai Textile Factory on the Suzhou River was forcibly occupied by the Shanghai Japanese army in December of last year, and was later transferred to a Japanese yarn factory under the name of Qingniao, and is still in Japanese hands to this day, without being returned. The chairman of the meeting, Gao Mosaier, stated that the Japanese side must believe that the British authorities cannot protect the property of British expatriates. It is truly regrettable that we still do not have the right to use the yarn factory to this day. To this day, the Japanese side still has no concrete statement.

According to the Chinese-language *North China Daily News*: The China Textile Co., Ltd. held its second annual meeting at 88 Museum Road yesterday (the 8th). According to reports at the meeting, the Zhen Tai Yarn Factory (transliteration) owned by the company was located near St. John's University on the Suzhou River. In December 1937, it was seized by the Japanese army, and then the Japanese army transferred the factory to the Japanese Toyo Yarn Factory. According to Chairman Goma Sel, the situation is slightly better than last year, as the Japanese authorities have allowed the British authorities to inspect the factory in order to ascertain the state of the property. Mr. Go also reported to the shareholders that because the factory has not started work, there are no profit and loss accounts. It is still remembered that the factory was seized by the Japanese army in December of the year before last, and then handed over to the Toyo Yarn Factory. In July of last year, a special meeting of shareholders was convened to formally report this matter and request all shareholders to protest through their respective consulates. Since then, we have been in constant contact with the British authorities. The Japanese authorities then allowed the British authorities to inspect the factory, so British consular staff and others went to inspect it twice. The British Consulate has repeatedly protested, demanding that the factory be returned to us. The British Embassy in Japan has also protested. Therefore, we will soon be able to regain the factory.

### Japanese Army Intercepted at the Upper-Chuansha Border

Two Hours of Daytime Fighting

Passengers on the Upper-Chuansha Road Disappear

At 11:00 AM yesterday, another guerrilla battle took place in the countryside near Lujiahang on the Upper-Chuansha border in Pudong. A Japanese army unit, led by a puppet "army," was conducting a search when it was intercepted and attacked by the Chinese army. Both sides used machine guns and rifles. Because it was daytime, the battle lasted for two hours. The Chinese army completed its attrition strategy and retreated at 1:00 PM. When the battle was taking place, the situation along the Upper-Chuansha Road was quite tense and passengers disappeared. After the battle subsided, the Japanese army continued to search in various villages, but because the Chinese army acted unpredictably, they found nothing.

### Hexing Town Repeatedly Bombed, Shipping Disrupted

Letter from Hexing Business Firm

Hoping Foreign Ships Do Not Enter Port

Hexing Town in Funing has recently been bombed repeatedly by Japanese aircraft. Last time, three foreign transport ships carrying goods were seized by Japanese warships and sailed to Qingdao. Later, the authorities of the respective countries sent warships to protect them, and they were able to risk returning. Afterwards, the foreign transport ships changed their routes and sailed to other routes. The navigational markers at the mouth of the Sheyang River (ie, Yanghekou) were removed by Japanese warships, and local pilots fled, making it even more difficult for ships to pass. According to a telegram from Chen Boming of the Hexing Town Ning Qinghexiang Shenzhuang yesterday, Hexing Town has been bombed repeatedly, and foreign merchant ships should not enter the port. In this situation, the Hexing route will be difficult to resume for a while. It is reported that there are no garrison troops in the area, and the Japanese bombing is just wasting ammunition.

### British Warship Escorts Merchant Ship to Safety

According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury*, according to news revealed in the local area today, the British escort ship HMS Wren, following the precedent of the British cruiser HMS Birmingham sailing from Weihaiwei to Qingdao to rescue the Yongmai, yesterday (the 8th) also sailed from Weihaiwei to Yantai because two of the Jardine Matheson's transport ships were detained. The two ships detained were the Mingsheng and Desheng. They were blocked at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday and were unable to set sail. The Desheng was released at midnight and sailed out. At noon the next day, HMS Wren arrived at Yantai from Weihaiwei and immediately ordered the Mingsheng to set sail. The ship is still docked in Yantai, and its commander is continuing to investigate the delay caused by the detention of the two ships. It is believed that the Japanese side's answer will be to inspect the passenger list of the two ships.

### Merchants from Various Industries Telegraph to Request Slowdown of Ban on Shipping Local Goods to Shanghai, Shanghai Concession Cannot Be Controlled by the Japanese, Please Give Consideration to Merchants' Difficulties During the General Termination Period

After the customs of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces were ordered to ban the shipment of 54 kinds of local goods, such as tung oil, to Shanghai, various industries telegraphed to call for relief. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on the petitions from the raw lacquer and egg industries, etc., telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, as well as the military and political authorities of Zhejiang, to allow the release of the goods. The Trade Commission was ordered to formulate measures and allocate funds to purchase the goods to avoid obstruction of local goods and affect the livelihood of farmers and merchants. The details are recorded as follows:

Obstruction of Local Goods, Telegraph Calls for Relief: Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs designated 54 kinds of goods, such as tung oil, eggs, tea, wood, casings, raw lacquer, and paper, and banned their shipment to Japan and its colonies or mandated territories, and areas controlled by Japanese violence, Shanghai, as a occupied area, the customs of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces immediately ordered a ban on shipment to Shanghai. The various industries of cotton, paper, eggs, tea, wood, etc. in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, were affected because once the ban was implemented, the goods purchased by merchants were detained by the customs in various places and were not allowed to be released. Local goods piled up in Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Fujian, and could not be shipped to Shanghai, which greatly affected the livelihood of farmers and merchants, all telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the provincial authorities, requesting consideration of the difficulties of merchants and allowing the release of the goods.

Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs to Request Release of Local Goods: The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that the commerce of Shanghai has always been concentrated in the concession area. After the National Army retreated to the west, the commerce in Nanshi and Zhabei all tried to move to the safe area of the concession to operate. After the Raw Lacquer Industry Association previously requested that the Ministry of Economic Affairs be requested to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to order the customs to release the goods to maintain the circulation of goods, it received a request from the Egg Industry Association yesterday, stating that the industry mainly focuses on retail sales and the manufacture of colored eggs, etc., and the source mainly relies on the Oujiang, Jiaojiang, and Yongjiang ports in eastern Zhejiang. Now that the government has ordered a ban on shipment to Shanghai, it is difficult to maintain business, and thousands of employees are at risk of unemployment. Please telegraph the military and political authorities of eastern Zhejiang to allow the release of fresh eggs to Shanghai.

Various Places Continue to Telegraph Request for Slowdown of Ban: Various chambers of commerce have telegraphed the government to request a slowdown of the ban. The telegram from the Yuyao Chamber of Commerce to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Customs Supervision Office stated that the Zhejiang Customs reported that the Ministry of Finance ordered that 54 kinds of products, such as cotton and tea, should be banned from export. The amount of cotton and other products produced in the county is very large and has always been supplied for export. Not only does the entire county rely on it for financing and turnover, but also the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of merchants and farmers is maintained by this. Once the ban is implemented, it will cause the entire county's commerce to stagnate and the economy to collapse. Moreover, the Shanghai Concession is still managed by the concession authorities, which is different from the prohibited areas that have been controlled by Japanese violence. The chamber believes that at the time when commerce is generally terminated, in order to maintain the financial stability of the commercial market and stabilize the morale of the rear, the ban should be slowed down to benefit the people's livelihood.

Formulate Measures and Allocate Funds to Purchase: The New Voice News reporter learned from relevant parties yesterday that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have jointly decided that after the ban on the shipment of 54 kinds of local goods, if they are local bulk products and the sales channels are blocked, affecting the people's livelihood, the Trade Commission has been ordered to order the Agricultural Bank and others to allocate funds to purchase them as much as possible. It is reported that the Zhejiang Office of the Trade Commission has entrusted the Central Trust Bureau, China Tea Company, etc. to contact various industries such as tung oil and tea to negotiate purchases, and the Trade Commission has negotiated with British-American Tobacco and Jardine Matheson to arrange for the two companies to send special ships to transport the goods to Hong Kong, where they will be concentrated and then exported.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Rewards Machine-Made Foreign Goods

Municipal Chamber of Commerce Announces Various Regulations

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently revised the procedures for manufacturers to apply for taxes on machine-made foreign-style goods in accordance with the current regulations. All machine factories in the city that have been approved for registration and use machines to imitate foreign-style goods should follow the procedures to apply for paying taxes in accordance with the current regulations for machine-made foreign-style goods. For the convenience of reference, the five procedures, together with the ten regulations for paying taxes on machine goods, and the twenty-nine articles of the Provisional Regulations on Encouraging Industrial Technology and the twenty-eight articles of the implementing rules, have been published in full in the first issue of this year's Commercial Daily.

### Large Amounts of Counterfeit Money Transported to Shanghai for Mixing and Sale, Customs Strictly Investigating, Printing Color is No Different from Genuine Money, Edge is Slightly Wider, Can Be Distinguished After Careful Inspection

The Jianghai Customs recently received a secret report that a certain party is printing a large number of counterfeit banknotes in its country to disrupt my country's finances, and is transporting them to Shanghai for mixing and sale. A small number of these counterfeit banknotes have been discovered in the market. It is reported that the printing color is exquisite and carefully researched, and there is no difference from genuine money. However, the edge of the paper is slightly larger, there is too much blank space, and the lines are also rougher. Therefore, once carefully identified, the authenticity can be detected. It is also reported that the quantity of these counterfeit banknotes that have been imported in recent days is very large. The customs authorities have ordered strict investigation and suppression to prevent them from circulating in the market and affecting the currency system. Several cases have been solved. At the same time, the banking sector has also paid attention to this.

### Japanese and Puppet Regime Again Inventing Names to Impose a "Goods Entering Tax"; Puppet Official in Hupu Embezzles Funds and Flees; Japanese Side Refuses Import of Chinese and Foreign Cotton Yarn

Within the areas they occupy, the Japanese and puppet regimes exhaust all methods to plunder the economy. The types of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies number no fewer than dozens. Recently, they have cleverly invented a new name, increasing the "Goods Entering Tax." A puppet official at the Hupu Japanese-puppet tax collection agency engaged in massive embezzlement, absconding with a huge sum. Details are reported below:

Japanese and Puppet Regime Imposes Another "Goods Entering Tax" The Japanese and puppet regime, at various river ports seized through violence, have stationed Japanese troops and puppet police to handle tax collection matters. All kinds of goods, no matter how large or small, are subject to taxes. The categories are numerous, no fewer than dozens. Ordinary merchants and people, under this oppressive duress, are crying out in misery. After the Japanese and puppet regime began levying the "Goods Exiting Tax" on December 10th of last year, only two months have passed, and it has already become unbearable for merchants. Unexpectedly, they have recently increased the "Goods Entering Tax," establishing harsh regulations to extract a percentage of the goods' value, scheduled to be implemented on the 15th of this month. This shows how the Japanese and puppet regime schemes to extort money and plunder the economy, intending to drive our people to their deaths.

Puppet Official Embezzles Funds and Flees Hupu Port is a central port for commerce after the war. The goods entering and exiting daily amount to hundreds of thousands, with daily tax revenues amounting to a substantial seven or eight thousand yuan. Therefore, the puppet organization specifically established a "Tax Collection Office" at the port, appointing Zhang Younan as "Director" to handle various tax collections. Within a few months, this puppet official and others colluded to embezzle funds, underreporting the amount collected under the "Transit Tax" category, embezzling over two hundred thousand yuan. This matter was discovered by the Japanese and puppet authorities, who immediately dispatched Japanese and puppet troops to surround the "Tax Collection Office." Unexpectedly, the puppet officials had already gotten wind of it and fled, also taking the remaining twenty thousand yuan of tax money in the iron safe when they left. All tax receipt ledgers and other counterfeit documents were set ablaze.

Chinese and Foreign Yarn Refused Import The Japanese side, aiming to monopolize the mainland cotton yarn market, has imposed strict restrictions on yarn produced by Chinese and foreign factories. Recently, the Japanese puppet regime has refused to allow any non-Japanese yarn to be unloaded at riverside ports. Earlier this month, several hundred pieces of yarn (a portion of which was Japanese yarn) were detained and have not yet been released. Therefore, various merchants and factories are jointly negotiating, while also finding ways to modify vehicles to transport goods inland.

### Passports to Yunnan via Vietnam Issued with Utmost Care

Preventing Traitors from Entering the Country

In order to strictly prevent traitors from engaging in activities and undermining the united resistance efforts in Yunnan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed the visa office in Hong Kong to carefully verify the identity and profession of Chinese citizens applying for passports to enter Yunnan via Vietnam. Particular attention should be paid to the guarantee aspect. Simultaneously, the central government has established a passenger entry inspection station in the Chinese area near Haiphong to strictly inspect passengers. Even those with passports must undergo thorough inspection before being allowed to pass. If there is any suspicion or unclear background, they must find a reliable shop in Haiphong to guarantee them before being allowed to enter the country. As for Chinese citizens going to Burma, the Burmese government has announced that all Chinese traveling to Burma, regardless of origin, must have a formal passport, and temporary certificates will no longer be recognized as valid. This formal passport can be issued by the Hong Kong Foreign Affairs Office, and according to Burmese government passport regulations, the passport holder must sign and affix a thumbprint for verification to avoid future difficulties due to non-compliance with procedures.

### "Tuo Hu" Rickshaw Association Announces: Negotiations for Improving Rickshaws; Rickshaw Pullers Begin Paying Licenses; Police Release Impounded Rickshaws; Association Expresses Gratitude to Ratepayers' Association and Chinese Directors

The Shanghai Market Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association's members' rickshaws, regarding the request for an extension to improve vehicles, has now been resolved. Various police stations have begun releasing impounded rickshaws. Rickshaws without licenses have begun paying for licenses and operating since yesterday. The Mutual Aid Association has announced the negotiation process and expressed gratitude to the Chinese directors. Details are reported separately below:

Start Paying Licenses The rickshaws of the "Tuo Hu" Rickshaw Association members, due to economic difficulties and inability to improve vehicles, have been resolved after mediation by the Public Works Department's Chinese Director Xi Yushu and others. Improvements must be completed by July 1st of this year. Rickshaw pullers have already begun paying for spring licenses at the Gordon Road verification office yesterday, based on multiple-season licenses, and redeeming impounded rickshaws from various police stations based on the paid licenses. Except for the impounded rickshaws at the Old Gate police station, which were released the night before, the remaining police stations in New Gate, Hui Shi, Jing'an Temple, etc., also began releasing impounded rickshaws yesterday.

Expressing Gratitude to Chinese Directors The Market Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association, representing member rickshaw pullers, expresses gratitude to the Public Works Department's Chinese directors and the Ratepayers' Association, saying: "We respectfully report that this time, our members' rickshaws, due to economic difficulties, were unable to comply with the Public Works Department's current regulations to immediately improve vehicles. We are grateful for your Association's (Directors) sympathy and mediation, which allowed for an extension to implement the improvements. We are extremely grateful. In addition to supervising members to proceed according to the negotiated resolution, we are sending this letter to express our gratitude. Please take note."

Negotiation Process The Shanghai Market Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association announced the negotiation process for improving vehicles, stating: "Previously, our association received reports from 'Tuo Hu' rickshaw operators that the Public Works Department's sudden order to shorten the rickshaw handles and modify the two-hour iron wheels hindered work, affected livelihoods, and made the wheel modification costs unbearable. We requested a reasonable negotiation with the Public Works Department, which was resolved by our association's letter to the Public Concession Ratepayers' Association and Public Works Department Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, and others. The solution is as follows: 1. The improvement of vehicles will be supervised by our association for all members to implement, completing the improvements by July 1st of this year. 2. Impounded vehicles will be released by the police stations upon notification by the Public Works Department. 3. Vehicles without licenses can be exempt from verification and pay for the spring license with the winter license. Our association has decided to implement the vehicle improvement plan starting March 1st. All our 'Tuo Hu' rickshaw operators, regardless of whether they have registered with our association, are requested to bring their vehicles to our association (address: 24, Lane 290, Guizhou Road, Beijing Road) for registration, so that we can compile statistics and improve them uniformly. For impoverished operators who cannot afford the cost of modifying the wheel edges, our association will provide loans. This matter concerns the vital interests of our operators. We hope you will register with our association promptly to facilitate improvements and avoid being penalized for violating regulations after the deadline."

Truth of Mediation Another report states that the Public Works Department's Chinese directors, regarding the rickshaw wheel modification case, believe that the Public Works Department's actions are based on a resolution and are not open to criticism. However, the rickshaw pullers are experiencing economic difficulties and cannot afford to modify their vehicles immediately. Therefore, during mediation, they only requested an extension to allow rickshaw pullers time to prepare. Also, before this case was resolved, Chinese Director Xi Yushu had discussed the matter with the bureau several times. The gathering of all Chinese directors for a discussion is not factual.

### British Military Commander Returning Home Tomorrow

### Renovation of Hongkou Buildings Not Yet Completed

Some Have Been Repaired

The Rest Are Being Rushed

According to a Public Works Department source, the various public works buildings in Hongkou have suffered severe damage in the war. These include the park warden's dormitory in Hongkou Park, the sanitation branch in the Huishan vegetable market, and the Public Works Department factory on Yuezhou Road, all of which have now been repaired and completed. Others, such as the Northern District sewer disposal facility, the Peng Road Chinese-Italian Elementary School, the Public and Hanbury Girls' School, and the Ward Road Prison Hospital, are still under repair.

### Gandhi, Tagore, etc., Sympathize with China's Resistance; Say China Will Certainly Win the Final Victory; All of India Is Now Striving to Boycott Japanese Goods

The Continental Daily reports that Mr. Wu and Mr. Cai (both transliterated), of the National Committee of the Chinese Youth Association, returned to Shanghai from India last week as Chinese delegates to the World Christian Conference. Yesterday (the 8th), they told reporters that India's three giants are wholeheartedly supporting China's resistance. These three are the world-renowned:

Indian Patriots Gandhi, the initiator of non-cooperation with Britain and Nehru, who served two terms as chairman of the All-India National Congress, is worshipped by at least 90% of the Indian people, and the world-renowned poet Tagore. Several Chinese delegates attending the conference visited these three leaders in December. First, they visited Gandhi in Sevagram, and then went to Santiniketan, not far from Calcutta, where Tagore established his major works.

Then They Went to Bombay to visit Nehru. Although Gandhi has always advocated moderation, he told the Chinese delegates that in special circumstances, assisting with atrocities is not necessarily a wrong thing to do. He also said that since he began working for political independence in India, he had assisted the British government, its enemy, during the war. During the Boer War in South Africa and World War I, he organized stretcher teams and first aid groups.

Serving in the British Army He does not regret this, believing that this move could win the sympathy of the British people, Gandhi is quite healthy and often lives in a small village called Ashram for recuperation. The exchange of views between the Chinese delegates and Tagore focused on cultural aspects, but Tagore also expressed sympathy for China's resistance. His attitude towards the Sino-Japanese War is clearly expressed in his letter to a Japanese poet. Tagore's letter

Says Japanese Warlords are like madmen, destroying civilization. I know that once the Japanese people wake up, they will have to rebuild their civilization. China cannot be conquered. Under the indomitable leadership of Chairman Chiang, Chinese civilization has shown its amazing development, the people's oath of allegiance, and the unprecedented spiritual unity. A new era is being established there. Temporary setbacks cannot destroy its complete

Awakened Spirit Speaking to Nehru, the Chinese delegates could see the extent of India's sympathy for China's struggle. Mr. Nehru repeatedly told the delegates that India wanted to do more for China and provide China with material assistance. India's important political party, the All-India National Congress, passed two important resolutions favorable to China: one

Was to condemn Japan's "aggression" against China, and the second was to pass a measure boycotting Japanese goods in India. The National Congress is now exerting all its efforts to implement the second resolution. Mr. Nehru sent two types of written appeals to the Chinese delegates: one a letter to the people and one a letter to Chinese students, which recalled the long history of Chinese and Indian culture and civilization, and stated the certainty of China's victory in the resistance, hoping that the Chinese and Indian people would cooperate closely.

### Famous Chinese and Foreign Journalists Receive Threatening Letters; Even "Sentencing to Death" Is Used as Intimidation; Everyone Knows the Purpose Behind This

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that a certain journalist in Shanghai has received a threatening letter from the "Most Upright and Genuine Chinese Association," stating that a large number of Chinese and foreign male and female journalists in Shanghai will be put to death. The letter stated that they have all been "sentenced to death" and the recipient of the letter is one of them. Whether this is a prank is unknown. If it is a prank, then it is an extremely clumsy one. Otherwise, this is a particularly serious matter. The Public Concession Police Department is currently investigating. Among those threatened is Mr. Alcott, a reporter for the Greater Shanghai Radio Station, whose offense is described as "lying as much as possible twice a day." Mr. Gault and Mr. Ford of the Greater Shanghai Evening Post "lie every day," Mr. Powell and Mr. Gui Zhongshu of the China Weekly Review, "lie once a week," Miss Smedley, Mr. Tilman and Mr. Farnsworth "write books full of lies," and Mr. Fei Shi "runs Chinese newspapers full of lies." The letter lists a total of thirteen people, one of whom is the owner of the Commercial Press and several other Chinese people. In short, the intimidators have compiled a list of those who publish news and opinions sympathetic to China. This kind of news and opinion is clearly not in line with the political views of the "Upright Chinese," or perhaps these people are not human, or perhaps these people can be identified as the New Asia Hotel terrorists who disturbed Shanghai's security last year.

### American Warship Monocacy Sinks in Chinese Waters; Decommissioned Due to Old Age

The Continental Daily reports that the old gunboat Monocacy of the U.S. Navy's Yangtze River Patrol will be sunk in Chinese waters today (the 9th) due to old age. At approximately 10:00 this morning, the ship, carrying Navy Lieutenant Commander Ranna and two sailors, was towed to the deep sea off Ma'anshan Island. Ranna and the two sailors entered the bottom of the ship, opened the drain pipes and suction valves, and then left the ship and entered the tugboat, allowing the turbid waters of the Chinese sea to pour into the ship. It is expected that the Monocacy will sink within minutes. Two other old American ships, the Villalobos and the Quiros, which served in the Far East for many years, are also anchored in the sea nearby and will also be sunk in Chinese waters. The Monocacy was built in San Francisco Bay in 1914 and then sailed to Shanghai to be assigned to the U.S. Navy, serving in various rivers of China for 24 years. Monocacy is the name of an American river, and the warship now being sunk is the second American ship to bear this name.

### Assessing Commodity Prices; Suppressing Speculation

Price Assessment Associations Established Everywhere

Strictly Prohibiting Merchants and People from Raising Prices and Taking Advantage

After the Ministry of Economic Affairs formulated measures for assessing commodity prices and suppressing speculation and manipulation in extraordinary times, provinces, cities, and counties were ordered to organize price assessment committees, stipulating that all commodities within their jurisdiction must be sold in accordance with the assessed prices in order to stabilize commodity prices and people's livelihoods. Now Zhejiang Province and other places have found that a few cunning merchants, blinded by greed, disregard everything else, and often violate the assessed prices of the Price Assessment Committee in covert ways, selling inferior goods at high prices and taking advantage for profit. The unscrupulous merchants are truly insufficient, and the common people suffer greatly. This kind of exploitation is truly heartbreaking. In addition to sending personnel to secretly investigate from time to time, the prefectural government also ordered various counties to instruct police stations, offices, and township public offices to pay close attention. If various shops are found to be taking advantage for profit and violating the assessed price situation again, they should be reported to the prefectural government immediately for severe punishment. This matter concerns the people's livelihood and should not be tolerated.

### The Saving and Rescue Association Advocates: Frugal New Year

Changzhou Fellow-Countrymen Association to Hold

Radio Broadcast to Solicit Clothes and Rice for Refugees

The Municipal Saving and Rescue Committee received a letter from a member of the Hualian Amusement Association yesterday, implementing a savings of forty yuan in New Year's expenses to help refugees, and requesting promotion and guidance to achieve significant results. The committee has already responded with approval.

Furthermore, the Changzhou Fellow-Countrymen Association, in view of the extreme suffering of the refugees, remitted more than a thousand yuan and 1,600 pieces of cotton clothing the day before yesterday for distribution in Changzhou. However, there is a shortage of aid, and it is difficult to provide relief. It is reported that on the 11th and 12th of this month, they will invite famous opera singers Cheng Junmou, the Bao brothers, Jiang Junjia, Xie Wenyuan, Xie Kui, Chen Xiaodie, Gong Zhaoxiong, Yuan Senzhai, Zhao Peixin, Sun Lanting, Sun Junqing, Wang Yiqiu, Mao Jiahua, Xu Qinfang, and over a hundred others to broadcast a special program at the Hua Ying Radio Station to solicit clothes and rice for the refugees. It is especially hoped that philanthropists and fellow-countrymen in Shanghai will donate generously to support this good cause.

### Central Machinery Factory: New Factory Buildings

Imitating American-Style Yarn Steel Spindles

Already Popular in the National Spinning Industry

It has been many years since China's textile industry adopted European and American machinery and established factories for self-spinning. However, since there were no domestic manufacturers of machinery, it was always purchased from foreign countries, resulting in huge annual foreign exchange losses. Now, Mr. Fan, the founder of the Shanghai Central Machinery Manufacturing Factory in Shanghai, recognized this and has been studying various spindle winding machines and other machine parts for six years. He built a workshop and established a factory in Yu. However, due to the August 13th Incident two years ago, he temporarily moved to 262 Avenue Road in the Public Concession to continue his manufacturing work to meet the needs of major yarn factories in this city and other places. After a detailed investigation by reporters, it was learned that the factory produces high-speed winding machines imitating the American-style (Ning Fan Yiner) and various ball fine yarn steel spindles. Recently, it has also produced large drafts and various thick and thin rollers. Their exquisite craftsmanship and low prices have long been favored by major yarn factories. It is said that the total output for the entire year last year, with spindles alone totaling more than 100,000, was all ordered by factories such as the Shanghai Shenxin No. 9 Factory, Shenxin No. 2 Factory, Dasheng No. 1 Factory, Xinhe, Xinsheng, and the Xi'an Dahua Factory in other places. Recently, the British company Xin Chang Yangxing's Zhongfang Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory has also ordered 20,000 spindles, showing that the factory's products have been recognized by foreign merchants, which is truly commendable. This will not only reduce foreign exchange losses and revive national power, but also add glory to China's machinery manufacturing industry. Now, because the original workshop is insufficient to accommodate the work, the factory has purchased land on West Factory Road and Wuding Road to build new buildings in order to increase work efficiency and further improve product quality. It is reported that the entire project will be completed next month and will be moved in immediately.

### Relief Association Education Group Implements Refugee Education Promotion; Forcing All School-Age Refugee Children to Attend School; Eradicating Illiteracy Among Those Under Forty

The Education Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held its second Education Committee meeting the day before yesterday, and the following matters were resolved: 1. On the proposal to unify refugee education administration, it was resolved that since refugees' livelihoods are provided by the Association, educational facilities should also be planned by the Association as a whole to achieve uniformity and facilitate progress. Zhao Puchu, Xia Huanxin, and Zhao Chuanjia were elected as members to draft a unified plan for education in all Shanghai shelters, and after review by Cai Renbao, Chen Jicheng, and Yao Siguo, the plan will be submitted to the secretariat for forwarding to the council for approval. 2. On the implementation of the in-service training program for physical education teachers, it was resolved that the principles of the various articles proposed by Wang Fuqie be approved in general. 3. On the review and implementation of the measures for compulsory literacy for adults and school enrollment for children, it was resolved that Zhao Puchu review the compulsory adult literacy case, and the compulsory school enrollment for children be approved in principle. 4. On the proposal to unify the curriculum content for children's education in various shelters, it was resolved to handle it jointly with the proposal to unify refugee youth administration. 5. On how to implement the central supervision district system, it was resolved to implement it according to the previously drafted principles, taking the situation into account. 6. On the review of the education plan for refugee children in the Dunxin Road New Shelter, it was resolved that the principles of the original plan be approved and submitted to the secretariat for forwarding to the Association for approval. 7. On how to stipulate the work of teachers in various shelters, it was resolved to merge it with the first case and formulate and implement it together. 8. On how to train teachers, it was resolved to formulate and implement it together with the first case. The following are excerpts of the important measures:

Compulsory School Enrollment All children in this shelter, both male and female, aged six to sixteen (actual age), must attend the seven-grade children's education class. Children of school age with illnesses or other defects may temporarily postpone school, but they must report to the person in charge and provide a doctor's certificate to be valid. For school-age children who do not report to class, the shelter director and education director must conduct persuasion and order them to attend school. Those who deliberately evade or are truant may be warned. If they still refuse to attend school after three warnings, they may be punished with termination of shelter. School-age children in each shelter who need to leave the shelter for work must report to the shelter's education director and register for reference when grading. Facilitation will be provided to the extent possible, but if it is not possible to facilitate them, they must work after attending classes. The standard number of students in each class is forty. It may be increased or decreased depending on the classroom conditions.

Eradicating Illiteracy All illiterate men and women in each shelter aged sixteen to forty, except for those who are ill or disabled who may postpone learning, must receive four months of literacy education, regardless of whether they are employed or not. The shelter director should compile a list of adults in their shelter who should be educated but have not been, and report it to the group, and form several classes, schedule education times and locations, and attend classes in turn. Once adults in each shelter have been assigned to a class and started classes, they must attend classes on time and must not make excuses for absence, except for special circumstances for which they may ask for leave. If they intentionally skip school, they will be given appropriate punishment once it is verified. Each class should have at least forty students, with at least one class per day, each class lasting sixty minutes. During class time, in addition to literacy, there should also be interspersed lectures on common knowledge such as civic hygiene, history, geography, and nature. The Literacy Textbook will use the "Common People's Thousand-Character Textbook," with one volume completed each month and a test held once. This will be conducted by the shelter directors. At the end of the four-month course, the group will conduct a general test once, and those who pass will be given a literacy certificate.

Literacy Education All administrative and teaching staff in the shelter are members of the Adult Literacy Promotion Group, with the shelter director as the head of the group and the education director as the deputy head of the group. Each member should select ten "little teachers" from the shelter who are over twelve years old and have completed the fifth or sixth grade of elementary school to organize a literacy promotion team. The tasks of the little teachers are as follows: Each teacher must be responsible for guiding two to five illiterate people. Reviewing the literacy lessons already learned by adults. Guiding practice in writing, reading newspapers, and other reading materials. Examining the literacy situation of adults. Assisting the class teacher and urging illiterate people to attend classes. Those little teachers who are excellent in their studies and are trusted by the general illiterate people when teaching may be promoted to assistant teachers and formally teach the illiterate.

In-Service Training Measures for Physical Education Teachers Each shelter must designate one or several people to be responsible for physical education. The physical education staff designated by each shelter must attend the designated location and receive guidance in accordance with the in-service training measures. The training period is tentatively set for four weeks, once a week, with one hour in the outdoor field and one hour indoors.

The rice market of the Bean and Rice Industry Association has decided to close the market and stop metering on the 14th of this month, as the general closing is approaching, and to handle the settlement of transactions between industry brokers starting on the 16th. This has been publicly announced in the market. It has been learned that in order to thoroughly rectify and eliminate bad habits in the rice market, it has been decided that the settlement period for broker transactions must be completed before the 16th of this month.

Totaling Over 780,000 Yuan

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has released its first cash income and expenditure report, stating that the association was officially established on October 18th, the 27th year of the Republic [1938]. Actual work, such as entrusting banks and firms to collect donations, distributing living expenses to refugee camps affiliated with various charitable organizations, and making various payments, began on November 1st. Now, the cash income and expenditure accounts for the three months of November 12th, 27th year of the Republic [1938], and January of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], have been compiled into a report and approved by the board of directors on [blank] day of this month. It is hereby announced to the public. This announcement consists of three tables: the first table is a summary report of cash income and expenditure, the second table is a detailed table of subsidies for living expenses, and the third table is a detailed table of administrative expenses. Finally, the following explanations are added: The total donation income is 786,497.99 yuan. Expenditure on operating expenses: (A) Subsidies for living expenses to various charitable organizations, totaling 254,263.07 yuan; (B) Subsidies for construction costs of the Dunxin Road Refugee Camp, 50,000 yuan; (C) Medical and educational expenses totaling 13,434.37 yuan. Fundraising expenses (including collection and reporting, thank-you advertisements, donation receipts, notices, and expenses for various trade associations and organizations that collect donations on behalf of the association) totaled 12,845.77 yuan. Expenditures were lower in the first month, but exceeded 5,000 yuan in the second and third months, but donation income was also considerable. Administrative expenses totaled 13,013.96 yuan, with an average monthly expenditure of over 4,000 yuan. This covers the salaries of the association's staff and workers. The (Chairman), Vice-Chairman, Director-General, Deputy Director-General, heads of various departments, Treasurer, and Director of the Accounting Department all serve on a voluntary basis, do not receive salaries, and do not receive any allowances. Initial setup costs were the various expenses incurred during the initial preparation and establishment in the first month, with public notices, printing, and donation receipts being the largest items. Starting in the second month, additional printing was done as fundraising expenses (including the purchase of equipment, estimated at 1,000 yuan). Furthermore, 100,000 yuan each was allocated for living expense reserves and post-disaster reserves, which was approved by the board of directors and stored in special accounts. Temporary payments made include 17,085.22 yuan temporarily borrowed by the Nanshi Refugee Area, 10,000 yuan temporarily borrowed by the Cilian Branch, and the remaining 200 yuan for unreimbursed travel expenses. The association's first month's donation income was remitted in the amount of 100,000 yuan. The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China provided free currency exchange. The remaining balance from January was also exchanged for 50,000 yuan by the four banks. This report is appended as an acknowledgment of thanks. Furthermore, since the establishment of the association, it has received enthusiastic donations from all sectors of society. The association's members are deeply grateful for the balance remaining up to January of the 28th year of the Republic [1939]. However, with the prolonged period of providing living expenses and post-disaster assistance, and the vast amount of work involved, substantial funds will be required. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will continue to provide a steady stream of support to prevent any shortages. We earnestly pray for this.

### Rare Case of Anthrax Discovered in Isolation Hospital

Infected by Unsterilized Animal Hair

Jewish Man Dies Despite Treatment

On Tuesday of this week, a Russian Jewish man named Pei Lunji died of anthrax at the Public Concession Isolation Hospital. This disease has not been seen in Shanghai for several years, and has therefore attracted attention from all sides. Anthrax, also known as malignant pustule, is a dreaded skin disease, generally transmitted by unsterilized animal hair. Two days before his death, Pei used a newly purchased shaving brush while shaving. He accidentally cut his skin, and that afternoon, he felt dizzy. Although he went to the hospital for treatment immediately, he could not be saved. Local medical experts believe that the disease originated from the brush he purchased, which was likely made from the hair of a diseased animal and had not been properly sterilized, leading to the infection. Anthrax is originally a disease of animals, especially cattle and sheep, but humans can also be infected through inoculation. Patients develop skin ulcers, and the spleen also enlarges, eventually leading to exhaustion and death. Three years ago, a young Russian artist in Shanghai died from this disease.

### Two Types of Government Bonds to be Redeemed by Lottery Today

In order to maintain the credibility of government bonds, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the National Debt Fund Management Committee to continue to hold lotteries for the principal and interest of all domestic debts that are due.

### Taishan Opera Troupe Raises Funds Through Radio Broadcast and Performances

To Relief Shanghai and Guangdong Refugees

Inviting Ms. Li Xuefang to Join

In order to promote the relief movement for refugees in Shanghai and Guangdong, the Taishan Opera Troupe will broadcast famous songs and raise donations at the Xinxin Company radio station. On this day (the 10th) from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM, all the performers will jointly perform. It is reported that famous Cantonese opera stars from Guangdong, including Hua Lisi, Luo Jiaquan, Wen Huamei, Gui Mingyang, and Liang Yintang, have been specially invited to broadcast special programs, which can be described as a gathering of talents, adding to the splendor. Charitable individuals from all walks of life are welcome to enthusiastically request songs.

Also, Cantonese people in Shanghai previously organized the Guangdong Refugee Relief Committee to relieve refugees in Guangdong and have begun fundraising, with satisfactory results. It is reported that the committee, recognizing the suffering of their fellow villagers in Guangdong, has specially invited renowned Cantonese opera artists Ms. Li Xuefang, Gui Mingyang, Luo Jiaquan, and others to join the Taishan Opera Troupe to perform charitable performances to assist in disaster relief. The dates are the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th, a total of four days. The location is the Gengxin Theater. Ticket prices are divided into ten yuan, five yuan, two yuan, and four jiao, with all proceeds being donated to Shanghai refugees, and another portion being donated to Guangdong compatriots. According to Mr. Li Zeyun, the person in charge of the committee and the general manager of Xinxin Company, Ms. Li Xuefang is known as the "Queen of Cantonese Opera," with a reputation similar to that of Mei Lanfang in the north and Li Xuefang in the south, and has retired from the stage for many years. This time, due to the urgent need to relieve refugees, she has resolutely made an exception to perform, which is truly commendable.

### Renters in Ren Zhi and Tong De Lanes Petition Housing Association

The Joint Association of Renters in Ren Zhi Lane on North Sichuan Road and Tong De Lane on East Wuchang Road has previously reported that they have stated their reasons for requesting the landlord, old Sassoon, to postpone rent increases. It is now reported that the association yesterday sent representatives to petition the Housing Problem Committee of the Shanghai Special District, and submitted a petition stating that when the tenants paid the old rent, the landlord’s accounting office solemnly declared that the new rent would only be paid after the area was declared open. Now, the landlord is forcing the tenants to pay the rent, which the tenants find difficult to accept. Repeated negotiations have been fruitless due to the landlord's lack of sincerity. They request the committee to investigate and provide assistance so that the rent can be calculated from the date of opening, in order to achieve fairness. Yang Yifen was appointed as a representative to petition. After the resident member of the committee inquired about the details of the entire situation, they agreed to forward a letter to the landlord, requesting them to understand the difficult times and make concessions.

### Japanese Soldier in Sijing Town, Western Shanghai, Hangs Himself Due to War-Weariness Two Japanese Soldiers Demolishing Houses to Build Forts Crushed to Death

After 80 Japanese soldiers suddenly arrived in Sijing Town, western Shanghai, on the 6th of this month, they stationed themselves in the Hetae Lumber Company and the houses of the Ma family from Henan. They are currently demolishing civilian houses there to build forts, attempting to defend the area for a long time. They are also extorting merchants in the town, demanding a monthly payment of 10,000 yuan as military supplies. As a result, merchants have closed their shops in droves. While the Japanese soldiers were demolishing civilian houses, two soldiers were crushed to death when a house collapsed. In addition, one Japanese soldier hanged himself on the morning of the 7th due to war-weariness.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Report for January

According to the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in January of this year, 314 small-scale factories and 25 medium-scale factories were opened in the concession (including roads outside the concession). 62 factories were located north of the Suzhou Creek, and 162 factories were located in the West, Central, and North districts. 115 factories were located on roads outside the West district. 178 newly established factories were inspected, employing a total of 6,087 workers. No new large factories applied for building permits during the past month, but several small-scale factories intended to expand. New factories planned to be established outside the concession include one rubber factory and four seasoning powder factories. The factory owners have been given various instructions by the Industrial Section to avoid disturbing neighbors and to ensure the safety of workers.

(Steam Pressure Machinery) Eighteen petitions were received for the registration of boilers and other steam pressure machinery. In addition, 29 boilers are currently being inspected by experts. Fifteen valid inspection certificates were received for the next twelve months. 44 boilers have not been inspected, and the Industrial Section has ordered their owners to promptly apply for inspection procedures. The fourth training class for boiler operators ended on January 10th. On the 23rd of the same month, 44 people in the class received certificates. Boiler operators who have been trained in the past have decided to meet every two weeks to maintain contact with the Industrial Section and maintain a good level of work. The first training class of this year started on January 31st, with 40 trainees.

(Accidents) A total of 124 industrial and occupational accidents were reported to the Industrial Section, including nine fatal accidents. The workers who died were one each from the carpentry, glass, leather tanning, paper, and transportation industries, and two each from the machinery and hardware, and textile industries. Among the injured workers, 27 were in the transportation industry, 25 in the textile industry, and 14 in the machinery industry. Classified by cause, accidents caused by machinery were the most frequent, with a total of 43 cases, including two fatal cases. Accidents caused by electricity accounted for four cases, including one fatal case. Accidents caused by molten metal accounted for two cases, including one fatal case. 23 workers were injured from falls, with two deaths. 14 people were injured by falling objects, with two deaths. After the accidents, the Industrial Section ordered the factories to adopt preventive measures in a total of 55 cases.

(Factory Fires) A total of 19 fires occurred in factories or related to factory operations (two in the woodworking industry, one in the furniture industry, one in the hardware industry, one in the machinery industry, one in the vehicle manufacturing industry, one in the tile and glass industry, two in the road construction industry, one in the chemical industry, four in the textile industry, one in the clothing industry, two in the food industry, two in the printing and paper industry). In addition, there was one case that did not occur in a factory, but the cause was related to liquids used in the paint industry. There were ten victims. Volatile oils used in various industries are prone to explosion and can easily catch fire, which is very dangerous in crowded workplaces. Some factories use low-quality pumps, which are also prone to accidents. The Industrial Section and the Fire Chief are jointly studying how to control these dangerous substances.

(Labor Disputes) In December of last year, the Industrial Section accepted a labor dispute case at the Commercial Press. The employees of the press made four demands, one of which was to restore pre-war salaries. After investigating the facts, the Industrial Section calculated the real wages of the employees and explained it to the press, hoping that the press could find a way to adjust the wages. The Shanghai manager of the press sent the figures provided by the Industrial Section to Hong Kong for review by the general manager. The general manager replied, stating that the company's business has been declining in the past three years, and this year will be even worse. The current wages paid by the press are 72% of what was paid before, but this year's business is only 43% of the pre-war business in 1936. The company has not laid off employees, so it has to reduce wages across the board. After this letter was forwarded to the employees, three employees have left for Hong Kong. (To be continued)

### Gunmen on Avenue Road Repeatedly Involved in Murder Cases Proved to be Involved in the Killing of Geng Shoubao After Examination of Shell Casings

Situation in Western Shanghai May Take a Turn for the Worse

According to the English-language "China Press," yesterday (the 8th) afternoon, thugs fired repeatedly on Avenue Road, leaving behind seventeen shell casings. After examination by ballistics experts from the Public Concession Police, it was discovered that the guns used by the thugs had been used in many previous cases. One of them had been used in no less than thirteen cases, and two others had been used in five and four cases, respectively. The murderers who shot and killed Geng Shoubao, the leader of the pseudo-detective team, in a gambling den on Connaught Road on Wednesday morning, used these three guns. One of them was used by thugs to shoot a Western police officer from the Jing'an Temple Police Station last December while the officer was riding a motorcycle on Brennan Road. Another one was used by thugs to fire warning shots on Brennan Road and rob two Chinese police officers of two automatic pistols. Of the four criminals who escaped from the prison in Fahua Town that was run by Japanese forces after they were arrested by the Public Concession Police, two had been identified by Chinese police officers as the thugs who robbed the pistols on Brennan Road. It is widely believed that the ten or eleven thugs who opened fire on Avenue Road yesterday included the four escaped criminals. Moreover, the shell casings proved that they were not only related to the above-mentioned cases, but also to many other cases since August of last year. Now these thugs are becoming increasingly bold, and crimes such as gambling are rampant on the roads outside the concession. Therefore, based on the current situation, the situation may take a turn for the worse. However, it is rumored that the Japanese will instruct the puppet regime to take stronger direct measures to curb gambling dens and close all 23 of them within three or four days. According to unconfirmed reports, after the gambling dens are closed, only six of them will be allowed to reopen, with the type of gambling to be determined by the Japanese and strictly managed.

The Victim's Family Files a Lawsuit for Damages

Gong Yinchu, a 29-year-old bargeman from Chongming, guaranteed a gambling debt of 40 yuan owed by his partner Chen Yalang to Gu Xiuhua, who was also in the same business. Because the debt was overdue, Gu Xiuhua and Sun Miaolin (30 years old, from Chongming) went to Room 40 of the Chunjiang Second Inn on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession at 4:00 PM on November 30 of last year to demand payment from Chen. However, Chen was out on business, and only the guarantor Gong Yinchu was in the room. Gu and Sun started arguing with Gong about the debt, which led to a quarrel. The quarrel escalated from inside the room to the stairway outside the room, resulting in a physical fight. Gong pushed Sun Miaolin, who fell down the stairs, causing internal injuries. Sun was sent to the hospital for treatment, but died at 7:00 PM that afternoon. The victim's family reported the incident to the French Police Station, and Gong was arrested. Sun's body was sent to the mortuary for examination. The autopsy confirmed that Sun died from injuries sustained in the fall. The police sent Gong to the Second Special Court for prosecution according to the law. After the trial was concluded, Gong was sentenced to imprisonment. He is now appealing to the Third Branch Court. The defendant is being held in the detention center. The deceased's adopted father, Sun Wangzhi, has hired lawyer Shi Qinghua to file a lawsuit with the civil court of the Second Special Court against Gong Yinchu for damages. The court, according to the complaint, held a hearing in Civil Court 7 yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Ma Yishu.

### Shooting in the Billiard Room of the Dadong Hotel Japanese Men Quarrel While Playing Billiards and Brandish Guns Fortunately, No One Was Injured

A gunshot was heard in the billiard room on the ground floor of the Dadong Hotel on Yinghua Street at about 2:40 PM yesterday. At the time, there were conflicting reports, and there were rumors that someone was injured. However, these were completely untrue. At the time, one of the billiard tables in the middle of the Dadong billiard room was occupied by four or five middle-aged men who resembled Japanese. They were constantly bickering with each other. One of the men, however, was too unskilled, losing repeatedly, and became angry out of shame. He suddenly quarreled with his companions, who retorted. This caused the man to fly into a rage, and he took out a pistol from his pocket, intending to intimidate the others. However, he accidentally touched the trigger, and a bullet was discharged. Fortunately, the muzzle was pointed downwards and did not injure anyone nearby. However, the gunshot startled many bystanders, and it was learned that the man who drew the gun had been grazed by the bullet. He was persuaded by his companions and left. By the time the police arrived after hearing the news to investigate, they were all gone. No one reported the incident to the police station afterwards, and no one with gunshot wounds sought treatment at the hospital. However, the police authorities are still investigating the matter to ascertain the facts.

### The Great Power of Religion Convinces Thief to Confess Gu Xueren, Who Robbed a Woman's Wallet, Realized His Wrongdoings After Hearing a Pastor's Sermon

On the night of the 4th of this month at 10:20 PM, Gao Guiying and two female companions were at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chengdu Road when a thug suddenly came forward and robbed Gao of her wallet, worth eight yuan, and fled into Lane 1462 nearby. At the time, Gao and her companions chased after him themselves. Soon after, a man came out of the lane and was identified as the robber. The police were called, and the man was taken to the police station. After investigation, it was found that he was not involved and was released. However, at 7:50 PM the night before last, Gu Xueren (32 years old), a man from Pudong, voluntarily surrendered to the Chengdu Road Police Station, saying that he had robbed a woman of her wallet on Avenue Edward VII on February 4 and had already pawned it. The police chief ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, prosecuted him according to Article 325 of the Criminal Law and stated that the defendant had voluntarily surrendered to the police station. Because the stolen goods have not been recovered and the plaintiff has not been found, he requested a postponement. When questioned, Gu Xueren confessed to the robbery. When the judge asked him why he had voluntarily surrendered to the police station, Gu said that yesterday he was passing by the church on Jing'an Temple Road when he happened to hear Mr. Shen preaching, saying that if a person has done something wrong, he should quickly confess in order to avoid disaster and receive blessings. Upon hearing these words, he realized his wrongdoings and surrendered to the police station. The judge ordered that Gu be detained and postponed the hearing to the 14th.

### Youth Exhausted and Destitute, Forging Documents to Defraud, Attempting to Defraud the Palm Company of Five Hundred Dollars, Two Arrested and Sentenced to Imprisonment

The Shanghai Palm Company, located at 51 Guangdong Road, Room 311, specializing in Palm soap and other cosmetics, with Ma Bole as the manager, also has a distribution office in Hong Kong, with Cantonese Lin Peng as the agent. Due to business relations, Lin often comes to Shanghai to meet with Ma to discuss business. On the morning of the 8th, Ma

Suddenly Received a Phone Call, according to the person on the other end, he was entrusted by Lin Peng to notify that Lin had already arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong. Due to urgent needs, he planned to temporarily borrow 500 legal tender. Ma then asked Lin to answer the phone himself, but the person on the other end said that Lin was currently out, but had already prepared a letter, and would send someone to collect the money. The conversation ended there. At 4 pm, a youth came with a letter from Lin to see Ma Bole. According to the youth, he was

Lin Ming's Nephew. Ma looked at the letterhead, which was from the East Asia Hotel. He asked when Lin Peng had arrived in Shanghai. The youth replied that he arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 6th on the Taiyuan ship. However, just recently, Ma had received a handwritten letter from Lin from Hong Kong via the Taiyuan ship, which clearly showed that Lin had not left Hong Kong to come to Shanghai. Moreover, the Taiyuan ship only arrived in Shanghai at 7 am on the 7th, so how could Lin have arrived in Shanghai on the 6th? Therefore, he called

The East Asia Hotel (because Lin always stays at that hotel when he comes to Shanghai) to inquire. He was told that Lin had not checked into the hotel. Ma then realized that the person was definitely a swindler. He immediately reported to the General Patrol Room. Chinese Detective Cheng Renkun rushed to the scene and arrested the youth. Upon questioning, his name was Lu Xuchu, a Cantonese, 21 years old. Just as he was about to be taken back to the patrol room, a Cantonese named Lin Minji stepped forward to obstruct him. He was also taken back to the patrol room. Under investigation, according to Lin, he was indeed Lin Peng's nephew. Now, because he was

Extremely Bored and Destitute, he conspired with Lu to defraud 500 dollars. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court, Criminal Division One. The patrol room lawyer Ru Baozang prosecuted them for forgery and fraud under Articles 210, 217, and 339 of the Criminal Law. After questioning the facts by Judge Feng Shide, he sentenced Lu and Lin to four months of imprisonment each as a warning.

They ordered them to hand over their gold jewelry and cash. When they refused, the bandits beat Xing with gun handles and firewood. Seeing this, her mother knelt down and begged, and gave the bandits a small gold coil worth more than ten dollars and seven dollars and fifty cents in cash from her pillow before they stopped beating her. Then they proceeded to search and plunder, taking all the cotton-padded men's and women's clothing, more than twenty pieces, five broken cotton waddings, three silver rings, a gold-plated ring, two cotton mattresses, etc. In addition, they put two baskets of rice cakes just brought from Ningbo and more than six dou of white rice into hemp sacks, and carried the stolen goods away.

If other personnel at Oxford University can also raise the same or a larger amount of cash or goods, Oxford University stated that it is willing to engage in the collection and supply of detailed methods for books, instruments, cash, and foreign teachers. This assistance is completely based on cultural sympathy and has no political, economic, or religious effect.

It is reported that after receiving this letter, the Wartime Book Collection Committee, in addition to immediately replying to express its gratitude, has first asked the four regions of Kunming, Chongqing, Chengdu, and Nanzheng to list the books they most need, so as to forward them to Oxford University.

### Sports Field Equipment Becomes a Problem: Schools Discuss Cooperative Borrowing

Those with sports fields should open them for borrowing with reasonable fees, but not too high.

Since August 13th in this city, the population has surged, and the number of young people seeking education has also increased. As a result, the number of schools is even more developed than before the war. However, due to the scarcity of buildings, the equipment in most schools is simple and crude. Moreover, many schools have been affected by the war and have relocated to Shanghai from the war zone, suffering losses that are difficult to recover. Therefore, it is particularly difficult to replenish equipment. School principals once gathered to exchange opinions and seek ways of mutual assistance and cooperation. In addition to scientific experiments, there are already two institutions established, the Natural Science Experiment Institute and the Science Experiment Institute, which can be used by students from various schools. Many libraries can also be opened for public reading, so there is no problem. However, the equipment for sports fields is the most difficult to obtain, especially for sports schools. Therefore, after exchanging opinions, the school principals plan to request schools with sports field equipment to open them for borrowing to other schools, so that schools without sports field equipment in the vicinity can arrange time to practice sports and pay reasonable fees, but not too high.

National Medicine and Diet

### Daily Foods for Patients with Scrofula

— Song Zhaorong

The following items are proven to be effective for patients with scrofula, which is in line with medical principles. They can be eaten as daily food, which is beneficial and harmless, so you might as well give them a try.

Taro: It is an extremely nutritious product. After steaming or boiling, eat two or three before each meal, long-term use is sure to have a miraculous effect. According to research, this thing contains a large amount of calcium, which is of great help in the treatment of scrofula.

Prunella vulgaris tea: Prunella vulgaris has the effect of dispelling nodules, resolving toxins, resolving phlegm, removing blood stasis, relieving heat, and clearing dampness. It is often used in medicine and is peaceful and effective. If you use it to decoct soup instead of tea in summer, it has a fragrant smell and is not very bitter. It can both refresh the stomach and relieve heat, and can also cure scrofula. It can be said to kill two birds with one stone. Even if it is not summer, it is also possible.

Water chestnut: It can eliminate food and resolve phlegm. It is also very beneficial for patients with scrofula to eat it. However, this thing grows in paddy fields and is cold in nature. Children with weak spleen and stomach are prone to umbilical pain if they eat too much, so they should not be allowed to eat it at will. This is also something that cannot be ignored.

Seaweed, kelp, jellyfish, etc.: All of the above products are salty in taste. Because they are algae, they are rich in iodine and are very effective in treating scrofula.

### Longan Paste

— He Lisan

Longan, also known as dragon eye. It tastes sweet and is slightly warm in nature. It functions to nourish blood and nourish yin, and benefit the heart and kidneys. Some people take it raw, while others take it by decoction. However, it is better to take it by decoction: The method of making soup is to first peel off a certain amount of longan pulp, add codonopsis and astragalus, (or you can add ginseng whiskers, and if yin is deficient and body fluids are insufficient, add two or three cents of American ginseng.) Place in a covered bowl, seal with paper, pierce holes, and put it in a rice pot for about ten steaming sessions. When serving, take a certain amount, add boiling water to decoct, boil thoroughly and serve. Its taste is sweet but not greasy. Longan itself is rich in nutrition, and with the help of codonopsis and astragalus, it complements each other and can greatly replenish qi and blood and strengthen the spleen and stomach. It is suitable for men and women with weak constitutions.

### Leucorrhea Aid Treatment

— Ding Jianhou

Eight or nine out of ten women suffer from leucorrhea. Now I have a prescription that is easy to treat and very effective. You can buy lotus seeds and gorgon fruit from various southern goods stores, no matter how much, steam and cook them very thoroughly, and add a little rock sugar when eating. Lotus seeds and gorgon fruit are both sweet and neutral in nature. Lotus seeds can clear the phase fire and consolidate the kidney. Gorgon fruit can tonify the spleen, treat leucorrhea, and benefit the kidneys and treat leakage. When used together, they cultivate the spleen and kidneys, clear the phase fire, and astringe the essence gate. They are truly wonderful products for treating leucorrhea. However, you must take it often to be effective.

### Eel and Pulmonary Tuberculosis

— Zhang Zanchen

The method of treating consumption is nothing more than enhancing the defensive function of its tissues to achieve the purpose of healing. But to achieve this goal, you must first make sure that you are adequately nourished. Those suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis can cook eel every week, dip it in soy sauce and serve it as a side dish, which is most suitable. Eel is rich in fatty nutrients, so it can treat pulmonary tuberculosis, sores, fistulas, and scrofula. Regular consumption is very beneficial. People only know that cod liver oil is a nourishing product for treating pulmonary tuberculosis, but they do not know that eel is actually better than cod liver oil. However, eel meat is fatty, thick and sticky, so you should first assess the digestive power of its intestines and stomach as a measure, and advance the amount according to circumstances. It is better to eat less and eat frequently, do not eat too much at once, so as not to harm the food. Otherwise, if this sticky product is temporarily input into the stomach and intestines, it will not only fail to digest it completely, but will also damage its function and cause symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, which must be paid attention to.

### Changes in the Condition of Typhoid Fever and the Dietary Program (6)

— Chen Cunren

The previous article talked about the drinks and food for typhoid fever when the chills and fever have not subsided. After the chills and fever have subsided, the inflammation in the intestines has subsided, and the digestive function can gradually function. At this time, food is needed to supply consumption, which is obviously different from the situation when the chills and fever have not subsided.

A. The first to fourth day after the initial retreat of cold and heat. The food is about five kinds: rice porridge, lotus root powder, oatmeal soup, rice noodles, and Cantonese people can eat osmanthus powder soup.

There are about eight kinds of drinks: barley tea, Job's tears tea, mulberry sprout tea, black tea, green tea, milk, soy milk, tofu flower, reed root tea, and those who have been sick for a long time and whose tongues are red and consume Yin fluid can drink American ginseng and dendrobium tea.

There are about six kinds of side dishes: sweet pickles (spit out the residue), Yunnan mustard tuber (spit out the residue), cream, jellyfish, sesame paste, and tofu mixed with green salt.

There are about five kinds of fruits: oranges, Xinhui oranges, water chestnuts, olives, and pears. There are very few side dishes that can be selected within four days after the initial retreat of cold and heat. When the cold and heat have just subsided, the body needs food to replenish consumption, and after a long period of starvation, it makes people eat exceptionally. After lying down for a long time, once the disease is initially released, the only consumption and comfort is diet. Therefore, it is as if the thirsty are seeking food, and the appetite is extremely strong! At this time, there is a crisis, that is, because after the typhoid fever has recovered, the stomach and intestines have not returned to normal, and the old wounds in the intestines have just healed, they cannot withstand stagnation. There are three reasons for the recurrence of typhoid fever: sickness from overeating, sickness from labor, and sickness from being exposed to cold. Among them, most cases are caused by eating too much. Because the stomach needs food very strongly after the disease, the digestive capacity of the intestines, where the old wounds have just healed, is very difficult. The stomach is strong and the intestines are weak, which is why it is most prone to recurrence. Therefore, you should still abstain from food during the illness. There are many of the above-mentioned beverages, and you can take one each day and rotate them to change the taste. You should not try several kinds in one day.

The above-mentioned items have been almost completely covered in the four days after the retreat of cold and heat from typhoid fever. It is not advisable to try other items. Greasy, meaty, raw, cold and wild game are all taboo.

### Introduction to Six Kinds of Nourishing Foods (Middle)

— Hu Xianglin

Walnut Wine: Method: Mash purple-clothed walnuts with their skins on, add good aged wine, put them in a pot and cook thoroughly, and add a little sugar.

Regular consumption can nourish the brain and produce essence, make the skin smooth and shiny, make the beard and hair black and lustrous, and make the blood vessels smooth. Walnuts contain a large amount of fat, which can make bowel movements smooth. Its skin contains tannic acid, which can treat nocturnal emission and panting. Every morning, take two or three fried salted walnuts with their skins on and drink it with milk or cocoa, which also has nourishing effects.

Yam Powder: Method: Soak one liter of glutinous rice in water overnight, drain and stir-fry over low heat until very hot, grind and sieve it like flying flour. Slightly stir-fry fresh Huai yam, grind it into powder and add it to the rice flour. Every morning, take half a cup and add one teaspoon of sugar or a little walnut powder, and serve it with boiling water. It can treat diarrhea, nocturnal emission, and reduce food intake. Yam can relieve irritation in the intestines and increase absorption in the intestinal walls. It can also ingest the essence gate.

### Children's Dessert "Spleen-Strengthening Powder"

Most children are gluttonous and like to eat snacks in addition to regular meals, but many snacks are unhygienic and difficult to digest, so children often suffer from food poisoning and gastrointestinal diseases, so you have to pay attention to children's snacks. When a child's face is yellow, gluttonous, thin, and about to develop malnutrition, there is a "spleen-strengthening powder" that has many effects such as strengthening the spleen, eliminating food, and killing insects when given to children. Use two ounces of Huai yam, ten chicken gizzards, two ounces of sesame seeds, two ounces of lentils, four cents of charred hawthorn charcoal, one ounce of Jianlian meat, one ounce of Poria, five cents of Quisqualis indica, and three liters of white rice. First, stir-fry the rice, sesame seeds, etc. separately, then grind them into powder, and mix them evenly to make it successful. When eating, add white sugar, or eat it dry or with boiled water, it tastes sweet and fragrant, it is really a food that is most suitable for children's intestines and stomach.

### Low-Cost Nutritional Food

— Zhu Zuosan

Turtle: Turtle is a very common aquatic animal that can be eaten in all seasons. Because it has the essence of hiding to Yin, it is especially suitable for eating in winter. Turtle shells are often used in medicines to nourish Yin and reduce fever. As for turtle meat, its nature is sweet and neutral. The Separate Records states: "It mainly treats injuries, benefits qi, and supplements insufficiency." It is also listed as a tonic in the New Materia Medica, and is truly a wonderful product for nourishing Yin (blood, body fluids, endocrine) and also treats beriberi.

Pig Blood: Remember that President Sun Yat-sen's theory in the example of knowing is difficult and doing is easy once mentioned using pig blood to replenish blood. Pig blood is the cheapest thing, and its blood-replenishing power is well known to everyone. According to the Materia Medica, it can produce blood and also treat stroke, headache, and dizziness. Because pig blood contains iron and other substances, after digestion and absorption, it produces the effect of increasing blood. As for stroke, headache, dizziness, etc., they are all caused by blood deficiency, high blood pressure, or anemia leading to neurasthenia. Regular consumption of pig blood often heals, so "replenishing blood with blood" seems to be a very foreseeing theory, but the fact is that it is extremely effective.

### Recent Popular Evil Disease: Smallpox and the Problem of Hunger and Satiety

— You Xuezhou

Diet is for nourishing life, and also for causing death. Those who are sick should pay especially close attention to their diet. If it is appropriate, it can assist the inadequacy of medicine, and through reasonable nourishment, increase the power to resist disease. If it is not appropriate, it will only increase the burden on the digestion of the stomach and intestines, and the disease will take the opportunity to expand its power.

"Hungry measles, full pox" is a common saying. Roughly translated, it means that for measles, diet should be moderate, and being slightly hungry is best; for smallpox, the opposite is true, food should be plentiful, and there is no need to deliberately suppress it or reduce the amount eaten. Ordinary people, with an example to follow and a saying to rely on, no longer restrict the diet of those suffering from smallpox—some, feeling hungry, are frequently given food; others, with weak stomachs and no appetite, are forced to eat more. The final result is that the stomach and intestines become stagnant, or diarrhea occurs, causing a significant change.

The saying "full pox" cannot be absolutely denied; however, one should act according to the situation. It does not mean that all types of pox should have their appetite satisfied, making them full at every meal. The elimination of disease relies on the control of medicine on the one hand, and on the body's own ability to resist in the long term on the other. This resistance comes from the nourishment provided by diet. If those with a disease can eat, the production of resistance can be endless. Since smallpox is a dangerous disease that lasts a long time, if there is no food to nourish it, there will be no ability to resist in the long term. Therefore, being able to eat is a good thing. The meaning of "full pox" should be viewed from the opposite perspective—not seeking to be full, but not allowing hunger. However, this only refers to those whose digestive system is not obstructed by the smallpox. If food tastes bad, or there is no appetite, what good is it to force food down? The most important point of dietary nourishment is to stop when appropriate, not allowing hunger, nor overeating, and even more so, not forcing extra meals.

Smallpox is a pestilence. It is better to clear it than to supplement it. Therefore, one should not be prejudiced about diet, lest complications arise and lead to an irreversible situation. According to my experience, if those suffering from smallpox, whether infants or adults, show slight dysentery at the beginning—but excessive diarrhea is to be avoided—the course will be smooth. This is the body's own method of self-rescue, allowing the heat toxin to be discharged, reducing the epidemic's power, and easing the symptoms. It is also a wonderful physiological function. In this regard, being able to eat with smallpox is a good thing. If one does not want to eat, or eats little, one should not force them to eat, or eat without limit, adding a burden to digestion, giving the pestilence reinforcements and making the flames even stronger, turning originally peaceful symptoms into a dangerous situation. Life and death can be reversed in an instant. Those in the family who are responsible for caring for the sick should be careful not to be constrained by common sayings!

### Securities: Interest Payments Have an Immediate Impact, Foreign Debt Market Prices Continue to Rise, British and German Bonds Reach £72, British and French Bonds Continue to Rise by £2, Many Domestic Bonds are Traded Speculatively

London's listing prices for Chinese foreign debt on the 8th of this month (Wednesday) were affected by the announcement of the timely payment of principal and interest on the continued British-German loans. Confidence immediately turned positive, and most bonds rose by half a pound or a pound. British and French loan bonds rose by £2 to a price of £52. Of the remaining four types, all rose by half a pound except for the Sino-French US dollar bonds, which remained unchanged. British-German continued loan bonds continued to rise to £71, British gold consolidation bonds rose to £48.5, Crisp bonds rose to £34, and Fick Aircraft bonds rose to £14.

The Beijing-Shanghai and Guangzhou-Kowloon railway bonds each rose by one pound, the former priced at £23 and the latter at £19.5. The rest remained unchanged. The London physical supply included £2,000 of British and French loan bonds, sold at £52.5, half a pound above the market price. £3,000 of Crisp bonds drawn between 1936 and 1938 were also sold at £52.5, £18.5 above the market price (these drawn bonds, if they are restored to principal payment in the future, will be given priority and the interest rate is half a percent higher than British and French loans, so the asking price is the same as British and French). Previously, there were £2,000 each of the original German-issued and subsequent German-issued Jinpu Railway bonds, sold at £17 each, one pound above the market price, and 15 shillings higher than yesterday's market. There was also £1,000 of German-issued printed Huguang Railway bonds, sold at £20, on par with the market.

London British Far East companies' stock market prices on the 8th of this month (Wednesday) showed little change. Only the Jardine Matheson Bank stock continued to rise by two shillings and six pence, priced at £9.5. The Kailuan Mining Administration stock rebounded by six pence, priced at 17 shillings and six pence. The rest remained unchanged.

The unofficial securities market saw fluctuating conditions yesterday. There were increases and decreases in the morning and afternoon, and trading gradually calmed. There were slightly more transactions, causing fluctuations. Retail investors were nothing more than temporary speculators, going in and out, shifting with the market. Because the end of the year is approaching, all parties are waiting to see what happens next year, making it the end of the year. Today, Type A will hold its seventh lottery. The market price should be calculated ex-dividend.

Yesterday's Market: In the morning, Xin Fenglian's short covering initially appeared strong, but turned weak after Nos. 5 and Yonghe sold. The range of fluctuations was about three to four corners. In the afternoon, the situation was the opposite of the morning. It was initially weak due to selling by Nos. 10 and Yongkang, but slightly stronger due to buying by Tongkang and No. 64. Although the price of Type A, which was drawn consecutively, was the last day, it did not rise and fall like other types due to the selling of Yongkang, so the result was a small three corners. Types Ding and 96 did not trade, and the rest were slightly better by three or four corners. The total transaction volume was estimated at over 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Stock Transactions: Yesterday, 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 5 yuan and 7 jiao. The rest were ignored, it is said.

### Finance: Loan News Resurfaces, Cash Prices Suddenly Weaken

Yesterday's conditions in the unofficial market for cash sycee continued to be flat and weak. The price declined because cash shops, silver shops, and northern merchants came to sell. Only Zhongsong caused some silver firms and Hong Kong merchants to purchase due to rumors of tight and weak foreign exchange, so the market price once turned strong. In the end, Reuters suddenly reported that the UK would continue to lend China HK$60 million. This caused confidence to turn downward again, pushing the price to the 2,040 yuan mark. Trading was slightly stronger than the previous day. There was no change in silver jewelry. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold also did not rise or fall.

Sycee Unofficial Market Falls by One Yuan

Since this morning, a certain silver shop initially called for 2,042 yuan per bar (10 taels) to buy. At that time, a certain gold shop also intended to buy. However, sellers were only willing to supply at 46 yuan. Therefore, the two sides held out until about 10 o'clock before trading began. First, a certain silver shop bought 50 taels each from cash shops and peers, both at 2,044 yuan as the opening price. Subsequently, gold shops and silver shops traded 50 taels with each other, both at the same price as before. After this, the price gradually declined due to slightly more sellers. A gold shop sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange business at 43 yuan. After the money exchange business absorbed it, it bought 50 taels from northern merchants at the original price. Later, the gold shop sold another 50 taels to the money exchange business at 41 yuan. In addition, a certain silver shop also sold 50 taels to a certain silver firm, at the same price. After this, foreign exchange softened slightly due to foreign firms scooping up, so the selling wind stopped immediately. A certain gold shop also turned from selling to buying, and a certain silver firm continued to absorb, so the price went upward. A certain silver firm bought 50 taels from the silver shops, and the price jumped to 45 yuan. Subsequently, a gold shop bought 50 taels from the silver shops at 46 yuan. Later, the silver shops sold 50 taels to the money exchange business again at the same price. The silver shops sold 50 taels to the money exchange business again at 45 yuan. The time was already 11:15. After this, there was no trading, and the price remained fixed. Therefore, the midday closing price was still 45 yuan. In the afternoon, at about 2 o'clock, a certain money exchange business first bought 50 taels from the gold shop at 45 yuan. After this, the buying intention of the money exchange business was still strong, but sellers were scarce. Later, it bought 50 taels from the silver shops at 47 yuan as the highest peak. At 3:45, the silver shops sold 50 taels to the money exchange business again at 45 yuan. At that time, Reuters suddenly reported that the UK would continue to lend China HK$60 million, so confidence leaned downward. Most floating long positions wanted to sell, but buyers were mostly watching. Although the price was called down to 40 yuan, it was still difficult to find a match, so the late closing price was still 2,045 yuan, which was one yuan lower than the previous day. The range of the whole day was 6 yuan. The selling price of cash shop's own brand gold was 2,050 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,035 yuan. The current premium gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no trading.

Jewelry Gold Still at Original Price

The selling price of silver jewelry per tael has not changed. Datong Heng and Lao Qingyun still hang at the original price of 207 yuan, and Xin Tonghang hangs at the original price of 205 yuan, with a purchase price of 199 yuan.

British Pure Gold Unchanged

An 8th London dispatch states that British pure gold per ounce has not changed, still at £7 8s 4d, so the central bank's Chinese cash purchase price also remains at 1,210 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs duty still shows no change, remaining at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remains fixed, still calculated at 1,206 yuan and 2 jiao.

### Korean Bills Have Started Trading

Yesterday, both British pure gold and British-American exchange rates did not change. The demand for foreign exchange was still strong. The supply intentions of Hong Kong telegrams and banks were slightly smoother, and the trend was slightly weaker. The supply of sycee was not smooth. Real users’ absorption turned weak. Fearing the government's maintenance of foreign exchange, they did not dare to boldly drag in, so the market price remained stable, and trading was slightly inferior. The price of foreign currency rose slightly due to the slight weakness of the exchange rate. US dollar bills, Hong Kong bills, and foreign banks had more demand. Korean bill transactions have also started. The guild's transactions are still prosperous. Qintai sold and Hongtai bought HK$500 of Hong Kong bills. Litong sold and Chenghai bought US$1,000 of US dollar bills. Qintai sold and Chenghai bought US$500 of US dollar bills. Zhenxing sold and Chenghai bought US$300 of US dollar bills. Sentai sold and Hongchang bought HK$1,000 of Hong Kong Cai. Taihe and Chenghai sold and Chenghai bought £110 of British gold bills.

### Discount Rates Show Little Change

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange transfers remained fixed. Each 1,000 yuan fluctuated around 35 yuan all day. The final price was 35 yuan, which was the same as the previous day's price.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Diverge

An 8th London dispatch stated that the market was stable, with few changes. After closing, it was flat and slightly stagnant. Large bar silver did not change in the near term, and the far term shrank by 0.0625. A New York silver dispatch stated that the American difficult price remained fixed. A Mumbai silver dispatch stated that the Indian silver market was calm, spot goods did not move, and both near and far terms increased by two annas.

### Numerous Wheat Settlement Transactions, Foreign Exchange Turns Tight Again, Later Heard UK Will Continue to Loan to China, Market Condition Immediately Turns From Tight to Stable

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw numerous wheat settlement transactions and other foreign firms' settlements were also quite large. In addition, foreign banks had limited funds, so the underlying trend was tight. Later, Reuters suddenly reported that the UK would continue to lend China HK$60 million, and Hong Kong telegrams came to sell heavily, so the situation stopped being tight and turned flat. There were slight twists and turns in the middle, but no excessive fluctuations. Trading was quite active. Hong Kong exchange was initially quite strong with foreign banks absorbing, and the underlying trend was also tight. Later, money exchange businesses heard news that the UK would continue to loan China, so they frequently sold, causing the underlying trend to return to flat immediately.

In the morning, the London large bar was nearly flat and the far term shrunk. New York banks did not move, and London raw gold also did not rise or fall. The exchange rate shrank 1 li from pound to dollar, fell 4 centimes from pound to franc, and was 0.0625 from pound to Shanghai. The dollar to pound did not change, the dollar to franc was small 0.0625, and the dollar to Shanghai was large 5 fen. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained fixed as before. The bank's early selling price was 8 pence 2.03125 for the British exchange rate and 16 yuan for the US exchange rate, which was flat for the British exchange rate and tight 0.03125 for the US exchange rate compared to the previous day's midday closing. Although a certain foreign firm was scooping up, the foreign banks' supply intentions were also good at that time, so the situation was still stable. A certain foreign firm settled and bought Jardine Matheson and American Bank's Dutch American exchange rate at 16 yuan. HSBC's listed exchange rate announcement did not move, and the silver balance tax announcement also did not fluctuate. After this, there were numerous wheat settlement transactions. A certain foreign firm absorbed HSBC, Jardine Matheson's British gold at 8 pence 2.03125 and 1.875. Subsequently, foreign banks also bought Hong Kong telegrams and British gold at 8 pence 2.03125. Later, a certain foreign firm settled and bought only 15 yuan and 9375 jiao of the Chinese-Belgian American exchange rate, so the process was quite tight. Near noon, the money exchange business sold Dutch Hong Kong exchange at 54 yuan and 5 jiao to Anda, so the trend was slightly flat. In the afternoon, the bank's selling price was 8 pence 1.71875 for the British exchange rate and 5 yuan and 9375 jiao for the US exchange rate.

Later, it was suddenly heard from Reuters that the UK would continue to lend China HK$60 million, and Hong Kong telegrams first came to sell to Yili, HSBC, and Jardine Matheson's British gold at 8 pence 1.875 and US$16, so the process slightly recovered. After this, the underlying trend hardened again because foreign firms scooped up again. Foreign firms ate HSBC, Jardine Matheson at 8 pence 1.71875 and US$15 yuan and 9375 jiao. Finally, the money exchange firms frequently sold Hong Kong exchange, selling Dutch and China Justice Hong Kong exchange at 54 yuan and half and 75 jiao, so the situation was slightly flat. The bank's selling price was the same as the midday closing price until the late closing: 8 pence 1.71875 for the British exchange rate and 15 yuan and 9375 jiao for the US exchange rate. As a result, the British exchange rate was tighter by 0.03125 and the US exchange rate was softer by 0.09375 compared to the previous day's midday closing, while Hong Kong was flat.

### Textiles: White Goods and Fine Twill: Chinese Factories Receive Huge Orders, East Goods Speculators Have High Spirits

The current sales of domestic cloth in the southwest are still quite considerable. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants added nearly 100 boxes of light-colored cloth, printed cloth, and satin. Guangdong merchants have recently been actively purchasing white goods and fine twill. There is also demand for dyed blanks in this street. However, due to the large orders received by various Chinese factories, the production of fine twill has decreased, and the amount of inventory on the market has gradually become scarce. The price has also increased by about 1 jiao (per bolt). Yesterday, Guangdong merchants purchased about 50 pieces of various brands. Merchants in this street purchased more than 100 pieces, priced at 11 yuan to 11 yuan and 6 jiao. Fujian merchants continued to purchase more than 60 pieces of colored twill, blue cloth, line wool, and serge. Yantai merchants on the northern route purchased 40 to 50 boxes of serge and bleached cloth. Wholesale shops in this street purchased nearly 50 bales of current goods of Dapeng, Peacock, and Fumei fine cloth. 200 boxes of Hongzhang Sanyang striped silk for March and April futures are priced at 4 jiao and 8 fen per yard.

The East Cloth market continues to be good. Fellow merchants are more and more excited about business. Speculators and dyeing factories in this street have searched for more than 1,000 pieces of current goods of fine cloth and fine twill. The sales prices have all increased by 5 fen to 7 and a half fen (per bolt). The current price of Longtou fine cloth is 11 yuan and 9 jiao, while the order price for March and April futures of East cotton is 12 yuan and 2 and a half jiao (per bolt). Others such as Caiqiu Flying Fish still need to be increased by 5 fen, (per bolt) selling at 12 yuan 2 and a half to 3 jiao. In total, each shop has continued to sell about 500 to 600 pieces.

### Food: Guest Xian Rice Sales Are Still Active, Dumi Transactions Are Limited

Guest Xian rice was affected by the fall of the original tip this morning, and buyers were waiting and watching. Transactions were less than 1,000 bags, and the market suddenly showed a weak trend. By the afternoon, speculators suddenly absorbed the low prices, and more than 2,000 sentences were agreed one after another. The market shape immediately turned from weak to easy. All the high-grade goods were called up by one angle. Nanjing High Xian goods were missing and not opened. High Wu Xian was raised to 10 yuan and 098 jiao, and Da Shi goods was 10 yuan and 023 jiao. If the hoarding is not declining now and tomorrow, then there is still the possibility of a step-up in the later market, it is said.

The source of domestic rice has arrived at He Xia No. 4, with more than 2,000 bags of wheel car buns. The Lunar New Year is approaching, and most of the trading parties are engaged in closing. Therefore, yesterday's local sales turned slack, hoarders stopped, and transactions on the market were limited. As a result, the market was in a stalemate. The price of thick and thin japonica rice was high, and the materials were all unchanged. Only the mid-grade goods were sold widely at low prices, and a few more fen to one jiao were added. The market for Du Yangjian and Butujian japonica rice was stable. The high-priced goods are still opened at 15 yuan, but the eyes of the next delivery are falling. It is heard that the rice market business is allowed to engage in closing and holidays from the 14th. Therefore, there are only four days from today, and it will reopen on the red market next spring. Therefore, there will not be much change in the market in these days.

### Flour Sales to Nanyang Still Strong, More Than 10,000 Bags Shipped to Shantou Today

Yesterday's flour market trend was from stable to firm. The recent customer sales have been good, and the scattered sales of Nanyang merchants are more enthusiastic than those of Beiyang merchants. This is because foreign wheat imports in Nanyang are still taxed, so the demand for Shen flour is still strong, while in Beiyang, local foreign flour is dumped, and it is difficult to expect smooth sales for a while. The factory still lacks current inventory, and its selling intention is quite firm. The No. 1 flour factory's market is firmly stationed at 4 yuan and 8 jiao of the original market. The unified market transactions still have more than 8,000 bags. The North and South merchants each loaded nearly 10,000 bags. The price of the lower foot powder market is rising, and there is still no proper transaction.

Today, there are 14,200 bags of flour shipped to Shantou.

### Australian Flour Also Arrives in Shanghai in Large Quantities, High-Priced Wheat Prices Increase

The wheat market shows no special development. The sources of supply from various places have fallen recently. Yesterday, 500 bags came from Xin Gang. The inventory in the Shanghai market is also thin. At this time when there are few inventories, the factory will gradually have sufficient raw materials for flour production and plans to wait until next year to do it again, so the market has already presented a closing scene. The unified market sells a kind of high-grade Jiangbei wheat, with an amount of 1,300 bags. The Fuxin factory handles 300 bags, and the Fuxin factory handles 1,000 sentences, priced at 6 yuan and 6 jiao and 5 fen, which is another 5 fen higher than before. According to the current arrival of foreign wheat from various factories, it is necessary to match domestic high-grade wheat, so the price of high-grade materials is increased. The middle and inferior grade goods are not eaten by the factory stomach, and the market is still flat.

The source of US wheat has been reported in this newspaper many times. Now it is learned that Australian flour has also arrived in large quantities. The Janda and Co., managed by the Great Britain Company, imported 2,000 tons of wheat flour from Australia on the 8th (the day before yesterday), totaling more than 50,000 bags. Although this kind of wheat flour is often loaded, it has never been as much as this time, it is said.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn and Cloth Waiting Quietly for Closing, Speculators Are Still Dragging in When Prices Fall, Real Sales Business Remains Silent

The yarn market has turned clearer, because it is the end of the year and people are quiet, and all parties are busy closing, and there is no intention to do business. Therefore, the transaction is terribly silent. Because there are not many ships traveling and the number of flights to the customer side during the year, they must wait for the new spring to develop the layer of doing business. As for the speculators, they have been eating in for days, and the amount is already considerable. At present, their intention is slightly slack, and they are not anxious to search for it. However, when the price falls, they still come to seize cheap goods, so 20-count Shuangma broke the 400 yuan mark. A certain XX came to absorb it again, and by the time of closing, it turned tight and went out of the 400 yuan mark again.

Selling Price Falls by Two or Three Yuan

In the current yarn market, the market opened early in the morning. Due to the small number of real needs transactions, there were no telegrams from customers to Shanghai, and there was a lack of entrustment. The popularity was scattered. The two sides delayed for a long time before the market opened. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 2 yuan compared to the 10th, which was 401 yuan and a half. The same industry traded 30 bales, and the Shantou merchant entered 30 bales of Tiannv, and the monk was 401 yuan. After this, the spot business remained sluggish as before, and the floating long selling intention was relaxed again and softened by one step, falling into the 400 yuan mark, but small speculators were aware of the low price and came to drag in again, and then returned to the outside of the customs. As a result, the transaction volume in the morning was 537 bales, and the actual customer sales were less than 200 sentences. The market price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 3 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, while Te Jincheng fell by 2 yuan, Tiannv fell by 2 and a half yuan, Shuangdiqiu fell by 3 yuan, 10-count coarse yarn was still flat, and there was no word of any action from Guangfang. Today, there are 1,770 pieces of yarn shipped to Shantou and 80 pieces shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed on the left.

Cotton Yarn Guild's Closing Market Has a Period

The current yarn market of the Cotton Yarn Industry Association is now agreed to stop trading from February 17 to February 23, and then resume normal trading and business, and resume afternoon trading. The meeting will be changed to a full-day business.

The Demand for Japanese Yarn Declines Silently

The Japanese yarn market is abnormally clear, and the number of attendees has greatly decreased. Because the end of the year has arrived, all parties have no stomach, so the market price declines by two or three yuan due to the silence of demand. The current yarn price of 20-count Shuiyue is 327 yuan, and the current yarn price of 20-count Lanfeng is 322 yuan, it is said.

### US Cotton Falls in the Near Term and Rises in the Far Term, Domestic Cotton Has Only Two Transactions

In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was more appraising yesterday. It rose early due to buying on Wall Street. Later, because each yarn factory deeply considered that the government's loan cotton sales would reduce market prices, it sold the previously purchased spot goods and recent goods one after another, changed to dragging on the far term. Therefore, yesterday's market price fell in the near term and rose in the far term. The New York Financial News estimated that this year's cotton field was 25,391,000 acres, which was a huge reduction of 1,058,000 acres compared to last year's government statistics of 26,449,000 acres. The exchange rate was extended at once in the morning yesterday, and then shrunk in the afternoon. Converting to legal currency, cotton prices all fell, with US cotton and Brazilian cotton falling by 3 jiao per load, Indian cotton falling by 2 jiao, and Egyptian cotton falling by 8 jiao per quintal.

The foreign cotton transaction in Shanghai Port is still unusually dull. Only each factory takes advantage of this leisure time to ask each foreign firm for various cotton samples, analyzes the quality, and compares the prices, etc., as a reference for purchasing cotton in the red market. Yesterday's transaction was quiet. The cotton prices yesterday are recorded below.

Raw Materials Category Delivery to Factory Including Tax

The domestic cotton business has completely entered a state of standstill. The factory's use of Indian cotton is gradually surging, and the need for each factory is sufficient. In addition, the end of the year is approaching, and the intention of handling is quite sparse. According to the cotton merchants, there is a part that is slightly easy, but the amount is also very small. Only two batches were transacted today. The source of supply from northern Jiangsu is also rare. 736 bales of Tonghua arrived, 258 pieces from Xin Gang, 280 pieces from Beisha, and 352 pieces from Baimao. The current cotton prices are recorded on the left.

### Installment Repayment Procedures for Government Bonds

The sixth installment of principal and interest of the Unified Government Bonds maturing on January 31, 1939, has been clearly stipulated by the government to be paid in Chongqing, while in Shanghai, cash will be received in six installments, and Shanghai-approved certificates will be issued. For the convenience of our readers, this newspaper has investigated the receiving procedures as follows:

The actual receiving procedure is quite simple. First, obtain an "Application for a Permit to Exchange Government Bond Principal and Interest" from the Central Bank and fill it out item by item. Then, submit it to the Treasury Department of the Central Bank together with the principal and interest coupons of the bonds. After the Central Bank receives the application and verifies the principal and interest coupons, it will issue a temporary receipt and advance one-sixth of the amount. After receiving this temporary receipt, the holder of the bond principal and interest coupons can exchange it for a remittance permit from the Ministry of Finance and receive one-sixth of the amount from the Central Bank each month.

However, filling out the application forms can be cumbersome. Therefore, further explanations are provided below: For example, if a reader holds twenty 100-yuan bonds of Unified C Bonds, and the interest to be received for each bond is three yuan. Then, in the "Bond Name" field, write "Unified C," in the "Installment Number" field, write "6," in the "Principal and Interest Amount to be Received per Bond" field, write "Three Yuan," in the "Number of Bonds" field, write "Twenty," in the "Amount" field, write "Sixty Yuan," and in the "Deducted Interest or Income Tax on Interest Coupon" field, write "Three Yuan," because 60 - 3 = 57. Therefore, in the "Payable National Currency" field, write "Fifty-seven Yuan."

This is the simplest case. If a reader holds more than one type of Unified Government Bond, and the face value is not just 100 yuan, then they should be filled out separately for Unified A, Unified B, Unified C, Unified D, and Unified E. For the "Principal and Interest Amount to be Received per Bond" field, for a face value of ten yuan, write "Thirty cents," for a face value of one hundred yuan, write "Three yuan," for a face value of one thousand yuan, write "Thirty yuan," and for a face value of five thousand yuan, write "One hundred and fifty yuan."

If the Unified Government Bond held by the reader has already been drawn in a lottery, then enter the face value in the "Principal and Interest Amount to be Received per Bond" field, and leave the "Deducted Interest or Income Tax on Interest Coupon" field blank. If the winning ticket has the sixth installment interest coupon attached, then combine it with other interest coupons of the same type and amount in one line. However, if the previously won bond is collected in this period, because the sixth installment interest coupon may have been cleverly cut off, then calculate the total amount of interest coupons cut off in previous periods and enter it in the "Deducted Interest or Income Tax on Interest Coupon" field.

Now, let's take the government bond principal and interest due on January 31, 1939, held by Ren Da Silver Firm as an example for readers' reference. Suppose the firm holds the following principal and interest coupons:

Principal and interest coupons of winning bonds: 1. Unified A: ten 100-yuan bonds, two 1,000-yuan bonds. 2. Unified B: five 10-yuan bonds, two 5,000-yuan bonds.

Interest coupons: 1. Unified A: thirty 30-cent coupons, twenty 3-yuan coupons (including a total of thirty for winning interest), ten 30-yuan coupons (including a total of twelve for winning tickets), three 150-yuan coupons. 2. Unified B: forty 30-cent coupons (including a total of forty-five for winning tickets), twenty-five 3-yuan coupons, fifteen 30-yuan coupons, five 150-yuan coupons (including a total of seven winning interest coupons).

Also, 3-yuan interest coupons include fifty Unified C coupons, one hundred Unified D coupons, and twenty-five Unified E coupons.

The application form should be filled out as follows:

Government Bond Installment

Name Number

Principal and Interest Amount to be Received Per

Bond Number Amount (Yuan)

Deducted Interest or Income Tax on Interest Coupon Payable National Currency (Yuan)

After the Central Bank receives the application and verifies it, it will immediately issue 2,653 yuan and 56 cents in cash, and issue a temporary receipt, the format of which is as follows:

Note: The signatures of the Central Bank personnel in charge are affixed below "Payable First Installment Ticket" and to the right of "Central Bank of Shanghai."

After receiving this temporary receipt, Ren Da Silver Firm can exchange it for a remittance permit in the future, and receive one-sixth of the amount from the Central Bank each month.

As for the format of the remittance permit, it is said to be roughly similar to government bond interest coupons, and is cut off monthly. As of now, this remittance permit has not yet been issued.

Regarding the withdrawal of small amounts such as 30-cent or 3-yuan interest coupons, it has not yet occurred, because interest coupon holders would never pay for the round-trip fare and go through the cumbersome procedures for such a small amount. Most of them are sold to small money changers or firms.

### Fried Cakes Remote Soybean Oil Transactions Are Not Many Raw Oil Market Conditions Become Tight Both Soybean Import and Export Occur

The soybean oil market, due to the approaching year-end, has seen little interest in buying and selling. Yesterday, a foreign firm was selling forward goods, although the transaction volume was not large, the market atmosphere has softened. Two hundred barrels of lower-period oil for March were traded at a price of 28 yuan and 1 jiao and a half, and the delivery price at the end of the month was also opened at 28 yuan and 1 jiao and a half, with 150 barrels traded. Two or three days of delivery were first opened at 28 yuan and 1 jiao and a half for 50 barrels, and then dropped to 27 yuan and 9 jiao and a half, with only 50 barrels traded. The current oil is quoted for more than a hundred barrels, with prices divided into 28 yuan and 2 jiao and 28 yuan.

Peanut oil, due to rumors of a ban on exports from Qingdao, the market has shifted from stable to tight, but the fluctuations are still small. It is difficult to be optimistic because the change comes from a certain means. Yesterday, it was calculated that 200 tins of Qingdao oil would continue to be handled with the chemical gang, with the price being the original plate of 30 yuan and 5 jiao. The local street inquired about 200 pieces of Jiaozhou basket oil, with the price being 21 yuan and 4 jiao, an increase of 2 jiao from the previous day. One hundred pieces of road goods were traded at a price of 21 yuan.

Yesterday, 150 pieces of soybean oil came from Yantai, and today 500 pieces of raw oil are being transported to Hong Kong.

In addition, 200 bags of soybeans came from Xingang yesterday, and 700 bags are also being transported to Shantou today.

### Sugar Market Minghua Japanese Sugar Has Been Underwritten by Someone Profit Is the Only Goal, Forgetting Righteousness

Five thousand packages of new Chao sugar will arrive in Shanghai today and tomorrow

Yesterday, there was not much change in the sugar market. The association's pricing and the firm's pricing only saw small transactions. According to Shantou gang news, new Chao sugar, both green, red, and white, has been loaded and is on its way. It is estimated that the Taikoo Company's Qingyuan Wheel has a total of about 5,000 outer packages, and it is expected to be imported today or tomorrow. New Chao green sugar is mostly transported to Oushi for sales because the market there is better, so only a few arrive in Shanghai. It is also rumored that the products of the Minghua Japanese Sugar Factory have been underwritten by someone. It can be seen that merchants seek profit and use all means to achieve their goals. However, it is appropriate to have some discretion in this matter. It must be known that buying more goods from a certain source will reduce one's own strength by a certain amount, inevitably seeing profit and forgetting righteousness, and lacking national consciousness. Those who do this will cut themselves off from the Chinese people.

### The Path for Educated Youths

— Mao Lie

Originally, our country has many strong men, and there is no problem with the source of soldiers. There is no need for educated youths to join the army with guns. Therefore, Madam Soong Mei-ling recently published an article saying that students only need to directly or indirectly awaken the anti-Japanese consciousness of the Chinese people during the war, and improve the lives of the people, which is enough.

However, these words are Madam Soong's intention to care for educated youths, that is, the path for educated youths to serve the country is more important than being a soldier, and it is not to say that they absolutely do not need to be soldiers. Therefore, if we combine her words with Chairman Chiang's order a few days ago to encourage the children of party and government officials to join the army, we can discover that their intentions are exactly the same: every educated youth should take responsibility for saving the country, either going to the front line to fight, or engaging in national salvation movements in the rear.

The children of party and government officials are of course educated youths. Since the War of Resistance, although Chiang Ching-kuo's leading troops and Feng Yuxiang's eldest son's death in Nanyuan are enough to be models for these children, there must still be a majority who are drunk and dreaming, or living in leisure and pleasure. Chairman Chiang wants them all to enlist in the army, not only to set an example for the people, but also to strengthen the strength of the War of Resistance. In fact, he has clearly designated another way for educated youths to serve the country. We support this proposal.

I think every educated youth, those who can go to the front line to fight should go to the front line to fight, and those who can be active in the rear should be active in the rear. These are the two paths they should take now. Studying hard, studying hard, and doing everything possible outside of class to engage in national salvation can of course be included in the scope of rear activities. Educated youths, please cherish this and do not give up your responsibilities.

However, in my personal opinion, it is better for educated youths to do their best on the front line than to do their best in the rear. Because hiding in the rear inevitably has the suspicion of avoiding responsibility, which will lead to the malpractice of abandoning responsibility. Once they go to the front line, I think their influence, whether on the front line or in the rear, will definitely be great. Chairman Chiang's order may have some meaningful implications!

### On the Road (Part 2)

— Wall Grass

"Watch me beat you!" Someone shouted and threw a brick. They tucked their tails and scattered in a panic.

The three of us prisoners happened to walk together. The small-faced primary school teacher named Li was trembling. He was very scared and muttered to himself:

"I haven't committed any crime. I have always been stable, teaching to earn a living, which is also a helpless and troublesome thing!"

After saying that, he looked at my face as if wanting to gain some comfort, but when he saw my nonchalant look, he disappointedly averted his eyes quickly.

"Is that so? I haven't committed any crime. The bureau will definitely not send me to the ×× headquarters, right?" He couldn't talk to me, so he stretched his head to the ear of the rice store apprentice next to him.

The rice store apprentice was not yet twenty years old, and the villagers called him Xiao Zhu. He seemed honest in his behavior: he was not happy to pay attention to the small-faced primary school teacher, and only kept complaining to the fake police in a low voice:

"Gentlemen, I am an apprentice! Think about it, how could I join any guerrillas? And I am a local, my family has fields and houses, and parents and brothers. How can I do this bandit-like business? I understand very well that this is a great treason that will be beheaded!"

"This little thing is hateful!" I bit my lip.

"Gentlemen, please help me when we get to the bureau, explain it for me, I will definitely not forget you. If you are not at ease, I can ask someone to ask the town chief to guarantee!"

The primary school teacher also seemed unwilling to be lonely, and stuttered:

"I am the same as him, I have not committed a crime, I have a good citizen certificate; I can also ask someone to guarantee!"

The tall fake police officer walking slightly ahead became impatient, turned his head around:

"Don't worry, you can come out after staying at the bureau for a while."

"Gentlemen, does my appearance look like a bad person?" The rice store apprentice had a bitter smile on his face.

Everyone looked at him: a short body, a round and flat nose tip, a protruding forehead, but the cheeks were shrinking without any flesh, just like a monkey. This funny appearance made everyone laugh; on the one hand, it seemed to break the silence, and everyone deliberately prolonged their laughter for a while.

The buck-toothed beard in the back noticed and raised his voice to rebuke:

"What are you making noise about? No noise allowed!"

The thin white pockmark also followed with the same tone:

"Enough, what are you still laughing about?"

In fact, by the time he spoke, no one wanted to laugh anymore.

In a silence, someone began to complain again:

"It's really a living ghost! Making a fuss about nothing, saying that there is a large guerrilla team holding a secret meeting, loading bullets, inserting bayonets, ha, damn it, just these three! Their expressions don't even look real!"

"My legs were weak at first, but now it's fine!" One of them seemed to just catch a breath.

"But we got soaked in such a big rain!"

The sky quickly darkened, and the villages, forests, and vague ones became hideous giants. Everyone became silent and moved their feet faster. The rice store apprentice was still mumbling and complaining, but no one paid attention to him. The thin white pockmark raised his throat and urged me:

"Hurry up! Hurry up!"

His rude echoes burst out in the rainy night air.

### The Prime Minister's Trilogy

### Fire

— Ying Jin

Children love fire because fire has a mysterious element; old men love fire because fire temporarily recalls their youth; young people love fire because fire is full of vigorous vitality, with light, strength, and heat.

I am a young man, and like other young people, I also love fire.

However, my love of fire is not just these.

Although fire can destroy, it is an enlightenment of new life; although it can burn, it is a necessity for construction; although it can turn beautiful cities into scorched earth, it can also build a noble paradise of freedom on the scorched earth!

Also: intangible anger can also emit great power, burning away all the doubts and despicable dregs in mankind.

Fire is great, it is sacred and inviolable!

So, I love fire even more.

### People with Disabilities

— Jun Pei

There is a saying: "A blind person is vicious, a mute person has a knife in their belly!" This means that people with disabilities are the most sinister, and it is best not to provoke them. If you provoke them, or they provoke you, you should defend yourself well and not fall for their "poison," "trickery," or "knife."

Why are people with disabilities like this? This is nothing more than that they have defects, blame heaven and others, and are uneasy inside. Over time, they accumulate evil thoughts: on the one hand, they hate themselves for being born with disabilities, which cannot be completely hidden, and on the other hand, they are jealous of others for being well in front of them, and their stomachs are full of complaints and dissatisfaction, just hating that there is no place to vent; if anyone, intentionally or unintentionally, mentions some of their defects, they will naturally be ashamed and angry, and anger will arise from the heart and evil will arise from the gallbladder!

In short, a distorted body cultivates an abnormal psychology. In fact, people with disabilities do not need to cover up at all, let alone feel sorry for themselves, and especially do not need to resent others, wanting to get what they want. As long as they use their strengths and develop their special talents, they can also make achievements and make a difference, making people forget their shortcomings. And everyone has certain special talents. Not to mention the distant ones, for example, Goebbels was a cripple and became the Minister of Propaganda of Germany, and Avicenna was blind and became a world-famous poet. Otherwise, "a pockmarked face applying powder, depleting the old capital"; big feet wearing small shoes, and small feet wearing big shoes, not only do not look beautiful, but appropriately show the disgusting ugliness; and red eyebrows and green eyes, opening a bloody mouth, just wanting to eat people, will one day commit public anger and be beaten to death by a random stick.

Unfortunately, today's distorted body specializes in cultivating an abnormal psychology, and an abnormal psychology specializes in emitting crazy actions. Moreover, this kind of crazy action applied to one person and one thing is less harmful, but today's crazy action is often applied to a country and a nation, and the harm is immeasurable. This really makes people stomp their feet and sigh, and shout helplessly! Don't you believe it? Listen to me:

It is said that Napoleon's militarism was because he had incurable tinea on his belly, couldn't sleep at night, and couldn't get the favor of the princess of the country, so he took a risk. Huang Chao overthrew the Tang Dynasty and killed eight million people, because he was ugly when he went to Beijing to take the exam and couldn't get the top spot, so he rebelled in anger.

There are such people now. It is said that—helplessly, I can only say that, a high-ranking person, because he is a eunuch, can't get close to women all his life, and his heart is depressed, cultivating a strange temper, so the things he does, such as driving people to move, are mostly sinister and vicious, and not close to "humanity". Another high-ranking person, just meeting the conditions of "big head and thin feet, not interesting to raise", and a chin raised up, just like a tile cake, can be compared to Zhu Hongwu, and he has been looked down upon by people since he was a child, suffering a lot of resentment. Once he gains power, he robs openly and secretly, cheats and hard-knocks. Finally, there is also a high-ranking person, who is a "three-inch Ding, bark of a tree", and has never been taken seriously by people. So he climbed high everywhere and strived to go upstream. Although he earned some face in the end, he was still dissatisfied and did not hesitate to act perversely, harming lives, and妄想想to achieve his "跌金剛"purpose.

These three people, three people with disabilities, are said to be in the limelight, with the air of being invincible and unique. However, we can predict that their results will not be better than Napoleon or Huang Chao.

Because their crazy actions are not much different from those of Napoleon and Huang Chao.

Foreigners also have a saying: "A sound mind resides in a sound body." This can also be used to prove that people with physical disabilities are mentally unsound. Let's strive to be strong ourselves, and at the same time prevent people with disabilities!

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

At this time, a burst of rapid footsteps suddenly came from the courtyard outside, and a orderly soldier, panting, rushed straight into the room, stood at attention in front of Regiment Commander Ye, and gave a military salute.

"Reporting to the Regiment Commander..."

Regiment Commander Ye's face changed, and he hurriedly jumped up and asked:

"What's happening at the front?"

"Reporting to the Regiment Commander, Shihudang has fallen, and the enemy is attacking Fengjing Jiashan, which is very close to our defense area."

"Then go back quickly and tell Deputy Regiment Commander Liang and Battalion Commander Zhao, don't just defend, occupy the positions as soon as possible, choose favorable terrain, and fight the enemy, try to block them, don't let them rush over. Do you understand?"

"Understood!" The orderly soldier responded and ran back. Before he ran out of the courtyard, Regiment Commander Ye shouted at him from behind:

"Remember, pay special attention to the northeast. Tell them, I'll be right there."

Regiment Commander Ye hurriedly went into the room to pack up, put the briefcase under his arm, and waved goodbye to everyone in the room, saying:

"I'm leaving, don't panic, this place will probably be okay for a while."

"Fang Jun, be careful in front, come back when the war is over." Madam Ye's voice was a little choked, with two bags of clear tears in her eyes.

Regiment Commander Ye smiled slightly, as if laughing at his mother's lack of knowledge, how could she hope for the end when the war was just beginning. But at the same time, he also realized that this was a loving mother's love for her son, and he was deeply moved, and his face quickly darkened.

Fang Ying and Fang Hui grabbed their brother's arm again.

"Brother, can you go to the front with us now?"

"No, I have to run to the front line now, you can't run fast." Regiment Commander Ye said annoyedly, shaking off his younger siblings.

"I can run fast, I won first place in the running competition at the county sports meeting last time, believe it or not, let's try." Fang Ying said proudly.

"It's useless even if you run fast. Now the military situation at the front is urgent. I have to command the battle and don't have time to arrange you. Please wait for a while. As long as there is an opportunity, I will send someone to pick you up."

"Fang Ying, don't pester your brother." Old Master Ye also scolded from the side, waving his hand to Regiment Commander Ye and saying, "Go, so as not to delay military affairs."

Regiment Commander Ye responded and ran out like a whirlwind. (9)

### The Crisis of a Man Who Has Contracted a Hidden Illness and Hides It After Marriage!

Good that wants people to see is not true good, evil that fears people to know is great evil. Having a hidden illness and hiding it will eventually become a serious illness. Hiding illness is a common problem of Chinese people, especially when they have a hidden illness, they keep the secret in a sneaky way and never tell anyone, not even their wives. Once his wife or others see through it, they still use a set of nonsense such as "a gentleman does not like this way" or "cultivating oneself" to deceive people. There is also a kind of person who infects his wife with a hidden illness, but says that his wife infected him, which is even more a loss of personality.

What is a hidden illness? Smart people can know without explanation. Why do so many men in today's society have this kind of hidden illness? According to the judgment of doctors, half of it is because the moral standards of society are declining and tending towards the path of pornography; half of it is because young people are not deeply worldly-wise and have weak wills. Once tempted to be lustful without limit, polygamy and indulgence cause the sexual function to be severely injured and the fluid of the reproductive glands to dry up. Then, symptoms such as nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, kidney deficiency and impotence, scattered energy, infertility after a long marriage, and neurasthenia arise one after another. That is not only unable to satisfy the normal sexual life between husband and wife, causing the wife to hate it, and causing cracks in the love between husband and wife. If these cracks are not quickly repaired, the cracks will become larger and larger, just like the earth is splitting, which can destroy everything! Therefore, it is common for couples to separate or families to be destroyed because of this! In addition, because they hide their illness and do not seek treatment, or cannot be treated thoroughly, the condition worsens, causing brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, overall weakness and fatigue. This not only confines them to depression and pain all day long, but they also achieve nothing and have no interest in life, and will lead to premature aging and premature disability. How dangerous is this!

The so-called "you know your illness yourself." Once you discover a disease, if you are unmarried and have parents, you must inform your parents as soon as possible and ask them to pay for medical treatment, or take medicine for self-healing. If you are married and self-reliant, you must discuss it with your wife or good friends and strive for the most appropriate and effective treatment method. Otherwise, rushing to the doctor in desperation and taking medicine indiscriminately is also very dangerous, because quack doctors or similar drugs abound in the market. Taking aphrodisiacs by mistake, although it may be exciting for a while, will damage the function more severely. Like the effect of prescribing medicine for the disease, the longer the disease is delayed, the more deeply the root of the disease will penetrate. This is something that must be deeply noted. According to world-famous doctors and my many years of experience, for the above-mentioned diseases, it is generally recognized that taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" is the most appropriate and effective. Therefore, this agent can produce sperm and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate blood, and nourish nerves within one day and night after taking it, so that the symptoms are reduced. If you continue to take it, you can completely restore your health in a short period of time. If taken for a long time, it can make the body twice as strong and healthy, and have the effect of returning to youth. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Hymit's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the essence and stop the leakage, so that the effect can be more rapid; but if patients can come to this clinic in person for diagnosis by expert doctors, and use various specialties such as electrotherapy, injection, and surgery, cure can be guaranteed.

Common Diseases of Young People

### Neglected Nocturnal Emission!

— Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nian-zeng

Nocturnal emission, in terms of its symptomatic severity, is much milder than various acute illnesses, but in terms of health and happiness, it is far more painful than various acute illnesses. This is because acute illnesses such as typhoid fever, scarlet fever, meningitis, and appendicitis, while they come on violently and pose a threat to life, can be treated effectively, turning danger into safety within a few days without causing much suffering. Nocturnal emission, however, is quite different. While its sudden and violent onset is relatively rare, the damage it inflicts on the patient's health and the deprivation of youthful happiness are more severe than any acute or chronic illness.

Its most prominent symptoms are dizziness, headache, back pain, tinnitus, palpitations, weak memory, aversion to noise and preference for quiet, lack of courage and decisiveness, hesitation in the face of challenges, inability to concentrate, and a gradual decline in judgment and memory. For those who are engaged in writing, their literary inspiration often feels barren, and they are listless and dispirited all day long. However, these are just the most common general symptoms. If the patient has a pre-existing habit of masturbation or frequent emissions and still neglects to seek treatment, the resulting tragedy is even more unspeakable!

Semen is a vital glandular fluid that nourishes the entire body, while masturbation is a destructive act that damages the gonads and weakens the sperm gate. If repeated and becomes a habit, the sperm gate will relax, and nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea will inevitably erupt, affecting the sexual nerves and leading to various symptoms such as incomplete development, local underdevelopment, and premature ejaculation. Such patients, on the surface, may eat and excrete normally, but the pain in their hearts is truly beyond the comprehension of outsiders!

Effective treatment for this condition is not difficult in today's era of advanced medicine and therapeutics. As long as the patient is determined to abstain from masturbation and takes the reproductive gland preparation "Reproductin," allowing the reproductive glands to regain prosperity and enhancing the function of metabolism and continuous endocrine production, all symptoms of weakness will naturally disappear. However, those who have pre-existing nocturnal emission or spermatorrhea before taking the medication must simultaneously use "Hemitol Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" to strengthen their sperm gate, so that leakage is blocked and the nourishing effect can be manifested.

Beauty and Health

### Breast Development and Female Beauty

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chong-pei

Promoting Breast Development is the Only Secret to Creating Female Beauty

In a physiologically mature and well-developed state, every young woman should have a graceful and healthy figure. This figure includes a slender body, distinct curves, and, especially, prominent breasts that stand tall in a double-peaked formation. As for a face with fair and rosy skin, lively and spirited eyes, dark and cloud-like hair, and a smiling expression... that is, of course, also very important. In the past, we judged a woman's beauty solely based on her face, which is absolutely wrong! Because the face is only a small part of the whole body, a truly beautiful woman must have a healthy and beautiful physique in addition to a beautiful face. Therefore, women with poor development and fading complexions should no longer spend excessive effort on their faces. They must work from the root, that is, save some money on cosmetics and quickly purchase the ovarian preparation for women "Reproductin," which can not only promote developmental function and make the breasts stand tall but also help its metabolism, making the skin fresh and rosy, so that both body and face can be dazzlingly beautiful. Moreover, hidden ailments such as irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, frigidity, and infertility can be fundamentally cured, and there is hope for childbirth. With this good medicine, women can have the art of beauty and health, and have no worries about all diseases. Therefore, this medicine has long been popular all over the world, enjoying a high reputation, and is sold in all pharmacies.

Leukorrhea Forum
— Gonorrhea Specialist Dai De, M.D.

Clinic: Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road

Free Consultation, Only 4 Jiao for Registration Fee

### Why is Leukorrhea Difficult to Cure?

Taking Only Over-the-Counter Medicine, Of Course It's Difficult to Cure!

Relying Only on Superficial Medical Treatment, Especially Difficult to Cure!

The Unreliability of Taking Only Over-the-Counter Medicine. The most common and most difficult-to-cure disease in society is generally considered to be leukorrhea, a venereal disease. In fact, leukorrhea is not difficult to cure, but the reason why it is difficult to cure is that when patients are first infected, they experience burning in the urethra, frequent urination, pus discharge, and local swelling. At this time, they are anxious to seek treatment and often do not have time to choose carefully, relying only on the glaring advertisements in the newspaper, buying one or two boxes of over-the-counter medicine, and swallowing them privately. Initially, the disease seems to be slightly reduced, and they think that they can rest easy, but they do not know that they have made a big mistake. Gonococci sneak into the posterior urethra and gradually spread to the testicles, seminal vesicles, prostate, and other places, wreaking havoc. From then on, they take deep root and become chronic gonorrhea. This is a common mistake that patients make!

The Unreliability of Superficial Medical Treatment. Secondly, the lack of carefulness in medical treatment is also a major reason for the difficulty in curing this disease. Recently, science has become increasingly advanced, and medical equipment is also becoming more complete, but general city doctors still adhere to the old methods of ten years ago, using extremely simple equipment to examine patients, and then boast about their rich experience. They only do superficial work and go through the motions. How can leukorrhea be quickly cured in this way? This doctor has been practicing for more than ten years, and for the treatment of gonorrhea, in addition to equipping himself with the latest ultra-shortwave electrotherapy machine, theta-wave electrotherapy machine, urethral examination mirror, and bladder reflection mirror, as well as effective needles and medicines, he has also purchased at a high price the "German Filter-Lymphatic Flat-Flow Electrotherapy Machine" to add a unique touch to the treatment of gonorrhea in Shanghai. Whether it is new or old leukorrhea, this doctor carefully examines where the bacteria are located and treats them separately. He is confident that with such responsibility and such medication, what difficulty is there in curing leukorrhea?

Spring and Autumn

### China Apples

— (Ge Er)

Our "friendly nation" used to use "China apples" to lure their elementary school students when they were educating them, telling them that to eat "China apples," they must "conquer China." --This is a story that our teacher often told us when I was an elementary school student, meaning that we elementary school students should protect our "apples" and prevent others from invading them!

Now I am in my twenties, and those "elementary school students" in our "friendly nation" are of course the same age as me, and they are now putting into practice the "education" that their teachers gave them on weekdays, coming to China to eat "China apples."

But have they "eaten" them?

The answer is very disappointing for them: that is -- they have not eaten them, or, some have "eaten" them, but that will not last long. Because of this, they are eating very hastily. When they are "wolfing down" like this, they will certainly not think of a Chinese folk tale, which is the story of the greedy frog that burst its belly.

However, even though they have "eaten" them, and they are eating so hastily, after all, it is only a "small number" of "minorities"! The "majority" of people not only have not "eaten" them, but have lost their lives for those few "greedy frogs"! Therefore, those "duped" who have not yet lost their lives (I can only say "duped," and in fact, they are truly "duped"!) are beginning to doubt the "education" that their teachers taught them in childhood: "China apples" will not be "eaten" by us, what we have "eaten" is actually "China bullets"! And those who are eating "China apples" are not squatting on the corpses of our countless deceived "greedy people" eating? And they are eating so hastily, so greedily, regardless of the capacity of their stomachs, always "eating," "eating."... Yes, they also see that the result of those "minorities" "eating" is still not "eating," because they have "eaten" and burst their bellies, and the "apples" are unharmed!

Therefore, the newspaper has such news appearing.

First item: "Anti-war sentiment is rising in Japan. Small groups have been established in the invading Chinese army. There was once a mutiny in Dagu."...

Second item: "Anti-war slogans are posted all over the Nanshi Japanese naval shipyard. Because of the discovery of this situation, ideological inspections have been carried out on a large scale for days, so most of the Japanese workers have been transferred to the front lines."...

Third item: "Japanese people come to Shanghai to make a living, harboring extravagant hopes, but as a result, very few obtain jobs, so they have flocked to the job placement department of the Japanese Residents Association, thus causing the Residents Association to have difficulty coping!"...

Enough! Enough! If we wanted to extract such news items as the above since August 13th, we could compile a book, but enough! As long as we "hold on," the greedy frog's belly will burst one day!

### Calligraphy and Environment (Part 1)

— Li Xiao-bai

The environment of calligraphy. Its content is very broad. The "human" aspect. The "material" aspect. The temporal aspect. The human environment First, the father or brother in the family must understand calligraphy. (School education will be discussed in another article.) Because the most important thing about calligraphy is method and approach. How can methods be explored? How can approaches be found? It is necessary to rely on a qualified instructor to provide guidance. If the father or brother understands calligraphy, then the children will know how to hold the brush in calligraphy, how to arrange the environment, how to choose rubbings, what to start with first, and how to improve on them. What is the appropriate approach? What are the shortcomings? How should they be reformed? What are the advantages? How should they be encouraged? There are appropriate methods for separate facilities. This is what is commonly called "family learning origin." With a family learning origin, and then with the edification of a famous teacher and the mutual learning of good friends, even if one cannot become a master, at least one can enter the right path. Therefore, "the son of a good smith is always a good smith. The son of a good furrier is always a good furrier." The son of a good calligrapher is always a good calligrapher. Wang Xizhi and Wang Xianzhi, father and son, and Ouyang Xun and Ouyang Tong, father and son, are very obvious examples. And the sons of farmers, workers, and merchants often cannot excel in calligraphy because their father or brother has no research in calligraphy at all. Thus, whether the father or brother is good at calligraphy or not, and the quality of calligraphy, are they not of great importance? Secondly, one must have a good teacher. A teacher is one who teaches and solves doubts. Therefore, if we want to improve in our studies, we must rely on the guidance of a famous teacher to be successful. In the past, Zhong Yao taught Lady Wei, and Lady Wei taught Wang Xizhi. In recent times, from the founding of the Republic of China to the fifth year, Mr. Zai Ketang was in charge of teaching calligraphy at the First Normal School of Jiangsu Province. Mr. Wu Liangzhe was in charge of teaching calligraphy at the Second Normal School. At the Second Normal School, Mr. Hua Wan'an and Mr. Huang Danru were in charge of teaching calligraphy. At that time, the students of the three normal schools followed the trend. Talents emerged in large numbers. When they graduated and took up teaching positions, they were all able to cope with ease. And the elementary school students cultivated by these people all had a considerable level. As for the author, his family has been in business for generations, so there is no family learning to speak of. When I was studying at a private school, the teachers taught me to trace and copy and to copy rubbings. And the rubbings I copied were the rubbings of Huang Ziyuan that I bought from a book stall. The teachers did not comment and let it be. When I entered elementary school, the teachers had a higher level of calligraphy, but they were too subjective. Because they had benefited from Ouyang Xun's Nine-fold Palace Tablet, they used the Nine-fold Palace Tablet as the goal of calligraphy. They did not ask what the student's writing style was like. If the student changed to practice other rubbings, it was absolutely not allowed. It was strictly forbidden. But the author's writing style and the Nine-fold Palace were incompatible. It is funny to say that the more effort I put in, the more I felt like I was regressing. When I entered the normal school, the calligraphy teachers regarded the Regular Script as the Xuanmi Pagoda Tablet and the Running Script as the Preface to the Orchid Pavilion as gospel. Although I made some progress in the middle, I eventually stopped practicing from time to time because I had no confidence in holding the brush. After graduating and taking up a teaching position, I did not dare to have any hope for calligraphy. Therefore, I put the rubbings on the shelf. Unexpectedly, in the fifth year of the Republic of China, when I was teaching in Liangxi, there were many colleagues who were good at calligraphy and could write freely. I could not help but feel ashamed. I had to work hard myself. I was fortunate to have Mr. Yan Yaoqing, the Taifu, visit me from time to time. After tea and wine, he would always ask me about calligraphy. After his instructions, I was given rubbings. I suddenly saw the light. Mr. Yaoqing was a famous scholar in Xibei. Since I had received his favor, how could I not work harder? So I resolutely corrected my past mistakes and followed Mr. Yaoqing's policy in everything. Every night, when it was quiet, I would spread out paper, moisten the brush, and practice for two hours. In less than a year, the results were remarkable. This was the era of my environmental transformation. Up to now, I have achieved some success. When drinking water, I think of the source. I really cannot but give credit to Mr. Yaoqing. If I had not met Mr. Yaoqing at that time, I would have been groping in the dark, pulling from the east and grabbing from the west, without any target. Although I had the heart to practice seriously, but without appropriate methods and appropriate approaches, how could I have achieved anything? This is why a famous teacher is really indispensable in the study period. Secondly, one must have beneficial friends. "The foolish have a thousand thoughts, and must have one gain. The wise have a thousand thoughts, and must have one loss." Therefore, friends with rich knowledge are enough to benefit me. Even friends with a lack of knowledge have one gain in a thousand thoughts, which is enough to supplement my knowledge. The same is true of calligraphy. During conversations, one can often gain a smattering of knowledge. For example, Li Meiyang and Zeng Qingran in recent times. When they were in Peiping, they ate at the same table and slept in the same bed. They went out in the same car. What they usually discussed was nothing but calligraphy. The books they bought were nothing but fragments of rubbings. Once the rubbings were obtained, they explored them repeatedly and discussed them repeatedly. As a result, they surged upwards to the Yin and Zhou Dynasties and downwards to the Ming and Qing Dynasties. They knew everything like the back of their hands. As a result, they divided into two schools, north and south, each establishing its own banner. They developed what the predecessors had not developed and added a unique touch to the calligraphy world. This is a clear proof that practicing calligraphy must have good friends. I once said that good friends are sometimes better than good teachers. This is what I mean. If Zeng had not befriended Li, his accomplishments might not have been so profound. And in the world, there are probably countless people with the calligraphy talents of Zeng and Li, but because they have no good friends to learn from each other, their accomplishments are limited, or even without any achievement. Is this not a pity? The relationship between good friends and calligraphy is of great importance.

### Saintly Hero Eliminates the Wicked

— Bai Hua

"The Saint in New York"

Produced by RKO Pictures, Showing at the Grand Shanghai Theater

We have seen many G-Men movies. The battles between detectives and bandits, the machine-gun fire, when these tense scenes are shown on the screen, they really give the audience who paid seventy cents a great satisfaction, and characters like Edward G. Robinson are also deeply imprinted on the audience's minds, but every audience also ignores the crisis lurking behind the prosperity of the gold-dollar country. Although they use this kind of film as a sign of "social stability," is "society" "stable" just because a bandit has been captured and a bandit's den has been destroyed? This kind of "attempt to cover up" is of course counterproductive.

Although "Saintly Hero Eliminates the Wicked" is slightly different from those G-Men movies, it is about how a "hero" calmly and unhurriedly cracks down on a gang of bandits. This writing style seems to be more clever than the former, because that "hero" is not only "brave and agile" but also a "master of flirting." For example, in "The Gay Parisian" which was also shown in the same theater, Francis Lederer and Louis Hayward are equally suave -- using this posture to eliminate treacherous bandits naturally makes the audience more sympathetic than a ruthless detective. But what is the result? This "representation" is still a failure, as "Saintly Hero Eliminates the Wicked" tells the audience that the leader of the bandit gang is actually the "Chairman of the Citizens' Public Safety Maintenance Association." However, it must be said that the murder of Vakros, the "Chairman of the Citizens' Public Safety Maintenance Association," illustrates a part of the reason for the "rampancy of bandits." To "stabilize society," it is indeed necessary to "change" this "society." But letting a character similar to the "Chairman of the Citizens' Public Safety Maintenance Association" show his face is also not without some help.

"Saintly Hero Eliminates the Wicked" is said to be a detective novel that has recently become popular. The author is Leslie Charteris, and he is also the authority of modern mystery novelists. Therefore, this "Saintly Hero" Simon Templar is also very "mysterious," such as entering a gambling den bare-handed, etc. He is truly a character only found in detective novels.

Simon's shooting of Epal, the director's introduction to his first achievement, is very good: after Epal was shot, people gathered around the street. In the crowd, a black-clad monk was inspecting the dead, and finally he left sadly. This monk, who only saw his back, saw Simon and Vakros in the next scene, and Simon was just taking off his clothes; and when Simon was captured by Hemy and Leder, after the light was turned off and they fought, he jumped out of the window, but the partisans below had heard the sound and searched. Simon climbed to the roof. In these places, the director is quite clever.

Louis Hayward is very good at acting. His eyebrows, eyes, and cheek muscles are all expressive.

Chapter 3: Admiring the Portrait and Remembering the Old Martyr, Opening a Literacy Class with a Little Teacher

As they were talking, they suddenly heard someone at the next table calling out, "Sister Dan-yun! Sister Dan-yun!" Jin Dan-yun looked back and recognized her classmate Ms. Wu Jun-su. She asked, "Why are you in Shanghai?" Wu Jun-su said, "I came yesterday and will be going back tomorrow, so I don't have time to see you." Jin Dan-yun looked over and saw three or four female companions together. Some she recognized, and some she didn't. It turned out that Ms. Wu Jun-su was also an old classmate of Jin Dan-yun. She is currently a professor at Soochow University in Suzhou and is a writer. Because her family lives in Shanghai, she often comes to Shanghai on Sundays. When they were classmates, she and Jin Dan-yun were the closest, so she came over. Lin Jian-cheng had met her before, but he had not met the two Ms. He. Jin Dan-yun could not help but introduce them to each other and asked, "When are you going back tomorrow?" Wu Jun-su said, "I'm going back in the morning, because I have a class in the afternoon at school." Jin Dan-yun said, "That's great. These two He sisters are also going to Suzhou tomorrow, so you can travel together. These two sisters have come to Shanghai for the first time and have not traveled to various places in Suzhou. Originally, I wanted to accompany them to travel around, but I am bound by my duties. Sister Jun-su! What time train are you taking tomorrow? If you travel with them, you can point out the scenery of Jiangnan along the way, which would be great." Wu Jun-su said, "I'm taking the express train at nine o'clock in the morning. If the two sisters also take this train, we'll have company on the train. Sister Dan-yun! Don't worry! I'll be a tour guide today, taking on your responsibility. When we get to Suzhou, I can accompany the two sisters to see various places. It's just that I have two hours of class in the afternoon." Jin Dan-yun said, "There's no need to accompany them on their travels. I know you're also very busy. Moreover, after passing through Suzhou, they're going to Freedom Village. They've made an appointment, and maybe Zhu Ai-ren is coming to Suzhou to pick them up." Wu Jun-su said, "Oh! Is that the female doctor Zhu Ai-ren? I know her too. Our school invited her to give a lecture on children's hygiene knowledge, which was very clear. Well then, if Dr. Zhu comes, that would be great; if Dr. Zhu doesn't come, I'll take the two sisters to Freedom Village." The two Ms. He thanked her for her kindness and agreed to take the express train at nine o'clock in the morning tomorrow. When they were about to leave, they said again, "In that case, let's meet on the train tomorrow!" (35)

### Isolated Island Chrysanthemum Talk

— Wang Weiwo

——Starting with Luck and Misfortune——

Actors also experience luck and misfortune. Zhou Xinfang (Qilin Bao), with his hoarse voice, has surprisingly become so famous. Although Xinfang's success was not accidental, the decision to promote or not promote him was not without influence.

In the early years, Zhou Xinfang was not the only actor in Shanghai who could earn money. Bai Yukun, Yang Ruiting, Gai Jiaotian, and Zhao Junyu were all once very popular. But now, Bai Yukun and Zhao Junyu have gone to other places and are languishing in obscurity. Yang Ruiting has almost been reduced to a second-rate role. Although Gai Jiaotian's heroic bearing is undiminished, his fall on the stage of the Great Theater ultimately affected his skills, and compared to his heyday, there is a feeling of past and present. Only Xinfang can sing more vigorously day by day and firmly sit in the leading position among the actors of Jiangnan. This cannot be said to be luck and misfortune.

Taking the above few people as examples, Zhao Junyu is not worth discussing. Bai Yukun, Yang Ruiting, and Gai Jiaotian are all righteous martial male roles. The general martial male actors who have risen in Jiangnan have always learned from these three. (Take Wang Huchen and Gao Xueqiao, who have been the most famous in Jiangnan in the past ten years, for example, Wang Huchen learned from Bai Yukun, and Gao Xueqiao learned from Gai Jiaotian.) In theory, these three have become typical figures and should have had their livelihoods secured for life. Why, except for Gai Jiaotian, who can still command attention due to historical and environmental reasons, are Bai Yukun and Yang Ruiting without an audience? There is a very understandable answer: "Things must rot from within before insects breed."

Bai Yukun's spear and Yang Ruiting's legs are second to none in Jiangnan. Unfortunately, in recent years, both of them have made the mistake of being "lazy," so that when watching Bai Yukun's play, one cannot see Bai Yukun's spear; when watching Yang Ruiting's play, one cannot see Yang Ruiting's legs. How can this satisfy the audience? If actors cannot satisfy the audience, can they still be popular? Speaking of the two's art, they are both first-class talents in both civil and martial arts. Bai Laojiu is relatively unfortunate because he was unwilling to condescend like Yang Ruiting. After leaving the Gong Wutai, he went to Yantai to open a wharf. Yang Ruiting, on the other hand, has not joined a long-term troupe for the past one or two years. Now I heard that he has been hired by Gong Wutai. After Yang Laosi enters Gong Wutai, perhaps under the control of the environment, he will not allow those younger heroes to be beautiful in front of him, and he will grit his teeth and fight. If his teeth can always be clenched, perhaps luck can therefore have a turning point.

Zhao Tongzha (Furong Cao) is one of the lucky actors. Although he plays with the four famous Dan actors, he can hear about the same amount of money as the four famous Dan actors. In fact, this is not because Tong Yang's horoscope is good. The only reason is that he is not lazy in acting. So I dare to say very arbitrarily that luck and misfortune have a very close relationship with laziness and diligence.

Look at Lin Shusen! During his time at Rongji Great Theater, he held a prominent position, and his plays were sometimes even ahead of Gao Xueqiao's. When Jing opera actors performed at the Great Theater, Lin Shusen sang all the odd jobs. When Rongji Great Theater was renovated, Lin Laosan hung up the third sign at Gong Wutai and sang with Yun Yanxia and Zhang Ruting for a while. After leaving Gong Wutai, he did not perform in Shanghai for three years. The year before last, he appeared on the same stage with Gai Jiaotian at the Gengxin Theater and suddenly became a first-class popular actor. Half of this is of course due to Shulin's efforts, but in the final analysis, it is still because Shulin is serious about acting. Shulin's skills are not as good as Yukun and Ruiting, but he is not as lazy as them, so the current Sen Shusen is more valuable than Bai Yukun and Yang Ruiting.

There is a martial male actor named Wang Shaolou at Gong Wutai. This gentleman has been performing in Hangzhou. After coming to Shanghai, he became popular because of his "aggressive" performance, and he invisibly overwhelmed Gao Xueqiao, who has a long history in Shanghai and a solid reputation. In fact, in terms of art, Shaolou has occupied Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou for a long time, and his art is close to the wild. Although Xueqiao is overseas, he is ultimately better than Helou. Now Shaolou's reputation is even higher than Xueqiao's. This cannot be said to be luck and misfortune.

### A Brief Description of Hong Kong Film Company Productions in the Past Year (Part 1)

— Nie Ge, sent from Hong Kong

Since the full-scale War of Resistance against Japan, Hong Kong, being a place outside the war zone, has seen a daily increase in the number of people seeking refuge here, more than doubling the population. As a result, the entertainment industry has flourished even more, and the film industry in particular is like bamboo shoots after the rain. The number of new companies is very large, but most of them are engaged in speculation and profit-seeking, and have no conscience. The films they make either appeal to the audience with eroticism and sensuality, or are based on folk tales of young masters and beautiful ladies. The level of knowledge of the indigenous residents of Hong Kong is originally very low, and these films cater to their tastes. Although the media has been calling for improvement, the filmmakers turn a deaf ear. Moreover, Hong Kong's laws are particularly strict. If a film is severely criticized, even if it is justified and reasonable, the defendant will mostly fail once the filmmaker files a lawsuit. Therefore, writers dare not write as they please and launch a major attack. This is also one of the reasons why Hong Kong films cannot be improved. Although there are also patriotic films that meet the needs of the War of Resistance, they are few and far between. The following is a brief description of the film production situation of various film companies in Hong Kong in the past year. Due to space limitations, I cannot analyze the content of each film, so I will only list the film titles. It is not difficult to imagine its contents by looking at the film titles:

Nanyue Company: This company was founded by Zhu Qingxian. The company’s sound films, recorded using self-made Qingxian-style radios, are the best among Hong Kong companies. The products are most popular. A total of eleven films were produced in the past year, including "Seeing the Sun Again," "Seven Stars Accompany the Moon," "Romantic Rich Man," "Compatriot Brothers," "Plum Blossom Twice," "Rouge Tears" (Cantonese copy, also starring Hu Die, filmed simultaneously with Mandarin), "Magistrate Mei," "Ghost Domain" (Vietnamese film, exclusively shown in Annam), "Eighth Heaven," "General Peach Blossom," and "Wonderful Woman." The filming of "Peach and Plum Competing for Spring," starring Xue Juesheng, is underway.

Nanyang Company: This company is currently headed by Shao Cunren, the second brother of Shao Zuiweng of Tianyi Company. It is one of the Hong Kong film companies with the highest output last year, with a total of 21 films, including "Double Happiness," "Flying General of Dragon City," "Storms on the Pacific," "Spendthrift Son," "Rickshaw Humiliation," "Woman's Sutra," "Broken Ganoderma," "Film World Romance," "Purple Rosy Cup," "Female Warrior," "Three Mothers Drawing Water," "June Snow," "Bittersweet," "Sacrificing Son to Serve Mother-in-law," "Pipa Ballad," "Camera Demon," "Roaring Winds and Clouds," "Night Light Cup," "Soul-Stealing Sister," "Liu Manling," and "Flirty Mouth." The new films being filmed include "Romantic Hell" and "Modern Idiot."

### Rare News from the Entertainment World

Wang Fuying, a martial male actor from Gong Wutai, has resigned from the troupe with a very firm determination. The troupe has invited Yuan Xiaolou, a martial male actor who recently returned to Shanghai from Qingdao. The deposit was paid in full last night, and he will join the rehearsals starting tonight.

The Carlton Grand Theatre's Yifeng Drama Society is scheduled to distribute the January salaries on the 11th and start rehearsing the new play "Eminent Scholar Wen Su Chen" on the 13th. The scenery and colored ribbons are already being rushed to completion.

The New World Amusement Park has announced that the night show on the 10th will be the last performance of the year.

The Lianyou Drama Society of the Great World has scheduled the repertoire for January of the Yimao year, and plans to perform four new plays: "Great Luck and Prosperity," "Living God of Wealth," "Modern Eight Immortals," and "Ghost," and will also revive the famous play "The Secretary's Wife."

Sun Pengzhi, a veteran civil and martial actor, intends to leave the Tianchan Stage and transfer to the Cadillac Theater next spring, but the Tianchan authorities are firmly trying to retain him and refuse to let go. Negotiations are still ongoing. Kun Dan (female role) Jin Suwen is scheduled to host a banquet at the Great Samsung tonight for Zhou Jihua, Wu Tianchang, Hu Tiwei, and others from the Carlton Grand Theatre.

### Flower Welcoming Spring Performed at Da Luotian

### A Women's Issues Play to be Staged

The Shanghai Amateur Drama Association's fourth public performance is scheduled for 10:00 AM on the 12th at the Green Reality Theater. The plays will be "Little Husband," "Awakening," and "The Third Miss's Profession." These three one-act plays are based on the current women's issues in China and were written successively by Zhang Min, Gong Min, You Jing, and others. The plots are lively and are all "Bitter Laixi Ge."

(1) "Little Husband" writes about the bad habit of "valuing men over women" in the old society, and describes the tragic experiences of women in the old society with a satirical and spicy tone.

(2) "Awakening" writes about the life of a female writer, and has a flavor of Ibsen's "Nora."

(3) "The Third Miss's Profession" uses a common story in a metropolis to raise the seriousness of the current women's employment issue.

This time, the Association is staging these three major "women's issues" plays with the most cautious attitude and the most meticulous rehearsals. The performance results can be expected.

### Yiyou Drama Troupe to Perform "Thunderstorm"

Recently, the "isolated island" situation has become very "unisolated," especially in the theater world. It is heard that on February 13th and 12th, the Yiyou Drama Troupe, a legitimate entertainment group with more than 2,000 young friends, will also perform "Thunderstorm" at the Golden Grand Theatre.

Mr. Wu Zhi, the director of "The Beginning of Man," is directing "Thunderstorm" this time, which is good news for the audience who likes opera. We can imagine that the performance of "Thunderstorm" will not disappoint us by the results of the performance of "The Beginning of Man". As for actors such as Zhang Jie, Chen Zhong, Yi Li, Man Wu, Wu Jing, Ye Lu, etc., they all have a not short theatrical history, and they have been well received in Qingdao and Shanghai Drama Art Society and other performances such as "Women's Apartment" and "The Struggle of Love and Death".

From Cannon Two to Five to the Red side's Horse Two Advance Three, both sides are opening official moves that have been explained before, Pawn Five Advance One, a powerful charge, competing for the lead with the central cannon, the main method, Scholar Four Advance Five, a supplemental move, then Pawn Five Advance One across the river, the purpose is to disrupt the opponent's line, ensuring that the opponent's central pawn cannot exist safely, because the central pawn is the first gate to protect the screen, removing the central pawn allows the Chariot advancing Six to gain momentum, while attacking the middle road, the men and horses can also take advantage of the momentum to advance, which is the urgent method of advancing the central cannon, Cannon Two Advance One to defend important roads, watching how the opponent advances, Pawn Five to Four leave the pawn, Pawn Seven Advance One to attack the chariot and capture the pawn, Pawn Four Advance One leave the pawn, Horse Three Advance Four to capture the pawn, Chariot Two to Three to capture the horse, Chariot One Advance Two to protect the horse, at this time the black side has lost the momentum, the reason is that Pawn Five to Four is to leave the pawn, the result is that the pawn cannot be left, and the opponent's central pawn is still there, which is harmful to oneself and beneficial to the other, which is a taboo of strategists, this is one of the reasons for losing momentum, injuring the central pawn without any cost, but losing the effectiveness of the four advances, this is the second reason for losing momentum, after losing the pawn, if calculated by the number of steps, the black side who moves first only has five steps, while the red side who moves later has as many as nine steps, all of these are called losing the initiative, the black side's Pawn Five to Four changes to the method of moving in the twelfth round, then it will not lose the initiative,

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (101)

— Xu Muyun

Two Male Leads, Two Female Leads, and Two Painted Faces Truly Fighting and Cursing Over a Play's Envy

When San Xiaobai performed at Tianchan at the same time in the eighth year of the Republic of China, the roles were very complete. San Xiao refers to Yang Xiaolou, Tan Xiaopei, and Shang Xiaoyun. Yi Bai refers to Bai Mudan, whose current name is Xun Pingsheng. At that time, Xiaoyun's reputation was much higher than Huisheng's, but the two's routes to singing female roles were completely different. Shang was a Zheng Gong Qingyi (serious female role), and Xun was a Hua Dan (vivacious female role) and Dao Ma Dan (female warrior role). At that time, although the term "Four Famous Dan" had not yet been established, the city of Beijing already had four groups of supporters for the roles: Mei (poison), Huang (disease), Shang (party), and Bai (society), which were the same as the popular terms in society. In the past twenty years, one of the four, Huang Runqing, has fallen, and one, Cheng Yanqiu, has emerged, and the one who has filled this vacancy is exactly the second place. The only difference is that Xiaoyun has been reduced to the rear, but Huisheng has climbed to the top of Xiaoyun. Speaking of the reasons for the reversal of Shang and Xun's ranking, it has something to do with this quarrel and Xiaoyun's arrogance. It can be seen that the most important thing for an actor is popularity, and the skill is secondary.

One day, the playbill was "Hong Ni Pass," co-performed by Shang and Xun. Xiaoyun played Dongfang, who was originally the more important role. Later, it is unknown from which famous Dan it originated, but the maid in the second book became the main role, and Dongfang was reduced to a supporting role. Of course, the maid had a large section of Erliu Ban, which was very exciting, but Dongfang's "thinking of spring" scene was also very difficult to perform. Moreover, the person who played this role before had to sing a slow Ban Xi Pi, unlike the simple Yuan Ban that is sung now after being reduced to a supporting role. This time, Huisheng and Xiaoyun sang this play together, and naturally Shang was the main and Xun was the secondary, according to the price and role of the two at the time. However, Huisheng came to the South for the first time at that time, and he also had his uncle Wu Caixia to help him, so naturally he was serious about acting everywhere. Moreover, he was born with fair skin and a handsome appearance. He was originally a Bangzi Hua Dan, so he naturally had a deep understanding of this kind of lascivious clothing. He could really make the audience under the stage lose their minds, so the applause continued one after another without interruption. When Xiaoyun's maid appeared, she simply did not receive any good response. Xiaoyun was originally a proud temper who called himself Shang Wangye (it is said that his superior was some kind of hereditary prince among the Manchus). Today, he was going to play the main role, but before the main role appeared, the thunderous applause kept ringing. When he came out, it was silent. How could he endure it? So he scolded Huisheng at that time, making Xun Huisheng utterly confused.
