Berlin: The Commander-in-Chief recently released a public statement saying that the Corps Commander, former Chief of the Army General Fritsch, has died in action near Warsaw. Führer Hitler has issued a special order for commendation and decided to hold a state funeral to console his loyal spirit. It is noted that General Fritsch was dismissed from his post along with former Minister of Defense General von Blomberg on February of last year, and only recently was appointed as Corps Commander.

Warsaw: Colonel Lis-Błoński, commander of the Warsaw Defense Forces, issued a war report last night, stating, "Our forces are still resisting superior enemy forces in the three cities of Warsaw, Modlin, and Ławrusza. The German claims that the Polish army has been routed and that many have been captured by their troops are completely unfounded. Our Central Army, led by General Podhorski, is engaged in fierce battles with the enemy near the two cities of Warsaw and Modlin, the intensity of which is unprecedented since the start of the war. The Southern Army, led by General Piekarski, is fighting bravely in the city of Ławrusza. Both armies maintain close contact with the Warsaw garrison." (Havas Telegram from the 23rd)

Berlin: According to reports received here today, foreigners residing in Warsaw began to evacuate yesterday.

Three hundred foreigners then left Warsaw under the escort of German officers and representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Diplomatic representatives of various countries residing in Warsaw all evacuated by car under escort. Other foreigners will leave on three special trains via Königsberg. (Associated Press Telegram from the 23rd)

Berlin: Germany believes that the Polish war has, in fact, come to an end, and a large number of troops are now being transferred westward. It is reported that, up to now, as many as seventy German divisions have been concentrated on the Western Front. In other words, there are already 1.5 million men. The German side is still continuously reinforcing the Western Front. According to news here, since the start of the war, the fighting on the Western Front has been limited to the "no man's land" between the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line. Advanced units of the French army are being swept by machine gun positions and killed by landminefields. These landmines are all electrically detonated. (Associated Press Telegram from the 23rd)

Paris: Intelligence Director Giraudoux, in a broadcast speech last night, stated that although only three weeks have passed since the German army began operations inside Poland, the number of officers and soldiers killed, wounded, and captured has reached as many as 150,000. The number of German aircraft shot down is in the range of six to seven hundred. The large quantities of military supplies stored by them that were destroyed or seized by the Polish army are countless. (Havas Telegram from the 22nd)

Berlin: The semi-official German News Agency recently released a message, briefly stating that Führer Hitler had gone to the Narew River basin of the Bug River in Poland to inspect the area of operations between the German and Polish armies in the past week, and climbed a mountain to view the situation of the siege of the city of Warsaw, before returning to headquarters. (Havas Telegram from the 22nd)

Berlin: General Headquarters recently released a war report from the Western Front, stating, "There was prolonged artillery fire in many places along the front lines. Several aircraft from both enemy and our sides engaged in aerial combat near the city of Saarlouis. One enemy aircraft was forced to land, and several crew members were captured by our forces. Our forces also lost one aircraft." (Havas Telegram from the 23rd)

The Hague: A guest from Warsaw recently said that the German army's attack on Warsaw has not yet succeeded. It is heard that the German military authorities are deeply concerned that if the defending forces engage in street fighting when the city falls, the German army will inevitably suffer heavy losses, and therefore are hesitant and have not yet launched a full-scale attack. (Havas Telegram from the 22nd)

Paris: General Headquarters recently released War Report No. 38, stating, "In the evening yesterday, enemy forces repeatedly attacked positions held by our forces on the east bank of the Saar River and were repelled. Last night, fighting also broke out along the entire line, especially between the Saar River and the city of 'Deux-Ponts,' and along the Lauter River." (Havas Telegram from the 23rd)

Paris: The situation on the Western Front has become tense after British and German air forces clashed over the Siegfried Line yesterday, followed by mutual artillery fire. An official report from London last night stated that one German aircraft was shot down. No British losses were mentioned. A French communiqué stated that although there was artillery fire on the Western Front, it was generally calm, and there was no progress on either the German or French side. The German army, fearing a French attack, has concentrated a large number of troops in the Blies region and in the forests southeast of Saarlouis. The former is the easiest place for the French army to attack the Siegfried Line, and the latter is the area where French artillery fire is most intense. Authoritative sources here indicate that as the Eastern Front war is coming to an end, a large number of German reinforcements have been sent to the Western Front to join the fighting. However, before the war in Poland is completely over, the full-scale war on the Western Front has not yet reached the point of launching. The French Minister of Information broadcast on the radio last night, stating that German casualties have reached 150,000, 900 aircraft have been destroyed, and 600 pilots have been killed or wounded. The German army has suffered heavy damage in the Polish campaign. The situation for the French army this week is far superior to the situation three weeks after the start of the previous Great War. In the first twenty days of the previous Great War, the country had already lost important steel, coal, oil, and sugar producing areas. Today, France's mobilization has reached 100%. What Germany has gained in Poland is not enough to compensate for what it has lost. (Associated Press Telegram from the 23rd)

Berlin: According to reports from Führer Hitler's headquarters, Hitler took his private plane yesterday, flew through Danzig and East Prussia to inspect the German front lines north of Warsaw. Hitler toured the German troops around Warsaw, and the officers and soldiers were extremely excited wherever he went. (Haitong Telegram from the 23rd)

Beijing: Many believe that a first great war on the Western Front is now imminent. According to Belgian sources, Germans in Berlin are convinced that after General von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, arrives in the Saar region, the German army will soon launch a resolute attack. Troops, aircraft, tanks, and other mechanized units are continuously rushing from Poland and the German interior to the Western Front. Judging from various signs, the German army will try to drive back the French army as soon as possible. Currently, the Western Front is quiet except for occasional artillery bombardment between the two armies. It is heard that French sentries are active in the areas south of Saarlouis and east of the Blies River. The Blies River is a small river east of Saarlouis, winding through densely forested mountains. The riverbed is quite deep. According to recent French war reports, the entire line is quiet all day long. The French Navy continues to escort convoys and repel enemy submarines. (Reuters Telegram from the 23rd)

Basel, Switzerland: According to reliable sources, the basements in the German Siegfried Line where troops are stationed are not only damp, but the ventilation equipment is also not good. In addition, the food is poor. Soldiers suffering from rheumatism, throat problems, and stomach problems already account for 25% of the total number of soldiers. (Havas Telegram from the 22nd)

Paris: According to news here today, the German Commander-in-Chief, because Hitler came to inspect the Siegfried Line, specially ordered a fierce bombardment along the entire Saar region last night, followed by an infantry attack east of the Saar, to show a welcome to the Führer's arrival. (Associated Press Telegram from the 23rd)

London: On the Western Front, the activities of Allied aircraft are greatly hindered due to dense fog. However, the British and French air forces continue to scout the rear areas of the German army without slackening. Today, French newspapers all carried photos of a new type of small tank. These vehicles can be transported in large numbers to any dangerous location by a specially built truck. According to travelers from Germany, the German authorities are now propagandizing to their people that France does not want to go to war with Germany, but is merely a slave to British imperialism. (Reuters Telegram from the 23rd)

Paris: The German army is still heavily defending all points leading to Saarlouis. In the area in front of and on both sides of the mountains held by the French army in that area, there are now contact battles between French and German troops. The German army seems to want to test the strength of the French positions. Contact also occurred within the municipality of Hornbach on the left bank of the Blies River in the past 24 hours.

### Germany Makes Major Concessions to the Soviet Union Due to Tensions on the Western Front, Intending to Obtain Economic Assistance; Germany Transfers Lviv to the Soviet Union

London: According to reports of the German-Soviet partition of Poland, Germany's gains are the lands in Prussia after the three countries of Prussia, Russia, and Austria divided Poland 150 years ago, and part of the land occupied by Austria. The Soviet Union's share includes the three provinces currently occupied by Germany, all of the Galician oil fields, and the ability to effectively block the Hungarian border. Germany's decision to make such vigorous concessions shows its concerns about the British and French offensives and its urgent need to transfer the largest possible number of troops to the Western Front. It is rumored that right-wing elements in Germany are quite alarmed by the invisible cancellation of the plan to establish a buffer state in Poland, fearing that communism may invade Germany. Since Hitler arrived at the Warsaw front, the German side has once again threatened direly through radio broadcasts, claiming that if Warsaw does not surrender again, civilians, women, and children will be bombed. However, many believe that the German generals do not dare to resort to such cruel methods, for fear of causing a bad impression among the neutral countries, especially the United States, leading to President Roosevelt's modification of the Neutrality Act gaining final victory. (Reuters Telegram from the 23rd)

Berlin: According to well-informed sources here, the German-Soviet border within Poland was agreed upon before Germany adopted a military plan for Poland. Germany's decision on this border was not aimed at occupying as much Polish land as possible, but at annihilating the Polish army as quickly as possible. According to official sources, the troops on the border are now being transferred in an orderly manner. The Red Army is now taking over the area occupied by the German army in Lviv, a key town in southeastern Poland. (Reuters Telegram from the 23rd)

Moscow: Several German officers came here yesterday to discuss with the Soviet authorities the issue of demarcating the border between the two sides in Poland. An agreement has been reached, and this has been confirmed by well-informed sources. According to diplomatic circles, this agreement is in the Soviet Union's favor. Soviet troops have already advanced into the key cities of Vilnius, Brest-Litovsk, Lviv, and Stanislav, covering a total area of one-third of the entire territory of Poland, with a population of over 11.1 million, and their position is extremely strong. Germany is eager to maintain good relations with them in order to quickly withdraw its troops and go to the Western Front to fight. However, at the same time, because it is adjacent to the Soviet Union, it has to leave a large army in Poland to guard against emergencies. According to foreign observers here, the Soviet Union is now presenting itself as the protector of the Polish people, and this trend is clearly visible. (Havas Telegram from the 22nd)

Moscow: Today, all newspapers here prominently published reports on the situation in western Ukraine and western Belarus. It is said that the Soviet authorities are extremely active in the occupied areas. Temporary administrative organs are being organized, and their main task is to restore normal economic and cultural life. Radio stations and newspapers have also mostly resumed operations, and Russian and Ukrainian newspapers are being published in several cities. (Haitong Telegram from the 23rd)

Berlin: Haitong News Agency learned from senior authoritative sources about the clarification of the supplementary official report as follows: "The border delineated by the governments of Germany and the Soviet Union is extremely simple and clear. The 1,200-kilometer border, starting from the East Prussian border, along the Pisa, Vistula, Narew, and Bug rivers to the Carpathian Mountains from north to south, is entirely delineated according to natural geography and does not require any negotiations. This border delineation agreement was not negotiated at this time, but was understood as early as when the Russian army advanced into Poland. Therefore, in the Moscow border delineation meeting, German and Russian officials only discussed some details and reached a complete agreement in a few hours." (Haitong Telegram from the 22nd)

Cernăuți, Romania: News has just been received here from Poland that Germany and the Soviet Union are currently discussing the establishment of a buffer state within Poland. In addition, since the German army advanced into western Poland, the number of ethnic minorities in Germany has doubled compared to before. (Havas News Agency Telegram from the 22nd)

Moscow: After the governments of Germany and the Soviet Union jointly issued a communiqué yesterday, delineating the boundaries of their occupied areas within Poland, the general public here was initially surprised by the Soviet Union's huge gains. Now that the Soviet Union is connected to Germany in the south of East Prussia and to Hungary and Slovakia, while Germany is far apart from Romania due to the Soviet Union's occupation of southern Poland, the Balkan Peninsula has been controlled by the Soviet Union. Although Germany wants to threaten the countries along the Black Sea, it is fundamentally impossible. In other words, the Soviet Union has maintained a strong position in Central Europe, and Germany's influence has to turn westward. As for Germany's concessions to the Soviet Union, it is to seek economic and industrial assistance from the Soviet Union. Many German experts have now arrived here to assist the Soviet Union in developing industry and promoting general production. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet government's dispatch of troops to Poland this time has indeed gained great benefits. It is not certain whether Germany has also gained great benefits, because judging from the border delineated by the governments of Germany and the Soviet Union yesterday, what the Soviet Union has gained includes the towns near Warsaw, as well as the famous cities of Lviv, Białystok, and Lublin. The oil fields of eastern Galicia are also completely in their grasp. This is truly beyond what the Soviet Union originally expected. (Havas Telegram from the 23rd)

Berlin: According to news here today, Lviv surrendered to the German side yesterday, and then the city was handed over to the Soviet Union because Soviet troops arrived. The war in Galicia has now come to an end. It is heard that since the start of the war, the German side has captured 103,000 Polish soldiers in Galicia, seizing 252 light guns, 23 heavy guns, 37 armored vehicles, as well as a large number of military supplies and war materials. (Associated Press Telegram from the 23rd)

Moscow: According to news here today, the Polish 6th Infantry Division and 2 Independent Brigades led by General Langer in the Lviv region have surrendered to the Red Army. Up to now, the Red Army has captured a total of 120,000 Polish soldiers, 380 guns, and 400 machine guns, while occupying the Białystok fortress, Brest-Litovsk, and the forest northwest of Grodno, and the Sarny region. (Associated Press Telegram from the 23rd)

### Red Army War Report: Number of Captured Polish Officers and Soldiers Reaches 120,000

Moscow: The General Staff of the Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Red Army released the following war report for the 22nd: "On September 22, units of the Red Army operating in western Belarus occupied the town of Białystok and the Brest-Litovsk fortress, and began to clear out the defeated Polish troops in the Augustów Forest northwest of Grodno. The Red Army units engaged in sweeping out the defeated Polish troops in western Ukraine cleared out the officer corps in the Sarny area. The Polish 6th Infantry Division and 2 Independent Brigades led by General Langer surrendered today. Breaking through the Polish resistance in the Leish region, the Red Army's dangerous force, according to incomplete statistics, from September 17 to 21, the Red Army captured a total of 120,000 Polish officers and soldiers, seizing 380 guns and 1,400 machine guns." (TASS Telegram from the 23rd)

### German War Report: Polish General Captured

Berlin: Today's communiqué from the German High Command stated that the enemy forces in Lviv have surrendered. As a result of the German army's search in the forest near Borova, Polish General Bortnowski and his staff were all captured. On the Western Front, artillery fire occurred in only a few places and was not intense. Over Saarbrücken, one French aircraft was shot down by German anti-aircraft guns, and the personnel in the aircraft were captured. One German aircraft was also shot down by the enemy during aerial combat. (Haitong Telegram from the 23rd)

### Estonian Foreign Minister to Visit the Soviet Union to Guarantee Strict Neutrality

Moscow: Official sources released news yesterday stating that the Tallinn authorities in Estonia allowed a Polish submarine to escape, casting doubt on the reliability of the country's neutral attitude. Rumors immediately spread that Estonian Foreign Minister Selter would come here tomorrow to hold talks with the Soviet authorities. This news was recently confirmed by the Estonian embassy in the Soviet Union. Although Soviet officials have not made any statements on this matter, the general public believes that Foreign Minister Selter's visit is to solemnly guarantee to the Soviet government that it will strictly maintain neutrality in the European war. Foreigners here firmly believe that the Soviet Union has already regarded Estonia as a protectorate. Even if it does not occupy the Tallinn port and the small islands in the north of the country, as well as the Worsserdago Archipelago, it should at least disarm them. Since the Estonian authorities strengthened their defenses in the Worsserdago Archipelago, the Soviet government has been deeply concerned and has constantly criticized them in the newspapers, believing that this defense is beneficial to Germany. Now, the Soviet Union will definitely control Estonia's territorial waters and ports. It is said that although the goal is not to block the submarines of the United Kingdom and France, it is also to strengthen defenses to deal with Germany. On the German side, it is impossible to raise any objections. The issue of the defense of these islands was discussed by the representatives of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union during talks in Moscow earlier. (Havas Telegram from the 23rd)

The Hague: According to news from Dortmund in western Germany, the German government recently ordered the mobilization of the reserves of the 1906, 1907, and 1910 classes, as well as the reserves of the 1913 and 1920 classes who have not yet been called up, to join the army for service. (Havas Telegram from the 23rd)

London - The Anglo-French Supreme Defense Committee, following a joint meeting held in France on the 14th of this month, convened again today in a city in Sussex, England. Attendees on the British side were Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Minister for Coordination of Defence Admiral Chatfield. On the French side were Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier, Minister of Armaments Tautel, Supreme Commander of National Defense General Gamelin, and Vice Admiral Darlan, Chief of Naval Staff. The French representatives arrived at a city in southern England by special plane in the morning and proceeded to Sussex, where they immediately held a meeting with the British cabinet members.

They then reached a complete agreement on response measures and the implementation of the Anglo-French allied war plans. In addition, the issue of converting various industries to war industries to increase arms production was also discussed. As the issue of troop deployments had already been resolved at the previous decisive meeting, this decisive meeting only studied general military strategy issues. (Havas, 22nd)

Paris - Yesterday's Anglo-French Supreme Military Conference held in England focused on economic issues, not only concerning military industrial production but also involving other important issues such as guaranteeing exports and enabling the Allies to gain neutral markets. The Allies' economic goal is to support the normal production of export industries. The Allied blockade of the German coast aims to exclude Germany from major overseas markets. In this way, not only can Britain and France maintain their positions, but they can also seize German markets. (Associated Press, 23rd)
