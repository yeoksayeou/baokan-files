Editorial

### The Three Groups of Wars in the International Arena

Why did England and France go to war with Germany? All the theories promoted and the purposes revealed can be fully applied to the issue of Japan's invasion of China in 1931. The Soviet Union's actions against Finland are said to have been learned from Germany's actions against Czechoslovakia and Austria, which are essentially the same. In fact, what the Soviet Union has shown and accomplished in the past three days is a complete microcosm of Japan's actions in China over the past two and a half years. Looking at the outbreak of wars, there is not only the Sino-Japanese group, but also the Anglo-Franco-German group, and the Soviet-Finnish group. The stimulation of war is not only personally experienced by the people of the belligerent countries, but also gradually affects philosophers and merchants around the world who are more sensitive to feelings, neutral diplomats and politicians who are self-satisfied and irresponsible, and hawkers and peddlers in any remote village or street corner who do not ask about the height of the sky or the distance of the earth. The reaction to the war has ranged from sighs and regrets to worries, doubts, shock, and heartache. The seriousness of the world situation was already apparent in 1931, and it was not until recently that foolish and numb humans began to feel and understand it. Is the Soviet Union more cruel than Japan? Is Finland larger than China? It is simply that the world did not expect Germany after Japan, and the Soviet Union after Germany, so everyone feels that the disaster is increasing from small to large, from far to near, and that the misfortune will befall them. Furthermore, Japan's bombastic rhetoric and fierce momentum were curbed by China's resistance, and the countries that were lacking in China helped them. Although Germany has defeated Poland, England and France are sufficient to contain Germany. These two things show that aggression is hateful but not beyond hope. Now, Finland is no match for the Soviet Union. Not only will the success of aggression be seen in northern Europe, but also those who support Japan and Germany may not be limited to the spiritual aspect. Like the spread of epidemics and like the spread of flames, the groups furrow their brows at the future of the world.

In this situation, at this time, human beings urgently need to be of one mind and one heart, and to work together to change the direction of the dynamic, correct mistakes in time, and stop the evolution of evil. Otherwise, the warring countries will only continue to kill and destroy each other. The countries that have not yet fought will eventually fall into the whirlpool, participate in the killing and destruction, and thus suffer the killing and destruction. Even if there is a country that endures adversity and endures to the extreme, and treads on thin ice, and maintains neutrality to the end; its direct and indirect influence, the loss of markets, economic disorder, the stagnation of all industries, and the displacement of the four peoples, this is already unbearable. Moreover, given the current threats and lessons, it is also necessary to exhaust all its financial and economic strength to engage in strengthening national defense, expanding the navy, army, and air force, driving its entire people, applying military training, and imposing military organization. In short, even if it does not fight, it can only exhaust all its national strength to prepare for war without limitation. This is in general international terms. It should make the greatest efforts to deal with international phenomena, and neutral countries cannot stand aside. If it is said that war is inevitable, then it does not matter whether the war is right or wrong, whether the nature of the war is aggression or anti-aggression, whether anti-aggression can be abandoned, whether aggression also has room for forgiveness, whether the near and far causes of this war and the responsibility and its motives are the mistakes of history for hundreds of years, or the consequences of the Treaty of Versailles for the past twenty years, or a one-sided ambition, or an equal fire-fighting. In short, on any side, try to imagine the inevitable result of the war, and the inevitable phenomenon after the war, then the defeated is equal to destruction, at least so miserable that it cannot be described in words, and what is left for the winner? What is gained? Reason has right and wrong, and action has good and evil. The certain justice of this war will be upheld, and the violent brutality will be wiped out, which is deeply believed by civilized people with determination. Then why do warmongers not change their ways? If it is said that plundering resources, trampling on foreign races, attacking cities and seizing land, and fighting for hegemony are not aggression; if it is said that aggression has reason and necessity; if it is said that suppressing the strong and suppressing the weak is knowing oneself and knowing the enemy, and deceiving the weak and bullying the small is guaranteed to win a hundred battles; may I ask if justice is lost, mutual trust is not established, and after the war, the heroes will exhaust all their national strength again, and engage in an unlimited arms race again. Besides killing and destroying each other again, what can be done, what peace can there be? It is said that after the success of aggression, there are ways to deal with international affairs, which can be long-term and peaceful, but why not plan for it now? Therefore, no matter which side, letting the current phenomenon develop naturally will eventually lead to self-inflicted misfortune, and there is no way out.

If not letting it go, then what? I believe that civilized people should go to the difficulties together. Like the efforts of the Italian monarchs and ministers in late August, the repeated suggestions of the US president, and the appeals of the two kings of the Netherlands and Belgium, should not be sighed away because of the lack of achievements in the past, and there should be no further action. The Pope yesterday suggested to all belligerent countries to cease fire for six days before and after Christmas, so that these six days would be more meaningful and more valuable. All parties should gather the greatest strength to promote the overall resolution of the group of wars. If an overall solution is not obtained, any proactively warring party should be encouraged to take the lead in accepting reasonable settlement proposals!

(3) Finland agrees to cede the Rybachi Peninsula, the Sredny Peninsula (both on the Arctic coast), and several small islands on the Arctic coast to the Soviet Union, for a price of 30 million marks.

### Pope Proposes Christmas Truce of Six Days; Germany States Need for Concrete Guarantees;

 (Copenhagen) This newspaper's Berlin correspondent recently telegraphed that Pope Pius XII has proposed to all belligerent nations a six-day truce during Christmas, specifically from December 22nd to 27th. The German government agrees, but insists on seeking concrete guarantees, lest the enemy take advantage of the situation. They also stated that this proposal may cause technical difficulties. On the Western Front, German artillery has not been active except to respond to enemy fire. The key to the truce does not lie with Germany. Regarding naval warfare, a truce is difficult to monitor and therefore hard to implement. (Havas, 3rd)

Polish Ambassador to the UK Submits Note to UK Detailing German Atrocities;

US Government Considers Steps to Aid Finland; Moral Sanctions Against the Soviet Union; Urges Cooperation from Arms Manufacturers; Borah Proposes Finland Defer War Debt;

 (Washington) President Roosevelt has explicitly identified the Soviet Union as the aggressor and has adopted a sanctioning approach towards the Soviet Union. Although this runs contrary to the intentions of some members of Congress who are drafting neutrality legislation, it is supported by the majority of the American public. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov described President Roosevelt's call for Moscow not to bomb civilians as "aimless," which further angered the American people. Official sources state that the US embassy in Finland has formally reported the bombing of Finnish civilian centers and the tragic deaths of women and children. At one point, during a trans-Atlantic telephone call, the sound of exploding bombs could be heard. This morning, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull discussed US-Soviet relations and the overall issue of future steps the government could take in response to the situation for a considerable time. (Reuters, 2nd)

 (New York) President Roosevelt remained at the White House yesterday, foregoing his planned trip to Hyde Park and even missing the annual Army-Navy football game, which he greatly enjoys. The White House stated that President Roosevelt is intensely interested in the political developments and that he retains complete control over all major decisions, with Secretary of State Hull merely providing counsel. Although the US has abandoned plans to sever diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, it will make various attempts to aid Finland. Finland's debt payment to the US, due in mid-December, will be allowed to be deferred. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may loan money to Finland, and there is also consideration of providing Finland with arms. Therefore, the US does not intend to declare the Soviet-Finnish conflict subject to the Neutrality Act, as that would hinder the US from supplying arms to Finland. However, the government offers a different explanation for not invoking the Neutrality Act this time, stating that a state of war has not been officially declared between the Soviet Union and Finland, and thus the Neutrality Act does not apply. (Haitong, 3rd)

 (Washington) President Roosevelt today issued a formal statement, hoping that US manufacturers and exporters of aircraft and aircraft parts will remember the US government's policy of condemning the "wanton bombing" of civilians. However, the statement did not mention any specific country. When issuing the president's statement, President Roosevelt's Secretary, Early, stated that US manufacturers and exporters are already cooperating with the government policy outlined in the statement and he wished to draw public attention to this positive spirit. Official and diplomatic circles believe that President Roosevelt's statement is an important development in the formulation of US wartime policy and a step by the US government to strengthen its executive power, as the US government seeks greater authority to pursue its foreign policy, which is currently constrained by the Neutrality Act. (Reuters, 2nd)

 (Washington) President Roosevelt's Secretary, Early, stated today that President Roosevelt yesterday requested that the Soviet Union and Finland refrain from inhumane and barbaric acts of bombing civilians from the sky. He added that he now understands that the US government has received a telegram from the Soviet official news agency TASS, containing a public statement by Molotov dismissing President Roosevelt's call as "aimless" and stating that the Soviet Union has not and does not intend to bomb Finnish cities. He expressed confusion as to how this statement could be considered a response to President Roosevelt's telegram, asking those who question its aim to ask the dead and injured civilians or their families. (Reuters, 2nd)

 (Washington) According to government sources, the Soviet Purchasing Commission, currently in the US, will sign contracts to purchase aircraft and parts. Therefore, the US will immediately declare a "moral embargo," but responsible officials remain silent. Well-informed sources believe that the official silence is due to President Roosevelt's desire for the Soviet Union to understand that the "moral embargo" is not merely a diplomatic gesture. It is understood that government officials are discussing the possibility of a complete embargo against the Soviet Union and a severance of diplomatic relations. Well-informed sources believe that the US government's attitude will depend on the development of the Finnish war and that the US will do its utmost to enhance Finland's position morally. (Haitong, 3rd)

 (Los Angeles) Southern California aircraft manufacturers stated today that they will comply with President Roosevelt's recommendation and declare a "moral cancellation" of all orders from the Soviet Union for aircraft and materials. (Reuters, 2nd)

 (Washington) American isolationist leader Republican Senator Borah and independent Senator Norris yesterday suggested that Finland's war debt of $18,300,000 to the US should be deferred until the Soviet-Finnish dispute is resolved. However, this debt deferral must be approved by Congress before it can take effect. (United Press, 3rd)

Hoover Advocates Recall of Ambassador to the Soviet Union;

 (California) Former US President Hoover today advocated that the US recall its ambassador to the Soviet Union, stating that "we must treat the Soviet Union as we treat Germany." He added that after the US ambassador returns home, only a chargé d'affaires should be maintained in Moscow. (United Press, 3rd)

 (Moscow) Following the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, rumors spread that the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, had been recalled. Ambassador Steinhardt himself denied this rumor. (Havas, 2nd)

 (New York) The Hearst newspapers today published an editorial on the front page stating that the US should immediately withdraw its recognition of the Soviet Union and sever all relations. The Soviet Union's "barbaric attack" on Finland is a crime "beyond description." (Reuters, 2nd)

Finnish Foreign Minister Requests US Economic Aid;

 (Washington) Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner yesterday delivered a broadcast address to the United States, stating that Finland is limited by its budget and unable to adequately purchase anti-aircraft guns to strengthen its national defense. Upon hearing this, many members of the US Congress stated that the US should now allow the Finnish government to temporarily suspend payment of war debt principal and interest, or directly lend funds to Finland. Regarding the latter option, if President Roosevelt believes that a state of war does not exist between Finland and the Soviet Union, the US government can lend funds to Finland. Otherwise, it must act in accordance with the Neutrality Act and refuse to lend funds to any belligerent nation. Diplomatic circles here expressed their approval of this proposal by members of Congress, stating that since the American people sympathize with Finland, the US government may as well provide financial assistance.

American Prominent Reporter Comments on Far East Situation; Moscow Newspaper Publishes Article Refuting It, Claiming He is Sowing Discord between Soviet and Japanese Relations;

 (Moscow) American prominent reporter Lippmann recently published an article in the "New York Herald Tribune" discussing the Far East situation, stating that "Japan may now intend to conclude a treaty with the Soviet Union and see it as advantageous. Once the European war ends, the British fleet will be transferred to Singapore, and the US fleet may also sail there. This is what Japan should remember." The Communist Party organ "Pravda" recently denounced Lippmann as a "hyena full of ink" and a "militaristic speculator," and sarcastically added, "Lippmann is extremely afraid of a treaty being signed between Japan and the Soviet Union. Therefore, after this rumor emerged, he threatened with the intervention of the US Navy." Foreign observers here commented that this is the first time that the Soviet Communist Party organ has addressed the possibility of a treaty being signed between Japan and the Soviet Union, and its willingness to sign a treaty with Japan can be seen from this article.

Japanese Strongholds in Qiongzhou Island Waver; Puppet Mayor of Haikou Shot by Chinese Youth; Map of Japan, India, and Qiongzhou Colored the Same as Japan and Taiwan;

 A dispatch from Guangzhou Bay reports that in the past month, most of the Japanese strongholds in the interior of Qiongzhou Island have begun to waver. Japanese troops have voluntarily retreated from Ximei, Baoluo, Lingwu, and Longfa. Chinese troops have fiercely fought and recaptured Jiaji, Shiyan, and Hongsha near Lielou. It is reported that more than a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed in Jiaji, and several extremely heinous traitors of the puppet maintenance association were captured alive and executed by firing squad after being approved by a public assembly. On October 12th, at 3:00 AM, Chinese troops launched a surprise attack on Shiyan, killing over fifty Japanese soldiers. Near Lielou, twelve Japanese soldiers were killed. The above figures are based on reports from villagers. When the Japanese troops retreated from Longfa and other places, they destroyed fortifications and burned villages and saplings, as if they no longer had any intention of returning. There are still remnant Japanese military tunnels in Longfa, covered with wooden planks, extending about twenty miles and leading directly outside the town. According to news from Sanjiaoling (the intersection of roads leading to Ding'an, Jiaji, and Huiwen), the Japanese troops are forcing villagers to dig tunnels to prevent surprise attacks by Chinese troops. Their weak strength is evident. Since the middle of last month, Haikou's Japanese troops have twice prepared to depart for Guangzhou. According to eyewitnesses at the port, the two hundred or so Japanese troops are no longer seen in the former German consulate and Xinxing Street area. The troops stationed near the Japanese army headquarters in Deshengsha used to assemble and call roll every morning at 7:00 AM and afternoon at 8:00 PM, but recently, due to a sharp decrease in numbers, they have stopped doing so.

 The sharp reduction in the strength of the Japanese troops stationed in Qiongzhou has forced the Japanese to develop puppet troops with all their might. Some of the strongholds in the western region have been filled by puppet troops. Many of the idle members of the puppet Weixin Club have been dispatched to serve as puppet officials with puppet self-defense vehicles. This motley crew extorts money in various ways in the interior, or carries out looting under the guise of investigating smuggled goods. Their combat effectiveness is not worth a single blow from the Chinese army, and their atrocities of oppressing the local people can only encourage those with weak wills to embark on the resolute path of resisting Japan. In Haikou, on October 25th, a youth from Dan County assassinated the puppet mayor, Mao [illegible]. According to the youth's confession, he had never met Mao [illegible] before. Therefore, he broke into the city hall and opened fire on a puppet secretary. Unfortunately, a malfunction occurred in the gun's mechanism, and the shot missed, allowing the villains to escape with their lives. However, the motive of the martyr shows the innerland populace's burning hatred of traitors.

 Recently, a new map of East Asia has been discovered in Haikou. Hainan Island is colored deep red, the same as Taiwan and the Japanese mainland, distinct from other occupied areas. As a result, rumors that Japan intends to incorporate Hainan Island into its territory have once again spread like dust. The puppet Central Guidance Department, established for the purpose of intensifying political offensives, also proclaims the goal of "Japan-Qiongzhou Cooperation" instead of "Japan-China Cooperation." It has a "Guidance" department, admitting its ugly role as a street sweeper. According to the impressions of a member of a delegation sent from Qiongzhou to Japan for inspection, all twelve members of the delegation, all of whom were personnel of puppet organizations, did not understand Japanese at all. They were translated everywhere by the third son of Katsuwada, the chief of the Japanese naval special service in Hainan Island, as if they were representatives of a colony meeting with the suzerain state. In mid-October, the big and small traitors of the puppet provisional government gathered for a drink at the Qiongnan Restaurant in Haikou. Due to their lack of awareness, they angered the nearby Japanese troops and were severely beaten.

 The strict regulations on the control of import and export trade were once lifted at the end of October, replaced by the Yokohama Specie Bank in Haikou sending Zhou [illegible] to collect a 10% handling fee from each merchant before issuing import and export certificates. However, this good fortune was as fleeting as a ephemera. Mitsui Bussan implemented a "goods exchange method" similar to that of "Manchukuo." The commercial shipping of third countries suffered a fatal blow.

 Although British merchant ships are unprofitable, they are still willing to maintain the Hong Kong-Haikou route. However, they recently received a notice from the Japanese navy that from 9:00 AM on November 9th to 9:00 AM on November 11th, third-country ships were absolutely prohibited from passing through the Qiongzhou Strait. This, coupled with the Japanese navy's action of rushing to build thousands of rafts and transporting them to Weizhou Island half a month ago, indicates that the Japanese army's landing in Qinzhou Bay and invasion of Guangxi province was planned long ago.

War Report from Northern Jiangsu; Chinese Troops Once Broke into Baoying; Japanese Troops in Rugao Released Tear Gas;

 (Baoying) Baoying city originally had a garrison of three to four hundred Japanese soldiers. On the afternoon of the 23rd, over two hundred Japanese soldiers left Baoying through the north gate and attacked east to Baxianbu. They engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese troops at Laoheqiao, which lasted all night. On the morning of the 24th, a unit of Chinese troops advanced from the side of Liujiaqiao, encircling the Japanese troops from behind. The Chinese military authorities, realizing that the Japanese garrison in Baoying County was weak, extracted elite troops on the morning of the 24th to break in through the south gate and engage in street fighting with the Japanese troops in the city. The Chinese troops were exceptionally brave, advancing wave after wave. By the afternoon, they were still in a state of stalemate with the Japanese troops. The Chinese troops then dispatched another unit to continue reinforcing, completing the encirclement of Baoying and killing five to sixy Japanese soldiers. At the same time, a Japanese force that left Baoying through the north gate and harassed Laoheqiao via Baxianbu was also encircled and ambushed by Chinese troops. This force, being trapped on both sides and realizing that Baoying had been attacked by Chinese troops, concentrated intense artillery fire on the Chinese troop positions, breaking through the encirclement line and fleeing back to Baoying County in a chaotic manner on the evening of the 24th. Japanese troops from Gaoyou, seeing that Baoying was besieged, also dispatched reinforcements on the morning of the 25th, sailing to Baoying by warships and steamships, and coordinated with the Japanese troops in the city to launch a counterattack against the Chinese troops. To avoid heavy casualties, the Chinese troops safely withdrew on the morning of the 25th and remained on the original positions outside the city, waiting for an opportunity to attack again. In this battle, the Chinese troops killed over sixty Japanese soldiers in the city and dozens of Japanese soldiers at Laoheqiao and Liujiaqiao. The Chinese troops also suffered considerable losses.

 (Funing) On the Funing front, on the 23rd, Japanese troops sailed two steamships and towed two sailing boats from the estuary to Xiaolugang, and then turned to Xiaomiaokou, landing under the cover of machine guns and artillery. They were met with a counterattack by Chinese troops. The Japanese troops, unable to withstand the attack, hurriedly fled eastward on the original boats. In this battle, over ten Japanese and puppet troops were killed, and the Chinese troops suffered slight casualties. The next day, Japanese troops from Fucheng again drove four cars to Danjiagang to search and harass, and encountered a counterattack from Chinese troops. The Japanese troops did not dare to linger and immediately fled.

 (Pixian) More than a hundred Japanese soldiers from Guanhuzhen on the Xudong Longhai Railway in Pixian attacked Xunlou Zigou on the 20th, attempting to "mop up" Gangshang, where the Pixian government is located. Wang Huayun, the county magistrate, immediately led the county's regular troops to bravely attack the Japanese troops, followed by melee combat. The Japanese troops, unable to withstand the attack, retreated while fighting. The Chinese troops besieged and pursued them along the way for more than a dozen miles. In this battle, seven Japanese soldiers were killed, and dozens of puppet soldiers were killed or wounded. The Chinese troops also captured a large number of helmets, ammunition, biscuits, and canned goods.

 (Rugao) Over two hundred Japanese infantry and artillery troops, carrying two artillery pieces, advanced from Shili Temple toward the Chinese army's positions thirteen miles east and west, firing artillery shells and releasing many tear gas canisters. After the Chinese troops bravely counterattacked and sent a commando team to attack from the rear of the Japanese troops, the Japanese troops began to retreat. In this battle, over ten Chinese soldiers were poisoned and are being treated by military doctors.

 (Siyang) Previously, Japanese and puppet troops from Huaian, Siyang, Muxu, and Siyang counties joined forces to "mop up" the Shuqiang county government, resulting in fierce fighting. According to reliable reports from all sides, in the Sibei battle, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered a total of over a hundred casualties, mostly from Siyang city. Zhang Daguo, the captain of the Zhongxing puppet self-defense force, was also seriously injured. Over twenty corpses of Japanese soldiers from Huaiyin were burned in Zhongxing, and the stench reached far outside the garrison. Therefore, the Japanese and puppet troops deeply resented this invasion of Sibei, considering the heavy losses incurred.

 (Suining) Two hundred Japanese infantry soldiers, over twenty cavalry soldiers, and one hundred and twenty puppet soldiers, equipped with two mountain guns, mortars, flat-trajectory guns, eighteen light machine guns, and three heavy machine guns, sneaked through Weiji and entrenched themselves in Xuzhuang, attempting to "mop up" the guerrilla area in the northwest of the Chinese troops. Jin Xiushan, the captain of the sixth district self-defense brigade of the Chinese troops, led his troops to intercept them. County Magistrate Liu Tianzhan also dispatched a team to distribute troops on the north and south mountains of Mawei Mountain, Shuanggu Mound, and Liulou, as well as the mountainous area east and west of Huayan Bai Mountain, waiting for the Japanese and puppet troops to launch a surprise attack after they entered the area. As the Japanese and puppet troops approached, the two sides made contact at Mawei Mountain. County Magistrate Liu personally commanded the battle, launching a mobile war. The Chinese troops, stationed on the various mountain peaks, bravely intercepted the enemy, inflicting casualties on the Japanese and puppet troops. At the same time, a Japanese aircraft flew around the airspace above Yinggong Mountain for reconnaissance. Until 3:00 PM, the Japanese and puppet troops sneaked into the area south of Shixia Lin. As the Chinese troops had not had time to replenish their ammunition, they moved to the [illegible] area that night.

Situation in Kulangsu After the Consular Body Yields to the Japanese; The Municipal Council Claims a Satisfactory Resolution; Japanese Take the Opportunity to Send Detectives to Arrest Chinese on a Large Scale; Many Chinese Retreat from Gulangsu, a Very Desolate Scene;

 A dispatch from Fuzhou reports that after the Kulangsu Consular Body accepted Japanese demands, including the establishment of a Japanese deputy chief inspector and Taiwanese police officers in the Municipal Council, the suppression of anti-Japanese movements, and the reorganization of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Japanese withdrew their marines at the end of last month, lifted the blockade, and restored traffic between Kulangsu and the mainland. The Municipal Council also issued a notice stating that the Kulangsu issue has been satisfactorily resolved and that residents must not engage in any actions beyond the rules in Kulangsu. (1) All anti-Japanese publications, textbooks, slogans, etc., are prohibited from circulation and use. (2) No anti-Japanese gatherings, associations, or parades are allowed. (3) The display of the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag on Kulangsu is prohibited. (4) It is forbidden to carry firearms and explosives without permission. Those engaging in the above prohibited actions will be deported by the Municipal Council or handed over to the Japanese authorities for punishment. After the issuance of this notice, the Japanese sent consulate police, special agency agents, and Taiwanese police officers from the Municipal Council under the pretext of suppressing anti-Japanese elements to search for and arrest anti-Japanese elements, handing them over to the Municipal Council or sending them to the Japanese Naval Headquarters in Xiamen for trial. The puppet government of Xiamen also sent Wu Ruikun, Zhou Wenchao, Chen Tianshui, Pan Zhitang, Chen Guoquan, Ke Bingfu, Ke Guanghan, and others to participate in the organization of the Kulangsu District Chamber of Commerce, extending their influence in the Kulangsu business community, monopolizing the market, promoting Japanese goods, purchasing Chinese products, and preparing for the reorganization of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the election of the Municipal Council Board of Directors. However, the Chinese people residing in Kulangsu have completely lost their freedom of speech and action and are at risk of disappearing or losing their lives at any time. They have petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest to the British, French, and American ambassadors to China and requested the restoration of the original state and the cessation of illegally depriving Chinese of their rights. A satisfactory response has not yet been received. It is found that many of the residents of Kulangsu were previously wealthy returned overseas Chinese or their families. As a result, the garden villas on the island are numerous. When Xiamen fell last May, most of the overseas Chinese took their families to Hong Kong or abroad, and more than half of the famous gardens and mansions were closed. With this compromise between the Consular Body and the Japanese, those who are capable have moved to the interior to seek other ways out. Those who remain stranded on the island are only small merchants and the poor. The prosperous scene is vastly different from what it was before. The Japanese have also ordered Chinese and foreign stores to register all their inventory with the Municipal Council, which will tax them at a price (a total of more than 100,000 yuan) to pay for the salaries of the Municipal Council's newly hired Japanese staff. The free entry and exit of Japanese and Taiwanese people in the stores greatly affects business. Chinese and foreign merchants are now planning to deal with this.

 The rice, firewood, meat, and vegetables needed by Kulangsu were originally supplied by Zhangzhou. When the Japanese blockaded the area, transportation was cut off and prices soared several times. Now that traffic has been opened, various local products from Zhangzhou are transported to Kulangsu as usual, and daily necessities are also transported from Kulangsu to Zhangzhou. Prices in both Zhangzhou and Kulangsu are gradually falling. Statistics show that from mid-September to mid-November, the value of goods transported from Zhangzhou to Kulangsu was only over 100,000 yuan, all of which were local products and raw materials. The value of goods transported from Kulangsu to Zhangzhou reached over 1.1 million yuan, mostly luxury goods and consumables. The trade deficit amounted to more than 900,000 yuan, of which Japanese goods accounted for a significant portion. In recent months, foreign ships from Hong Kong and Shanghai have been passing through Fujian Province as usual. The entry and exit points are Hanjiang, Quanzhou, and Sandu. It is reported that these foreign ships must pay fees to the Japanese navy and obtain certificates before they can avoid being obstructed along the way. (November 22nd)

Investigation of the Tung Oil Industry in Zhejiang; Perfect Organization for Transportation and Sales; Uniform Price Per Dan; Increases Economic Strength During Wartime;

 (Jinhua Correspondence) Tung oil is one of the raw materials necessary for modern military industry. Today, without the invention or discovery of other substitutes, its importance is no less than that of cotton and steel, because it has special properties of moisture and rust prevention. Military equipment such as airplanes, artillery, tanks, submarines, and various ships cannot last if they do not have Tung oil as an outer coating, and may even lose their effectiveness. As international tensions rise, the need for Tung oil has increased dramatically as countries seek to expand their military capabilities. Although countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union have transplanted Chinese Tung seeds to their countries, the quality of their products is far inferior to that of China due to climate and soil conditions. Tung trees are subtropical and temperate plants. China is located in the temperate zone, and the area suitable for planting Tung trees can be said to cover the whole country. Provinces such as Guangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian are close to the tropics and have abundant rainfall, so they are suitable for planting Tung trees. Provinces such as Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei have temperate climates and are also suitable for planting Tung trees. Provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi all have land and climate that are suitable for planting Tung trees, so Tung oil has become a special product of China. According to national statistics, the annual output is more than 2,000,000 dan, ranking first among China's exports.

 Zhejiang has only been producing Tung oil for more than a decade. The annual output is more than 200,000 dan, accounting for one-tenth of the total national output, which is not a small amount. In recent years, various counties have worked hard to promote it, and there is a growing trend. It has unlimited hope for international trade and the future of rural economy. Especially during this time of resistance, it is more important to increase the production of Tung oil in order to earn foreign exchange to enhance the economic strength of the war of resistance, to seek the prosperity of the rural economy, and to lay the foundation for the construction of the country during the war of resistance. The number of Tung oil producing counties in Zhejiang, the transportation and sales organizations, and the recent price situation are described in the following paragraphs for the reference of those who are concerned about the Tung oil business.

 Number of Producing Counties; Zhejiang Province's Tung oil producing areas account for 60% of the province, or more than 40 counties. Those in the Qiantang River Basin include Chun'an, Yuqian, Lanxi, Jinhua, Fenshui, Changhua, Tonglu, Jiande, Zhuji, Pujiang, Qu County, Jiangshan, Shouchang, Suian, Changshan, Kaihua, Dongyang, Tangxi, Longyou, Yiwu, Wuyi, Yongkang, Xindeng, Xiaofeng, Lin'an, Sheng County, etc., 26 counties in total. Those in the Ou River Basin include Lishui, Longquan, Yongjia, Pingyang, Jinyun, Songyang, Suichang, Xuanping, Yunhe, Ruian, Qingyuan, Jingning, Taishun, Qingtian, etc., 14 counties in total. Counties such as Xianju, Linhai, Huangyan, Tiantai, Wenling, and Nantian in the Taizhou region, and Xinchang in the Ningbo region also have considerable output. However, the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area has always had little Tung production, and although it is a guerrilla area, it has no impact on the amount of oil produced. According to the output of the above counties, Chun'an has the highest output, with an annual output of 18,000 dan, and Qingtian has the lowest output, with an annual output of 1,000 dan. According to the survey conducted by the China Vegetable Oil Factory in the 21st year of the Republic, there were a total of 32 counties, totaling 194,600 dan. The special product survey conducted by the Construction Department in the 23rd year of the Republic counted 33 counties, totaling 150,000 dan. The survey conducted by the cooperative instructors in various counties in the 25th year of the Republic also counted 32 counties, totaling 147,000 dan. The Tung oil Office statistics in the 27th year of the Republic were 32 counties, totaling 180,000 dan. In the same year, the Tung cake survey of organic fertilizer production and sales by the Adjustment Office counted 33 counties. Converted from the 170,000 dan of Tung cake in Jiande County alone, the total amount almost reached 300,000 dan. The survey conducted by the Oil Tea Cotton Silk Management Office in the 28th year of the Republic only counted 27 counties, totaling 113,500 dan. There is a large difference between the six surveys, and it is difficult to know exactly how much. However, these surveys may not reflect the actual situation and are difficult to use as a standard. However, according to the statistics of the actual sales volume by the Transportation and Sales Office recently, the oil production in Zhejiang Province is indeed more than 200,000 dan per year.

 Transportation and Sales Organizations; In the past, there was little organization for Tung oil transportation and sales. Oil firms were allowed to sell freely according to local conditions. The situation can be divided into the Jinquyan and Wenchuzhou transportation and sales areas. The oil from the counties in the Jinquyan area is first concentrated in Lanxi and transported to Hangzhou for sale in Shanghai. The oil from the Wenchuzhou area is first concentrated in Lishui and transported to Yongjia for sale in Shanghai. This natural trend has lasted for many years. Since the start of the "July 7th" war of resistance, the Zhejiang Provincial Standing Committee has established the Jinquyan and Wenchuzhou Tung oil Transportation and Sales Offices in the winter of the 26th year of the Republic, as official-commercial joint organizations, in order to find ways to export the original Tung oil, maintain the rural economy, and promote foreign trade. Transportation and Sales Offices were established in Yongkang and Wenzhou, and offices were established in Lanxi and Ningbo. At the same time, for the convenience of management, the Tung oil Transportation and Sales Headquarters was established in Lishui. In February of this year, in order to further manage special products and control foreign sales, the Zhejiang Provincial Oil Tea Cotton Silk Management Office was established, which was responsible for the management and foreign sales of special products. The original Tung oil Transportation and Sales Headquarters was announced to be closed. In October, the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Central Government re-signed an agreement to cancel the Jinquyan and Wenchuzhou Transportation and Sales Offices, and the Management Office directly received the goods. The organizational structure has become more perfect. According to the past situation and the current situation, its organization and payment system have been expanded. Three oil collection offices have been established in the Jinquyan area, the Wenchuzhou area, and the Ningshao area. Under the offices, there are nine oil collection stations in Yongkang, Lanxi, Chun'an, Qu County (belonging to the Jinquyan area), Lishui, Yunhe, Yongjia (belonging to the Wenchuzhou area), Linhai, and Ningbo (belonging to the Ningshao Tai area). The oil-producing counties affiliated to each station entrust the local bank, cooperative credit union, trading public store, or oil firm or cooperative in the county to establish a special agency to set up an oil collection agency. This organization is an organization that implements the principle of universal oil collection, and can also be said to be an organization of oil collection networks.

 Recent Prices; In the past, when there were Transportation and Sales Offices, the oil prices in various places were different in order to concentrate oil collection, so that oil farmers could transport and sell freely. The reorganization of the Transportation and Sales Organization this time The provincial government has stipulated a uniform price for the purpose of implementing the principle of universal oil collection, which is 50 yuan per market dan, plus a subsidy of one yuan for containers. At the current foreign sales price in Hong Kong dollars, each dan can get 135 yuan, which is equivalent to 405 yuan in national currency (at 3 yuan). The distribution of the price of each dan of oil by the Central Government for the exchange of foreign exchange and the handling fees for purchasing, and the management and improvement costs of the provincial government are as follows:

 Explanation: (1) The price of oil in Hong Kong fluctuates from time to time. The prices listed in this table are the most recent market prices. (2) The price of oil agreed by the provincial government and the China Trust Bureau is 76 yuan in national currency. In addition to the 50 yuan given to the oil farmers, the other 26 yuan are used for management, improvement, anti-smuggling, parity and other expenses. However, the operating expenses are actually paid. (3) The rise and fall of oil prices are restricted by the agreement, and any market price, its income belongs to the China Trust Bureau of the Trade Association, and the provincial government and oil farmers have no relationship.

 Because the need for Tung oil in the military is more important than anything else, the foreign sales price is so high. According to the national output of 2,000,000 dan, calculated according to the current Hong Kong dollar, the total value in national currency can be 810,000,000 yuan. Calculated according to the 200,000 dan in Zhejiang, it can get 81,000,000 yuan in national currency. Therefore, Tung oil is the largest source of income for the wartime economy. If further efforts are made to improve production, manufacturing, transportation and sales as much as possible, it will not only dominate the international market.

Regular Troops of Tongshan County Launch Night Attack on Xuzhou; Two Japanese Soldiers Stabbed to Death in the Residence of a Japanese Officer; Fierce Fighting Occurs Near Liuxinji;

 Dispatch from Xuzhou: Zhang Ziqu, commander of the 7xth company of the xth battalion of the regular troops of Tongshan County, recently led his troops to attack Xuzhou Station. At night, he sent six detectives to scout out the situation of the Japanese troops. They discovered the residence of a Japanese officer on Liangshi East Street. The detectives risked entering the room and stabbed one person in the lower abdomen with a knife, killing him instantly. Another Japanese person, seeing this, was shocked and shouted for help, trying to escape through the window, but was shot by the detectives with a pistol and also died. At that time, nearby Japanese troops gathered upon hearing the gunfire and surrounded the detectives. Seeing the dangerous situation, the detectives deemed it unwise to resist and broke through the encirclement to the east, returning to their defense safely that night. After this attack, the station was heavily guarded, and the inspection of pedestrians was more rigorous than before. However, the Chinese regular troops are still looking for opportunities to attack again.

 Also, it is reported that over a hundred Japanese soldiers in more than ten trucks returned to Xuzhou from the southeast a few days ago. The troops of Meng Guangyuan, the commander of the third company of the xth battalion of the regular troops of Tongshan County, and the troops of Wang Bingyue of the xth battalion ambushed west of Pantang on the Zheng-Hai Highway, preparing to intercept them. They made contact with the Japanese troops near Liuxinji and engaged in fierce fighting for five hours. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and sent reinforcements from Xuzhou and west of Pantang, encircling Meng and Wang's troops. A melee then broke out, which was not lifted until dusk. In this battle, a total of eleven Japanese soldiers were killed and six wounded. Meng, the captain of the Chinese side, also bravely died. A squad leader was injured, and fifteen soldiers were killed. After suffering this heavy blow, the Japanese troops mobilized a large number of troops to search the villages within twenty miles of the incident

There is No Rice Shipment between China and US
Source of Japanese Rice Imports By: Bao Leti

The most powerful excuse used by unscrupulous merchants to manipulate rice prices is that Japan is scouring for rice to bring back to their country. This is a deceptive claim, and this publication has repeatedly exposed its falsehood, citing Japanese customs records as evidence. However, some people doubt my claims, so I present the following figures: (Unit: 1 Koku)

Year 1936 1927 1928 5-Year Average
China 2 1 0 0.6
India 57 49 155 7.312
Annam 0 0 10,039 10,655
Thailand 398,196 286,091 325,354 236,410
Dutch East Indies — 8 — 5
Other 6 1,349 23 282
Total 298,261 287,498 345,541 254,666

Those who intend to disrupt the rice market say, "Last year there was none, but this year there is a lot." However, for the first nine months of this year, Japan's rice trade was in surplus, not deficit. This rumor is also poorly fabricated. (Unit: 1,000 Yen)

Those who deliberately intend to disrupt the rice market will never be short of excuses. Thus, they say, "Chinese rice exports to Japan are not included in customs records;" they say, "In the future, there may soon be Chinese rice exports to Japan;" or they say, "The rice that Japan is scouring for is all transshipped to Tianjin;" or they say, "It is supplied to the Japanese army stationed in China;" or they say, "The Japanese and their puppets monopolize the source and extort at will." There is no reasoning with effective propaganda, but it doesn't hurt to try!

The first claim is purely sophistry. Regardless of ancient or modern times, in China or abroad, only military supplies and smuggled goods are not included in customs records. Rice is not military supplies, and there is no need to smuggle it. Therefore, it is not worth refuting.

The second claim can be disproved by comparing rice prices in Tokyo, Japan today with those in Shanghai. It will become clear that it is definitely impossible for Chinese rice to be exported to Japan, because rice prices in Tokyo are actually cheaper than in Shanghai (the following table converts each Shanghai Shi Stone to 0.0554 Japanese Koku; 1 Japanese Yen is legally converted to 1.3 Chinese Yuan; Unit: Chinese Yuan per Shi Stone. Tokyo prices are based on the Asahi Shimbun from the 20th of last month, Shanghai prices are based on the machine-milled rice prices from yesterday)

Highest Price Lowest Price
Tokyo 31.85 28.97
Shanghai 41.00 34.00

The third claim makes it impossible to verify, so that people can be deceived. Because Japanese people ship goods for export, most of them do not declare them at customs. Thus, they can make wild claims. However, anyone with a little common sense can also see through its falsehood. Firstly, the Yangtze River area is originally the main rice-producing area of the country, and it is usually responsible for supplying food to all parts of the country. Now, due to difficulties in freight transport, Chinese merchants cannot transship it, and only Shanghai is the distribution center and the only outlet for the surplus rice production. Therefore, even if it is transshipped by the Japanese, the amount will definitely not exceed the usual transshipment volume. Therefore, Shanghai, as a distribution center, at least does not have a rice shortage. Secondly, after reviewing various newspapers in Tianjin, there is no Changshu rice on the market. This is proof that there is no northward transportation of Changshu rice. Not only that, in October, when rice prices in Shanghai rose to 41 yuan, the highest price in the Tianjin rice market was only 18.9 yuan, which further proves that it is impossible for Shanghai rice to be transported north. Could it be that the Japanese or unscrupulous merchants are willing to scour for expensive rice, plus all the freight and other expenses, and transport it to Tianjin for cheap sale to relieve the Chinese people in Tianjin? Isn't that seeing ghosts in broad daylight? (Tianjin prices are based on the Japanese "Research of Chinese Economy Bi-Weekly" Nos. 79 and 80, including 10 types of rice; Shanghai prices are based on "China and Foreign Economic Digest Monthly" Vol. 3, Issue 10 and this newspaper, including 14 types of rice) (Unit: Yuan per Stone)

October Highest Price October Lowest Price
Tianjin 18.9 13.0
Shanghai 41.0 27.0

Neither location is a rice-producing area; Tianjin is even further away from the producing area. However, Tianjin is cheap and Shanghai is expensive, there is a world of difference. The claim that Shanghai rice is transported north is obviously a fabrication. Or is it that unscrupulous merchants hope so, to vent their long-standing resentment for their repeated failures to request the restoration of national rice transshipment last year? From this, we can see that unscrupulous merchants' attempt to manipulate the rice market has been planned for more than a day; they had already made up their minds when they requested transshipment last year!

The purpose of the fourth claim is also to make it impossible to verify, so that people can be deceived, in order to achieve their conspiracy to manipulate rice prices. However, according to what we know, the main food for the Japanese army in China is wheat flour products, not rice, because it is convenient for marching and combat. Therefore, in recent years, a large amount of Japanese flour has been imported to China. On the one hand, it is indeed dumping, and on the other hand, it is not without supplying military use. The following is a statistic of Japanese flour imports to China in recent years. (Unit: 1,000 Yen, according to Japanese Customs Records)

Republic of China Northeast (Kwantung Four Provinces China Provinces East Asia)
Year 24 16,314 14,450 313
Year 25 8,832 6,013 620
Year 26 2,669 2,560 15,249
Year 27 3,901 15,748 23,063

Of course, there is the fact that the Japanese are scouring for rice in the occupied areas; but it is conceivable that most of it is resold to Chinese merchants, in order to profit from it. The Japanese army in China definitely consumes rice; however, the amount is definitely not as large as the general public imagines. However, if they don't exaggerate it, they can't achieve their purpose of manipulating rice prices, so they have to exaggerate it!

The fifth claim: Because harming people's food is originally a consistent policy of the Japanese and their puppets, they will naturally be happy to do it. Therefore, this claim is relatively reliable. But the export of surplus rice production in the rice-producing areas is related to us? Not only is it related to the livelihood of local farmers and the "order" of the local society, but it is also related to the income and safety of the Japanese and their puppets. Where does the large amount of Chinese Yuan that the Japanese use to buy foreign exchange come from? Rice is one source! Where does the money come from to maintain the puppet organizations and to bribe thugs? Rice is one source. Why are puppets puppets? Because of the Chinese Yuan; where does the Chinese Yuan come from? Rice is one source. If the surplus rice production in the rice-producing areas is not exported, the farmers will die of starvation, and the Japanese and their puppets will also suffocate, and the local "order" will definitely become more chaotic. However, the reason why they are arbitrarily intercepting it now is the same as the purpose of the unscrupulous merchants fabricating rumors and creating troubles. If this is the case, they can greatly exploit the food supply of 5 million citizens in this city, and each take a share of the spoils. However, in reality, the Japanese and their puppets are the ones who gain the most, and unscrupulous merchants only get the leftovers. Because the Japanese and their puppets know that the rice for the 5 million citizens of Shanghai is entirely in the hands of unscrupulous merchants, and the unscrupulous merchants are in the hands of the Japanese and their puppets; they can freely extort and take whatever they want. Since unscrupulous merchants are exploited, they sell it at double the price. If they get their wish, they will indeed have huge profits. But if they want to sell it off, they still have to consider the market price! If the profits are not high after calculating at the market price, those with capital will hoard it and drastically raise the price. Thus, fabricating rumors and creating troubles becomes a necessary plan for manipulation. When necessary, they may even instigate certain local puppet organizations to intensify the obstruction of rice exports, which is also something the Japanese and their puppets would be happy to do! However, in fact, the more they hoard, the more they lose money, the less hope they have of making money, and the less popular old rice becomes. Thus, the rice market in Shanghai has created today's stalemate; and these unscrupulous merchants are also in a difficult position. Therefore, if we can inspect warehouses carefully, force sales, actively rectify the rice market, and severely punish unscrupulous merchants (including rice industry scum who speculate directly and financial industry scum who speculate indirectly), the rice market will collapse in an instant. This is not necessarily a way to break the stalemate for unscrupulous merchants, it is not impossible; what is difficult is that if the concession authorities do not take action, no one can do it? In that case, the only feasible way is for major manufacturers, schools, institutions, organizations, etc. to form food consumption cooperatives!

The Current Crisis in Japan's Foreign Trade
Original Author: John Ahlers
From Millard's Review

Japan's foreign trade is heading straight for a crisis, and this crisis is bound to have repercussions on Japan's entire economy and finance. The scope of the crisis and the success or failure of the Tokyo government's struggle with this crisis will largely determine the future combat effectiveness and general combat potential of the Japanese army and navy in China.

Even in peacetime, when Japan's economic institutions are operating smoothly, it relies on foreign trade more than most other countries or major powers. In wartime, this dependence will definitely increase. In the current Sino-Japanese War, Japan is gradually showing its dependence on foreign trade more than in any previous war. Today, Japan's continued war adventure in China largely depends on the maintenance of its foreign trade. If Japan is unable to import as much military supplies and raw materials as it currently does, or is unable to export enough goods and gold; and obtain enough foreign exchange to pay for these exports, then its entire war economy, national budget, currency, and even its political institutions, are in danger of being overthrown.

About four months ago, when Washington abolished the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, Japan was suddenly hit and painstakingly adjusted its foreign trade to adapt to the situation created by the Chinese war, and made great sacrifices in its peacetime industries, civilian consumption, and financial preparations in order to keep things going. All treaties between Japan and other countries, the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty being the most important, accounted for no less than 44.23% of Japan's imports and 30% of exports (calculated from January to August 1939), excluding trade within the Japanese Yen bloc. The abolition of this treaty has caused the entire structure of Japan's foreign trade to tend towards chaos, but the Tokyo military did not feel very uncomfortable about this matter, but initially decided to let it expire on January 26, 1940, without ending its discriminatory policies against Western economic and financial interests in China. Four months ago, the Tokyo military hoped to induce Washington to conclude another commercial treaty, or to formulate appropriate measures to readjust Japan's war economy to adapt to the new situation.

But at that time, Tokyo held the illusion that Germany and Italy would be able to economically assist Japan. The Japanese military was completely unaware of the close relationship between Berlin and Moscow, and never suspected that the European war would break out in the fall. Economically speaking, the European war was another matter that frustrated and shocked the Japanese military, because it immediately presented Japan with many new difficulties in trade prices and currency. The Japanese military spent three months temporarily dealing with this new situation, without solving any of its problems. The U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty will expire in less than two months from now, and Tokyo has a short time to consider its trade situation with the United States. It appears that the treaty will not be extended, and a new treaty will not be concluded immediately before or after January 26, 1940.

The current U.S.-Japan commercial relationship is already showing a rapid trend towards a state of no treaty. U.S. banks no longer unconditionally pay cash for letters of credit issued by even first-class Japanese banks, and require very difficult-to-obtain formal guarantees from U.S. banks. Japanese purchase contracts accepted in the United States, but delivered after January 26, 1940, generally add a clause stipulating that any additional costs resulting from the abolition of the treaty shall be borne by the Japanese buyer. Americans who purchase Japanese goods also stipulate in the contract that these additional costs should be borne by the Japanese seller. Japanese forward transactions for U.S. goods and Japanese silk forward trade with the United States are also adversely affected due to the expiration date of January 26 next year.

The Japanese military is now eager to obtain any supplies it can from the United States. In recent weeks, they have not only added a large number of orders for weapons and other supplies that they are accustomed to obtaining from the United States, such as mineral oil products, but have also added huge amounts of machinery, steel, etc. These goods were originally ordered from Germany, Italy and other European countries. The total amount of U.S. goods ordered by the Japanese in the past six weeks has increased by 33%, because these orders require a large amount of down payment in cash and a supply of short-term foreign exchange to pay for the remaining price of the goods. Therefore, the remaining foreign exchange circulation funds and other foreign exchange reserves of the Bank of Japan are almost entirely used to finance these transactions.

After January 26, 1940, the state of no treaty between Tokyo and Washington will automatically produce various penalties, which will hit U.S. goods and ships. These penalties include (1) a 10% ad valorem tax on all Japanese goods and various goods carried by Japanese ships to the United States, (2) a tenfold increase in the tonnage tax on Japanese ships berthed in U.S. ports, and other methods that are generally extremely detrimental to Japan's trade and navigation with the United States. Of the foreign exchange that Japan obtains from export trade, that obtained from trade with the United States accounts for almost one-third, and Japan's shipping to the United States accounts for slightly less than half of the total foreign exchange revenue of Japan's commercial shipping.

Once the commercial treaty expires, Japan will face even greater dangers, because the U.S. government can prohibit the export of some or all goods to Japan at any time. U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman has drafted a resolution authorizing the President to prevent the shipment of U.S. armaments, military supplies, steel, scrap iron, and mineral oil products to Japan. In the past two and a half years, Japan has purchased all foreign war materials, of which two-thirds were imported from the United States. Now that the European war has broken out, Japan can no longer import many kinds of war materials from any other country. (To be continued)

"General Theory of Trust" by Zhu Si-huang of Chunqiu Book and Newspaper
Written by Professor Zhu Si-huang, newly published by Zhonghua Book Company
By Zhang Yifan

The trust industry is a new industry, originally an auxiliary to finance; it originated in the so-called Use of the thirteenth century and developed in Britain. It is now an independent department in the financial industry. It was introduced to our country after the European War. It was then frustrated by the so-called "trust and trading craze" due to fierce speculation at the time; since then, it has been in a slump. It was not until after the January 28 Shanghai War that it regained its vitality: not only have all banks added trust departments, but there are also no less than a dozen specialized trust companies in this city. Judging from its development, it is obviously far inferior to other financial industries. This is naturally constrained by the fact that our country's social economy is not yet fully modernized, but the lack of knowledge of the industry by the people of the country is also one of the main reasons.

My friend Professor Zhu Si-huang is an authority on this subject; he is knowledgeable and experienced, and is one of the most active promoters of the trust industry. Not only did he publish the Trust Quarterly early on, but he also lectured tirelessly to promote this subject. Now he has settled down and written a comprehensive treatise on trust law of hundreds of thousands of words, which has just been published by Zhonghua Book Company. I was honored to receive a copy and read it first; I was asked to review it, how dare I? I will just give a brief introduction.

Regarding the basic knowledge of trust law, there are no specialized works in the country; there is only one Japanese translation and two popular books; it is obvious that they are not sufficient as educational tools for university students to study this subject; now Zhu's book has filled this gap. The entire book is divided into five parts. The first part clarifies various concepts related to trust, and uses a brief history of the development of this industry in China and abroad to verify it. The resolution discusses the norms and methods of various businesses in great detail. It also discusses the function of trust companies in the social economy and their organization and activities. The last two parts: lay the legal basis for the trust industry, which will definitely make a great contribution to the drafting of trust laws in the future. It also points out the reasons why the trust industry in our country has failed to develop, and points out the policies that should be adopted when operating this industry in the future; it is even more insightful and profound, with many brilliant insights; I am afraid that it would be difficult to obtain such a refined work without Zhu Jun; I am even more happy to introduce it.

Commercial News Finance
Cash Trend Slightly Weak

The cash transaction in the black market showed a slight decline due to the weekly holiday. It was reported that the situation outside the market had slightly weakened. A small number of 4,160 yuan lots were once released, but the buying interest was sluggish. There were sellers at the above price, but no buyers. The closing price at noon yesterday fell by several yuan.

The selling price of gold bars and jewelry per tael remained at 420 yuan at Datong Bank. The new banks had the same price, and the purchasing price decreased by 15 to 20 yuan.

London, 2nd Telegram: British pure gold per ounce is still set at £8 8s

Food
Hoarding Households Cause Trouble
Initial Increase of 3 Yuan
Afternoon Take-Profit Selling

The rice market has risen by a huge 5 to 6 yuan in seven weeks. Yesterday, it was even more so because banks and godowns were closed on Sundays, and samples of godown goods were not released. In addition, only more than 20 trucks arrived from various sources. Generally, customers were tired from yesterday's decline and were hoping for better prices. In the morning, sales were already strong, and hoarding households and speculators once again stirred up trouble, with the prices of all kinds of japonica rice rising by as much as 3 yuan. The price of Changkun japonica rice even reached 43 to 44 yuan. This kind of chaotic market situation is getting worse and worse, and it is truly not a blessing for the people's food.

It is difficult to predict the material market. After all goods have been rising all the way, people generally feel that the momentum is too fast and feel weak. Many people are taking the opportunity to sell at high prices. In addition, because the foreign exchange market was closed on Sundays and the situation was unclear, everyone was afraid to buy again, which suddenly killed the rising trend and turned to slackness. Therefore, the result was that the price of japonica rice actually rose by more than 1 yuan. Chang粳粳 was 42 yuan, and Kunshan japonica rice was 41 to 40 yuan. The total number of transactions in the unified market was more than 8,000 bags.

Sugar Market
Hong Kong Merchants Distribute Coarse White Sugar

Because the foreign exchange rate has been tight for several days, the combined price of foreign sugar has increased frequently. Therefore, Hong Kong merchants have been purchasing coarse white sugar in Shanghai. As a result, the rising trend has become even stronger. The Association divided the spot market into 24 coarse white sugar, and the current godown price rose from 54 yuan to 56 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan. The initial price of foreign godowns was 54 yuan to 4.5 yuan, and then rose to 55 yuan to 57 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan in total. The price of re-exported goods was 44 yuan and 20 cents to 40 cents, and 45 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan. The price of Taikoo White Sugar also rose by 2.7 yuan. The initial price of B Mark was 55 yuan to 55.5 yuan, and then rose from 56.7 yuan to 57.5 yuan. CW Mark was 57 yuan, CX Mark was 56 yuan, DY Mark was 55.5 yuan, HHX Mark was 55 yuan, and H Mark Car Red Sugar rose by 1 yuan to 39 yuan to 39.5 yuan. Dutch Red Sugar was 41 yuan to 41.5 yuan. Domestic Refined White Sugar rose by 2 yuan. Zhenji No. 1 was 56 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, and 4 were returned at the original price. Domestic Rock Sugar rose by the same amount. No. 1 was 66.5 yuan, and Jingming Rock Sugar was 68 yuan. Domestic sugar had Jian Gang opening 410 bags of rough green sugar, 36.2 yuan.

Coal
White Coal Rises by 4 Yuan

Since the white coal market has been selling well for several days, due to the recent disputes between the Soviets and Finns, foreign merchant ships have raised freight rates, and cargo owners have taken the opportunity to raise prices. The prices of white coal such as Hongji Haifeng were all raised by 4 yuan by the same industry yesterday. The market price for customers was 120 yuan per ton for Hongji white coal, 118 yuan for Haifeng white coal, 118 yuan for No. 1 Small Coal, and 68 yuan for Hongji Chips, delivered to customers' homes, including transportation costs.

Seafood
End Near for Sales

Since new products of Annam Tail Shrimp have entered the market, the production price has been frequently reported to be rising. For example, the price of Taenhsia shrimp in Hong Kong has risen by 10 yuan, which is difficult to divide with the Shanghai price, resulting in a lack of buyers. Recently, only four boxes of Shatien Tail Shrimp have arrived, and the sales price is 205 yuan. There is no shortage of domestic products. The current market price for Jiangbei Honggang Tail Shrimp at Gaozhuang is 155 yuan, and small ones are 135 yuan. The trend is strong.

An Analysis of the Composition of Semen

Semen is the source of life, stored in the testicles. It is a viscous fluid, yellowish-white in color, with a peculiar odor, which mixes in halfway when the semen is ejaculated. Dissecting the testicles and extracting the semen from the testicles has little or no odor. This fluid is sticky and salty when fresh. After research, it is known to contain two substances with different effects, one being fluid and the other being semi-solid, forming small spheres. The two combine into one, and after contact with air, the small spheres can dissolve naturally. From a chemical point of view, semen is largely the same as the substances in the body, but with slight differences. Calculated in thousands, water accounts for 900 parts, colloid for 60 parts, sodium nutrients for 10 parts, and calcium and phosphorus nutrients for 30 parts. Semen that has left the body is a mixture of secretions from the testicles to the external urethral orifice. The main components, in addition to sperm, also contain testicular fluid, epididymal fluid, seminal vesicle fluid, prostate fluid; and Cowper's gland secretions, which are opaque. The amount of semen ejaculated each time: from 2 cc to 15 cc, so it is uncertain. The specific gravity varies depending on the amount of sperm it contains, but it averages between 1.02 and 1.04. If ejaculation occurs continuously, the amount gradually decreases until the semen is completely lacking.

Why does semen become deficient? In addition to the gradual decrease in semen produced due to old age, another reason is the waste of semen, which damages the reproductive function. Excessive masturbation and indulgence in lust not only waste semen, but also make the metabolic function sluggish. Over time, one often feels insufficient energy, cannot reproduce, suffers from nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation, and the erectile power of the sexual organs is also weak and incompetent, even damaging the brain, causing forgetfulness and insomnia. All these symptoms are caused by the exhaustion of semen. Therefore, to treat this kind of disease, one must increase semen and replenish blood, and at the same time quit masturbation and be careful in sexual matters in order to achieve the effect of treatment.

Based on my past experience in treating this type of disease, patients can only achieve the effects of nourishing semen, replenishing blood, nourishing the brain, and nourishing the kidneys by actively taking the German testicular essence preparation for men, "Body-Con." French Dr. Flandin has chemically verified that "Body-Con" is the most effective medicine for kidney deficiency and anemia. Other famous Italian doctors, such as Dr. Stockholm, have used this preparation to cure 3,000 critically ill cases of kidney deficiency, so it is called the most perfect health medicine in the world. It also has the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting fertility for women, and results can be seen in one box.

Discussion on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Colds and Coughs
Lung Disease Expert Physician Sheng Zaiqiang

During this cold season, it is easiest to catch a cold. One may suffer from this disease if one wears too little clothing or feels cold at night. Initially, there will be nasal congestion and excessive nasal discharge, headache and cough, hoarseness, phlegm that is difficult to expectorate, and wheezing. Gradually, it can lead to hemoptysis and become pulmonary tuberculosis. I have been practicing medicine for many years, and those who do not actively treat stomach colds and coughs often have poor outcomes. The lungs are delicate organs that absolutely cannot be subjected to adverse external stimuli. The study of this type of pathology must be thorough. However, the general public is indifferent and neglectful of influenza, and uses syrups and pear pastes for coughs, hoping to achieve temporary relief, which is even more misleading. Because using these methods does not address the root cause, but is harmful to the patient's treatment and will only increase the deterioration of the disease. Therefore, for the treatment of coughs, I believe that a cough-suppressing treatment that is effective immediately is necessary. Because if this type of treatment is not used, the hateful cough will definitely continue, and it will turn into terrible pulmonary tuberculosis. Treating it or not treating it will have the same result, and it will only waste useful money and delay the period.

Based on my many years of experience, only taking the lung disease special medicine "Pulmonal" is the most effective, because "Pulmonal" has been unanimously recognized by many lung disease experts in various countries as "Pulmonal" is the only effective medicine to relieve the pain of cough from the root cause. This preparation has the effect of suppressing cough and relieving cough, and it also promotes appetite, provides nutrition, and fully compensates for those who are consumed by cough, etc.; in addition, "Pulmonal" has a magical effect on senile asthma and infantile whooping cough. This is my many years of experience, and it is also the experience publicly proven by international experts.

Nocturnal Emission Due to Congenital Weakness
German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

In studying the various causes of nocturnal emission, most people believe that it is caused by recent masturbation, but in fact, the causes of nocturnal emission are not limited to this. All congenital deficiencies can easily cause nocturnal emission. After nocturnal emission, the body becomes weaker and weaker. Over time, the semen will flow out naturally after working during the day. The continuous leakage of semen not only damages the body and depletes the spirit, but also causes nocturnal emission to linger. Therefore, physical weakness and nocturnal emission are in a state of mutual causation. To reverse this trend, one should proceed from consolidating the sperm gate and nourishing the deficiency. To achieve great results in both aspects, one must take "Nires Nocturnal Emission Pills" and "Body-Con." "Nires Nocturnal Emission Pills" are the most reliable medicine for treating nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea. "Body-Con" is the most ideal preparation for nourishing deficiency and promoting development. Taking it continuously for one winter will prosper the five organs and improve the brain power.

Special Treatment for Gonorrhea
American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang

I have been conducting clinical experiments on gonorrhea for many years, and the one that I admire and love the most is the German special medicine for gonorrhea "Klinon." The quality is pure and good, without any hegemonic side effects, because the various valuable ingredients it is formulated with are completely different from ordinary over-the-counter medicines on the market, which only consider the current benefits and cause stomach upset and vomiting, and stimulate the kidneys. "Klinon" mainly works on the lesions after taking it, and does not harm other healthy parts at all. Although there are many internal medicines with this characteristic now, they cannot be compared with it, so this preparation has remarkable effects of reducing inflammation, relieving pain, sterilizing, and clearing turbidity and promoting diuresis. Its medicinal power can completely eliminate all new and old gonorrhea, including the gonococci hidden deep in the urethra and the submucosa. All those who have not been cured by taking other medicines or undergoing surgery by local doctors can be completely cured by taking this preparation.

Gonorrhea Lecture
The Consequences of Gonococcal Orchitis
Written by Physician Yao Juyan
Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

Leukorrhea: many have poor prognoses: and gonococcal orchitis is especially common among those who suffer from gonorrhea but do not receive treatment. Originally, gonorrhea patients should implement a firm defense in the acute stage, and quickly eliminate the gonococci in the anterior urethra, so that there will be no worries about invading the posterior urethra, and even more so about invading the prostate and testicles. Therefore, the symptom of orchitis will definitely not continue to develop: but there is something regrettable, that is, gonorrhea in the acute stage is treated by unscientific doctors and exaggerated advertisements, and patients are deceived and do not know it. The more they take such inferior medicines, the worse they get, and the more they use such surgeries, the more the virus spreads internally. As a result, gonorrhea patients unknowingly turn into posterior urethritis, prostatitis, epididymitis, etc. Once orchitis is successfully established, gonorrhea patients will produce truly tragic consequences, because the epididymis is an extremely important organ for producing sperm. Once it is invaded by gonorrhea, it will lose this sacred work, so those who suffer from this disease often have the danger of infertility.

For the treatment of this disease, the most reliable decision is to take gonorrhea sacrament "Klinon," which allows the sterilization power to directly reach the lesion, so that the gonorrhea virus will no longer continue to implement its plan to destroy the testicular tissue. On the one hand, the German inductive electrostatic therapy and anti-gonorrhea serum Wetterer X therapy are used, so that the gonorrhea pathogens have nowhere to hide and can be quickly cured. According to my many years of experience, all gonococcal orchitis treated with such scientific methods, and the testicles have not reached the stalemate of solidification, can be ensured a complete solution and restore their original health.

Past Two Weeks
The problem of small change in this city has not been completely resolved. In recent days, there has been another shortage of dime coins, which is obviously the result of unscrupulous merchants manipulating and profiting from it. But their manipulation is bound to fail. We don't need to panic, otherwise we will fall for their tricks! (1) Because the supply of dime coins in the occupied areas has reached saturation. There is definitely no prospect of continued outflow. (2) Because the end of the year is approaching, residents from various places will definitely come to Shanghai to purchase goods, and dime coins will definitely reappear in Shanghai. (3) Because the Bank of China has a large amount of dime coins in its reserves, and the general financial industry also has a large amount of dime coins to cope with. (4) Because the printing cost of dime notes is low, it does not attract people's investment like the division notes. (5) Because the issuance of division notes is a new system, it must go through legislative procedures, which creates a period of panic when there is a lack of continuity. Dime notes have been circulating for a long time, and many local banks have dime notes issued. Therefore, there is no danger of dime notes being exhausted; this can be asserted.

Kenjiro Yuer Qianji came to China again on the 21st, and it is said that he will discuss specific plans for "economic cooperation" with the brewing "new central regime." Three years ago, this man brought a policy of national subjugation of "industrial Japan, agricultural China," but he had to return in disappointment after being unanimously and sternly rejected by the entire country. Now, although there is a group of scum who may wave the flag for him, the scum themselves have no foothold, and this man's activities will still return quietly. (Fang Yifang)

A Corner of Society Sweeping for Rice
By: Qi

The source of food has been very smooth these past two days. According to reports, more than 48,000 bags of foreign rice arrived in port in four days. In theory, the price of rice should have fallen by several yuan, but no, the price is still hovering above 35 yuan and refuses to fall, causing the average citizen to cry out in pain. Thus, the shantytown class, who were already tightening their belts, have no choice but to resort to stealing.

"Woo..." A truck loaded with goods from afar approached and gradually stopped. On it was a precious gift for the common people - bags of flattened rice. When the people on the truck and the clerks in the rice store were carrying the bags of rice down, the poor people who had been waiting on the side of the road immediately swarmed up and surrounded the truck.

This group of people numbered about twenty, all with sallow faces, dressed in clothes patched upon patched, with a cloth bag tied around their waists, a small broom in their right hands, and a small lead skin dustpan in their left hands. With these two simple tools, they could sweep up the rice grains without spending a penny. Sometimes, if they were lucky, they could sweep up more than a liter.

Whenever a bag of rice was carried away, a gap was revealed on the truck, and they scrambled even more to sweep. Some leaned on the truck boards and scraped with their hands. There wasn't much rice left, but after this scavenging, it was all gone. Then they poured all the rice grains in their dustpans into their cloth bags, grinning like triumphant warriors, watched by the envious eyes of their companions, because their hands and feet were more nimble than others.

This situation obviously had a phenomenon of "more monks than gruel." Those who were close to the truck gained priority. Those who were far away, seeing their chance lost, sneaked behind the truck, watching when the people on the truck weren't paying attention, and dug their fingers into the seams of the rice sacks. After a few digs, a small hole the size of a finger was widened, and the rice poured out like a spring. The people below only needed to open their bags and receive it, wouldn't they return with a full load? But did you think of something that others wouldn't? There

### Finland's Authorities Request the League of Nations to Handle; Finnish Labor Circles Declare Support for the Current Government

Helsinki: Finland's new cabinet decided yesterday to appeal to the League of Nations regarding the Soviet-Finnish conflict, in accordance with Articles 11 and 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. (Reuters telegram, 3rd)

Geneva: Finland's representative to the League of Nations, Mr. Yrjö Eero Ryti, met with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, at noon today, informing him that the Finnish government had decided to request an immediate convening of the League of Nations Council and Assembly to discuss the dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union, in accordance with Articles 11 and 15 of the Covenant. The formal note presented by the Finnish government will be delivered to Avenol this evening. (Havas telegram, 3rd)

Helsinki: The Social Democratic Party and the Federation of Trade Unions jointly issued a declaration this morning, supporting the current government, stating: "We are representatives of the working class of the whole country. At this time of national crisis, we dare to announce to the people of the country: 'The Ryti Cabinet, recently formed and supported by the elected parliament, is the only government with the right to represent the Finnish nation. Our country sincerely desires to restore peace, but if the aggressors disregard the true value of our peaceful intentions, the workers of our country will take up arms to defend national peace, democracy, and the right to national self-determination, and fight against violence.'" (Havas telegram, 3rd)

London: A spokesperson for the Finnish Legation in London recently made a statement to the press, saying, "We are forced to fight. The entire nation is united. The attitude adopted by the previous government during negotiations with the Soviet Union never caused opposition within the country. The current government's attitude is exactly the same as the previous government's, and it is dealing with the various demands made by the Soviet Union with the same spirit of compromise. We have painfully accepted two-thirds of the demands made by the Soviet Union. Not only have we agreed to cede some territory, but we have also repeatedly urged the Soviet Union to quickly reach a solution. However, if our independence and freedom are harmed as a result, it is something we cannot accept. We are determined to fight to the end to maintain our freedom. As for the provisional government created by the Soviet Union, it is still within Soviet territory, located eight kilometers from our border, and absolutely cannot represent the people of our country. This government is also composed of communists, but there is no so-called communist party within our country. As for the military situation, the Soviet army has only achieved some success in the north of our country. In other places, they have been repelled by our army. The country's troops have never crossed our border by more than two kilometers. Our air force shot down several Soviet planes built with British and American machine guns on the 1st of this month."

Stockholm: Rumors arose here yesterday afternoon, some saying that Sweden would declare war on the Soviet Union, and others saying that Sweden would send an expeditionary force to Finland. There were many rumors. By the evening, it was learned from reliable sources that the Swedish Council of State had decided to reorganize the government. This has been confirmed by government officials. The plan is to form a national unity cabinet, with the current Prime Minister Hansson continuing as Prime Minister, but Foreign Minister Sandler will certainly resign. This reorganization may be realized by tomorrow at the latest. (Haitong telegram, 3rd)

Stockholm: Regarding the reorganization of the Swedish government and the imminent resignation of Foreign Minister Sandler, reliable sources here have revealed that the reason is that in the past few months, Sandler had strongly urged Finland to trust Britain and take a hard line against the Soviet Union and Germany. The result of the current Soviet-Finnish conflict is that the Swedish Foreign Minister's policy will greatly disappoint the public, so it is unlikely that he will continue in the government after the reorganization. Observers here point out that the pro-British policies of the Nordic countries will be forced to abandon in the future, because the power of the Soviet Union has occupied a special position.

### Raising the Banner of the Crusades, Britain is Truly Fighting for International Justice; Eden's Speech Accuses Germany of Abandoning Faithfulness; Confident that the Allied British and French Forces Will Win

London: Minister for the Dominions, Eden, delivered a speech in Warwick tonight, stating, "This war is only 20 years away from the last Great War. We must never forget this. Europe should not have to experience a decisive war every twenty years. Germany was originally a powerful country. For many years, it has used its national resources and entire economic organization to strengthen its military and prepare for war. Its method of warfare is also cruel and inhumane. Therefore, we have a major responsibility at the present time, which we must not take lightly. It should be known that this war was not caused by a conflict of ambitions between the two sides. We do not want to seize any new rights, nor do we intend to open up new territories. The reason why we have to fight is nothing more than to strive for peace, freedom, development of industry and commerce, and improvement of living standards for our country and other nations, large and small. From this, it can be seen that the nature of this war is very different from ordinary wars. It is truly a crusade to establish international justice.

Since Germany has repeatedly abandoned faithfulness and invaded weak nations, the standard of international life has deteriorated day by day. If this is allowed to continue, its only destination will be the formation of anarchy in the world, where people cannot live and no country can be spared. Our war objective is to prevent this from happening. Before and after the start of the war, the National Socialist propaganda machine targeted our country, especially certain leaders of our country, as its targets of attack. I am not saddened by this trick, and I think it is enough to compliment us. The policies, methods, and life concepts of that National Socialist Germany run counter to those of the British Empire. If we allow Germany to control Europe, it is not difficult to imagine what the fate of Europe will be. Especially when faced with this situation, the British people must do their best and never allow the terrorist methods used by the German political police to gain an advantage.

What Germany wants to defeat is the power of the British Empire. That country launched the Great War in 1914, originally wanting to establish military hegemony. This time, it launched the war for the same goal. Hitler is not a person who is superior to the masses in any way. He is merely the most recent representative of Prussian militarism. His goals are no different from those of Bismarck and the deposed Emperor Wilhelm II. But this person is not Prussian, so what he shows is truly bad."

At this point, Eden praised the happy situation and camaraderie of the British and French Allied forces at all levels on the front line (note that Eden accompanied representatives from various dominions to inspect the Maginot Line), and expressed his admiration for the French army, saying, "France has made extremely great achievements in the military field, which is enough to be shocking and cannot be described in words. I firmly believe that there is no army in the world that is superior to the French army. After we visited the great defensive works (referring to the Maginot Line) and returned to our country, we firmly believe that the German army will never be able to break through our defense line. France has spared huge sums of money to build this defense line, which has become a shield for Britain and France. For us, we cannot express our gratitude enough. In addition, the achievements of the British and French navies and merchant fleets are also commendable. In short, our current responsibility is extremely arduous and must not be taken lightly. In our country, the authorities would rather show the truth and jointly shoulder the responsibility of coping. Especially the final result of the war, who wins and who loses, there is no doubt. What we should strive for is to go further and think about the future, that is, after this experience and making such great sacrifices, we must establish a better order for the world."
