Declaration of the Conference

Chongqing – The Sixth Plenary Session issued a declaration, beginning by stating that the Sixth Plenary Session was convened on the anniversary of the late Premier's birth, and listened to reports from the Party Affairs, Military Affairs, and Political Affairs departments. It deeply appreciated the bravery of the soldiers at the front, the resilience of the people in the war zones, and the efforts of the responsible personnel in the rear, which were all great. The conference paid tribute to the officers and soldiers who died in battle, expressed condolences to the soldiers, and admired the overseas compatriots. Regarding the relief and resettlement of the affected compatriots and the education and care of the families of military personnel, proposals have been made to urge the government to implement them. At the opening of the conference, the President gave detailed instructions, which further confirmed the principle that the War of Resistance is consistent with world security. The discussions of the conference over the past week have focused on accelerating the laying of the foundation for national reconstruction, and it is hoped that the compatriots will wholeheartedly consider from the long-term foundation of national establishment, and exert all the thoughts and talents of the country to promote the work of national reconstruction. Secondly, the declaration discusses the current priorities: (1) The revolutionary mission of our party is to save the country and build the nation, in order to seek national independence and equality. The national policy of resistance was determined at the Fifth National Congress in the twenty-fourth year, with ten declarations, which are the political program of our party and the goals of resistance and nation-building. The first is to promote morality to invigorate the people's hearts; the second is to promote practical learning to lay the foundation of the country; the third is to promote education to cultivate the people's strength; the fourth is to enrich the economy to benefit the people's livelihood; the fifth is to carefully examine personnel and strictly evaluate performance to establish the foundation of the state's employment and administration; the sixth is to respect the judiciary and lighten litigation to protect the people's lives and property rights; the seventh is to emphasize supervision and encourage censors to rectify officialdom and extend public opinion; the eighth is to value border administration and promote education to strengthen the nation and achieve unification; the ninth is to open constitutional rule and reform internal affairs to establish the foundation of the country; the tenth is to strictly abide by the late Premier's teachings, restore national self-reliance, establish proper foreign relations, maintain the dignity of national equality and independence, and achieve the goal of world harmony. This meeting specifically mentioned this article to remind the entire party to pay attention. This general draft has already been determined, and it is hoped that all compatriots across the country will abide by it. (2) The most important resolution of this meeting internally is to schedule the convocation of the National Assembly and to accelerate the promotion of county-level construction. This conference has resolved to convene the National Assembly in 1940 in order to formulate a constitution as soon as possible. During this period, it is hoped that the people of the country will work together to achieve victory in the War of Resistance, to protect the country's independence, freedom, and equality, and to protect the freedom and interests of all individuals.

It is hoped that the entire country will promote it.

Finally, he expressed gratitude for the assistance and relief of refugees from various countries, and hoped that all peace-loving forces in the world will work together to establish a collective security organization. He ended by mentioning the increasing difficulties and responsibilities in the future, which must be bravely shouldered. Materials should be contributed in unison, and intelligence and skills should be used well to increase production. Everyone must adhere to the creed of the nation above all and the nation above all, and the people themselves must cultivate morality, righteousness, integrity, and shame, in order to clarify the distinction between right and wrong. The people must be responsible to the country and abide by discipline. All my compatriots, may you be diligent and courageous in fulfilling your duties. (20th Dispatch)

### Japanese Troops Advancing North from Qinzhou Encounter Increasingly Fierce Resistance from Chinese Forces; Front-Line Positions of Chinese Forces are Solid; Reports of Japanese Troops Reaching Datang are Inaccurate

Chongqing – Several days have passed since the Japanese troops landed in Qinzhou Bay west of Beihai. The purpose of the Japanese offensive has not been determined. Nanning seems to be the objective of the Japanese offensive, as it is the transportation hub of Guangxi Province. The Japanese troops advancing north from Qinzhou, along the mountainous border between Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, are not far from the foothills. However, the deeper the troops penetrate inland, the fiercer the resistance they encounter from Chinese forces. It is impossible for them to make a swift advance. (20th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)

Chongqing – According to a Central News Agency report today, two squadrons of Japanese aircraft attacked Nanning yesterday. Japanese planes appeared over Nanning at 3:00 PM yesterday, dropping several tons of heavy bombs and incendiary bombs. According to Chinese reports, the Japanese army currently has 2,000 troops stationed in Fangcheng and Qinzhou, while the main force is advancing along the highway to Nanning. During the heavy rains of the past two days, the military position of the Chinese Southern Front has been solidified. (20th Associated Press Dispatch)

Chongqing – According to sources here today, Japanese troops landed again yesterday at several locations near Beihai, a few miles away. However, details are currently unknown. According to a South China correspondent for the Ta Kung Pao, Japanese troops have not reached Datang, which is fifty miles away from Nanning. The Japanese propaganda is completely inaccurate, and the Japanese advance is not from Qinzhou, but directly from Fangcheng, bypassing the shortcut north. (20th Associated Press Dispatch)

Chongqing – According to the latest military news from Guangxi, the Japanese troops invading from Qinzhou are now not far from Nanning. Military sources here say this was expected, as Nanning is only a hundred miles from Beihai. It is reported that after the Japanese troops occupied Fangcheng and Qinzhou, they launched several routes north on the morning of the 18th of this month. Their vanguard seems to have crossed the border of Guangxi Province, as there were reports last night that Japanese troops were only eight miles from the border. Thirteen Japanese planes bombed Nanning in two groups yesterday afternoon, dropping multiple strong explosive and incendiary bombs. General Bai Chongxi, Chief of the General Staff and Director of the Southwest Headquarters, is currently in Chongqing attending the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee meeting and will not return to Guilin immediately, indicating that the Chinese military commander is confident in the war situation in Guangxi Province. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

Guilin – At around 8:00 AM on the 18th, the Japanese troops advancing north from Qinzhou encountered Chinese troops at Jiulongxu ("northeast of Qinzhou"), and a fierce battle ensued. Chinese troops fought bravely, and the Japanese troops abandoned corpses all over the field and retreated to Qinzhou. By noon, there were no traces of the Japanese troops around Jiulong and Niufan. (20th Dispatch)

Sihui – More than 300 Japanese troops from Xinping in the southwest raided Minle City at dawn on the 18th. Chinese local forces bravely fought back. After a fierce battle until noon, the Japanese troops could not withstand the attack and retreated along their original route. (20th Dispatch)

Sihui – A squadron of Japanese troops from Sanshui scouted Huangtang and Xiaotang on the 16th, but were detected by Chinese troops who ambushed them at a certain location. When the Japanese troops approached, they suddenly attacked, killing or wounding more than a hundred Japanese soldiers and seizing many guns. (20th Dispatch)

Editorial

### Italy's Attitude Towards the Balkans

It has been a long time since we heard Mussolini's roar. Since the outbreak of World War II, Mussolini has remained neutral and impartial. The German explanation is that Italy's actions make it difficult for Britain and France to understand Italy's attitude, which is more beneficial to Germany. This is just a German excuse. In fact, Italy and Germany have long been out of alignment and are no longer bound by Germany. Of course, it cannot be said that Italy has turned to be pro-British and pro-French, but it wants to make a good deal out of the European war. Italy occupies an important position in the Mediterranean. Not only Germany has a need to rely on it, but Britain and France have also repeatedly tried to please it, so Italy takes advantage of its rarity and values itself. Of course, Italy's current relationship with Britain and France is no longer as contradictory as before. The withdrawal of Italian border troops from the French border and the re-appointment of Bascianini as the British ambassador indicate his friendly attitude towards Britain and France. However, this does not mean that he has given up his demands on Britain and France. Italy's inability to forget the French territories in the Mediterranean and North Africa can still be seen in the Italian newspaper Gazzetta del Popolo. Gazzetta recently said: "Italy expects the colonial problem to be resolved. Italy was sold by the Treaty of Versailles. The treaty did not give Italy any colonies. Italy's goal is the political and economic harmony of the Balkan countries, and the free and equal resolution of colonial issues. Prime Minister Mussolini's calm but armed peaceful policy is based on waiting and guarding." "Waiting and guarding" can really represent Italy's basic policy at present. The content of this statement is naturally not only addressed to Britain and France, but also to Germany and the Soviet Union. What is demanded from the former is naturally the colonial issue. The slogans of Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia have already given France a great impression. When Mussolini delivered an armed peace speech to tens of thousands of people on the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia in Rome this time, students shouted this slogan again. Even if it did not get a response from the crowd, an Italian observer stated that he has not given up his desire for French territories in the Mediterranean and North Africa, which shows that Italy is only waiting for an opportunity. As for now, he prefers to wait and see, because during the period when the two sides on the Western Front are facing each other without a clear winner, from Italy's standpoint, it is inconvenient to act rashly and lightly give up its neutral position that can influence the overall situation. This is one. With the status of a neutral country, it develops its foreign trade with both sides. Since the beginning of the war, it has been flourishing. Its newly opened air route has also passed through the Italian port of Naples and reached Australia via Dutch India. His commercial ships sailing to the East are crowded with passengers every time they depart, and the fare has increased by 50%. Undoubtedly, if Italy does not engage in war, it can gain a lot of benefits in trade and make it prosperous for a period of time. This is two.

However, Italy does not wait and see regarding the Balkan Peninsula. It has repeatedly stated that "Italy will not allow the Bolshevik Soviet Union to cross the Carpathian Mountains (on the former Czech border) and enter the Danube River basin, or sneak into the Mediterranean from the Balkans," and said that "The Communist Party hopes to use the revolutions of other countries to expand its power in the Balkans, then it is bound to conflict with Mussolini's doctrine and the Italian army." This shows that the Soviet Union is not allowed to interfere in the Balkan Peninsula. This kind of argument is better aimed at Germany than at the Soviet Union. Although Germany and Italy form an axis, their past interests in Central Europe and the Balkans have been conflicting. The formation of Hungary as a German vassal state and the inclusion of Austria into German territory are countries that Italy has historically regarded as its sphere of influence. Since the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact, Germany has become the nominal leader, and Italian diplomacy has followed Berlin's lead. All of Italy's interests in Central Europe have been invisibly deprived and encroached upon by Germany. This is something that Mussolini feels aggrieved and has no way to complain about. Now that Germany is close to the Soviet Union and is using all its strength to deal with Britain and France, it has no time to take care of the Balkans. Mussolini naturally believes that this is an excellent opportunity to restore Italy's position in the Balkans, so he uses the name of anti-communism to achieve his goal. Mussolini's loud call to prevent the Soviet Union from invading the Balkans is this kind of effect. As for how Italy will concretely launch its efforts in the Balkans, it probably has to wait until the European war reaches the second stage before it can be seen in real development!

### Japanese Lieutenant General Abe Dies in Battle Near Laiyuan; 6,000 Japanese Troops Attacking South from Laiyuan Fail; Hirata Sends Troops to Assist, Intercepted En Route

Luoyang – (Delayed) The Japanese Abe Independent Mixed Brigade sent troops from the Qiancun, Lüchuan, and Morita units, totaling 5,000-6,000, to attack south from Laiyuan in northwestern Hebei on the 3rd of this month. The Chinese army utilized the terrain, resolutely resisting on one side and sending strong forces to flank the Japanese from behind. After a day of fierce fighting, with dozens of hand-to-hand combats, the Japanese Qiancun units were almost completely annihilated. On the 4th, Japanese Brigade Commander Lieutenant General Abe Norihide personally led a portion of his troops to reinforce, but was again lured into the deep mountains by the Chinese army, heavily surrounded, and fiercely attacked. By noon, most of the Japanese troops had been annihilated, and Japanese General Abe was killed on the spot. Except for a portion of the remaining Japanese troops fleeing, the rest were annihilated. Japanese corpses were scattered throughout the valleys, and blood flowed like a river. The Chinese seized countless weapons, ammunition, and military supplies, which are being inventoried. Hirata Shun, the Japanese commander stationed in Beiping, upon hearing the news, urgently dispatched the Sangmu Division's Xinmei and Liuchuan infantry regiments, and the cavalry regiment of Tanabe from Yixian, Juxian, and Tangxian to Laiyuan to reinforce. Two of the regiments were intercepted by the Chinese army in Dafenggou, Jifang, and other places. The fighting continued until the morning of the 9th. By the time all of the Japanese troops arrived, the Chinese army had safely retreated. Lieutenant General Abe Norihide was from Aomori Prefecture, Japan, and graduated from the 19th class of the Military Academy. He served as a regimental commander, brigade commander, and independent brigade commander. He was known as a tactical expert and was one of the outstanding Japanese military commanders. He was promoted to lieutenant general on the 2nd of last month, and was killed by Chinese soldiers just over a month later. The Japanese army was shocked upon hearing the news. (25th Dispatch)

### Japanese Army's Attack on Northern Hubei and Northern Hunan Fails: Circumstances of the Failure; Strategic Errors Lead to Incomplete Success; Greater Losses Expected Afterwards; Interview of a Foreign Advisor with an American Reporter

Chongqing – A certain foreign advisor to the Chinese Central Army recently stated in an interview with an Associated Press reporter that the Japanese army’s recent offensives in China were akin to “forcing ignorant children to perform the work of adults,” causing the two Japanese invasions (of Northern Hubei and Northern Hunan) this year to end in incomplete success. Observing the future, the Japanese army will clearly suffer even heavier losses. This foreign advisor explained the Japanese army's strategy during the invasion of Changsha, saying that the Japanese army used a force of five divisions, but without the support of artillery regiments and tanks. Their front line stretched from east of Dongting Lake to Nanchang, a total of 250 miles. At the same time, the Japanese army dispatched four teams to advance on separate routes, attempting to converge in the Changsha area. At that time, the Chinese army defending against the Japanese advance consisted of sixteen divisions, their numbers equal to the Japanese army, and they finally repelled the invading Japanese army. Also, in April of that year, when the Japanese army attempted to encircle the Chinese army in the Northern Hubei and Southern Henan areas, the Japanese army used most of four divisions and one cavalry brigade. At that time, the Chinese forces responsible for defending against the Japanese invasion were five elite divisions of the Guangxi Army, commanded by General Li Zongren, supplemented by well-trained mobile units and guerrillas. They also defeated the Japanese army, achieving an unprecedented victory. In these two battles, the Japanese army initially made good progress. The Japanese army advancing on Southern Henan and Northern Hubei reached Tongbai in Southern Henan at one point, which was one of the Japanese army's objectives. However, two days later, these Japanese troops finally collapsed in two directions, retreating to the south and east. At that time, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, with thousands of people abandoned on the battlefield because they could not be transported away. A Japanese regiment was trapped in the Dabie Mountain area and almost failed to break through. When the Japanese army attacked Northern Hunan, it started on September 18. Initially, three Japanese divisions, under the cover of heavy artillery and air force, tried to cross the Xinqiang River, intending to head south to Changsha. At that time, the battle was fierce. According to General Guan Linzheng, commander-in-chief of a certain Chinese army group, although the Chinese army suffered heavy attacks from the Japanese army for six days, it still stood firm. Later, because the Japanese army landed in Yingtian on the south bank of Dongting Lake, the left flank of the Chinese army felt threatened. Also, if the Japanese army's roundabout movement succeeded, the retreat route of the Chinese army fighting along the Xinqiang River would be cut off. Therefore, the Chinese army then obeyed the order of Chairman Chiang and retreated south at night, but at the same time dispatched two Chinese divisions to outflank both sides of the Japanese army's advance route. In this battle, by September 30, the Japanese army was about 20 miles away from Changsha. On October 2, after a large-scale encirclement by the Chinese army, the Japanese army finally began to collapse and retreat north. On October 7, the right flank of the Japanese army fighting along the Yuehan Railway and the left flank of the Japanese army advancing southwest from Fengxin in Northern Jiangxi were also forced to collapse. According to General Li Zongren's post-war statement, when the Japanese army entered the Chinese army's position in Northern Hubei, the Chinese army implemented a scorched earth policy, leaving only houses and trees, which finally caused the Japanese army to collapse. Also, according to foreign residents living in Changsha, when the Japanese army attacked the area, the civilians in the city had already evacuated by September 25, and the Chinese army was prepared to set fire to the remaining houses if necessary, but the Japanese army collapsed before reaching Changsha. In both of the above two major battles, when the Japanese army had its target in sight, it immediately implemented an "about face" and retreated to its original position. According to the foreign advisor, the Japanese army's situation at that time was that it had to withdraw, otherwise it was in danger of being annihilated by the Chinese army. At that time, the Chinese regular army had surrounded the forward columns of the Japanese army, and the guerrillas were attacking the Japanese army's supply base and transportation lines, causing the advancing Japanese army to lose contact and fall into a state of fighting on its own. Furthermore, because of the difficult transportation in the mountainous area and the cutoff of reinforcements, it suffered a disastrous defeat. The foreign advisor jokingly said to the reporter, "How can an ignorant child be competent for the work of an adult? When they realize that they are not competent, they have no choice but to go home." The foreign advisor's comment on the reason why the Chinese army failed to expand its original front line after winning the victory was said to be "mainly because the Chinese army lacked war materials. When the Japanese army retreated to its original position, the Japanese army defended the fortresses built last year to block the Chinese army's advance. These fortresses were Chinese old cities. Rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades can stop the Japanese army from attacking without heavy artillery, but these light weapons are not enough to destroy the fortresses. Although the Chinese army currently has 1.5 million front-line troops that can be driven, they are unwilling to make meaningless sacrifices of great manpower. Therefore, the 800,000 Japanese troops south of the Great Wall can hold a front line of 2,000 miles, occupying an area of 650,000 square miles. Although the Chinese army has cut off the Japanese army's front line in many places, the Japanese army can still continue to occupy its walled cities and continue to transport supplies and munitions to Central China via the Yangtze River, and from Tianjin and Qingdao to various parts of North China. This is because the Japanese army often relies on superior weapons." According to reports from the Chinese side, the Japanese army's recruitment of Chinese people to fight against the Chinese army together with the Japanese army has not been successful. The number of puppet troops participating in the Battle of Changsha was 18,000, and the same was true for those participating in the Battle of Northern Hubei. However, the Japanese army did not allow the puppet troops to fight independently, but only as auxiliary troops of the Japanese army. At that time, Chongqing received almost daily news of puppet troops defecting. If one-tenth of the reports received were true, then the Japanese army's attempt to use Chinese to control Chinese would undoubtedly fail. General Li Zongren once told reporters that the Chinese army's recapture of Lanfeng in Eastern Henan was due to the defection of the puppet troops. The puppet troops opened the city gates wide and invited the Chinese army into the city. Under the same circumstances, the Chinese army was able to successfully recapture cities in various places due to the defection of the puppet troops. However, the Chinese army retreated to its original position after inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese army or when Japanese reinforcements arrived, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. The highest Chinese military authorities also admitted that if the Japanese army was willing to concentrate a large number of divisions in one position, the Japanese army would be quite capable of occupying any stronghold they wanted to occupy. When the Japanese army rushed from Nanchang along the Xianggan Highway to Changsha, and cooperated with the Japanese army advancing along the Xiang River to attack, the situation was particularly difficult for the Chinese army defending Changsha to hold on to. However, the Japanese army failed as a result of strategic errors. Also, the Japanese army could attack Shaanxi from Henan, and the Japanese army in the southwest could attack Nanning in Guangxi Province from Beihai, but the Japanese army's strength could not realize this hope. Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin told reporters that although the Japanese army could advance, "it would encounter extreme danger due to the insecurity of the transportation lines." He explained that the difficulties in strategy and tactics, including the mountainous terrain and the increased activity of guerrillas, were the main factors hindering the Japanese army. According to the opinions of most military observers, if Japan cannot dispatch several divisions of elite Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria and make efforts to mobilize all its troops in Japan, it will never be able to inflict a fatal blow on the Chinese army, and the Sino-Japanese war cannot be ended. This is because the Japanese army must crush the main force of the Chinese army before it can end the Sino-Japanese war. They also believe that Japan cannot implement the above steps unless Japan can sign an agreement with the Soviet Union, but even so, the Japanese Kwantung Army is still skeptical of the Soviet Union's actions and will certainly not risk dispatching the Kwantung Army to take action against China. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese war has now fallen into the stalemate that military observers had predicted a year ago. Although the Chinese army currently lacks military equipment to drive out the Japanese army in the fortress area, the Japanese army also lacks the strength to end the war of aggression against China. The sudden changes in the current international situation or the increase in anti-war sentiment in the Japanese army seem to be the only way to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. Otherwise, unless the two countries are willing to stop the war in the current conflict and convene a conference to resolve the disputes between the two countries, Japan's so-called end to the war of aggression against China is just a dream.

Chicago – After the German authorities in the Czech Republic shot nine Czech students, the Czech National Association here issued a statement saying, "These students protested because the National Socialist Germany implemented oppressive measures and the Czechs were reduced to slaves. They were brutally murdered without any other crimes. There is nothing more tragic than this. All Americans are requested to unite with us and publicly protest against this German act." (Havas cable on the 19th)

London – The oppressive measures taken by the German authorities in Bohemia and Moravia have been severely criticized by the newspapers here. The Times reported, "The events in Prague a few days ago prove again that Germany has no ability to rule foreign nations. This nation, which bullies the weak, intends to eliminate spiritual life even within its own borders, let alone abroad. The Czech nation has always respected morality and is rich in national spirit, and should rise up to resist it. The Czechs are fighting for freedom of speech, freedom of political life, and the security and independence of small countries, even if they suffer pain. These freedoms are what Britain and France and the British Dominions are determined to restore." The Daily Herald reported, "The rampant spread of this kind of terror in Central Europe will not be tolerated by the nations. We hereby express our respect to the brave Czechs."

London – Dominion Secretary Eden, along with representatives from the various Dominions and the Indian government, has returned here after visiting the Maginot Line in France. He gave a broadcast speech to the French people in French in the evening, saying, "Although this trip was very short, I went to the front line to meet with my French comrades. Among our group, there are many veterans of the last European war. Recalling the situation 20 years ago, I can't help but be fascinated. When we visited France this time, we saw people everywhere, regardless of men, women, old or young, who were calm and determined. Since the outbreak of this war, France has not been as excited as it was during the last European war. We do not see people holding demonstrations or marching in groups, and we do not see soldiers decorating their bayonets with flowers. However, this is precisely the evidence that we know what war is based on experience. After all, fighting is not a matter of luck, and it must be dealt with calmly and practically in order to be successful. The French people have now made a decision to ensure that repeated wars of aggression never happen again. We can feel this determination everywhere we go. In short, the French people are deeply convinced that the Anglo-French Allied Forces will achieve final victory. The expeditionary force in our country is also high-spirited, and the overall morale of the officers and soldiers is very good. Their numbers are increasing day by day and will continue to be replenished in the future. Our troops have made significant progress in reinforcing defenses and improving military equipment in the defense zone. In addition, we have also visited the Maginot Line. This line is currently being defended by the most elite army in the world. Their calmness, bravery, and fully effective training cannot be matched by any country's army. The world knows that the French nation has made heavy sacrifices in finances and materials to complete this line. Today, all nations that love freedom deeply appreciate France's unbreakable line of defense and the French troops stationed there. If France had not shown a determined spirit to complete its national defense organization in recent years, it is not difficult for us to imagine what the situation of the war would be today. All civilized countries in the world have once again benefited from France's generosity. This should be written and highlighted in human history." (Havas cable on the 19th)

### Soviet Cavalry Celebrates 20th Anniversary; Enthusiastic Celebrations Throughout the Country

Moscow – Today is the 20th anniversary of the First Cavalry Army, and the Soviet Red Army and the people of the whole country are celebrating it together. Celebratory meetings have been held in various troops, clubs, factories and collective farms. The Don Province, as the birthplace of the army and the hometown of many of its participating soldiers, is particularly enthusiastic in its celebrations. There are liaison meetings of veterans personally led by Budyonny, mass rallies, and equestrian competitions. Today, national newspapers have published special editions commemorating the anniversary, publishing articles and photos related to the First Army. Pravda published Stalin's congratulatory message to the officers and soldiers of the army, and the order to the army from the National Defense Commissar Marshal Voroshilov on that day. Voroshilov's order stated, "The First Cavalry Army has extremely high organizational and political consciousness. The entire army is unanimously loyal to the people and the cause of the socialist revolution. It has also been forged into an excellent discipline and order in the revolutionary war, so it is invincible and has repeatedly achieved combat feats. Lenin himself paid very close attention to and valued it. The army was entirely under the command of Stalin himself from its establishment to the end of the civil war, so Stalin attached great importance to it during the civil war and still does now. The traditional spirit of the First Army permeates the entire Red Army cavalry. This point has been confirmed by the campaign to liberate the fellow countrymen oppressed by the Polish landlords in Western Ukraine and Western Belarus. In this campaign, our mechanized cavalry used lightning-fast marches, marching 100 kilometers a day, to implement raid and encirclement maneuvers to oppress and destroy the enemy, leaving them no time to rest and reorganize. This kind of initiative, along with the sophisticated cooperation of infantry and other mechanized units, as well as the spirit of bravery and boldness, is the tradition of the First Cavalry Army and the main reason why our entire Red Army is powerful and invincible."

### Increasing Difficulties in German-Soviet Trade Negotiations

Stockholm, Sweden – A correspondent for the Stockholm Daily News in Moscow reports that German-Soviet trade negotiations, ongoing for two months, are facing increasing difficulties. Certain products, such as metals, are urgently needed by German military industries, but the Soviet Union, needing to satisfy its own domestic requirements, refuses to export them. Furthermore, Soviet metal production this year is lower than in previous years, with several iron factories already having ceased operations. Unable to meet its own needs, the Soviet Union cannot spare resources to supply Germany. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

The issue of pre-war delivery contracts remains unresolved. The British argue that, due to changing circumstances, they cannot accept goods ordered by Britain in Switzerland before September 2nd, as Britain has placed many orders in other countries as well. Opening this precedent would be difficult for Britain to manage. The correspondent believes that Britain's refusal to accept pre-war orders will inflict a severe economic blow on Switzerland.

### British Economist Keynes Advocates Compulsory Savings System: Intended to Prevent Continued Wartime Price Increases

London – To cope with war expenses, the British government must make great efforts in finance. As a result, the domestic economy is bound to fall into an abnormal state. Therefore, economic experts generally believe that the government should not only raise war funds at this time, but also look ahead and consider the post-war economic situation. After all, price increases are inevitable during wartime (according to reports, British prices have risen by 6% in the first month of the war, and are expected to rise by 20% soon). Wage increases due to high prices are also unavoidable. In this vicious cycle, the government will ultimately have to implement an inflationary policy to meet urgent needs. However, the result of implementing an inflationary policy during wartime will inevitably lead to a forced contraction policy after the war. If so, all the adverse consequences will erupt after the war, just as after the last European war. Regarding this point, the famous economist Keynes recently proposed a plan advocating the implementation of a "compulsory savings system" during wartime to remedy the situation. In his view, after the implementation of this plan, it can prevent continued price increases at present and protect the national economy after the war from falling rapidly. The method is to still pay the wages of workers across the country according to the increased standard, but not to pay all of them in cash. Part of it should be transferred to the Post Office Savings Bureau, so as not to be completely spent, and at the same time, various items will not continue to rise in price due to excessive demand. In other words, although workers across the country will receive the benefit of increased wages during the war, they must not spend all of them, so that they can save part of their savings for spending after the war. In this way, after the military industry stops production after the war, various non-wartime industries can gradually recover, and because people still have savings to use, there is no need to worry that no one will buy the products of various industries at that time, and there is no need to be forced to implement a contraction policy immediately after the war. The main significance of the "compulsory savings system" lies in this. The amount of compulsory savings should be determined based on the amount of each person's income. Those with income below the minimum level are exempt from this obligation, and for those with higher incomes, the percentage should be increased proportionally. This savings should be interest-bearing at half a percent per annum, and depositors should not be allowed to withdraw this deposit before the end of the war, except for special reasons.

Danzig – The Berliner Zeitung reports that Germany has compiled a second list of British and French merchant ships, including 58 British ships and 8 French ships, stating that the ships listed are all equipped with anti-submarine weapons.

Amsterdam – The unfortunate incident of the Dutch ship Simon Bolivar hitting a torpedo has raised the question of why Dutch merchant ships are not equipped with torpedo sweepers. At the beginning of the European war, the Ministry of Defense suggested that large merchant ships should have this equipment to reduce the danger of triggering torpedoes. At the same time, naval experts re-examined this type of sweeper, but due to the high cost, shipowners have not adopted it. It is believed that after this loss, shipowners may change their attitude.

A spokesman for the company to which the ship belongs said, "This ship is owned by Dutch people and sails between Rotterdam, Netherlands and New York, USA. It is not yet known why Germany now regards it as an armed warship of a belligerent country. The government has made representations to Germany for explanation." (Havas dispatch, 20th)

London – The fishing boat Wigmore sank after hitting a mine in the North Sea today. It is reported that all sixteen crew members are missing. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Oslo – People here have a deep impression of the sinking of the Dutch ship Simon Bolivar and other neutral ships hitting mines this weekend. The Tidens Tegn newspaper commented on this matter, saying that such a strategy prevents neutral ships from sailing in various oceans, and special methods must be taken to deal with it. The group represented by the various neutral countries cannot be ignored by the belligerent countries, and it is necessary for the countries to clarify their position as soon as possible, so that the principle of maritime neutrality can be determined as a result. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

London – According to naval sources here today, six ships were sunk in the past week, indicating that Germany's maritime offensive is beginning to become active again. The sinking of these ships is mostly due to mines, but these mines were definitely not drifting randomly into the ships' routes, but were carefully arranged beforehand. According to survivors, these mines seem to be connected in pairs by iron wires, so after one side of the ship hits a mine, the other side will inevitably hit a mine as well. In addition, there are a large number of these mines drifting at sea, some of which have drifted to the British coast. According to the British Navy, these mines are definitely not British mines, because the structure of British mines automatically loses their explosive power once they break free and drift. According to reports, six ships were sunk last week: (1) the Dutch ship Simon Bolivar; (2) the Swedish ship Borejesson; (3) the British ship Blackhill; (4) the Italian ship Grazia; (5) the Yugoslav ship Galiga Milica; (6) the Lithuanian ship Donas.

The Basel News and the Swiss Daily News both stated, "When the anti-aircraft shells from the German border fell into our country, the Basel authorities did not issue an alarm, and then tried to cover it up, which is not right." The Basel News also asked the government to conduct an investigation, and said, "German planes have repeatedly invaded our airspace, and the ambassador to Germany has been ordered to protest, and officials should also issue a statement." The Swiss Daily News said, "This case should be submitted to the Federal Assembly for discussion." (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### The United States Has No Ambitions for Colonies

Washington – According to Mr. Gruninger, director of the Department of Territories of the Ministry of Interior, told reporters from the United Press today, the United States is a democratic country, and colonies are not what it needs. The U.S. plan is to support the various territories so that they can reach an equal status with the states of the United States. The United States has no intention of expanding colonies and will never oppress the various territories. All regions under the American flag have some degree of autonomy, such as the Philippines, which is an autonomous state, and Hawaii, which is a dependent state. As for when these regions can advance to an equal status with the Federation, this is a question that should be decided by Congress. At the same time, citizens under the American flag should enjoy the rights enjoyed by other citizens. If some regions are temporarily difficult to advance to the same status as "states," then we will also enable the people of these regions to obtain the full rights of American citizens.

### Japanese Overseas Discovery: Mysterious Warship; Strange Japanese News Claims Germany Bribed Soviet Submarines

Tokyo. The regular mail ship "Takasago Maru" arrived in Yokohama last night from Osaka. This morning, the captain reported to the port authorities that he saw a mysterious destroyer of unknown nationality eight miles south of Cape Izu. The news caused a great stir in Yokohama. Soon after, the captain of a certain Japanese cargo ship also stated that he saw a similar warship patrolling twenty miles south of Cape Izu on Sunday afternoon. (Reuters, 20th)

Tokyo. Today, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in response to a reporter's question, stated that the rumor carried by the "Jiji Shinpo" newspaper regarding a Rome dispatch, claiming that Germany and the Soviet Union had concluded a secret agreement allowing German raiding ships to freely use Vladivostok, could not be confirmed at present. As for whether Japanese ships would be attacked by German raiding ships, Japan would seek a solution based on international neutrality if such disputes were to occur in the future. The spokesperson solemnly reiterated Japan's policy of non-intervention in the European war. According to the Rome dispatch mentioned by the spokesperson, published by "Jiji Shinpo", Italy is currently spreading rumors that Germany and the Soviet Union have secretly concluded an agreement, including naval activities in the Far East, and that the German government has agreed to purchase half of the Vladivostok Soviet submarine fleet for use in attacking British and French ships in the Pacific, the China Sea, and the Indian Ocean. It is also rumored that Germany has obtained the right to use this Siberian seaport as a temporary operational base for its Far East submarine fleet, and that German naval personnel have rushed to Vladivostok to take delivery of about twenty submarines. The dispatch further stated that, according to other sources in Rome, two German warships, including the "Deutschland," are currently in the Indian Ocean and may head to Vladivostok to join the submarines and begin attacking Allied ships.

Hygiene

### From Children's Masturbation to Adult and Female Masturbation

— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School

The theory that the bad habit of masturbation originates in childhood has been proven to be true by the diligent research of medical experts. When children first acquire this bad habit, it is mostly unconscious. For example, if their genitals itch, someone else touches them, or it is passed on by others, or they imitate others and engage in actions similar to masturbation, they do not feel any spiritual pleasure. Thereafter, with the increase in age and the development of the nervous system, spiritual pleasure and physiological satisfaction occur unintentionally; thus, they love and engage in conscious masturbation. Similarly, when young people read pornographic books or look at erotic pictures, their erotic feelings are unusually excited, and they involuntarily touch themselves. As a result, they ejaculate. After this strange discovery, they are bound to try a second or third time, and thus repeatedly engage in intentional masturbation. According to this, it can be known that when children first engage in masturbation, whether it is taught by others or self-discovered, it is mostly an impulsive behavior without any spiritual effect, and later becomes a conscious behavior. Therefore, the earlier masturbation occurs in childhood, the greater the harm, because the weak nerves suddenly encounter this powerful stimulation, just like tender young buds encountering the devastation of a storm, and few do not decline and wither.

As for female masturbation, although its harm is not as severe as that of men, prolonged indulgence can cause hypertrophy of the labia and problems with the uterus. Spiritually, it can be said that they completely lose the beauty of virginity. Therefore, most of these women will inevitably become depraved in the future. In short, masturbation, regardless of the period, or male or female, can cause neurasthenia. In men, it can cause kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, pale complexion, weak limbs, tinnitus, headache, and a variety of diseases. Therefore, when children's puberty begins, they should be properly restrained and not allowed to be licentious. If masturbation has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, they should take the German "Biokosmetika" preparation for men, "Körperkraft," which can produce semen, replenish blood, strengthen the brain, and strengthen the kidneys after 24 hours. The ingredients of "Körperkraft" are entirely extracted from the testicles of strong animals, using scientific methods to extract its essence, and mixed with mineral and plant ingredients that are beneficial to the human body. It has the functions of nourishing the brain, nourishing the kidneys, and replenishing blood. Elderly people who take this in winter have the effect of returning to youth. The female "Körperkraft" functions to regulate menstruation and promote fertility, and is a good medicine for gynecology.

### Terrible Colds and Coughs – Lung Disease Expert

— Sheng Zaiqiang

At this time of year, when it is cold, it is easy to catch a cold with the slightest negligence. However, many people regard colds as a minor illness, not worth mentioning, and mostly use ordinary cough medicine as a perfunctory treatment, not knowing that a big mistake has already been made here. When the symptoms become severe, they take apricot kernels and syrup, but the symptoms still do not subside. They are still reluctant to part with these medicines, thus prolonging the time to heal, and ultimately inducing disease. Acute cases become pneumonia, and the disease is critical. If the treatment is not careful, they will lose their lives. Even if they are lucky enough to survive, their bodies become weak and susceptible to tuberculosis, resulting in pulmonary tuberculosis. Even if they do not die, the recuperation takes time, at least three or four years to fully recover, and whether they can avoid recurrence in the future is still unknown. As for cases with severe symptoms, even if they are lucky enough to be cured, it will take at least five to eight years, and the loss of money is even incalculable. It is essential to deal with this in advance.

Furthermore, based on my many years of clinical experience, there are many cases where dangerous lung diseases are induced by colds and coughs, which is very regrettable. Coughing is most likely to shake the lungs. This action makes the lungs uneasy. If a person has a history of tuberculosis, there is a nineteen out of ten chance of developing tuberculosis. There was a Mr. Weng Xinian from Jintan, whose two elder brothers both died of lung disease, at the ages of twenty to thirty. Last fall, he caught a cold while bathing, and coughed frequently. He took cough suppressants, but not only did the cough not stop, but the sputum turned yellow, his voice became hoarse, and he had night sweats. His family feared that he would develop tuberculosis, repeating the fate of his two brothers. He asked me for treatment, and I quickly prescribed the sacred medicine for lung disease, "Pulmotone." After taking it, the cough stopped within three hours, and at the same time, his appetite was greatly stimulated. In less than two weeks, the cough had subsided, and his body was strong, with no signs of illness. Since then, Mr. Weng has regarded "Pulmotone" as a life-saving treasure. From then on, whenever anyone in his family had a cough, they would take "Pulmotone," and all would recover completely. An ideal

### Gonorrhea Treatment

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine, USA

From the new trends in gonorrhea treatment in modern Europe and the United States, European countries, in view of the increasing prevalence of gonorrhea, have launched a general mobilization of the European medical community, organizing anti-gonorrhea groups. According to news from the Science News Service, they have established more than sixty groups in two years, re-examining the failures of past general chemical therapies and transmembrane sterilization therapies, and realizing that these therapies have failed to meet the necessary conditions for killing gonococcus. Finally, the drug "Klimanon," invented by Dr. Peter in Germany, can be described as a completely effective drug for gonorrhea, and the problem of gonorrhea being difficult to treat can also be solved! After taking "Klimanon," the sterilization is extremely powerful, without any adverse reactions. Therefore, for all gonorrhea, regardless of whether it is acute or chronic, the sterilization occurs precisely at the site of the disease, without the shortcomings of being excessive or insufficient. In my decades of experience, among oral medications, "Klimanon" is the most outstanding. Therefore, all major venereal disease hospitals in Europe and the United States regard "Klimanon" as the only ideal and effective drug for conquering gonorrhea.

### Case of Cured Nocturnal Emission

— Dr. Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine, Germany

Treatment of spermatorrhea

Patient Tang Lianqing, from Wuxi, age 23. (Complaint) - In childhood, he was harmed by his companions, often playing with his genitals for pleasure. At the age of seventeen, he had nocturnal emissions. Due to financial difficulties, he did not seek treatment. However, at this time, he had stopped masturbating, but the nocturnal emissions became more frequent day by day, and he suffered from insomnia, forgetfulness, weakened brain, headaches, etc. His memory was greatly reduced and he often felt mentally exhausted. Although he took tonics, they had no effect. Last spring, he was stimulated and visited a prostitute once. A few days later, he suddenly developed gonorrhea, but fortunately he sought treatment quickly and recovered. After that, he developed spermatorrhea. He ejaculated unconsciously at night, and during the day, if he was close to women, semen would leak out naturally. I was very panicked and didn't know what to do. Fortunately, I saw a report and came to seek treatment. (Treatment process) - I ordered him to strictly observe hygiene and prescribed "Nervosan Emission Pills" to stop his emissions and spermatorrhea, and also gave him a large amount of "Körperkraft" to replenish his deficiencies. Mr. Tang followed my advice, and after a week, he had no more emissions. After taking it for two months, he felt much better, slept soundly at night, his mind became clear, and he gained twelve pounds.

Gonorrhea Lecture

### Gonorrhea's Disgusting Symptoms

— Selected by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road

Gonorrhea has a particularly unpleasant impression, which is the discharge in the chronic stage of gonorrhea. However, patients also have a misconception about the discharge, thinking that the discharge has stopped, indicating that their gonorrhea has been completely cured. Little do they know that this view is also unreliable. Because gonorrhea cannot be considered cured simply because the urine becomes clear. Originally, gonococcus is extremely small, and cannot be observed with the naked eye. Generally, after gonorrhea has passed the acute phase, the secretions gradually decrease. But this cannot be regarded as a sign that gonorrhea is gradually healing. In fact, this is a change in gonorrhea, that is, the gonococcus takes advantage of our negligence to lurk deep inside, waiting for an opportunity to move. Whenever the patient moves, or occasionally has sexual intercourse, the urine turns turbid again, and the discharge changes from dripping to floating flocs. In this way, the disease progresses from shallow to deep, causing chronic prostatitis, orchitis, seminal vesiculitis, and cystitis. Patients waste their time and opportunities.

Now, to eliminate this stubborn gonorrhea, it must be thoroughly treated. The policy of eliminating all toxins must be implemented. If we still harbor complacency and treat it as it flares up, or rely on localized surgical treatments that are as confusing as a "maze," we will absolutely not be able to shake the roots of the gonococcus. Because general localized surgical treatments only reach the urethra, and inferior drugs on the market have no curative effect at all. Based on my twenty years of experience, I know that to eliminate discharge and gonococcus, one must use German electrotherapy, WettererX therapy, and anti-gonorrhea serum. Internally, one must take the gonorrhea-specific drug "Klimanon" to fundamentally eliminate the gonococcus in the wide and deep areas. In this way, the disgusting discharge caused by the gonococcus can naturally disappear, and once cured, it will never recur. Clinic hours are from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Starting today, 20 patients will be seen each day. Each number will only receive a "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one yuan.

### Despite His Arduous Journey, the US Ambassador Still Looked Refreshed; Arrived in Shanghai Last Night; After Disembarking, He Took a Speedboat Directly to the Flagship; Visited Huddle for Two Hours; The Ambassador Only Went Ashore at Midnight This Morning

After returning to China to resume his post, US Ambassador to China Johnson went directly to Chongqing to meet with the central authorities, including Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Foreign Minister Wang. After that, he flew to Hong Kong and boarded the President Coolidge on the 18th, arriving in Shanghai at 9 p.m. last night. The ship docked at buoys 11 and 12. The ambassador then transferred to the naval speedboat "USS Isabel" and boarded the US flagship "USS Augusta" to meet with Admiral Huddle for a conversation lasting more than two hours. Details are as follows:

US Consulate Took a Ship to Greet Him

A reporter from this newspaper went to the Customs Wharf at 9 p.m. last night. At that time, US Consul General to Shanghai Gauss and Lockhart were taking a speedboat to the President Coolidge to greet Ambassador Johnson. After Gauss and Lockhart boarded the ship to meet with the ambassador, they accompanied the ambassador on the USS Isabel directly to the USS Augusta in the Huangpu River to meet with Admiral Huddle, Commander-in-Chief of the US Far East Naval Forces.

Accompanied to the Flagship to Visit Huddle

Admiral Huddle personally welcomed him on deck. After shaking hands with the ambassador, they entered the cabin and began their conversation. Only Ambassador Johnson, Admiral Huddle, and Consul General Gauss participated. The content of the conversation is unknown, but it is widely believed that, in addition to exchanging pleasantries, it must have been related to the US strengthening its power in the Far East and recent developments in the Far East. The conversation lasted until midnight.

Went Ashore This Morning and Lodged at the Cathay Hotel

After the important conversation between the ambassador and Admiral Huddle ended, he took the USS Isabel speedboat away from the flagship and went directly to the Customs Wharf. At that time, Chinese police officers sent by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department were on duty at the wharf. The ambassador, accompanied by Consul General Gauss, went ashore in the light rain at 12:10 a.m. this morning, without any attendants. The ambassador was as refreshed as ever and in high spirits, wearing a light-colored coat and holding a cane. His short beard showed a slight white color. He then boarded special car number 4 and went to the Cathay Hotel with Mr. Gauss for a rest.

Consulate Arranged a Special Room

The US Consulate General prepared a special room for the ambassador's use during his stay in Shanghai, which was completed yesterday morning. The ambassador had been staying in Chongqing, the wartime capital of China, for five months after returning to China from Washington. It is not known how long he will stay in Shanghai this time.

Met with the French Ambassador in Hong Kong

On the afternoon of the 16th, the ambassador, accompanied by Deputy Consul Lai Fang, flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong on a China National Aviation Corporation Douglas DC-3 aircraft. He then stayed at a friend's house. It is said that the ambassador met with French Ambassador Cosme at the Guomin Hotel in Causeway Bay on the 17th.

Deeply Sympathetic to China's Resistance Against Japan

Ambassador Johnson arrived in Shanghai on the morning of May 24 this year, with his family, aboard the President Coolidge from San Francisco, USA, and then transferred to Chongqing to resume his post. He stayed in Shanghai for a week, meeting with British Ambassador Kerr and French Ambassador Cosme to reminisce about the past. He then left Shanghai on the Canadian Empress on June 1 and went to Hong Kong and Chongqing to meet with Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, and Foreign Minister Wang to report on his resumption of duty. During his stay in Chongqing, the ambassador expressed great concern about China's resistance against Japan. At a reception hosted by Madame Chiang Kai-shek, he donated 180 yuan in national currency to fund winter clothing for the soldiers at the front. The ambassador stayed in Chongqing for about five months.

No News of Peace Issues

According to the ambassador, during his stay in Chongqing, he had never heard of any peace issues. The ambassador praised the construction of the Burma Road and the Kunming Highway, saying that the completion of the road would be an important route for China to the outside world, and praised it as a modern highway. He himself was very comfortable living in Chongqing and did not feel short of food.

Considers China His Second Home

The ambassador has been in China for nearly 30 years. His first visit to China was when he was nearly 20 years old. According to the ambassador, before returning to China on May 5 this year, he stated on a shortwave radio broadcast near the Golden Gate Exposition on Treasure Island in San Francisco, "I regard China as my second home, a place where my life and spirit are entrusted." And he shouted loudly, "Hey, tell my friends in , that the ambassador used the power of broadcasting to specifically inform Dr. Pike, a key US diplomatic official in China, Goss, the US Consul in Shanghai, and Raukhtut, the US Consul in Beiping. He hoped to use the time to China. The ambassador further stated that he hoped to stay in China forever. He loved China because China was the oldest and most civilized country in the Far East."

### Japanese Ships Are All Painted Black, Fearing the Power of the Chinese Artillery and Air Force

In recent times, the power of the Chinese Air Force has not only been evident on the front lines and at important locations in the Japanese rear, but also poses a serious threat to Japanese warships and merchant ships along the Yangtze River. The sudden and unpredictable Chinese mobile artillery units also strike fear into the hearts of the Japanese warships and merchant ships. It is learned that the Japanese shipping company Fuju has received orders to paint all ships sailing in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River a light black color in an attempt to evade attacks by the Chinese Air Force and mobile artillery units.

### Huddle and Gauss to Depart for the Philippines This Morning, Traveling Together on the Flagship Augusta; The Nature of the Philippines Conference is Extremely Important

US Consul General to Shanghai Gauss will take advantage of his vacation to meet with US High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre. Because US Ambassador to China Johnson arrived in Shanghai last night, Mr. Gauss reported everything, and after thinking about it, he would meet with Admiral Huddle after the meeting with US Ambassador to China Johnson last night, and then depart for the Philippines with Admiral Huddle on the flagship Augusta this morning.

Discussing the Maintenance of Far East Interests

A meeting is scheduled to be held this week in Baguio, Philippines, to discuss the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, which the US government insists on, to protect American interests in the Far East, and to decide on future policies. In addition to participating in Sayre and Gauss, the location of Baguio in the southern part of the island and the composition of the Asian Fleet will be thoroughly inspected and studied.

Commissioner Sayre to Come to Shanghai Next Spring

Huddle will stay in the Philippines for a long period of time and will not come north for a while. Commissioner Sayre, after meeting with Gauss and Admiral Huddle, will tour the southern countries before the end of this year, and may come to Shanghai next spring to meet with Ambassador Johnson to discuss everything. If time permits, he plans to visit Ambassador Grew in Japan.

Philippine Defense Greatly Strengthened

The US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation will expire on January 26, and the US will implement economic action, so Far East defense will become tighter. Therefore, the defense of the Philippines, which controls the Pacific entrance, has been greatly strengthened. In addition to 14 naval bombers and 7 submarines sailing to the Philippines to join the defense, new ships will continue to be sent to the Philippines. The US government has decided to entrust Admiral Huddle with the responsibility for commanding everything in the Far East defense. The upcoming Philippines conference, concerning US interests in the Far East, deserves special attention.

Gauss's Vacation Lasts Six Weeks

Consul General Gauss will meet with his wife and eldest son Charles, who are returning from the US to the Far East. The date of his return to Shanghai will be next spring. The duties of the consulate in Shanghai will be assumed by Lockhart of the US Embassy in Beiping. Mr. Lockhart arrived here from Beiping on the 10th. In addition, the Municipal Council recently received a notice stating that the US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, had been approved to take a six-week vacation starting on the 18th of this month. During all vacation periods, the affairs of the consulate will be temporarily handled by Lockhart (Fraut P. Locklart), Counselor and Consul General of the Embassy.

Western Newspapers Describe the Nature of the Meeting

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated, "It was learned this morning (the 20th) that the US destroyer Augusta is scheduled to leave Shanghai early tomorrow morning (the 21st). US Consul General Gauss will take the opportunity to travel to Manila as a guest of Admiral Huddle, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet. On the surface, Gauss is going to Manila to meet his wife and son, who are flying across the Pacific from the United States on the Clipper flying boat.

The Plane Departs

It will arrive in the Philippines in a few days. However, it is said that Gauss will stay in the Philippines until the end of this year, during which time he will hold several meetings with US Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre and Admiral Huddle. Admiral Huddle will also be stationed in Philippine waters until next spring. Reporters expect that the three US officials will hold

The Nature of the Meeting

When asked about this at the local consulate, they did not give a definite answer. However, reliable sources say that, given the recent movements of British troops in China, the discussion among the three officials may center on the US's military strategy in the Far East, both naval and land forces. It is also generally believed that the three officials will also

Conduct Research

Gauss will meet with US Ambassador to China Johnson, who arrived in Shanghai tonight, before leaving Shanghai tomorrow morning. Gauss will also report the details of the recent discussions held with Japanese envoy Kato to US Ambassador and Sayre. Gauss will be away from Shanghai until early next year. During his absence, Lockhart, Counselor of the US Embassy in Beiping, will be in charge of the affairs of the US Consulate in this city."

### Faced with Public Criticism, the Japanese Release a Batch of Eggs; Eggs Shipped to Shanghai Still Need to Be Inspected; Very Few Are Allowed to Enter the Concession

After the Japanese government controlled the egg trade, it initially decided not to allow the free transport of eggs into the Concession for sale. However, recently, due to the overwhelming public criticism, in order to cover up public opinion, it agreed to allow some eggs to be transported into the Concession, but the number was very small. Eggs transported to Shanghai from the suburbs must be gathered at the so-called "New Huishan Wharf" in Pudong (near the Yangtze Wharf), and after Japanese personnel are sent to inspect them by small motorboat, they are allowed to be transported into the Concession if they are deemed acceptable. Otherwise, the eggs are forcibly loaded onto the motorboat and transported to the "Livestock Market" where they are bought at a reduced price. Yesterday, 100 from Tianshenggang, about 80,000 eggs, were brought by Nantong Maru, purchased by the British firm Moo Chong. When it docked at the Yangtze Wharf, it was inspected by Japanese personnel. Because it was owned by a British firm, it was allowed to be released and transported in.

### The Western Police Chief Detained by the Japanese Army Has Been Released; However, Two Chinese Police Officers Are Still Detained and Not Released; The Pseudo-Police of the Western District Are Very Arrogant

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated that yesterday (the 19th), Japanese military police arrested Western Police Chief Aygerburg and two Chinese police officers, and a female inspector, on a road in the Public Concession within the Italian military defense zone. After a strong protest from the Italian Marines, Western Police Chief Ayer and the female inspector were released last night, but the two Chinese police officers are still being held in detention by the Japanese military police today (the 20th). It is not clear why. Officer Ayger led a search party on Rue Robert生 to carry out

Routine Duties

At that time, he attempted to search a suspicious man. The man shouted to a street police officer standing on the road in the Concession. The officer fired a shot aimlessly. The search party heard the sound and drew their guns, loaded with live ammunition. A shot was accidentally fired. The search party then chased the suspicious man along the road when the Japanese military police arrived on the scene and

Arrested Everyone

Later, after protests from the Italian Marines and Danish Consul General Hill, Western Police Chief Ayger was released after being held for five hours, and the female inspector was released at the same time, but the two Chinese police officers are still being detained by the Japanese at No. 94 Jessfield Road. The reason is unknown. In recent days, street police have used

Rifles to Shoot

This is the second time that street police have fired rifles on the roads of the Concession in the rogue territory. The first time was at the intersection of Thibet Road and Avenue Road, when a street police officer who usurped the police authority of the Police Department fired a shot at a British expatriate driving a car. It is said that it was because the British expatriate did not obey the "traffic signals" issued by the police officer.

French Army Officer Shot

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated that French Army Corporal Mandolini was shot in the leg by a Chinese man at the corner of Hongqiao Road and Columbia Road just after midnight yesterday. At the time, Corporal Mann was off duty and on his way back to the barracks. It is widely believed that he had an argument with the Chinese man at the scene, which led to the shooting.

### Statistics on Japanese Aircraft Raids on Zhejiang in the Last Four Months: An Average of Six Bombs Injure One Person, Nine Bombs Kill One Person

According to intelligence statistics from various agencies in Zhejiang Province, as compiled by the Zhejiang Provincial Political Work Guidance Office, there were a total of 175 Japanese air raids in the province in the four months from July to October of this year, with 578 bombs dropped, destroying 1,345 houses, injuring 99 people, and killing 63 people. On average, each bomb destroyed two houses, six bombs injured one person, and nine bombs killed one person. Among these, the bombing of Lishui, Linhai, and Qingtian counties in August was the most devastating. However, those harmed and killed were all innocent civilians with little to no military value. As the Japanese are aware of their weak bombing capabilities, they have recently intensified their efforts, even deploying air-burst bombs with the aim of killing civilians dispersed in open areas outside the city. These types of bombs have been discovered in various locations, and their effectiveness in harming the population is greater. The Zhejiang Provincial Government, recognizing the large population of the province and fearing that existing air raid shelters will be insufficient, has reportedly instructed the Air Defense Headquarters to expedite the construction of more air raid shelters in proportion to the population to minimize unnecessary sacrifices.

### A Japanese National Shot Dead in the Japanese Defense Zone of Hongkou; The Deceased Was in the Silk Business, Shot in the Head; Japanese Troops Immediately Imposed Alert and Conducted Thorough Search

The China Press reports that Asahi Atsukokujiro, a 30-year-old Japanese national from Osaka who operated a silk cocoon business in Shanghai and resided at 21 Tangshan Road in the Japanese military defense zone of Yangshupu, was shot and killed while riding a rickshaw near his residence in the dusky evening of yesterday (the 19th). A bullet entered through his cheek and penetrated his head, causing immediate death. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces immediately established a cordon in the Tangshan Road area and searched Chinese entering and leaving Hongkou and Yangshupu. Foreign nationals were not affected. The Japanese Consulate Police Department and the Shanghai Municipal Police are jointly investigating the case. Due to the late hour, there were no eyewitnesses near the scene, so the details could not be ascertained. It is reported that the shooter was a man in Chinese clothing.

### The Puppet Government Postponed Indefinitely

Dazhong News Agency reports that the long-publicized puppet government has yet to reach a consensus, so its establishment is indefinitely postponed. This is because there are clear differences of opinion between the two sides on the three major issues of economic cooperation, the withdrawal of Japanese troops, and the organization of a "new central army." The disagreement of opinions is evident here.

### Five Chinese Beaten Ferociously by Japanese Soldiers in Xingang; Sent to Renji Hospital for Treatment After Arriving in Shanghai

The Neihe steamship Guohua, operated by a Japanese company, arrived at the wharf yesterday morning with five Chinese passengers who had been severely injured. They were taken to Renji Hospital by an ambulance from the Shanghai Municipal Council. It is reported that the injuries of the five men were extremely severe, with some having broken leg bones. According to them, they recently boarded the ship from Xingang to Shanghai. Before departure, fearing that they would not have enough food en route, they bought a small amount of flour on the shore to stave off hunger. Unexpectedly, this was seen by the Japanese soldiers stationed there, who suspected them of transporting food for export. Without explanation, they were beaten with gun butts and wooden sticks. Although they quickly discarded the flour, they had already suffered bloodshed and fractures.

### The Authorities Are Determined to Subdue Those Manipulating Rice Prices; Speculators Attempting to Form a Group; Strict Punishment Will Be Imposed Upon Confirmation; Hoarders Weaving Their Own Doom, Rice Prices Fell Yesterday

The recent food issue in Shanghai, with the unreasonable surge in rice prices, is about to trigger a severe situation like that a month ago. However, this time, the turmoil is clearly due to someone speculating and manipulating the market again, which should be thoroughly investigated and punished. The reporter from Dazhong News Agency has learned the following information:

Various Parties Proceeding to Stop Manipulation

At this time of new grain harvest and abundant autumn harvest, all sectors of this city, aware of the severity of the food issue in Shanghai two months ago, the Shanghai Municipal Council and various powerful groups are planning to set up grain storage groups and operate rice businesses as a precautionary measure to prevent panic next spring. Unexpectedly, in the past three or four days, the peak of japonica rice has suddenly risen to the 40 yuan mark. The reason for this is definitely not due to blocked sources or meager reserves. The rice sources in the suburbs are continuously being imported into the concession, and according to the Shanghai Municipal Council's investigation, the current rice reserves in Shanghai are similar to when rice prices were stable, and the amount is immeasurably different from the amount when rice prices rose in September. Therefore, it is obvious that this increase is being manipulated by speculators behind the scenes in order to make huge profits. In order to prevent food panic and maintain social order, it is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council is now thoroughly investigating the truth behind the increase. Once the facts are verified, it will proceed to impose strict punishment. In addition to the City Federation presenting a close watch to the concession authorities, powerful groups such as the silver and money industries and various factory industries have recently jointly requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Rice Industry Association to take effective measures to stop speculation and manipulation and stabilize people's hearts. The pressure of social justice should somewhat reduce the insatiable desires of unscrupulous merchants.

Fundraising for Manipulation, Under Investigation

Moreover, according to the Dazhong News Agency reporter's inquiry to two rice industry giants, the continuous rise in rice prices is due to someone speculating and profiting from it, and there is no other reason to explain it. To say that it is due to blocked sources, insufficient reserves, or the Japanese rice panic is all a confusion of black and white. At least seven or eight thousand bags of rice arrive in Shanghai every day, and Shanghai only needs 7,000 bags of rice per day, and the reserves are very sufficient. As for the Japanese absorbing grain from the inland, most of them purchase Wuhu indica rice (i.e., indica rice from the Wuhu area). Those transported from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway area to Shanghai are all japonica rice, so they are not affected by it. Why is japonica rice rising so much? The reason is not difficult to understand. When the reporter asked whether there was any truth to the rumors that speculators were raising funds to form a company in order to manipulate the rice market on a large scale, the answer was that they did not know the details. However, the rice industry groups have been conducting thorough investigations and discussing countermeasures in recent days in order to eradicate future hidden dangers.

Hoarders' Plans Fail, Rice Prices Fall

After the soaring rice prices, due to the obvious manipulation by unscrupulous merchants behind the scenes, public opinion was rife with complaints, and the Rice Market Management Committee also resolved the day before yesterday to rectify brokers arbitrarily raising prices in the market, forcing the generally treacherous elements to restrain themselves slightly. Yesterday, the arrival of rice in the rice market by land and water totaled more than 7,000 bags. The amount of rice registered by cargo owners with the Rice Market Management Committee for consignment increased by more than 400 bags compared to the previous day, to 1,900 bags. The situation in the rice market after the opening was more stable than yesterday. As a result, due to smooth sources, prices fell, with various japonica rice varieties falling by about two yuan per picul. Indica rice varieties also fell by one yuan and two or three jiao. It is predicted that hoarders will have to sell urgently because they cannot maintain the original price, and rice prices will fall further.

Japanese Side Inquires About Two Rice Stores

The Xiechangde Rice Store at 206 Avenue Road, Shanghai, had 125 bags of rice consigned by a Wuxi merchant through the Yongxing Transportation Company to the store for retail sales. Unexpectedly, the day after the rice was transported to Shanghai, three Japanese personnel went to the store to investigate the transportation passport, claiming that the passport was forged, and prohibiting its sale. They planned to take the rice away completely. The store argued that the passport issue was the responsibility of the Yongxing Transportation Company and had nothing to do with the consignee. It immediately rejected the Japanese side's request and notified the police. Upon receiving the news, the police immediately sent three Chinese officers to protect the store. Upon hearing the news, the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai also sent troops to assist in the protection, as the area was part of the U.S. military defense zone. As the police have not yet clarified the facts of the case, the store has been ordered to temporarily stop withdrawing the 75 bags of rice stored in the Shanghai Bank warehouse, and the store has been instructed that if there are any further disputes due to this matter in the future, they can notify the police at any time. A similar situation occurred at the Yuanmao Rice Store at 13, Lane 344, Baker Road, which was also given protection by the U.S. military and the police.

### Ballin Released, Japanese Side Has Notified the U.S. Consul; No News on Whether the Chinese Have Been Released

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that the Panama-flagged freighter Bolivar, managed by Wah Lun Company, has been released this morning (the 20th) after being detained by the Japanese Special Service Department for nearly three weeks. The Japanese authorities have verbally notified the U.S. Consul, the representative of the Panamanian government in Shanghai, about the release of the ship. However, no news has been issued as to whether a Chinese, the second officer of the ship, who was detained shortly after the Bolivar was seized, has been released.

### Relief Carnival, Announcement to All Sectors, Hoping for Enthusiastic Participation

The Shanghai Chicken People Relief Association, Citizens Group Solicitation Committee, issued an announcement to all sectors for raising funds for refugee cotton clothing, stating that as winter approaches and the weather gets colder day by day, the refugees in the shelters and on the streets still do not have cotton clothing for the winter, especially those poor children who are so cold that their faces are colorless, which is really very pitiful. In order to help them, the association has scheduled to hold a carnival at the Gengxin Stage on Niuzhuang Road from the 27th to the 30th of this month. The program includes a grand show with famous amateurs, famous actors, movie stars, Shanghai opera, comedy, storytelling, Kunqu opera, and drama, which is extremely exciting and intense. Tickets are divided into three types: Honorary Tickets (10 yuan), Fortune Fruit Tickets (5 yuan), and Philanthropic Tickets (2 yuan). Sales have already begun. All ticket proceeds will be used for refugee cotton clothing expenses. It is hoped that all sectors will participate enthusiastically. It is truly immeasurable merit to both feast the eyes and help the refugees. Ticket sales locations: (1) Room 414, Xingye Building, Jiangxi Road and Beijing Road, the association's office. To purchase tickets by phone, please dial 18533, and we will send someone to deliver them. (2) Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, and Dah Sun department stores on Nanjing Road. (3) Zhongfa Pharmacy on Nicheng Bridge. (4) Bank of China, Jiusi Huizhong Branch on Henan Road and Beijing Road.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Prints and Distributes Factory Registration Forms

Factory registration matters in this city were previously managed by the Social Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government. After the Social Affairs Bureau temporarily ceased to exercise its functions, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently stipulated that all factory registrations can be directly applied for with the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing, still in accordance with the original method, by filling out Forms A and B. It is learned that the two forms have now been printed and distributed by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Form A should include: (1) Factory name and address; (2) Factory manager; (3) Chief technician; (4) Company or business capital; (5) Factory organization; (6) Registration license number; (7) Date of commencement of operations; (8) Products and raw materials; (9) Motive power; (10) Machinery and important tools; (11) Factory address and building; (12) Product sales area and sales volume; (13) Manufacturing process description; (14) Cost accounting; (15) Whether there are branch factories. Form B should include: (1) Number of staff; (2) Number of workers; (3) Highest and lowest wages; (4) Working hours; (5) Whether there is a labor contract; (6) Worker reward and punishment methods; (7) Types of worker welfare programs; (8) Factory safety and health facilities, etc.

### The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Society Distributes Relief in Various Counties in Anhui and Jiangsu

The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Society remitted funds to Tianjin, and recently entrusted churches in 21 counties including Jing County and Shen County to organize branch associations for relief distribution. Funds have also been remitted to Anhui Province, such as Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, Bo County, Fuyang, Shou County, Huaiyuan, and Huaian in northern Jiangsu, for relief. It is learned that the Society's Secretary-General Ou Yongkang is raising funds in Hong Kong and will return to Shanghai soon. If various sectors in this city can also provide a steady stream of donations, a large-scale relief distribution plan will still need to be planned.

### Shanghai-Zhejiang Sailing Vessels Transporting Goods for Export Can Reduce the Balance of Guarantee Deposits or Add Credit Guarantees

The Chongqing Trade Commission, according to the request of the Haimen settlement agent Dong, that coastal sailing vessels from the port are transporting goods for export without documents that can be ordered to be submitted to the bank. If the settlement amount is handed over locally, the Haimen Bank of China cannot settle the account due to the fluctuating black market price, and the foreign exchange settled under the newly promulgated settlement method must be registered, certified, and paid in Hong Kong, which is difficult to hand over in the interior. If merchants are required to pay a security deposit, it would cost two or three times as much and be difficult to bear. Moreover, this type of sailing vessel sails to Shanghai rather than Hong Kong, and the seaports of Wenzhou and Fuzhou also have this situation. In addition to temporarily requiring merchants to pay a security deposit, it is requested to instruct what to do to be appropriate. After receiving the report, the Commission believes that under this settlement method, it is possible to negotiate with the bank to reduce the security deposit amount according to the actual situation or add a credit guarantee to prevent emergencies, and immediately instructed the branch to comply.

### Fire at Shanghai River Primary School, One Student Fell and Was Injured

At about 1:21 PM yesterday, a fire broke out upstairs at the Shanghai River Primary School at 19, Nanyang Lane, North Zhejiang Road, because incense sticks lit upstairs fell onto the window awning. At that time, there were a total of more than 400 students in the school, and when they suddenly heard the fire alarm while classes were in session in the classrooms, the students fled in panic. A male student, Qin Meiyou, aged eleven, jumped from the window upstairs, fracturing his left foot. He was subsequently taken to the Tibetan Road Refugee Hospital by the Fire Brigade ambulance. The fire was extinguished quickly due to the large number of people, and fortunately did not burn down the buildings, only scorching the doors and windows, and the loss was still small.

### Legal Tender Circulation in Shanghai Will Definitely Not Be Lacking, Foreign Banks Providing Assistance at Any Time, Large Quantities of Small Denomination Notes Will Soon Be Shipped to Shanghai, Speculators Make Trouble and Profit, Harming Public Security

After Li Jiannan, the puppet "Jianghai Customs Superintendent," attempted to obstruct the import of Chinese legal tender, various foreign banks firmly opposed and ignored it. For the needs of legitimate trade, they are shipping legal tender from Hong Kong to Shanghai for assistance. The four banks, namely the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, have already temporarily stopped shipping legal tender to Shanghai due to their forced environment. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the circulation of legal tender in Shanghai is sufficient to meet the needs of the market. All industries unanimously refuse to use "Huaxing notes." Foreign banks often ship legal tender to Shanghai, so there will definitely not be a lack of legal tender in Shanghai, causing panic. Regarding subsidiary coins and small denomination notes, which are issued by the Central Bank of China and other banks, those circulating on the market include the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, and the Zhejiang Local Bank, etc., in large numbers. Recently, the Central Bank of China has temporarily suspended issuance because the existing notes have been issued. This has led to speculators making trouble and profiting in the market. It is learned that foreign banks have reached an agreement with the Central Bank's head office and will ship large quantities of subsidiary coins to Shanghai, so there will be no problem with subsidiary coins. It is also learned that the first batch of 500,000 yuan in fractional currency notes has been issued, and the second batch is being rushed to print by the American company Yongning, and will be officially announced and issued as soon as it is delivered to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank.

### Chen Zhanxiong's Bribery Case in Prison: Obvious Criminal Circumstances; Prosecutor's Arguments Stated; Yu Qiaqing and Others Attended Yesterday; Court Orders Conclusion of Trial Pending Judgment; Bail Denied

Chen Zhanxiong, a native of Fenghua, age 44, residing at Lane 1316, No. 14, Xin Zha Road, owner of the Anle Palace Hotel dance hall and manager of the Ivanhoe Club on Yuyuan Road, Hongqiao, was arrested by the French police on the night of the second day of last month for smoking opium in the Anle Palace. The next day, he was transferred to the Special No. 2 Court and prosecuted according to law, sentenced to six months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day. He was first sent to the detention center, with a deadline of one month to:

Quit Opium Addiction

This led to prisoners Qin Jiaqi, Tao Yongchang, Chen Jusheng, and others colluding with guards Jiang Ding, Tu Gang, Luo Zhiyi, and others to extort one hundred and fifty yuan, which they divided among themselves. They also provided Chen Zhanxiong with cigarettes, tea, and other items. This was discovered by the head guard of the detention center, who found evidence and sent all the above-mentioned individuals to the Prosecutor's Office of the Special No. 1 Court for investigation and prosecution. In the meantime, the two guards, Jiang Ding and Tu Gang, feeling guilty and fearing punishment, escaped. After the prosecutor concluded the investigation, because Chen Zhanxiong had completed his detoxification, he was released on a 3,000-yuan bail bond, to be available for questioning. The prosecutor's office then filed a public lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the same court on charges of:

Dereliction of Duty and Bribery

At the same time, Shen Tianhe and Lu Daming, the guarantors of the two guards Jiang and Tu, were strictly ordered to find and hand over Jiang and Tu to be investigated and prosecuted. When the case was heard by Judge Zhang Minsheng of the Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court on the afternoon of the sixth of this month, Chen Zhanxiong claimed illness and appointed lawyer Jiang Pingfan to appear in court. After a brief interrogation of the other defendants, the hearing was adjourned due to the absence of all the accused. Chen Zhanxiong presented a doctor's certificate claiming illness, but it was found that Chen was not being treated in a hospital, and police sent to apprehend him were unsuccessful. Due to Chen's:

Escape Attempt

His guarantor, Xia Dajin, was arrested on suspicion of concealing a criminal and facilitating his escape and transferred to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation and handling. At this point, Chen Zhanxiong, unwilling to implicate his guarantor, surrendered to the Prosecutor's Office on the afternoon of the eighth, reported in, and was detained, and transferred to the Criminal Court. Meanwhile, the Prosecutor's Office found no evidence that Chen's guarantor had concealed or assisted in his escape and ordered his release. All these details have been reported in this newspaper. The Criminal Court scheduled a public hearing for 2:00 PM yesterday. Because this case had attracted public attention, yesterday,

Prominent Figures in Shanghai

Including Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and over ten others, all fellow villagers of Chen Zhanxiong, as well as Chen's relatives and friends, all attended the court hearing. The gallery of the Second Criminal Court was packed, leaving almost no room to stand. In addition to lawyer Jiang Pingfan, Chen Zhanxiong also appointed lawyer Jiang Yiping to participate in the defense. The other two defendants, Zhou Zhiyi and Tao Yongchang, also appointed lawyers Ge Zhijun and Zhou Lianze for their defense. At the third stroke of the clock, Judge Zhang Minsheng, together with the prosecutor, arrived at the Second Criminal Court for the hearing. According to:

Chen Zhanxiong's Testimony

Because of the opium case, I was arrested on the second day of last month and sent to the detention center to detoxify after being interrogated by the court on the third day. I was detained in cell number six. On the fourth day, I asked Tao Yongchang, a prisoner assigned to do errands, for hot water. Tao replied, "This is a prison, not a hotel." Then prisoner Qin Jiaqi said to me, "To win a lawsuit, you have to treat people." Because I couldn't understand his Shandong dialect clearly, I asked Chen Jusheng, a prisoner in the same cell, to translate. Later, it was agreed upon that the amount would be 150 yuan. On the fifth and ninth days, I wrote notes to the guard surnamed Jiang, asking him to send someone to the Anle Palace to get the money. But they took the money, didn't give it to me, and I didn't see it, so I don't know

How it was Divided

Later, Qin Jiaqi gave me cigarettes, tea, and food. The amount of 150 yuan was discussed between the guard surnamed Jiang and Qin, etc. When Zhou, Qin, Tao, and Chen Jusheng were questioned, they all denied asking Chen Zhanxiong for money and blamed it all on the two guards, Jiang and Tu, who were at large. The guarantors of Jiang and Tu, Shen Tianhe and his master Shen Cangyuan, and Lu Daming, all stated that they did not know the individuals personally and that friends had introduced them to act as guarantors. They really didn't know where they had escaped. At this point, the court, considering the case clear, ordered arguments to be made. The prosecutor's opinion was as follows: "The defendants all

Admitted Unreservedly

During the investigation and in court, but now they are recanting. However, the circumstances of the crime are obvious and should be punished according to the crime of bribery and dereliction of duty." After the defendants' lawyers made their defenses one by one, the court ordered the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:00 PM on the twenty-seventh. The defendants were returned to custody. Chen Zhanxiong's lawyers, Jiang and Jiang, earnestly requested the court to grant bail, but the judge stated that the defendant's crime was serious and denied bail.

### Manager of a Foreign Cloth Store on Haig Road Arrested: Connected to an Extortion Case

Yesterday morning at around 7:00 AM, detectives Shen Jinshu, Dai Rongji, Jiang Zhongjia, and others from the Criminal Division of the French Concession Police Station rushed to a certain foreign cloth store at No. 1225 Haig Road, Hongqiao, and arrested the store's local manager, Qu, taking him back to the police station for detention. The case originated on the afternoon of September 20th of this year at around 7:00 PM, when Shen Chengyu, a local resident and owner of a leather glove factory at No. 10 Renhe Lane, Hongqiao Road, was passing by the entrance of Xiaoyou Lane on Avenue Petain when several local ruffians, including Qin Haixiang and Shen Huixing, blocked Shen and threatened him with handguns and other weapons to extort 3,000 yuan. Shen was outnumbered and pleaded that he didn't have the money with him. Qin and the others then gave Shen a week to reply. Subsequently, Qu's seventh younger brother stepped forward to mediate, and the two parties negotiated at the Samsung Teahouse on Rue Remy on the 26th of the same month, agreeing on 800 yuan as "longevity money," with 300 yuan to be paid first. A person named Wu Tianming was also present. On the afternoon of the 18th at around 5:00 PM, the two parties agreed to pay the remaining amount at the Yile Teahouse in Xujiahui, but Shen, unwilling to comply, secretly reported to the French police beforehand, who dispatched disguised detectives to the scene and arrested Qin Haixiang and Shen Huixing (nicknamed "Little Iron Plate") on the spot. After interrogating them at the police station, they confessed that Qu had mediated the matter. The police, believing that Qu was involved in the extortion case, secretly went to arrest him yesterday morning.

Because neither party could brake in time, they collided with each other. The car was completely wrecked and unable to move. The Westerner driving the car was also seriously injured. Chinese police arrived to record the tram driver's number and sent the Westerner to the hospital for treatment. The traffic was blocked for about half an hour.

### Letter

November 20th, The news item "Drunkard Creates Trouble in Hotel" in your newspaper's news column on the 20th of this month is inconsistent with the facts. It is not true that I and Inspector Wang of the Far East Hotel were drinking that evening and quarreled over a hostess. The dispute was caused by the rude and insulting remarks made by the hotel owner, Yan Yongxiao, towards his patrons, which led to an argument. The hotel owner then called the police, and Chinese police officer No. 3048 arrived. After investigating the truth, it was confirmed that the hotel owner had insulted the customer, and the Chinese police officer was present, Yan was still very arrogant. All the facts are there, how can one smear someone's reputation? The hotel owner later realized that he was wrong and asked the Chinese police officer to leave. We are all honest businessmen and do not want to argue with the hotel owner. However, since it concerns the reputation of myself and Inspector Wang of the Far East Hotel, and since it is inconsistent with the facts, I hereby request your newspaper to correct it to avoid rumors and misunderstandings. Sincerely, Zhang Jiale, November 20th

### Finance: Tianjin Banks Buy Heavily; Gold Market Flourishes Again

Yesterday's spot gold secret market situation, inheriting the improved and potentially solid momentum of the previous weekend, the situation entered a favorable state early on. Because the Tianjin exchange rate market was tight, the gold price in that area rose, so Tianjin banks put a lot of effort into covering short positions in this city. At the same time, this caused local retail investors to follow suit and search for positions, and there was no shortage of positive rumors among them. Although the buying trend was strong, the securities companies continued to push out a considerable amount in the afternoon session, so the final closing result was only more than forty yuan higher. Early in the morning, the exchange rate market was softening, and a certain money exchange and a certain securities company took the lead in releasing their positions, and the price rose to 3,660 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain gold shop suddenly poured out more than two hundred taels, and the rising momentum was immediately frustrated, immediately returning fifteen yuan. At that time, the sellers also stopped selling, but the foreign exchange was still firm and did not release, and a certain money exchange and a certain securities company absorbed each other, causing the price to rise again to 3,660 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange returned to parity, and money exchanges and gold shops came out to release, and for a time there were few takers, so it had fallen to a low of 3,640 yuan. Until before the closing in the afternoon, the exchange rate market was stable, and a certain gold shop pulled up on behalf of Hong Kong banks, and the closing price rose again to 3,657 yuan. In the afternoon, people's hearts became more excited. A certain money exchange continued to scoop up more than 300 taels, although a certain securities company also vigorously sold as many as 500 taels, but retail investors were bullish and followed suit, and the market was firm. The highest price was once 3,680 yuan, and the final closing price was still 3,677 yuan, which was 47 yuan higher than the closing price on the previous weekend. The entire day's transactions were brisk, with approximately 2,800 taels traded. Gold jewelry in gold shops was marked up by five yuan, while customs gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Rose 47 Yuan

From the beginning of the morning, each tael (ten taels) carried the remaining prestige of the previous Saturday afternoon, and the exchange rate market opened slightly soft, and then a certain money exchange and a securities company mutually released and bought, causing the market to open high at 3,660 yuan. Then the money exchanges did thirty taels of mutual business. Unexpectedly, at this time, a certain gold shop suddenly poured out more than two hundred taels on behalf of a customer, the trend was frustrated, and it immediately fell back fifteen yuan. A certain gold shop sold twenty taels to a gold number for 3,645 yuan. After that, the exchange rate market continued to soften, and a certain gold shop had stopped selling and was watching, so it rose again. A securities company bought forty taels from a gold shop for 3,660 yuan. Subsequently, because the foreign exchange suddenly turned hard, gold shops and money exchanges took the opportunity to compete to sell, and soon they fell back a little twenty yuan. A gold shop sold twenty taels to a money exchange for 3,640 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange came to absorb a hundred taels, so it raised the price by ten yuan. A certain money exchange bought thirty taels from a securities company for 3,650 yuan. Later, a certain gold number and another money exchange came to sell, and the price was pushed down to 3,640 yuan. Near noon, a certain money exchange revived the buying trend, and the certain gold shop that had dumped in the early morning suddenly bought on behalf of a Hong Kong bank, and the exchange rate market had stopped loosening and turned flat, rising again. Before long, it rose seventeen yuan. A money exchange bought thirty taels from a securities company, for 3,657 yuan as the closing price at noon. It was heard that a certain gold shop still had strong buying intentions after the closing, and the price was raised to 3,660 yuan. In the afternoon, a securities company sold thirty taels to a gold shop, still for 3,660 yuan. Later, because a certain money exchange revitalized the remaining power and vigorously bought more than two hundred taels, and the foreign exchange was stable and slightly soft, the price was raised by twelve yuan. A certain money exchange bought thirty taels from a gold number for 3,672 yuan. At that time, a securities company vigorously sold more than three hundred taels, so it fell back a little seven yuan. A securities company sold twenty taels to a gold shop for 3,665 yuan. Afterwards, the selling intention of the securities company was slightly weaker, and a certain money exchange and retail investors had some appetite, so the price rose again by fifteen yuan. A money exchange bought twenty taels from a gold number for 3,680 yuan. Near the closing, the market was slightly weak. A securities company sold twenty taels to a money exchange for 3,677 yuan. As a result, it rose forty-seven yuan compared to the previous Saturday's closing price, with a fluctuation of forty yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold numbers was ten yuan higher than the spot gold, and the buying price was reduced by more than twenty yuan. The current bid price for gold is five to sixty yuan lower than the listed price.

Gold Jewelry Marked Up by Five Yuan

The exchange price of gold jewelry per tael was initially still 370 yuan at the Dahang company. The gold jewelry at Dahang company raised the price by five yuan at 3:50 PM. As a result, Dahang company changed its listing to 375 yuan, which was the same as the previous price. The buying price was reduced by 15 to 20 yuan.

### Japanese Merchants Settle Slightly; Forward Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC listing, the announcement was still flat. Although the British and American exchange secret market was at the beginning of the week, there were still no major changes. This was because the atmosphere in the market has been silent recently, and buying and selling have been slow. Yesterday's process hovered from beginning to end. At the beginning, Hong Kong Telegraph put out its positions first, while HSBC vigorously absorbed. Then, a certain American bank bought British gold, and at the same time, general Chinese merchants' buying intentions revived, so at this moment it was tight and soft. It was once tight to five pennies, two eight one two five and eight yuan five six two five. Soon the buyers were satisfied, and the American bank resold American exchange, and even Hong Kong Telegraph re-released its positions, so it returned to parity. Extended to the afternoon closing, the appearance was slightly soft, with British gold at five pennies three one two five and American exchange at eight yuan six two five. In the afternoon, the situation was often in a stable state, and Japanese merchant banks and speculators slightly bought forward contracts. Tobacco importers settled, but this was not affected, and transactions were also rare. As a result, British gold still closed at five pennies three one two five, and American exchange slightly softened to eight yuan five nine three seven five, compared to the previous weekend, British was tight at zero three one two five and American was soft at zero six two five. The trend of futures opening was the same as that of spot.

Hong Kong Telegraph and a certain bank sold spot British gold to Datong Youli and other foreign firms for five pennies three one two five and three four three seven five, and spot American exchange for eight yuan six two five and six five six two five.

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Initially Strong, Then Retraced; Domestic Bonds Hovered Between 15 and 15.5 Cents

The off-exchange securities market continued its weak and lifeless state yesterday. Investor sentiment remained uncertain, making a rebound difficult in the short term. At the opening of trading yesterday morning, both bulls and bears remained largely on the sidelines. Most of the trading on the exchange floor consisted of scalping activities, seeking minor profits. Market prices fluctuated between 5 and 10 cents, showing a slight decline compared to Saturday. Afternoon trading was quiet, with most issues remaining unchanged, and a few rising or falling within a 5 to 10 cent range. The resulting atmosphere of inactivity led to a daily decrease in the number of attendees. Most stock prices ended the day down by a cent or two, with only Ding-type stocks performing well, up by four cents, due to not having traded on Saturday afternoon. The total trading volume was approximately 500,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below:

Stock Transactions: 30 shares of Guohuo Bank stock were traded at a price of 45 yuan each.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's stock market opened in the afternoon yesterday with extreme activity. Amid a surge, various stocks that had been attracting public attention experienced new price levels. After a period of lull, Jardine Matheson shares soared to 68.5 yuan, a substantial increase of more than 3 yuan from the previous weekend's closing price. Steel industry shares also rose to a high of 15.1 yuan. Subsequently, many stocks experienced a considerable retracement as investors took profits, highlighting the underlying potential of the market and the unpredictable nature of its fluctuations.

### Cotton Yarn and Raw Cotton: Indian Cotton Soars; Cotton Yarn Shows Only Slight Gain

The yarn market was calm and quiet, with a slightly stabilizing trend. This was due to the sharp rise in the price of Indian cotton, which increased the cost of cotton yarn. As a result, general holders of yarn felt more secure, with most taking a positive view of the future and expecting a consolidation of the floor. Selling pressure eased, but actual demand remained stagnant. Transportation on various routes was difficult, preventing the rise of prices despite the renewed confidence. This was because current consumption and production were not yet in balance. It is expected that once business picks up, the market will develop.

At the opening of the raw yarn market this morning, people gathered to discuss the upward trend of cotton yarn, given the strong surge in the price of foreign cotton. Investor sentiment was strong, but sales were slow. Actual transactions were few, creating a slight disappointment. The opening price increased by 2 yuan to 632 yuan, and rose to 634 yuan during the day. Later on, the price retreated 2 yuan because of weak demand. According to half-day statistics, 939 bales were traded. Yesterday's transactions involved 415 bales. In terms of price, Shuangma brand 20-count yarn rose by 2 yuan, Tiannv by 4 yuan, and Shuangdiqiu by 5 yuan. 210 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Hong Kong today. The amount purchased by each group is listed below.

### Cotton from the Interior Arrives in Quantity; Fails to Keep Pace with Indian Cotton's Rise

Trading in local cotton was still supportable. However, factory demand was again subdued, because yarn sales were sluggish and factory inventories were again rising. As a result, intentions to purchase raw materials were relaxed. Japanese factories were in a similar situation, making trading increasingly depressed. Despite the sharp rise in the price of Indian cotton overseas, it was hoped that local cotton would also rise. However, the Shanghai market was poor, and at the same time, cotton from the interior was arriving in crowded conditions, creating a temporary constraint and preventing upward momentum. Nevertheless, most people were optimistic about the future. Over 10,000 bales of cotton from Subei arrived in the past two days. A large number were held by brokers, causing warehouses to be filled to capacity and creating a shortage of storage space. The prices at which raw cotton has been trading are recorded below.

In other news, in terms of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market opened very strong this morning, with active speculation. Buyers in Bombay were actively purchasing, causing some short covering. Spot goods remained exceptionally good. Closing prices rose five to six points from the previous day. The Indian cotton market also rose sharply by more than nine rupees due to the sharp rise in the price of jute and aggressive buying by speculators. A telegram received this morning reported that the market opened up another 10 rupees. Egyptian cotton rose by more than 30 points.

### Grains: Rice Speculation Slightly Eases; Japonica Rice Retraces a Little... Kexian Rice Relatively Firm; Foreign Rice Orders Approaching 10,000 Tons... Some Replenishment

The rice market, which had been rising steadily, suddenly softened yesterday afternoon after prices had gone up too much. Sources from various areas, including Sujia, Kuntai, and Qingfeng, arrived with 30 to 40 cartloads of goods, further dampening market sentiment. The previous rise had been too rapid, so when the market faltered, the decline was also sharp. Dealers from the interior mostly stopped trading, and local stores were also watching, only making minor purchases to meet immediate needs. The market's trading volume was the opposite of the previous frenzy. Hoarders, seeing that there was no more profit to be made and holding large quantities of high-priced goods, took precautions against the dangers of the market’s current volatility with the arrival of the new crop. Some sought to unload, and with a drop in confidence, their strategy suddenly changed from buying to selling, causing them to dump their inventory in a stampede. However, the downward trend was already in place, and it was difficult to reverse. All watched and no one was taking delivery, so they had to cut prices and sell at a loss, causing the drop to accelerate. Many brokers with unsold goods also rushed to offer samples. However, seeing that the market was deteriorating, potential customers' willingness to buy declined further, causing prices to fall further. As a result, prices plummeted by one to three yuan. According to statistics, total city trade volume was no more than 4,000 to 5,000 bags. The closing prices for Changte Jing were 38 yuan, for City brand 37 yuan, for Medium brand 36 yuan, Kunsu white Japonica 37 yuan to 34.5 yuan, Qing Sha Luzhong 34.5 yuan, and Feng Jia Luzhong 32 to 33 yuan, a decrease of 1 to 3 yuan compared to the previous market. Lu Yang Jian opened at 35.5 yuan and 35 yuan. Because of the shortage, the price remained unchanged, Kexian dropped more than a yuan. Jiangbei Jian sold for 34 to 35 yuan, Jing Wu Jian for 35 yuan, and second grade to 33 yuan, Yin Bian Yuan dropped about 2.5 yuan, Chen Yuan 37 yuan, Xin 36 yuan, Yin Yuan 35.5 yuan, 33 to 34 yuan. In conclusion, the sudden rise in rice prices during this time of abundant harvests and rising tide was entirely driven by hoarders. In this time of national crisis and difficult living conditions, hoarders only care about their own private interests and exploit the public. Such avarice cannot be tolerated.

In other news, Kexian rice was once again acquired by hoarders yesterday morning, and the market continued to move upward. Speculation and manipulation were rampant, and speculators were taking advantage of the upward trend. Due to limited supply and strong demand, market prices gradually rose. The morning market was raised by nearly a yuan, but after the high price, actual sales had long since stopped. Profit-taking was prevalent. As more foreign rice was being traded again, and Anhui and Jiangsu Kexian rice had already been shipped after hearing the news, small batches of 100 to 200 and 300 to 500 bags were gradually arriving in port. Goods on the way were also arriving in Shanghai in a continuous stream, softening market sentiment and causing the market to experience a reversal, plunging roughly 2 yuan. This was nearly a yuan less than the previous day. The actual trade volume for the day did not exceed 3,000 bags.

In addition to previous orders of 2,400 tons, 500 tons, and 1,000 tons of foreign rice, two more batches were confirmed yesterday. One batch of 1,000 tons was negotiated earlier and is goods ready to load at 35 yuan. Expected arrival is at the beginning of the month. Another batch of 4,800 tons, or some say 4,700 tons, will be shipped in the middle of next month and will not arrive until the second half of the month. The price is 35.02 yuan. There are a total of five batches of 9,700 tons, which is roughly 100,000 bags. The shipments are handled by Daufu Foreign Firm, and the order was placed by a joint organization of grain merchants.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trade saw Indian cotton priced about 20 yuan higher per picul than American cotton, so it has long been neglected. Recently, as the price of American cotton has risen daily, trading has eased. Factories have also stopped purchasing because yarn sales are sluggish. However, they are making some purchases of goods that are especially cheap. Below is the market price of American cotton, calculated at a spot exchange rate of 8.625 yuan to the dollar (excluding dock delivery tax):

Foreign Cotton Converted Market Prices Listed Below:

20 Count American Midling: 152.00

### Oil Market: 18 Companies Cooperate in Manipulation; Soybean Oil Rises Again, Hitting a High of 80

Yesterday morning, the oil market was relatively stable. Afterwards, buying interest increased, and barreled oil chased after the barreled oil, first soaring. The barrel oil company, formed by 18 companies cooperating, was again active in the market. As a result, barrel and barrel oil both reached new highs. According to statistics, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at an opening price of 56 yuan, 200 pieces of Qingqi oil at a price of 58 yuan, 400 pieces of Yanqi oil at a price of 59 yuan, 100 dan of local factory oil at a price of 62.5 yuan, and 50 to 60 barrels of Dalian oil at prices rising from 78.5 yuan to 79.5 yuan. In addition, 20 barrels of Qingdao oil sold for 77.8 yuan. Peanut oil also followed suit, with prices rising by 0.5 to 1 yuan. 300 barrels of peanut oil were purchased by the Hong Kong gang for delivery to Jiangbei at prices between 78.5 yuan and 79 yuan. 15 barrels of Qingdao barreled oil sold for 80 yuan, and 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil for 60 yuan. Yesterday, 170,000 bags of soybeans were shipped from Beisha.

### Piece Goods: Cloth Sales Slightly Increase; Guerrilla Areas Vigorously Purchase Domestic Cloth; Dongpi Fine Twill Shipped to Tianjin and Yantai

The rise of Dongpi cloth has led to a gradual turnaround in business for Yunnanese gangs and guerrilla areas in Jiangsu and Anhui. Additionally, the market has been weak for many days, and merchants' inventories are gradually dwindling. Many people are taking a positive view. At this time, when market prices are low, there is a lot of absorption. Factories are taking the opportunity to sell some of their inventory in order to generate cash flow. As a result, trading has increased slightly, and the market has stabilized, with little difference from the previous week. The main street saw sales of 10,000 odd pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, satin, and grey cloth. Over 5,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, printed cloth, and velvet were sold, mostly for dyeing and for resale in guerrilla areas. Yunnanese gangs have added 100 odd pieces of Dapeng, Fugui, fine cloth, fine twill, shilin cloth, and crepe de chine. Nanyang gangs have purchased 50 to 60 boxes of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and floral cloth. Cantonese gangs have purchased over 2,000 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, and floral patterns. 62 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 20th.

The Tianjin and Yantai gangs of the northern route were all purchasing Dong cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill yesterday, and merchants on this street were also eager to buy. The market continued to rise, with each piece surging 3 to 4 cents. The high price for Dragon Head Fine Cloth has already been bid for 18 yuan per piece, and Fine Twill 17 yuan. Colored goods, such as Four Gentlemen Serge and Zhigong, have also risen by more than one point per yard from Saturday. Bids for Serge in the aftermarket have been raised to 5.8 yuan, and for Zhigong, 6.075 to 6.1 yuan. Quite a few new hoarders have been absorbing stock, and the whole day saw sales of over 1,000 pieces of white goods.

Of the five West China League soccer cup competitions this season, the Zilin Cup already started the week before last. The International Cup has not yet been held. The Scott, Reserve, and Junior Cups all begin their first week of matches at the end of this week. A total of 14 teams are participating in the Scott Cup.

Lido, the champion of the last Scott Cup, hopes to win the title in Group A this year. Of course, they will not allow others to sleep soundly beside their bed.

### Fundraising for Refugee Production Fund: Preparation for Soccer Match, Lido and Donghua vs. West China League

A charity soccer match was launched last night at the Atlantic to raise funds for the refugee production fund. Lin Kanghou and Yan Jun, the manager of the cooperative, attended. Those from Lido and Donghua included Lu Zhongen, Li Baojun, Zhang Zhihe, Pan Huifang, Sun Jinshun, and Jia Youliang. The cooperative originally planned to invite Lido to compete against Donghua. However, because Donghua's generals were scattered, after discussion last night, it was changed to Lido and Donghua working together to fight against the West China League or the Military League. Personnel have been sent to contact the West China League, and it can only be determined after the West China League meets tomorrow to discuss it.

### A Brief Discussion on "Pornographic Literature"

— Sheng Dan

If "empty talk is enough to ruin the country," then why wouldn't "pornographic literature" exterminate the race!

Perhaps this is "alarmist talk"? The toxic ingredients contained in "pornographic literature" are definitely not as potent as heroin, because everyone knows that this is just "armchair strategy"; moreover, the currently popular erotic works not only cannot compare to the once popular "romance creations," even if they muster all their strength and desperately want to inherit the old mantle, they are obviously beyond their reach. Therefore, apart from attracting a few degenerate youths, "pornographic literature" is unable to expand its domain. Strictly speaking, the erotic works being produced now are simply not worthy of entering the literary world; if we acknowledge that this inferior current has literary value, it is tantamount to acknowledging that "erotic paintings" are works of art; crowning it with the golden crown of literature would be an insult to the sacred term. This view is naturally correct, but it only belongs to a distinction in nature, and has not taken into account the resulting effects and influence.

Those who defend erotic works must say that under the cold and depressing status quo, when a writer takes up a pen, it seems that someone is warning you, "Be careful!" Thus, a large number of erotic works are "born in response to the times." In fact, "be careful" is indeed a fact, but no one is forcibly grabbing anyone's wrist, writing things that destroy themselves.

However, there are many ways to defend it. It can also be said that people under the current situation need stimulation, especially high-spirited youths; then, the focus of the problem lies here. I think that there is nothing more effective for stimulation than opium or morphine. When you are constantly yawning, just inject a little into the bloodstream and you will immediately be refreshed; and a little bit, though insignificant, can sometimes converge into a torrent and cause people to suffer the disaster of drowning. Indirectly? There is no need to elaborate. It will invisibly weaken the courage to fight, obliterate the pure spirit of youth, and fulfill the wishes of those who pray for it.

We are definitely not moralists who want to raise any banner of defending morality, but the "talents of the foreign field" who are stepping up the creation of erotic works should not use "be careful" or "stimulation" as a reason to spread the poison that destroys society. Here, I must add another sentence: "Pornographic literature" cannot but exterminate the race!

### Road Worker

— Zhang Zhenshan

The misty and moist wilderness was stripped of its hazy coat by the morning sun. The mountain roads and earthen dams all clearly showed a patch of mud. I moved my steps, and the sound of my footsteps was like the chirping of insects in the shallow grass.

The morning glow is like a gauze curtain. The layered scales of clouds stretched to the distant sky; the violet-colored and gentle light and shadow dyed the surroundings with clarity and tranquility. Outside the desolate suburbs, deep and solemn, no villages, no plowing hooves were seen, stirring the open and lonely space, only the bursts of singing brought by the morning wind from the highway. Singing that rough and passionate tune, they are a group that refines the earth.

Dark faces, bright eyes, crimson arms, hard palms, and robust bodies all reveal the vitality transformed by wind and rain. They wield hoes and harrows, and shoulder carrying poles. Some are filling small ponds, some are shoveling away high hills, and some are chiseling open upright rocks. Their arms are like bird wings, gently swinging in the high sky, and their legs advance steadily. Those narrow field roads, dilapidated villages, dense forests, rugged rocks, and cliffs are all melted into flowing liquid in the fiery vitality and condensed into a long road surface.

Climbing up the hillside, the road surface followed and spread upward, gradually, gradually widening the winding path and leveling the undulating mountain road like a snake's body. The soil rolled like waves, flying up many ink flowers.

I mingled among the road workers, secretly marveling at the steep terrain and the greatness of the project of opening roads across the mountains in my heart. I wanted to ask Section Chief Duan, but I understood: they are road workers, they have climbed peaks higher than the clouds: they have jumped into abysses thousands of feet deep; they have also traveled thousands of miles, enjoying the early spring in Jiangnan and the cold winter in the north; wild beasts, ice and snow, torrents, flowers... everything I think is rare, they may have seen it plainly. I finally suppressed my childish thoughts and changed the subject:

"The waterfall pours down, as clear as the Milky Way in the sky. The vine-covered cliffs are like a bride wearing a colorful veil. Being a road worker not only contributes to the motherland, but also has many wonderful encounters. It's a pity I don't have the strength."

"Ha... ha..." Before he could speak, a burst of laughter attracted two road workers behind him to ask.

"What are you laughing at? Is there wine to drink?"

"No, he's laughing at your strength. Hey! Friend: I ask you, how much road have you built? How much road have you traveled?" I replied with such a playful smile, and then took the lead in asking with such a serious attitude.

"I built for two years and four months, passing through eight provinces. I dug trenches and also dug tank traps."

"Your achievements are truly not small. You are comparable to soldiers who charge into battle." I said with a smile.

"Don't flatter people too much. When we get to Chaowangzhuang, I'll treat you to a drink. Ha..."

He dragged out a long laugh, turned around, carried the mud pole up the hillside, and waved it shovel by shovel.

Sweat sprinkled on the soil, and singing rose again in the open space:—

A carrying pole on the shoulder, regardless of cold or heat;

A hoe shoveling, regardless of rain or shine;

Hey yo ho yo... Ho yo hey yo!

Building one journey after another, striving to complete the mission of national revival!

I looked at their backs, and I listened to their free singing, as if I was intoxicated in an early spring garden, surrounded by vigorous vitality and fragrance! Joy surged into my heart, and I excitedly rushed to another mountain peak.

### Yi He

— Lu Di

The raindrops lingered in the long sky, and the haze swallowed some days. On the turbulent earth, some people sighed that life was drifting, like floating clouds, saying that they would hold on tightly to the hand of hope every fresh dawn, and then secretly let go with a sigh in the evening, as if joyful, and then sad!

When I occasionally thought about the Qing life melancholically with a naive heart, this drop of indelible trace lingered in my imagination for a long time, and a sigh fell lightly on my heart, but in my pupils I finally wove another beautiful picture. Who doesn't, in the cold wind and slanting rain, see the sunshine flickering and jumping for joy, like the loud sound waves of our childhood: "Oh, the bugle sounds in the daytime, the wind and rain are defeated, sigh..."

One day, the wind and rain will come violently, and in the wind and rain, the bugle will also sound loudly...

And at this moment, just like at a fork in the road, I vaguely heard the low whisper of the autumn wind again. Thinking: Under the bad soil, the plane trees by the road have become thinner, and what should be thinner is the "traveler's heart"...

At the fork in the road, my footsteps were stuck and stagnant; a mixed stream of thoughts messed me up like a stone thrown into the water, I would yearn for a happy life in the distance, for an iron belief, and a trace of cowardice entangled me again, stirring up my nostalgia for the local customs; the hazy days really made me have a longing, a little ashamed! And a few days ago, from the corner known as the crown, a friend sent me these words:

"...Here, the days are cloudy and the sway is still the same. A wisp of regret, like a ghost, is always waving in front of me. I am annoyed that I left you and crawled here. Looking at it for a few days, it is again 'the mountain rain is about to come, the wind is filling the building', and I am still like a vine, silently muddled. You say, who can forget pain like forgetting happiness? I really want to go back, to your side and walk in the same steps with you..."

I began to feel lost, and my vague footprints were still admired by someone. A wisp of sadness deeply criticized me—that friend's hope should still be written on the water... However, a resounding sound, beyond the distant Guanshan, drifted from another world's loud sound.

Ah, I dissected it.—

"...In the blue sky,浩刧 is often seen here, but in the misty smoke, our eyes are not moist. Do you know? Freedom is to be exchanged for flesh and blood, there is nothing cheap to fall. It is said that the Guanshan Mountains are thousands of miles apart, you should always hear our chest beating like tree roots shaking the soil in the summer night: See Lian will also be heroic and spirited, flying through the long sky, everything here is so beautiful like a rainbow, you should spread your wings and leap up, fly like Teng and breathe the same breath as us, we are thinking of you with a heart of blessing..."

Looking at the letter, and pushing open the window to look at the distant clouds and mountains, what a deep imagination: "Yi He soars to the Milky Way, with a proud posture and snowy frost." That scene will be seen quickly. Taking out white paper, I excitedly picked up the pen!...

"...Like you and me, there is equally nothing to miss here, but you are willing to take the same steps with me—good, fly up! Go to Lian's place where there is no loneliness... gallop, impact, it should always be like this... holding a heart of iron belief, towards that blood's banner. Bless us, let us also breathe the same breath as them..."

### Dawn

— Pinpin

In my life, one of the sights that moved me the most was dawn. I have almost only seen such a dawn, I am very sleepy, and dawn often can't wait for me.

Last night, I went to see a friend who was staying in the school dormitory. I stayed and spent the night. I was really not used to it. I woke up at four and a half and walked to the campus alone.

The sound of the rooster that I vaguely heard in my dream is now even crisper. The crowing of a rooster is a good omen, probably a sunny day. Calm, but not the dead silence of the night. Two or three early-fallen leaves woke up on the muddy ground, gently jumping, and when they encountered dew, they stopped. Want to take a bath? Just right, a thin layer of heat has been shot down from the sky, and you won't get cold. The grass must be having a happy dream, otherwise why would it be so energetic? The big trees still stood upright and spirited, originally a team of honor guards, waiting for the arrival of dawn.

At the end is a river, and dawn can be seen in the river. The water is not turbid at all, but shines brightly, and still sounds very quietly. Birds accompanied the water to sing, chirping: "This person must be waiting for dawn."

I remembered Wordsworth's five-line poem:

The cock is crowing, the stream is flowing, The small birds twitter, The lake glitters, The green field is still unawakened under the light.

Light! I saw dawn! Light poured out from the clouds, golden, light red, egg white, woven into a brocade, leading to the gates of heaven. The sky unfolded like the chest of a giant, scaring the little birds into chirping and flying away. Everything was covered with light, bright, like newly carved gems. Majestic, open, vast, fresh, light! Unparalleled light! What can I use to praise you? I am running with open arms, my eyes burning with fire, and I feel that my soul is rising with the sunlight.

Dawn, creator of light, you are the gospel of mankind! How many people suffer in the darkness, and now, the shadows of demons flee, and people are saved. Dawn, the supreme dawn, you are the liberator, you are ours.

The long night will always pass, wake up, you who are sleeping, our dawn has loaded the light onto the flying car and is coming!

### The Great Enemy of Harm to People

— (M.Chin.15)

In the report of Dr. Van der Heyden, a physician of the Dutch East Indies government, it is said: "Among the laboring masses in Southeast Asia, most of them seem to be infected with laziness. What is the reason for this? It is infection with malaria. This is indeed an important issue, and the government should have a way to improve it." Indeed, when malaria invades a coolie, his work efficiency will not be as high as when his body is healthy. However, not only coolies in the Dutch East Indies are like this, but also coolies in tropical areas such as British India and South America are all like this.

Indian Dr. Hariharam said: "In a plantation, if 200 workers are usually needed, if malaria occurs, it is necessary to increase the number of workers to 300 before it is possible." According to Dr. H.G.S. Morin: "Even in French Vietnam, it is necessary to do so." The two doctors have the same conclusion, so the intensity of malaria can be known from this!

Therefore, if you do not often prevent malaria in advance when operating in tropical areas, dare to believe that your business is prosperous, you must not be an opponent in other places.

In 1923, a severe malaria epidemic occurred in Russia. As many as 112,500,000 man-days were lost nationwide due to workers being unable to work due to the infection. In Italy, workers lose an average of 10,000,000 man-days per year due to malaria, and 20 million acres of land are taken out of cultivation due to malaria; for this reason, the Italian government posted warnings everywhere, ordering people to take precautions, saying that the harm of malaria to people is like an octopus (centipede) sucking people's marrow and blood, with insatiable greed. The metaphor can also be said to be appropriate and easy.

After collecting reports from all parties, the League of Nations Health Organization considered malaria to be a major enemy of mankind and advised residents that the simplest and most economical method of prevention is to take quinine. Those who suffer from this disease, if they take quinine, the disease will definitely not be prolonged. The method of taking it is to take about 15 to 18 centigrams per day when you are sick. After five days or a week, the disease will definitely heal. If you are unfortunately infected with this disease again in the future, then take it as before, and the disease will definitely go away, so there is no need to worry in vain. However, if you want to prevent it before it happens, or if you want to maintain your health when the weather is bad, you must take 6 centigrams of quinine; if you do this, malaria, no matter how strong it is, cannot harm you.

### Introducing the Eleven-Year-Old Little Singer, Gloria Jean

— Wang Qi

Gloria Jean (Editor's note: Wouldn't it be smoother to translate it as Gretchen?) This name may not ring a bell for people in Shanghai, as she's only made a single appearance. However, in the spotlight of Hollywood, she surpasses any child star. When her debut film, "The Little Tease" (to be shown in Nanjing), premiered at the Strand Theater, it was an unprecedented event. The theater was packed, needless to say. When she was at the theater entrance, the roofs of three cars were trampled on, all to get a glimpse of her true face!

Gloria Jean, this is her beautiful name, her last name is Schoonover, born in Buffalo, New York. As for her singing voice, even Deanna Durbin is a bit inferior. Although they both sing high notes, Deanna's songs are high-pitched ditties, while hers are high-pitched classics.

As for her singing history, it's not short either. At fifteen months old, she could already sing the entire song "Little Annie Rooney." At three and a half, she was already a radio singing star, and at five, her singing voice was enough to perform stage operas. This singing talent is truly a gift from heaven.

She is eleven years old this year, four feet eleven inches tall, weighs sixty-five pounds, with blue eyes and brown hair. As for "The Little Tease," in addition to this little singer, there is the director Richard Wallace, known for "Woman Chases Man," directed by Robert Cummings and Nan Grey, the protagonists of "Three Smart Girls," produced by Universal Studios.

### Stone Spirit and His Peach Blossom Dream

— Zou Xiao

I knew Stone Spirit six or seven years ago. At that time, I was editing a publication, and Stone Spirit submitted a novel about peasant life, which was very profound, serious, and melancholic.

Last year, Stone Spirit worked even harder in literary writing. On the one hand, he used a pen name to write popular novels, which were published in translation newspapers. On the other hand, he read a large number of popular literature works and theories.

But his most earnest effort was in drama. He created a one-act play, "Let Go of Our Grievances," he compiled the "Drama Section of the First Year," and he translated Ibsen's "John Gabriel Borkman," which was published in "Literary New Tide." Recently, he has a five-act play, "Peach Blossom Dream," being staged at the Lafayette Theater. The original name of this play was "When They Awake," (This title reminds one of Ibsen's "When We Dead Awaken.") The script is published by the World Book Company.

Today, I saw Stone Spirit on the street, and he asked me for my opinion on "Peach Blossom Dream."

"A thunderstorm-type drama, after Chen Xihe's 'Deep Abyss,' now there's another one from you," I said.

"No, my main purpose is not in the family aspect, but in its background. That is, Qingdao twenty years ago. That is to say, who caused this sin?" he said.

"That's right," I said. "Your meaning is very subtle. A great era has a literary style of its own, and you can only write like this. I often think of Dostoevsky's 'Eastern Fables.' Perhaps the current Shanghai literature will gradually move towards fables? Your one-act play is different in technique from your recent works."

We smiled knowingly, shook hands, and parted. I watched a tall and sturdy figure disappear in the bustling city.

### Miscellany of Recent Days, Two Items

— Shi Wei Xuan

Wu Suqiu's second performance in Shanghai was greatly welcomed by the local people. Coupled with farewell commemorations, the box office was booming. Even though Wang Yurong provided support as an old patron, she might not be able to surpass it. Suqiu has a beautiful appearance and a moderate figure, making her a top female performer of late. I watched the performance for two consecutive days, both at the invitation of friends, not to promote the show. I am just a humble soldier, not qualified to promote anyone, and even if I wanted to, people wouldn't recognize me. However, I am fortunate to have seen three excerpts over two days. It's a pity that the excerpts, such as "Spinning Cotton," "The Spider Cave," and "The Peach Blossom Smile," are all between the old and the new, and cannot fully demonstrate her true skills, which is regrettable. "Spinning Cotton" allowed us to see her original face. The lyrics imitating the "Five Flower Cave" of the four famous Dan performers and Xiao Cuihua's "Large Patching Jar" were the most brilliant. She played and sang herself, and the piano music felt slightly jerky, perhaps because she was a beginner. Her singing was gentle and pleasant, so the applause never stopped. "The Spider Cave" had graceful dancing and accurate singing, which was quite satisfactory. In short, Suqiu's expressions and charm all suit the tastes of Shanghai people, so it is no wonder that she became popular with just one performance. Li Duokui is the only talented Laodan (old female role) performer of today, but her singing is not as thick as Gong's, and her acting is not as substantial as Gong's. This is also limited by natural talent. It is regrettable that the audience was noisy, like a tea room, so even with Li's abundant energy, it was difficult to hear clearly. Could it be that the audience's level is so uneven? Liang Huichao can be summarized with eight characters: "nimble hands and feet, lively figure." Judging from her style, she should specialize in short combat scenes, and it will not be difficult for her to establish her own unique style in the future. Chen Shaolin only sang "Stealing the Soul Bell," appearing on stage for a few lines, plus two solo performances. Finally, he wrote the four characters "Farewell Commemoration," writing them upside down horizontally, and when you stand them up to look at them, they become reversed characters, which can be said to be unique. Since he didn't sing much, and only appeared on stage for this one performance, it was a bit too cheap. Last night, he sang "The Charcoal Basin," and the scenes of poisoning himself with medicine and grabbing a handful of dirt were quite brilliant. The long Erhuang aria was smooth and flawless. Sun Shengwu's performance as Zhang Biegu was just right. The closing act was Suqiu's "The Peach Blossom Smile," which was quite capable of expressing the inner feelings of the daughter. The ten sections of lyrics had many new tunes, but the Sipin tune sung in her illness was not as lingering and touching as Wan Hua's "Life and Death Hate." Suqiu is suitable for playing the role of a small, exquisite, and lively daughter from a modest family, and "The Peach Blossom Smile" fits her well, so her performance became a masterpiece. During the third act, Mr. Chang painted "Autumn Colors by the Fence," a branch of colored chrysanthemums, sparse and elegant. Mr. Yu Qiaqing took the stage to give a speech and start the auction, starting from 75 yuan to 100 yuan and 200 yuan. Finally, Mr. Zhang won the bid with the highest price of 400 yuan. Also, Mr. Hu Yaoting bid up to 110 yuan, and although he did not win the bid, he was willing to donate to the refugee relief association. (Editor's note: Suqiu painted a fan and gave it to Hu to express her gratitude.) Suqiu and Messrs. Zhang and Hu have done no small service to the refugees. I would like to offer two suggestions to the management of the Xinsheng Theater: (1) The female attendants should be extra attentive in showing people to their seats and serving water. (2) Shouting and selling food should be absolutely prohibited except during the five-minute breaks, so as not to disturb the audience's viewing and listening.

### Amateur Music Community Initiates　Joint Music Concert Scheduled for the 22nd at the YMCA

— Tian Ma

Since "August 13th," the Shanghai art movement has largely come to a standstill. Recently, drama and literature seem to have gradually come to life, and the music scene is also growing under this "revival movement."

Amateur musicians Chen Gexin, Zhang Hao, Zheng Shouyan, Qin Pengzhang, etc. recently jointly initiated the holding of a "Joint Music Concert," scheduled for 8:00 pm on the 22nd in the auditorium of the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge. This news is not only a major event in the music scene this year, but also the beginning of a new era of music and singing art after the war.

The performance program includes the Aippolo Harmonica Team; "Song of Shanghai," with male and female movie stars participating in the singing; Hawaiian music, played by Hu Jing, Jiang Maoshi, Xie Youqian, etc.; Qin Pengzhang's pipa. There will also be a large chorus of more than 100 people, conducted by Zheng Shouyan, with Chen Gexin personally accompanying. There will be a national music performance by the Yinyuan Silk and Bamboo Orchestra, a violin solo by Mai Xia, a solo by Ms. Qian Qi, and a soprano solo by Ms. Xu Ping.

The growth of music and singing is undeniably a part of the "isolated island" art revival movement. Let us wish it a bright future!

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

Old Actors Rely on Skill for Food; New Performers Rely on Pumping Up Ticket Sales to Make Money

Who knew that fate would not go as planned? Old Tan was an extremely intelligent man, and he immediately changed the "Yan Qian" rhyme to the "Miao Tiao" rhyme, singing, "One day passes after another, my heart is like boiling oil, a three-foot knife hangs empty at my waist, I can't watch my enemy be killed." It was seamless, and he didn't reveal any signs of shock or error. On the contrary, he received a full house of applause because of it, and his reputation was not damaged at all. From this, we can see even more the true skill of the old actors. Nowadays, when acting, even ten-year-old children have to bring their own ticket sales personnel, partners, and followers, all of whom are hired by themselves. All the major supporting roles in a play are brought along, and the high and low notes are completely under their own control. Not only is there no one on stage who competes with you or causes trouble, but even the stage manager can't mess with you. What's so difficult about acting like this? When Wang Yurong came south this time, in addition to the above-mentioned conditions that new performers should have (i.e., bringing their own supporting roles, stage settings, partners, costumes, etc.), she also had the old patron Wang Yaoqing helping her, and there were also prominent figures in Shanghai promoting her, so of course she could become a big hit. In recent times, performers want to earn a monthly salary of 18,000 as soon as they come on stage, but in reality, they don't have much amazing skill, so they have to rely on people to promote them. Sun Juxian once had someone offer him a monthly salary of 2,000 yuan, and he was so shocked that he said, "I, Sun, don't have much skill. I'm afraid I won't be able to sell many tickets after I go on stage, and I'll make you lose money. I'll return the 2,000 yuan in full, and we'll talk about it after the tickets are sold." (145)
