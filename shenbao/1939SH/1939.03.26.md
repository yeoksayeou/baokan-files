### Japanese Troops in Northern Jiangxi Plan to Invade Nanchang in Three Routes; Chinese Troops Counterattack Separately, Situation Stabilizes; Central Route Continues to Hold Positions North of Tu Jia Bu; Fierce Fighting in Wan Jia Bu, Anyi, and Fengxin in the West; Confirmation of Deaths of Two Japanese Regiment Commanders, Iino, etc.

(Hong Kong) The Chinese army on the front line of Nanxun was still repairing the south bank of the river last night, firmly defending the area west of the railway. On the 23rd night, the Chinese army launched a counterattack, engaging in fierce fighting throughout the night, pushing the Japanese troops back to the line of Liu Zhuang Panxi City, which is now under Chinese control. There were no changes in the fighting in Wuning. The Japanese attempt to outflank the right wing of Wuning has failed. The fiercest fighting is taking place along the Liao River near the Wan Jia Bu and Anyi ferry crossings. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties, and several Japanese motorboats in the river were also sunk. Near Fengxin, the Chinese army also destroyed several Japanese tanks. A certain commander-in-chief has issued an order to commend the meritorious Chinese army. In the battle of Mantou Mountain on the south bank of the Xiushui River, Japanese Regiment Commander Iino was killed, and his body was recovered. (Special dispatch on the 25th)

(Changsha) In the battles on both sides of the Xiushui River and near Fengxin in northern Jiangxi, the Chinese army was able to concentrate its firepower to annihilate the Japanese army. In the battle in front of Mantou Mountain on the 23rd, a Japanese regiment commander named Iino was killed by the Chinese army. On the afternoon of the 24th, another regiment commander, Miyazaki, was also shot and killed by the Chinese army. On the evening of the 24th, the Japanese broadcast had already acknowledged the deaths of the two commanders. It is said that Iino was from Tokyo and was first shot in the leg. Before he could be carried away, he was shot again and killed. As for Miyazaki, it is said that he was from Wakayama Prefecture and had previously been wounded in action in Dongtai. (Dispatch on the 25th)

Guilin On the afternoon of the 23rd at 5:30 PM, a Chinese army unit killed Japanese Regiment Commander Waki Iwao at a high ground southwest of Chen Zhuang in eastern Wuning. Also, Iinotani Ju, who had filled the vacancy left by Tanaka Seizo, who died in the previous Battle of Wuhan, and served as the Japanese XX Division XX Regiment Commander, was also shot and killed at Mantou Mountain in Yongxiu at 10 PM on the 22nd. On the 24th, Japanese XX Regiment Commander Ejima Torao and Battalion Commander Takagi Kan were both seriously wounded near Bai Nao, northeast of Wuning. The intensity of the battle can be seen. (Dispatch on the 25th)

(Nanchang) On the Nanxun front, the Chinese army has always held the line north of Tu Jia Bu, and the Japanese army has not crossed the line. From the morning of the 24th, the Japanese army attacked Da Wang Miao, northeast of Tu Jia Bu, four times, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat. The Japanese army was finally repelled. (Dispatch on the 25th)

(Nanchang) The Japanese troops who had sneaked from Tanxi to Wan Jia Bu are now causing disturbances in the direction of Anyi and Fengxin, seemingly attempting to invade Nanchang. The newly arrived Chinese reinforcements arrived in time, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese army. The remaining Japanese troops were blocked and retreated northwest. (Dispatch on the 24th)

Xiushui The battles on both sides of the Xiushui River are gradually improving. The Japanese army, with a part of the 6th Division, attacked the Wuning area of the Chinese side from Zhuxi for five days. Not only did they make no progress, but they were also subjected to a major blow from the Chinese side. Starting on the 23rd, the Chinese XX Loyal Army, with the spirit of advancing without retreat and having China but not Japan, launched a counterattack from Wuning. In the fierce battles at Da Nao Jian and Coffin Mountain, 30 miles northeast of Wuning, for two days and two nights, they not only repelled all the attacking Japanese troops but also annihilated more than 1,500 Japanese troops. At the foot of Da Nao Jian and in Coffin Mountain, they captured more than 100 rifles, 12 machine guns, and hundreds of documents. More than 400 loyal Chinese officers and soldiers achieved their mission and died loyally in their duties. (Dispatch on the 25th)

Xiushui Several hundred Japanese troops who crossed the Xiushui River from Zhuxi Xijinkou sneaked to Luoping. They were bravely counterattacked by the Chinese army at dawn on the 23rd and were completely repelled. Before retreating, the remaining Japanese troops burned all the houses in Luoping Town. (Dispatch on the 25th)

(Nanchang) The Japanese troops north of Wucheng advanced on two routes, land and water, on the 24th. By noon, Japanese traces were found in the town. Residents who did not have time to evacuate were subjected to trampling. On the front line, the Chinese and Japanese armies engaged in fierce battles in the area of Tu Jia Bu, with the Chinese army gaining a clear advantage. The Japanese troops near Anyi on the left flank were repelled by the Chinese army and advanced west towards Jing'an, engaging in mixed warfare with the Chinese defenders. (Dispatch on the 25th)

Xiushui Wucheng, protruding from the lakeside at the confluence of the Xiushui and Gan Rivers, has stood firm since the 18th under the intense bombing of Japanese naval, land, and air artillery. On the morning of the 24th, more than ten Japanese planes and thirty or forty warships bombed and shelled for six hours, turning Wucheng Town into scorched earth. Most of the fortifications were destroyed. However, the loyal and brave Chinese army still used the ruined walls and broken ruins as cover, calmly resisting. At dawn, a Japanese warship team sailed south of the town and forcibly landed. Although the Chinese army was attacked from both sides, they were still fighting hard under difficult circumstances. (Dispatch on the 25th)

Guilin On the morning of the 23rd, the Japanese army advanced on the Chinese from Haxi Long Yejiazhou in several routes and fired a large number of incendiary bombs. At 5 PM, a fire broke out in Wucheng, and the current situation is unclear. The main force of the Japanese army on the Nanxun line is still engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army in the area of Wan Jia Bu, with part of it in Tanxi. (Dispatch on the 25th)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army is currently attempting to encircle Nanchang from three directions: east, west, and north. It is reported that one route of Japanese troops landing on the east bank of Poyang Lake is attempting to attack Nanchang from the east, with the immediate goal of cutting off the railway and highway traffic between Jiangxi Province and Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces. The central route of the Japanese army is advancing towards Nanchang along the Nanxun Road from Yongxiu. The third route of the Japanese army crossed the Xiushui River at Qiujin and is advancing south, attempting to cut off the main highway and railway line between Nanchang and Hunan Province. It is said that this route of the Japanese army is the closest to Nanchang and poses the greatest threat to the Chinese positions north of Nanchang. The vanguard of this route includes mechanized units and is reported to have reached Anyi and Fengxin, 45 miles west of Nanchang. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

(Nanchang) The Japanese troops at Coffin Mountain, Wang Ren Nao, Jia Bai Lao, and other places on the north bank of the Xiushui River were fiercely attacked by a Chinese army unit, resulting in many Japanese casualties. Yesterday morning, the Japanese army was unable to hold out and retreated towards the Fanxi Bridge. The positions there have been completely recovered. At the moment, the Chinese army is advancing towards the Dajiao River and the Hezhang Street area. The Japanese troops at Nanluopu on the Xiushui River were bravely counterattacked by the Chinese army on the night of the 23rd. The battle was extremely fierce. On the morning of the 24th, the Japanese troops fled east in disarray, and the area was also recovered. The remaining Japanese troops are currently being mopped up. (Dispatch on the 25th)

Xiushui After the Japanese army forcibly crossed the Xiushui River at Gouzi Ridge between Qiujin and Yongxiu, they used Tanxi as a base. On the 23rd, they divided into two routes: one advanced wildly along the highway towards Wan Jia Bu and Anyi, and the other rushed fiercely along the ancient road towards Ganzhou, between Anyi and Jing'an. After the Chinese army resisted separately, the Japanese troops attacking Wan Jia Bu and Anyi have been repelled. The Japanese army suffered more than 600 dead and wounded. As for the Japanese troops disturbing the area south along the ancient road, they are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army north of the Zhongliao River. (Dispatch on the 25th)

(Chongqing) According to military observers, the Japanese army's decision to attack Nanchang still employs its usual tactic of flanking attacks. Since the start of the war, the Japanese army has only won major battles through flanking attacks. At present, the Chinese and Japanese armies are engaged in fierce fighting along a 70-mile front along the Xiushui River. However, the Japanese army in the upper reaches of the Xiushui River has already advanced south along the highway towards Nanchang. According to military reports, the Japanese army has already advanced to Anyi, 20 miles east of Nanchang, and Fengxin, 30 miles away. The Japanese army is attempting to cut off the main retreat route of the Chinese army in Nanchang, 40 miles west of Nanchang. The Japanese army intends to cut off the Nanchang-Changsha highway, causing the entire Chinese army front along the Xiushui River to collapse. According to the Central Daily News, fierce fighting between the Chinese and Japanese armies is taking place along a 70-mile front along the Xiushui River, even more fierce than the fighting in the Shanghai area. In the past few days, more than 100 Japanese bombers have been busy taking turns bombing and strafing Chinese troop positions. However, the Chinese army positions in the Xiushui River basin are extremely solid, except for one loophole in the highway leading to Nanchang. All Japanese attacks along the Xiushui River have been repelled by the Chinese army. A Japanese brigade commander was killed by the Chinese army, but his name is unknown. According to the Sao Dang Bao, yesterday, 200 Japanese troops from the advance force, carrying seven armored vehicles, advanced to the Anyi and Fengxin area and encountered fierce resistance from the Chinese army. The result is unknown. (Associated Press dispatch on the 25th)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the fighting in northern Jiangxi is still raging. On the 23rd, the Chinese army launched a vigorous counterattack and, after repeated hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army, drove back the Japanese troops who had sneaked to the Fengxin area on the south bank of the Liao River. The Japanese army suffered more than 1,500 casualties and two regiment commanders were killed in action. The Japanese army's decision to launch a large-scale southward offensive still adopts a roundabout strategy, concentrating its main force and advancing south along the Liao River on the west side of the Nanxun Road, attempting to break through the main force of the Chinese army in order to cut off the traffic between Nanchang and Wuning Pingjiang. In addition to crossing the river from the south bank of the Liao River to launch an attack, the Chinese army is also advancing in a roundabout way from XX to encircle the flanks of the Japanese army. (Quick News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

(Hong Kong) The Japanese claim to have occupied Wucheng is incorrect. According to Chinese reports, Zhang Jia Shan, the outpost of Wucheng, is still in the hands of the Chinese army. Therefore, the claim that the Japanese army has entered Wucheng is difficult to believe. In addition, according to private news from Chongqing, the Japanese navy in Poyang Lake has not yet been able to land, because the Chinese army has set up artillery positions all along the west bank, and their range can reach 100 meters into the lake. Even if Japanese suicide squads dare to risk landing, they will all trigger the landmines pre-buried by the Chinese army and be completely annihilated. It is learned that the Chinese army in Wucheng has prepared for street fighting. Even if the Japanese army invades the city one day, every house will have fortifications, and the Japanese army will not be able to occupy Wucheng without paying a heavy price. (Fast News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

(Hankou) According to neutral sources here, the Japanese troops attacking Wuning are still being held back between Zhenghuang and Chuanle Towns (both transliterations). Unable to make progress on the front, the Japanese army is scattering towards Fengshui, hoping to break through the main force of the Chinese army. However, a small team that sneaked into Xiahu is now reported to have been wiped out by the Chinese army. (Quick News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

### Japanese Troops in Central Hubei Fail to Cross the River

(Yichang) On the morning of the 24th, hundreds of Japanese soldiers in more than 30 rubber boats and wooden boats, using intense artillery fire and 20 machine guns as cover, attempted to forcibly cross the river from the south side of Luohan Temple to attack Shayang. The Chinese army responded with fierce fire from infantry and artillery, sinking several Japanese boats and killing many Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops fled back to the east bank. At the same time, Japanese troops at Caojiakou, across from Zhangjia Township, also attempted to cross the river but were repelled by the Chinese army. A Chinese unit took the opportunity to cross the river at a certain place and attacked Caijiaxiang, capturing a great many spoils. The battle is still ongoing. (Dispatch on the 25th)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops in central Hubei have repeatedly attempted to cross the river near Luohan Temple to invade the west, but all have been repelled by the Chinese army. There was heavy artillery fire on both sides last night. (Quick News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

### Wan County, Hebei Briefly Recovered

(Luoyang) The Japanese troops who occupied Wan County and Bei Dian Tou, totaling more than 500, were besieged by a Chinese unit for two days and nights. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. On the night of the 18th, the Chinese army used elite troops to launch a fierce attack in several directions, rushing into the city and engaging in fierce street fighting for two hours, annihilating more than half of the Japanese army. The Japanese army could not hold out and fled towards Fangshun Bridge in Lu County. Wan County and Bei Dian Tou were recovered by the Chinese army. The Chinese army killed more than 200 Japanese troops, collected more than 70 Japanese corpses, captured 7 light machine guns, more than 60 rifles, and captured 3 Japanese soldiers alive. On the morning of the 21st, more than 500 Japanese troops came from Lu County as reinforcements and launched a counterattack against the Chinese army. The Japanese army used artillery fire to break through the city walls and engaged in street fighting with the Chinese army for two hours, killing more than 30 more Japanese troops. Because the Japanese army was numerous and the Chinese army was few, the Chinese army withdrew from the city. Wan County fell into Japanese hands again. (Dispatch on the 25th)

### 20,000 Japanese Troops Arrive in Nanjing

Ningguo Over the past week, more than 20,000 Japanese troops have been added to Nanjing, of which more than 10,000 have been divided into Jintan, Danyang, Jurong, Lishui, and other places. Zhenjiang has also added more than 10,000 Japanese troops. The Japanese troops in Jintan are also blocking civilian ships everywhere, claiming that they will attack Liyang in three routes.

### A Large Squadron of Chinese Planes Bombs Tianhe Airfield; All Japanese Planes Destroyed; Chinese Planes Return to Base Calmly

Shaoguan A large squadron of Chinese planes suddenly appeared over Guangzhou at 10 AM on the 23rd. The sound of the planes shook the entire city. The Japanese army was caught off guard, and the alarm had not yet been issued. When the citizens saw the Chinese planes coming, they gathered in the streets and looked up in admiration. When the Chinese planes flew over the Tianhe and Baiyun airfields, they saw more than ten Japanese giant planes and flew low to drop bombs. Where the smoke and fire rose, all the Japanese planes were destroyed. The Chinese planes, seeing that their mission was accomplished, calmly flew north and returned. (Dispatch on the 25th)

Wengyuan More than 300 Japanese infantry and artillery troops in the Conghua area advanced from Shenqi on the morning of the 23rd. A Chinese unit, together with the Self-Defense Corps, surrounded and fiercely attacked the Japanese troops on the nearby high ground. After several hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties and were unable to hold out, fleeing towards Shengang. In this battle, more than 50 Japanese troops were killed. (Dispatch on the 25th)

Wengyuan Chinese guerrillas are extremely active in the Shunde area. The Japanese troops in Daliang have been attacked repeatedly. They have been building fortifications in the suburbs for several days. On the 21st, the Japanese troops invaded Chongjian but were again fiercely attacked by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 22nd, they retreated back to Daliang. (Dispatch on the 25th)

Wuzhou Japanese warships have recently been active in the waters around Beihai. On the 22nd, a Japanese warship was spotted on Weizhou Island, and six Japanese warships were spotted at Haikou. On the 23rd, five Japanese warships were anchored off Guantouling. In the afternoon, a Japanese shallow-water warship escorted two Japanese motorboats, sailing close to the coast to survey. They were strafed by machine guns by the Chinese defenders, and the Japanese troops fled in disarray. (Dispatch on the 25th)

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army in the North River area has received reinforcements again. The Japanese troops in the Huaxian area have begun to move west starting yesterday, seemingly intending to invade Qingyuan northward. According to general observation, a major battle will break out again on the North River front in the next few days because the Japanese army is attempting to invade northward along the Yuehan Railway in order to echo with the Japanese army in the northern section of the Yuehan Railway and achieve its dream of opening up the Yuehan Railway.

Editorial

### The National Spiritual Mobilization in Shanghai

The National Spiritual Mobilization has already begun to be implemented in Shanghai. Many people are sincerely and enthusiastically working on it, while many others treat it as an empty slogan, talking about it weakly, and even more people hold an indifferent attitude, not knowing what it is all about. Although this is a phenomenon that inevitably occurs at the beginning of every movement; however, this spiritual mobilization is indeed too important, and it is especially necessary to promote it rapidly and universally in Shanghai, this isolated island. Therefore, we should loudly call for the Shanghai citizens to thoroughly understand, unite, and strive to participate.

In general, although social evolution has the inevitability of a material foundation, without the active engagement of human will, it cannot promote the rapid arrival of a new era and achieve the expected results. Regarding the situation of China's resistance against Japan, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Weapons are material, and the ability to use these weapons depends entirely on the spirit. Compared to the two, spiritual strength accounts for nine parts, and material strength accounts for only one part." Therefore, spiritual strength has a decisive effect in warfare; and in the past year and a half, the concentration of national will has been far from sufficient, so that the Japanese side has repeatedly tried to take advantage of the gaps to strike at the spirit of the Chinese people and win over hearts. Now, in the second phase of the war, where success or failure, prosperity or ruin are at stake, we must rise up in time, implement the National Spiritual Mobilization, and make it the basis for building an army, building the nation, overcoming the enemy, and achieving victory (Summary of Chiang Kai-shek's telegram). Furthermore, regarding the special situation in Shanghai, all four million citizens are Chinese nationals, but there is a lack of universal national salvation organizations, a lack of political leadership, and at the same time, the other side's propaganda and bewitchment are intensifying day by day. For the sake of strengthening the anti-Japanese front, how can we build a Great Wall of the will of the Shanghai citizens, gather the individuals of the four million citizens, and transform them into a unified anti-Japanese force? It is all the more necessary to promote spiritual mobilization.

Shanghai citizens should recognize that National Spiritual Mobilization is not a formula, not a slogan, but a guiding principle for practice. Shanghai citizens should recognize that National Spiritual Mobilization is not an idle article in the anti-Japanese war, but an important factor in striving for victory. Shanghai citizens should recognize that National Spiritual Mobilization is needed not only on the front lines, but also in the rear, and especially in Shanghai, this isolated island society.

National Spiritual Mobilization has an outline and implementation methods. Theory and practice complement each other, with connectivity and integrity; but Shanghai citizens may wish to examine the objective environment and subjective needs and especially emphasize the following points:

The five spiritual reform items of the Spiritual Mobilization are all important guiding principles aimed at the shortcomings of the Chinese national spirit and the needs of the anti-Japanese war. Among them, Shanghai citizens should pay special attention to the two items "The life of indulgence must be corrected" and "The divergent and confused thoughts must be corrected." Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the sound of cannons has become more and more distant, and the neon lights have become brighter and brighter. The songs and dances in the theaters have consumed so much of the strength of the anti-Japanese war. The current problem is not that Shanghai citizens do not know that living in indulgence is inappropriate, but that there is no strong organization to correct it. National Spiritual Mobilization is organizational. Shanghai citizens should use the power of this organization to implement the so-called "supervision and persuasion" work, and thoroughly clear the decadent air on the isolated island. Furthermore, since Shanghai lost government control, the majority of citizens firmly hold the belief that the anti-Japanese war will be won and the nation will be built. However, elements with unsteady beliefs or wavering wills also hide in the foreign concessions in corners that people do not pay much attention to, acting as echo chambers for the other side's dissemination of spiritual toxins. National Spiritual Mobilization can enable Shanghai citizens in the future to exert the power of organization, carry out a scorched-earth policy of national consciousness, and eliminate all toxic thoughts.

Secondly, the twelve articles of the National Oath are the wartime code of conduct for Chinese nationals, of which nine articles are of a nature of non-cooperation with the enemy. Shanghai citizens should especially abide by them. Originally, although Shanghai citizens are squeezed into special districts, they actually have, and are likely to have, traffic with the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The consolidation of the puppet regime in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the determination of Shanghai citizens to resist Japan, and the guerrilla war have a very important relationship. If Shanghai citizens can completely sever ties with the Japanese puppets, visibly and invisibly, it would at least be a fatal blow to the Japanese puppet regime in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Therefore, in order to express their determination to love the country, Shanghai citizens should actively strive to abide by the National Oath and thoroughly promote the non-cooperation movement with the Japanese puppets.

Again, the four million citizens of the isolated island lack universal national salvation organizations. Spiritual Mobilization is the most effective remedy. If spiritual mobilization organizations are universally developed in all groups, schools, families, and industrial and commercial service organizations, then not only can the above-mentioned life correction and thought correction be carried out through the form of organization, but all national salvation work can also be widely launched due to the strength of the organization.

### Anti-Comintern Pact to Expand into Alliance; Internal Conflicts in Japan; Possible Political Upheaval; Invasion of China at an Impasse; Arita Diplomacy at a Crossroads

(Tokyo) According to news from here today, the German suggestion to expand the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, to confront the democratic front, has sparked fierce debate within political circles here. It may even develop into a political crisis within the cabinet. The Prime Minister, Minister of the Army, Minister of the Navy, and Minister of Finance have held several discussions on this issue this week. A major decision regarding Japan's policy may be made soon. The Japanese Diet is scheduled to close today, which is expected to accelerate the Japanese government's decision-making. With parliamentary questioning out of the way, the government can freely implement its preferred plans.

Currently, a majority of cabinet members in Japan seem to oppose getting involved in the European political vortex. However, they are also unwilling to abandon the possibility of an alliance with Germany without securing better terms elsewhere. It is noteworthy that the normally conservative "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" also published an unprecedented editorial yesterday, advocating for a "stronger agreement" with Germany and Italy. The reason Japan is hesitant to immediately form a military alliance with the Axis powers into an anti-democratic front is that Japan needs assistance from democratic countries for the "reconstruction of China".

It is reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita has proposed a counter-proposal on this issue, namely that the military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan should only apply to operations against the Soviet Union. However, some political circles here believe that Germany and Italy would not accept this counter-proposal. It is rumored that the Japanese ambassador to Germany, Oshima, has already reached an agreement with the German side on this issue. Therefore, if Japan rejects the German proposal, Oshima may resign. It is even possible that Foreign Minister Arita and Prime Minister Hiranuma will also resign. The Soviet, Italian, and German departments of the Japanese General Staff also advocate forming a broad alliance with Germany and Italy. However, Army Minister Itagaki seems to only advocate using this alliance from an anti-Soviet standpoint. The Japanese Navy opposes concluding a broad alliance with Germany and Italy because, according to the German proposal, if a war breaks out in Europe, the Japanese Navy would have to go to Europe without guaranteed compensation for damages. Although the German-Italian cultural agreement was signed this week, it is clear that the Japanese government is expressing indifference to the Berlin-Rome Axis, as Japan is well aware that Germany's demands exceed the rewards it is willing to offer. In the ongoing Japan-Germany trade negotiations, Germany not only refuses to adopt a barter system but also insists on cash payments, so the future of the negotiations is not smooth.

It is also rumored that the Japanese Foreign Minister believes that the best way to resolve Japan's current difficulties is to cooperate with Britain and the United States. Although there is no such possibility in sight, Arita believes that if a third country (mainly referring to Britain, the United States, etc.) can provide substantial rewards, Japan can open the Yangtze River for the access of third-country merchant ships. The opening of Qingdao is regarded here as a sign that Japan is shifting its stance, allowing it to turn towards Britain. According to those familiar with the political situation, if the United States helps Japan economically to complete the development of North China, Japan will abandon the proposal for an alliance with Germany and Italy. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

(New York) Regarding the situation of the war between China and Japan, the Republican "New York Journal-American" recently commented, under the headline "Japan Has Almost Failed." It first stated that Japan's policy of conquering China by force has failed, and that it and Germany and Italy must feel frustrated as a result. Furthermore, the situation shows that the three countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan, have not been able to transform the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance treaty. "Regarding this matter, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita consulted Duke Saionji, an elder statesman of the country, and after discussions in the cabinet, a decision was finally made. The faction in Japan intending to conclude an alliance treaty with Germany and Italy, including personnel from the Navy and Army (who originally eagerly hoped to establish closer relations with various allied countries), had presented their proposals to the Emperor, but the Emperor, as usual, consulted the elder statesmen and was unable to get his wish. Although this resolution has failed, it should not be considered that the country's authorities no longer sympathize with the goals of Germany and Italy in Europe. It is only that Japan, in this global struggle, must wait until it is confident before allying with Germany and Italy and making a desperate gamble. As for whether German leader Hitler and Italian leader Mussolini can achieve victory, it is inherently uncertain, so it is reasonable for Japan not to hastily side with the losing side. However, the country's navy and army authorities are not yet willing to openly express such a view, in order to maintain their outwardly fierce but inwardly weak image," it said.

### Japan Plans to Win Over Germany; Returning Qingdao as Bait; Also Returning the Mandated Caroline Islands to Germany; This Move Has Great Strategic Significance

(Berlin) Unofficial political circles are now discussing the possibility of Japan returning Qingdao to Germany. Qingdao was occupied by Germany on November 14, 1897, due to the murder of two German missionaries. During the European War, Japan seized Qingdao from the Germans and returned it to China in 1922. Now it is back in Japanese hands, so there is talk of Qingdao being returned to Germany. However, many believe that there is a difficulty: the obstacle to Germany recovering Qingdao is that this move is incompatible with the carefully maintained Sino-German friendship. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

(London) The "News Chronicle" has learned that the Japanese government has proposed to Germany that it is willing to return the Caroline Islands in the Pacific to Germany, as a gesture of goodwill from Japan to Germany, and as an example for other countries occupying former German colonies. It is heard that this proposal is conditional on the Caroline Islands being returned to Japan after Germany recovers its former colonies from Britain and France. The Caroline Islands consist of 500 islands, located between the Philippine Islands and the Marshall Islands, with a land area of 380 square miles and a population of 40,000. The islands were first discovered by the Portuguese in 1537, and later purchased by Germany in 1899 for 25 million Portuguese pesos. In 1919, the League of Nations entrusted Japan with their administration. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

(London) The Labor Party's "Daily Herald" recently reported that Berlin sources said yesterday that Japan intends to cede Jiaozhou Bay in China to Germany. "Although the area is a good base commercially, if Japan transfers it to Germany, the strategic significance will undoubtedly be greater than the economic significance." The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" stated that the Japanese government is rumored to have proposed to Germany that it is willing to return the Caroline Islands in the Pacific (currently administered by Japan) to Germany, in order to express goodwill and set an example for other countries to return old colonies. "But it is attached with a peculiar condition: that if Germany recovers its old colonies from Britain and France, it should still return the Caroline Islands to Japan," it said. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

(Berlin) A British dispatch said that Germany hopes Japan will return Qingdao. Local people were very surprised when they heard this. It is thought that rumor-mongers want to stir up anti-German sentiment, so they made slanderous remarks. German officials said that they had not discussed the Qingdao incident with Japan, and even that the German authorities had not thought of this. (Haitong dispatch, 25th)

### Japan-Germany Trade Negotiations; Soon to Be Completed; Barter as the Principle

(Tokyo) It is heard that Japan and Germany will sign a new trade agreement based on barter at the end of May or the beginning of June. These negotiations can be completed in early June. Under the new conditions, German exports to Japan will be doubled compared to before, while Japanese goods exported to Germany will be three times as much as before. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

### Anti-Comintern Pact Transformed into Military Alliance; U.S. Has Not Received Formal Report

Washington The State Department did not offer any official criticism yesterday regarding reports that Germany, Italy, and Japan are preparing to expand the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance to confront the united front of democratic nations proposed by Britain. However, State Department officials expressed their belief that this report is completely unfounded. They said that, according to their observations, the government has not received such a report. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

### Japanese Side; Morale Shaken

(Hong Kong) Recently, some Japanese people have expressed doubts about the establishment of the puppet regime and made pronouncements. The Japanese side in Shanghai issued an order to various places on the 18th to prevent this. The content of the telegram roughly stated, "Since the incident, there are Japanese people who are taking advantage of the situation to engage in improper behavior, which may become an obstacle to the new regime. The Army Department should formulate measures to crack down on them," and the criteria for determining "improper behavior" include "those who use rumors and gossip to disturb people's hearts." This is enough to prove the state of shaken morale on the Japanese side. (Dispatch, 25th)

### Japanese Army in Suiyuan Increases Troops in Baosuo

Yu Ji: There are no major changes in the situation of the Japanese army in Suiyuan. However, in the past month, the puppet Mongolian army stationed in Baosuo counties has repeatedly shown anti-Japanese sentiments. The Japanese army is panicked and has transferred 2,000 infantry and cavalry from Zhangjiakou to guard Baosuo and closely monitor the situation. According to information gathered from various sources, the Japanese army's decision to increase troops in Baosuo is purely to prevent a counterattack by the puppet Mongolian army and has no intention of invading westward.

### Soviet Union Fully Prepared to Deal with Japanese-German Threats

Red Army Holds Large-Scale Maneuvers in the Western Border Region

New Railway Completed for Convenient Military Transportation

(London) The Times reports from Moscow that the Red Army has begun maneuvers throughout the western border region of the Soviet Union, from Leningrad to Belarus. The commander of the Kiev Military District, Timoshenko; the commander of the Belarus Military District, Gavrilov; and the commander of the Leningrad Military District, Meretskov, all returned to their respective defense areas from Moscow before the end of the Communist Party Congress in order to review the exercises. Defense Commissar Marshal Voroshilov arrived in Minsk today, and Marshal Budyonny has arrived in Leningrad. In the past few days, large-scale tests to resist aerial and gas attacks have been conducted in Minsk and other places. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

(Washington) According to predictions made today by diplomatic and trade experts, due to recent developments in Europe, the Soviet Union will gain an important new position in Western Europe in times of emergency. Trade authorities here believe that trade agreements will be signed between Britain and the Soviet Union and between Britain and Poland after the Hudson trade delegation visits the Soviet Union and Poland. Neutral political observers here believe that Britain and France have indeed abandoned their views of underestimating the Soviet Union's power and prestige. They believe that the hope of a "contain Hitler" agreement between the four countries of Poland, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France is high. Some observers believe that the Soviet Union is fully prepared to prevent further German expansion eastward. They expect Hitler to take a short break after this victory and reorganize the territories he has acquired. Experts on Far Eastern affairs believe that the Soviet Union has shown confidence in dealing with the combined threats of Japan and Germany, as the Soviet Union believes that Japan's invasion of China has left it with no time to look elsewhere, so the threat is not very great. Recently, the Soviet Union completed the Trans-Siberian Railway between Ulan-Ude and Kyakhta on the Mongolian border. The newspapers did not give much publicity to this, but people here believe that this is extremely important. The railway is connected to the completed highway to Ulan Bator. Far Eastern experts believe that if war breaks out, this new railway will be of great strategic importance. They said that the Japanese have said that Vladivostok has 70 Soviet submarines and more than 50 powerful torpedo boats. In the summer of 1938, the Soviet Union built two new destroyers in Leningrad and then sent them to Vladivostok to reinforce the Far Eastern Red Army. The strength of the army there has been strengthened since the border conflict between the Soviet Union and Japan last year. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

### Germany Forms Huge Military Camp in Central Europe

(Berlin) The unification of Germans scattered throughout Eastern and Southeastern Europe to form a federation has been a long-standing desire of the German people. After centuries of failure to achieve this, National Socialist Germany has now begun to realize it. The newspapers thus commonly refer to Führer Hitler as the "creator and expander of the German nation," truly the heir to the great emperors of the ancient Roman Holy Roman Empire. As the overall situation is trending in this direction, the countries in Eastern and Southeastern Europe whose territories border Germany and which have minority ethnic groups struggling to live within their borders, such as Poland, Hungary, and Yugoslavia, are under great threat and risk being controlled by Germany. As for how Germany is dealing with this trend, one only needs to look at the protection agreement concluded between the country and the Slovakian state and the supplementary commercial agreement concluded with Romania to see a glimpse. The intention of the German-Romanian agreement is to closely link the economic structure of the agricultural country with the German economic structure, so that Germany can form a huge iron factory and military camp in Central Europe, drawing the raw materials it needs from the neighboring agricultural countries. Speaking in terms of international politics, this also has significant causes and consequences. In essence, in order to prevent attacks from Britain and France, Germany still needs Italy's assistance, but it does not want Italy to start a war. Informed sources in the National Socialist Party believe that, with the current international transformation, a new migration movement has occurred among the peoples of Europe, and the German nation has abandoned its path of westward expansion and changed to eastward expansion. In the course of this eastward advance, although it has been obstructed by the conspiracies of various democratic countries, if a country like Poland can submit rationally, and the determination of the Soviet Union's fate is not far away.

### Poland Advocates for Four-Power Military Cooperation

Britain Must Bear Concrete Responsibilities; Rumors of Germany Increasing Troops on the Polish Border

(London) Polish Ambassador Raczynski visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon and discussed the results of the talks by cabinet members from Britain and France, but did not make any new suggestions regarding the issue of a collective security system for Eastern Europe. Regarding this matter, British Ambassador to Poland, Sir Kennard, is conducting talks with the Polish government. Everything must wait until Foreign Minister Beck visits Britain in early June before a decision can be made. According to reliable sources, the Polish government advocates that Britain, France, Poland, and the Soviet Union should immediately conduct talks on military issues before issuing a joint declaration or convening an international conference. As Germany has threatened Poland since reclaiming the Memel region and signing an agreement with the Slovakian state, it is eager to work with Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to prevent Germany from continuing to advance eastward, but with the following four conditions: (1) The Soviet Union and Poland should formulate a plan for military cooperation; (2) The existing mutual assistance agreement between France and the Soviet Union should be amended in light of the changes in European territory; (3) The obligations accepted by Britain should be clearly stated; (4) The language of the joint declaration must be clear and specify various acts of aggression, so that the countries concerned can immediately implement mutual assistance in the event of such acts. If the above conditions can be realized, Poland can join the collective security plan for Eastern Europe proposed by Britain. In addition, there is a clause in the agreement signed between Germany and the Slovakian state that allows Germany to build military bases in the state's border area near Poland's military industrial center. Upon hearing this news, the Polish government intends to protest to Germany. (Havas dispatch, 24th)

Warsaw It is rumored that Germany has increased the number of troops and strengthened defenses near the Polish border. Upon hearing the news, the Polish authorities have been closely monitoring the border area. In addition, disturbances have occurred recently in the province of Silesia, which is close to the German province. Unidentified people have posted swastika signs in various thoroughfares, and it is heard that German soldiers have attempted to invade the Polish city of Bogumin, resulting in a conflict, but this cannot be confirmed.

### British Labour Leader Criticizes Government

Repeated Policy Errors Plunge Nation into Crisis

(London) Opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee delivered a speech in Winsborough this afternoon, fiercely criticizing the government's current policy and saying that there was no room for discussion at this time for the Labour Party to join the cabinet. He said, "The government authorities, in the name of national unity, have called on the Labour Party to join the cabinet. Foreign Secretary Halifax even made a speech in the House of Lords on the 19th of this month, saying 'collective security.' The government admits failure, and there has never been such a thing. Five days before the Green Foreign Secretary spoke, Finance Minister Simon expressed opposition to the principle of collective security. The promises offered by the current cabinet at the beginning of its tenure were not made in good faith, and the admission of failure is clear evidence of this. The government authorities, while admitting that peace cannot be maintained unless the collective security system can be established, have, in practice, consistently opposed the establishment of a collective security system. As a result, the country has been plunged into a war crisis, the strength of democratic countries around the world has been weakened, and the confidence of the British people has been shaken. It is no wonder that a government that has failed so many times still hopes for the support of the people. As for calling on the Labour Party to join the cabinet, it is simply incredible."

General opinion is also deeply impressed by recent events in Central Europe. Therefore, the Premier's speech tomorrow will undoubtedly attract worldwide attention. Moreover, the government's invitation to foreign envoys to attend the event further underscores the importance of this address. The Premier is expected to address Italy's various aspirations, seeking a clear explanation and firmly declaring Italy's commitment to peace. (Havas, 25th)

### Japanese Military Budget Reaches 9.4 Billion Yen

Parliament Passes Entire Budget; Closing Ceremony Today

(Tokyo) The 74th regular session of the Diet will be extended today. All 89 important government bills, including many related to the China Incident, have been unanimously approved by the Diet. Various budget bills including military expenses for the China war total 9.4 billion yen. The strong cooperation between the government and the Diet during this session is rare and has been one of the quietest in recent years. The Diet closing ceremony is scheduled for Sunday at the House of Peers. The Emperor will not attend the ceremony. (Reuters, 24th)

(Tokyo) The 74th Diet, which is scheduled to adjourn today, has passed all budget bills for the next fiscal year starting April 1, totaling 9,409,541,000 yen, including the following items: (1) Basic recurring budget: 3,694,666,000 yen; (2) First supplementary budget, namely the army and navy rearmament plan: 910,543,000 yen; (3) Second supplementary budget, namely the expenses of various departments including the army and navy: 199,332,000 yen; (4) Special military expenses budget for the war in China: 4,605,000,000 yen.

Seven Slovakian Planes Shot Down

Budapest: A statement issued here today stated that fierce fighting has broken out on the border between Slovakia and Hungary. The Hungarian government has warned the Slovak government that if a satisfactory resolution is not reached, Hungary will be forced to use stronger military force. Slovak planes have bombed three Hungarian towns. The Hungarian Air Force retaliated by bombing the Igló airfield. Hungarian anti-aircraft guns shot down seven Slovak planes and forced one to land. The pilot, a Czech major, has been captured. The statement concludes that Hungarian troops have not retreated an inch during the fighting. (Reuters, 25th)

Prague: Well-informed sources here recently announced that several Hungarian military aircraft had flown over and bombed the Slovakian city of Spišská Nová Ves. These aircraft are reportedly Italian-made Caproni models. In addition, several Italian-made hand grenades were found on the battlefield outside the town of Pavlovce nad Uhom in the same region. (Havas, 25th)

Capital of the Slovakian State: Although Hungarian troops continued to withdraw from the Slovakian State today, fighting broke out again along the border. At 4:00 PM, Slovakian troops launched an offensive in the Sabaha area, immediately crossing the border into Carpathian Ruthenia as far as the Gedáš area. Another unit also entered Carpathian Ruthenia and blew up the bridges in the Pavlovce nad Uhom area. At 5:00 PM, the Slovakian Air Force launched an attack, bombing the Hungarian city of Michalany, destroying oil storage facilities and ammunition depots. Hungarian planes immediately took off to intercept. Two Slovakian planes were shot down. In addition, Hungarian troops launched an offensive against the city of Spišská Nová Ves from the south (the city is located in eastern Slovakia, about 100 kilometers from the border with Carpathian Ruthenia), immediately engaging with Slovakian troops. (Havas, 24th)

Bratislava: The Slovakian Ministry of Defense issued an official report last night stating that a squadron of Slovakian bombers attacked Sobrance (a town in Slovakian territory, but currently occupied by Hungarian troops) yesterday, dropping multiple bombs on a Hungarian tank convoy and motorcade.

### Slovakia Accepts Hungarian Proposal

To Organize Joint Committee for Boundary Negotiations

Bratislava City: After Slovak Foreign Minister Ďurčanský protested to the Hungarian government yesterday about the Hungarian army's intrusion into its territory, the Hungarian government immediately proposed the formation of a joint committee to delineate the border between the two sides. It is now known that the Slovak government has accepted this proposal, and its representatives are scheduled to travel to the Hungarian capital on the 27th of this month for negotiations. According to front-line news, the positions occupied by Hungarian troops and Slovak troops have stabilized and there have been no changes. (Havas, 25th)

Budapest: Official sources here declared that regarding the border dispute, the Hungarian government has requested the Slovakian authorities to send representatives here for negotiations. If the Slovakian side can appreciate Hungary's spirit of compromise, it "can, according to the status of an autonomous state, jointly determine the border with Hungary". (Havas, 25th)

### Romanian-Hungarian Discord

Germany to Exert Pressure to Demobilize Hungarian Troops

German-Hungarian Economic Negotiations Underway

Bucharest: After Romania and Germany concluded a supplementary commercial agreement, official sources here generally said that Germany would soon pressure the Hungarian government to demobilize its troops. If Hungary cannot obtain German aid in spirit and in material, it will not be able to take any action against Romania and will inevitably accept German advice. However, whether Romania and Hungary will from now on dispel their suspicions and become friendly is still unknown. The reason why Romania decided to accept German demands and sign a commercial agreement with it was because it was concerned about the deployment of Hungarian troops on the border. The wounds are still fresh and it is difficult to forget quickly. On the other hand, Hungary's plan to recover Outer Transylvania originally had a glimmer of hope, but it was ultimately frustrated by the constraints of the situation and became a mere fantasy. However, it is conceivable that the hope is rising higher due to such stimulation. In short, Romania and Hungary could have laid the foundation for understanding after Hungary occupied Carpathian Ruthenia (Hungary had promised to return the areas inhabited by Romanian minorities in that province to Romania). However, in reality, they still clash with each other and give Germany the opportunity to manipulate them from the middle. Therefore, as far as the current situation is concerned, although there is no doubt that the Hungarian army will be demobilized, there is no hope that the situation in Europe will ease as a result. (Havas, 25th)

Bucharest: The Romanian government is negotiating with the Hungarian government on the demobilization of Hungarian troops through diplomatic channels, and before the negotiations achieve results, it will continue to take military measures in preparation for contingencies. Reserve soldiers in all parts of Outer Transylvania (which belonged to Hungary before the European War and now belongs to Romania) are enlisting enthusiastically, and some have volunteered before the call-up order was issued. However, Romania's selection of locations for border defense forces to be stationed are all at a considerable distance from the border line in order to avoid causing disputes. (Havas, 25th)

(Berlin) According to reliable sources, Germany and Hungary are conducting economic negotiations, and a commercial agreement is expected to be concluded in a short period of time. Its importance will at least be equal to the German-Romanian commercial supplementary agreement. (Havas, 25th)

### German-Romanian Agreement Regarding Oil Section Does Not Hinder Anglo-French Rights

Bucharest: After the German-Romanian commercial agreement was concluded, Romanian officials repeatedly consulted with the British Minister to Romania during the negotiations in the days before the final decision. It is reported that the British Minister advised the Romanian government to make some concessions in principle, and to try to remedy the situation during implementation, in order to avoid immediate disputes. At the same time, Britain is also willing to protect Romania's future and prevent it from suffering irreparable damage. According to the German-Romanian agreement, the companies jointly established by Germany and Romania are only limited to developing new oil wells. That is, the operations of the oil wells of the British, American and French companies have not been hindered, nor have they been restricted to selling oil to Germany. (Havas, 25th)

(Paris) The supplementary commercial agreement signed between Germany and Romania was recently commented on by responsible persons here, stating that the rights obtained by Germany in Romanian coal and oil are limited to undeveloped oil wells. France, according to the French-Romanian commercial agreement of 1935, the rights enjoyed by the existing coal and oil wells in Romania are not hindered. (Havas, 24th)

Bucharest: According to information gathered here, the economic agreement signed between Germany and Romania the day before yesterday has begun to be implemented. The first batch of military supplies has been shipped from Germany to Romania. The newspapers here today expressed satisfaction with this matter, believing that since German military supplies have been shipped, it must mean that Germany has no ambitions to invade Romania. (Haitong News Agency, 25th)

### New German Financial Plan to Raise Funds for Military Expansion

Issue Interest-Free "Tax Bonds"

Mandatory Subscription by National Business and Industry

(Berlin) The German government announced a new financial plan yesterday, stipulating the issuance of "tax vouchers" from May 1 this year to make up for extraordinary expenditures not covered by regular tax revenue. Financial Secretary Reinhardt specially hosted a press conference yesterday to explain the new plan, declaring that the government has decided to issue interest-free tax vouchers from May 1 this year. Those who have contracts with the national, provincial, municipal governments, as well as railway, highway and other public institutions, must accept 40 percent of the payment in tax vouchers when accepting any amount of payment. After acceptance, it can be transferred to industrialists for settlement. After accepting it, industrialists can transfer it to others or save it. Tax vouchers are divided into two types. The first type can be paid to the financial authorities at face value seven months after the date of issuance, or to pay the import tax. However, if the voucher holder saves it, the voucher holder can increase the total amount of tax vouchers held by 20 percent after ten months and include it as part of the depreciated assets on the annual statement. The result can reduce the tax by 10 percent of the face value of the tax voucher. If it is saved for another year, the percentage of tax reduction will be higher. The German Ministry of Finance stipulates this preferential method, hoping that the need for this tax voucher will be greater than the second type. The German government may not return the principal of the voucher until five years, ten years or even decades later. As for the amount not covered by the tax rate reduction, it shall be supplemented by increasing income tax, and administrative expenses shall be reduced to support it. The second type of tax voucher cannot enjoy the benefits of the first type of tax voucher and must be paid to the government to pay taxes at 112 percent of the face value 37 months after issuance. In other words, from the second year, the value of this tax voucher increases by 0.33 percent every month. This type of tax voucher can be mortgaged in banks, and banks can also buy or sell it. In short, the purpose of the first type of tax voucher is to absorb the floating funds in the economic organization, while the purpose of the second type of tax voucher is to absorb the funds outside the economic organization.

(Berlin) The government announced a new financial plan today, which will be implemented from May 1 this year. The focus is on the issuance of interest-free "tax vouchers", which are forced to be subscribed by industry and commerce, and used to prepay next year's taxes, and used as temporary expenditures for military expansion, and there is no need to use public bonds to raise funds. Deputy Minister of Finance Reinhardt issued a speech to explain it, saying that the tax revenue was 6.8 billion marks in 1933, and it has increased to 17.5 billion marks in 1938, which is still not enough to cover various temporary expenditures. However, using bond raising to raise funds will only increase the difficulty of the national treasury. This is why the government decided to issue interest-free tax vouchers. In the future, all goods purchased by the central government, local governments, railway companies, postal models, and other legal entities can be paid with this type of tax voucher for 40 percent of the selling price. This method applies not only to mainland Germany, but also to the province of Austria and the Sudeten area. Observers commented that there are two main points in this plan: (1) Tax vouchers are divided into two types: Type A, which starts to circulate seven months after issuance, and permanently circulate in the market, and does not return the principal, and can be used to pay taxes and tariffs, and those who store it for a longer period of time, until ten months later, will be given a "premium", which is especially allowed for export industries. All items of more than 500 marks can be paid with 40 percent of the total number of tax vouchers. Type B, which will not be used until three years after issuance, will have a premium of 12 percent. (2) An additional income tax is levied, and the increase in income since 1930 is used as the calculation standard, and this year, an increase of 35 percent is used as the calculation standard. Since Germany has actively expanded its military, millions of workers have obtained work as a result, and the purchasing power of the people has also increased accordingly. However, due to the increase in the production of armaments, other types of production have been reduced, and as a result, the people have obtained assets and have no way to spend them. The government authorities have set up an additional income tax to reduce purchasing power, thereby reducing the difference between production and purchasing power. (Havas, 28th)

### US Next Year's Army Expenses

More than 51 Million Yuan Approved by Senate Budget Committee

(Washington) The Senate Budget Committee recently passed the 1939-40 Army budget, totaling $513,188,782 (the 1938-39 year was $460,201,254), an increase of $13,330,938 compared with the original proposal passed by the House of Representatives on the 3rd of this month. $1,000,000 will be used to conduct scientific research work, $6,000,000 will be used to purchase machinery needed by various ordnance factories, and $332,480 will be used to reform the army artillery. According to President Roosevelt's proposed military expansion plan, the army's budget was originally $450,000,000.

### China Exchange Fund Bill Passes First Reading in British Upper House

Labour Party Amendment Rejected

(London) The China Exchange Fund Bill was given its first reading in the House of Lords today and is scheduled for a second reading on February 27th. Labour MP Lawrence moved an amendment today before the third reading of the bill in the Lower House, seeking to delete the clause guaranteeing British banks 2.75% interest if the Chinese government fails to pay interest on the banks in China. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon said at the end of the debate that when the bill was given a second reading, the Lower House had clearly expressed its unanimous sentiment that Britain was now making a beneficial contribution for the true interests of peace and was providing assistance to those who deserved it. He had great confidence that if the Chinese government continued its highly honourable practice of striving to fulfil its obligations, the British government would not need to fulfil the guarantee on interest. The Labour Party amendment was subsequently rejected at the review committee. (Reuters, 24th)

### Japanese Building Strong Military Works Around Shanghai

Apparently Seeking to Take Advantage of Europe's Troubled Times to Eliminate Democratic Nations' Rights and Interests in Shanghai

(Chongqing) According to well-informed sources, due to the grave situation in Europe, Japan is constructing solid military installations around Shanghai to nullify the defenses of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. Japan evidently intends to exploit the future outbreak of war in Europe to forcibly eliminate the political power of various democratic countries in Shanghai. New artillery emplacements in the Wusong and Doushan areas have been completed, making it absolutely impossible for foreign warships to pass through the Yangtze and Huangpu River estuaries. Moreover, the suburbs of Doushan and Wusong have become military strongholds, with entry and visits prohibited. Japanese military authorities have also completed four barracks near Shanghai, capable of housing 20,000 troops. Furthermore, "artillery outposts" have been built at various locations around Shanghai, such as the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, Liuhang, Yanghang, Hongqiao, etc. All these measures are aimed at encompassing the foreign concessions in Shanghai under Japanese military rule, turning Shanghai into a Japanese stronghold in the Far East.

### Domestic and International Situations Increasingly Pressing, Hiranuma Cabinet's Future Dim

War Expenditure Budget Already Exhausted

General Sentiment Eager to End the War

To speculate on the future of the Hiranuma Cabinet, one must first understand its nature. Recognizing the Hiranuma Cabinet can, as usual, be analyzed from both subjective strengths and objective circumstances. Simultaneously, one can make a comparative observation of the composition of the Hiranuma and Konoe Cabinets, even though the Hiranuma Cabinet is merely an extension of the Konoe Cabinet, or one could say the two are the same.

The Subjective Strengths of the Hiranuma Cabinet

Regarding subjective strengths, Japanese Diet member Kohno once made the sweeping assertion: "The Hiranuma Cabinet is the least popular cabinet in Japanese history." If we elaborate on this statement, then, first, Hiranuma Kiichirō himself has always been suspected by those responsible for recommending the Prime Minister and the elder statesmen and influential figures whose ideological form somewhat influences Japanese political trends; second, even the upper echelons of the financial world view him as a dangerous figure due to Hiranuma's usual high-profile advocacy of "innovation"; third, the Army and Navy Ministries do not show firm trust and ardent support for Hiranuma, so they presented seven conditions when he came to power; fourth, the political parties' antipathy towards the Hiranuma Cabinet has been fully expressed in the interpellations of the current Diet session, which need not be detailed further. The conditions of Prime Minister Hiranuma himself are like this, and the conditions of his cabinet members are even more base and clumsy. Among the cabinet members currently holding the most important positions in the Japanese cabinet, besides the two ministers of the Army and Navy, are the Ministers of Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and Finance. Kido, the Home Minister of the Hiranuma Cabinet, although said to be an old acquaintance of the Konoe Cabinet, is inferior to the indecisive Moto in terms of his decisiveness and backing. When he took office and made his opening remarks, he immediately declared the abandonment of the New Party movement, namely the National Reorganization movement, that he had previously been active in. His greatest role is only to mitigate the elder statesmen's hatred of Hiranuma. If Finance Minister Ishiwata is compared to Ikeda, he is simply a small sorcerer compared to a great one. He not only cannot represent the will of the financial world, but also handles the financial world clumsily. His financial policies are actually repeating the mistakes of Kaya. The tax increase policy that Ikeda did not adopt, Kaya is going to adopt on a large scale, turning a blind eye to the heavy burden on the Japanese people, especially the rural villages. We really don't know how this "financial artist" can avoid stumbling. Speaking of Foreign Minister Arita, his character is certainly the same as before, but the increasingly deteriorating environment has made the same person's mind even more confused. Furthermore, the newly appointed Minister of Agriculture Sakurai Takeo, Minister of Railways Maeda Yonezō, and Minister of Health Hirose are even more insignificant. Sakurai (of the Minseitō party) and Maeda (of the Seiyūkai party) are merely decorations of the political parties in the cabinet. As long as the name of Japanese parliamentary politics exists, one or two members of political parties must always be inserted in the Japanese cabinet. Their position as mere hangers-on has long been despised by Machida, the president of the Minseitō party. It is also conceivable that they cannot play any role between the cabinet and the political parties. As for Hirose, the Minister of Health, he is merely a side branch of Home Minister Kido. Initially, the Hiranuma cabinet had decided that Kido would concurrently hold the positions of Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of Health. However, Kido's response on the phone was: "Concurrent duties are too burdensome, I really can't handle it. Please appoint Hirose, a bureaucrat, as Minister of Health." Hirose's role can also be imagined. The other cabinet members are all Konoe's "old people in old positions," so there is no need to elaborate.

The Objective Situation of the Hiranuma Cabinet

From the day it was born, the Hiranuma Cabinet, which had a third-stage tuberculosis, the biggest difficulty is still the harsh objective situation. Although the average Japanese person does not usually see Hiranuma as ordinary, most recognize Hiranuma as "an innovative politician who feels it is necessary to thoroughly reform the political, economic, and even educational systems for the rise of the Japanese Empire" (see "Today's Problems"). Therefore, there are still many people who expect the Hiranuma Cabinet to materialize, but today's environment is very different from the past. Whether Hiranuma's usual aspirations can be carried out at this time is a huge question. Discussing the "innovative political" ideology, Konoe's enthusiasm is certainly more intense than Hiranuma's. Konoe usually chanted his "innovation theory" as a noble, and after July of the previous year, he still did not forget about the revision of the House of Representatives election law, the reform of the House of Peers system, and even the revision of the universal civil service system. But what was the result? Everything remained the same. Even the New Party movement or the National Reorganization movement only became empty slogans. Although Konoe spent a lot of energy supporting the difficult situation for a year and a half, the result was only the titles of "Indecisive Courtyard" and "Mr. Conflict-Avoider" (as said by Lai Xian). Konoe's intelligence is actually higher than Hiranuma's. Before his resignation, he had made a major effort to explore the situation. He saw clearly that the domestic and international situations in Japan and the internal contradictions of the cabinet were not easy to overcome, so regardless of the elders, statesmen, and various parties' appeals to stay, he resolutely took the step of resigning, only agreeing to take on the idle position of Minister without Portfolio. Hiranuma took on the increasingly deteriorating situation at home and abroad in a hurry. It can almost be said that Hiranuma fully inherited the dregs of Konoe's cabinet members and the more intensified crisis. Even if he had three heads and six arms, it would be difficult to reverse the decline, let alone Hiranuma is also an extremely mediocre person. Currently, the most serious and most difficult problems in Japan are how to quickly end the Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese war of aggression against China has been going on for nearly twenty months. The casualties of the army alone have reached more than 700,000. The mobilization of the army has reached the reserve army and the reserve army. The issue of troop types has actually been put on the agenda of the Japanese Diet. The consumption of material and financial resources is even greater. The source of Japanese finance has now been exhausted. This year's budget案 was particularly difficult to produce. In peacetime, it would have been basically prepared in July of the first year, and the final decision would have been required in February, but this year it has been delayed until now and has not yet been fully decided. The biggest reason is that the subsequent war expenses, namely the so-called special military budget, are difficult to determine. According to recent news, the total amount of the Japanese Army and Navy's temporary additional budget for this year (this item may be the special military budget) has reached 5.97 billion yen. This is 1.12 billion yen more than the total amount of the Army and Navy's temporary additional budget案 for last year, which was 4.85 billion yen. This amount was already considerable, but the expansion of subsequent military operations will make the actual use much greater than this number, and the source of this budget must rely on public debt (5.29 billion yen) and tax increases (纳 680 million yen), both of which are uncertain futures. In July, we will also need to prepare the budget案 for the next year. I don't know how the old man Hiranuma will deal with it.

The Application of Policies Has Reached a Dead End

Japan's policy towards China has been chaotic and has reached a stage where it cannot but be chaotic. As Seiyūkai Diet member Sekō Kōichi pointed out in this Diet session, Japan's "non-intervention policy towards China" is constantly changing. Recently, foreign news has reported that "The Japanese government has now taken a completely unexpected step to make peace with China. Japan has suggested to the Chinese side to organize a new government with Chairman Chiang as a senior official..." This is certainly Japan's deception and enticement, but the wavering of its policy towards China can be asserted. Japan's use of political offensives has almost completely failed. The issue of plagiarizing the Three Principles of the People and using cultural aggression has even been put on the agenda of the Japanese Diet. Its policy's having reached a dead end has been completely exposed, which is also the Hiranuma Cabinet's fatal wound. The second major difficulty facing the Japanese government is the problem of "friendly diplomacy," which is closely related to the war of aggression against China. The Japanese aggressors, who pride themselves on being a "super race" (as said by the former Japanese spy, the Italian Fan Si Pai), although dreaming of conquering China, Asia, and even the world, still need to reconcile their diplomatic relations with various countries due to environmental constraints. This responsibility was initially placed on Hirota's shoulders, but the result was that the more he tried to coordinate, the more uncoordinated he became. His successor, Utagaki, also ended up in a complete failure and fled in panic. Arita exposed his diplomatic incompetence in the Konoe Cabinet, and his current situation is a hundred times more difficult. Although the joint sanctions method of Britain, the United States, and France has not been fully launched, the recent tough stance and various measures of the bears have also given Foreign Minister Arita a headache. In addition, the development of the Soviet-Japanese fishing dispute in March and April will make Arita even more helpless than Utagaki. The Japanese army has neither the strength nor the determination to fight the Soviet Union, and the result will still be to submit to the Soviet Union, but the government must bear the blame for the responsibility.

Eager to End its War Against China

The Japanese military's recent response in the Diet has clearly revealed its weakness towards the Soviet Union. At the Berlin German-Italian-Japanese military-diplomatic joint conference, Germany and Italy also asked Japan to attack Britain, the United States, and France at the same time. The naval faction emphasized the thorough "punishment" of China for the sake of achievements and insisted on strengthening naval equipment. As a result, they brazenly occupied Hainan Island, one of Japan's two iron fists in the Pacific, creating the "September 18th Incident in the Pacific" and destroying the balance of power in the Pacific among Britain, the United States, France, and Japan. It is conceivable how the diplomatic relations between Japan and Britain, the United States, and France will become even more entangled after this. Due to the deterioration of international relations and the failure to end the war against China, the internal disputes caused by it, therefore, various internal contradictions are also the current major crisis of the Hiranuma Cabinet. The Hiranuma Cabinet, "the least popular in Japanese history," is indeed at a loss as to what to do with these contradictions. Hiranuma, who usually had grand dreams of greatly reforming Japan's political, economic, and educational systems, has also declared that the Hiranuma Cabinet will take the Konoe Cabinet's policy as its policy. However, as the Japanese commentator said, the Konoe Cabinet is an "Indecisive Courtyard," and Konoe is "Mr. Conflict-Avoider," then the trend of Hiranuma's domestic policy is completely known. Now, it is already afraid to mention the issue of the New Party movement of national reorganization. In the future, the long-pending issues of electoral system reform, House of Peers system reform, and even civil service system reform will not be dared to be touched. In this way, the future of Japan's political further fascistization, which Hiranuma subjectively desires, will not be able to advance a step, and the Hiranuma Cabinet will appear even more fragile. As for other issues such as material mobilization, spiritual mobilization, and various issues under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, all of which are closely related to the war of aggression against China, it is impossible to solve them satisfactorily in the near future. Now, for a larger war, it is not only the elder statesmen and senior officials who hold a cautious attitude, but also the upper financial circles who advocate a non-expansionist doctrine. Even among the military, there are people who advocate "knowing when to stop." Hiranuma's situation in the future is really very difficult: should he run wild with the young military officers? Japan's national strength really does not allow it, and most Japanese people outside the military閥 are also unlikely to agree. Should he implement his so-called "friendly policy"? The internal and external situation does not allow him to smoothly display his skills, let alone he has no skills at all. Such a weak cabinet, a "nominal" cabinet, will either be reorganized or resign en masse in the near future. No wonder Kohno asked Hiranuma: "Expeditiously reorganize the cabinet and recruit new people," and Hiranuma could only respond with a wry smile.

### Zhou Enlai Inspects Eastern Battlefield, Deploys Zhejiang Eastern Defenses

Thorough Deployment Along Both Sides of the Yangtze River

Reinforcement Troops Begin General Offensive

Japanese Motorboats Head South, Attempting to Land Again

Zhou Enlai, Deputy Minister of the Political Department of the National Government's Military Commission, was ordered to inspect the Eastern Battlefield. Due to the tense situation in Eastern Zhejiang, he advanced his inspection of various locations in Eastern Zhejiang. Together with Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the ×th War Zone, and Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, he held a military conference in a certain location in Eastern Zhejiang, and instructed on the coastal and river defenses of Eastern Zhejiang. It is reported that it was stipulated that the area along the Qiantang River would be the responsibility of Huang Shaoxiong's troops, and the area along the Fuchun River would be the responsibility of Liu Jianxu, Commander-in-Chief of the ×th Army Group, as ordered by Gu Zhutong. Now all deployments have been completed, are exceptionally solid, and martial law has been implemented.

Reinforcement Troops Arrive at Destination

The Japanese troops who secretly crossed the Fuchun River and landed have retreated to Lingjiaqiao and other places after being severely attacked by the garrison. A certain reinforcement unit dispatched by the ×th Army Group has arrived at its designated destination and is launching a general offensive against the Japanese troops. According to a traveler from Zhaojiacun, Fuyang County, across the Fuchun River, who came to Shanghai yesterday, the area belongs to the war zone and is garrisoned by a large army. All residents must have a certificate marked on their chest. The Japanese troops who secretly crossed the Fuchun River this time are only seven li away from Zhaojiacun.

One Hundred Japanese Motorboats Head South from Shanghai

The Ta Lu Pao reported that a foreign ship captain arrived in Shanghai last night (24th) and said that he had seen one hundred Japanese motorboats speeding south from Wusong towards Hangzhou Bay. It is estimated that the Japanese troops will attempt to land on the coast of Zhejiang Province. The type of motorboat is used by the Japanese Marine Corps. According to people from Ningbo, Japanese warships bombarded the Zhenhai Fort again on Thursday morning, and the defending troops also returned fire. The Japanese troops did not attempt to land. It is reported that the Izumo warship was among the Japanese warships that continuously bombarded the area.

Furthermore, a Japanese warship was discovered on the Xizawa waters of Xiangshan Port, seemingly passing by. It is reported that the number of Japanese warships in the waters of Eastern Zhejiang has increased to more than ten.

Shipping in Eastern Zhejiang Vigorously Maintained

In recent days, the coast of Eastern Zhejiang has been repeatedly harassed by Japanese warships, which has led to frequent threats of disruption to the shipping traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang. According to inquiries from the shipping industry, our military defenses in Eastern Zhejiang are extremely solid. At the same time, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places have significant implications for Shanghai's transportation of goods and materials, and are greatly related to the economic life of the people. Therefore, within the realm of possibility, we must strive to maintain transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang. However, the ban on strong men accompanying the ships from Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places is stricter than before. Women and the elderly can purchase tickets and accompany the ships after obtaining an export permit from the county government. Yesterday, the Far East Company's Hana輪 departed from Ningbo, transited to Dinghai, and sailed to Shanghai, arriving at the port this morning. There were still many passengers, and the goods and local products loaded were also very prosperous. The ship is scheduled to sail straight to Ningbo at 4:00 PM this afternoon. The Zhongyi Company's Deping 輪 and the Huamei Company's Tangsai 輪 are both scheduled to depart for Ningbo on the 27th. The Meili Company's Meida 輪 and the Huamei Company's Tangbei 輪 are scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Wenzhou on the 27th and 28th, respectively. Passenger tickets have been sold at the respective companies, and cargo loading is being arranged.

### Japanese Silk Factory in Wuxi Torched by Guerrillas

Wuxi Correspondence: Wuxi is a region with a developed silk industry. Since its fall, the Japanese have monopolized the county's silk industry and formed the Huiming Company, merging the original Zhenyi, Anyu, Hefeng, and other silk factories. In just a few months last year, the company made a huge profit of more than two million yuan, all of which was plundered from the blood and sweat of silkworm farmers. Yu, the leader of the 3rd Brigade of the 10th Detachment of the Righteous Army in the county, led his troops to surround the Zhenyi Silk Factory, located at Yangyaowan outside the South Gate, and set it on fire in the early morning of the 23rd. For a time, the raging fire filled the sky. The guerrillas retreated after completing their mission. By the time the Japanese troops learned of the incident and rushed to the scene, they had cut off traffic and carried out searches of pedestrians, but found nothing.

### Owner of Jiaxing Theater Shot and Killed by Patriots

Jiaxing Correspondence: Guerrillas are quite active in Jiaxing City. The Wangwu Bridge area is a place where Japanese merchants gather, and Japanese shops are lined up, but there are even more Chinese slogans posted. Wei Jüzhen, the owner of the Jiyuan Theater inside the North Gate, relied on the support of the Japanese when they occupied Jiaxing and staged so-called Sino-Japanese friendship dramas to numb the Chinese people. At about 10:00 PM last night, Wei was returning home from the theater when two young patriots wearing black clothes suddenly jumped out at the entrance of Zhangjia Lane and fired fiercely at Wei. Wei immediately fell to the ground in extreme pain and soon died. The puppet police rushed to the scene after hearing the gunshots, but the murderers had already escaped. Wei was hit by four bullets, two in the chest, one in the right arm, and one in the head. After the case occurred, all the Japanese troops were dispatched to carry out a large search of shops and residences in the area around the Hai'er Bridge and Pusa Bridge, but found nothing.

### Finance: Gold Shops Continue to Buy, Cash Price Rises Only Slightly

Daily Fluctuation Range Extremely Narrow

Transactions Also Extremely Scarce

Yesterday, the cash 烚赤 (roasted raw gold) market was quiet and dull, with no highlights. Transactions were also mediocre and uninteresting. The price was quite stable due to securities firms and gold shops buying, hovering between 2,080 yuan and 82 yuan throughout the day. As a result, it continued to rise by 3 yuan and 5 jiao. People's minds were calm, and transactions were not active, with a total of about 350 taels in the morning and afternoon. Silver shop jewelry gold remained unchanged, and customs gold and Sino-British pure gold also remained stable.

### Roasted Raw Gold Market Quiet

Since the morning, because news said that the foreign exchange momentum was slightly soft, sellers were quite rare, so it took a long time to open. Until 10:05, the first transaction was seen when a money exchange firm entered 50 taels of cash gold at 2,085 yuan, which was 3 yuan and 5 jiao higher than the previous day's closing price. It was heard that a securities firm entered 50 taels of gold at 84 yuan. Subsequently, money exchange firms also mutually traded 50 taels at the same price. After this, supply and demand became scarce, and the price rarely changed. Around 11:00, because the foreign exchange situation turned flat, the sellers' willingness to supply was slightly stronger, but the buyers were all watching from the sidelines at that time, so the price slightly weakened. A silver shop gave a money exchange firm 50 taels at 82 yuan. It was already 11:20. After this, the general members left early because there was no supply and demand, so the afternoon closing price was still 82 yuan. The afternoon opening was still quiet. Around 2:30, a certain gold shop suddenly had a buying mood, and the price repeated its upward trend. It first entered 50 taels with a money exchange firm at 82 yuan, then entered 50 taels of cash with a gold shop at 83 yuan, and then entered 50 taels with a money exchange firm at 85 yuan. After this, it still wanted to buy, but the sellers had to supply at 87 yuan, so it was difficult to open. Therefore, the evening closing price was 2,085 yuan, which was 3 yuan and 5 jiao higher than the previous closing price. The whole day was only a 3-yuan difference. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand gold was 2,095 yuan, and the buying price was 2,085 yuan.

### Securities: Bulls Habitually Spread Rumors; Government Bonds' Rise is Fleeting

If the government wants to buy government bonds,

Will it issue a large amount of banknotes?

Securities Market Intelligence: Yesterday's market conditions were such that, because the European situation seemed to be coming to an end, and the new regulations on collecting banknotes, as reported by this newspaper earlier, had also been confirmed, the market sentiment, which had been weak for several days, immediately rebounded. This was within the expectations of this newspaper. However, because it was Saturday, and because of profit-taking by speculators and the upcoming weekend holiday, the bullish side was not very enthusiastic, and the market's sharp rise stabilized quickly. There should be further changes next week. Yesterday, the market opened half a yuan higher in the morning. Tiansheng, Lianhe, Hengfu, and retail investors all absorbed the bonds. Tongkang continued to sell. Tongshun, Shunheng, Guangfeng, and Yongjun all released bonds. Thirty-eighth also secretly sold. However, because of strong absorption by retail investors, the market price rose by 57 cents in the morning. In the afternoon, retail investors continued to buy. Maoyi and Shuifeng also bought actively, and the market price continued to rise slightly. Then, due to selling by speculators, Tongkang and Thirty-fifth both sold, and the trend was slightly frustrated. In the end, the price generally rebounded by 45 to 60 cents. There were no transactions in the afternoon. The total volume was about 600,000 yuan. As for the rumor that a certain place was buying bonds, it is ridiculous. The government is issuing government bonds, why would it absorb them? If the government buys government bonds, banknotes will inevitably flow out, and the result will inevitably be an increase in the monetary supply. It is unlikely that the government would take such a step. Therefore, it is clear that the bulls are using newspapers to spread rumors to deceive the ignorant. A brief table is listed below:

Category	 	Highest	 	Lowest	 	Closing	 	Compared to Previous Day

Unified A		570	 	5765	 	5765	 	Up 0.45

Unified B		5190	 	5150	 	5170	 	Up 0.50

Unified C		5170	 	5120	 	5135	 	Up 0.55

Unified D		5030	 	5020	 	5030	 	Up 0.65

### Grain: Foreign Flour Pours In; Local Flour Offerings Loosen Again; Factories Prepare Bags to Load Wheat

The spot market for flour is weakening again. It is found that local demand was not very active due to the weekend. After the Beiyang group offered a special price for a batch, there were no consecutive full-batch transactions. The Nanyang group also temporarily had no full-volume transactions due to unsuccessful price negotiations. Furthermore, it is said that a new ship of American "Flag" brand flour has arrived, and brands such as Jinma and Shuangying are standard No. 2 foreign flour, which is being sold in the market. It is said that the spot price is only 4.3 to 4.28 yuan, and some of the clients have also shifted to foreign flour. Yesterday, it was heard that several thousand bags had been traded in Qinhuangdao and other places in the Beiyang area. The local flour market has been greatly impacted, so it is said that the No. 2 flour factory's offering has fallen from 4.6 yuan to 4.55 yuan. If there is a large demand, the special price of 4.5 yuan can still be negotiated, but it has not been officially announced on the surface, and will be waited for at the beginning of the week. It is found that 66,500 bags of flour have been exported to Tianjin, and another 11,000 bags have been exported to Shantou.

The wheat market has also turned into a stable and secretly loose situation. Due to the recent dumping of foreign flour, the local flour market price has repeatedly declined slightly, and the raw material market is inevitably affected. However, at the moment when local wheat arrivals and inventories are both scarce, the street has no special major impact. Yesterday, it was heard that the Fuxin and Fufeng factories purchased 210,000 sacks to prepare for loading wheat. It is said that loose cargo of foreign wheat will arrive soon, and some say they are preparing for the new wheat season. As for local wheat trading, it is again at a standstill.

### Japonica and Indica Rice Market Continues to be Small; Foreign Rice Falls in Price and Sales Increase

As for the source of japonica rice, a total of 1,000 to 2,000 bags of "Car Comes Bag" rice arrived at the river docks. The local streets and hoarding households initially had some activity in the sales market, but in the end, due to strict price limits, people's hearts turned weak and suddenly became stagnant. Most of the goods could not be opened up, and it was difficult for the market to stand on its own feet, showing a downward trend. As a result, the price of thick and thin japonica rice fell by 10 to 20 cents, and Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian followed suit by a similar amount. The price of Luan Yuan rice was high, and the source of Yin Yuan rice gradually increased, so sales became sluggish and the price dropped by 30 cents, while Yin Yuan rice depreciated slightly by 10 cents. 客秈 traders continued to sell off, but the local street digestion was very sluggish, and the market continued to be small by 10 to 20 cents. Gao Wu 秈 rice had a price of 12.7 yuan, while medium grade rice ranged from 12.45 yuan to 12 yuan. However, after the price fell, both local retailers and the Nanyang group purchased some, and the market has been stabilized. The total market transaction was still less than 3,000 bags.

The number one Saigon, has insisted on above 17 yuan for several days, but the transaction has decreased. Due to the decline in the selling price of various 秈 rices by the clients, for example, Nanjing 蕪芜湖秈 has gradually fallen from the highest price of more than 13.5 yuan to 12.78 yuan, while the decline in foreign rice is very small, which is why importers are watching. Yesterday, the market price once reached 16.8 yuan including fees for disposal, and retail sales were slightly more active. As for the Department of Works' short-weighted original bags, 2,000 bags were also sold in batches, it is said.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Sales Are Not Very Prosperous; Spot and Warehouse Receipts Are Close; Price Difference is Only One Yuan

The yarn market continues to decline, and the downtrend has not stopped. Because the goods in the hands of general importers, seeing the bad environment, and the goods accumulated in the financial community, are also trying to sell off, the market atmosphere is becoming increasingly lazy. At the same time, the actual needs of the clients are still stagnant and uninspired. As a result, the market outlook is even more scattered and weak. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 381 yuan. Subsequently, due to fear in people's hearts, it was sold down to the 380 yuan mark, with the lowest price being 377 yuan. However, in the past two days, it has fallen sharply by more than 10 yuan. Zhejiang East is still peaceful, and the Wenzhou-Taizhou clients' yarn and thread are still being shipped as usual. What the future holds depends on the amount of actual needs. The situation stabilized slightly in the afternoon, but business was still sluggish.

As for the situation of spot yarn, at the beginning of the morning, colleagues gathered together to watch and were lifeless. It was not until 10:15 AM that the market price slightly opened. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma warehouse receipt was 380 yuan, which was imported by a colleague with 75 bales. Subsequently, because the business of the clients was still not active, and the sellers were concentrated in the market, the asking price gradually declined. The initial price of the spot was 381 yuan, and the lowest price was 377 yuan. This opening price was down by 4 yuan. However, the price of the warehouse receipt was slightly higher, at 376 yuan, only one yuan apart. Because the sales of spot goods are lacking, and the Guang Fang催 out, if not turned over to the East, it must be sold at the market price. The warehouse receipt still has time to slow down. The opening was flat in the afternoon, but market transactions were still rare. It is found that the total amount sold by various clients throughout the day was 1,125 bales, and the market price was 20 wens per piece. The yarn price was 比上日 四五, Tiannv fell by 3.5 yuan, and Te Jin Cheng fell by 4 yuan. The factory opened 150 bales of 10-count Feihu yarn from the Anda Factory at a price of 290 yuan. Today, 510 pieces of yarn were shipped to Shantou, 100 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 190 pieces were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 8615 pieces were shipped to Haiphong. The amount purchased by various clients is listed on the left:

Colleagues	525	Wenzhou	40

Fujian	80	Shantou	140

Inland	160	Yunnan	175

Quanzhou	5	Statistics	1,125

The Japanese yarn market is still lifeless, and actual sales are still sluggish. However, the situation for the next month is relatively high, because the major players are all in a bullish position. The spot yarn price of 20-count Shuiyue is 339 yuan, and the spot yarn price of 20-count Lanfeng is usually around 330 yuan, which is about the same as the previous day.

As for the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market is very weak. Southern merchants are selling off fiercely. The Cotton Committee of the US Department of Agriculture will hold a meeting next week to discuss Smith's proposal and the issue of subsidies for cotton export loans.

Hongzhang entered 300 bales of Bai Luoqu. Other factories had no transactions. Japanese factories have not opened for purchase for many days.

As for the source of Northern Jiangsu, a total of 432 bales of Tongzhou flowers were counted. The current situation of spot cotton is listed below:

### Miscellaneous Grains: Foreign Merchants' Raw Peanuts; Price of Qingdao Products is Limited

"12.8 Yuan... Only Allowed to Fall, Not Allowed to Rise"

Qingdao Communication: The raw peanuts there have been rising continuously, and have been noticed by foreign merchants. Therefore, the "Exchange" has imposed restrictions on them, and it has been resolved that 12.8 yuan is the highest price, and no further increase is allowed. It is also stipulated that the price must be depreciated by 20 cents per week. If any private collection with price increase is found, it will be severely cracked down, it is said. If so, the current situation is that only declines are allowed and no rises are allowed. Therefore, the trend is stagnant. Foreign merchants sold 3,000 bags of raw peanuts at 12.8 yuan to foreign merchants and oil workshops. 1,400 bags of large-grain peanuts were sold for 13.6 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Lun Chang Linen; Consigned Empty by Local Street Daily

"Eastern Piece Goods Directly Shipped and Sold to Guerilla Areas"

The market price of domestic plain cloth continued to weaken, because Hua yarn fell sharply, and actual sales by Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants were affected by the military situation, and suddenly became bleak. Furthermore, the Shanghai-Ningbo exchange rate recently surged to 1,062 yuan, making it even more difficult to remit funds from both sides. However, although Hua yarn fell, Japanese yarn still stood firm. The cost of cloth did not decrease, and the selling price of Japanese cloth was firm. The decline of Zheng Tuan cloth was also缓和, with each piece continuing to fall by 5 cents. The most vibrant actual sales were in the local street and Guangdong gangs. Retail wholesale shops in the local street consigned a large number of fixed orders from various factories in the city daily. New amounts of poplin, printed goods, and various grey cloth were also purchased one after another. Lun Chang printed non-fading floral cloth, linen was shipped out daily, all being divided up by major cloth shops in the local street.

In order to deal with the domestic cloth registration, the Min gang has temporarily banned the import of domestic cloth. However, fabrics from the Yihua and Lun Chang factories, which are products of British merchants, are still allowed to be shipped.

The Eastern cloth market atmosphere is firm and high. Because the dyeing and sales of thin twill are becoming more and more prosperous, there is a shortage of spot goods, and they continue to rise. In addition to raising the price of Longtou twill by 10 cents per piece, Jiangshang 洋行 opened next month's futures of Longtou thin twill at 12.05 yuan, and Wufu thin twill at 11.9 yuan, but the amount was not large, only 100 plus loads. Local street and Qingdao gangs purchased about 800 plus pieces of thin cloth and thin twill. The stock in hand by the same industry is very thin at the moment, and Japanese merchants are tightening the market, and it is heard that they are directly shipping and selling to guerilla areas, so the local goods base in Shanghai is gradually decreasing, and people's hearts are firmer.

Yesterday's market price for Bai Yu flat almonds rose by 50 yuan to 250 yuan. Long Wang flat almonds rose by 30-40 yuan, selling for 200 yuan. 　Apricots are also asking for the same price. It is found that the total market inventory is only dozens of loads.

### Hardware: Inventory of New Lead Wire is Extremely Low

For example, numbers 22 to 25 sell for 26 yuan, a single number 25 can sell for around 30 yuan, and Zu Hua Se opens at 23 yuan.

As a result, it was consistently轧升 by 10 to 20 cents. It is estimated that 50 pieces of Kai Yanqi oil were properly opened (price details in market price　), 90 pieces of Lianqi oil, and 80 pieces of 六. 100 plus barrels of spot Dalian oil, 500 barrels for delivery in April, and 200 barrels for delivery in May.

### Fengyang Maru Sunk by Chinese Army En Route to Hankou

"The ship was full of food and fodder

Losses exceeded one million yuan"

Xiandai News Agency reports that, according to news from foreign shipping circles, the Japanese Nissin Company's Yangtze River liner Fengyang Maru, with a deadweight of more than 1,000 tons, was requisitioned by the Japanese military authorities and converted into a transport ship for transporting military supplies and food.

Two bombs hit its head, destroying the front half, and the whole ship immediately flooded and sank quickly. None of the personnel on board were rescued. The Daji Maru sped to Hankou and escaped safely. The Japanese warship was also unharmed. In addition to Japanese personnel, the Fengyang Maru's sailors, drivers, stokers, etc., were all Chinese. Their families in Shanghai have all been informed of the disaster and are negotiating with the person in charge of recruiting these Chinese workers in the hope of obtaining compensation.

### Japanese Shipping Company Pier and Warehouse Consumed by Fire

Estimated Losses of 200,000 to 300,000 Yuan

Japanese Consulate Buildings Also Heavily Damaged

Japanese Authorities Still Investigating the Cause of the Fire

According to the Continental News, the wharf warehouse of the Japanese shipping company on Huangpu Road caught fire last night (the 24th). The buildings of the police station of the Japanese Consulate General were destroyed, and some important buildings of the consulate were also damaged. This is the largest fire seen since the great fire of 1937.

The fire started at 11:20 p.m. and the flames raged until 2:30 a.m. this morning. A large amount of cotton, wood, and other flammable goods stored in the warehouse were completely consumed by the fire. As of the time the Continental News went to print, the extent of the damage to the consulate buildings was not yet certain, but it is estimated that the losses are quite significant. Nine fire engines from the Public Concession Fire Brigade were dispatched to put out the fire, and the Japanese side also urgently dispatched four fire engines to the scene to assist in controlling the fire. A fireboat was also moored alongside in the river. Shortly after midnight, heavy snow began to fall. At the time, the Japanese authorities opened the doors of the consulate's prison cells and evacuated about sixty prisoners.

To Hongkou

Other buildings. Shortly before midnight, as the flames were raging, the scene was set in motion. Japanese troops, including Japanese naval and army soldiers, suddenly arrived in the area, entering the consulate buildings, carrying out official documents and ledgers. There was also a truck carrying forty barrels of gasoline stored in the consulate buildings, which were transported to a safe place. A Japanese shipping vessel of the Japanese shipping company happened to be berthed in front of the wharf directly opposite the burning warehouse. Because the flames were so long, it had to lift anchor and sail elsewhere. A patrolman of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces first saw the fire at 11:20 and immediately sounded the alarm. Although there was light rain, the fire was not affected at all. The Public Concession Fire Brigade arrived on the scene a few minutes later, but the flames had already spread rapidly inside this stele wall wood frame warehouse. Shortly after midnight, the wind became strong, hindering the work of the firefighters. At nearly 1:00 a.m., about twenty fire hydrants had gradually brought the fire under control. After midnight, a large number of Jewish refugees returning to their residences in Huishan and some curious residents

Gathered to Watch the Fire

Reached 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Japanese Consul General Miura and the police chief of the consulate also arrived on the scene to direct the personnel of the consulate. A moment after 1:10, Japanese Consul Sato moved the photographs of the Japanese Emperor and Empress from the Consulate General to the Japanese Central Elementary School on Bazilu. The Japanese authorities are currently investigating whether the fire was caused by arson. Also, a report in the North China Daily News stated that at 1:30 this morning, the post office of the Japanese shipping company also caught fire and burned. The wind caused the flames to extend to the riverside. Firefighters tried their best to protect

The Japanese Consulate

The houses. The ships in front of the nearby wharves were untied and moved elsewhere to avoid being affected. The fireboat was moored alongside to deal with any fires that might be caused by flying sparks. The house may collapse on Wuchang Road and the Yushun Wharf. This seems to be the main danger. The fire in the consulate was quickly extinguished, but as the North China Daily News was about to go to press, a fire broke out again in the consulate. The firefighters tried their best to save it. At 1:30, the huge cracking sound of tiles continuing to collapse was still heard along the Bund. Also, the English Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that as of the time the Greater Shanghai Evening Post went to press, two fireboats and two fire engines were still watering the embers of the Japanese shipping company's warehouse and part of the company's office next to the Japanese Consulate General. Inside the smoky rubble pile

Explosions Occurred

Because there were bottled beers in the warehouse that exploded due to heat. Firefighters were very careful when watering because there was a risk of bricks falling down. The warehouse walls will inevitably collapse and must be completely rebuilt.

### "Anti-Japanese National Reconstruction Association" Establishes National Reconstruction Army, Declares Recruitment of Patriotic Volunteers from Occupied Areas with Guerrilla Warfare as the Highest Task

According to a visitor from a certain place yesterday, since the central government decided on a long-term war of resistance and launched guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas, many patriotic volunteers in the occupied areas have spontaneously armed themselves and joined the anti-Japanese front. For example, the Anti-Japanese National Reconstruction Association recently established the National Anti-Japanese National Reconstruction Army in a certain place, and its strength is extremely strong. The visitor also brought a copy of the declaration, which is recorded as follows:

Since the July 7th Incident, the Japanese warlords have invaded westward in full force. The Chinese nation, with heroic posture, rose up to resist. Bloody battles in Shanghai, the Xuzhou campaign, the Taierzhuang encirclement, and the Wuhan demonstration displayed the roar of the nation, inflicted heavy blows on the enemy, focused international attention, and advocated world justice. Our central government led the entire nation to fight for the country, for ten years, annihilating nearly a million enemies. Although in the first phase of the war, our army's key transportation points and lines had to be strategically abandoned after exacting a heavy price from the enemy, although our central government had to shift its focus westward due to factual demands, and although the local governments in the occupied areas had to adapt to local conditions due to environmental factors, the entire war of resistance military and determination have not only not been shaken in the slightest, but the arrangements for the occupied areas have become even more precise, and the widespread guerrilla warfare has been actively launched to coordinate with the frontal war of resistance, adhering to the belief that the war of resistance will surely be victorious, and initiating the foundation for the revival of the nation. However, enemy cavalry is rampant in the coastal provinces, and the central and local authorities in the occupied areas, both north and south, consider all aspects and take care of them, which is beyond discussion. Within the occupied areas, there are many patriotic volunteers and revolutionary masses who have risen up in arms and generously devoted themselves to the cause. Moreover, the supreme leader proclaimed to us that the victory of China's war of resistance lies in the blood of the people deep in the interior. The establishment of this association is the only alliance of revolutionary comrades in the occupied areas, adhering to the Three People's Principles as the highest principle of national reconstruction, and implementing the instructions of the supreme leader to mobilize the masses to arm themselves for the war of resistance. Therefore, the National Anti-Japanese National Reconstruction Army is established, with its headquarters in a certain place, to concentrate, train, and unify the organization of all the vast armed anti-Japanese forces, cultivate them into elite troops, and assist the national army in jointly destroying the powerful enemy. After the establishment of this army, arming the masses and guerrilla warfare will be the highest and supreme task, and the spirit of perseverance and sacrifice will be used to fight for the liberation of the nation, without fear, without retreat, without regard to merits, and without distinction of boundaries. All patriotic people and revolutionary fighters are sincerely welcomed by this army and are willing to join hands and move forward, enrich the anti-Japanese front, and bravely attack the enemy. All the established national policies of the central government and the measures of local governments are what this army is willing to abide by and accept. Moreover, this army is composed of armed masses, and it deeply feels and suffers all the pain of the people. It deeply resents the enemy's evil deeds. It is determined to uphold the friendship of defending the country and completely eliminate it. Following this bravely and without hesitation, until the enemy's army collapses and justice is served, then the mission borne by this army will be completed with the completion of the central government's national policy of resisting Japan and building the country. At the beginning of the army's establishment, I humbly state this, wishing to encourage the people of the country together.

### Japanese Side Deliberately Creates Difficulties: Dissatisfaction with the Municipal Council

Believing the Council is Protesting to the Diplomatic Body

With "Unfriendly" Procedures

Japanese Consul General Also Has a Protest Letter

According to the Continental News, when the Japanese side received reporters from various newspapers last night (the 24th), it issued a protest letter from the Japanese Consul General, stating that the Municipal Council's act of protesting to the diplomatic body was an "unfriendly" procedure. According to a certain member of the Municipal Council speaking to reporters last night, the incident of armed Chinese people other than those employed by the Municipal Council entering the Public Concession has always been submitted to the diplomatic body for consideration. The Council submitted a protest to the leader of the diplomatic body on Thursday

The protest was handled according to the old rules, and there was nothing unfriendly about the procedure, nor was there any unfriendly intention. The Japanese spokesperson mentioned the protest made by the Municipal Council, saying that if the Municipal Council intended to resolve this issue with a peaceful and friendly attitude, it should first negotiate with the Japanese Consul General, but the Council submitted the matter to the leader of the diplomatic body for handling. The Japanese side believes this

It is an unfriendly procedure. The Council submitted a protest to the leader of the diplomatic body, and the leader of the diplomatic body has not yet had the opportunity to discuss the matter with the Japanese authorities. The Municipal Council hastily announced the news. The Chairman of the Municipal Council visited the Japanese Consul General at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday. Why did he not mention this matter? It is quite puzzling. The spokesperson answered a reporter's question, stating that the diplomatic body has not yet lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities. When asked about the integrity of the Public Concession being violated, the Municipal Council should follow

The spokesperson replied that in such cases, they believe they should negotiate directly with the Japanese Consul General. A reporter asked a member of the Municipal Council last night if he also knew that the Municipal Council had published the news of sending a note to the leader of the diplomatic body. Why did the Japanese side raise objections alone? The member replied that he did not know, and said that he could not understand why the Japanese side could object, because the Japanese side had repeatedly decided to publish news, and the Municipal Council's actions did not violate any agreements or understandings.

### Thrift and Relief: Voluntary Donations

Relief Association Sends Out 6,000 Letters

The Thrift Relief Committee appealed to people from all walks of life to donate monthly amounts from savings in consumption to relieve refugees.

Chang-Xi Opera Holds a Grand Joint Performance

Chang-Xi Opera is a type of art that is enjoyed by both the refined and the popular.

It has specially invited seven Chang-Xi opera troupes performing in Shanghai, including Tianchan, Fuyuan, Ruyi, Chang-Xi, Tongle, and Leyuan Tianyun, to hold a joint grand performance.

Various Chang-Xi opera troupes also act as ticket agents.

A Donation of Two Cents Per Dan of Hardware

Since its establishment, the fundraising committee of the Refugee Relief Association's trade association group has actively promoted fundraising work in various trade associations, and its achievements have been remarkable. It is learned that the iron industry, hardware industry, steel bar and scrap iron industry, and copper and tin industry, after being promoted by the association, invited representatives from the four trade associations to discuss the methods of collecting refugee donations. They started collecting on the 21st. There are more than 300 merchants in the industry, all of whom comply. According to the person in charge of the association, he told reporters yesterday that according to regulations, two cents of national currency are collected per market dan, and the daily traffic is quite large, so the results will definitely be considerable.

Insufficient Funding for the Municipal Education and Training Institute

The Women and Children's Education and Training Institute of the Shanghai First Special District Municipal Relief Association held its first board meeting yesterday. Chairman Lin Kanghou delivered a speech, saying that in order to relieve distressed women and children, the association decided to reorganize the reception center at No. 1260 Xiaoshadu Road into a women and children's education and training institute, and has already organized a preparatory committee, appointing Zhou Bangjun, Chen Jicheng, Zhang Yiqing, and Zhu Qizhen as the heads of the preparatory committee.

Relief Association Runs a Rattan Workshop

Recently, in view of the decreasing donations and in order to enable refugees to support themselves in the future, various workshops have been established. The rattan industry is certainly needed by the society. Recently, technicians have been hired and various application materials have been purchased, and refugees have been selected to engage in work.

### Public Mao Salt Depleted: Huai Salt Floods the Shanghai Market

Initially Sold by Tongmao, then Managed by Longmao. The Huai Salt Production Area Falls, and the Japanese Seize Control

The New Voice News Agency reported that the sale of salt in the Shanghai concessions has always been exclusively handled by the Shanghai Concession Salt Public Depot (i.e., Public Mao). This salt was transported to Shanghai from Daishan and other places in eastern Zhejiang. After the war, the Chinese government banned the export of salt from Daishan and other places, so the salt in the Shanghai concessions relied entirely on the Public Mao salt depot's existing stock. Although the Public Mao Salt Depot contacted the Salt Affairs Bureau, requesting permission to transport Zhejiang salt to Shanghai for regulation, Zhejiang salt's transportation to Shanghai was practically difficult due to Shanghai being an occupied area and the coast being blockaded by Japanese warships. Now the salt stored in the Public Mao has been depleted. There is now a company called Tongyuan Salt Industry, which has always been engaged in the business of refined salt. After the war, "Tongmao" signed a sales contract with Tongyuan, claiming that it was responsible for supplying salt in the concessions. It is said that this salt is not produced in Zhejiang, but is actually salt from the Huai region. After the expiration of the "Tongmao" sales contract, it was changed to be sold by the so-called "Longmao Official Salt Depot," which opened yesterday, claiming that all salt for sale in the concessions would be supplied by the depot. If there are any private transport or sales, the depot will apply to the authorities for arrest. It is said that since the Huai salt production area fell, the Japanese have controlled the transport and sale of Huai salt, and the transport of Huai salt to Shanghai requires the permission of the Japanese side.

### Church Hospital Property Losses: 1.5 Million

All Destroyed by Japanese Bombing

Even Those Returned Suffered Heavy Losses

According to the Continental News, as a result of the Japanese military advance, many church organizations have been destroyed. In the past two weeks, three more church hospitals have been destroyed, one in Xi'an, one in Zhengzhou, and one in Pingjiang, all bombed and destroyed by Japanese aircraft. Including these three, the total number of church hospitals destroyed during this decisive battle has now reached fourteen, with another twelve damaged

Or Stolen Occupied Seven, Four More Forced to Close Since the Military Xinghou. According to a recent survey by the responsible party, foreign church medical work in China has been affected by the war, accounting for 14% of the total. The total number of church hospitals is 268, and the estimated loss of hospital property is about 1.5 million yuan. However, the survey indicates that the most important thing is that the result of arbitrarily attacking these organizations has affected the destructive impact on the humanitarian mission of neutral countries. Most of the hospitals occupied have been returned to their legitimate owners, but the damage found is huge. Among them, the equipment is either destroyed or stolen. The hospitals occupied include the Baptist Hospital in Yangzhou, the Shanghai Sanitarium in Shanghai, and the Shanghai Sanitarium Hospital, the Wilkinson Hospital in Suzhou, the Jiaxing Hospital in Huzhou, and the Three Hospitals in Songjiang. In addition to the three mentioned above, the hospitals destroyed

There are also the Nantong Christian Hospital, the Elizabeth Hospital and the Toko Memorial Hospital in Suzhou, and the Christian Hospital in Jiangyin. Those who have been stolen include the Puren Hospital in Wuxi, the Church Hospital in Changsha, and the Graham Hospital in Haizhou.

### Northern and Southern Puppets Sell Out the Nation: Travel to Japan to Flatter

"North China Visiting and Inspecting Group" Departed the Day Before Yesterday

Pseudo "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an Scheduled to Depart on the 28th

After the northern and southern puppet organizations, under the orchestration of the Japanese side, successively declared their "establishment," the clowns crowed and celebrated, displaying nothing but flattery to the "master" and selling out national interests, and even going to great lengths to plunder money and exploit the people.

Although the name of this trip is a visit, it is actually to contribute methods of controlling the North China economy and sell out all North China economic rights.

Shanghai Puppets Scheduled to Cross to the East

In order to actively carry out the conspiracy to destroy China, the Japanese side is not only implementing economic aggression, but also taking various vicious means, such as propagating the "New Order in East Asia" and forcing people to study Japanese, in order to anesthetize people's minds. Recently, it has also planned to change the major cities in the estimated territories into Japanese, so it has gathered the so-called "East Asia Metropolitan City Consultation Conference" and ordered the puppet mayors of various places to arrive in Tokyo before the end of March. It is learned that after receiving the "order," the "pseudo Mayor of Shanghai" Chuan Xiao'an has scheduled to depart from Shanghai for the east on the 28th of this month, in order to take the opportunity to flatter the Japanese government and perform his shameless masterpiece.

### Businesses Should Not Refuse to Accept Payments in One-Yuan Legal Tender

City Federation Sends Letter to Silver Trade Association, Requesting Members to Accept

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent letters to the Bank Association and the Money Trade Association yesterday, stating: "According to letters from the 2nd, 91st, 12th, 21st, 24th, 26th, and 35th District Branches of this Federation, members have reported that various banks and money shops in the city often refuse to accept one-yuan legal tender when merchants or citizens submit larger payments. As a result, before submitting payments, one-yuan legal tender must first be exchanged for five-yuan or ten-yuan legal tender, which is very inconvenient. Since one-yuan legal tender is also a circulating legal tender, it should not be refused in principle and in law. Therefore, we are writing to request that your association forward this letter to the bank and money trade associations, instructing all member banks and money shops to accept one-yuan legal tender in the future to facilitate industry and commerce. We would be most grateful." It has been found that the refusal of banks and money shops to accept one-yuan legal tender when making payments does indeed cause many inconveniences to the business community. Therefore, we are writing to request that your association forward this letter to all member banks and money shops, requesting them to be accommodating and accept one-yuan legal tender in the future to facilitate business payments, which would be a public convenience.

### Thief Calmly Exits Car, Leaving Stolen Goods Inside

Yesterday afternoon around 1:30 PM, a friend of the reporter was riding the No. 22 public bus of the French Concession. At that time, the passengers were very crowded. When the bus passed the station at the intersection of Rue Bourgeois and Rue des Soeurs, there were also many passengers waiting there. Suddenly, a person chased after a passenger who was about to board the bus, loudly accusing him of "stealing a wallet" and immediately pulled him down, demanding that he return it. At that time, a Chinese police officer happened to pass by and immediately came forward to inquire. However, the passenger's attitude was strong and he firmly denied it, willing to be searched. At that time, the bus door was closed and sped forward. Suddenly, the ticket seller found a yellow wallet on the footboard of the bus door. Then everyone realized that when the passenger was pulled off the bus, he knew he had been exposed, so he temporarily abandoned the stolen wallet inside the car. The ticket seller immediately announced that he would send the wallet to the company to be claimed by the owner. Recently, there have been many passengers on trams and buses, and they are of mixed quality. Thefts are often heard of. It is hoped that readers will be vigilant.

### Two Criminals Executed for Robbing Huge Sum of Military Funds

The remaining two criminals also sentenced to severe penalties

Liang Zuocheng, a division commander of the New Fourth Army from Guangdong, along with his fifteen-year-old son and three guards, was carrying 327,000 yuan in military funds in December of the year before last, passing through Qiaoxiang Village in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province. They were stopped by a large number of accomplices, dozens of them, led by the village's bandit leader Da Yuanlin, who had already been executed by firing squad, as well as Chen Youfa, Qiao Detai, Qiao Yikun, and Zhang Bingquan.

Last spring, Dai Hongfu (31 years old), Qiao Changjin (43 years old), Chen Heshang (32 years old), and Chen Bosheng (16 years old), all Jurong natives who were involved in the case, fled to Shanghai. Dai Hongfu went to the Xiqingchi bathhouse on Jiujiang Road to find a friend. He was recognized by bathhouse attendants Jia Shigen, Zhang Heshang, and Shen Zhigao, who informed Chinese Constable No. 122 and secretly reported to Hua Tantang Shang Wu of the Huishi Police Station. The four suspects, Dai Hongfu and others, were arrested, along with suspect Chen Qiaosheng, and sent to the First Special District Local Court. The police determined that Chen Qiaosheng was not involved and released him on bail. Jia, Zhang, and Shen, the bathhouse attendants, went to court and testified about what they witnessed in Qiaoxiang Village on the afternoon of the day Commander Liang and his group were killed. The court ordered them to be remanded in custody pending sentencing. Details of the case were published in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Dai Hongfu and Qiao Changjin to death for jointly committing robbery with intent to kill.

### Released Prisoners Form Gang, Extorting Money Under False Pretenses

Establish Headquarters at Da Hu Hotel, Police Arrest Nine Criminals and Send Them to Court

Currently, there is a group of bandits who formed a gang while serving time in prison for crimes committed in the past. After their release, the War of Resistance broke out, and these people took advantage of the opportunity to fraudulently obtain money from wealthy merchants under the guise of so-called "Youth Service Society" and "Iron-Blooded Youth Anti-Treason Group." If they failed to defraud, they resorted to robbery. These people not only manufactured various badges and receipts but also carried firearms and committed numerous crimes. After discovering their secrets, Hua Zong Detective Yun Aji, Detective Chen Yonggui, Detective Gao Yong'an, and Detective Shan Zhaoxian of the Laoza Police Station learned that their meeting place was in rooms 205 and 304 of the Da Hu Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. They then coordinated with Western detectives and French police officers to go and arrest them. They arrested as many as 30 male and female criminals in the rooms and seized badges, receipt books of the Iron-Blooded Youth Anti-Treason Group, and seals of the Youth Service Society. Later, at number 282 Caishi Road in the French Concession, they seized a pistol and four bullets, and a fake pistol. After a detailed investigation, it was learned that of the people arrested, only Huang Xin, Huang Chuanwen, Liu Fuqiu, Hua Minxiang, Zhang Caiyi, Zhang Rongshang, Jiang Bofang, Fei Guishun, and Quan Huiquan were involved, while the rest were unrelated. The other 21 people were released. Yesterday morning, the nine people, including Huang, were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. The defendants jointly hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. The police lawyer Ru Bao Yi explained the process, stating that the investigation of the case was not yet complete, so he requested permission for temporary detention in order to prosecute after investigation. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered that all defendants be detained and rescheduled for further questioning.

Zhang Zhou, a woman from Tongzhou, who lived at No. 23, Lane 683, Gaojiazhai, Rue Say Zoong, had a five-year-old daughter named Di. At 11:45 AM on the 24th, Di was playing at the entrance of the lane when she was spotted by Wu Arong (20 years old, a painter from the local area). He lured her away with candy in an attempt to sell her for profit. However, Zhang Miaofa, a neighbor and fellow villager, saw Wu and thought his behavior was suspicious. He reported to Zhang Yaoxuan, the girl's father, and together they tracked Wu down to near the Gongda Yarn Factory on Singapore Road. Hua Constable No. 625 of the Ming Shan Police Station stopped Wu and brought him to the Gordon Road Police Station. The constable ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him for abduction under Article 241, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. He stated that the defendant had said at the police station that he had recently been gambling and losing money at the Shenji Casino in Caojiadu and could not make ends meet. After discussing it with a gambler, a certain Jia, who was at large, the two of them went to the place and abducted Zhang's daughter, intending to take her to an empty house and confine her. They first took off her clothes and earrings to pawn them and then try to sell the girl. He asked for a postponement of the case in order to arrest the accomplices. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the defendant and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation on another day.

### Son of an Old Servant of the Sheng Family Arrested for Attempting to Kidnap Young Master

Kidnapping Failed, Attempted Extortion

Old Servant Learned and Reported to the Police, Who Made the Arrest

Sheng Zecheng (also known as Lao Si), the manager of the Hanyeping Coal Mine Company, lives at No. 75 Yuyuan Road. His nine-year-old son, Yu Peng, attends the Western District Primary School of the Municipal Council at No. 48 Daxilu Road. Usually, every afternoon after school, his family sends a car, number 4444, to pick him up. This had become routine. However, at 3:15 PM on the 20th of this month, Chen Jindu, a native of Changzhou, accompanied by a young woman, arrived at the school gate in a chartered car, number 12182. Chen left the woman in the car and entered the school, telling the doorman of the school, number 2037, that he had come to pick up student Sheng Yu Peng, and that the person sitting in the car was Yu Peng's mother. The doorman did not believe him at first, but because he saw that Yu Peng knew Chen, he agreed to his request. Later, the doorman suspected that the woman in the car was too young to be Yu Peng's mother.

Suspicion arose and he questioned Chen, who became nervous and fled. He detained the woman and the car and reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, who sent Hua Detective Wu Chengmo to bring the people and the car to the police station for investigation. It was then learned that Chen Jindu was the son of Chen Fu, an old servant of the Sheng family. Chen Fu had been a servant in the Sheng family for 18 years. Chen Jindu often went to the Sheng family, so he knew Yu Peng. It was decided that Chen Jindu and a certain Jia would conspire to

Kidnap Yu Peng for ransom. They rented a room under the name of Shen Bujain at the Anshang Inn on Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession and hired a female guide, using the excuse of going to the theater, to lure her into the car to pretend to be a member of the Sheng family. The car was hired through the tea boy. Detective Wu learned of the situation and released the female guide and the driver. Until yesterday, Chen Fu suddenly received a phone call from his son Chen Jindu, agreeing to talk at the intersection of Avenue Haig and Hart Road. The Jing'an Temple Police Station, both Chinese and Western detectives, based on Chen Fu's report,

Secretly waited and watched until 3:00 PM when Chen arrived. They arrested him and seized four threatening letters from his person, also signed Shen Bujain. The general meaning was that because the kidnapping had failed, they had changed their plan and demanded 1,000 yuan in the letters. Then they went to the Huxi Hotel at Lane 568, Carter Road, and arrested accomplice Zhang Zhixiong (also known as Li Amai), a native of Tongzhou, and brought him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted them for extortion under Article 347, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, and detailed the above situation. He requested a postponement. Sheng Zecheng then complained that he did not know about the kidnapping of his son, but that Chen Jindu was the son of Chen Fu, and was usually a foreign coppersmith who had been unemployed since the war and was eating for free at his house, receiving two yuan a month. Chen Jindu confessed to the accusations. Zhang Zhixiong confessed that he was a beggar and was used by Chen, who asked him to write the letters, and that he did not know anything else. Judge Chuan reviewed the confessions and ordered the two defendants to be held for further questioning on April 3.

### Chinese Constable Embezzles Gold Bars

Chen Jinshan Carried Three Gold Bars to Shanghai to Exchange for Cash, Two Were Confiscated by the Chinese Constable Upon Landing, Original Stolen Goods Recovered, Ma Zongzhen Dismissed and Investigated

Chen Jinshan, a native of Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, 45 years old this year, recently invested in collecting scattered gold ornaments in his hometown and melted them into three gold bars, weighing 38 taels, 7 maces, and 5 fen, worth more than 8,000 yuan. A few days ago, he brought these gold bars from Jiangbei to Shanghai on the Taikoo Company's Wuxue wheel, intending to exchange them for cash at the Tongfengyong Gold Shop at No. 310 Nanjing Road in the Public Concession and then return to Jiangbei

to collect and sell gold ornaments. Unexpectedly, the Wuxue wheel arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM on the 23rd and docked at Taikoo Wharf No. 1 on the Bund in the French Concession. Chen then hid the gold bars on his body. While landing, Ma Zongzhen (nearly 40 years old, a native of Henan, a Muslim), Chinese Constable No. 412 of the Second Division of the French Concession's Mai Lan Police Station, along with Russian Constable No. 53, Chinese Constable, and Detective Cao, a female inspector, and others, were checking passengers arriving in Shanghai at the wharf when they discovered that Chen Jinshan was carrying

Three gold bars in violation of the National Government's Ministry of Finance's ban. Chen and the gold bars were then taken to the police station by Chinese Constable No. 412 Ma Zongzhen, who reported the situation. After the constable learned that Chen was taking the gold bars to the Tongfengyong Gold Shop, he leniently ordered Chen to find someone to bail him out. Chen then went to Tongfengyong and reported, and later Tongfengyong sent someone with Chen to the French police station to retrieve the gold bars. However, there was only one gold bar left. The other two had been embezzled by Chinese constable No. 412 Ma Zongzhen

in private. Upon discovery, the constable immediately detained Ma and transferred him to the Silk Patrol Police Station for investigation. The chief patrolman ordered the dismissal of Ma from his position as constable and sent Inspector Li Xianyang, Detective Guo Shaorong, Detective Zhang Dongcheng, and Xu Wensheng to investigate. It was learned that Ma had given the two embezzled gold bars to a female fellow villager, Ma Wen, who lived at No. 96 Limei Road, who then forwarded them to relatives in the Tonganli neighborhood on Route Mettens off in West Shanghai. They then went to retrieve the original stolen gold bars

and sent them to the Second Criminal Court yesterday afternoon, requesting that the defendant be arrested and detained for further investigation and prosecution. Judge Miao Qingbang presided over the First Criminal Court for the trial. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer for the French Concession authorities, presented the case. Then, Detective Guo Shaorong reported the investigation and retrieval of the stolen goods after the incident. Then, the plaintiff Chen Jinshan complained about the inspection situation. Questioned about the defendant, Ma Zongzhen confessed that he had only found one gold bar at the time and had taken the plaintiff

back to the police station. When he was near Zhu Baosan Road, the plaintiff said to me that he had two more gold bars on his body. It would be inconvenient to take them into the police station, so he took out the gold bars and asked me to keep them for him, and that he would come and get them after the matter was over. So I kept them for him, etc. Then witness Ma Wen testified that because my father also worked in the police station, I knew the defendant. The night before last, the defendant came to my house, took out a paper package, said it was gold bars, and asked me to keep them for him. Because my mother was not at home, I sent it to

My aunt's house (i.e., Tonganli, Route Mettens) to hide it. I don't know where this thing came from. The court reviewed the confessions and decided to postpone the hearing until the 30th. The defendant was detained, and the stolen goods were temporarily stored in the warehouse. The plaintiff requested to retrieve the gold bars, and he was instructed to prepare all the formal collection procedures before coming to the court to retrieve the gold bars.

### Japanese Soldiers Beat Pedestrians

Jiang Yuanshui (39 years old), a native of Changzhou, intended to take a train to his hometown from Hongkou at 6:30 yesterday morning. When he passed the Garden Bridge, Japanese soldiers wanted to check his pass. Because Jiang took it out too slowly, he angered the Japanese soldiers, who immediately used their rifle butts to strike Jiang's head and hands several times. After Jiang was injured, he was sent to the hospital for treatment by a carriage.

### Manager of Yuanyuan Hat Shop Accused of Deliberately Framing Someone

Accusing Wu Changlin of Instigating Threats

Wu Countersues for Slander, Trial Scheduled

Fan Jingmei, the shareholder and manager of the Yuanyuan Hat Shop on Shandong Road, was recently sued in the First Special Court by Wu Changlin, an employee of the Chen Tianyi Hat Shop on Jixiang Street in the French Concession, who hired lawyers Fan Gang and Qian Xingzhong to accuse him of deliberately framing someone and requesting that he be brought to justice. The main points of the lawsuit are that the plaintiff is an employee of the Chen Tianyi Hat Shop,

and the defendant, Fan Jingmei, was the former manager of the shop. In 1921, the shareholders discovered that the defendant's accounts were unclear and demanded an investigation. The defendant resigned as a result and has since had a grudge against the shop. There have been more than a dozen lawsuits involving the shop. Employees who had been working in the hat shop for a long time were also listed as defendants, causing some employees to die from depression due to the lawsuits. First there was Zhou Bingwen, then Zou Shicai. Recently, the defendant again falsely claimed that the plaintiff was the

Chief accountant of the Chen Tianyi Hat Shop and filed a lawsuit against the plaintiff in the Second Special Court for embezzlement. The plaintiff believed that the allegations made by the defendant were completely fabricated, so he countersued for slander. That case has not yet been concluded. Unexpectedly, the defendant again falsely reported to the Central Police Station that someone had thrown feces at the Yuanyuan Hat Shop that the defendant had set up at the end of last year's lunar calendar, and that Xie Baodou and Xia, Han and others had threatened the defendant by telephone, saying that they were going to use grenades. It was said that Xie Baodou and others were actually

instigated by the plaintiff. The police then sent Western and Chinese detectives to report to the French police station on the 28th of last month, and they sent personnel to come and arrest the plaintiff. The plaintiff was out at the time, so he was not arrested. The next day, the plaintiff voluntarily surrendered to the police station for investigation and learned that the Xie Bin and others mentioned by the defendant were all identified by the defendant on the phone. It can be seen that the defendant's claim that he was threatened and that the plaintiff instigated it was

completely fictitious and deliberately slanderous. The circumstances are obvious. Therefore, according to Article 169 of the Criminal Law, he filed a charge of slander, requesting that the defendant be punished according to law. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the Third Criminal Court to summon the case. The defendant Fan Jingmei also went to court with a lawyer. Judge Huang stated that according to the police report, Wu Changlin's name was on the list, which clearly meant that the defendant had reported him. The defendant denied it. The court decided to postpone the case to the 30th for further hearing.

### Two People Commit Suicide by Poisoning

One Dead, One in Critical Condition

Jiang Peng, a local woman, 56 years old, who lived at No. 325 Weihaiwei Road, had a quarrel with her family over family matters at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning. Afterwards, she swallowed a large amount of raw opium and committed suicide. After being discovered by her family, she was immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, because she had been poisoned deeply, the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 11:00 PM in the evening. Li Weiwu (30 years old), a resident of Room 305 of the Tianran Hotel on Zhizhong Road in the Public Concession, committed suicide by swallowing medicine at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning due to economic pressure. He was later discovered by the waiter and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, he was deeply poisoned and his life was in danger.

### Bandit Shot and Killed

At around 8:00 PM last night, bandits broke into a certain number 377, Lane, Connault Road, Route Hertaud in West Shanghai and committed robbery. The victim called for the police to catch the bandits. Nearby Chinese constables heard the sound and rushed to the scene. Seeing the police arriving, the bandits immediately used their guns to resist arrest. The Chinese constables also used their guns to return fire. One bandit was shot down at the time and was seriously injured. The remaining bandits did not have time to steal anything and fled in different directions. Afterwards, the injured bandit was sent to the police hospital for treatment, but died shortly after due to his serious injuries. The police are strictly pursuing the bandits at large.

### Twenty-Seven Baskets of Tianjin Vegetables Conceal a Huge Amount of Opium

Amounting to More Than 3,000 Taels, Perpetrators Fled

The Guisheng Wheel of the Jardine Matheson Company, fully loaded with cargo and passengers, arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin the day before yesterday and docked at the Beijing Road Wharf at 4:00 PM.

### Case of Li Yongkuan and His Sons Rescheduled for Trial

Due to the Presiding Judge's Leave of Absence

Li Yongkuan, a well-known Anhui salt smuggler, and his four sons, Li Jiaqi, Jia Zhou, and Bi Hua, made a living by selling salt in Minhang before August 13. After the outbreak of war, after the National Army retreated westward, Li and others became traitors, leading the enemy ashore, gathering accomplices, calling themselves the Eleventh Army, and setting fires and looting everywhere, doing whatever they wanted. They used Caojing in Punan as their base and forcibly married She Yuexian (17 years old), the daughter of She Zhuping, the owner of the Xihutang Pharmacy in Songjiang County, and Lin Xiuhua, the daughter of Lin Ban, to Jia Zhou and Bi Hua. Beforehand, they had washed away the clothes and property of the She and Lin families three times. Afterwards, Li Yazhou shot and killed Lin Xiuhua's daughter and buried her in a pit. The villagers feared them like tigers and dared not compare with them. Moreover, because the area was in the occupied area, there was no way to report or investigate. Until April of last year, after the regular army's 61st Division learned of this, Li was disarmed. Because Li could not stand in the countryside, in September, he took his family with the two daughters of the Lin and She families to Shanghai, renting at No. 11, Middle and New Village, Ciyou Road, behind the Xujiahui Catholic Church, restricting the two girls' freedom of movement. Until December 10 of last year, the two girls of the Lin and She families were able to escape by chance and seek help from the Virgin Mary's Hospital in the Catholic Church. The hospital reported to the French police, who broke in on the 12th, sending detectives to arrest Li Yongkuan, Li Yazhou, and Li Biba, one after another, and seized the original stolen gold bracelets, gold rings, leather clothes, and other items from the homes of the Lin and She families and took them back to the police station for investigation before sending them to the Second Special Court for legal action. Due to the jurisdiction issue, the Second Special Court reported to the Supreme Court, which designated the Second Special Court to hear the case. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. This case was scheduled for a continuation hearing yesterday afternoon, but because Judge Liao, who was presiding over the case, had requested leave, Judge Miao presided over the First Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought to the case. Without questioning them, he ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for 2:00 PM on the 28th. The defendants were still held at the police station. It is said that the court has sent personnel to the countryside in secret to investigate the evidence due to the serious circumstances of this case, in order to be cautious and thorough, in order to ensure that there is no injustice. The evidence has not yet come back and is indeed awaiting evidence.

### Hongqiao Yilong Rice Shop Owner Ding Shanming Kidnapped

He owns a three-unit residential building in Henan, in the town, which was almost completely burned down by Japanese soldiers last year. After the Shanghai war, Ding remained in the countryside, running his rice business, and profited greatly. Recently, he was coveted by bandits. The other day, at dusk, more than ten bandits suddenly appeared, each armed with guns, and stormed into the shop. They robbed more than 200 French currency from the drawer in the accounting office and kidnapped the shop owner, Ding Shanming, before leaving. It is now said that the bandits sent a letter demanding a ransom of 5,000 yuan for his release.

### Japanese Soldiers Shoot Boatmen

Recently, three thieves in the western part of the Suzhou River, at night, took a small boat to cross over to Zhabei to steal. Unexpectedly, when they landed, they were noticed by the Japanese Marine Corps guards there, who immediately opened fire and ordered them to stop. The thieves, realizing that the situation was bad, immediately tried to escape. As a result, two of them were caught by the Japanese soldiers, and one escaped. However, one boatman was shot and killed during the gunfire, and the two captured thieves were immediately taken to the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters for interrogation. Then, in the evening, they were taken to the burned-out open space behind the Traffic Bank warehouse and beheaded.

### Receiving Stolen Mud Case - Sentencing Set for the 31st

The German firm禅臣 洋行 (Zen Sun & Co.) due to debt, took over all the machinery and goods of the Shanghai Cement Plant in South Shanghai. After being occupied by the X army, all the Elephant Brand cement was moved away, worth hundreds of thousands. It was later found that sixteen brick and ash shops in the public concession were selling these stolen goods, so they sued the Special No. 1 Court. It was found that Yonghe Brick and Ash Shop at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route du Marche, Zhihe Brick and Ash Shop on Route Petain, and Huifeng Hardware Store on Min Guo Road in the French Concession were also selling the stolen cement. Therefore, lawyers were commissioned to sue the three managers, Huang Jingqing, Xu Zhengde, Meng Yiming, and others for the crime of receiving stolen goods in the Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. The case was initially heard by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, and it was decided to transfer the files to the Special No. 1 Court for verification and further questioning.

### Luo Jiaqiao Blockaded, All Vessels Stop at Wanfu Bridge

Since the Japanese side blockaded various small ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, most foreign vessels have been traveling to Luojiaqiao in the new port. Further upstream is controlled by Japanese commercial vessels. Unexpectedly, Luo Jiaqiao is also within the blockade. Yuan Luchen, the puppet magistrate of Jingjiang, in order to make up for the shortage of income, recently went to Nantong by car with the puppet Japanese secretary Xiong Shengzhi and Tao Mingde to request Captain Matsuura, the commander of the Japanese Jiangbei Garrison, to allow Jianglun vessels to open and dock at Luo Jiaqiao, but the request was rejected. Therefore, in recent days, the Japanese troops in Luo Jiaqiao in the Sixth District have opened fire indiscriminately whenever ships enter the port. As a result, ships such as Luan and Haide have changed their stops to Wanfu Bridge to the east of Luo Jiaqiao.

### High-Pressure System Passing Through, Weather Suddenly Turns Cold

Wind Force Does Not Abate, Temperature Lower Than Yesterday

The weather in this city has been gradually warming in recent days. Since the day before yesterday, a strong northerly wind suddenly blew, and the temperature dropped sharply. The wind became even stronger in the evening, followed by rain. Although the rain had turned to clear skies yesterday, the northerly wind had not abated, and the weather remained cold. According to inquiries with the Observatory, the reason for this sudden change in weather is due to the passage of a high-pressure system from northern China. The high-pressure system is moving eastward and has not yet crossed the eastern part of China, so the wind has not stopped, and the weather is cold. It is expected that the weather will not change further, and the temperature will not decrease further. The lowest temperature yesterday was 33 degrees, which was lower than the day before.

However, the counterfeit coins have no image of Sun Yat-sen on the back. Citizens rarely pay attention, so those who are deceived and suffer losses are countless.

Six minutes later, Sun Huizhang shot at the goal, hitting the goalpost and bouncing back. Shen Shiyan caught up and pushed the ball in, but Sun was offside and the goal was disallowed. In the 35th minute, Shen Shiyan scored a goal, and one minute later, Sun Huizhang followed up with another goal. With time running out, Tung Wah defeated St. Francis 6-1, winning the championship.

### Lido Celebration Tea Dance Today

The Lido Sports Association, with the active promotion of the Gao Huai De and Huai Liang brothers, has become increasingly famous in recent months. Cross-country, race walking, and small ball have been repeatedly fought and won, with silver cups and shields piled up like mountains. The football team recently won the Scott Cup, which has only been won twice by Chinese teams in more than 30 years, which is the ultimate honor. The other day, they defeated the Surveying Team again and returned with the Junior Cup. As for their Group C championship, it is undoubtedly theirs. In total, Lido has won the soccer three-cotton standard, the fifth All-Shanghai Open Championship for race walking, the International Cup and Lincoln Cup for cross-country, the Min Guang Cup (won two times), and the Yong Yi Cup, Binhai Cup, Green Fruit Cup (charity match) for small ball. The football team's 3-2 victory over the Joint Forces team, which gathered the elite forces of Shanghai, was even more shocking to China and abroad. To celebrate the occasion, President Gao has specially set aside 5:00 PM today to hold a grand tea dance, inviting famous Chinese and foreign figures from all over Shanghai, senior sports figures, and Chinese and Western reporters. At that time, the intersection of Machetz Road and Hersht Road will be busy with traffic, presenting an unprecedented grand occasion.

### Zhuang Zexuan Discusses Higher Education Reform Issues (Part 1)

Cultivating Talent for Inland Construction

Cultivating Specialized Talent for Frontier Colonization

Mr. Zhuang Zexuan, a renowned professor at a domestic university, previously discussed issues concerning secondary education reform, which received significant attention from the education sector. Recently, he has also discussed issues of higher education reform. His proposals are highly relevant to current problems. We are now publishing Mr. Zhuang's original text below:

Seven or eight years ago, I published my opinions on the "Revolution in Higher Education," believing that future universities should be divided into three parts: (1) "Continuing Existing Training," (2) "Cultivating Talent for Inland Construction," and (3) "Cultivating Specialized Talent for Frontier Colonization." Since the War of Resistance, I have felt even more strongly the necessity of implementing this kind of division. The reason I advocate for universities to add parts (2) and (3) can be explained from both theoretical and practical perspectives. In theory, I believe that: (1) Chinese education must follow a path that suits the Chinese nation to find a way out; (2) The way out for the Chinese nation currently lies in two active avenues: (a) Reorganizing the inland to stabilize people's lives and discover the advantages of (inherent) culture, and (b) Developing the frontier to establish a new life for the old culture; (3) The way out for the Chinese nation must also consider two points from a passive perspective: (a) Striving for efficiency in time, energy, and especially in the use of funds to support the precarious situation, and (b) Encouraging national self-confidence and self-reliance to create a psychological foundation for revival; (4) For the sake of reorganizing the inland, what we need most is the training of leaders in rural construction, while the general population should receive broad-based public education; (5) For the sake of developing the frontier, government capitalists must cooperate with experts, applying scientific knowledge and skills, working from film to promotion. During promotion, special training must be given to immigrants; (6) To strive for economic efficiency, government and social leaders must promote a frugal lifestyle and prevent all waste. All education must focus on thrift; (7) To build national self-confidence and self-reliance, we should promote the virtues of the Chinese nation at all times and places, disseminate the great achievements and figures in history, and promote domestic goods. These words seem even more urgent today, after twenty months of the War of Resistance. From a practical perspective, we know that before the War of Resistance, institutions of higher education that attempted to work on reorganizing the inland included the Henan Rural Governance College, the Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute, the Hebei County Administration Construction Research Institute, the Jiangsu Provincial Education College, the Sichuan Provincial Education College, and the Rural Administration Practice Center jointly established by the five universities of North China in Jining, Shandong. Institutions that attempted to work on developing the frontier included the branches of the Central Political School established in various frontier regions. After observing education in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai, I suggested enriching Gansu College to become a center for researching frontier culture and experimenting with frontier education. In fact, overseas emigration is also an important part of this work and was one of the original intentions of establishing National Jinan University. After the War of Resistance, due to the expansion of the war zone, many public and private universities moved from the coastal provinces to the inland and remote provinces. Although some were left in foreign concessions, this relocation and remaining were mostly decided on the spur of the moment and rarely planned in advance. As a result, some provinces have a plethora of higher education institutions, with no plan for division of labor and cooperation. However, places in need of higher education lack such institutions, and no universities have moved there, leading to the establishment of a provincial temporary university in Zhejiang.

### Private Elementary Schools Promote Spiritual Mobilization

Since the central government announced the National Spiritual Mobilization Order, the Liaison Association of Private Elementary School Principals in this city has been initiating promotion by the chairman convening the directors, and then the directors promoting the members, all promoting it together. The spiritual mobilization of private elementary school principals has already begun to be implemented in various schools this week. Some faculty and staff have been fully mobilized. All faculty and staff are very excited. According to the planned schedule, the association can complete this work simultaneously in all educational corporations in the city.

### Ding Fubao's Collection Donated to Aurora University

More than 50,000 volumes in total

Mr. Ding Fubao, a famous doctor in this city, recently donated all of his treasured collection of over 50,000 volumes of ancient books to the Aurora University Library on Rue Luber. Last year, Mr. Ding established the "Ding's Library" inside the Medical Bookstore on Meizi Road to meet the needs of society. However, the site was too small and insufficient to accommodate his entire collection. Therefore, he made a grand wish to donate all of his books to a larger library. Coincidentally, Aurora University on Rue Luber had just completed a new library the year before, which was opened to the public, attracting the attention of those who love to learn. When the library heard of Mr. Ding's intention to donate books, they immediately made contact. Mr. Ding readily agreed and agreed with the school on seven methods for donating the books, which were officially signed this Saturday (the 25th). The collection will be named "Ding's Collection" in memory. All books have begun to be transported to the school library in batches by truck. Once the handover is complete, they will be quickly cataloged and made available for circulation. It is also heard that the library intends to hold an exhibition of Ding's collection in the autumn semester, after some slight organization, selecting several fine editions, along with Mr. Ding's own books, annotated books, so that the public can see them first.

### Education Briefs

Mr. Biao Can, one of the seven elders of Cambridge University in England, a 79-year-old pastor, arrived in Hong Kong on the 17th of this month, and then arrived in Shanghai on the British ship Gough the day before yesterday. After staying in Shanghai for a few days, he will go to the mainland through Zhejiang to observe the actual situation of China's War of Resistance. Finally, he will go to Sichuan to visit his son, who is now in charge of hospital affairs at the Baoning Hospital in Sichuan.

Recently, shameless merchants have been promoting inferior goods to various schools, falsely using the names of Chen Heqin and representatives of the Ministry of Education. The Private School Advancement Association has informed all schools to be vigilant.

Chinese and American students at Johns Hopkins University in Shanghai have launched an alumni association. The first gathering dinner will be held at the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road, West Bridge, at 7 pm on March 28. Students who have not received a notice can directly notify Dai Shi, Room 103, No. 496, Avenue Joffre, telephone number 80076, to reserve a seat.

The Society of Geographic Trade will hold its 15th annual meeting in Chongqing this month. In accordance with the regulations, directors will be re-elected in Chongqing within this month. At that time, directors will also be re-elected in accordance with the regulations.

Spring and Autumn

### Rescuing the Famine of Short Plays

— Ye Fugen

— From the Weekly Performances of the Drama Society to Playwriting —

The "play famine," a serious symptom in the theatrical movement, becomes increasingly severe as theatrical work unfolds. How to solve the "play famine" has become an important issue in theatrical workers' meetings for several years, but it has not been resolved. This is one of the main reasons why the theatrical movement cannot keep pace with objective conditions and develop to the stage it should and can reach.

Before the War of Resistance, the relatively large number of play publications in magazines such as "Guangming" Bi-monthly, "Drama Times," and "New Drama" laid the foundation for the mobile theatrical troupes on the eve of the War of Resistance and the thriving national salvation theatrical troupes at the beginning of the War of Resistance. However, with the development of the War of Resistance situation, the theatrical situation changed drastically. Compared with any artistic field in the cultural sector, theatrical work unfolded at the highest speed. On the one hand, the need for performances increased sharply, and the old scripts immediately felt insufficient; on the other hand, due to changes and expansion in objective conditions and the audience, the old scripts naturally became unsuitable for application. As a result, the symptom of "play famine" became more serious. Unfortunately, the Third Department of the Arts Office, which has a majority of playwrights and is led by Mr. Tian Han, known for his speed in writing plays, was unable to systematically and planfully produce and supply a large number of plays to theatrical troupes in various places, in addition to dispatching theatrical troupes. Of course, theatrical troupes in various places can create, rush to make, and adapt scripts suitable for the locality of each theatrical base, which can achieve special performance effects; however, scripts with universal themes suitable for general performances can be widely distributed, and its universal effect should be even more considerable.

Until four months ago, in a Chongqing dispatch in this newspaper, we saw the Ministry of Education's "Thirteen Methods for Publicly Soliciting Anti-Japanese War Scripts as a Propaganda Weapon." For example, the first rule stipulates: "In order to encourage playwriting and to enable the general public to have a deep understanding of the War of Resistance and national construction, we are publicly soliciting excellent plays and operas that are beneficial to the War of Resistance and national construction, for use in public performances by the theater community." This is one of the concrete measures attempting to solve the "play famine."

The methods set for this public solicitation are quite detailed and specific: in terms of types, there are two types of plays: multi-act plays and one-act plays; in terms of nature, including plays and operas (referring to Peking opera and Sichuan opera); in terms of form, attention is paid to performances that can be performed in both urban and rural areas; the production method is mainly based on new creations that have not been published, supplemented by translations of good foreign works or adaptations of existing operas; the evaluation is by the Ministry of Education hiring experts to form an evaluation committee; the awards are provided in cash, and the copyright still belongs to the author.

The deadline for solicitation, the end of March, is just around the corner. How many scripts have been submitted? How large is the number of excellent and applicable scripts among them? To what extent can the "play famine" be alleviated? This is unknown to us who are far away in the isolated island of Shanghai and have no contact with the Ministry of Education. I hope that the results of this solicitation will be very fruitful, with excellent results, and that it will be able to alleviate most of the serious symptoms of the "play famine."

Here, let's talk about recent events. Hope is just hope, even if the Ministry of Education's solicitation of scripts achieves satisfactory results, how much benefit and treatment will it have for the "play famine" symptom in our local theatrical work at this time and place? The limitations of objective conditions are so severe! There are so few available scripts and new creations! On the contrary, the need has greatly increased. Look: the Yilin Drama Society is reheating "cold rice" in the Sunday morning show at the Carlton Theater. Although one-third of the performances of the Amateur Theater Friendship Society at the Green Treasure Theater are new works, the supply required by the remaining thirty or forty small theater groups is still too far off. What about the Shanghai Drama Society? Although the multi-act full-length plays used for large performances can be self-sufficient, some of the performance catalogs announced for the weekly experimental performances are quite difficult to satisfy! Obviously, performance restrictions are ten times more constrained than in the mainland, and creation is also lacking many times compared to the mainland. The lack of short plays in small performances is simply forming a starvation disease due to famine.

What to do? If the disease is on oneself, one must take medicine while sick. The famine of short plays in Shanghai must be rescued by our Shanghai theater people themselves.

Originally, performance work and playwriting are mutually causal. There is a contradictory opposition and a contradictory unity between performance and creation. Sometimes, due to a lack of performance opportunities and a stagnant atmosphere, the creative atmosphere will decline; conversely, sometimes the abundance or quality of creative scripts will stimulate a climax of performance work; this is a mutually influencing causal effect. Sometimes, due to many and intense performance opportunities, playwrights are busy with stage work and have little time to write at their desks, and the creation of plays will decrease accordingly; this is the contradiction between the two. (Of course, the so-called reduction in creation here refers to the quantity of playwriting. The script produced by a playwright who is busy participating in practical stage work will often surpass that of a screenwriter who spends all day working at a desk.) Sometimes, due to many and intense performance opportunities, the actual need will stimulate playwrights to produce more works; this is the unity of the two working relationships.

Now, how should we link small performance work with short play creation work? This is a question of how theater workers can appropriately coordinate the two sides and advance at the same time. Only by solving this problem can the play famine in Sunday morning performances be rescued.

Here, let me copy down the scope of topics limited in the Ministry of Education's script solicitation methods for comrades who are interested in playwriting to use as a reference:

(A) Clarifying that the interests of the nation and the people are higher than everything else, and enhancing the people's belief in serving the nation and the people.

(B) Encouraging compatriots from all walks of life to eliminate all prejudices, thoroughly and sincerely unite, unify their will, support the leader, support the government, and implement the policies of the War of Resistance and national construction.

(C) Exposing the brutality and ambitions of the invaders.

(D) Explaining the strategy of comprehensive and long-term resistance to strengthen the people's belief in the final victory.

(E) Advocating production and construction, saving, donating money, national military service, voluntary labor, contributing money and effort to enhance the strength of the War of Resistance.

(F) Commending loyalty and martyrdom, eradicating traitors, and eliminating the ideas of complacency and decadence to consolidate the rear.

(G) Other magnificent historical events that inspire the people and benefit the War of Resistance and national construction, or modern stories that are beneficial to the world and people's hearts.

Note: The above seven items are copied from the Chongqing dispatch in the education column of the January issue of Shen Bao.

Taking these scope of materials as the premise, coordinating them with the special conditions of this time and place, and using the special, universal, and typical personnel that occur and exist in this special environment to image, sing, cry, both sad and magnificent stories or materials; objects and events that can be praised, satirized, exposed, and hinted at, aren't there many of them? Write it, friend! If you have the experience of writing plays and can skillfully compile them, you can naturally succeed. Otherwise, as long as the attitude is loyal, the writing style is realistic, the emotions are sincere, the images are vivid, and the writing is simple, it can also be considered a high-quality work.

Finally, I would like to pass on the words of Kikuchi Kan to young theater people who are interested in writing plays but have not tried it yet, as encouragement, to replace the conclusion:

"Novels are not easy to learn, there is no teaching method, and there is no learning method. Drama, because it has a format, is easy to learn, and the effect of hard work can also be seen. Compared with novels, it is easier to get started and easier to improve."

"The first reason for the depression of new drama writers is simply not working hard."

"Except for those who have no literary qualities at all, as long as they are willing to work hard, and they write appropriately, it is impossible not to write."

"As long as you can continue to work hard on drama, good works can definitely be obtained. As long as you can make good works, no matter how unknown you are, you can become famous overnight. Compared with novels, the outcome of drama is easier to determine..."

Friend, since you have not gone to the front line to gamble on the victory of the nation, why not gamble on the victory in playwriting? Come on, give it a try and save the play famine.

### Thoughts on "The Son of Frankenstein"

— Li Zhihua

“Son of Frankenstein”

Produced by Universal Company, shown at the Da Guangming Theater

In terms of the cast, "The Son of Frankenstein" will undoubtedly be a film that audiences who like to watch horror films will pay attention to. "Frankenstein" Karloff, "Zombie" Lugosi, and Leon Errol, who impressed people in the color horror film "Mystery of the Wax Museum," are all "competing" here; with such a grand lineup, gathering "terrorists" together, it certainly has its momentum in the appeal of "business eyes," but in such a "momentum" of gathering "terrorists" together, we also see the fate of horror films reaching the end of their rope. The hired screenwriters of Hollywood have exhausted their bizarre and absurd ideas, and the producers are unwilling to give up the production of horror films. Therefore, they have to gather "terrorists" together as an appeal to "business eyes."

In fact, a horror film cannot be supported by a few actors alone; the most important factor is not so much the actors as it is the photography, effects, and even makeup; and the one that determines their soul is the director's weaving. Screenwriters, judging from the few films I have seen, almost all steal the name of science and use their fantasies to bewitch the audience. The amount of ingredients is only the strength of the fantasy.

"The Son of Frankenstein" is also like this. And for convenience, this is still a continuation of "Frankenstein." The protagonist in the play is no longer Baron Frankenstein, but his son Walford. "Walford accidentally went to the laboratory where the baron studied science during his lifetime to inspect it, and unexpectedly met the madman Yegor. Yegor was sentenced to hanging for stealing corpses, and his body was abandoned in a chaotic post after the execution. Unexpectedly, although Yegor's neck was broken, he was immortal. He hid in the baron's laboratory and teamed up with the monster to instigate the monster to kill six jurors in the village. Yegor led Hua to the baron's tomb, where he saw the Frankenstein monster lying stiffly inside. Hua was quite horrified. Yegor said that the monster was struck by electricity, causing him to faint and be unconscious. He begged Hua to treat him. Hua has always liked to study science, and he couldn't help but itch when he heard the words," so he treated him, and then harmed his hometown again, and then, "the monster accidentally fell into a boiling sulfur pit," and then ended.

As mentioned above, the so-called "science" in horror films is just a synonym for the screenwriter's fantasy. By letting this fantasy run wild, he can do whatever he wants, and he has also run out of the guise of "science." For example, Yegor in this film is "immortal even though his neck is broken," and he can also instigate the monster to go out and snipe jurors. Due to such a convenient fantasy, the "resurrection" of the "monster" is naturally unimportant, and it is not necessary to have a scientific basis.

What about the performance results? The castle, the tomb, the solitary and monotonous architecture, the eerie and strong light, the sudden high notes, or the sobbing flute and the horrible laughter, are repeatedly applied, but they are only continuously applied. There is no center, and there is no systematic organization. Therefore, these things that we are familiar with in general horror films give us a very faint impression. A gun has to move its machine hub and aim at the target to kill people. If the target is not accurate and the injury is not vital, it will weaken its function. Of course, this is not a reason to acquit the murderer, but fortunately, the other party is just an inferior shooter.

If you want me to talk about the actors' acting skills, then I like Leon Errol. His detective with a broken right arm gave him many opportunities to act; as for Karloff and Lugosi, they just maintained their original state.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 6: Praising the Centenarian, One Sprout Bears Three Blossoms, Narrating Friendship, Two Scholars Meet Heroes

When it was time for lunch, Zhu Airen said to them, "I'm going to the nursery this afternoon. Would you like to go and take a look?" When the two Miss He heard that they were going to the nursery, they were of course extra happy. Because the first reason was that they heard Airen talk about the triplets yesterday, and they wanted to see them. Although they themselves are twins, they only have one more person now, and they seem to find it very strange. He Liyu said first, "Sister Airen! When we go to the nursery, can we go and see the three 'mutants' of the Fang family? Didn't you already promise us yesterday?" Zhu Airen smiled and said, "Of course you can see them. But in fact, there is nothing to see, just three little children with the same appearance. It's better for you to look at yourselves than to look at them." At this time, He Liyu suddenly thought of something, and whispered two sentences to Shuangyu. It turned out that she remembered Zhu Airen's joking remark yesterday, saying, "I can't let you see them for nothing, you have to pay a meeting fee." Although they also knew that this sentence was said in jest, it seemed that for these triplets, there should be some gifts, preferably toys. But in such a short period of time, where would they find three of the same things? While they were whispering to each other, Zhu Airen was very sensitive and had already noticed. She said, "What are you discussing? I already know. Yesterday I was just joking, but you took it seriously and thought you really had to pay a meeting fee? Then we have become disguised beggars for the children to perform tricks. If you want to give any gifts, you can give them later, you don't have to do it right now. Besides, in our nursery, we have cultivated a sense of public awareness from childhood. There is no saying that a certain toy is the private property of a certain child. All toys can be played by everyone. Therefore, whenever anyone comes to the nursery and sees these triplets, they give clothes, toys, etc. But we also make it public, and it is not exclusively for the three children of the Fang family. But we think that this sense of public spirit should be cultivated from an early age." He Bianyu said, "Okay! Then even if we want to give something, we will slowly think about what to give." After eating lunch, the two Miss He followed Zhu Airen to the nursery. There are more than 300 babies in this nursery, about the same number of boys and girls. However, the children there are only raised to the age of six, at most to the age of seven. Because six or seven years old is the age to go to elementary school, it is not within the scope of the nursery, so the parents or guardians of the children have to find their own way. (70)

### London Left-Wing People Perform Anti-Fascist Satire

— Danyun

There is a theater for left-wing people in the north of London, called the Unity Theater. Recently, every night it performs a political satire of a large scale that can be said to be rare in England, which has caused a sensation.

This satire is called "The Child in the Forest." It was originally adapted from a rich saying told to children. The content is about an easily deceived old gentleman whose name is "Bad Uncle" and two robbers who get land. Now, the ones performing at the "Unity" Theater are all workers. They perform this script every night after work. They adapted it themselves to perform the tragedy of Czechoslovakia, and satirized Chamberlain, Hitler, and Mussolini. They even ridiculed the King and Queen of England.

But the result of this satire is happy, and not as tragic as the Czech incident. Because the script performs that the "Bad Uncle" forced the small family under his protection to give the land to the robbers in order to survive. However, at the critical moment, a knight came to help and drew his sword to help. In order to "educate" the people and unite them, the knight stopped the "Bad Uncle" and said that he couldn't do this, so he saved the small family under the protection of the "Bad Uncle." Who is this knight? It turns out to be Robin Hood.

But there is a question, wouldn't such a drama satirizing the heads of state be banned? It turns out that the "Unity Theater" is a club, with a membership fee of five corners, plus a ticket price of at least two corners and five points and up to six corners and two points, so inspectors cannot interfere.

The "Unity Theater" is very small, and can only accommodate 380 people, but so far, 14,000 people have watched this satire. It is expected that before the show closes, another 20,000 people will go to see it.

Several of the theater organizers are left-leaning intellectuals. Their purpose is to assist in the urgent struggle for world peace, and to oppose Fascism by performing dramas that are realistic, reflect current life, and do not just show a world of dreams that escape reality. I recently received a page from Shen Bao forty years ago from a friend. It was probably the era of oiled paper. According to its age, it was still during the Guangxu period. I am now transcribing several of its theater advertisements as follows:

The picture shows the expressions of the actor who plays the "Bad Uncle" (imitating Chamberlain)

### 蒨蒨室劇話

— By 肖傖

A Beauty Greatly Admired Wang Yu-feng's Sanxian Ballad Singing; Offered 100,000 Yuan to Invite Wang to Europe, but Wang Refused to Go

In the late Qing Dynasty, there were two remarkable figures in Beijing, both blind men: (1) The face-reading bone toucher, Little Blind Man, who was greatly renowned for his divine physiognomy, especially his prediction about Yuan Shikai, which was the most remarkably accurate. When Yuan Xiangcheng was thirty-seven years old, he sought refuge in Beijing from Korea, feeling quite depressed. He visited Little Blind Man for a bone-touching face reading. Following the usual procedure, Little Blind Man touched his bones and said to Xiangcheng, "I usually charge one gold piece for a face reading, but your case is very different from ordinary people, so I require five gold pieces to offer you a few words." Xiangcheng said, "Agreed." Little Blind Man said, "Your fortune will rise at forty, be killed at sixty, be below one person, and above ten thousand people." Xiangcheng, at that time, was also intimidated by the power of autocracy, fearing that others would know, and quickly left. Later, Xiangcheng indeed received the position of Commander of the Right Army of the Wuwei at the age of forty. From then on, he had smooth sailing, and his name shook the country. At the age of fifty-nine, he died after taking broad beans. It is said that Little Blind Man was eventually murdered by Yuan's people, but the truth of this remains unknown. (2) The blind man Wang Yu-feng, skilled in the sanxian, could produce the sounds of various opera tunes and military music between his fingers. His sanxian ballad singing of Peking Opera could accurately imitate the voices of famous performers. Thirty years ago, my friend Mr. Xi Yanzi was able to, in a movie theater on Sanma Road in Shanghai, now the site of a Qingyise store, pay for two balcony seats to quietly listen to Wang Yu-feng's sanxian ballad singing. Yu-feng played the song "Entering the Palace Twice," imitating Tan Xinpei for the male roles, Chen Delin for the female roles, and Qiu Guixian for the painted face roles. Those in the audience who listened with their eyes closed could not help but tap their feet and praise at the highlights. Today's sanxian ballad singing and sanxian opera are mostly inherited from his style. In that year, an American wealthy merchant valued his art and specially negotiated with him, inviting him to perform in Victoria, offering 100,000 gold as a gift, but Yu-feng did not agree. The world is amazed at the high prices Mei Lanfang received for going to the United States and Russia, but in fact, Wang Yu-feng, as a substitute, had already greatly impressed Europeans and Americans thirty years ago, and his skill relied solely on the movement of his fingers. To pass down the art, Wang Yu-feng was truly a remarkable figure in Beijing.

Talking About Opera Advertisements from Forty Years Ago

Opera advertisements aim to attract audiences. Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the opera business has developed in a distorted manner. Those in charge did not devote themselves to advertising and promotion to achieve significant results. Recently, there was Golden's "Standard Peking Opera," the Common Stage's "Taking Off Pants in Public, Ruining Feng Shui on the Grave," the Great Stage's "One Table of Dishes Flying In, Head-On Collision, Don't Turn Off the Lights," Carlton's "Escaping Fire Towards Fire, Sitting Immobile with a Woman in One's Lap," and Tianchan's "Directly Inherited from Delin, Successor of the Tan School," each with its own style.

The above advertisements, because the Shen Bao newspaper in the past did not have the clean white paper of today and were all printed in No. 5 font, the advertising text was purely in the old-fashioned style, which cannot be compared to the diverse styles of today's advertising text.

### Entertainment News

After performing for two weeks at the Tianchan Stage, the famous dan Huang Guiqiu left and will not continue. The theater sent Weng Xieyao yesterday on the Desheng ship to the north to bring the veteran laosheng and wusheng Liu Hanchen south to star in the new play "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights." The stage mechanisms and props for the play have been prepared and rehearsals will begin tomorrow.

Yu Yunggu of the Gengxin Stage invited the kun dan Zhang Wenling the night before last, and negotiations are still ongoing as of yesterday, with a high hope of reaching an agreement.

Mao Jianqiu, the pillar kun dan of the Common Stage, returned to the stage last night after taking leave.

The wusheng Zhang Zhuxuan of the Great Stage suffered from a sore throat and was treated by Dr. He Boyong, but he still performed his duties despite his illness and did not take leave. Since Han Suqiu left recently, the roles she played have been filled by Yu Xiuxia, who has been well received by the audience.

Gu Wuwu, who left Hong Kong and his Standard Opera Troupe, returned to Shanghai by ship and is staying at Xiao Wenlin's house. He said that he had not heard any rumors about the fire at the Lee Theatre.

### Miss Lin Da Arrives in Shanghai from Europe

The Sen Luo Dance Palace recently added famous Beijing ladies Yu Meishan, famous Beijing school beauty Lin Nanhua, contemporary famous star Chen Meiyan (also known as Little Sichuan), Bai Jieping (resembling Hu Die), etc., to its Red Star lineup. Recently, it also spent a lot of money to hire Miss Lin Da (Miss Linda) from Europe. She performs amazing techniques at the palace every night, so the audience has been crowded for days, and the scene is unprecedented. (Wang Lan)

The entertainment industry will be closed for one day tomorrow as usual, please pay attention to the readers.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Opera World in the Old Capital (130)

— Xu Muyun

Speaking of the Relationship between Empress Dowager Cixi and An Dehai Because of Visiting His Mother

This is also the downside of his youth and ignorance, relying on his merits to be arrogant. After Ding Baozhen beheaded Little Anzi, he also displayed the corpse for three days to quell the rumors. Some people also said that he first cut off An Dehai's small head, and then chopped off his big head, using this to cover up the scandal for Empress Dowager Cixi. Later, the Empress Dowager understood everything, and thought that since her lover was dead anyway, she might as well learn to be a generous ruler. Not only did she not punish Old Ding, but she also promoted him to Governor-General of Sichuan. In those days, among the officials serving outside the capital, the Governor-General was the most respected, and the Governor-General of Sichuan was considered the best position. In those years, Duan Fang, who had become the Governor-General of Liangjiang, was still not satisfied and was willing to spend 300,000 yuan to buy the position of Governor-General of Sichuan for fun. Who knew that he was killed by revolutionary martyrs on the way, before he reached his post. Ding Baozhen caused a great disaster, but instead received the best position, which he never dreamed of.

Many years ago, I heard a Cantonese opera record of "Empress Dowager Cixi Sacrificing to An Dehai." The lyrics were very sad and touching, which shows that their romantic affair was widely spread in the early years. Gubeikou was the starting point of their love affair. "Visiting His Mother" is a very popular play nowadays, and the border crossing in this play is also Gubeikou, so I specially combined these two things into one. As for the situation of Si Lang and An Dehai crossing the border, one stole the Empress Dowager Xiao's command arrow, and when he arrived at the border, he still acted grandly and sang four lines of Yaoban leisurely, warning the guards not to be lazy and not to be fooled by the southern barbarians disguising themselves. In fact, he was pretending, and he was talking about himself. Therefore, Yang Si Lang can be considered to have sneaked across the border. Speaking of Little Anzi, he was different from Si Lang. He clearly carried the Empress Dowager Cixi's secret decree, but he did not mention crossing the border. When he was saying goodbye to the guards, he learned a method of "pursuing by seeming to let go," and suddenly rushed in. Therefore, he was someone who forced his way through the border. Sneaking across is civilized, and forcing one's way through is impolite. As for the scene of robbing the border that has been performed recently, I am afraid that it is even more advanced and has become barbaric.

### The Spirit of the Yellow Flower Mound Martyrs

— By Huang Hanrui

Resisting oppression, overthrowing autocracy, and not hesitating to pay the price of blood and flesh, this great spirit is worthy of our admiration. The Yellow Flower Mound battle resulted in the deaths of seventy-two martyrs, who achieved benevolence but not success, but undoubtedly this was the main force in overthrowing the Qing government. The Wuchang Uprising in 1911 established the Republic of China, which was the result of the martyrs' bloodshed. To admire the martyrs, we must commemorate them for:

(1) A Profound Sense of National Concept - Ordinary people only know about family and discard the concept of society and country. The martyrs could see the bigger picture. They could see that when the country was about to perish due to the corruption of the Qing court, they had no choice but to risk their lives in the battlefield of gunfire and bullets with the oppressors.

(2) Abundant Sacrificial Spirit - The sacrificial spirit of the martyrs is heavier than Mount Tai. They can abandon their own happiness for the sake of the masses. Their unyielding and relentless efforts are our model.

(3) Innovative Thinking - The corrupt Qing court was really too old and decayed. If it existed, the result would be the destruction of China. The martyrs had a new position and had to overthrow this outdated rule. They were standing at the forefront of the times.

(4) The Truthfulness of Their Emotions - We can see from the martyrs' farewell letters to their parents and wives and children that they are all tearful. Comforting parents and encouraging sons to continue the revolutionary work they had not completed are all lingering and emotional. They certainly had strong reason, but also rich emotions. This is a good example for today's youth.

It has been twenty-eight years since the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound were martyred. Today, during the War of Resistance, recalling the past, the course of struggle is so difficult. Here, we must continue the spirit of the martyrs to shoulder the unprecedented task of national liberation and achieve the final victory, so that we will not fail today's commemoration.

### The Story of Yellow Flower Mound

— By Lu Lishi

If we go to Guangzhou, we must visit the Yellow Flower Mound under Baiyun Mountain. The white stone tomb and iron railings are dominated by a stone pavilion. In the stone pavilion, there is a stele, which reads "Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs." Behind the tomb, there is a memorial arch, and behind that, there is a large stone pavilion, which is magnificently built. Our President Sun Yat-sen wrote the words "The Spirit of Righteousness Endures Forever" in this pavilion, and above the pavilion stands a goddess of freedom.

When we walk here, we will think of the heroic and tragic story of the seventy-two martyrs: This happened in the third year of the Xuantong era of the Qing Dynasty. Many revolutionary comrades demanded national freedom, so on March 29th, under the guidance of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, they took pistols and bombs and carried out the tenth revolution, setting out to attack the Guangzhou Governor-General's Yamen.

At that time, Huang Xing was appointed commander, leading the bomb squad, rushing into the city, advancing into the governor's office, killing the enemy's street team to death, the escapees fled, the momentum was huge, and the enemies were terrified.

To catch the bandits, you must first catch the king. General Huang intended to capture Governor-General Zhang Mingqi. While searching, a large Qing army came to the rescue. They knew that the enemy was numerous and their own people were few, so they could not win. However, in order to arouse the revolutionary thinking of their compatriots, they disregarded their own lives and fought with the Qing soldiers. As a result, they killed hundreds of Qing soldiers, but the revolutionary comrades, because the rear was not contacted, some were martyred at the time, and some were captured by the Qing soldiers and became martyrs. In addition to General Huang, who was shot in the hands and feet but still led the remnants to kill, a total of seventy-two martyrs tragically sacrificed for the revolution.

After their deaths, Mr. Pan Dawei buried their bodies together under the Yellow Flower Mound of Baiyun Mountain in the east of Guangzhou, which became the only glorious memorial place in our country.

### Diligent in Action, Cautious in Speech

— By Shan Shixiong

"Diligent in action, cautious in speech" is a profound saying.

"Action" means the meaning of doing. We often hear the phrase "consistency between words and deeds," but in reality, many people "say one thing and do another" or "do one thing and say another." Such people's lofty talks, even if they are good at it, no matter how loud their words are, no matter how arrogant their talks are, because their consciousness is not correct, or what they do cannot adapt to reality, therefore, nothing can be successful. There are also many people who just bury their heads in hard work. Although they rarely speak at ordinary times, the results of what these people do are often successful. For example, Stalin of the Soviet Union suffered many great setbacks more than a decade ago, but he was able to be diligent in action and cautious in speech, coupled with a spirit of hard work and courage, so after his two five-year plan of struggle, he has now made the Soviet Union a rich and strong country. Another example is our President Chiang Kai-shek. He is careful in handling military and political affairs. Before doing anything, he has already had a plan in mind, so he can now be called the leader of resisting the enemy and reviving the country.

If we can earnestly do what the ancients said, "diligent in action, cautious in speech," then we can get many benefits in our lives, and we will certainly have considerable achievements in our studies and careers.

"Too much talk leads to mistakes." The explanation of this sentence is that if a person talks too much, he will inevitably make mistakes. However, in my opinion, this sentence is not necessarily correct. Because I think that a person should speak as much as possible of what he wants to say and should say, but before buying, he must think about it, then this kind of person can become great.

From this point of view, a person's words and deeds must be "diligent" and "cautious," and to achieve extraordinary careers and learning, one must also develop a habit of "diligent in action and cautious in speech."

### Chatting

— By Bai Zheng

——Ming'er's Escape Diary Seventeen——

Smooth sailing is the most welcome thing in the minds of boatmen. It saves effort and is fast. But Ming'er's boat was sailing upstream on the Qiantang River, so of course there was no hope of smooth sailing, so they just hoped for the only fair wind day and night. That morning, the sky was not very helpful, with a small headwind, but in the afternoon, the wind direction changed somehow, and gusts of wind blew from the stern, so the boatmen were overjoyed and hurriedly hung a large sail on the tall mast. The sail was urged by the wind, and it seemed to increase the power of the boat a lot, and it finally overcame its resistance and suddenly accelerated the speed of the boat. The faces of the boatmen also seemed to be covered with a layer of joy, and they each took their pipes to the stern to smoke. The boat boss (the boatmen call him "Captain," as a sign of respect) was also smoking at the bow. Ming'er came out of the dull cabin at this time to get some fresh air. He saw the boat boss sitting there very得意 at the moment, so he had many questions in his heart to ask him, taking advantage of this good opportunity.

"Captain, how far did we travel today?" Ming'er asked him with some "rotten" Mandarin. "Today, guess." The boat boss refused to answer him. "Twenty or thirty miles?" "Yes," Ming'er was happy in his heart, thinking that he had guessed correctly, but later he realized that it was not. Ming'er's intelligence was originally very superstitious on the boat. If the boat is sailing in a fair wind, you must not ask how far the boat has traveled. If you ask this question, the fair wind will not blow for long. Ming'er secretly laughed at their superstition. However, these few words opened their conversation box, and Ming'er asked questions endlessly.

"How many years has this boat been built? How much money? Where are you from? How many days will it take to get to Tunxi?" A string of questions like this pressed the boat boss to answer, so that Ming'er's father in the boat cabin was also secretly laughing.

"I am from Fuyang. It's not far from here. I have been following my father on the boat since I was a child, growing up and starting a family. I have been eating on the boat for more than thirty years. The food on the boat is not tasty. No matter what day, what weather, whether it's raining or hot, you have to pole the boat. Just imagine the scorching sun in June shining on our backs, it seems to be burning, and blisters on the back are commonplace, sometimes they even fester. In the cold weather, we still have to work barefoot, in the ice water, on the snow. I am afraid of eating this kind of hard food. I want to find some other industries to do, but how can I do it with my clumsy body? I have to live one day as two and a half days. This boat has been built for more than seven years. We use it very carefully, so it still looks very new. The price of shipbuilding was cheaper at that time, and more than one hundred yuan was enough, but now it is not possible. The cost of repairing a boat is also very high. Every year, it has to be oiled with tung oil, and all the things in the cabin have to be decorated, so it is estimated that an extra twenty or thirty yuan has to be added to the small profit every year. Both of my brothers are boatmen. I'm not bragging, we also have a little reputation in Fuyang. This is because we do things honestly. Whether we transport goods or do business for customers, we are all honest and trustworthy. There is no fixed date to Tunxi. We rely on the sky to eat. It takes about half a month upstream, and if the wind is smooth, it can be reached in about ten days. And downstream, one week is enough." Ming'er listened to such a long paragraph with great interest. After the boat boss finished saying so much, he whistled, and Ming'er knew that he was urging the wind to blow quickly. "It's really funny, how can the wind be controlled by people?" He said secretly. He still wanted to continue asking, but his mother called him to have dinner, and as soon as he heard about eating, he turned around and walked into the cabin.

### Introducing a Group Studied at a Children's Research Institute

— By Yang Chunlu

Everyone knows that the twentieth century is a world of science. The life of mankind in the twentieth century needs to live a scientific life. If we want to seek evolution for the world and create happiness for mankind, we must strive to study science. Only scientific children are the builders of the new world in the future and the creators of a new life for mankind!

Here, I want to introduce you to a children's science research group. That is a group of little friends who love science and nature, organized in June 6th, 1935. The initial number of participants was also sixty-six, so it was named the 66 Children's Science Research Association. The purpose they hold is: "To enable children to satisfy their desire for knowledge, to obtain the benefits of joint research, and to cultivate an interest and habit of studying science."

They were originally on the Beijing-Shanghai Line in Anting Town, and they were studying happily when, unexpectedly, the sound of cannons on August 12th interrupted their work, and its original address was lost. Now, some of the members have escaped from that evil environment and resumed their work in Shanghai, continuing their past spirit and developing their future glory.

During each semester, they convene all members to hold a general meeting once to discuss the progress of the association's affairs. A research meeting is held once a month. Sometimes the center of research is stipulated, or it is changed to a speech meeting, debate meeting, field observation, experimental performance, essay contest rewards and other activities. A "Scientific Children" issue is published every Saturday and is attached to the Children's Daily as a garden for members to research each other and report their experiences.

Their organization is divided into three departments: library, research, and publication, and has a president, a clerk, and a treasurer. There are currently more than 70 members, all wearing a plum blossom-shaped "66" association emblem. When joining the association, members must pay a membership fee of 20 cents, and then pay a regular fee of 20 cents per semester.

Now they plan to expand the organization and continue to solicit new members, preparing to mobilize the children of Shanghai to explore science together. All children aged 10 to 16, whether they are continuing their studies in elementary school or learning industrial arts and commerce, as long as they are interested in science, can join. This is a good opportunity for children to study science.

Respectable little friends: get up and study science! Make yourself a scientific child and build a new world and create a new life!

### Yellow Flower Mound Memorial Day

— By Chen He, 6th Grade Student, Qinqun Elementary School

The whole sadness, oppression, suppressed my joy, and added that ruthless half-mast flag, fluttering in the universe, making people unusually desolate and full of emotion.

Opening a page of history twenty-eight years ago, I only saw artillery fire in Guangzhou, blood and flesh flying, it was truly a human tragedy and a hell on earth.

In fact, there was no success on a certain scale, but their spirit and their perseverance are worthy of our admiration and admiration!

They sacrificed for the ancestors of the past, for the grandchildren of the future, and for the country, but it was also glorious and skillful.

They have already sacrificed for the country. We should cultivate good thoughts, exercise a good physique, take the seventy-two martyrs as examples, become the backbone of future society, the pillars of the country, resist the armed invaders, and move towards the bright road, to win the glory of the nation.

### Flying a Kite

— By Yang Yi, 5th Grade Student, Shanghai Elementary School

Alas, it's time to fly kites again every year. But when can I go home and fly it in the countryside?

I remember when I was in my hometown in the past, I made an appointment with my neighbors to fly kites in the field. We took the line and ran east and west, and the kite also floated in the air with us. Suddenly, a storm came, the line broke, and the kite flew elsewhere.

Thinking back to those years, it was really happy. But what about today? I can't go home. I raise my head and look at the sky. Only silver planes are shining in the sunlight. Where can I find the trace of kites?

Children! When can we fly kites!

### Methods of Writing

— By Xu Xiuxin, 6th Grade Student, Hui Elementary School

Dear children, we are Chinese, and we should practice Chinese characters very well. Of course, there are many people who practice well, but the posture is not right. Now I will briefly write it down below.

Chinese characters are roughly divided into seven types: (1) Ancient Script, (2) Great Seal Script, (3) Small Seal Script, (4) Clerical Script, (5) Cursive Script, (6) Regular Script, (7) Running Script. Now I am talking about the sixth type, Regular Script, so I will first talk about the method of writing Regular Script. In the past, there were three methods of writing: (1) Tracing, (2) Reflecting Characters, (3) Copying. Now I am talking about copying from rubbings. There are five methods of copying: (1) Penmanship, Penmanship is divided into three types: (1) Suspended Wrist Method, (2) Elbow Movement Method, (3) Leaning Wrist Method, (1) Posture, face the front, keep the torso straight, place both arms flat, keep the wrist parallel to the table, and keep the right arm and left arm at right angles. There are two types of brush tips: middle tip and side tip. Grind the ink flat and slowly.

We use the elbow movement method for medium regular script, and the wrist movement method for small regular script. The brush tip must use the middle tip.

### My Dead Mother

— By Xia Ziliang, 5th Grade Student, Minsheng Elementary School

In a quiet black night, suddenly my heart was filled with pessimistic and terrifying thoughts. So I recalled my dearest mother.

When I was eight years old, my mother left me. How heartbroken! Every day I see many children calling out to their dear mothers, but I will never have a mother again.

### Snow White (12)

— Grandson of Heaven

That night in the seven dwarfs' little house, they were having a jolly time. What were they so busy with? They were busy with a social gathering, everyone was high-spirited and extremely happy.

So they began to hold a celebration. Grumpy found a small fiddle in a dark corner of the room, engraved with birds and frogs. He pulled the strings with both hands, playing a series of forest melodies. The other dwarfs also had their own original musical instruments, harmonizing and singing with Grumpy's playing, enjoying themselves immensely. After singing, they put down their instruments and started to dance. Their strange and interesting steps were also of their own creation. Not only did they dance themselves, but they also took turns dancing with Snow White. After all seven dwarfs had danced, she collapsed into a chair, completely out of breath, but her heart was filled with joy.

Just then, the clock's door burst open, and a metal cuckoo jumped out, calling "cuckoo, cuckoo" ten times in a row. Snow White hurriedly sat up and said, "Oh, it's long past the designated bedtime! You all should go upstairs to sleep now!"

But the seven dwarfs refused to go, insisting on giving their beds to Snow White to sleep in. Snow White couldn't persuade them otherwise, so she had to go upstairs. As she reached the top of the stairs, they were still looking up at her and shouting, "We wish you a good night's sleep and sweet dreams!" When Snow White arrived in the bedroom, she knelt down and prayed, wishing God to bless the seven dwarfs, because they were so good to her. Finally, she added, "And please do me a special favor, and make Grumpy change too, and become just like me!" At that time, the queen, disguised as an old grocery-selling woman, was preparing to set off to the seven dwarfs' place. She packed a basket of sundry goods, and carefully placed the poisoned apple on top, to avoid making a mistake at the last minute. Finally, she bid farewell to her beloved raven, and said to it, "My dear, the next time you see me, I will no longer be so old and ugly. From tonight onwards, I will once again be stunningly beautiful, the most beautiful woman in the world! And that little Snow White will be buried alive, ending her little life!"

At the time when dawn was breaking, the queen stumbled out of the tunnel, truly a hideous old woman. Under the palace, there was a black stream, flowing tortuously like a snake. She untied the mooring rope of a small boat tied to the shore, picked up a punt pole, and began to pole downstream in the foggy sky.

After poling for a while, she saw the stream flowing into the forest, clearly reaching her destination. The queen moored the boat to the shore, jumped ashore, and tiptoed towards the seven dwarfs' little house.

That morning, the seven dwarfs, because they went to bed late last night, got up later than usual. They always went to bed very early every night, never going to bed after ten o'clock in their lives. Snow White got up first, and made them a hot and delicious breakfast, standing at the door, handing them seven small buns, which turned out to be seven meat buns.

Doctor first warned Snow White, "No matter who it is, you must not let them into this house. Because that queen is an extremely cunning woman, and may come up with some tricks to deal with you."

Snow White hurriedly said, "Don't worry, nothing will happen to me."

Grumpy chimed in, "I must also warn you, that queen is capable of anything, you better be careful!"

The seven dwarfs said goodbye to Snow White and went out to work. Just as their seven figures disappeared in the distance, the little animals immediately gathered around, leading Snow White to the currant bushes near the house, picking a bucket of fresh currants, and started making currant buns.
