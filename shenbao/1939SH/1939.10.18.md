### German Land, Sea, and Air Forces Intensify Attacks on England and France. German Troops Briefly Invade France on the Western Front Before Being Repelled. German Planes Bomb Scottish Naval Port, Air Battles Ensue.

Copenhagen: A correspondent for the National Daily News stationed in Berlin reports that Hitler has abandoned hope of acting as a mediator between neutral countries and has issued final orders for a large-scale offensive. Hitler held a long meeting with naval and air force leaders on Sunday. (Reuters, 17th)

Paris: General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 85, stating, "Under the cover of artillery fire, the enemy launched an attack this morning on a six-kilometer front east of the Moselle River. They immediately occupied the high ground of Hinsberg, where our forces had only deployed a small number of scouts and laid some landmines, so they were unable to stop the enemy. The enemy then briefly invaded the village of Apach on our border, but after being heavily shelled by our artillery, they hurriedly retreated north of the village." (Havas, 16th)

Paris: General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 86, stating, "Yesterday afternoon, the enemy launched a second determined offensive on a thirty-kilometer front east of the Saar River, again using artillery cover. Our forward outposts withdrew in good order after completing their mission. The purpose of our troops' previous incursions into German territory was to indirectly aid the Polish army. Our General Headquarters, anticipating a German offensive, had redeployed these troops to other positions two weeks ago, leaving only forward outposts to scout enemy movements." (Havas, 17th)

Paris: A semi-official source commented on the current situation of the French and German armies today, stating that, as expected yesterday, the Germans dispatched a large contingent of infantry this morning, under the cover of artillery fire, to launch a relatively large-scale offensive on a six-kilometer front east of the Moselle River. This differs from the previous situation where only small units were operating sporadically. The enemy had probed this area from the first day of the war and briefly invaded French territory, but our forces immediately repelled them and counterattacked to the village of Berus in the German Saar region. Later, two weeks ago, we occupied a small forest in that area. Since then, both sides have sent scouting parties to patrol and exchange artillery fire, with no other activity. However, in recent days, the enemy has suddenly become very active in that area and has attempted to capture our soldiers to gather military intelligence. Our General Headquarters knew that the enemy was preparing to attack and withdrew some forward outposts in advance. Therefore, the enemy's attack today was within our expectations. The Hinsberg heights that the enemy occupied are the site of the outposts that we had previously abandoned. The village of Apach, which the enemy briefly invaded, is located on the border between the two countries, on the road from Thionville to Trier. After the enemy reached the village, they were subjected to intense artillery fire from our forces and retreated in disarray. The exact number of enemy troops involved in today's attack and the specific units to which they belong are not yet confirmed. It is also difficult to say whether this offensive is of a local nature or whether they are preparing to launch similar offensives along the entire line. (Havas, 16th)

Paris: It is reported that British troops have entered the Maginot Line, preparing to meet the enemy. Hitler is currently concentrating his elite troops, planning a large-scale offensive. The strongest concentration of forces is on a 65-mile to 75-mile front between the Moselle River and the Hardt Forest. Yesterday, the German artillery did not fire a single shot throughout the day, as if fearing to reveal the location of the artillery and provoke a counterattack from the Allied forces. According to sources here, Hitler may take a gamble, using all of Germany's strength, regardless of the cost, to break through the Maginot Line. Based on the German strategy in the past, the German offensive will likely be launched along the entire Rhine and Moselle Rivers. Initially, large numbers of tanks will exert pressure on two or three key points along the plains, supported by fighter planes flying low and firing machine guns, followed by bombers, so that French planes cannot counterattack the German bombers. However, the French army has made various preparations for this strategy. Therefore, if the German tanks want to advance, they must pass through mined areas and areas under artillery fire. German planes will also encounter extremely intense artillery fire. If the German army launches an attack on the Rhine front, 30,000 British soldiers with modern equipment and excellent training will inflict heavy damage. These troops are currently helping to defend the elaborately constructed Maginot Line, preventing any enemy from breaking through. These 30,000 British soldiers are the vanguard that the German army will encounter. Soon, the 32nd British Division will participate in the war in France. (Reuters, 17th)

Berlin: The German military announced this afternoon that most of the French troops who occupied German territory yesterday have withdrawn. Two British warships were hit by heavy bombs from German planes and suffered significant damage. Yesterday, enemy planes invaded German airspace and five were shot down, two of which were British. In the past week, enemy merchant ships in the North Sea and Baltic Sea have been repeatedly threatened and attacked by German forces. Between the 13th and 15th of this month, several ships in the Atlantic Ocean were sunk by German submarines, with a total tonnage of 54,396 tons. (Haitong, 17th)

London: Twelve to fourteen German planes attacked the Firth of Forth this afternoon. Two were shot down in eastern Scotland. A third was shot down into the sea in the Firth of Tay during a battle with British fighters. British ships did not suffer major damage. Only one bomb grazed the cruiser HMS Southampton, causing minor damage to the bow. The admiral's flagship and a small boat were sunk. Three crew members of the Southampton and seven crew members of the 10,000-ton cruiser HMS Edinburgh were wounded by shrapnel. One bomb fell near the destroyer HMS Mohawk, causing 25 casualties. At 2:35 PM, British planes first engaged German planes outside the Isle of May at the entrance to the Firth of Forth. One German plane was forced down to within a few feet of the sea surface before escaping. Ten minutes later, another German plane caught fire and crashed into the sea during a battle in the sky over Dalkeith. Within fifteen minutes, fierce fighting broke out in the Firth of Clyde, and a second German plane crashed into the sea. A third German plane was shot down while being pursued. The British Air Force suffered no casualties. A train crossing the Forth Bridge seemed to be one of the German planes' targets. Passengers on the train gave the most detailed eyewitness accounts of the air raid. They saw German planes fly low and drop bombs, many of which landed in the river, causing the river water to splash up. After the German planes appeared, anti-aircraft guns around Edinburgh immediately opened fire into the sky until the German planes were driven away. The weather was clear, and the explosions of the shells in the high altitude were clearly visible. Of the German planes that were shot down, the four pilots of one plane drowned, one was shot dead, and the fourth was wounded in the arm. The three pilots of a German plane that crashed in the Pentland Hills have been captured. Before the air raid, several German planes had flown over Rosyth to scout. (Reuters, 16th)

London: According to official reports, two naval officers and thirteen sailors were killed and twelve seriously injured when German planes bombed British ships in the Firth of Forth yesterday. One civilian was injured by stray machine-gun fire. (Reuters, 17th)

London: Of the dozen or so German planes that attacked the Firth of Forth yesterday, three more have now been found to have been shot down in the areas of Kincardine, Aberdour, and Queensferry. It appears that a total of seven German planes were shot down. In addition, many people claim that an eighth plane caught fire and crashed on the hillside south of the Firth of Forth. Officials are currently searching for it. (Havas, 17th)

Berlin: Officials here announced last night that between 2:30 PM and 3:30 PM this afternoon, multiple German bombers flew to the Firth of Forth to bomb British warships. As a result, two British cruisers were hit by heavy bombs. At the time, British anti-aircraft guns fired intensely, and a large number of destroyers were dispatched. As a result of the air battle, two British destroyers were shot down. Two German planes are also missing. (Haitong, 17th)

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that four German planes attacked Scapa Flow today. Two bombs landed near the British cruiser HMS Iron Duke, causing slight damage, but there were no casualties. (Reuters, 17th)

### Churchill Announces Success in Destroying German Submarines. One-Third of Sixty Have Been Destroyed. Reports on the Sinking of HMS Royal Oak.

London: First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill announced in the House of Commons today regarding the sinking of the battleship HMS Royal Oak, stating that the Admiralty believes that of the sixty German submarines that were prepared for battle at the beginning of the war, one-third have now been sunk or severely damaged. On October 13th alone, no fewer than four German submarines were sunk. German submarines have been targeting neutral shipping for two weeks. Near the end of last week, submarine warfare intensified again. On Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, four ships were sunk at the western entrance, two of which belonged to France. Three other ships were attacked but managed to escape. A total of 13,000 tons of British ships have been sunk, but it should not be assumed that all losses are on the British side. The Admiralty has so far not released the figures for the number of German submarines sunk. The attacks are being carried out vigorously and are now being intensified. For example, on Friday of last week, four German submarines were destroyed, including two of the largest and most modern ocean-going submarines in the German Navy. Such results have never been achieved in a single day during the last Great War. I can release figures for the results of last week. This is the end of the sixth week since the start of the war. A total of seven German submarines were sunk this week. We can estimate that in these six weeks, a total of thirteen German submarines have been sunk, and another five have been severely damaged or have already sunk. Several others have suffered minor damage. These figures are likely underestimations. In addition, two-thirds of the German submarines that have been deployed have been attacked with depth charges. The French Navy is also very active and has been successful. Therefore, we believe that of the sixty German submarines that were prepared for battle at the beginning of the war, one-third have been sunk or severely damaged. This accounts for at least one-fifth of the total number of the largest and most modern ocean-going submarines. Therefore, one-third to one-quarter of the German submarine fleet has been destroyed, and the loss of officers and men cannot be quickly replaced. As for British merchant shipping, a total of 21 million tons are sailing, of which 156,000 tons have been sunk by submarines. Another 18,000 tons have been lost due to mines and other accidents, totaling 174,000 tons. During the same period, we captured 29,000 tons of German ships. From this perspective, our merchant shipping has not been significantly affected by submarine warfare, while the enemy has suffered enormous losses. If this continues, the enemy will find it difficult to sustain these losses. (Reuters, 17th)

London: First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill stated in the House of Commons today that the battleship HMS Royal Oak was sunk by a German submarine at 1:30 AM on Saturday while berthed at Scapa Flow. It is incomprehensible how the submarine was able to penetrate the defenses of the harbor. During the last Great War, the area was never attacked by submarines. We must recognize this enemy submarine's infiltration as a skillful and daring act. At the time, it appears that the enemy submarine fired torpedoes at the ship. One of them hit the bow, and twenty minutes later, the enemy submarine fired three or four more torpedoes in succession, hitting the ship, causing it to capsize. The ship was berthed at the end of the harbor, so many officers and men could not be rescued and drowned. The list of survivors has now been released. In total, the number of officers and men who died is estimated to be over eight hundred. Churchill continued, "The Admiralty immediately announced the sinking of this good ship. This loss is significant, but it does not affect the large reserve of heavy ships' security. German submarines are searching extensively for the mooring place, but have not achieved any results. However, the port will be able to be declared clear after some time, as any German submarines that do not surface for air will be heading for their doom. The authorities are now taking various measures to increase security, which had been effective during the last Great War." Churchill also answered a question from a Member of Parliament, stating that the booms and defenses of Scapa Flow were recently deployed and are not from the last Great War. An investigation is currently underway, and once it is completed, he will be able to answer further questions. (Reuters, 17th)

London: Minister for Co-ordination of Defence Lord Chatfield reported on the sinking of the battleship HMS Royal Oak in the House of Lords this afternoon, stating, "This ship was berthed at Scapa Flow in Scotland and was sunk by a German submarine at 1:30 AM on the 14th of this month. The submarine first fired two torpedoes, one of which hit the ship's hull. Twenty minutes later, it fired three or four more torpedoes, and the ship was sunk. A total of over eight hundred officers and men died. Although this loss is significant, our country possesses many large warships, and the level of security remains extremely sufficient. The naval authorities have been actively searching for enemy submarines in the area where warships are moored in Scapa Flow, but so far, there have been no results. It is expected that the area can be declared safe after some time. In addition, the naval authorities have taken the necessary defense measures, following the methods of the last European War, to ensure safety." Lord Chatfield then reported on the German air raid on the Firth of Forth yesterday, stating, "A total of twelve or more German planes, divided into several groups of two or three planes each, took turns bombing. One British civilian was hit by shrapnel from anti-aircraft shells and suffered minor injuries. The damage to civilian property was also very minor. A total of four German planes were shot down, and several others may not have been able to return to base, which I firmly believe. Three of our naval officers and thirteen sailors have died, and eleven sailors have been seriously injured, while fifty-one sailors have been slightly injured. The damage to the cruisers HMS Southampton and HMS Edinburgh and the destroyer HMS Mohawk was very minor. Up until this morning, four German planes flew to Scapa Flow again to bomb. At the time, two bombs landed near the battleship HMS Iron Duke, causing slight damage to the ship. One enemy plane was shot down, and another was also damaged." (Havas, 17th)

### Commander of German Submarines Promoted to Rear Admiral

Berlin: German Naval Commander-in-Chief Raeder awarded the Iron Cross to officers and crew members of submarines for their outstanding achievements at Scapa Flow today, as a reward. The submarine had fired mines that destroyed the British battleship HMS Royal Oak and the cruiser HMS Repulse. It is also reported that Führer Hitler has issued an order promoting the commander of German submarines, Dönitz, to Rear Admiral. (Haitong, 17th)

Moscow: Soviet naval expert Ivanov published an article in Izvestia today, stating that German submarines can make England feel threatened, and England's attempt to blockade Germany cannot achieve significant results. He also said that since the outbreak of the war, German submarines have not only severely impacted England's overseas trade but also inflicted significant losses on the English navy, as evidenced by the sinking of HMS Courageous and HMS Royal Oak by German submarines. As for the English warships not being able to enter the Baltic Sea, Germany's trade with the countries of the North Sea will not be obstructed. At the same time, Italy's maintenance of neutrality and the contiguity of the territories of the Soviet Union and Germany can allow Germany to obtain the raw materials it needs. These are all factors that are beneficial to Germany. Moreover, the German submarines and air force are extraordinarily active and can threaten English maritime shipping. (Haitong, 17th)

London: The thirty-two crew members of the SS Sneaton (3,600 tons), which was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic on Saturday, arrived at a port on the south coast today. (Reuters, 17th)

Paris: The Information Bureau announced that the French postal ship SS Bretagne (10,000 tons) and the cargo ship SS Louisiane (7,000 tons) were sunk by two German submarines in the Atlantic on the 14th of this month. Five crew members and two passengers on the Bretagne are missing, and their fate is unknown. The chief mate of the Louisiane died. At least one of the submarines has been sunk by our warships. (Havas, 16th)

New York: It is reported that the British cargo ship SS Loch Madoes, which was sunk by a German submarine on the 14th of this month, was carrying 30 boxes of contraband aircraft parts, weighing 200 tons, hidden in a secret part of the ship. This has now been discovered by the German Navy. (Haitong, 17th)

London: A Greek ship was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean a few days ago. The Danish ship SS Sicilia sailed to rescue them and immediately rescued twenty-seven crew members. These people have landed in England. Seven of them have sustained serious injuries. (Havas, 16th)

Berne, Switzerland: The Neue Zürcher Zeitung reports that the German Navy has redeployed a large number of mines in the Baltic Sea, from the south of Falsterbo Island to the west of the German coastal Stral Sund. The intention is to prohibit any ships from entering or exiting the Great Belt and Little Belt Straits. (Havas, 16th)

### Reports of Air Raid on Emden, Germany

Winschoten, Netherlands: According to many residents on the German border, the port of Emden, Germany, was subjected to an air raid at around 11:00 AM today. At that time, several planes were flying at high altitude. The sound of exploding bombs was heard very clearly, and the smoke was visible. The German anti-aircraft guns fired intensely. In addition, artillery fire was heard in the Emden area this morning. (Havas, 17th)

Oslo: Fishermen have reported that a German ship was sunk. It is claimed that on Saturday and Sunday, three British ships and one British plane attacked a German ship off the west coast of Norway. After firing several shots, a plume of black smoke rose from the water. The British ships then sailed away. (Reuters, 17th)

Oslo: A violent explosion occurred west of the Oxøy lighthouse today. It is believed that an oil tanker exploded and caught fire. (Reuters, 17th)

### Air Raid Alarms Sound Throughout England

London: According to official announcements today, a plane of unknown nationality appeared near Hull and Grimsby this morning. The authorities immediately took precautionary measures and issued an air raid alarm at 11:00 AM. However, as no German planes were seen, the alarm was lifted 50 minutes later. Air raid alarms were also issued in Blyth. Thousands of people rushed to air-raid shelters, and traffic on the streets came to a standstill, but there was no panic. The mouth of the Firth of Forth also sounded the alarm at 11:12 AM and lifted it at 11:30 AM. (Reuters, 17th)

### British Air Force Flies Reconnaissance Missions Over Germany

London: The Air Ministry announced that several British planes flew reconnaissance missions over western and northwestern Germany yesterday. All except one plane, which is missing, have returned safely to their base. (Havas, 17th)

### Germans Claim to Have Shot Down British and French Planes

Berlin: The German High Command announced yesterday that a British bomber was shot down by German anti-aircraft guns near Grosskrotzenburg. One British pilot was killed, and the other three were captured. Yesterday morning, a French reconnaissance plane was shot down by the Germans near Zehmens. One French pilot was killed, and the other two were injured and sent to a hospital for treatment. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)

### English Emphasis:

### The British Emphasize Poland's Strategic Position: German Offensive Suffers Heavy Losses; Polish Forces in Occupied Areas Continue to Resist

London – The Polish Embassy in London recently issued a public statement saying that German newspapers have recently published reports of German troops in occupied Poland being repeatedly attacked by "armed bandits." Upon investigation, the German side's claims of "armed bandits" are entirely malicious slander. In reality, they are regular Polish army units continuing to strongly resist German and Soviet troops within the occupied areas. According to reliable sources, Polish army units are currently fighting German troops in the south near the Carpathian Mountains and in the north near the Suwałki region. Other units are continuing to resist the Red Army in the Białowieża Forest area in the west. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

London – The Information Department recently issued a public statement, stating that German propaganda organs have repeatedly spread messages intended to create the impression that Poland was sacrificed for the sake of the Allied nations of Britain and France, and that despite the Polish army's efforts to resist, it was of no benefit to those countries. All these claims are untrue. In reality, Britain and France will rely heavily on Polish assistance to achieve final victory in the future, as can be clearly seen from the following points:

(1) The number of German casualties in Poland is certainly higher than that announced by Hitler himself. In his report to the House of Commons on the 6th of this month, he stated that the German army had 10,572 killed, 30,000 wounded, and 3,000 missing. In reality, the total number is likely around 150,000. This estimate is not an exaggeration. Given that the decisive battle is likely to be prolonged, such heavy casualties in the early stages of the German offensive cannot be underestimated.

(2) German military equipment losses are quite significant. Regarding tanks, it is said that 83 were lost in a certain offensive. Later, in a counter-offensive near Lviv in southern Poland on September 16th, General Sosnkowski reportedly destroyed another 100. As for the air force, German losses are also considerable, and fuel consumption is undoubtedly huge.

(3) The 70 divisions of German troops on the Eastern Front have been constrained by the Polish army, preventing them from being transferred to the Western Front, thus allowing France to complete its mobilization work at its leisure.

(4) Because of the need to cope with the Eastern Front, the German army had to concentrate a large air force in Poland, allowing the British army to safely cross the English Channel and land in France.

(5) The British and French armies have been able to fully understand how the German army uses its air force, tanks, and motorized units by observing the situation on the Eastern Front.

(6) During the fighting on the Eastern Front, the Polish army's lines were not particularly strong, but German infantry units were still unable to advance without tank cover. The German army, knowing that the French Maginot Line is far stronger, must already have a deep impression of fighting on the Western Front. Moreover, although Poland's anti-tank artillery force is not very large, it can still inflict heavy damage on German tanks. Therefore, when German tank units operate on the Western Front, all drivers will inevitably be apprehensive about the far greater power of French anti-tank artillery.

(7) The Polish army's steadfast defense of Warsaw and Modlin Fortress has won the admiration of the world. The British and French armies have been deeply stimulated and their fighting spirit has been further inspired. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Editorial

### Japan's Peace Movement

Recently, the Japanese news agency Domei, communicating via Hong Kong telegraph, created an atmosphere suggesting that the Chinese Nationalist Government was seeking peace negotiations with Japan. Such statements, without any corroborating evidence, are considered rumors. Rumors that are disproven are considered fabrications. In this case, both corroborating and disproving evidence are lacking, so Domei's telegraph lies somewhere between rumor and hearsay. Rumors and hearsay are not suitable subjects for commentary. However, international relations dictate that war must eventually be followed by peace. Therefore, even if the Nationalist Government's seeking peace is a fabrication today, the issue of peace negotiations will eventually become a reality. The Sino-Japanese conflict involves a wide range of issues, so the ending of the Sino-Japanese War is an integral part of solving world problems. Because of this, Chinese or Japanese, British, French, German, Italian, Soviet, or American people, in short, no one can ignore this rumor or hearsay. Furthermore, according to a recent dispatch from Chongqing, British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, was received by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and had a lengthy conversation after arriving in Chongqing. Since the matter was not public, outsiders cannot know the content of the discussion. To claim knowledge would be absurd. However, it provides ample new material for rumors or hearsay.

To go to war from a state of peace, and to seek peace from a state of war, is a major national issue. On this major issue, people may not all share the same ideas, but their actions must not be disjointed but must maintain a united national front to preserve the nation. For example, a month after Britain declared war on Germany, the opposition politician Lloyd George advocated for not hastily closing the door to negotiations. His words were gentle, but his meaning was clear. However, he only went as far as "each expressing their own opinion" and never abruptly abandoned Chamberlain to befriend Hitler. This was not because Lloyd George lacked confidence or strength, but because no national issue is greater than war and peace. It is not the same in China. From beginning to end, China has never had the choice of whether to fight or not, whether to resist or not. Forced by a powerful enemy's deep invasion, self-defense and survival are the only options, and resistance is the only path. Therefore, there is no turning back from going to war. Even now, foreign aggression persists, and the danger remains. In short, as long as the state of aggression is not resolved and individual freedom is not guaranteed, there is no choice between making peace or not, negotiating or not. The issue is not war or peace, but simply choosing between survival and annihilation. Therefore, war and peace are major issues for general nations, but not for China. To say that it is an issue, originating from Chongqing, is either a childish insult from the other party or a self-declaration of their own wishful thinking.

Judging from the fundamental nature of the Sino-Japanese conflict, the problem does not lie with both China and Japan, but solely with Japan. Moreover, the problem on the Japanese side is whether to continue the aggression or abandon it. Continuing the aggression inevitably leads to war, while abandoning the aggression will naturally lead to peace. Therefore, the essence of the problem is not so-called war or peace. Examining the facts, the problem is not even this. In reality, it is impossible for Japan to continue its aggression, but it is unwilling to abandon it. From this, we can understand what Japan is scheming, planning, agonizing over, and striving for in every possible way: to achieve its aggressive ambitions without war. Even if it cannot achieve all of its aggressive ambitions, it seeks to end the war at the current stage and not fight again, to reap the full benefits of its aggression at the current stage. Observe their actions: First, make the military firmly defend the points and lines they have invaded and occupied. In the future, military operations will not focus on advancing forward, but will instead be eager to "sweep away" the military and civilian forces in the occupied areas of China, turning points and lines into planes. Second, make entrepreneurs, financiers, and industrial, commercial, shipping operators compete to be the first, excluding other countries, seeking immediate profits in the near term and building a solid foundation in the long term, gaining tangible benefits under their control, turning the occupied areas from planes into three-dimensional entities. Third, political operatives, under the secret of using Chinese to control Chinese, support tools and use knives to kill, acting as outposts and tentacles for their military and economic aggression, and when things are quiet, cleaning the courtyards and patrolling the granaries. Fourth, make scholars and literati talk about benevolence and righteousness, gloss over mistakes, and engage in flowery rhetoric, attracting people to take the bait, signing unfulfilled promises with irresponsible identities, using the trick of anesthetization to achieve the grand effect of attacking the mind. Whether these four aspects achieve success is another matter. However, the various tactics used by Japan today cannot be hidden from the world's eyes and ears.

The difference between sincerity and falsehood may only be a hair's breadth. How can we be sure that Japan will never abandon its aggression and has no sincerity to repent? Their officials and people, with parched lips and weary tongues, bow deeply. Can we simply dismiss them as hypocritical? This is where we can find disproving evidence: All the peace movements and peace theories that the Japanese side has created are massively exported to the occupied areas of China. However, great principles such as stopping the war, negotiating peace on equal terms, correcting past mistakes, and promoting the spirit of mutual respect have never been marketed in their own three islands. Why is this? If this disproving evidence is insufficient, then we must await factual actions to prove the abandonment of aggression. But where can we find clear evidence of factual actions?

### Hitler Dispatches Special Envoy to Moscow to Seek Aid: Carries Handwritten Letter to Stalin; Hitler Also Speaks with Italian Prime Minister

London – The Daily Mail recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in the capital of the Netherlands, stating that, according to reliable sources in Berlin, the German government sent a special envoy to Moscow last night. The person is said to be Gabriel, a senior official from the Ministry of Economics. He is carrying a letter from Hitler himself to Stalin, requesting that the Soviet government fulfill its promises and come to Germany's aid. The Soviet side is said to have expressed its willingness to provide assistance and recognize Hungary and Yugoslavia as within Germany's sphere of influence, but only on the condition that Germany recognize Finland, Sweden, Norway, Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey as within the Soviet sphere of influence and allow the Soviet Union to act freely. In addition, Italy was not mentioned at all. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Amsterdam – According to a dispatch from the Berlin correspondent of the "Telegraaf," Hitler sent a special envoy with a personal letter to Stalin in Moscow yesterday and is currently eagerly awaiting Stalin's reply. It is also said that Hitler is also communicating with Rome by telephone and has sent an envoy for consultation. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Stockholm – The Dagens Nyheter recently published a message from Berlin stating that German Chancellor Hitler convened an important military conference yesterday and afterwards sent special envoys to Moscow and Rome for consultations. It is said that he is requesting Soviet assistance in exchange for allowing the Soviet Union to act freely in Scandinavia. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Amsterdam – The Berlin correspondent of the "Telegraaf" reports that the content of the German-Italian talks is confusing and difficult to grasp. Mussolini's strong opposition to cooperating with the Soviet Union to confront the Western democracies seems to be a constant and unwavering principle. Italy had already made significant sacrifices fighting against the communists in Spain and finds it difficult to tolerate opening the Mediterranean to the Soviet Union. Although Rome does not oppose the conclusion of a non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, it strongly opposes active cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union, even if Germany has made significant concessions to the Soviet Union. The correspondent also stated that it is currently difficult to predict the outcome of the German-Italian talks, but judging from the large number of German troops currently being transferred to the Western Front, Germany does not seem willing to provide military assistance to the Soviet Union. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### German Delegation Arrives in Moscow to Discuss Repatriation Issue

Moscow – A German delegation, led by embassy counselor von Köfer, arrived here this afternoon by special plane to negotiate with the Soviet authorities on the relocation of the German minorities within the Soviet sphere of influence in Poland. The total number of these Germans is about 150,000, mostly farmers. 70,000 of the Germans in Eastern Galicia, 60,000 in Volhynia, and 20,000 in Białystok will be relocated to the provinces of Posen and West Prussia. Political circles here believe that the relocation will be completed in early winter. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)

### Soviet and Italian Ambassadors Visit British Foreign Secretary

London – Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon and held talks. According to well-informed sources, the two exchanged views on bilateral trade relations and various international issues, including the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey and Finland. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

London – Italian Ambassador to the UK, Bastianini, formally visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon after assuming his post. According to diplomatic circles, this is more than just a routine introductory visit. Ambassador Bastianini must have brought detailed instructions, and the attitude of Italy towards the current situation should be clear after the talks. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

London – Today, Italian official radio broadcasts hinted that Italian Ambassador to the UK, Bastianini, is carrying a letter from Mussolini expressing his willingness to establish a better balance of power in the Balkans and Danube regions. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Trade Agreement Established Between Germany and Yugoslavia: Yugoslavia Exchanges Raw Materials for German Military Supplies; Italy and Yugoslavia Also Conduct Trade Negotiations

Belgrade – It is learned that Germany has signed a protocol with Yugoslavia to replace the original trade agreement, with a validity period of six months. According to the original agreement, Yugoslavia was to supply Germany with 30,000 carloads of wheat, which has now been reduced to 10,000 carloads. The original agreement to supply 20,000 carloads of corn has now been changed to 45,000 tons of vegetable oil. The quantity of timber that Yugoslavia should supply remains the same, but when Germany needs it, Yugoslavia should exchange minerals and various other raw materials and agricultural products for German military equipment. In addition, Yugoslavia should export 300,000 pigs to Germany each year in exchange for German military supplies of equal value. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Belgrade – An Italian trade delegation, led by Dr. Mazzi, Director of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Finance, arrived here yesterday to conduct talks with the Yugoslav Ministry of Commerce on the development of bilateral trade. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)

### Many Differences Remain in Soviet-Turkish Mutual Assistance Pact: Turkish Foreign Minister Returns Home with Soviet Proposals; Negotiations Between the Two Countries Will Continue

Moscow – Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu is scheduled to return to his country tonight without signing any agreement with the Soviet government. Although the Turkish side stated that both sides have made suggestions that need to be studied at length, the fact is that Saraçoğlu's return is to report the situation of the negotiations to the government, but the negotiations have stopped and many differences remain. Furthermore, the Turkish economic delegation, led by Agriculture Minister Ekrem, is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow to visit the agricultural exhibition. Saraçoğlu's departure before their arrival is noteworthy. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Moscow – Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu departed from here for Ankara tonight without signing any agreement with the authorities here. According to authoritative Soviet sources, this is a good sign, not only does it not indicate a breakdown in negotiations, but it also indicates that the negotiations are nearing success. Therefore, according to observations from authoritative sources here, a Soviet-Turkish mutual assistance treaty may soon be concluded quickly. It is said that the Turkish Foreign Minister returned home with concrete Soviet proposals for the Turkish government to discuss. At the same time, after the departure of the Turkish Foreign Minister, the Turkish Minister of Agriculture and four other representatives who will arrive will continue negotiations with the Soviet government. (Associated Press dispatch, 17th)

Moscow – Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu visited Foreign Minister Molotov at the Kremlin this afternoon for two hours. The content of the meeting is unknown to outsiders. The agreement between the Soviet Union and Turkey was originally scheduled to be signed at the end of last week, but this did not materialize. The reason for this is unknown to diplomatic circles. However, some speculate that both sides wanted to resolve certain issues related to the Balkans first. In addition, according to a message from the capital of Turkey from an American news agency, Turkey has rejected various demands made by the Soviet Union and notified the Soviet Union of two points: (1) If Italy joins the war, Turkey will assist Britain and France; (2) Turkey cannot accept the formation of a group of Balkan countries controlled by Germany and the Soviet Union. Diplomatic circles here believe that this news is exaggerated. In fact, negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey have probably not progressed to this stage. However, one thing can be asserted: judging from the delay in these negotiations, it can be seen that Turkey is resisting certain Soviet demands with patience and determination. In short, Turkey has consistently adhered to its obligations to Britain and France in these negotiations, which has been praised by the people of those countries, and it is said that the rumor of a joint German-Soviet control of the Balkans does not correspond to the facts, as Germany has already voluntarily retreated in this respect and allowed the Soviet Union to act freely. In any case, there is no doubt that Turkey does not want to be a second-class country in the Balkans. It is speculated that the Soviet Union and Turkey have probably agreed to shelve the issue of Turkey's recognition of the German-Soviet division of Poland and the issue of Romania's Bessarabia province (which belonged to the Soviet Union before the European War). Judging from the fact that the Turkish economic delegation is coming to Moscow as originally planned, it can be seen that relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey are still very harmonious, and various rumors should not be lightly believed.

### Blockade of Tianjin Concession Remains Indefinite

Tokyo - According to Japanese sources from Tianjin, the Japanese side will not remove the blockade of Tianjin unless their objectives are achieved. This is the firm determination of the local Japanese military authorities. Rumors in Tianjin state that the British authorities are about to hand over the silver reserves in the British Concession and will accept the parity exchange of legal tender by the Federal Reserve banknotes. These rumors have arisen because of the recent improvement in major British-Japanese relations after the extradition of the suspects in the assassination of Cheng. However, the Japanese authorities believe that these rumors are the result of a "cunning attempt by the British side to support and maintain the value of the legal tender." (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)

### Chen Cheng Discusses Reasons for Northern Hunan Victory: Japanese Rear Lines of Communication Cut Off, Unable to Concentrate Forces on a Single Point

Nanyue, Hunan - According to General Chen Cheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Hunan-Jiangxi War Zone, in a statement to the Associated Press today, in view of the recent victory of the Chinese army in northern Hunan, if the Chinese troops were equipped with the same weaponry as the Japanese troops, the combat effectiveness of the Chinese troops would be exactly the same as that of the Japanese troops. According to General Chen Cheng, the reason for this decisive victory in northern Hunan was that the Japanese highways were thoroughly destroyed in advance, preventing the Japanese artillery and tanks from being fully utilized. At the same time, the Chinese side had sufficient time to cut off the Japanese rear lines of communication. As a result, the weaponry of the Chinese and Japanese armies was limited to rifles and machine guns, so the advantages of the Chinese army could be fully demonstrated. At the same time, after the Japanese army entered this dangerous area, it was unable to concentrate its forces to attack a single point, and the Chinese soldiers mostly wore straw sandals, so they could walk freely and without difficulty on the rugged mountain roads. This was also another reason for the victory of the Chinese army. However, he believes that the Japanese side will try to counterattack again, trying to recover the lost territory, in order to save their dignity. According to General Chen, according to unconfirmed reports, the Japanese side has transferred another five divisions to various fronts, mostly from the "Manchukuo" area. The Japanese are now determined to launch an offensive against Changsha in order to dispel the anti-war sentiment in Japan with a new victory and to save their declining prestige. It is expected that the anti-war sentiment in Japan will become increasingly strong in the future, because our victory will become more and more extensive and significant in the future. According to General Chen, on Sunday, 500 Japanese soldiers in Hebucun (transliteration) on the Fengxin Highway were completely wiped out by the Chinese army, and 3,000 Japanese soldiers in Tongcheng are also surrounded by the Chinese army. Tongcheng will be taken soon. The Chinese guerrillas northeast of Yuezhou are now hindering the Japanese army's actions, and he said that when the Japanese army attacked Changsha, the Japanese defense fortifications in Yuezhou had been destroyed by the Chinese guerrillas. General Chen appeared tired when he met with foreign reporters here. It is heard that in these two weeks, General Chen's average sleep time has been no more than two hours per day. According to General Chen, the current strategy adopted by China is to destroy the Japanese lines of communication. When foreign reporters traveled from Hengyang to Nanyue to inspect the situation on the northern Hunan front, they saw that all the places they passed were the richest agricultural areas in China. Except for the farmers carrying small branches as air raid shelters, and some artillery teams heading to the front, there was no sign of war. (Associated Press dispatch of the 17th)

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Circular Orders Stepped-Up Suppression of Opium in Sichuan Province; Private Trade in Opium Absolutely Prohibited; Licenses Previously Issued to Merchants for Opium Procurement Are Abolished

Chengdu - The investigation and suppression of private opium smuggling in Sichuan Province has been difficult due to the armed protection of smuggling by traitors, bandits, and unscrupulous troops, which has seriously affected the prohibition policy.

### U.S. Neutrality Act Amendment Should Take into Account the Overall Situation in the Far East; China Is Actually Fighting for the United States and Will Surely Complete the Great Task of National Reconstruction; Chorus of Justice from Members of Congress

Washington - The relationship between the Neutrality Act amendment and the Sino-Japanese War was mentioned again in the Senate meeting yesterday. Senator Gillette, a Democrat from Iowa, said, "The 'cash and carry' clause will be a direct blow to China. The relationship between the United States and the Far East is extraordinary, so this fact must be taken into account." Congressional leaders also studied the statement of Kong Xiangxi, Director of the Executive Yuan of China, to Morris, a reporter for the Associated Press, and each person's interpretation was very different. Senator Austin from Vermont told the Associated Press yesterday that the United States must discuss the Sino-Japanese issue and the European issue together, so that the amendment to the Neutrality Act does not discriminate against China. The Senate leaders generally agreed that the United States must wait until the European issue is resolved before paying attention to the Sino-Japanese incident. Senator Minton, a Democrat from Indiana, said that the United States really has no time to take care of the Far East issue at this time. Regarding Kong Xiangxi's suggestion that President Roosevelt should mediate the Sino-Japanese incident, most senators sympathized with the foreign policy of the executive authorities and agreed that if Japan wins in China, it will put the United States in a dangerous position, but they believe that the degree of this danger is greater than the danger to the United States after Hitler wins in Europe. One of the senators privately said, "Looking at the situation from a long-term perspective, China is actually fighting for the United States today, and is doing very well. We can only maintain our consistent attitude of refusing to withdraw from the Far East. Given time, China will surely complete this great task. Our goal today must be to avoid being drawn into the European situation, so that we have time to deal with Japan. The neutrality of the United States is a guarantee to the world. Neither Japan nor Germany can win and control the world." (Associated Press dispatch of the 17th)

### Pittman Act Automatically Amended, Credit Loan Clause Revoked, Isolationists Criticize Britain and France

Washington - There are two main points to the Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: one is to abolish the arms embargo clause, and the other is to grant a 90-day credit loan to the belligerent countries. This bill has been debated in the Senate for many days. In order to shorten the debate time as much as possible, Pittman voluntarily revoked the clause "granting a 90-day credit loan to the belligerent countries" today, because this clause has aroused some resentment even among government-affiliated members. Pittman believes that it is better to revoke it directly than to prolong the debate time because of this. Regarding this matter, the opponents cited that the method of granting credit loans to the belligerent countries is in conflict with the Johnson Act (the Johnson Act stipulates that those who have not repaid their war debts to the United States may not obtain new loans from the United States). As a result, the measures implemented by the United States will change from "cash transactions and self-responsible transportation" to "credit transactions and self-responsible transportation." Now that Pittman has automatically revoked the credit loan method, the opposition has lost an important argument. According to Speaker of the House Bankhead, the House of Representatives can pass the Pittman Act after it is amended in this way. Most senators hope that the Senate can submit the bill to a vote by the end of next week. (Havas dispatch of the 16th)

Washington - The Senate continued to debate the Neutrality Act amendment today. Senator Gillette, a Democrat, spoke first, saying, "We cannot draft a Neutrality Act that can be applied to all belligerent countries in all circumstances. Even with the current Neutrality Act, its application to the Japanese aggression against China and the German aggression against Poland has been exploited. This unreasonable situation should be corrected urgently. In short, we have no Neutrality Act that can be generally applied to all events and ensure the security and interests of the United States in all circumstances. For this reason, I am prepared to vote in favor of repealing the arms embargo clause, but all transactions that specifically sell arms to a certain belligerent country and all loans that are sufficient to assist the belligerent countries in purchasing arms should be prevented." Senator Shippustead of the Labor Party then spoke, supporting the maintenance of the arms embargo clause. Senator Taft of the Republican Party (who is expected to be a candidate for the party's general election) spoke next, supporting the repeal of this clause and advocating that the new Neutrality Act should define "war zones," that is, all areas within 300 miles of the coast of belligerent countries should be designated as war zones. In addition, Senator Clark, a populist Democrat, delivered a fierce speech, accusing Britain and France of being aggressor countries, saying that these countries refused to discuss peace, but have not declared war on the Soviet Union. The United States has no reason to support them. Clark finally commented on the war debt issue of the previous European war, and made many criticisms of Britain and France.

According to current reports, the Soviet Union is demanding from Finland the cession of some islands in the Gulf of Finland that control the entrance to Kronstadt Bay, no fortification of Aaland Island, and the conclusion of a Soviet-Finnish military treaty. A spokesman for the Finnish government recently stated in Helsinki that the issues discussed in Moscow are very likely to find a practical solution, and the Finnish government will do everything in its power to find a peaceful solution. Paasikivi, the chief Finnish representative sent to Moscow, will return to Moscow as soon as possible to continue the talks.

He had a very deep understanding of the situation on the island. Before 1919, he had traveled to our country several times and therefore knew everything about our country very well." (Havas dispatch of the 17th)

Stockholm - The people of Finland living on Hogland and Tyterskär Islands, who had evacuated hastily a few days ago, have now been advised to return to their original residences.

(Haitong dispatch of the 17th)

### Under the Governance of Xue Yue, the Situation in Western Hunan Has Become Clear; Ambitious Individuals and Outlaws Have Awakened and Unanimously Embarked on the Road of Resistance

Changsha Correspondence: The "Western Hunan Problem" was raised as early as the beginning of the Republic of China. However, since Linxiang and Yueyang successively fell into the hands of the Japanese army, and northern Hunan entered the first line of national defense, with western Hunan becoming an important support point for resistance and nation-building, the "Western Hunan Problem" has become particularly closely valued and noted by people. Due to the past "isolation" of western Hunan, and the dangerousness of its geographical situation, the thirty-one counties of western Hunan (accounting for more than one-third of the land and population of the entire Hunan province) became the most ideal base for secession for general ambitious individuals. Here, they could create a secessionist situation and manage their own small world. It is said that since the demise of a division of firearms in western Hunan when Yuan Shikai attacked Tang Jiyao in the fifth year of the Republic of China, this became the initial major capital for the ambitious individuals of western Hunan to stir up trouble. With this capital, they used various means to expand their strength and utilize the vast land of western Hunan, forcing the people to plant opium. Those who disobeyed the order were all levied with a "laziness tax," setting up checkpoints everywhere and levying exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, such as pit taxes and poll taxes, with a number of names that truly reached the peak of absurdity.

Central Problem

In addition to exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, ambitious individuals further involved their military and political power to implement the "Three Grabs Doctrine" and the "Four Disregards Policy." The so-called "Three Grabs Doctrine" is: (1) grab those with power, the purpose being to warn other powerful individuals not to dare to interfere with their actions; (2) grab those with money, so as to obtain ransom; (3) grab passersby, the so-called "toll." The "Four Disregards Policy" is: (1) disregard banditry and looting; (2) disregard official corruption; (3) disregard gambling in government offices; (4) disregard the harassment of stray soldiers. Under this "Three Grabs Doctrine" and "Four Disregards Policy," the so-called Western Hunan Problem formed three central problems: 1. The "Tu Wang" problem, representing the power of the larger ambitious individuals; 2. The "Bandit" problem, representing general scattered bandits; 3. The "Tu Gao" problem, namely opium. The first character of these three central problems is all "Tu" (土, meaning soil or local). Thus, what people generally call the Western Hunan Problem is also the "Three Tu Problems." Under the oppression of the Three Tu Problems, more than a thousand people in western Hunan, for the sake of self-defense, passively purchased some weapons to protect themselves, and actively gathered parties and gathered in the mountains and forests, making their living by "robbing homes and houses," to the point where, in certain places and at certain times, the "soldiers, civilians, and bandits" were indistinguishable from each other. In the past, it was rare for anyone to pass through western Hunan without being robbed. Later, small units such as a platoon or a company passing through western Hunan would even have their weapons confiscated entirely. When Hunan University moved from Changsha to Chenxi, it "paid an insurance fee" of 300 yuan per month for the safety of teachers and students. However, this insurance fee only guaranteed that there would be no trouble within five li (approximately 2.5 kilometers) around the school. Beyond this, they were not responsible. As for the Hunan-Guizhou Highway and the Yuanjiang waterway, robberies of vehicles and ships were endless and commonplace. Under these various rumors, many shortsighted people regarded western Hunan as an incomprehensible "chaos," or even thought that western Hunan society was still stuck in the dark ancient times of China.

The Crux of the Matter

Many people believe that western Hunan has become a problem due to the "special nature of the people of western Hunan" and the "poverty," "weakness," "ignorance," and "chaos" of the entire western Hunan society. In fact, the people of western Hunan are also descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Western Hunan is buried with endless treasures all over the mountains and fields, the most prominent being aluminum, lead, zinc, coal, iron, timber, tung oil, and tea. To be fair, antimony and tung oil account for a very important number in China's annual exports. This is sufficient proof that western Hunan is not poor. The spirit of hard work and endurance of the people of western Hunan is far unmatched by other places. The bandits of western Hunan are able to win more with less. In the past, the Gu Jia-ke Division, which launched a glorious battle in Jiaxing, eastern battlefield, was entirely composed of people from western Hunan. How can they be called weak? Education in western Hunan is indeed not widespread, and the level of culture is far lower than in other places. The feudal forces are also greater than in other places, but this cannot be considered that the people of western Hunan are inherently more ignorant than other places. Western Hunan is chaotic, that is a fact, but the root cause of the chaos is not in the "people's fondness for chaos," but in the attempt by a few ambitious individuals to occupy western Hunan by means of conquest, and a part of feudal relics relying on bandits to increase their own importance, and exploiting local diseases to prolong their dying days. As a result, local politics in western Hunan has never been on the right track, and the administration has never been clear. Under the layers of violence and the oppression of the "Three Tu Problems," the people, after paying exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, still cannot get a peaceful life, and thus can only rise up to defend themselves, or even take risks. What is the root cause of the Western Hunan Problem? In a nutshell, it lies in the "Tu Wang" and the "bandits" and "Tu Gao" caused by the "Tu Wang," as well as the alienation of the exorbitant taxes, the politics, and the people.

Problem Solved

Since General Xue Yue was ordered to concurrently govern Hunan Province in February of this year, he has put forward the three characters "An Bian Zu" (安便足, meaning peace, convenience, and sufficiency), and has the greatest determination to completely solve the Western Hunan Problem. This year, he has gradually abolished the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies in western Hunan, selected and assisted military talents with political cultivation to serve as county magistrates, completely clarified the administration of western Hunan, and reduced the burden on the people. As for the elimination of the "Tu Wang," the prohibition of poppy cultivation, and the eradication of banditry, originally, there were many bandits in western Hunan because the "people could not make a living" and were forced to become bandits. Since Chairman Xue eliminated the "Tu Wang," he adopted a combination of suppression and appeasement, and combining benevolence and force, towards the bandits. As the Japanese army has already crossed the threshold of Hunan Province, the brave men of western Hunan, full of blood, have been repeatedly and earnestly instructed by Chairman Xue, and aroused with great righteousness, and finally unanimously abandoned their original involuntary life as outlaws, and embarked on the battlefield to fight for national liberation. On a clear morning in a blood-soaked May, the brave men of western Hunan, led by Generals Dai Xiao-tao and Long Yun-fei, gathered from various cities, mountains and forests, and corners of western Hunan to Yuan and Li, and then departed from Yuan and Li to the Qian-Xian front in northern Hunan. They were all wearing straw sandals, carrying guns, and wearing palm-leaf hats. Watching the large troops pass by, followed by one or two more teams, the formation was so orderly, and the discipline was so strict. General Dai spoke well at the farewell meeting held by all sectors of Yuan and Li, "The duty of a soldier is to protect the people in peacetime and defend the country in wartime. What's more, this is definitely to launch a national resistance against Japan, so this is the sacred task of a soldier. There is no need for a warm farewell, we should also run to the front line to fight. For the independence of the country, for the freedom of the nation, sacrifice is the most glorious. Sacrificing personal life can prolong the life of future generations. Sacrificing the lives of the soldiers of western Hunan can prolong the lives of the people of western Hunan. The whole country is determined to sacrifice their lives to fight for the final victory." The Western Hunan Problem, which has been unresolved for many years, symbolizes the future of this great national liberation struggle. To this fresh force in western Hunan that has joined the ranks of resistance from the perspective of national and ethnic interests, we only express our highest respect and place unlimited hope on them.

### Yunnan Nationalities Research Association Established; Chairman Long Elected Honorary President

(Kunming Correspondence) Since the successive westward movement of university research institutions, in addition to Chongqing and Chengdu, Kunming is actually one of the academic centers. Furthermore, because Yunnan Province is located on the southwestern border, research on the culture and nationalities of the border areas is attracting the attention of academics. Therefore, Mr. Wu Dingliang and Mr. Wu Wenzao, humanistic science experts from the Academia Sinica, Southwest Associated University, and Yunnan University, initiated the establishment of the Yunnan Nationalities Research Association. After several preparations, the inaugural meeting was held last month at Zhigong Hall of Yunnan University. No fewer than six or seventy people attended. Xiong Qinglai, the President of Yunnan University, was publicly elected as the chairman. After the rituals were performed, the chairman gave an opening speech, and it was decided that Wu Wenzao would report on the preparation process. It was decided to discuss the constitution and elect officers, and then it was decided that military and political officers and representatives from all walks of life would give speeches. Chairman Long of Yunnan Province was elected as Honorary President, and Zhou Xingfu, Xiong Qinglai, Li Shuhua, and Tao Menghe, the Directors of the Civil Affairs and Education Bureaus of Yunnan Province, were elected as Honorary Vice Presidents. Li Ji, Wu Dingliang, Liang Siyong, Luo Xintian, Gu Jiegang, Pan Guangdan, Chen Da, Zhou Yuncang, Yuan Tongli, Yao Xunyuan, Wen You, Ling Chunsheng, Wu Wenzao, and other thirteen people were elected as directors, and Wu Dingliang was elected as chairman of the board by the board of directors, Wu Wenzao as secretary, and Zhou Yuncang as accountant, and it was decided to carry out the following association affairs: (1) hold a lecture meeting once a month, inviting Chinese and foreign experts to serve; (2) organize an editorial and compilation committee for a bibliography and abstracts of southwest ethnology literature, divided into several groups, with three to five members serving; (3) organize a Yunnan materials specimen committee; (4) organize a southwest ethnology research work investigation committee. The establishment of this association at this time is said to be meaningful.

### Discussion on Training Scoutmasters (Part 2)

— Yang Kejing

Elaboration on the Necessity of Training Scoutmasters

It is indeed perfect if Scout teachers are trained by normal schools. However, before the normal schools offer scout courses, what should be done before there are graduates with this qualification? In my opinion, the national normal colleges should run refresher courses for scout teachers, and in accordance with the regulations for refresher courses for teachers prescribed by the Ministry, select the current unqualified scout teachers in primary and secondary schools and provide them with one year of professional training. There are six normal colleges nationwide, and each college selects 100 people each year, for a total of 600 people to receive training. Within a few years, a large number of excellent scout teachers can also be trained. Second, set up summer training courses, imitating the method of summer training courses for physical education teachers. The education authorities of various provinces and cities, together with other relevant agencies, utilize the summer vacation to train scout instructors from the entire province, and provide them with one to two months of professional training. It is common that progress in the knowledge and skills of scout leaders is not small. This is also a remedial measure for training scoutmasters during the transition period. Someone asked, "The Central Training Corps has already been comprehensively training scout cadres. The Chinese Scout Instructor Training Class has now been established in Hechuan, and it is said that it plans to continue to run for a long time. Then, is it not necessary to train scoutmasters in normal schools?" It is not the case. A seatmate said, "All things grow together without harming each other, and ways run in parallel without contradicting each other." The Central Training Corps is a continuation of the Lushan and Emeishan Training Corps. The purpose of training focuses on the ideological and spiritual aspects, in order to promote the unity of national will, thought, and action, and sincere unity, so as to increase the strength of resistance and nation-building, rather than professional training. This is very clear. Therefore, the object of its training is talents who have already become capable, rather than those who have not yet become capable. For example, military and police training is to select the current officers and police officers for training, not to replace political schools and law schools to directly train students. Again, for example, the training of teachers and staff is to select the current teachers and staff of various levels of schools for training, not to replace normal schools, sports schools, and various universities to directly train students. The same is true for scout teachers. First, they receive professional training in normal schools, and after graduation, they serve in primary and secondary schools, and then they are selected by the Central Training Corps to receive training in spirit and thought. The two are in fact mutually connected, running in parallel without contradiction. Someone also said, "Suppose the Chinese Scout Instructor Training Class of the Central Training Corps extends the study period and increases professional training. It already has the original ideological and spiritual training of the Central Training Corps, and it also has the scout professional training of normal schools. Wouldn't it be killing two birds with one stone?" To answer this question, it is necessary to compare the normal schools and the Central Training Corps first. If the Chinese Scout Instructor Training Class has all the conditions of a normal school and replaces it, it is not impossible. If it cannot have all the conditions of a normal school, it is better to follow the general method of the Central Training Corps, and during the summer and winter holidays, select the current heads and coaches of scout troops in primary and secondary schools, and give them one month of training in spirit, thought, and life discipline. This will not hinder the students' studies, nor will it cause them to incur the loss of hiring someone to substitute for them and paying them remuneration. Moreover, they can listen to the instructions of important party, government, and military officials, and the lectures of the country's first-class scholars, and understand the government's painstaking efforts for the country and the people, and the major domestic and foreign policies, and subtly influence them to return to their hometowns after training, work hard to serve, unite sincerely, consolidate the central government, and increase the strength of resistance and nation-building. In this way, it will surely receive twice the result with half the effort. The current Chinese Scout Instructor Training Class was originally run by the Chinese Scout Association and the Ministry of Education. In addition to the teachers serving in the Teacher Service Corps being trained, it also recruits personnel with at least two years of service after graduating from high school or above to supplement. The term is three months, and professional training is provided. The purpose is to train crash personnel to meet the current urgent needs. After the start of the class, the class began to apply for acceptance by the Central Training Corps, so the methods in the class are mostly the same as before, which is slightly different from the general methods of the Corps Headquarters. The training of scoutmasters is the most urgent task at present, and professional training should be carried out in accordance with the regulations for normal education prescribed by the Ministry of Education. Crash courses should not be easily opened. As for spiritual training and ideological training, they should be统筹managed by the Central Training Corps. Now, based on what I have seen, I have expressed them specifically. I hope that fellow comrades in the scout world across the country will not hesitate to offer their gems, think for the sake of the cause, express their opinions, in order to get a perfect method, then it will be fortunate.

The Yaqing School on the fifth floor of the Pudong Building has been operating for more than a year since it was founded with the support of famous Shanghai figures such as Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, and Yuan Ludeng last autumn. The number of students coming to study is increasing day by day, and the results are remarkable. At the 14th school affairs meeting held yesterday, it was resolved that, in order to establish the foundation of the school and to benefit deaf and mute students, it was initiated to hire famous Shanghai singers to perform a free Beijing opera performance at the Tianchan Stage on November 11 to raise a donation fund. All proceeds from the ticket sales, except for all expenses, will be transferred to the school's fund to benefit deaf and mute children.

### This Year's West Youth Basketball Tournament to Begin in Mid-Next Month; Competition Time Reduced; Qualifying Rounds to Be Held First

The 12th West Youth Invitational Basketball Tournament, hosted by the Sports Department of the West China YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road in this city, has already begun preparations and will begin in mid-next month. However, this year, the gym regulations of the Association stipulate that it is available for the league on Monday, Friday, and Saturday afternoons. The remaining time is for other sports activities. With less competition time, the number of participating teams has to be limited. It is learned that if the number of registered teams is too large, it will be decided to hold a qualifying tournament before the start of the tournament. Only the stronger teams will be formally allowed to join the league competition, and the weaker teams will be eliminated. Once the preparations are in place, registration will begin soon. Also, the new referees of the Association will be assigned to practice in the league. According to reports, the competition began in 1928, with Shanghai University and Ye Shi Team winning the championships in Groups A and B. After that, Group A became the exclusive domain of the West China YMCA, which lasted for as many as eight years (Haizhe and Xintong were both incarnations of the West China YMCA). In the previous competition, Mai Ling's officers rose to replace them. In the last competition, the Chinese giants Paramount failed at the last minute, and the championship fell into the hands of Mai Ling Hong. The competition was originally divided into two groups, A and B. Group C was added in 1934, and the University Group was added in 1936. Last year, only one group was held. This year, it will roughly follow the example of the previous competition and not divide into groups. Here are the past championship records:

### Women's Table Tennis Charity Match: Yuet Kwong Victorious, 4-3 Defeating Ching Ching; Second Encounter Tomorrow Night

In the second match, Yuet Kwong's Dai Mingna played against Qing's Zhu Huimin. The competition was extremely tense, lasting until the fifth set. Zhu eventually succumbed to exhaustion, losing 5-11 to Dai. In the third match, Yuet Kwong's Liang Yuzhen met Qing's Ling Suzhen. Ling used a steady chop shot to control the overall game, winning back a point, making the score 1-3.

Qing's Xia Xia Reverses Defeat into Victory

The fourth match, featuring Yuet Kwong's chop shot expert Lin Yunxia against Qing's topspin expert Xia Xia, was one of the most exciting moments of the night. Xia initially lost two sets but, amid the applause of the audience, won three consecutive sets, reversing the defeat into victory. The fifth match, between Yuet Kwong's Liang Huixian and Qing's team captain Tang Shufen, was as thrilling as the Lin-Xia match.

### Finance: Chips Loosen, Cash Not Easy to Rise

Yesterday's situation in the dark market for cash transactions ("烚赤") showed a weakening trend. This was due to the strengthening of foreign exchange and the concentration of negative news. Although the Hong Kong syndicate did not change its usual style, its appetite was not as strong as before. Many retail investors, seeing the unfavorable environment, had the idea of selling off. As a result, there were quite a few chips in the market, leading to a gradual loosening and downward trend. The price once nearly fell below the 4,000 yuan mark, but ultimately remained strong, only falling by a small 14 yuan. The day's initial situation was relatively stable, opening at a high price of 4,023 yuan. Subsequently, due to the strengthening of foreign exchange, there was no change. However, securities firms and retail investors had already decided to sell, and few overseas firms were buying. By the midday close, the price had fallen to 4,008 yuan. In the afternoon, news of further loosening of foreign exchange emerged, so buyers were scarce. Ultimately, due to the aggressive selling by securities firms, the market opened at a low price of 4,000 yuan. Then, due to a sudden surge of buying from the Hong Kong syndicate, short positions of securities firms were forced to cover, and the price rose by more than ten yuan. Finally, the market closed at 4,010 yuan. With the possibility of vigorous developments in the European war in the coming days, and the news of China's victory flying in like snowflakes, it is not easy to expect gold prices to rise. Trading volume was relatively light that day, only about 700 taels. Gold jewelry prices in silver shops remained unchanged throughout the day. Customs gold, etc., also remained flat.

Cash Transactions Fell Very Slightly

From the morning, the initial situation for each bar (ten taels) was relatively stable, only slightly lower than the previous day by a small amount. Money changers did 20 taels, quoted at 4,023 yuan. Shortly after, hearing that foreign exchange was slightly firmer, this triggered selling by retail investors, and silver shops also slightly hedged. The market steadily declined, falling another small 12 yuan. Cash firms sold ten taels to a certain gold shop for 4,011 yuan. After that, a certain gold shop took advantage of the low price to buy, and retail investors also showed a weakening intention to sell, causing a slight rebound. A certain gold shop purchased several dozen taels from money changers and counterparts, once raising the price to 4,018 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms suddenly began to sell, and the interest of buyers was quite weak, immediately falling another ten yuan. Gold shops sold thirty taels to money changers for 4,008 yuan. At that time, a certain money changer absorbed slightly on behalf of customers, raising the price by five yuan. A certain money changer took in twenty taels from counterparts, priced at 4,013 yuan. Nearing midday, the selling pressure from securities firms rose again, and the situation was weak again. Securities firms sold thirty taels to gold shops for 4,008 yuan as the midday closing price. In the afternoon, the initial opening was because foreign exchange was slightly firmer again, and there was a lack of buyers, actually reducing the midday closing price by eight yuan. Gold shops sold ten taels to money changers, quoted at 4,000 yuan. Later, securities firms suddenly gained profits and re-entered, plus the Hong Kong syndicate followed suit. Although silver shops took the opportunity to hedge, and money changers sold off on behalf of retail investors, the positions were still felt to be over-supplied for a time, and soon rebounded by fifteen yuan. Money changers did twenty taels, priced at 4,015 yuan. After entering, there were gradually fewer buyers, and a decline of eight yuan was immediately seen. Silver shops sold twenty taels to money changers for 4,007 yuan. At the evening close, silver shops took in dozens of taels, causing a raise of three yuan. A certain silver shop purchased ten taels from money changers, priced at 4,010 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, compared to the previous day, there was a fourteen yuan fall, a twenty-three yuan difference for the entire day. The selling price of cash firms' benchmark gold was ten yuan higher than the transaction price, and the purchase price was about thirty yuan lower. The current benchmark gold is more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and both are seldom traded.

The exchange price for gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged throughout the day, as cash transactions still had no significant changes. Datong Hang still quoted 405 yuan, and the new counterpart had the same price. The purchase price must be reduced by about 20 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Buying and Selling is Tentative; US Exchange Forward Rates Rise Sharply; Swap Points Seen

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. In the unofficial market for British-American exchange, the initial morning situation saw the British rate continue to tighten at 0.3125 because overseas American exchange for British exchange rebounded by two points. The American rate did not show any rise or fall. Although foreign banks like Chase National Bank had a bit of an appetite in the middle of the day, because Chinese banks came to sell, and negative news on the market was still strong, other buyers were quite scarce, so the trend gradually loosened and strengthened. By about 11:30 AM, both buyers and sellers were hesitant, and the situation became even quieter. In the midday closing, the American exchange was slightly firmer again, while the British gold did not change at all. In the afternoon, Chinese merchants sold off slightly, and American banks also intended to sell, so the situation was unsustainable and continued to loosen. As a result, the British rate tightened by 0.046875, and the American rate also rose by 0.09375. As for the trend in futures, because foreign banks were more inclined to sell, the current month and spot prices were seen to have flattened out, while the November term also slightly tightened. Trading volume was flat throughout the day.

The Market Situation is Very Quiet

The initial morning saw London's recent big items shrink by 25, forward rates fell by 125, New York silver prices fell by half a cent, and London's raw gold was stagnant. For exchange rates, British exchange for American, Shanghai, French, and other exchanges were all flat. American exchange for British rose by two points, for Shanghai rose by five points, and for French rose by one point three seven five. The Central Bank's listed rates for each exchange remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 4 pence 53125 for British gold and 7 yuan 53125 for American exchange. Compared to the previous close, the British slightly tightened by 0.015625, and the American did not show any rise or fall. This was because exchange rates rebounded. The initial situation was quiet after opening. Until HSBC's listed rates were announced, there was no change, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be only a small 2.5 cents. After that, Chinese banks, such as Shanghai, came to sell, and a certain bank also slightly sold off. However, foreign banks, such as Chase National Bank and Li, had a relatively good appetite, so the market situation still did not change much, only showing slight strengthening. Chinese banks sold spot British gold to Chase National Bank and Li for 4 pence 5625. Then, Shanghai and a certain bank sold spot American exchange to foreign banks for 7 yuan 5625. After 10:30 AM, fewer and fewer transactions were made, so the process was less and less exciting. Until the midday close, British gold did not change, while American exchange was slightly firmer again. British was still counted at 4 pence 5625, and American was 7 yuan 59375. Compared to the opening in the morning, British rebounded loosely by 0.03125, and American tightened by 0.0625.

There Were Slightly More Sellers in the Afternoon

The situation in the after-market was still flat, continuing to be slightly

tight. It was heard that Chinese merchants first sold spot British gold to a certain bank for 4 pence 59375. Afterwards, American banks also sold spot British gold to counterpart banks for 4 pence 59375, and spot American exchange for 7 yuan 625. Extending to the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was 4 pence 59375 for British gold and 7 yuan 625 for American exchange. The current month was the same as the previous price, and the November British gold was 4 pence 53125 and the American exchange was 7 yuan and a half. (The above prices may not be satisfactory for Chinese merchants and foreign firms, etc., to settle their accounts.) As a result, compared to the previous day, the spot British was loose by 0.046875 and the American was tight by 0.09375. The futures British rose by 0.0625 and the American sharply loosened by 0.15625.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Unchanged

Hong Kong, 17th Telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning, and exchange rates in various places did not rise or fall. At 11:30, it was stable and did not move. The Shanghai exchange fell slightly by one yuan in the afternoon, to 326 yuan. At 2:30 PM, the opening was stable and the market had no changes.

Tianjin Exchange Rate Loosens

"United Notes" in the unofficial market rose slightly by half a yuan to 85 yuan and a half.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Firm and Rising, Foreign Stocks Rebound Slightly

Yesterday's situation in the unofficial market for Unified Public Bonds, after a period of consolidation, saw a firm and rising trend again. The market atmosphere rose again because the intermittent atmosphere of peace continued to make noise in the market. Although it is not worth the attention of knowledgeable people, it inevitably aroused the excitement of ordinary, weak-willed speculators. And with the war progressing smoothly, and finance reaching the ultimate consolidation, although many beneficial atmospheres swarm to the market, many parties have successively absorbed them, and the momentum is quite vigorous. And sellers have sold off at high prices, and competition has been extremely fierce, so the market price has been obstructed from rising, only rising by 3 to 4.5 cents. The trading volume was flat, about 600,000 yuan. Overall, if there is no special stimulus in the market, it is still likely to consolidate with a rising trend.

For stocks, 200 shares of China Merchant Electric Stock were traded, priced at 5 yuan and 6 cents.

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Association of All Trades and Industries opened firmly, and after entering, it slightly softened, and prices slightly fell. The Shanghai-Hong Kong Trust stock, after deducting a dividend of 5 yuan yesterday, once rose to 62 yuan, but this price could not be held for long. It consolidated all day at a slightly lower price. Trading in Jardine Matheson Cotton Mill stock was quite brisk, but the market had no advancing trend, only revolving. The closing price fell by 5 cents compared to the highest price. International Savings Society stock was very active, but the price that rose in the early morning almost completely retreated. Yeeson Shipyard stock surged to 117 yuan, and the trading volume was extremely large. In terms of rubber stocks, several well-known stocks were relatively active. The market also tended to soften at the close. The market, after several periods of activity and pull-up, has now slightly returned to weakness, which is not surprising.

The Board of Directors of Rubber Estates of Krian, Limited, managed by Xiangmao Foreign Firm in Shanghai, decided yesterday to pay an interim dividend of 4 cents per share in national currency from October 27th, covering the one-year period ending at the end of April 1940.

### Grain: Du Japonica Rice is Stable, Passenger Indica Rice Arrivals are Scarce and Firm

There were no shipments of rice from the lower reaches of the river.

New goods, such as Car Wheel Baozi, Lai Su, and Kunfengjia, totaled more than 4,000 bags. Early morning sales to local routes were still active, so the passenger's sentiment remained firm. The price of each product was uniformly shouted up by 3 to 5 cents. By midday, wholesale sales were weak again, and the market tended to be flat, so the closing market price was tight first and weak later, resulting in a set result. Changxi special grade broken rice traded at 32 yuan, Gao 30 yuan, second grade 27 yuan. Su Tongchang Kun white broken rice ranged from 27 yuan to 25-26 yuan, new Japonica high 28 yuan, city 26 yuan, decided to 24 yuan. Qingjiao kiln seeds lacked goods and had no market. Fenjia Baige high 28 yuan, decided to 26 yuan and a half, special Yangjian 23 yuan and 2 cents, to 21 yuan and a half, Lushanjian special 23 yuan 6-7 cents to 22 yuan, Jiangbei Jian 19 yuan 2-3 cents to 19 yuan, Nanjing special Jian 19 yuan 8 cents, high 19 yuan shouted 5 cents, middle city 19 yuan, Wuhu special Jian 19 yuan 5 cents, city 19 yuan, middle 18 yuan 8 cents, second to 18 yuan 3 cents, Jian 17 yuan 7 cents to 17 yuan and a half, old 31 yuan to 30 yuan, new white 25-26 yuan, Unified city transaction totaled tens of thousands of bags.

Another message: Continuous Japanese passenger sales are gradually booming.

Yesterday's market continued to see progress, although the municipal inventory was still sufficient. The northern Jiangsu Indica rice has already stopped handling due to insufficient cost, and recent arrivals have gradually decreased. The number of arrivals of Jing Wu Indica rice in recent days has also decreased. Japanese merchants also lack complete batch sales. Yesterday, due to rumors of purchasing certificate issues, people's hearts turned upward, and shops in rural villages in the interior had undiminished demand. Prices rose again by 2-3-4 cents. Jing Wu top Indica rice opened at 20 yuan 034 cents. The market price was around 19 yuan and a half, a middle-end decision of 18 yuan and a half to around 18 yuan. Rice 17-18 yuan, brown rice around 16 yuan.

### Flour Prices Turn Stable, Wheat Rises Another Two Cents

Flour: Yesterday's current flour mill prices turned into a set situation, with authentic No. 2 flour continuing to open at 7 yuan and 2 cents in cash. The market for recycled goods also tended to be peaceful, because the sales of both the northern and southern syndicates were slightly weak, and they all had the intention of handling small amounts again, so the market was less excited. Warship brand transit goods continued to open above 7 yuan and 1 cent. The old car and Red Blue Fuxin brands' transit orders were similar to the mill prices. The entire market transaction totaled 30-40,000 bags. It was heard that the Japanese factory's Phoenix brand flour was also being dumped by hoarders, and the price fell back to 6 yuan 8 cents 4-5 cents. 4,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong today, and another 2,000 bags were shipped to Singapore.

Wheat: Yesterday, wheat continued to be strong, because after a sharp rise once the day before, people's hearts were quite excited, and they all intended to sell at a good price. The mill and hoarders both had a weak buying appetite. The Fuxin Fufeng mills together handled 1,500 bags, and the hoarders handled only one or two cars. The highest price was 10 yuan and 3 cents, an increase of about two cents compared to before.

### Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Multi-Headedness Less Exciting, Market Falling Still Slow

The yarn market feels even more sluggish, and the situation does not deviate from a hovering realm. The needs of the Hong Kong and mainland syndicates are slightly more lively, but the amounts of purchases are minimal, so the hearts of the market could not be lifted. General speculators, seeing the poor environment, are unfavorable for the multi-headed party, and have little excitement for buying. But the amounts hoarded by the general wealthy people have not been released, so although the actual need is stagnant, the number of chips feels even more increased. The market falling is still slow.

The current yarn's morning opening is still scattered and weak.

At the beginning of the opening, 50 bags of 20-count Tiannv spot goods were transacted, priced at 679 yuan, which was a transaction between counterparts. Although other brokers were shouting, there were very few buyers. There were even more sellers of Double Horse, but eaters were slow to appear. After a long time of delay, the spot opening price was 712 yuan, falling by 1 yuan. The transit order price was 697 yuan, but it was all temporary grab-a-cap nature. By the closing, it was seen that 2-3 yuan was falling off again. It was found that 1,308 bags were traded in half a day. The market price for 20-count Double Horse fell by 4 yuan, Tiannv rose by 5 yuan, and Double Earth rose by 2 yuan. The factory opened 200 bags of 10-count Jiahe from the Wing On Factory, priced at 530 yuan. 70 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amounts bought by each syndicate are listed on the left.

### Cotton Buying and Selling: Counterparts Comparatively Active

Transactions in local cotton were smoother than before. Japanese factories

slightly needed white cotton. As for the Chinese factories, in addition to the new purchase from Xinsheng, other yarn factories had little energy. However, the entry and exit of counterparts has become more active. The selling price is still stable. The incoming cotton from northern Jiangsu is still maintainable. 2,088 bags of Tongzhou cotton arrived, 350 pieces of north sand cotton, and no arrival of Changyinsha cotton has been heard of. There were 495 pieces shipped to Hong Kong today. The current cotton selling prices and bag amounts are listed on the left.

Another message: Transactions of foreign cotton in Shanghai have seen no progress recently due to the stagnation of exchange rates. Factories quietly hold their hopes. Counterparts also do not want to handle it because of this, so transactions are very quiet. Recent arrivals of Tongzhou cotton have been crowded, which is the factory's main reason for holding a wait-and-see attitude.

The market price for foreign cotton: The New York cotton market was quite firm in the early morning, and appeared to be active. Domestic factory needs have also gradually become smoother. The sales of cloth have also shown improvement, so this triggered the purchase of counterparts and the offsetting of some short positions. Until the closing, the market price rose 5-6 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian, including forecasts, rose by two rupees, Egyptian fell by 30 pounds, and Liverpool fell by four pence.

### Textiles: Cotton Cloth Hand Goods Sold Off at Cheap Prices

The market for cloth saw slight development in the current sales of local and foreign syndicates, and the market has stabilized. However, scattered retail goods were sold off at loose prices, and the market for some of the cloths continued to decline, and prices were quite chaotic. The price of white goods, light and heavy weight coarse cloth, fell by 5 cents to 1.5 cents per bolt. There was very little trading in fine cloth and fine twill, falling by 2 cents per bolt. The market for bleached and dyed cloth and flannel was stable, and a small number still had cheap prices. In addition to the continued allocation of goods for actual needs, local street wholesale shops have very little interest. In addition to shipping scheduled goods, the Guangdong syndicate has no new purchasing appetite. The Yong syndicate handled over 100 pieces of light and heavy weight coarse cloth and printed flannel. The Fujian syndicate handled 30-40 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and fine cloth. The purchasing appetite in foreign regions such as Mumbai, Cebu, and Singapore is still healthy. The transaction of red foreign standard, printed cloth, and satin totaled over 4,000 bolts.

Yesterday, white goods and colored goods in Dong 疋 first fell and then rebounded, resulting in stable. The leading fine cloth sold at a low price of over 20 yuan in the morning market. The after-market rebounded to 20 yuan 02.5 cents. Four Gentlemen serge fell to 6 cents 3.5 cents per yard, and also rebounded to 6 cents 4.5 cents, because the foreign firm's opening price was still high, and the northern syndicate had a little purchasing interest, and the counterparts' sentiment tended to stabilize slightly. It was heard that traders made about 400 pieces of fine cloth in total. The monthly contracted opening price for Leading Brand was 20 yuan 05 cents per bolt, and the next month's was 20 yuan 07.5 cents. Qinhuangdao had healthier intake from the northern sales, and over 300 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill were traded. The Tianjin syndicate handled over 200 pieces. Local dye factories also took in 3-400 pieces.

40 pieces of export cloth were shipped to Singapore today, another 450 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 185 pieces were shipped to Haiphong.

### Ignoring Expensive Prices, Woolen Business is Particularly Booming

Woolen serge is still rising straight ahead. Not only the autumn and winter goods currently needed for sale, but also the goods needed for sale in the spring and summer of the coming year, are regarded as rare goods. What is strange is that although the price of goods is soaring, the sales route is still not weak. Even the isolated islands at sea have prosperous sales, which surpass the pre-war level. If you bought woolen serge clothing materials at this time last year, you could get high-quality western goods of full wool for 1 yuan 3-4 cents per foot. If you were thrifty, you could buy cut towel woven goods for over 7 cents per foot. Now, the most basic, unsightly goods must be sold for 1 yuan 1-2 cents per foot. If you want to get high-quality, full-wool western goods, you must pay more than 3 yuan per foot. It used to cost about 45 yuan per set to custom-make western suits at western clothing stores. Even if you wear rough clothing, it is not inferior. Now it costs 60 yuan a set, and the lining is not as good as it used to be. Also, it used to cost over 70 yuan to order a long-haired wool female overcoat, but now it is difficult to do without more than 100 yuan. This shows the general rise in woolen goods.

### Oil Cake: Speculative Manipulation, Soybean Oil Raises Madly to 70 Yuan

Yesterday's soybean oil market situation created a shocking new record. In the morning, carrying on the momentum of the previous day, and with people's hearts already tense, the opening jumped by 1.5 yuan. In the afternoon, a general manipulator violently pulled up the price, and large households added fuel to the fire, creating an unprecedentedly high price. Kobe oil closed at 70 yuan, 150 barrels of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at 50 yuan, 10 pieces of Qingqi oil were traded at 50 yuan 05 cents, 50 pieces of Yanqi oil were also traded at 50 yuan 05 cents, 10 barrels of white squeezed oil were priced at 65 yuan, and 500 cans of white squeezed oil were priced at 65 yuan 5 cents. 180 cans of Wenzhou oil were priced at 63 yuan 5 cents. The above transactions were completely mutual transfers, and actual sales were reduced, because the local market price in Xichang and other places was lower than the Shanghai market due to the fact that various factories had goods available for sale, so the soaring price yesterday could not be sustained, and it is predicted that there will be a sharp setback. It was found that 1,080 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong today, and 380 bags of raw kernels, 600 bags of soybeans, and 2,000 blocks of soybean cake were shipped to Hong Kong and then to Singapore. 1,950 bags of soybeans and 2,000 blocks of bean cake.

### Miscellaneous: Market Summary

US Dollar Notes Fall Slightly by One Cent Three: Yesterday's foreign currency market, with the exchange market trending towards a looser trend, was less sustainable. It once fell to 13 yuan 2 cents, and finally closed at 13 yuan 2 cents 5 cents. As a result, it continued to fall slightly by one cent and three cents compared to the previous day. Canadian notes and Australian gold notes tended to be soft. The former fell by 1 yuan, and the latter also fell by 1 yuan 5 cents. Japanese gold notes continued to fall by 3 cents. The Korean notes' falling trend was even stronger, falling by 2.5 cents compared to the previous day, priced at 1 yuan 1 cent 2 cents. Only Singapore notes rose by 1 cent, and the rest remained unchanged.

Ginkgo nut's high price fell back by more than half: Ginkgo nuts fell in price because of poor harvest. When new products first appeared, Hong Kong syndicate was willing to purchase at high prices, once up to 60-70 yuan. But as the number of arrivals increased recently, the number of consumers decreased. Prices dropped step by step, with the lowest being only 28-29 yuan. The current market price is around 30 yuan.

### The Shanghai Western District Extra-Settlement Road Construction Issue to Be Resolved by the Consular Body; Tax Collection Problems Seem to Be the Crux of the Case; the Puppet Regime's Collection of Taxes Has Already Encountered Some Obstacles

According to the French-language "Shanghai Daily" on the 17th, the Public Works Department (PWD) of the Public Concession announced that its dispute with the "Special Municipality of Shanghai" regarding roads outside the settlement will be handed over to the Shanghai Consular Body for resolution. According to the PWD, the biggest point of contention in this case is not only the police authority issue, but also the tax revenue issue. All the houses along these extra-settlement roads enjoy the benefits of the PWD's public utilities. Therefore, the matter should be handed over to the Consular Body for resolution. The PWD has already complained to the Shanghai Consular Body about the various overstepping behaviors of the puppet municipal government in building roads outside the settlement in the western district, as well as its attempts to seize the tax revenue of the concession authorities. Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Fessenden, Director-General and Chairman of the PWD, to ask for his opinion.

Hoping Residents Will Pay Taxes to the PWD

Mr. Fessenden replied that the PWD hopes that residents on the extra-settlement roads will continue to pay taxes to the PWD, but does not want to take any direct action. The dispute over the matter has been submitted to the Consular Body for handling. The reporter then asked if the PWD would advise residents on the extra-settlement roads to refuse to pay taxes to other agencies. Mr. Fessenden said that he was very sorry and could not answer this question.

Date of Consular Body Meeting Undecided

The reporter also learned from the Shanghai Municipal Council that the Consular Body has not yet set a date for a meeting to discuss the extra-settlement road issue. At present, the consuls-general of the countries concerned with the Public Concession are only studying it individually.

Chinese Are the Most Affected

However, in the current situation, the collection of taxes by the puppet municipal government in the extra-settlement road area affects Chinese residents the most. Because Western residents in the area are protected by their respective consuls, they can refuse to pay taxes to any agency other than the PWD. Therefore, the puppet municipal government's financial bureau's attempts to collect house and land taxes from foreign residents in the extra-settlement road area have been met with closed doors. However, according to Western opinions, Chinese residents in the area have no place to appeal because there is no Chinese government authority here at present. This is the crux of the extra-settlement road tax issue.

Difficulties Arise Due to Foreign Opposition

The "North China Daily News" reported a message published in the Japanese-run "New Shanghai News," stating that the "municipal government" of Shanghai's collection of a "municipal tax" in the western district extra-settlement road area has encountered difficulties due to the relationship between foreign residents and foreign business managers. The newspaper acknowledged that the director of the "Western District Tax Collection Office" has requested the "municipal government's diplomatic department" to continue negotiations with the Public Concession authorities. The purpose of the negotiations is to enable the "municipal government" to collect taxes from foreigners living and doing business in the area.

Poor Results in Collecting House Taxes

The newspaper also said that "the municipal government began collecting house taxes in a very limited area of the district from March of this year. After consultation, it was able to collect more house taxes in a larger area. So far, 20,000 yuan in house taxes have been collected. It has been difficult to collect taxes from residents of Yu Garden Road and locations lacking public utilities, but these problems have been resolved. As for the collection of taxes from foreigners in the district, Mr. Zhu, the "Director of the Tax Collection Office," recently requested the "municipal government" to consult with the Public Concession authorities to resolve this problem." According to reports, when the "municipal government" wanted to collect "winter house taxes" a few weeks ago, it announced that foreigners should also pay taxes.

Rumor of New Instructions Received by US Authorities

Foreign news: The various illegal actions taken by the Japanese in the concession recently have aroused serious attention from the consulates. After a certain foreigner telegraphed his government in detail, he has now received new instructions to make statements about the illegal actions of the Japanese. There will be new developments in the coming days.

### New Taikoo Steamer Passengers; More Than Three Hundred People Died; Turning Around Against the Wind Caused Sinking in Less Than Five Minutes; Japanese Shipowner's Lack of Experience Led to the Disaster

The two ships, Taikoo No. 18 Maru and New Taikoo Maru, belonging to the Japanese-owned Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, were operating on the Xinkou (Jingjiang County) line. The New Taikoo Maru left Xinkou for Shanghai (mistakenly stated as exiting) on the morning of the 16th, fully loaded with cargo and carrying more than 400 passengers, exceeding the prescribed number. When it reached a point 12 nautical miles from the mouth of the Wusong River, near the lighthouse, the wind was strong and the waves were high. Because the passengers and cargo were overloaded, the ship could not withstand the wind and waves. The Japanese shipowner, in an attempt to save the situation, steered the ship close to the shallow waters to avoid capsizing. Unexpectedly, the bow of the ship turned to the right and was hit hard by the wind and waves. The ship then tilted to the right and capsized. In less than five minutes, the ship and cargo were completely submerged, and all the passengers were drowned. Ten minutes later, the wind and waves gradually subsided.

More Than Three Hundred Passengers Died

Although a Japanese merchant's tugboat, carrying two pig barges, and the Anhe and Hanhe ships passed by during the sinking, they were unable to provide assistance due to the strong wind and waves and the fact that they were fully loaded. Yesterday's report that the Hanhe ship rescued more than 60 people was completely misinformation. Of the more than 400 passengers, only 49 people were rescued by the Japanese warship Yixian, which was seized by the Japanese and dispatched urgently after the incident, and 18 people were rescued by a certain Japanese ship. The rest are feared to have been completely buried in the bellies of fish. One of the rescued women died from drinking too much water. Among the crew, two Japanese, one the shipowner and the other the chief mate, also drowned. Nisshin Kisen Kaisha immediately dispatched the Seizan Maru to the scene of the incident for rescue after receiving the report the day before yesterday. It returned to Shanghai that night without any results. It is said that the Japanese transport ship Kyobashi Maru also brought 17 rescued passengers yesterday morning, and a small ship also rescued 20 passengers. They all landed at Yangshupu.

Customs Warns Vessels to Pay Attention

As the ship sank in a major traffic route, the Jianghai Customs issued a warning yesterday morning, advising all vessels to pay special attention when passing the sunken ship to avoid accidentally touching it and causing an accident. At the same time, several of the Customs' lifeboats were dispatched to the scene for rescue, but the ship had completely sunk into the water, so rescue was impossible.

Total Loss of the Ship Exceeds One Million

It is understood that the New Taikoo ship had a load capacity of 108 tons and a length of 85 feet. The shipowner was a Japanese named Nomo. There were more than 20 Japanese crew members on the ship (all of whom are now missing). It was loaded with a large number of cotton and groceries, worth more than 110,000 yuan. The total loss of the ship is more than 1 million yuan. Yesterday, Mr. Yamanaka and others from the East Asia Shipping Association also went to the scene of the incident by boat to investigate and are currently handling the aftermath.

### Shanghai Public Organizations to Welcome Philippine Vice President Today; China-Philippines Relations Have Always Been Cordial; Special Reception to Be Held at the International Hotel

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the Chinese Industrial Association, and the International Affairs Research Association have decided to hold a tea party at the International Hotel at 4:00 PM today to welcome Philippine Vice President Osmeña, who is returning home via Shanghai, in view of the cordial relations between China and the Philippines. At that time, Mr. Lin Chao-pin, Manager of Huafei Tobacco Company, Mr. Wang Tian-shen, Manager of Chung Hsing Bank, and Mr. Hu Gui-geng, Manager of Tiger Balm Yong An Tang, will be invited to accompany him. It is said that the International Affairs Research Association is generally responsible for the reception matters.

### No Confirmation of Second Batch of Fractional Currency Issuance

Three-Cent Tram Tickets Valid

Until the 20th

After the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank issued one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes, in order to prevent large quantities from flowing into the occupied areas, it solemnly issued them, limiting each household to 20 yuan. In recent days, many companies and firms have been applying for exchange, and more than 450,000 yuan has been issued. It is expected that the planned 500,000 yuan will be issued completely within this week. It is learned that after the head office ordered the Hong Kong office to sign a printing contract with the American-owned Wing On Company for the second batch of 500,000 yuan,

When Will Printing Be Completed?

Shipping to Shanghai for issuance was not completed by last night, according to the head office's telegram. Rumors that printing has been completed, shipping to Shanghai, and issuing at the end of the month, as well as the additional issuance of two-cent notes, are probably not true. As for the fractional currency notes issued by the Zhejiang Provincial Bank, there are three types: one-cent, two-cent, and five-cent, which are used exclusively in the interior of Zhejiang Province. Although those holding these fractional currency notes can cash them at the Shanghai Branch of the Zhejiang Provincial Bank, they are not issued in Shanghai. It is also rumored that counterfeit five-cent notes of the Central Bank's fractional currency have been discovered. The bank has denied this, saying that a person recently requested the identification of the authenticity of a five-cent note. The bank

Identified as Genuine

Because the note had been soaked in water, it was blurred and unclear. Because the fractional currency note has a ground pattern, counterfeiting is very difficult. In addition, the various denomination value tickets issued by the two tram companies in the city have flowed into the hands of the people in extremely large numbers. However, because they have been in common use for a long time, many are broken and unusable. In addition, the Central Bank's new notes have already been fully circulated on the market. In fact, for this type of denomination tickets

No Longer Needed

The two companies have formally notified all ticket sellers to recover them in full. Those who have accumulated many can directly exchange them at the two companies. It is also learned that the Public Concession tram company issued a three-cent denomination ticket, which was originally planned to be withdrawn immediately due to the discovery of counterfeit tickets being mixed in. However, because change was needed, the deadline was specially extended to the 20th of this month (i.e., the day after tomorrow). Citizens who have any of these tickets remaining should exchange them at the company as soon as possible, so as to avoid being refused acceptance after the deadline.

### Local Weather Turns Sunny; Hurricane Approaching Japan

After the drastic change in the local weather, the rain and wind stopped the night before last. The weather turned sunny and cool yesterday morning. However, the waterlogged low-lying roads have not yet receded. It was also found that there was another high tide in the Huangpu River yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. At that time, the low-lying roads and sewers overflowed again. The Pacific hurricane passed over the sea east of Shanghai and continued to move in a north-easterly direction. This morning, it had extended to the sea off the southern suburbs of Japan, and the wind force was very strong.

### Shanghai Women's Community Initiates Campaign to Collect 100,000 Sets of Winter Clothing; 50,000 Sets to Be Collected and 50,000 Sets to Be Made, to Be Collected Before the End of November

The women's community in this city, in view of the gradually cold weather and the lack of winter clothing for women, children, and refugees, urgently needs relief. Therefore, a meeting was held at the YMCA a few days ago to discuss the campaign to collect winter clothing and the voluntary making of winter clothing. It was decided to collect 50,000 sets of winter clothing and make 50,000 sets of winter clothing, a total of 100,000 sets. The funds for making winter clothing will be raised by the representatives attending the meeting, and they must be collected before the end of November. After they are made, they will be distributed to various refugee relief organizations for use.

### Panic Among Residents After Japanese Post Boundary Markers; Migration Intensifies, Empty Houses Increase; East of North Jiangxi Road, Vehicles Are Prohibited

At the junction of North Henan Road and Bazilu in Area A north of Suzhou Creek, the Japanese army added boundary markers to the wall of the Delong Cigarette Factory the day before yesterday, intending to completely distinguish the boundary between the British and Japanese defense forces from south to north. Starting yesterday, residents of the alleys and lanes on Bazilu started migrating again. The cityscape along North Jiangxi Road has become increasingly desolate in recent days, and industrial and commercial operations have suffered severely. The details are as follows:

Boundary Markers Added at the Bazilu Intersection

In the area east of North Henan Road in Area A, since the Japanese army took over defense, the Japanese army has automatically erected boundary markers along the various crossroad intersections along North Henan Road from Tianhou Palace Bridge to Bazilu, with the words "Boundary Line of British and Japanese Guarded Area" written on them. However, no boundary marker was erected at the Delong Cigarette Factory north of Bazilu. The Japanese army added a boundary marker to the wall of the cigarette factory the day before yesterday. Many parties are unclear about its intentions. According to sources, the intention of the Japanese army in adding the boundary marker is to completely distinguish the boundary between the British and Japanese defense forces from south to north, and there is no other purpose.

Migration of Residents Intensifies

Bazilu at the end of North Jiangxi Road is less than 100 meters long and has many city houses and lanes. Since the area was changed to a Japanese army guarded area, it has caused panic among the residents, and they have been moving out one after another. At present, there are fewer than 40% of the residents than before. Now that the Japanese army has added boundary markers, it is feared that there will be other unfavorable actions. Therefore, starting yesterday, the migration trend on Bazilu intensified. Until the evening, those carrying suitcases and luggage were still continuously on the road. Everywhere there were notices posted in red paper for renting, selling, and subletting. The feeling was that people were leaving and the buildings were emptying out.

Desolate Cityscape in the Japanese Guarded Area

The area from the northern end of Tianhou Palace Bridge to the end of North Jiangxi Road Bridge to Bazilu has become a Japanese defense force guarded area. Before the defense area changed, the entire cityscape of each section was extremely prosperous, and there were also many residents. Now that it has been changed to Japanese control, the comings and goings of pedestrians are often interfered with, and residents are also subject to searches. Regardless of whether they are people inside or outside the area, all consider the area a dangerous place and are unwilling to enter or leave the area unless necessary. Therefore, the extremely prosperous environment has suddenly turned into a dead city that is extremely desolate.

Vehicles Prohibited East of Jiangxi Road

The situation in Area A north of Suzhou Creek is still stagnant. In addition to occasionally re-encrypting and sealing the barbed wire at the Bazilu intersection on North Jiangxi Road, the Japanese do not station sentries. The inspection of passes is stricter when residents pass through the two gaps in Haining Road and Wenshi Road, but there are no searches or interrogations. However, vehicles are prohibited from entering the locked line east of North Jiangxi Road.

### Weather Clears, Rain Stops; Rice Prices Expected to Fall

Continuous Rainy Days Cause Slight Price Increase

Shipments to Shanghai Continuous, No Fear of Shortages

News from the rice shops and tea gatherings: The source of Wuhu national rice has been cleared. Rice shipments to Shanghai from Jiaxing, Kunshan, Tongli, and Nangang are continuous. Yesterday, due to the continuous heavy rain and the difficulty in transporting, the rice market saw a slight rebound in prices of about 5-6 cents. However, according to the rice industry, this was expected and inevitable. If the weather clears and the rain stops, the source can still be transported continuously. At that time, rice prices are expected to continue to fall. It is predicted that粳秈 rice will fall and not rise. The "Temporary Trading Rules" of the rice shop tea market have been implemented. The brokers' shop representatives in the market conduct transactions in accordance with the newly established rules, and are not allowed to buy or sell short. The Rice Industry Trade Association is scheduled to hold a committee meeting at the association's office on Shanhai Pass Road at 3:00 PM this afternoon. At that time, two committee members will be appointed to participate in the market mediation committee.

### Wenzhou Cargo Cannot Be Transported to Shanghai

Too Expensive to Transfer from Zhenhai

Since the Shanghai-Wenzhou traffic was blocked by the Japanese warships, and foreign vessels were prohibited from entering and exiting, the Ou River navigation was interrupted, resulting in a large number of goods that merchants had previously ordered in Wenzhou and could not be transported to Shanghai being piled up near Aotou. It is planned to transfer them to Shanghai from Zhenhai after the issue of foreign exchange settlement for local goods transported to Shanghai is resolved. However, after a reporter inquired about the results of a certain shipping magnate's inquiry, it was believed that it would be difficult to realize the transfer of goods from Aotou to Shanghai via Zhenhai, because the transportation cost will increase several times, and merchants may not be able to bear it. In addition, although the Portuguese consul has repeatedly negotiated for the release of the twelve Portuguese ships detained by the Japanese, there is still no hope of release. The Japanese have not used the ships and are still detaining them on the Jiangmian near the Yushi Wharf. It is rumored that the Japanese intend to cooperate with the Portuguese merchants, but the main condition for cooperation is to raise the Japanese flag, which the Portuguese consul does not agree to.

### Major Backley Goes to Hong Kong and then Chongqing

To Handle Relief Work in the Inland

The Shanghai International Relief Committee held a tea party at the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge the night before last to bid farewell to Salvation Army Major Backley. Lin Kanghou, Bao Xuewen, Li Guiyong, Zhao Jinqing, Wen Lanting, Guan Jiongzhi, Zhu Yinjiang, Liu Tingfang, Zhang Lanping, Lu Ganchen, Mao Liqing, and others attended. During the meeting, Chairman Bao Xuewen gave a farewell speech and presented the major with a commemorative flag inscribed with "Helping the Weak and Supporting the Downtrodden" on behalf of the colleagues. It was decided that Lin Kanghou, Mao Liqing, Li Guiyong, Guan Jiongzhi, and others would speak in succession. Finally, Major Backley gave a reply. Major Backley left Shanghai with several of his comrades for Hong Kong yesterday morning and then went to Chongqing to join his comrades in the Yu and Rong areas to continue to handle relief work.

### Ralph Returns Home Today

Retirement Upon Expiration of Term Has Been Approved

Mr. Ralph, Superintendent of the Police Department, applied to the Public Works Department for retirement last Sunday, as he had been in office for twenty-five and a half years, and the application has been approved by his superiors. Mr. and Mrs. Ralph are scheduled to take a ship to Australia via Japan today. In addition to being publicly entertained by Inspector-General D'Enin and Western detectives on the evening of the 13th, Mr. Ralph has been busy with banquets and farewells in recent days. On the evening of the 16th, he also attended a public farewell banquet by all the members of the Western Shipping Club, and was presented with a silver cigarette case jointly presented by the members and a silver shield from the department as a souvenir by Mr. Mike, the chairman of the club.

### Hand Grenades Found in Empty House

At No. 506 Bazilu

No. 506 Bazilu at the end of North Henan Road used to be a merchant's shop. Because it was a war zone and faced the barbed wire, it has been closed since the war and no one has moved in to live there. On the afternoon of the 16th, at about 3:00 PM, the storm and rain blew down the row of doors. Suddenly, it was discovered that there were sandbag fortifications piled up inside the doors, and a hand grenade was conspicuously placed on the sandbags. Although the door faces Area A north of Suzhou Creek, it is blocked by barbed wire, so the Japanese have not yet discovered it. As of yesterday, the hand grenade was still placed in its original position. If children were ignorant and accidentally triggered it, it would be very dangerous.

### Tianjin Shipping Almost Entirely Seized

Most of the foreign merchants' North China shipping has been seized. Since Tianjin and Gu were blockaded, and then the flood caused a disaster, shipping was completely suspended. At the beginning of last month, the flood receded. Due to the lack of food in Tianjin, flour and groceries were shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin, and transportation slightly recovered. Unexpectedly, at the end of last month, the Baihe barges were incited by someone and went on strike, which has not been resolved. As a result, the cargo transport of foreign merchants has been hit again. The two British ships, Yuezhou and Hunan, left for Tianjin the day before yesterday (the 16th). Except for the Yuezhou ship, which was loaded with 70 boxes of beer and more than 100 pieces of cigarettes from the British-American Tobacco Company, there was no other cargo. The Hunan ship had a little Yantai cargo, but no Tianjin cargo at all. The Japanese ship Tangshan Maru will export to Tianjin this afternoon, fully loaded with passengers and cargo. Since Japanese ships can go directly to the Tianjin Wharf, many pieces of cargo are reported. In this situation, the future of the transportation of foreign merchant ships sailing on the North China Sea route is really unimaginable.

### Public Works Department Police Inspection Rescheduled

Mr. Fan Keling, Chairman of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, believes that as winter is approaching, the defense of this city must be strengthened to maintain security within the concession and protect public tranquility. In order to understand the police force of the various police stations under his jurisdiction, the original overall inspection of all police personnel, scheduled for 11:00 AM on the 19th of this month, has been rescheduled to November 5th due to venue reasons. It will still be held at the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road. At that time, all police officers of all ranks and all Chinese and Indian constables will participate in the inspection, and members of the Chinese and Western Board of Directors of the Public Works Department and senior officials stationed in Shanghai from various countries will be invited to observe and accompany the inspection.

### Japanese Merchants Collecting Cocoons Ambushed by Guerrillas; Trapped in a Small Farmhouse for Fifteen Hours; Two Dead and Three Wounded in the Puppet Pacification Corps

According to the English-language "Ta Mei Evening News," three Japanese merchants, 13 Chinese soldiers from the Pacification Corps, and 5 Japanese soldiers were surrounded by Chinese guerrillas in a small farmhouse near Suzhou in the Changshu area at the end of last month. After fifteen hours, reinforcements arrived to relieve the siege. Two members of the Pacification Corps died, three were wounded, and one was missing. The three Japanese merchants were employees of the Changshu branch of the China Silk Company. On September 26, they went to Huangzhuang (transliteration), northwest of Changshu, to purchase cocoons. They were accompanied by 30 soldiers from the Pacification Corps and 50 Japanese soldiers stationed in Yangjianzhen, south of Huangzhuang. However, after the purchase in Huangzhuang was completed, 17 soldiers from the Pacification Corps returned to defend first. While on their way back, they were suddenly attacked by guerrillas shortly after noon. Fighting immediately broke out. The guerrillas were more numerous, and the group of Japanese and others finally took refuge in a farmhouse. The guerrillas pursued them and attacked the farmhouse with machine guns and hand grenades. The Japanese and others defended to the death. By 6:00 AM the next morning, reinforcements arrived, and the guerrillas withdrew.

### British China Relief Fund: Two-Year Work Report (1)

Fund Launch

Shortly after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, many British men and women felt compelled to take action to alleviate the great suffering of numerous refugees. On August 28th of that year, the Joint Committee of the British Chamber of Commerce and the China Association discussed this issue and sent a telegram to London, urging the establishment of a refugee relief fund in London. In September, further steps were taken to promote this cause, and in early October, the launch of the fund was announced. The China Association (an organization formed by those with commercial interests in China), the British Red Cross, and the Conference of British Missionary Societies (representing various British Protestant church groups) resolved in London to establish a joint committee. In October of the same year, they officially

Began Solicitation

to raise the "Lord Mayor of London's Fund for Relief of Distress in China." The Lord Mayor of London provided assistance, and it was quickly discovered that sympathy for the suffering of the Chinese people was widespread. Local committees had been established in various cities and towns in conjunction with the Lord Mayor of London's Fund. These committees were established in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Sheffield, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Hull, and other places, mostly with the local mayor serving as chairman or actively supporting them. A committee for the collection and dispatch of clothing and medicine had also been established in London.

Subcommittee

British shipping companies such as Blue Funnel, Ben Line, Glen Line, and Shire Line all provided free transportation of all medicines and clothing. After the fund had been operating for more than a year, the Lord Mayor's Fund ended, so while the "Lord Mayor of London's Fund" was often mentioned, it was no longer able to be referred to by that name. Instead, fundraising continued under the name "British China Relief Fund." Following the recent outbreak of the European War, the British Foundation announced that it would continue its efforts. The total amount raised was 202,000 pounds, which was quite

Inspiring

A central administrative committee has been established in China to handle the work. The director of the committee is the British Ambassador and the Governor of Hong Kong, who are actively concerned about this charitable work. The chairman is Sir Philip, the British Consul-General, and the vice-chairman is Sir Marshall, the chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce. Despite their busy official duties, they have devoted their time for the past two years, working diligently with other members of the committee. Subcommittees chaired by the British Consul-General or Consul have been established in Tianjin, Qingdao, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Hankou, Chongqing, Kunming, and Hong Kong, while

Yichang and Xi'an

have also organized local committees. These subcommittees report their needs and the funds they receive to the central administrative committee in Shanghai. The central administrative committee then distributes the funds and supplies to agencies that directly manage refugee camps and hospitals for the wounded, such as the International Red Cross, churches of different denominations and nationalities, and the Salvation Army. The central administrative committee has four subcommittees to handle the work related to Chinese refugees, hospital supplies, injured British citizens, and injured people of various nationalities. Hong Kong has a committee for the distribution of medicines. In the past two years, the central administrative committee has met regularly and has hardly turned a deaf ear to appeals for assistance.

Dispatch of Materials: The Sheffield Stainless Steel Manufacturers' Association donated stainless steel knives and scissors worth 1,000 pounds. Major British pharmaceutical manufacturers donated anesthetics, medicines, clothing, and food. A certain trading company donated cotton cloth. From January 15th to August 17th, 1939, fifty shipments of materials arrived in Hong Kong from the UK, including clothing, hospital supplies, blankets, linen, soap, disinfectants, bandages, first aid kits, milk, food, medicine, mosquito nets, kettles, etc., packed in a total of 3,119 cases, packages, and boxes, worth several thousand pounds. Unpacking and redistributing these supplies in Shanghai and Hong Kong took a lot of time. A large quantity of medical supplies was also purchased in China and sent to various hospitals. In April 1939, malaria spread in Hankou, and the stock of quinine was dwindling. The British Fund provided assistance by immediately transporting quinine to Hankou. (To be continued)

### "De Yao" Wheel Has Been Officially Detained

The Japanese side handed over the navy for handling

The Japanese flag was raised yesterday morning

The "De Yao" wheel, represented by the Portuguese merchant Yihua Foreign Company, was detained by the Japanese naval police. Although the Portuguese Consul-General and the wheel authorities negotiated, there was once news that it could be released and resumed sailing. However, after many days, it has not been implemented. Now the company feels that the detention has caused huge losses and urgently needs to find a reasonable solution to resume business as soon as possible. It is heard that the Japanese side has handed over this matter to the Japanese Navy stationed in Shanghai for handling, so the future of negotiations is even more difficult. According to the reporter of Daguang News Agency who inquired from the shipping industry, the "De Yao" wheel was officially detained by the Japanese Navy authorities at 10:30 yesterday morning. The Portuguese flag on the ship has been removed and replaced with the Japanese flag. According to the Japanese Navy, the nationality of the wheel has been verified and is entirely owned by Chinese merchants, so it is officially detained. It is heard that from today, the wheel will be moved to the Yangshupu floating hole and moored with the detained Portuguese wheels. According to Daguang News Agency, the sudden investigation and detention of the "De Yao" wheel was entirely caused by the manipulation of Italian merchants.

### Puppet Drama: Fake Police Suffering

The English "Da Mei Evening News" stated that yesterday (the 16th), Xiao'an celebrated the anniversary of the "establishment of the municipal government." In the afternoon, there were many Dadao police and marchers outside Zhaofeng Park, standing in the wind and rain, looking very frustrated. According to a Dadao policeman, "We have not been issued raincoats, nor can we afford to buy them ourselves, because we only get sixteen yuan a month." According to one of the marchers, "I am a firm

Supporter of Chiang Kai-shek.

You should know why I am doing this." It is understood that these marchers are all workers from the Hongkou and Yangshupu yarn factories. The Japanese threatened them that if they did not participate in the celebration, they would be dismissed. The Japanese also promised to give each participant one yuan after returning to the north bank of the Suzhou River. Yesterday, after these people participated in the Jiangwan celebration, they took trucks to leave, but many were blocked by the police station at

Sichuan Road Bridge.

Only six trucks crossed the bridge and drove through the Public Concession to Zhaofeng Park, and a large number of tickets had already been purchased, obviously well-planned, intending to have the workers march in Zhaofeng Park, and a large number of Dadao police had also

Stationed outside the park.

However, the Public Works Department's police department had sent plainclothes personnel to guard in front of the park, so the march could not take place. However, the workers and Dadao police had no raincoats and stood in the rain, their clothes all wet.

### Muslims Begin Fasting Yesterday

No eating or drinking during the day

Reflect on oneself and consider one's faults in free time

There are more than 70,000 Muslims in this city. Every year in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, they must fast (commonly known as keeping Zhai) for a month. Yesterday was the second day of the ninth month of the Islamic year 1358, which is the day when Muslims all over the world began fasting. Muslims in this city all began fasting from yesterday. The teachings stipulate that during the fasting period, eating and drinking are prohibited every day from the time the eastern horizon brightens to the time the sun sets. One should only eat and drink after sunset. In addition to managing one's life, one should pray in the church and reflect on oneself and consider one's faults. Every night at seven o'clock, Muslims gather in nearby churches to pray, and the church leaders preach Islamic doctrines. Last night, a "Green Flag" monthly magazine, issued by Muslims, was distributed to Muslims in various churches, and the situation was quite enthusiastic.

### Women's Clothing Industry Strike Deadlocked After Mediation Fails; Labor Demands 100% Wage Increase, Employers Plan to Hire New Workers by Publishing an Advertisement

More than 300 women's clothing workers in the Western-style clothing industry began a strike on the afternoon of the 11th because their demand for a 100% wage increase was not met. Although both sides sent representatives to mediate, the conditions were too far apart, resulting in a stalemate. The details are recorded below.

Strike in effect

More than 300 women's clothing workers in the Western-style clothing industry, citing the increase in the cost of living in Shanghai, submitted a demand to the employers on the 11th of this month for a 100% wage increase. The employers believed that although there have been wage increases in various industries in Shanghai, there has been no precedent for a 100% increase, so they only agreed to a 20% increase (i.e., an increase of five corners for each piece under two yuan). The labor side replied that this was too far from the conditions they had proposed, so they went on strike.

Stalemate

Since the strike, the labor side has appointed Yang Baoshan, Weng Liangsheng, and Chen Xiaodao as representatives. After being recognized by the employers, they held a mediation meeting at the Pengjili Guild Hall at 1 pm on the 15th. Qi Fang sent Lin Zhengren and others to attend. The labor side still insisted on the condition of a 100% wage increase. The reason they gave was that five Western-style clothing stores had already accepted this condition. However, the employers believed that these five were not legitimate stores and could not be cited as examples. Moreover, there was no precedent for a 100% wage increase in various industries in Shanghai. The current offer of a 20% increase can be considered fair. The two sides remained at a stalemate. Although another mediation meeting was held on the 16th, there were no results.

Employers' measures

After the mediation broke down, the guild immediately sent a letter to the Taxpaying Chinese Association, reporting the course of the strike and future measures. It also published an announcement that all women's clothing Western-style clothing stores had temporarily appointed Chen Qingtang as general affairs, Xu Xiaotang as finance, Zhang Wenxing as secretary, and Du and Dai to be responsible for recruiting new workers. Workers who are willing to comply with the employer's 20% wage increase (i.e., an increase of five corners for each coat under two yuan) can resume work as before. Those who still insist on a 100% wage increase will be dismissed.

Raw materials skyrocket

The industry guild is divided into two parts: men's clothing and women's clothing. There are more than 200 members in the men's clothing industry and 20 in the women's clothing industry. There are more than 3,000 workers in the men's clothing industry and more than 300 in the women's clothing industry. Since the outbreak of the European War, raw materials have soared, and the purchasing power of the Shanghai market has also decreased compared to before, resulting in a sluggish business. The average monthly income of workers in this industry is said to be more than 60 yuan. Last November, there was also a strike, which was settled because the employers agreed to increase wages by 20%. Now, unfortunately, this type of event has occurred again, which is not only detrimental to both labor and management, but also inconvenient for customers who order new clothes because they cannot try on new clothes in time.

### Javanese Cultural Figures Visit Shanghai

Visiting the World Expo in the United States

Passing through this port on the return trip

"The Mainland Daily" reported that a cultural delegation composed of Javanese scholars, musicians, and dancers, led by Professor Rettif of English in Batavia, went to the United States to participate in the World Expo. After five months, they recently departed from the west coast of the United States by wheel and passed through Shanghai on Sunday for a short stay. They are scheduled to buy a boat back to Java on Thursday.

### The customs detains German goods stored by Chinese merchants in Haiphong; after negotiations, they have been approved for release; the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requests an extension of the registration deadline, which cannot be completed before the 25th of this month

Regarding the matter of German goods stored by Chinese merchants in Haiphong, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Consulate in Haiphong at the request of the Chinese merchants. The telegram stated, (1) To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing, according to the Xiyanliao Industry Association, the Yanliao products produced by the German Defu Foreign Firm, which was handled by the Sichuan Gang, were transported through Haiphong. Because there were no vehicles to transport them, they were stored in warehouses. Now the Haiphong authorities regard them as enemy goods and detain them, damaging the capital of Chinese merchants. Please rescue them and urge the Ministry to investigate and quickly telegraph the Haiphong authorities to negotiate the release of the merchant goods owned by neutral third countries. Nothing is more important. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Xi. (2) To Consul Liu of the Chinese Consulate in Haiphong, we are grateful for your efforts to negotiate the release of German goods stored by Chinese merchants in Haiphong. According to a letter from merchants here, the Haiphong government has set a deadline of October 25th. The deadline is too tight. There are many procedures for handling certificates in Shanghai, and it is difficult to complete them in time. We urge you to negotiate with the Haiphong authorities to extend the deadline to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. We look forward to your reply. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Xi. It is heard that in addition to sending a telegram, the Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter to the Shanghai French Consulate General to facilitate the issuance of certificates.

### In the Pingwang Lane Shooting Case, a Prostitute Died Tragically; Bodyguards Should Be Held Responsible; The Murderer Escaped, and the Two Bodyguards Were Detained for Recklessly Shooting and Manslaughter and Sent to the Court for Investigation Yesterday

Li Dingshi from Wuxing, Zhejiang, resides at 86 Shigaota Road, Hongkou. He is currently the director and general manager of the Huimin Milk Powder Company. Recently, he has been favored by the Japanese and appointed as the director of the Public Works Bureau of the "Shanghai Municipal Government." Therefore, Li immediately resigned from all positions in Huimin Company in the newspaper to

Take office.

In order to prevent accidents, he hired Hu Changhai (45 years old) and Zhang Lianzhong (24 years old) from Hubei as bodyguards. At 9 pm on the 14th of this month, Li set up a feast at the Meijuan brothel in Pingwang Lane 26, Pingwang Street, inviting guests including Ikeda Seiichi, a consultant of the fake "Municipal Government," Kita Shoichi, a consultant of the fake "Finance Bureau," Sasaki, the head of the special affairs agency, Wang Changchun, a fake "Municipal Government Councilor," and Dong Ming, a director of the fake "China Automobile Company." At the time, it was

A joyous banquet

When suddenly three strong men went upstairs and went straight into Li's room. Each took out a pistol and fired more than a dozen shots in succession. At that time, Ikeda was shot in the face and Kita in the waist. Dong Ming jumped out of the building in a hurry and was also injured. Li, Wang Changchun, and Sasaki avoided the disaster by lying on the ground. At that time, Li's bodyguards Hu Changhai and Zhang Lianzhong were both in the hall downstairs. Suddenly hearing frequent gunshots upstairs, they knew something was wrong. Instead of

Guarding the stairs,

they hid in the downstairs wing room. When they saw the assassins go downstairs and escape through the back door, they each took out a gun and fired from the window. As a result, the assassins all escaped safely, but they shot and killed a prostitute, Xiao Qiaohong (aka Shen Sanbao), in the throat. At the same time, Sun Changyu, the chauffeur of Huang Ruisong, the manager of the Tonghai Trust Company, who was parked in Pingwang Lane, was also injured by stray bullets. After the old patrol room was notified, he immediately ordered Chinese detective Wang Shusen and detective Zhang Bingchun to

Investigate.

The assassins had all escaped without a trace. It was determined that Li's bodyguards Hu and Zhang should have been guarding the entrance of the staircase, in which case the assassins would not have been able to escape. However, they hid in the wing room and fired recklessly, causing the prostitute Xiao Qiaohong to die tragically. They should be held responsible for the negligence. Therefore, Hu and Zhang

Were detained

and sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The patrol room lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the process, saying that the case still needs to be investigated, so he requested a change of date for review. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xieffen, the two defendants were ordered to be remanded in custody and the trial was rescheduled. After Xiao Qiaohong Sanbao was shot and killed, Sanbao's mother learned of the situation and negotiated with the fake "officials." As a result, Li Dingshi was responsible for all the funeral arrangements for the prostitute, and also paid a loss fee of one thousand yuan.

### Smuggling of Waste Copper and Iron: The Ringleader Arrested

Repeated offenses, trial adjourned

At around 5 am on the 16th (the day before yesterday), Patrolman No. 446 dispatched by the French Patrol Department was patrolling near the wire fence at the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Caishi Road. He caught a glimpse of a man moving old copper and scrap iron from the Chinese Concession to the French Concession, so he stepped forward to arrest him. The man immediately took out five yuan in banknotes, intending to bribe him, but was rejected by the patrolman. He was taken to the patrol room and identified as Gao Guisheng (37 years old, from Qingjiang). After investigation, it was found that Gao was a well-known leader of a thief gang who had repeatedly committed crimes such as robbery and murder in the French Concession and had been wanted. He was transferred to the Second Criminal Court yesterday, where Judge Miao presided over the hearing in the First Criminal Court. The patrol room said that the defendant had committed repeated offenses and still needed to be investigated, so it requested an extension. The court, after reviewing the case, ordered the trial to be rescheduled for the 26th of this month, and the defendant was remanded in custody.

### On the Anhui Ship, Male and Female Abductors Were Arrested and Three Children Were Found

On the morning of the 14th of this month, the French Patrol Department, based on informant reports, said that the Anhui ship was moored at Pier 2 of the Bund Taikoo and was about to sail to Macau. There were male and female abductors in the steerage of the ship. Detective Shen Jinshu, Yao Zhupo, detective Zhong Benchang, Jiang Yiyong, Xu Fuming, etc. were dispatched to

Board the ship to arrest them.

As expected, the ringleader Zhang Qingxiang (also known as Zhang Xianglang, 33 years old, from Chongming, residing at 248 Xinxin Lane, Jin Shenfu Road) and Zhang's mistress Zhang Xiuzhen, also known as Lu Sunshi (36 years old, from Haining), and Xue Wangshi (also known as Wang Guiying, 26 years old, from Chongming, residing at 530 Kangti Road) were arrested on the ship, and three boys were found, one named Shunfa, 11 years old, one named A Jin, 7 years old, and one named A Da, 5 years old. They were all

Taken to the patrol room.

According to Zhang Qingxiang, after abducting the children, he hid them in a bungalow at Xiaohua Bridge at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Columbia Road. Zhang Xiuzhen hired Xue Wangshi to accompany the children to Macau. When they were arrested, Xue Wangshi was sleeping in the quilt with the children. According to Xue Wangshi, she was introduced to Zhang by her maternal aunt Jin to accompany the children, receiving

A reward of 30 yuan

each time. Subsequently, the patrol room sent detectives to 530 Kangti Road to arrest Jin, but she had already fled after hearing the news. Only passports and children's clothes were found. The detectives waited at Jin's house and arrested Wang Ruiqi (41 years old, from Chongming). They were all sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday, where the handling detective Zhong Benchang reported on the

Course of the case.

Afterwards, the patrol room requested an extension of the investigation. Judge Miao Qingbang briefly questioned them and ordered the trial to be rescheduled for the 26th. The children were temporarily sent to Guangci Hospital for foster care, pending family members to claim them.

### Unchaste, Accuses Husband of Assault, Sentenced to 40 Days of Detention

Kuang Baolian (27 years old this year), the wife of Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of the Penglai City Market in Nanshi, was recently sued for assault by his mistress Cheng Meifang (20 years old this year, from Hankou, the daughter of Cheng Chen, a woman who had been sentenced by the Second Special Court for fraud involving jewelry, etc.) to the French Concession Patrol Room, and was prosecuted by the Patrol Room to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for the crime of assault. The case was tried in the Criminal

Eighth Court yesterday by Judge Zhu Chuzhe.

The defendant Kuang Baolian hired lawyer Jiang Pingfan to appear in court to defend him. First, lawyer Yao Zhaodi, representing the administrative authorities of the French Concession, stated the case based on the accusation of the accuser Cheng Meifang. Judge Zhu then questioned the defendant Kuang Baolian based on this. According to Kuang, "I have been living with Cheng Meifang for six years. At first, we were introduced by a friend and were initially at peace. She (referring to Cheng Meifang) has given me two children, one of whom died prematurely, and the other is four years old this year. After the war, I

Was once unemployed.

Although I have recently been working at the Jiangxi Road American Wireless Company, my monthly salary is only 40 yuan. I give her all my monthly salary, but I still can't satisfy her. Her mother and brothers live in the Meiren Lane on Hankou Road. The house there is my father's property and doesn't require rent. It is possible to maintain life with my monthly income without freezing or starving. Unexpectedly, she has other plans and often quarrels, and she often comes back at twelve o'clock at night, or even

Doesn't return all night.

About three months ago, I took my four-year-old child to my parents' residence at 698 Lane 9, Pushi Road, for temporary residence, hoping she would repent. Later, she asked lawyer Fan Gang to write a letter, saying that I had abandoned her. On the first of this month, I met her on Aiduya Road and took her to Pushi Road, hoping to live together. Unexpectedly, she still quarreled willfully. No one beat her. She went out again by herself. The next day, she called to threaten me and then led the patrol room to call me

To the patrol room. She said that I beat her, which is really clear. The court also questioned the accuser Cheng Meifang. According to Cheng, "I have been married to Kuang Baolian for six or seven years. In the beginning, the feelings between the two sexes were very strong, but in recent years I have suffered abuse. This time I was beaten and injured, so I had no choice but to sue." The court asked if they were officially married, and Cheng gave vague answers. Although she said they were married, she could not say the date. The court said to Cheng, "If you sue for abandonment, you are a person with the ability to save yourself. If you want living expenses, you

Cannot prove

that you are officially married. In the opinion of this court, it is better not to litigate and still have hope of living together." Cheng still said that she wanted to sue Kuang Baolian for assault. After the court ordered the debate, it sentenced Kuang Baolian to 40 days of detention for injuring another person's body, which could be commuted to a fine of two yuan per day. After hearing the sentence, Kuang Baolian declared in court that he would not accept it and decided to appeal.

The Hongqiao District in western Shanghai has recently been rife with robbers, and robberies are frequently heard. For example, Gu Youyu and Gu Chen, the victims of burns in Gujiatang, and Li Ada, a woman who was beaten to death, have made villagers turn pale at the mention of it and dare not live in their homes. Last night (15th), in the middle of the night, Sun Genglang of Xunanli in Hongqiao Town, and the home of Sun Liansheng, the former local protector, were also visited by a large number of robbers, more than 20 people.

Spring and Autumn

### A Tense Scene

— One Without

After passing through the defense zone of two foreign gatekeepers, it felt like falling into an area of heat haze and a cacophony of voices. Wiping the water droplets from my hair and face, I began to forget that outside on the road, there was a somber autumn rain and a world of muddy sludge.

Squeezing through the throng of people to the stands, it happened that this round of gambling was about to decide its final fate. Six Russians wearing red jerseys pushed six numbered dogs into iron cages. The starter waved a white flag lightly, and a mechanical rabbit sped from the opposite side of the track. Then, six dogs, like arrows released from a bowstring, chased after the target. Originally, people's attitudes were so relaxed and leisurely: smoking cigarettes, leaning on wicker chairs drinking tea, discussing which dog would run first on which day. But at this moment, it was different. Everyone stood up, stretching their necks, watching the twenty-four scurrying dog legs in the arena, silently reciting the number they had bought, eyes fixed on the position and order of the dog. A bespectacled gentleman near me exclaimed happily: "Ah! Number two!" But number two dog was really disappointing, colliding with number six when turning, smoothly allowing numbers five and one to chase ahead. The gentleman was so angry that, without waiting for the referee's red and green light report, he had already torn the ticket to shreds, throwing it into the air, and the money had already flown into someone else's pocket.

This thirty-second tense situation can cause a person's heart to stop beating and feel the suffocation of depression.

Returning to the gentle ticket-buying room. In the crowd, I felt the embarrassment of insignificance. Many people's eyes were watching me, despising me, as if saying, "Poor kid, what makes you think you deserve to be here? So pathetic!" The police officer gave me a meaningful look, and a poster on the wall read, "Beware of Pickpockets," as if it were meant for me.

Indeed, this is where wealthy Chinese gentlemen come to change their tastes after playing with women and tiring of mahjong; watching dog races is not a method of amusement on a secluded island. But one question arises before me: I find that half of those who gamble are not really rich; they are harboring a psychology of luck and greed.

At this time, I paid attention to everyone's actions:

In a dark corner, there was a very thin man with eyes sunken in deep sockets, looking like he hadn't had enough opium, pulling out a record book of past dog races and comparing it with today's program. He was so focused that he didn't even notice the cigarette butt burning his fingers.

Two people were having a humorous conversation. The first one said, "You didn't listen to me, not buying number five, Yellow Lion Hoof." Another said, "Wasn't number two very good? If it hadn't been for the fight, it would have definitely run first—it's really infuriating, I wish I could run for it!"

In the bar, a very fat man, with a cigar clipped between his fingers, was shaking his head, calling for a boy to collect the winnings. The boy brought a large stack of bills, but a pair of clean white hands gently pressed down on them. She nimbly took a five-yuan bill and gave it to the boy, then familiarly put the rest into her wallet, a foxy smile on her face. The big guy said, "What does this matter!"

"Don't show off, just go back; if you don't have enough capital, you'll definitely lose," such a voice came from behind me. I was too embarrassed to turn around and look at them immediately. Running a little further, it seemed to be employees of a small shop, an older one talking to a younger one.

The time had come. I was mixed in the crowd, my mind gripped by the chaotic and messy black hand. This is a world forgotten by war, without hunger, without suffering, only the laughter of prostitution, people chewing bone marrow triumphantly, and...

### A Sound Physique and a Sound Mind

The neon lights of the Great World's advertising sign shone on the center of the street, causing every passerby to raise their heads in a hurry, casting envious glances. The dancing bee seemed like a silkworm spinning silk, diligently weaving winter clothing for people.

"This year's wool yarn is too expensive to afford!"

In the crowd, who let out such a heavy sigh: "Too expensive to afford" pierced everyone's heart like an arrow—just when they had taken a breath from the heavy burden of rice prices at forty yuan per dan, they had to worry anxiously about winter clothes for the whole family "in the autumn wind."

On the other side illuminated by the neon lights, there was a long row of clean glass windows, inside displaying even more dazzling items: a fawn immersed in medicinal liquid; two beautiful antlers; ginseng branches packed in brocade boxes; and... in short, "tonics."

Yes, while most people were worried about being "unable to fend off the cold," some felt it was time for "timely nourishment."

Those who labor all year round, running around for food and clothing, indeed feel the panic of life when rice rises to forty yuan per dan; they sigh deeply when wool yarn is too expensive to afford. However, their bodies, tempered by wind, frost, rain, and snow, do not need the exquisite tonics displayed in the glass windows. At the same time, it will not arouse that kind of extravagant desire, hoping to taste something different, because they already have a strong physique.

But what about those noble people who are worshiped like fresh flowers in greenhouses? They grow up in unclean air, and their enjoyment is also depriving them of their health. So when they feel physically weak, they want to make up for it with "tonics." But they don't know that "food nourishment is better than medicinal nourishment." Doctors also instruct patients to maintain their health by exercising, breathing fresh air, and eating more nutritious food. So taking tonics is not a kind of "enjoyment," but "curing illness." But who can pay attention to the incubation period of their illness beforehand? On the contrary, they indulge in sensual pleasures and accelerate the decline of their bodies—at this time, "tonics" may have already lost their effectiveness.

Similarly, to cultivate a sound spirit, one must pay attention to the incubation period of the disease beforehand and "cure the disease" afterward, just like tempering a sound physique. Various industrial, commercial, educational, and charitable organizations in this city, "seeing that the morals of the world are declining day by day, and that a sense of integrity and shame is being lost, so much so that even people with status and reputation in society are disregarding integrity and shame, and are obsessed with power and benefits, shamelessly serving their enemies," have initiated a movement to promote integrity and shame. Being "obsessed with power and benefits" is like people worshiped in greenhouses being deceived by "enjoyment," resulting in physical weakness and the need for timely nourishment. The measures set by the movement to promote integrity and shame: (1) Vowing not to participate in shameless undertakings and not to accept shameless money; (2) Jointly condemning shameless people with words and writings, without any favoritism, are precisely the right medicine for the incubation period of the disease. (Huang Ziqiang)

To the Editor: I have just read the account of the examination for radio operators in your column on October 6th, which exposed the fact that "XX Wireless Electric Specialty School" is falsely recruiting people and making fun of young people. I am very impressed with the righteous call! However, there is more than one wireless electric school in Shanghai that specializes in fighting for fame. Your newspaper is kind and benevolent, and hides its name; but because Zeng Shen killed someone, the innocent are suffering. I am writing to you to request that you publish the real name of the school in order to set things straight!

Sanji Wireless Electric Specialty School

Your school's request to publish the real name of the school to set things straight is certainly appropriate. However, since our newspaper was kind and benevolent before, why should we expose the school afterward? However, what you call XX refers to another school, and it is definitely not referring to your school. I am writing a few words to relieve your concerns. Spring and Autumn Editorial Office Attached

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Sixteen: Planning to Establish a Medical School to Train Scholars, Thinking About Expanding the Village Governance and Entrusting Children to Care For

This is because he started early, knowing that there would be a need for this kind of thing everywhere in the future, and he had already prepared for it. This is what Village Chief Zhu called a speculative enterprise. Even so, relying solely on speculation is useless, and the spleen is also very important. Because the seedlings supplied by Freedom Village are carefully selected, he has invited specialists to study and investigate them, and has also written many detailed explanations, which are indeed different from others. Later, the number of people coming to ask for them increased day by day, and the nursery they ran also became wider and wider. Fortunately, this nursery is constantly innovating, sending out a large number of well-planted seedlings and adding a large number of new ones, turning all the mountain land into nurseries. Once this trend started, the villagers of Zhongcun did not allow even an inch of space under the shade of the walls or three bows of land by the fence to be empty, and they would definitely find a way to plant a few saplings. A young student, under the shade of the willow behind his house, surrounded by a small bamboo fence, would pull his little classmates after school to see the trees he had planted. These nurseries are a relatively large source of income for Freedom Village, and Village Chief Zhu is very interested in them. Now, they are also trying to plant many precious seedlings collected from abroad. In addition to the nurseries, the output of several collectively-run village farms is also not small. They also have collectively-run village livestock farms, village transport companies, and village buses. In short, the annual income is also very generous. If there are any special expenses, they can also borrow village bonds, and some people also donate to the village. However, Village Chief Zhu and the people in charge of the village all live within their means. They would rather postpone things that can be postponed, believing in the method of gradual progress. As long as the foundation is established, they are not afraid that Freedom Village will not prosper in the future. However, Village Chief Zhu and the others always keep a close eye on education and health, and cannot ignore them. So today, he discussed the matter of the nursery with his lover. Several townships in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have already established nurseries, and Freedom Village has also proposed it before. Although Freedom Village cannot have a well-organized infant care home like Anle Town, a nursery seems to be essential. Having one can be extended to having several, which is our next generation's business, what is called the masters of the future. What will the next generation do? How much will they progress? We don't know at all at the moment, but we must prepare everything for them. This is the duty of our previous generation. We have also received the kindness of the previous generation, and we will repay our next generation in return. The world continues to be inherited in this way. It is true:

Do not say that the new and old have metabolism.
You must know that cultures promote each other. (192) He Nake made

### Kun Opera Will Not Decline

— Oddball

Success depends on human effort; may enthusiasts rise up together!

Kun Opera is the ancestor of Chinese opera and the earliest developed form of drama. It has excellent scripts, excellent music, and extremely delicate expressions. After thinking about it, it should not decline no matter what! Just like the sun will never come out from the west!

But why is it so depressed now? The reason is very simple, it is the four words "human effort not exhausted." I have already explained this very thoroughly in my White and Red Studio Drama Talk in this publication last year. Not striving will lead to decline, is the universal truth of natural selection. Have you ever seen anyone in the world succeed without struggling? Whether it is Hitler, Shaw, or even Chaplin, Mei Lanfang, none of them have not put in a lot of hard work.

Kun Opera first appeared as a hall theater, and its history is at least two hundred years old. However, in the meantime, I can frankly say that it has simply never been improved. It is truly a matter of closing the door and guarding itself. It is a great fluke to be able to barely survive to this day!

"Reviving Kun Opera," this question has been circling in my mind for a full five years. Whenever I have time, I bury my head in writing plans and constantly research and consult with people related to all parties. Now I can boldly say that if my plan can be implemented, it will be of great help to the revival of Kun Opera.

Because I have always been against "talking on paper" and hate "scholars rebelling, failing in three years," I don't want to say more here (so as not to cause many unnecessary debates). As for the motivation for writing this article, it is sincerely to find a few people who are willing to cooperate (note that the scope of cooperation is to do real work, not to hold symposiums or debates). If there are comrades who love Kun Opera and have considerable financial resources, just write a letter to me (send it to the editorial department of this publication), and I will definitely visit you immediately.

Random Notes of an Artist

### The Early Chinese Martial Arts Star, Fan Xuepeng, Who Improved Civilized Drama

— Yunmen

Fan Xuepeng, who abandoned the life of silver screen glamour, is now a popular figure at the "Green Treasure Theater."

Thirteen years ago, during the "golden age" of martial arts films, Miss Fan completed her debut in "Thirteen Sisters" at "Youlian," and since then, Fan Xuepeng's name has become familiar to everyone on the early Chinese silver screen.

However, gradually, from "Youlian" to "Tianyi," this "martial arts star" changed her style after all. That is to say, she was discovered by the directors to have a natural talent for acting in tragedies, so "Ren Zhu" made her once again attract the attention of the silver screen.

Before August 13th, she was a basic actor of Yihua Film Company. "A Pearl in the Palm" was a famous ethical film, and Fan Xuepeng was the most successful in grasping the character's personality in the play. However, from that time on, the war made her jump out of the film circle, and "A Pearl in the Palm" was her last work. Her occasional theatrical career actually began at the "Dahua Theater." Under the direction of Wu Wei, she played the role of Guan Xiugu in "A Marriage to Laugh and Cry," which swept millions of audiences in Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Changsha, and Shanghai, and lasted for a full year.

She received a lot of help from her husband, Wen Yimin, at "Youlian." After the war, she once performed at the Great China Drama Theater, and was hired by "Green Treasure" three months later. She has been there for more than a year now.

Now, she has partners with the same "improved civilized drama" interests as Gu Menghu, Chen Qiufeng, and Tian Xin, etc., she said heavily.

"I have traveled half of China. I understand that drama is only a link in education. Seeing the level of audiences in various counties and cities in the mainland, I really have to sigh at those drama workers who specialize in touting "slogans," only going their own way to win over the very few "masses" who have "already received education." Therefore, I resolutely jumped onto the stage."

Her original name is Yao Xiongfei, she is thirty years old this year, and she is from Yixing, Jiangsu.

### Mei Lanfang's Private Life (Four)

— Li Feishu

—Random Memories of Mei, Six—

Family Situation

His family is very simple. Besides his wife, Madam Fu Zhifang, there are three sons and one daughter. The eldest son is named Bao Chen, fifteen years old. The second is Bao Zhen, thirteen. The third daughter is Bao Yue, ten years old. The youngest is named Bao Jiu, six years old. All four are in school. In their spare time at home, they also hire Chinese and English teachers for tutoring. Mr. Mei urges them to study very strictly! All four have good natural endowments. Judging from their temperament and ambition, the eldest son wants to be a pilot or study mechanical engineering. The second son understands things and has a clear plan in mind, if he doesn't study law, he will study medicine. The third daughter is gentle and inclined to literature. The youngest son is more intelligent than ordinary children, and his appearance is very much like his father. The one who will be able to continue Mr. Mei's mantle in the future must be this son. Although he is young, he likes music the most. When he was four or five years old, he could distinguish several dozen records placed together, whose record it was and what play was being sung. As soon as the phonograph played, he would know what play it was and who was singing it. Even if it was the same "Escorting the Prisoner" record, he could distinguish the difference in the music. It is truly amazing! With such a rich talent, if he can be trained early, in less than ten years, there will surely be a day when "the whole city will be talking about Little Lanfang."

Madam Fu, Mr. Mei's wife, is very warm, generous, and dignified. After marrying my teacher, she hired a teacher to study, and she can complete the books on Mencius and classical Chinese. The other day, we talked about Zhang Jian of Nantong refusing to open the Zhaoguan Dam (later, the downstream had a good harvest, and Zhang Jian donated rice from the downstream to help the upstream). Madam said: This is what is meant by "If there is famine in Henan, then move its people to Hedong, and move its grain to Henan; if there is famine in Hedong, do the same." The use of allusions is very appropriate. Her speech and manner are indicative. Recently, she has become even better at managing the household. If she can use her spare time to pursue the pleasures of classical books again, it is indeed a way to pass the time. Mr. Mei's mother-in-law also lives in Mr. Mei's house. Besides, there are only two or three maids and four or five male servants! It is not like what outsiders say, that he keeps many bodyguards. Mr. Mei has no conflicts with anyone, and his assets are not even up to par with the average person. Outwardly, it is like a bucket of Gallic cigarettes, but inside it contains Front Gate brand cigarettes, which can be described as "sheep in tiger's skin." Among the wealthy in Shanghai, he is really not even a grain of rice in Taicang. So, in fact, there is no need to take precautions. However, because he often travels for performances, he needs someone to take care of him on the way, so the few people used in the house are mostly heroes from Yan and Zhao. Each one is strong and powerful, and good at shooting. However, after entering the Mei family, they are heroes with no place to use their talents.

Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

### Yuanwai, Beile, Candidate Official

In the old days, people who often traveled around were even more attentive to their nicknames. For example, when the old hero Chu Biao of the "Wax Temple" registered after disguising himself, he deliberately raised his voice to emphasize the seven words "Known in the Jianghu as Iron-Armed Biao," forcefully reading them out. It can be seen that the old hero Chu was very proud of receiving the nicknames "Iron-Armed Biao" and "Iron-Headed Tai Sui." At the same time, any young hero who had not earned a nickname always felt that his qualifications were shallow and his reputation was small.

The nicknames given to people in the pear garden are based on their personality, appearance, etc., such as Yu Mao Bao and Wang Datou. Some are named after people's attire, dress, actions, style, etc. There are three people who belong to the latter category, namely Li Yuanwai Lianzhong, Tan Beile Xinpei, and Sun Candidate Official Juxian.

Li Lianzhong is the teacher of the current internal court senior retainer Rui Debao, and was one of the best martial arts performers in the old days. His movements were skilled and his dialogue was crisp. Whenever Tan performed "Battle of Changsha," he would always have Li play the role of Wei Yan, which was known as the three perfects at the time. Even Xiaolou's complete "Stealing the Imperial Horse" could not achieve the effect of complementing each other without Li playing Dou Erdun. However, the old gentleman originally came from a Bangzi troupe and was used to being frugal, so he never wore silk in his life. In winter, he would wear a blue cloth robe over a cloth belt, with blue cloth shoes, a felt hat, and a long-stemmed early smoking pipe in his hand; his tobacco pouch was filled with old Guandong (tobacco leaves. Extremely pungent). People would suspect that he was a country bumpkin when they saw his attire. (121)
