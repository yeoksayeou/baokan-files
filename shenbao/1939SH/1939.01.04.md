### Universally Denouncing Wang Jingwei and Supporting the Government's Determination to Fight to the End; Guangdong Military and Political Leaders Li Han-hun and Others Will Issue a Circular Telegram Condemning Wang; Some Central Committee Members and Military Figures Advocate for a Public Order for His Arrest; It is Reported That There Will Be a Reshuffle of Political Institutions Soon

(Hong Kong) The elements of the puppet organization in Guangzhou are greatly demoralized due to the failure of their pro-peace efforts. Guangdong military and political leaders, starting with Li Han-hun, will issue a circular telegram in the coming days to denounce [Wang Jingwei] and will declare in the telegram their determination to counterattack Guangzhou and eliminate the traitors and rebels in South China. Guangdong military leaders are optimistic about the prospects of the war, and morale is greatly boosted. Fifty-four organizations in Hong Kong issued a joint telegram today to condemn [Wang Jingwei]. (Special dispatch at 12:00 PM on the 3rd)

(Hong Kong) The Central Government does not intend to make any further statements regarding [Wang] Jingwei, taking pity on his temporary delusion and hoping he will repent and return to the country. Some young Central Committee members and military figures advocate for a public order for his arrest, which is under consideration by the Central Government. Feng Yuxiang said that [Wang] Jingwei has gone mad. He knew this long ago and regrets that Sun Fengming's assassination attempt in the past failed. A bronze statue should now be cast for Sun. (Special dispatch at 7:00 PM on the 3rd)

(Chongqing) As a result of the dismissal and expulsion of [Wang] Jingwei from the party, there may be a major political reshuffle next week. It is rumored that the position of Deputy Director-General of the Kuomintang will be given to a well-known leftist leader or a non-communist leader of the Communist Party, which may bring the Communist Party closer to the Kuomintang. According to political circles here, this would further demonstrate the unity of the Chinese people. The defection of Wang [Jingwei] caused temporary panic among political circles here, but they quickly calmed down, and the political institutions showed no signs of weakness. The diplomatic community in Chongqing has been closely monitoring the overall situation. It is now claimed that Wang's escape has actually strengthened the authority of the National Government. Although Wang has the support of some people, they are greatly disturbed by the bizarre policies now being pursued. Many have recently left him. An observer told a Reuters reporter that the government is better off without Wang than with him, as Wang is weak, incompetent, and indecisive. The government's swift announcement of Wang's crimes will greatly stabilize public sentiment. Most Chinese and foreign observers studying the current political situation do not believe that Wang will join the new regime in Nanjing or Beiping and rashly combine with a dangerous speculative attempt. The Chinese here believe that if Wang does this, he will have no basis for success. They believe that Wang may now be hiding in a convenient location to observe changes in the overall situation. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)

(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong Journalists Association held a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees and resolved to support the Central Government's determination to fight to the end and oppose Wang's proposal for peace talks. A declaration will be issued in the coming days. (Dispatch on the 3rd)

Manila The overseas Chinese communities in the Philippines jointly telegraphed Chairman Lin [Sen] and Chairman Chiang [Kai-shek] on the 3rd, supporting the expulsion of Wang Zhaoming from the party and the continuation of the war of resistance, and opposing compromise midway. (Dispatch on the 3rd)

(Hong Kong) Various organizations in Hong Kong telegraphed Chairman Lin [Sen] and President Chiang [Kai-shek] on the 2nd, saying, "To Chairman Lin and President Chiang: As the situation in the war of resistance is improving, Wang Zhaoming suddenly issued the fallacious argument of seeking peace, the content of which is directly echoing [Japanese Prime Minister] Konoe's words, shaking people's hearts and confusing the public. This will lead our divine descendants into an irrecoverable abyss. Upon hearing the news, we are extremely indignant. Even after the withdrawal from Wuhan, the enemy has not been able to defeat our main forces. Britain and the United States have lent us huge sums of money. The international situation is clearly unfavorable to the enemy. The enemy knows that military force is not enough to conquer China, so they want to destroy us politically by colluding with shameless and unprincipled people in our country to achieve their divisive goals. Now, the Central Government has clearly ordered the expulsion of Wang Zhaoming from the party and relieved him of his duties. The government's determination to resist the war has become even stronger, and the people's faith in the government has become even more solid. Our association, etc., sincerely supports the government's proposal to eliminate domestic reactionaries and carry out the war of resistance to the end, in order to achieve the final victory. We respectfully report this by telegram, hoping for your careful consideration." The Hong Kong Women's Comfort Association, Hong Kong Chinese Women's Association, Hong Kong Women's New Movement Association, China Youth Ambulance Corps, Motorcycle Research General Union, etc., kowtow. (Dispatch on the 3rd)

(Chongqing) According to official sources, telegrams are now pouring in from all parts of China and overseas, supporting the government's decision to expel Wang Jingwei from the party. The public believes that the government's swift and severe handling of Wang's defection has eliminated all kinds of rumors caused by Wang's departure from Chongqing. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)

The Central Propaganda Department Urges the People Not to Be Lenient

(Chongqing) The Central Propaganda Department issued a public statement on the 1st regarding Wang Zhaoming's absurd remarks, adding corrections. On that day, because the Central Executive Committee had not yet made a decision to expel him from the party, the statement only expressed regret in addition to refuting Wang Zhaoming's absurd remarks. This statement could not be sent to the newspapers for publication on the evening of the 1st, so it was published in the newspapers on the 2nd together with the resolution of the Central Executive Committee on the 2nd. However, this statement slightly contradicted the resolution of the Central Executive Committee. Now, it is reiterated that since the Central Executive Committee has resolved that Wang Zhaoming's actions are a violation of party discipline and endanger the party and the country, and has decided to expel him from the party forever and remove him from all positions, all comrades of the party and all compatriots across the country should abide by this resolution, rectify discipline, and not be lenient in the slightest. It must be known that abiding by national laws and adhering to party discipline is the foundation of our party's revolutionary spirit and the primary condition for winning the war of resistance and building the country. All comrades of the party and all compatriots across the country must deeply understand this. The above document was issued later, so it is necessary to provide a solemn explanation regarding the timing. This is a special statement. (Dispatch on the 3rd)

(Chongqing) The Central News Agency, the official Chinese news agency here, published yesterday Wang Jingwei's declaration issued from Hong Kong, which called on the Chinese government to accept the peace proposal of Japanese Prime Minister Konoe. Government officials can see the attitude toward this declaration in the decision to expel [Wang Jingwei] from the party and remove him from various positions. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)

Ye Chucang Appointed Minister of Propaganda

(Chongqing) The Central Government has appointed Ye Chucang as Minister of Propaganda to succeed Zhou Fohai, who has been vacated. According to recent news, Zhou has followed Wang Jingwei from Kunming to Hanoi. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)

(Chongqing) A certain important figure in the Kuomintang told an Associated Press reporter that Wang Jingwei was the leader of the Reorganization Clique seven or eight years ago and has always opposed the policies of the central government. Later, Wang served in important central positions, and the Reorganization Clique dissolved imperceptibly. Young people who supported the Reorganization Clique joined other political groups, so the Reorganization Clique has disappeared from the Chinese political stage. In recent years, Wang has had no supporters, only a few private followers, such as Chen Gongbo, Zeng Zhongming, and Chu Minyi. When Wang served as President of the Executive Yuan three years ago, they all held important positions. Now, all three are in Hong Kong, assisting Wang in his work. In addition to these three, there are more than a dozen other followers. It is decided that part of the reason Wang escaped from Chongqing was that he had lost power and had no supporters. At the same time, Wang himself has many shortcomings, as do his followers. Today, official circles formally acknowledged the news of the arrest of Wang's party members. According to Kuomintang personnel, Wang Jingwei has no party members at all, only a few followers. (Associated Press dispatch on the 3rd)

Newspapers in Chongqing Unanimously Condemn Wang Jingwei

(Chongqing) After Wang Jingwei appealed to the Chinese government to accept Japan's peace terms, the newspapers here unanimously condemned him, calling him a "traitor." The Communist Party's organ, "Xinhua Daily," declared that Wang Zhaoming, the former Chairman of the Central Political Council, has now betrayed the people. His departure will only strengthen the forces of resistance. "Xinshu Daily" said that Wang is a "lowly person." The military organ, "Saodang Daily," said that Wang's "actions are shameless and his crimes are unforgivable." (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)

(Chongqing) This morning, all Chinese newspapers unanimously supported the Central Government's measures to expel Wang Jingwei from the party and remove him from various positions. The military organ, "Saodang Daily," stated that Wang's treasonous actions are unforgivable. "Xinshu Daily" stated that Wang's behavior is despised by the Chinese people. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)

Chongqing's Central Daily News today called in an editorial for the death penalty for traitors and those who betray the country, while advocating for honoring heroes who defend the country. The newspaper said that the government's decision to expel Wang Jingwei from the party and dismiss him from his post is the most important thing in the New Year because such measures can strengthen China's determination to resist the war. (Associated Press dispatch on the 3rd)

Wang Made Meticulous Plans Before Leaving Chongqing

(Chongqing) According to government officials here, Wang Jingwei meticulously planned his departure from Chongqing more than a month ago. At that time, Wang's son, who was studying at Nankai University in Kunming, suddenly left school. Before Wang himself left Chongqing, his family and secretaries had already taken their luggage and books to Hanoi, leaving only one servant at the Chongqing residence. This shows his determination not to return here. Yesterday, it was formally announced that Wang had been expelled from the party and removed from all his positions. Chinese newspapers unanimously expressed their enthusiastic support. Although the newspapers expressed regret for Wang, they said that neither the government nor the country had suffered any damage. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)

(Hong Kong) Newspapers here reported today that Wang Jingwei boarded the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso to Shanghai and then Nanjing before issuing his declaration on December 30, but this news could not be confirmed by responsible parties. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)

(London) The stock exchange here was closed yesterday, so there is no sign of the impact of Wang Jingwei's declaration on Far Eastern public bonds. The newspapers did not pay special attention to the declaration. Some newspapers did not even publish a single word, and the general opinion is that Wang's declaration will prove to be a "damp squib." The Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, told a Reuters reporter yesterday that this matter is regrettable, but it has no effect on China's solemnly announced policy. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)

(Hong Kong) The Chinese newspapers here this morning all claimed that Wang Jingwei had taken the Italian liner Conte Rosso to Shanghai on December 29. However, the reporter recently learned from well-informed sources that Wang did not go to Shanghai and is still in a certain area of Guangdong Province, colluding with a group of frustrated Chinese military officers, planning to first establish a pro-Japanese puppet regime in Guangdong. It is also rumored that Wang is currently lobbying the Japanese to withdraw Japanese troops from Guangzhou. It is said that the Japanese may accept Wang's request, but the Japanese will still leave a small number of troops to defend the military strongholds outside Guangzhou. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)

Overseas Chinese Support the Central Government's Policy

After Wang Zhaoming's telegram was published in Hong Kong, telegrams denouncing Wang have been received from overseas. In Singapore, after the news of Wang's advocacy of peace talks spread, overseas Chinese were extremely indignant. The press openly attacked Wang, and anti-Wang slogans were found on the streets. The attitude of overseas Chinese in Manila is also the same, unanimously supporting the Central Government's policy. Foreigners here have shown no expression toward Wang's advocacy of peace talks. The anti-Wang attitude of overseas Chinese in Batavia is very active. (Dispatch on the 3rd)

The Chongqing Branch of the Kuomintang in Siam and the General Branch in the Philippines telegraphed the Director-General, supporting the war of resistance to the end. The two telegrams are recorded as follows: (1) The Overseas Department of the Chongqing Central Party Headquarters relayed to Director-General Chiang: The enemy's dream of a quick victory has been shattered by our loyal and brave soldiers at the front. These despicable creatures, without remorse, are making a desperate gamble to indulge their ferocity by invading Guangzhou. The news has stirred up extreme indignation among overseas Chinese. According to resolutions of the affiliated organizations, we all support our wise leader in long-term resistance to recover the lost territories and protect the survival of our Republic of China to comfort the millions of overseas Chinese in Siam. We respectfully pray for victory and wish you peace. The Chongqing Branch of the Kuomintang in Siam, the General Association of Overseas Chinese Supporting National Salvation in Siam. (2) To Director-General Chiang: The East Celebrates the Founding Anniversary of the Republic of China Grand Assembly unanimously resolved to support your declaration of fighting to the end. We respectfully send this telegram in salute. The General Branch and affiliated organizations in the Philippines kowtow together. (Dispatch on the 3rd)

Editorial

### Answering Readers' Questions—The Wang Jingwei Affair—

Regarding the Wang Jingwei affair, this newspaper has repeatedly condemned his arrogance and absurdity, and all parties agree and deeply resent his perversity. Occasionally, some pity his life experience, but none show him any sympathy. Modern philosophical theories have flourished, and people often lament the lack of moral standards and the absence of theoretical laws when discussing people and events. In fact, the distinction between right and wrong, and the division between extreme good and evil, must be based on the common understanding of all people, becoming an indelible principle. The speed and strictness of public opinion's response leave no room for compromise, just as black and white are known at a glance without thinking, and as fragrant and foul odors are distinguished at a touch without examination. Therefore, Wang Jingwei's words and actions are despised by the world, and his self-destruction can almost be regarded as a settled conclusion, which does not need to be discussed further. However, a reader questioned the reporter with several questions, which were quite meaningful. I will recount them as follows.

The reader asked: "Everyone unanimously condemns Wang Jingwei's perversity and absurdity. In the midst of passionate resistance, such a reaction is natural. However, the matter is something that common sense would not allow. Could it be that he is not as good as ordinary people? Perhaps he has some profound reasons worthy of our humble study? He is in the central government and has more immediate knowledge than the common people. Could it be that he has seen through some weaknesses in the military resistance that led him to surrender first in order to save himself? He has long been known as a veteran of the party and the country, and his faction has long been established. Could it be that his wings have grown strong enough that he has gained enough influence to hold the country hostage or to offer something to the enemy? Now that the spirit of solidarity has been split in this way, will the forces of resistance be weakened somewhat? Wang Jingwei is not completely foolish. If he did not have some confidence, how could he rashly commit such a great injustice to the world? All these questions have not been addressed in this newspaper's previous discussions. Please enlighten me."

Wang Jingwei's recent words and actions are comparable to the Xi'an Incident in December 1936. Both violated public opinion, went against the tide of events, and were extremely strange on the surface, outside of normal emotions and reason. Both failed to measure their virtue and abilities and were driven by their desire for leadership. Both妄想号召有众，卒为万众共弃之独夫, which I am unsure of how to translate but will offer the raw pinyin: "Wang xiang hao zhao you zhong, zu wei wan zhong gong qi zhi du fu." Both revealed their madness in the guise of profoundity. These similarities make the two events quite similar.

At the time of the Xi'an Incident, everyone thought it was mysterious and vicious. After analysis, those who knew better laughed at it. Wang Jingwei's achievement will only amount to material for future generations to laugh at. Wang is a narrow-minded person who holds stubborn opinions about people and things and cannot tolerate others. He secretly considers himself a genius. Therefore, after he had a start in politics, his knowledge made no further progress. Fundamentally, he is not a great man, and he is blinded by his own intelligence. Therefore, he only has the possibility of lacking common sense and has no opportunity to nurture profound insights. Take his previous criticisms of the scorched-earth policy and guerrilla warfare as examples to prove the depth of his prejudices and his inability to progress. Furthermore, read Chairman Chiang's instruction on the 26th and Wang Jingwei's telegram on the 29th to know that the telegram has no research value. As for China's military affairs, they have always been planned and directed by Chairman Chiang. Those who participate in some military affairs only know some of the actual situation, and those who do not participate in military affairs know nothing. This is because military affairs are very different from politics. Politics is open and honest, and one can see the big picture from the small. Military affairs do not consider deception immoral, but consider absolute secrecy a condition for success. Now that those in charge of military affairs have confidence in winning the war, no one has the right to deny this confidence. Since they know nothing and have no qualifications, they still raise their heads and stretch their eyebrows, as if they are about to "sell the wind, clouds, thunder, and rain." What true knowledge and insight do they have? All one sees is their duplicity. As for the existence of certain factions and groups, this is a fact. However, those who call themselves parties or groups based on ideology have already returned to the banner of the Kuomintang's Three Principles of the People in order to resist the war. Therefore, these so-called factions and groups must have no meaning for the benefit of the country and the well-being of the people. It is believed that in recent years, Chairman Chiang's sincerity has moved those who are capable to dedicate themselves to the country and obey the leader. Therefore, the factions and groups of the past have gradually disappeared. This is certainly true in the military. Given Wang Jingwei's narrow-minded character, his lack of progress in knowledge, and his repeated reversals over the past decade, he has long been disbelieved by the talented and knowledgeable, let alone the masses. Those who follow him for the sake of rank and wealth certainly exist, but what kind of people are they? They are incapable and without power. To say that they can influence events is either a self-deception of being pretentious or a deception of others. Chongqing has resolved to expel him from the party, and Tokyo has not yet expressed its desire to recruit a traitor. Therefore, although Wang Jingwei is very self-important and seeks to save himself, his objective evaluation is very minor. How much damage does his rebellion cause to China's war of resistance? Then, is Wang Jingwei not completely foolish? He believed that the telegram on the 29th would lead the Chinese people to regard him as the national leader, the puppet regimes in the north and south would welcome him as the head of state, the Japanese government and public would respect him as a representative of a friendly country, and Germany, Italy, Britain, and France would praise him as the god of peace. Isn't this a great imagination? It is no accident that he dreamed of making a splash; however it was an event that turned out to be a "damp squib!" Who would have expected that?

### Anglo-American Response to the Far East Situation: Considering Economic Pressure on Japan, Believing Japan's Weak Financial Position Makes it Easy to Succeed, US Public Opinion Tending Towards Further Action

(London) Well-informed sources here have recently stated that after Ambassador Craigie's decisive talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita regarding the protection of British interests in China yielded no results, and as anxieties in the United States regarding its interests in China have also increased, the British Foreign Office is considering retaliatory measures against Japanese commerce by both Britain and the United States, and the two sides are exchanging opinions. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

(London) Regarding the protection of interests in China, the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, which yielded no results. The Foreign Office authorities have already considered countermeasures, generally believing that directly pressuring Japan to change its attitude is unlikely to succeed. It is more appropriate to apply retaliatory measures to Japanese commerce within the territories of the British Empire. Britain can inflict significant blows on Japanese commerce in its territories without resorting to illegal means. The US government has reportedly expressed no objection to taking retaliatory measures in the economic sphere. As such, the final decision of the British government will inevitably be influenced by the attitude of the United States. Information received here from Tokyo also confirms two things: (1) Japan's economic situation is increasingly difficult, and (2) Japan's military position in China is not as strong as described in its official announcements. Furthermore, the pro-peace telegram from Wang Jingwei is not taken seriously here, as it is not believed to have any impact on General Chiang Kai-shek personally or on the future of the war. Therefore, if Britain desires fair treatment for its interests in China, it can take economic action, and such action is likely to succeed due to Japan's economic vulnerability. It goes without saying. The detailed plan is being carefully studied by the relevant departments of the Foreign Office, and will be submitted for review when Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax return to London (at the end of this week). However, thorough consideration can only be given after the Prime Minister's visit to Rome and the Foreign Secretary's attendance at the League of Nations Council meeting (opening on the 16th of this month). (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

(Washington) According to sources here, the US government intends to submit to Congress various materials demonstrating the extent to which the Japanese military discriminates against American commerce in the occupied territories of China. Subsequent actions will be determined by the strength of the sentiment expressed by Congress and the nation. (According to reliable sources obtained by Reuters, President Roosevelt will not exercise the powers granted to him by Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 unless he feels that the entire nation supports it. However, if the public entrusts him with this power, the government is prepared to implement a retaliatory plan. This clause authorizes the President to impose high tariffs on imports from any country that discriminates against American commerce, and even to prohibit the entry of goods from other countries carried by vessels of the discriminating country. If the other party continues to discriminate after implementing such measures, the President has the right to prohibit all trade with that country. It is said that a few years ago, a European country discriminated against American commerce, and the United States only made this threat, and the country immediately ceased its discrimination. At that time, the proposed order was shown to the ambassador of that country, who telegraphed it to his home government, and they then yielded. According to reliable sources, the US government does not want to take such drastic steps immediately, but responsible sources claim that if American public opinion remains strong against this repeatedly provocative behavior, the government will not hesitate to go to extremes, especially because American commerce, educational, and charitable undertakings in the Japanese-occupied areas of China are still being deliberately damaged by the Japanese. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)

Pittman's Statement

(Washington) Regarding the issue of maintaining the Nine-Power Treaty in Washington, after the US government presented two resolute notes to Japan, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also made a statement to the press, saying, "If Japan does not provide a satisfactory reply, the US government will impose retaliatory measures on that country, especially prohibiting the import of Japanese goods into the United States. According to the current tariff law, President Roosevelt already has the power to issue such a ban, and can also request that Congress pass a resolution prohibiting the export of American goods to Japan to achieve complete success." The Japanese side may retaliate in some way, such as severing diplomatic relations with the United States, but will not declare war on the United States. "We know very well that Japan cannot invade our country from across the Pacific Ocean," he said. Although Pittman's statement was made in his personal capacity, well-informed sources believe that if Japan cannot provide a satisfactory reply, the US attitude will definitely become increasingly tough, which can be seen from this statement. In addition, Pittman's statement was made on the eve of the resumption of Congress, and its special importance is self-evident. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

Britain Will Follow in America's Footsteps

(London) The British Foreign Office is considering sending a note to Tokyo similar to the US note of December 31 as a final note. The content of the US note to Japan rejects any unilateral settlement of the China issue by Japan and proposes inviting Japan to participate in an international conference to jointly seek a solution to the Far East problem. According to British sources, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie recently discussed the issues in the US note to Japan with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Officials here said, "We fully sympathize with the US note and believe that this note has been designated as 'final' by the Washington authorities." In addition, the main points of the US note to Japan are divided into three main points: (1) The United States refuses to recognize any unilateral settlement of the China issue by Japan; (2) The United States invites Japan to participate in an international conference to jointly seek a solution to the Far East problem with the major powers concerned with China; (3) The United States will, regardless of any announcements by the Japanese government or Japanese puppet organizations in China, reserve all rights and interests of Americans in China. (Associated Press dispatch, 2nd)

(London) The British newspapers attach great importance to the recent US note to Japan. The Washington correspondent of "The Times" said that when the note was released to the American newspapers, it was accompanied by a notice stating, "This note must be regarded as a fundamental summary of all disputes in previous notes from the United States." This article aims to end the empty talk on this matter. The Washington correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" also said that American officials are increasingly feeling that in order to deal with the current situation, there must be more action beyond "non-recognition." What the United States does not recognize is Japan's right to establish a new order in China. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

### Full Text of the US Note to Japan

(Chongqing) The United States previously sent a very long and strongly worded note to the Japanese government on October 6 of last year, because Japan violated the principle of the Open Door and Equal Opportunity in China. Japan replied on November 18 of last year, still arguing sophistically. The US side believed that it was not satisfactory, and sent another note to Japan on the 31st of last month, reiterating the views of the US government. The reports in the newspapers these days have been very brief. Now, the reporter translates and publishes the original telegram of this note, which was forwarded by the relevant parties. Even if there are still some omissions, it should not be far from the full text of the note.

The note stated, "It is undoubtedly true that the Japanese side has restricted the actions and business operations of the American people, placed the interests of the Japanese in a superior position, and discriminated against the legitimate interests of the American side. The US government firmly believes that restricting businesses, such as foreign exchange controls, mandatory circulation of banknotes, and revising tariffs, as well as advocating monopolies regardless of the elimination of rights already acquired by other countries, are neither fair nor just, and violate the provisions of certain international agreements. The Japanese side has repeatedly guaranteed to respect the principle of equal opportunity, and Japan has also undertaken the obligation to abide by this principle in treaties. The US government has therefore requested the Japanese side to abide by this obligation and fulfill its guarantees in practice. The Japanese government's reply seems to make the US government's understanding of the new situation and new order planned and created by the Japanese authorities in East Asia a condition for respecting the aforementioned principle. This kind of arbitrary assumption that the US government should recognize the new situation and new order claimed by the Japanese authorities as valid in order for the American people to enjoy the general rights they have already acquired in China without discriminatory treatment is questionable. The American people's compliance with and advocacy of the principle of equal opportunity is not only for obtaining commercial benefits, but also for hoping to obtain economic and political stability, so as to eliminate international friction and malice and open up trade routes. However, this principle has been clearly agreed to by the Japanese side in the past, and has been recognized in various international agreements and international understandings for a long time. The US government and people cannot agree to any third country unilaterally creating a system for various special purposes to forcibly cancel its long-acquired rights to equal opportunity and fair treatment. The US government and people enjoy the aforementioned various legitimate and fair rights together with the governments and people of other countries, and the basic principles such as equal opportunity have long been recognized as good, fair, and natural principles and have been universally adopted, so they cannot be invalidated by unilateral statements. The Japanese government's note implies that past ideas and principles need to be modified in light of the current and future situation in the Far East. The US government now wishes to reiterate to the Japanese government its views on amending the agreement. The US government and people believe that when a certain situation involves the rights, obligations, and legitimate interests of other sovereign countries, no country has the right to arbitrarily implement its intentions without the consent of all the countries concerned. Treaties have provisions for amending clauses. Therefore, the United States cannot recognize the fact that one of the parties to the agreement, as expressed by the actions and official statements of its officials, is unwilling to abide by the promises of the treaty and the vested rights of other countries, and attempts to arbitrarily take measures to create a new order in the Far East. No matter what changes have occurred in the past, or what the current situation is, the US government is equally concerned about the situation that existed in the past, and the changes that may occur in the future, even if these changes may promote a new situation and a new order, are equally of concern to the US government now and in the future. The US government is also aware that some changes have been created by the Japanese side, but the US government cannot recognize that any country arbitrarily stipulates the conditions and circumstances of a new order in areas outside its sovereignty and considers itself the source of power and the master of fate in that area. Restrictions on tariff autonomy and extraterritoriality have been separately removed through negotiations and agreements due to changes in the situation, and are being removed. The US government has always believed that agreements can be amended, but it always insists that it can only be done through the legal procedures of negotiation and agreement. The Japanese government has also repeatedly held the same view. All rights and obligations of the United States in international relations originate from international law and are generated based on treaties concluded in good faith. The US government and people cannot agree to the arbitrary actions of officials or authorities of third countries to cancel any rights and obligations of the United States. However, the US government has always been and is still prepared to give considerable and full consideration to any suggestions based on justice and law and proposed by the countries concerned through free negotiation and re-acceptance, so as to solve various problems and give due consideration to the rights and obligations of all countries concerned. The Japanese government inherently and now has the opportunity to make such proposals. If such proposals are made by representatives of other countries whose rights and obligations are related, including China and Japan, the US government has been and is still willing to engage in discussions anywhere. At the same time, the US government reserves all current American rights, and will never agree to those rights being infringed upon." (Dispatch, 3rd)

Sexual Health

### Weakness of the Kidneys Is...

— Written by Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical Department

The Destroyer of Family Peace

Do you want to build a fulfilling family? To give birth to healthy offspring? To grow old together with your spouse? The first condition is that you must pay attention to the physical and mental health of both parties. If the health status of both family lines is not thoroughly investigated before marriage, and one of the spouses develops health problems after marriage, various tragedies will inevitably occur—the most unfortunate divorce between couples, although the reasons are very complex, what particularly attracts our attention is the neurasthenia of the kidneys between couples. No matter how passionate their love is, once this condition occurs, their love will naturally cool down, and the peace of the family will naturally be shattered. Not only that, even if both spouses are healthy—the kidney function is not abnormal—they cannot fully obtain the joy of nature, and the result is that there is no possibility of giving birth to healthy successors. Such a family, filled with gloomy, silent atmosphere, is the supreme suffering in life!

Therefore, if we want to seek family happiness and the joy of life, we must pay full attention to the outbreak of this disease. If one or both spouses have impaired kidney function, we must quickly correct it with medical knowledge. Then, this sexual knowledge is indispensable for anyone.

Post-marital kidney dysfunction can generally be divided into three types: disease-related, age-related, and spousal fatigue. The so-called disease-related factors are purely due to excessive masturbation before marriage, and debauchery, leading to underdevelopment, kidney atrophy, and other diseases. The second is sexual dysfunction due to age, which is most common in middle-aged husbands. Because the youth glands that govern the kidneys gradually decrease in vitality with age, middle-aged men have weaker interest and enthusiasm for marital relations than young people. If they indulge in lust during their youth, they will lose this natural function in middle age. As for marital fatigue, it is often caused by disagreements between the two parties or dissatisfaction with the other's appearance. Therefore, this is most common in young people who are fond of novelty and tire of the old, and whose love is not dedicated. Consequently, the greatest happiness and joy of living together as a couple cannot be fully enjoyed!

In summary, there are many reasons for post-marital kidney dysfunction, but the most common is pathological reasons. Therefore, the most important treatment method is to increase essence and nourish blood. Unfortunately, the preparations on the market all claim to treat sexual neurasthenia, and patients and doctors are confused about how to choose. In particular, the ingredients in tonic drugs are mostly temporary stimulants, which cause many problems after use. Therefore, if one does not think about safe and fundamental treatment, but wants a permanent solution, one must choose preparations made from the essence of the testicles of truly strong animals, which can produce miraculous effects. I especially like to use "Complimenton" from Germany. This preparation is made entirely from the youth gland extracts of chimpanzees, cattle, and sheep, and is infused with mineral and plant ingredients that nourish the brain and blood, so the effect is the best. It is indeed a great savior for those with kidney atrophy!

### Nocturnal Emission Requires Immediate Treatment!

— Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany

All diseases have their causes. There is a cause and an effect. And when the symptoms appear, they often become the cause in reverse. For example, nocturnal emission leads to kidney deficiency. And those with kidney deficiency are less able to control their essence, and nocturnal emission becomes more frequent. Those who suffer from neurasthenia due to kidney deficiency experience frequent nocturnal emissions because the neurasthenia causes the fire of the gate of vitality to become excessive, and desires are difficult to control, even to the point of spermatorrhea with the slightest stimulation. The first step in treating this disease is to stop the nocturnal emission. Therefore, one should start by strengthening the spermatic cord. "Ners' Nocturnal Emission Pills," invented by the German venereal disease expert Ners, are a specific medicine for fundamentally curing nocturnal emission. Further taking "Complimenton" to nourish the deficiencies and eliminate neurasthenia will eradicate all kinds of weakness like sweeping away fallen leaves in an instant. Speaking of the efficacy of the "Ners' Nocturnal Emission Pills," after repeated trials, I have found them to be unmatched by other preparations.

Modern Medicine

### Ironclad Fact: The Test Tube Experiment for Gonorrhea Medication

— Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine from the United States

Many old gonorrhea treatments have been proven ineffective by modern expert doctors and patients. Therefore, the research on new treatments is rampant in the entire medical community. Scholars bury themselves in work, exhausting countless efforts and brainpower. Finally, a truth for treating gonorrhea was discovered in the test tube, which shocked the entire medical world for a time. It is generally believed to be the greatest harvest in the treatment of gonorrhea. At that time, I was studying medicine in the United States, determined to study and read widely in medical journals published in Europe and the United States. I learned that it was a new method based on the latest science, which extracted pure pigments and protein bodies, and mixed them with other mild but powerful bactericidal chemicals to make a solution. When used to soak gonococci, the gonococci were seen to die quickly.

Many scholars, such as Dr. Jauregg (1912), Dr. R. Rrans (1914.1917), and Dr. R. Schmidt (1916), who are all university professors and gonorrhea specialists, have also repeatedly tested the agent and proved its great effectiveness. The gonococci in the slant culture medium in the test tube are usually very active and lively. If this medicinal solution is injected into the test tube, all the gonococci are immediately seen to die. Later, Dr. Peter took it a step further and made the pure yellow pigment and special protein bodies into an oral medicine "Kelinnong" using precise disinfection procedures. From then on, the treatment of gonorrhea opened a new world.

This medicine can fundamentally cure all kinds of acute and chronic gonorrhea in men and women, such as acute and chronic balanitis, prostatitis, orchitis, cystitis, and arthritis in men, and vulvitis, vaginitis, cervicitis, oophoritis, and gonorrheal leukorrhea in women. Its speed and accuracy have long been praised. If women have gonorrheal leukorrhea, they can use "Carols Shetti Vaginal Tablets" as a suppository, inserting one tablet into the vagina every night before going to bed and washing it off the next morning. Men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, washing the urethra according to the instructions and illustrations, and secretly treating themselves at home. The speed of the effect will surely exceed expectations, and it is better than treatment at a general doctor's office. This is the conclusion I have reached from my clinical experience over the past ten years. (Note: "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is sold at both Zhongxi Taihe Drugstore)

### The Story of Lung Disease Recovery

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Today's lung disease treatment, in European countries, pulmonary relaxation therapy is popular. According to expert reports, after taking "Shenfei Nael" orally, it can indeed achieve the above-mentioned purpose, because the basis for the preparation of this medicine is based on this rule. Therefore, after taking it, the lungs are relaxed in three hours, the cavities are contracted, and as a result, the therapeutic bacteria lose their range of activity and die one after another. Therefore, no matter what stage of lung disease, even if it reaches the final stage, the power of "Bufei Nael" will make the appetite increase, breathing smooth, and cough, night fever, and night sweats will all disappear without a trace.

### Gonorrhea Yima Constellation

— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road Treatment after the disappearance of acute gonorrhea symptoms

If gonorrhea can be treated early, it can avoid a long period of difficult and distressed life, but unfortunately, if gonorrhea is not treated properly in the early stage (acute stage), and it becomes chronic gonorrhea, it is also a blessing in disguise for gonorrhea patients if they can receive appropriate treatment from a formal doctor. However, the most taboo thing is to think that the disease has become chronic, and then give up on oneself and refuse to seek effective treatment. As a result, it will inevitably become chronic gonorrhea and become a lifelong burden. Can you not plan for it early?

The so-called treatment after the disappearance of acute gonorrhea symptoms means that appropriate treatment is applied after the acute symptoms of gonorrhea gradually disappear, so as to avoid turning into chronic gonorrhea. After the second or third week of acute gonorrhea, all the symptoms of thought, such as the gradual disappearance of pain, and the gradual recovery of secretions and inflammation, are relieved. At that time, the patient only sees thick purulent secretions at the urethral opening in the early morning.

During this period, a higher concentration of Protargolum should be used, followed by German static electricity therapy and oral gonorrhea medicine "Kelinnong" to make the patient's cells produce anti-gonorrhea phagocytic effects, and at the same time, after these therapies, because the medicine exerts a bactericidal effect, there must be a decision to secrete pus, but this is a necessary condition for treating gonorrhea. When I treat this disease, I always explain it to the patient in advance, so when I apply it, the patient does not find it strange. For example, Mr. Nie Yiwu, who lives on North Xizang Road. He originally suffered from acute gonorrhea, but the treatment was not effective, so he was not completely cured. He begged me to treat him. After I applied the above-mentioned medicines and therapies and explained the situation after the medicine, he happily obeyed. After the second week, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" was used to kill gonococci and exert an anti-inflammatory effect, so that the re-emergence of epithelial cells, three weeks of treatment, urination was clear, and all other symptoms were completely cured. Consultation hours are from 10 am to 6 pm From today onwards, send 20 numbers for consultation every day, and each number only costs 5 cents

### Cabinet Turmoil in Japan: Konoe Prepares to Step Down; Hiranuma Most Popular Choice to Succeed; Suetsugu's Political Mobilization Plan Hits a Wall

(Tokyo) According to well-informed sources here, Prime Minister Konoe has decided to submit his cabinet's resignation this week due to the outcome of the year-end multi-decision conference. Baron Kiichirō Hiranuma, President of the Privy Council, is the most likely candidate to succeed him. It is said that the reason for the cabinet turmoil stems from Interior Minister Suetsugu's insistence on a national political mobilization based on his own ideas. Suetsugu is known for his fascist tendencies, and if his proposed plan were adopted, all political parties would be merged into one. While both the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties support a national spiritual mobilization, they strongly oppose Suetsugu's plan. It is rumored that Suetsugu has threatened to forcibly dissolve the Diet. If that happens, the ordinary budget and the 6 billion yuan budget for the Sino-Japanese War will not be passed by the Diet, which would cause great financial chaos in Japan during wartime. For this reason, Konoe prefers to resign before the Diet reconvenes on January 24. (Reuters, 3rd)

(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese cabinet is scheduled to hold its first meeting of the year tomorrow. According to observers here, the plan to strengthen the Japanese cabinet will be realized within a day or two. (3rd)

(Tokyo) According to informed sources, government leaders here have been consulting each other busily in recent days, and this will continue this week. Although no specific facts have been disclosed, it is widely believed that this is related to the imminent cabinet reshuffle. It is rumored that a necessary decision will be made before the 10th of this month. In addition to the heads of the defense departments, Finance Minister Ikeda, the Minister of Education, and the Minister of Health and Welfare are also participating in the discussions. However, Interior Minister Suetsugu is not involved. According to observers, the President of the Privy Council has held several talks with the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal in recent days. The Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal represents the Emperor and Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe and other cabinet members, and conducts talks with them. Political figures solemnly declare that the sole purpose of this cabinet reshuffle is to achieve close contact and unified will among all cabinet members. (Haitong, 3rd)

### Enormous Japanese Military Expenditure; Small Businesses Close Down One After Another; Domestic Unemployment Soars

(Tokyo) According to Japanese newspapers, the special budget for the next fiscal year, including the war expenses for China, will greatly exceed the current year's figure, equivalent to £59 million. The total amount of the new budget is equivalent to £353 million, compared to £294 million in the previous year. (Reuters, 3rd)

(Tokyo) In 1939, the lives of the Japanese working masses will become even more difficult because the ruling class insists on continuing the protracted war in China. This war has severely damaged Japan's economy, causing tens of thousands of businesses to close down. The number of unemployed has increased to 2 million. Taxes have increased to 4 billion yuan. Various necessities such as textiles, cigarettes, tea, coffee, and soap are all subject to heavy taxes. In 1939, the Japanese working masses will have to bear 6 billion yuan in military expenses for the invasion of China, while also having to drastically reduce their consumption of goods. (Express News Agency, 3rd)

### China's Resistance War Becomes More United; British Newspapers Optimistic About the Situation in the Far East

(London) Today, newspapers here are more optimistic about the situation in the Far East. A Financial Times editorial states that the increasingly firm attitude of the United States towards Japan and the granting of credit for the purchase of goods gives those whose financial and commercial interests in China are currently harmed the hope that the US government will eventually take a tougher stance. The US credit line, following the British loan, is particularly important from the perspective of the Chinese people's spirit of resistance, even though the amount is not large. Without this kind of assistance, Wang Jingwei's advocacy of peace with Japan would be more powerful. However, as the situation is constantly changing and the war is still ongoing, British and American assistance should be swift. To maintain the key factors of the Chinese government and the Open Door Policy, those whose interests are affected must carefully consider this position and act quickly. The Birmingham Post claims that, according to the information it has obtained, the Japanese believe that Wang Jingwei's defection is the starting point for the collapse of Chinese unity. This is purely wishful thinking on the part of the Japanese. In fact, Wang Jingwei's departure can strengthen the unity of the government, and there is no sign that China's spirit of resistance has been affected by his telegrams. According to the observers' recent impressions, China's determination to resist has been strengthened by the economic assistance from Britain and the United States. (Reuters, 3rd)

### German Newspapers Criticize the International Situation; The Far East and Europe Compared

(Berlin) The main issues commented on by the German newspapers in the New Year are two: the Mediterranean problem and the Far East dispute. The "Berliner Tageblatt" compares the Spanish Civil War with the Far East dispute, stating, "All parties hope that the Spanish problem can be resolved as soon as possible. When British Prime Minister Chamberlain goes to Rome in mid-month to talk with the Italian authorities, he will use this issue as the starting point for the talks. As for the Far East, the Japanese side has declared this year as the 'Year of Diplomacy', which is evidenced by the fact that Wang Jingwei and Doihara have begun negotiations, which they believe to be reliable." At this point, the newspaper further states, "Jewish capitalism and Bolshevik revolution are both conspiring in the world." This is the world's first crisis. The nations of Europe have awakened, and the Far East is also showing signs of awakening. There is no need for Western countries to give instructions. On the contrary, the dark forces in the Americas want to use the torch in the hand of the Statue of Liberty in New York to ignite a prairie fire around the world. (Havas, 3rd)

### Franco-Soviet Trade Agreement Extended for One Year

(Moscow) Semi-official sources recently announced that the Franco-Soviet trade agreement (established on January 6, 1936), which expired on December 31 last year, has been extended for one year after negotiations between representatives of both sides in Paris, without any revisions. (Havas, 2nd)

Belarus Expresses Loyalty; Sends Telegram to Soviet Authorities

(Moscow) The Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, bordering Poland, sent telegrams to Stalin, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov, and Defense Commissar Voroshilov, expressing loyalty, on the occasion of celebrating the 20th anniversary of its declaration of republic. Voroshilov replied that the entire Soviet Union is prepared to fight for socialism and independence, and will defeat all enemies. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Fascist Party Convenes a Congress; Prime Minister to Deliver a Speech

(Rome) The Fascist National Council is scheduled to convene today. The agenda is not yet known, but it is expected that Prime Minister Mussolini will deliver a speech on the diplomatic situation. On this day fourteen years ago, Mussolini delivered a speech in the Italian Parliament that determined the Fascist revolution and the realization of the Italian Empire. (Haitong, 3rd)

### A Coffin Sent to the British Prime Minister's Residence; But Prevented by the Police; Unemployed Masses Call for Relief

(London) Participants in the National Unemployed Workers' Movement today attempted to deliver a coffin containing an umbrella to the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, but were prevented by the police. As the clock struck, a large car with tightly closed doors drove into Downing Street and went directly to the door of the Prime Minister's residence. A person jumped out of the car, went to the door and spoke to the doorman of the residence. At this time, the people in the car carried a coffin out of the car and prepared to carry it into the residence. The coffin was black, painted with white characters that read "The coffin of unemployed people who requested relief in vain." Several policemen saw this, stepped forward, stopped them, and put the coffin back on the car, ordering them to drive away. At the same time, hundreds of unemployed people gathered in Downing Street, loudly demanding winter relief. However, British Prime Minister Chamberlain was spending his New Year holiday at his villa, so he did not witness this commotion. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Radio Broadcasts Pictures and Sound; Television Broadcasts Reach 3,000 Miles Away; - Amazing Achievements of the Scientific Community -

(London) The British television films broadcast from Alexandra Palace in London can actually be seen and heard in New York. This amazing news was telegraphed to the British Broadcasting Corporation by the New York Jiangtou Radio Station. The company only guarantees that this television broadcast can be received within 25 to 30 miles. Now it can be received as far as 3,000 miles away in New York, which is a rare event in the wireless electricity industry. It is generally believed that this amazing achievement was achieved due to the particularly good weather conditions on that day. (Reuters, 3rd)

### French Prime Minister Arrives in Tunis; Inspects North African Defenses; The People Welcome Him Enthusiastically; Corsicans Pledge Loyalty to the Motherland

French Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier, accompanied by Army Chief of Staff General Georges, Air Force Chief of Staff General Vuillemin, Navy Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Darlan, Commander of the Tunisian Garrison General Blanc, Commander of the Bizerte Fortress Lieutenant General Bréard, and many French and indigenous dignitaries, arrived in Tunis, French North Africa, at 12:15 this afternoon. The residents shouted "Long live France" and "Long live Daladier" repeatedly and for a long time. The cordon set up near the Governor's Office was broken through by the crowd. The enthusiastic welcome of the people can be seen. Prime Minister Daladier then went to the tombs of the war dead to lay wreaths. At 12:40 p.m., he went to the "French Building" to attend a banquet hosted by Governor Labonne. Then, at 3:30 p.m., he inspected the garrison in the city and watched an air show. (Havas, 3rd)

Bizerte: French Prime Minister Daladier arrived here today from Bastia. Twelve submarines and a flotilla of torpedo boats participated in the welcome. Another squadron of seaplanes soared in the sky. After Daladier landed, the people welcomed him enthusiastically. Indigenous troops lined the streets he passed, and the cheers were deafening. Women threw flowers from the windows to show their respect. After Daladier attended the reception hosted by the local officials, he took a car to inspect a fort on the defense line protecting Bizerte. Daladier will now go to Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, where he will be greeted by 76-year-old Governor Sidi Ahmed. Ahmed will present him with a "Blood Oath Badge," after which Daladier can be called Ahmed's sworn brother. After Daladier conducts a grand review at noon tomorrow, he will inspect the Mareth Line, which protects the Libyan border. France recently dispatched a large number of reinforcements to the Libyan border. (Reuters, 3rd)

Bastia, capital of Corsica: Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier arrived in this port at 3:30 this afternoon aboard the cruiser "Admiral Foch". Navy Minister Campinchi, former cabinet members Pietri and Landri (both Corsicans), and the senators and deputies elected from the island, who came to welcome the Prime Minister from Ajaccio aboard the cruisers "Suffren" and "Colbert", arrived at 3:10 p.m. The chairman of the Bastia City Council, Mondola, and other officials welcomed him at the port. When the Prime Minister landed by boat, the gun salutes and military music sounded in unison. Three young women presented flowers to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister then inspected the troops at the pier. At that time, the military band played the national anthem, and the crowd sang along in unison. The singing was deafening. After twenty minutes, the number of people gathering outside the pier increased, finally breaking through the cordon and rushing into the pier, shouting "Long live France" and "Long live Daladier." At this time, the Prime Minister went to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to lay wreaths and observe a moment of silence amidst the thronging crowd. Van Larese, Chairman of the Island Veterans Association, raised his hand and swore, "We swear to live as Corsicans and die as French ghosts." The crowd heard this and shouted in unison, "We swear." Prime Minister Daladier then went to the Municipal Theater to attend a reception. The Chairman of the City Council, Mondola, also delivered a welcoming speech, emphasizing that Corsica and France have an unshakable connection. If France is threatened in its territory or in its colonies, Corsicans are prepared to sacrifice themselves for the country again, as they did in the last World War. The Prime Minister also gave a brief reply, expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome of the people, and speaking of national unity. He then re-boarded the cruiser "Admiral Foch" at 5:00 p.m. and transferred to Tunis. (Havas, 2nd)

### Italian Newspapers Accuse France of Deliberate Provocation

(Rome) Newspapers here have sharply criticized the French Prime Minister's visit to Tunis and Corsica, considering it an anti-Italian demonstration. "Il Regime Fascista" commented, "Daladier does not strive to resolve the differences between the two countries, but instead exacerbates them and goes into a corner." "Il Giornale d'Italia" commented with the headline "Corsica is an Italian Island," saying that the current demonstration cannot change the language, culture, and customs of Corsica, as these have always been related to Italy, just as Tuscany is. Italy disregards and ignores the protests made by France regarding "Latin civilization" and "Latin friendship." This is not only a failure to understand Italy's expectations, but also a deliberate provocation. (Haitong, 3rd)

### Berlin Officials Remain Silent

(Berlin) Here, attention is being paid to French Prime Minister Daladier's tour of the colonies, but officials are very silent about it, apparently unwilling to make many statements about it at this time. The remarks of a Hamburg newspaper seem to reflect the opinion of the German political world, saying that France's current diplomacy is no different from the past, as it is attempting to create an exaggerated and uncompromising attitude at the beginning in order to gain a favorable position. The relationship between Italy and France has become a European problem. If people overseas can understand the meaning of the clear and unbreakable obligations that have arisen in the German-Italian relationship, that is, what the German leader is currently advocating, then Germany's attitude towards the Mediterranean problem will never be misunderstood. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Abyssinia Seething with Resentment; Italian Troops Use Force; Not Yet Completely Conquered

(Paris) A telegram received here from Djibouti, the capital of French Somaliland, states that a movement to boycott Italian goods to protect the economic life of Djibouti seems to be brewing. Transportation managers have received telegram orders to quickly transport all Italian goods to Abyssinia. At the same time, the Italian Consul General in Djibouti has departed for Rome. The local people are currently quite calm, but according to French sources, Abyssinia is seeing its economic life deteriorate due to a lack of cash, and resentment is seething. Apart from a few major centers, the Italian army has not yet been able to conquer Abyssinia. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Germany Demands Naval Expansion; Britain Feels Threatened

(London) Well-informed sources here recently stated that the German government's attitude is very firm regarding Germany's invocation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of June 18, 1935, to demand that the total tonnage of submarines be increased to be equal to that of Britain, and its invocation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of July 13, 1937, to demand that the number of capital cruisers be increased from five to seven. It will not allow any concessions and will submit a note within days explaining the reasons and notifying Britain of the measures it has actually taken. In order to deal with this, the British naval authorities are said to have considered the following two methods: (1) building many small warships of 500 to 1,000 tons, equipped with four-inch, seven-caliber cannons, to shoot at submarines or aircraft; (2) building more than 30 submarine defense ships in the next few months. The above two types of small warships will be used to protect commercial routes and to fight against individually operating submarines. In addition, many existing destroyers are being renovated and will also be equipped with new weapons to defend against submarines and aircraft. The details of all these plans will be revealed when the Admiralty publishes its budget in late February or early March. (Havas, 2nd)

### British Cabinet Turmoil Expected to Be Avoided; Chamberlain Trusts Secretary of War; Factions Unite to Form New Party

(London) According to Reuters' parliamentary correspondent, the actions of some government supporters who were dissatisfied with the three cabinet members' dissatisfaction with national defense issues at the end of last month seem to have disappeared invisibly. The leaders of this matter were Major Airdmanson, a supporter of the government faction in the Conservative Party, and Marquis Doufflin, a colonial decision official. The reason was dissatisfaction with the adjustment of British national defense. It is rumored that two of the five young cabinet members who supported Airdmanson's actions have written to the Prime Minister to state that the declaration they issued on this matter was not their personal opinion and solemnly declared that they did not sympathize with external criticisms. In addition, two others have personally apologized to the Prime Minister, so only the above four will continue to serve. As for Prime Minister Chamberlain himself, he is very satisfied with the situation of rearmament and expresses complete trust in Secretary of War Hore-Belisha. (Reuters, 2nd)

(London) It is reported that leaders of various parties who are uneasy about the diplomatic policies promoted by the Chamberlain cabinet and the inadequacy of British armaments will unite to form a new party in a short period of time. According to those in charge of this matter, "This new party will be organized by members of various parties who have independent opinions and are concerned about the state of British national defense and current diplomatic policies. Most Members of Parliament, including some members of the government faction, support this movement. A secret meeting is scheduled to be held in London on the 4th of this month to put forward a preliminary plan. This move cannot be regarded as an anti-Chamberlain movement. Its ultimate goal is to complete a greater unified situation and form a true national cabinet." It is rumored that former Foreign Secretary Eden has nothing to do with this matter. People in the government believe that the people who can be won over by this new organization will be limited to second-tier members of the Liberal and Conservative parties. The Labour Party may not participate because it is unwilling to establish a Popular Front. Randolph Churchill (name), son of Conservative extreme right-wing leader Churchill, his son-in-law Sandys, Conservative MP Macmillan, and Liberal MP and famous journalist Patrick, are all said to support this movement. (Havas, 2nd)

(London) After spending a few days with Lord Swinton, the former Secretary of Air, at Lord Swinton's villa in Ely, Prime Minister Chamberlain transferred to Elveden Hall this afternoon and was entertained by the Earl of Iveagh. He is scheduled to stay for three or four days before returning to the capital. It is rumored that the Prime Minister met with Foreign Secretary Halifax in Garopaba town and former Foreign Secretary Eden in Kulk Teller town when he was a guest in Ely. The Prime Minister denied this, saying, "I have other opportunities to discuss various issues with the Foreign Secretary, so there is no need for such detours. In short, my trip to Ely has no political function." (Havas, 2nd)

### US Congress Reconvenes Yesterday; Roosevelt to Submit Message; Main Goal is Expanding Military Buildup; Fascist Group's Power Extends; The United States Has Serious Concerns

(Washington) The 76th US Congress convened here today and will discuss many critically important events. The President's message will be read tomorrow, which will likely emphasize that, given the deteriorating international relations, the US should urgently strengthen its preparations. It will also describe President Roosevelt's "Western Hemisphere Defense" program and expand the Monroe Doctrine, so that all countries in the New Hemisphere can jointly defend North and South America. It is expected that President Roosevelt will advocate that the US Army and Air Force should bear the responsibility for this vast program for many years to come. President Roosevelt will also advocate greatly expanding the existing military buildup program. President Roosevelt will also express his serious concerns about the increasing spread of authoritarianism. Although he will not name one or two countries that have concluded anti-communist pacts, he will likely indicate that, as Japan strives to be the "Lord of the Far East," Italy strives to expand in the Mediterranean, and Germany harbors ambitions for Eastern Europe and Ukraine, and the three powers are working together to seize markets and political convenience in South America, the United States has no choice but to strengthen its military to the best of its ability and to the extent that it does not endanger its internal economy. (Reuters, 3rd)

(Washington) The 76th US Congress, scheduled to open tomorrow, will focus on expanding military preparations and the diplomatic situation. Regarding the issue of military preparations, President Roosevelt will regularly submit messages to Congress, providing detailed explanations for the reasons for strengthening national defense, especially the plan to strengthen the air force, and advocating that the US Air Force should be on par with the strongest air force in the world, and even surpass it. Regarding the diplomatic issue, since the Munich Agreement, US public opinion had once completely leaned towards isolationism, but then advocated that a coalition of democratic countries should implement a collective security system, and expressed its support for the government's anti-authoritarian policy. This policy can be seen in the tension between the US and Germany and the US's efforts to organize a united front at the 8th Pan-American Conference. However, some members of Congress fear that President Roosevelt will use the support of public opinion to arbitrarily preside over diplomatic policy on a broader scale, resulting in a reduction of congressional power. They are bound to attack certain issues, one of which is the Neutrality Act. This law is scheduled to expire on May 1 of this year and must be amended before it expires. Most members of Congress say that this law, in its current form, is really useless, as can be seen from its application to the Spanish Civil War but not to the Sino-Japanese War in the Far East, which is enough to show its contradictions. In addition, regarding the issue of deciding on a declaration of war by referendum, the motion proposed by Indiana Democratic Congressman Ludlow in December 1937, although rejected by the last Congress, the Ludlow faction believes that at this point, the resistance from the White House and the State Department has been easier to overcome, and they will inevitably bring up the old matter again. As for domestic politics, this Congress will regularly amend certain New Deal laws, and matters related to social labor relief are the most important. Although President Roosevelt will not propose new bills, he may not abandon his original goals, which can be seen from the saying, "As long as he is in office, he will continue to promote reform policies." However, the budget deficit cannot be remedied, and relief for unemployment and expansion of military preparations require funds, so the budget cannot be balanced. It is also worrying that the number of Republican members of Congress has greatly increased, and once they combine with the New Deal opposition in the Democratic Party, they will be able to veto the bills proposed by the government. Fortunately, after a long period of cooperation between the two factions, the Democratic Party itself will be harmed in future elections. Therefore, even if that faction combines with the Republican Party, it may not last long. (Havas, 2nd)

### Democratic Party Factionalism: Pro-New Deal Elements Still Control Congress

(Washington) The 76th Congress opened this afternoon. Since 1932, this is the first time the Democratic Party has faced such a clear factional division. Pro-New Deal Democrats still control both the House and Senate, but conservative Democrats have broken with the President and no longer support his New Deal policies. Therefore, the government may encounter difficulties in passing the President's proposed agenda, which includes the largest national defense expenditure since the European War. The new Congress may oppose the President's management of federal finances and be dissatisfied with defense spending. The President's defense program includes expenditures of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, including the construction of 12,000 aircraft, two 45,000-ton battleships, and the training of air force personnel to strengthen military power. It is now known that Congress may approve the military build-up plan, but any proposal to amend the Neutrality Act will likely cause disputes. (Reuters, 3rd)

### New York Governor Condemns Dictatorship: Emphasizes the Protection of Democracy and Preservation of Religious Freedom

(Albany, New York) New York Governor Lehman (a prominent member of the Democratic Party), after being elected for another term, held an inauguration ceremony tonight and delivered a speech. He condemned all forms of dictatorship, including the dictatorships of the Communist, Fascist, and National Socialist parties. He stated that the United States should reform its social and economic problems to prevent such dictatorships from harming North America. "At this time, the original rational systems are largely replaced by systems of power. Millions of people in other countries have lost their individual freedoms and rights. In order to protect democracy, we should preserve the rights of religious freedom. The most urgent obligation we must fulfill and the responsibility we must bear is to manage public affairs to prevent such tyranny from appearing in our country. If any of the rights enjoyed by American citizens are taken away, then the dictatorship promoted in other countries will surely set foot in our country. I firmly believe that the greatest guarantee of democracy is the recognition of the truths on which religion is based. The true foundation of religion is nothing more than charity, justice, and tolerance. Anyone who attacks religion is weakening our faith, which is unacceptable," he said. (Havas, 2nd)

### U.S. Navy and Air Force to Begin Large-Scale Maneuvers: Over a Hundred Warships and Six Hundred Aircraft Participate to Test the Panama Canal's Defense Capabilities

(Continuation) Today, seven warships left the Brooklyn Naval Yard and headed south, marking the beginning of a large-scale U.S. naval exercise. This exercise, involving 140 warships and 600 aircraft, is intended to make Europe and South America aware of the greatness of American naval power. The "Twenty Problems," as officially called, are scheduled to begin around February 13 and will be the first exercise in the Atlantic in five years. These "problems" will involve a mock battle between attacking and defending fleets. In addition to testing the Panama Canal, some ships will travel south as far as Brazil and Colombia. According to the "New York Times," naval and radio facilities along the U.S. East Coast will be mobilized, and some merchant ships operating in the area may be asked to assist the fleet.

### Britain Plans to Open a North Atlantic Air Route This Summer: Building Four Giant Aircraft That Can Safely Carry Passengers, Expansion to New York Possible if U.S. Agrees to Cooperate

(London) The Royal Air Force announced today that it plans to prepare to establish a formal air route across the North Atlantic from Southampton to Montreal starting in May. Initially, this route will only transport mail, and only after obtaining appropriate safety guarantees will it be able to carry passengers. If the U.S. authorities agree, this route may be extended to New York. Furthermore, the flight from Southampton to Montreal will pass through Foynes and Botwood. According to a Royal Air Force spokesman, Pan American Airways will also establish a route from the Americas to Europe, but he has not yet been informed of this. However, the Royal Air Force has been conducting test flights for several years, and today it is preparing to fly across the Atlantic with four 45,000-pound, four-engine, twenty-four-ton aircraft. The average crossing time is expected to be sixteen hours westbound and thirteen hours returning. Of course, the time will vary depending on the wind direction. The four aircraft prepared to start flying on this new air route are the "Caribou," "Carioca," "Connemara," and "Clyde." These four aircraft were built for the purpose of transporting passengers, but the seats and decorations have not yet been fully prepared, so it is temporarily impossible to start carrying passengers.

### 259 Deaths During the New Year Holiday: Suicide Surge in New York

(New York) During the American New Year holiday, up to yesterday, no less than 259 people died unnaturally. Among them, 150 people died in traffic accidents. A surge in suicides around New York City is also one of the reasons for the high number of violent deaths during the New Year. Five people died in a hotel fire in Rumford, Maine. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Japanese Advance Difficult in Hunan and Jiangxi: Xue Yue Says Chinese Army Should Strive for a Large-Scale Eastern Advance

(Chongqing) Xue Yue, the commander-in-chief of the Chinese army in Hunan Province, expressed doubts about whether the Japanese army would launch a large-scale offensive in the Yangtze River basin at a reception for reporters in Changsha. He said that the Japanese army might concentrate its forces to attack Xi'an in the northwest and Guizhou Province in the southwest. As for the current lull in the Yangtze River front, the reasons are: (1) The Hunan-Jiangxi border has the steep Mufu Mountains as a barrier, and Poyang and Dongting Lakes are distributed in the east and west. In winter and spring, the lake water level is low, making naval operations unsuitable. (2) There is only one railway and one highway between Wuchang and Changsha, and the same is true between Jiujiang and Nanchang. The waters of the Xinqiang River and the Bulo River flow west into Dongting Lake, and the Xiu River and Gan River flow east into Poyang Lake, forming a natural defense line for Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. (3) The continuous mountains and forests of the Mufu Mountains are a strong defense line. If the Japanese army attempts to advance south from Wuchang and Jiujiang, it will be constantly harassed by the Chinese army entrenched in the Mufu Mountains. The Japanese army must transfer another four divisions to advance on Changsha and Nanchang. Therefore, in the future, China should concentrate its military, political, and economic efforts to make a large-scale eastern advance, because a westward movement is only a passive resistance, while an eastern movement can achieve creative results. Only in this way can we implement a long-term war of resistance. (Reuters, 3rd)

Chinese Army Launches Full-Scale General Assault

Zhanggongdu: After the Chinese army launched a full-scale general assault on New Year's Day, all routes have achieved significant gains. The Chinese army is tasked with repairing the north bank of the He River. Currently, the Chinese army still has a considerable number of troops left behind, scattered behind the Japanese lines, engaging in harassment. At the same time, some troops are stationed in the north bank of the river, guarding the pontoon bridges erected to facilitate the activities of Chinese guerrilla units on the north bank. This time, the Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses due to the Chinese army's full-scale assault and is now extremely fearful of Chinese guerrillas. (3rd)

Japanese Army Uses Poison Gas on the North Bank of Zhanggongdu

Zhanggongdu: On the afternoon of the 3rd, the Japanese army, with a force of four companies, about 700 people, under the cover of intense artillery fire, once again launched an offensive against the Chinese army on the north bank of Zhanggongdu, and used gas canisters to release poison gas. More than ten of the loyal and brave Chinese defenders were poisoned, but only slightly. However, they still relied on the terrain and fortifications to firmly defend their positions and fought fiercely with the Japanese army. After a long time, they finally repelled the attacking Japanese army. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties in this battle, and due to the fierce fighting, the Chinese army also suffered considerable sacrifices. (3rd)

Zhanggongdu: On the 29th, the Japanese army at Wangjia Township in the central section of Ruiwu Road gathered more than 200 people, accompanied by 50 cavalrymen, and launched a large-scale westward attack under the cover of four Japanese aircraft, encircling and attacking the guerrilla base of a certain Chinese unit in the Yangcun Baishui area. The loyal and brave Chinese troops relied on dangerous terrain to defend firmly and fought fiercely with the Japanese army for a long time. The Japanese army was unsuccessful, so it wantonly bombed with aircraft and burned more than 300 civilian houses in nearby villages, massacring more than 200 elderly, weak, women, and children.

### German Government Issues New Order: Forcing Young Women to Perform Labor Service, 300,000 to 400,000 People Can Be Recruited Annually, Overcoming the Shortage of Maids and Tenant Farmers

(Berlin) An order has recently been issued that all women under the age of 25 must perform one year of compulsory labor service. Previously, this order only applied to shop clerks or public officials, but now all women must work, either in industry, agriculture, or in households. It is estimated that the implementation of this new order will result in 300,000 to 400,000 young women engaging in this work each year, and the difficulties of a shortage of maids in households and a shortage of tenant farmers in agriculture can be overcome.

### President of Tianjin Chamber of Commerce Assassinated

(Beiping) Wang Zulin, the president of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, who was 83 years old, has always vigorously advocated a closer economic relationship between China and Japan. He was recently assassinated in the French Concession of Tianjin. The Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin has requested the French Concession authorities to thoroughly investigate the incident and to pay closer attention to anti-Japanese elements. The atmosphere in the foreign concessions of Tianjin, which had relaxed from tension only a few days ago, has become tense again due to this incident. (Haitong, 3rd)

### Chinese Army Reports Victory in Huaiyang Area

Luoyang: Amidst the New Year's celebrations, news of a military victory from the Huaiyang area has been received here. A large number of Japanese troops stationed at Anziling in Huaiyang, estimated to be over 2,000 combined infantry and cavalry troops, along with five tanks, were suddenly attacked by a battalion of Li's Regiment of the Chinese army. At the same time, another battalion of the Chinese army, which had been pre-positioned, quickly reinforced the Japanese army's flanks. The Japanese army, relying on its superior strength, immediately engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese army, the fiercest in weeks. Under the Chinese army's flanking attacks from the front, rear, and sides, the Japanese army's momentum gradually weakened. Most of the Chinese army then rushed into Zhangdazhuang and continued to fight the Japanese army for three hours. As a result, the Japanese army was badly defeated and fled towards Huaiyang. In addition to those killed, 400 to 500 people were captured alive. Among the Japanese corpses, one company commander, Xiangyou Qing, and several platoon leaders, including Liushan Xiangzuo, were identified. Three tanks and more than ten vehicles were destroyed. Other spoils of war are still being inventoried. (3rd)

### Western Kang Province Government Established, President Kong's Instructions

Kangding: At the inauguration of the Western Kang Province government, President Kong’s instructions were: The preparations for establishing Western Kang Province have been underway for three years. Today, the provincial government is officially established. This is the realization of a plan that the central government has been aiming at for the past several years. Chairman Liu has overseen the entire process during the preparatory period. The heads of the various departments and members have also worked together in Western Kang, and therefore, this effect has been achieved, which is very commendable. The National Government believes that the former government had short-sighted views, treating the frontier as an outcast and never finding a way to develop it. Western Kang has been part of our territory for more than 2,000 years. Since the Tang Dynasty, the relationship has become even closer, and it has long been integrated with the entire Chinese nation. The economic and cultural aspects are backward, and the resources are no less abundant than those of the inland provinces, but the population is less than one large county in the interior. The local people live in poverty. The government is concerned about our compatriots in Western Kang and deeply understands that the foundation of the war of resistance and national reconstruction must be laid in the west. Therefore, we must devote ourselves to developing the frontier’s politics and economy, and work in tandem to ensure that our frontier compatriots and those living in the interior reach the same level and enjoy the same benefits in both spirit and material. Qinghai, Ningxia, and other places have successively established provinces. After the establishment of provinces, there has been considerable progress in politics, economy, and culture, all of which have facts to prove. Although the establishment of Western Kang Province is somewhat later, the preparatory period has been long, and the central government's subsidies are even greater. When conditions are ripe, it will surely surpass others. The only thing is for the provincial government to be responsible and continue to work hard. The purpose of establishing the province has been described above. To achieve this goal, we must follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions regarding material construction and psychological construction. In Western Kang Province, we must first carefully consider the right priority and catch up. We must never be high-minded and empty-headed and do one-sided work. To develop Western Kang for the purpose of building the province, to improve people's lives, and to consolidate the foundation of national defense, all construction should be aimed at the people and national defense. All those that meet the needs and contribute to national defense are urgent matters. Psychological construction, in the case of Western Kang, is cultural movement. It is undeniable that Western Kang's culture is backward. In the future, special attention should be paid to education, but the situation of education does not have to be the same as that of the interior, but the purpose of education must be the same as that of the interior. In the past, the failure of border affairs had many reasons, but cultural despotism, which did not allow people on the border to receive education, was one of the biggest reasons. There are several stories in history that reflect the misunderstanding of the frontier at that time, such as prohibiting the import of scriptures into foreign countries, and even denying the scriptures to vassal states, which was really shallow and ridiculous. In the future, the development of Western Kang's cultural undertakings can determine the government's mission, which I hope to discuss with you all. As for religious customs, they vary from place to place, and religious beliefs are clearly stated in the law. Buddhism has always been flourishing in Western Kang, so we should make use of the situation to respect the traditional customs so that they do not harm the unity of the country. We must never impose on others what we do not want, and cause misunderstandings due to disagreements. In short, at the beginning of Western Kang's establishment as a province, the social atmosphere and folk customs are simple and unadorned, just like a blank sheet of paper. Whatever is written is appropriate, and it only depends on whether the writer is good at writing or not. All of you have profound knowledge and experience, and I firmly believe that you will be able to follow the central government's intentions, develop from the bottom up, and benefit the country. The brand new situation has just begun to be promoted today. There are high expectations. (2nd)

### Shaanxi Border Defense Line Solidly Deployed

Xingji: It is reported that the Japanese army, a regiment that invaded Niangniang Temple to the north, after capturing Xiangning, invaded Jixian City at 7:00 a.m. on the 31st. By the afternoon, the Japanese army advanced west in three routes. One route, with more than 400 people, passed through Lancun, seemingly heading towards Longwang Temple. Another route advanced through Gaolou Village towards Xiaochuanwo. The third route took the road through Guantoushan towards Guxian Village. They have already made contact with a certain Chinese division. The Hexi defense line is now firmly deployed. If the Japanese army crosses the river to harass Shaanxi, it will suffer a major blow. (2nd)

(Xi'an) Military news: The Japanese army, about a regiment, invading north of Xiangning, captured Jixian on the 31st. In the afternoon, part of the Japanese army advanced west, appearing to be attacking the Yellow River. On the morning of the 1st, there was fierce fighting in the Guantoushan area (20 miles northwest of Jixian). According to reports, this route of the Japanese army was intercepted by a certain Chinese unit, killing and wounding dozens of people. In the afternoon of the 1st, they fled back to Jixian. So far, the Japanese army in Guxian has only occupied various hilltops near the county seat. There is no trace of the Japanese army more than ten miles away. Chinese units have been divided into two groups, one on the north mountain and one on the south mountain, to encircle the Japanese army. The river defense units are also fully equipped. (3rd)

### The Process of the Red Army Led by Xiang Ying Participating in the War of Resistance Against Japan: Warriors from Eight Provinces Responded from Afar, Concentrated, and Engaged in Battle for Six Months, Japanese Army Suffered Over 2,000 Casualties

Belden, special correspondent of the English-language Da Mei Evening News, correspondence from the headquarters of the New Fourth Route Army south of Wuhu: Along the Yangtze River, from Nanjing in the east to Anqing in the west, and reaching the mountains, lakes, and rivers in the north and south, the New Fourth Route Army operates within it. At dusk and dawn, they raid Japanese garrisons, snipe transport ships, overturn trucks, capture Japanese prisoners and return to headquarters, and explode Japanese storage areas, demolish bridges, and destroy highways. Day after day, they harass Japanese sentries, and occasionally attack assembled regular Japanese troops. The New Fourth Route Army has 20,000 people, divided into four detachments, two-thirds of whom are former Red Army soldiers. However, they did not participate in the "Long March," because they were left behind to continue fighting the Central Army. In 1934, when Zhu De and Mao Zedong led the main force of the Red Army on the Long March, they left behind a considerable number of Red Army troops led by Xiang Ying to contain the attacks of the Central Army. They then dispersed to various places. Xiang Ying is now the deputy commander of the New Fourth Route Army. According to him, for the past three years, most of the Red Army troops have been sleeping on the mountains, sleeping on the ground, often traveling more than a hundred miles every night, carrying three days' worth of food. Without the people, the Red Army would never be able to exist. When in trouble, they rely on the farmers and villagers for food and leadership to break through the encirclement. After the Lugou Bridge Incident, the remnants of the Red Army in South China appealed to the government to be transferred to the front lines to resist Japan, and the government agreed. In September, Xiang Ying went to Nanchang to meet with He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Affairs, on behalf of the government. In October, the Military Commission agreed to incorporate the former Red Army into the National Army. Ye Ting, who had retired to Hong Kong for many years due to his active military life, was appointed as commander and named the New Fourth Route Army. It was not until December that they received orders to go to the front lines and gather the former Red Army troops scattered in various places. In the towns and villages, messengers spread the word that the central government and the Red Army would no longer fight each other, and that they would only fight Japan from now on. The Red Army's radio station also used this news to inform middle-ranking commanding officers without radio stations, and used government trucks to go to the provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Hunan to spread Xiang Ying's summons. They then traveled from these eight provinces to the front lines to fight the Japanese army. They walked at least eight hundred miles to the meeting place, and some walked more than two thousand miles. By April, most of the army had assembled, with 40% occupying the north bank of the Yangtze River and 60% occupying the south bank. Government personnel came to register the number of people and issue weapons. Since the New Fourth Route Army first fought the Japanese army in Shucheng in early May, they have been fighting every day without interruption. According to their own records, the New Fourth Route Army fought for six months, and the Japanese army suffered more than 2,500 casualties, and 500 rifles were seized. (To be continued)

### Guerrilla Activities Increasingly Active in Suzhou and Jiaxing: Japanese Army Often Harassed by Guerrillas, Chinese Do Not Trust Japanese Military Scrip

The Continental Daily reports that a certain merchant who recently traveled to the guerrilla areas of Jiaxing and Suzhou for business has returned to Shanghai. Yesterday (2nd), he told reporters that guerrilla activities have recently become increasingly active. The Japanese army claims to have obtained the peace and order it sought, but it has not achieved it. In the small villages within 50 miles of Jiaxing on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, there are active guerrilla forces. Anyone entering and leaving Jiaxing City who does not wear a "good citizen badge" is suspected of being a guerrilla. Anyone who angers the Japanese guards will be abused by them. The Japanese army explains its abuse of the people by pointing out that the person "is a Communist." Since the fall of Suzhou, only a small number of Japanese troops have been stationed there, and they have recently been harassed by guerrillas. The Japanese army has no peace, so it has tightened its defenses and increased its troops. In the past, there were no military defenses in and around Suzhou City, but in the past few weeks, pillboxes and machine-gun nests have been built at the city gates. Every morning, the sound of Japanese gunfire can be heard outside the city. The Japanese army says it is practicing, but we know it is fighting with the Chinese. The trains to Suzhou and Jiaxing run fairly on time. It is impossible to reserve or pre-purchase train tickets, so the stations are often crowded with people waiting for the ticket windows to open. When the Japanese check the passengers' passes on the train, they charge a "small fee" for each item carried: one dime for a basket of fruit, and two dimes for a bundle of clothes. Although there are no large-scale rapes or robberies now, at night, Japanese soldiers still go to people's homes to rob valuables and harass women. Most of the food needed by the Japanese army is supplied by the Chinese. The Japanese army appoints a Chinese person as an intermediary to buy food from farmers. Therefore, farmers and merchants can still buy and sell, but what they receive is Japanese military scrip. At the current exchange rate, farmers receive one yuan of Japanese military scrip for one yuan of legal tender, but in the past, military scrip was worth more, with one yuan of Japanese currency worth one yuan and two dimes of legal tender. The Chinese have no trust in Japanese military scrip because the Japanese army is issuing it indiscriminately. They are also unwilling to accept Japanese banknotes. Farmers often survive by making goods at home. They can still do this now, so trade with Japanese merchants in the countryside has failed. Farmers try to exchange their Japanese currency for legal tender, while merchants need Japanese currency because they can only use Japanese currency. Once the farmers get legal tender, they save it. The Japanese army's efforts to prevent guerrillas from entering towns and villages have also failed. A few days ago, a certain well-dressed Chinese man arrived at the Jiaxing military headquarters in a rickshaw. The servant went out to greet him. This man presented two cartons of Pai Men cigarettes, a very popular brand in Jiaxing, and a note stating that they were for the commanding officer of the headquarters. The Japanese commanding officer was delighted to see them. He opened the first carton and found the cigarettes to be very good. However, when he opened the second carton, a bomb exploded inside, injuring the officer and many others. By the time the Japanese army went out to capture the cigarette deliverer, he had already fled far away. Although this person escaped, other Chinese were badly treated by the Japanese that night, who searched people's homes and arrested and punished men. The guerrillas behind the Japanese lines are obviously very well organized. In addition to sniping at the Japanese army, they also have spies operating in the towns and villages.

### Kunshan Puppet Organization's Decline in Tax Collection; Many Property Owners Disobey

Kunshan Correspondence: The puppet county government established a puppet tax collection committee in mid-November of last year. In addition to the directors of urban and rural areas serving as de facto puppet committee members, several landlords from each township were also included. The puppet tax offices in urban and rural areas were also established one after another, each with one puppet director, two deputy directors, three accountants, six collectors, and three clerks. With so many redundant personnel, the expenses were enormous, requiring 502 yuan per office per month. Most of these tax collectors were former yamen runners, excelling at exploiting the villagers, which caused immense suffering among the farmers. Fifty percent of the collected taxes were allocated to the accountants of the property owners, who would issue receipts and keep them in custody. Sixteen percent was designated as "rural relief funds," allocated to the township management committees or township directors for safekeeping and management. The remaining thirty-four percent was handed over to the puppet county government in full. In late December, the puppet county government also

issued fourteen strict articles outlining the procedures for tax collection, reflecting a clear lack of trust in the personnel responsible for the collection. Although these regulations were in place, they failed to gain the trust of most property owners. Initially, the deadline for property owners to submit registers of tenant names to the county was November 15th, but few complied. The deadline was extended to the end of December, but in reality, only over 60,000 households submitted registers, less than a quarter of the total number of property owners in the county. Recently, the puppet county government sent letters to the neighboring puppet county governments of Jiading, Taicang, Qingpu, Wuxian, and Changshu, requesting them to notify all property owners under their jurisdiction with farmland in Kunshan to promptly submit registers of their managed land and taxes. Simultaneously, notices were posted in urban and rural areas, informing property owners to submit tax registers to the county and not to collect rent privately, but these efforts yielded no results.

The decline in tax collection by the puppet organization in Kunshan can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, large parts of the countryside are under the control of guerrilla forces, making it impossible for puppet tax collectors to penetrate. Secondly, most of the tax collectors are idle elements from urban and rural areas with addictions, and property owners are unwilling to entrust them with the hard-earned rent. Thirdly, most property owners in the countryside are well aware of the nature of the tenants and often collect rent themselves, without the need for such cumbersome procedures. Due to these factors, the puppet organization faces numerous difficulties in collecting taxes, and even with all-out efforts, it is difficult to achieve results.

### Jiaxing, Haiyan, and Chinese Army Eliminate Puppet Guerrillas; Ten Bandits Use False Pretexts, Committing All Kinds of Evil Everywhere

Jiaxing Correspondence: After the ×× Division of the Chinese Army crossed the river to Haiyan, they advanced towards the towns of Shendang, Yucheng in Haiyan, and Xinhuang, Fengjie Bridge, and Shifosi in Jiaxing. The Japanese troops entrenched in Xinfeng were completely eliminated. As a result, the Pingjia Highway in Pinghu was completely demolished and leveled, and all ports, large and small, were sealed off with wooden fences, cutting off all transportation. However, in the surrounding countryside, bandit-style guerrillas, falsely claiming to be fighting the enemy, were rampant, extorting money from villages, carrying firearms, and robbing and torturing people in gangs, causing unbearable suffering. They openly kidnapped people, and the public, fearing their retaliation, endured the violence in silence. A widow in her thirties, who once ran the Lu Songsheng South Goods Store in Fengjie Bridge, was living with the owner of the Jinglun Silk and Cloth Store in a certain village near Fengjie Bridge. A Shaoxing guerrilla leader led his team and broke into the house, mistakenly believing her to be the Jinglun owner's primary wife. They brutally interrogated her, stripped her naked, and burned her lower body with fire, then extinguished it with water, repeating the process until the widow died a tragic death. After the widow's death, her three children were displaced. Similar cases are numerous. After learning of this situation, the cadres of the ×× Division held a joint military-civilian celebration in Fengjie Bridge. The director of the Political Training Department, Kuang, announced the decision to eliminate the bandits falsely claiming to be guerrillas to alleviate the suffering of the people. After the meeting, the guerrilla leader who tortured the Lu Songsheng widow was arrested in a certain village, and five rifles and two short guns were confiscated from his home, along with countless stolen goods. He was paraded through the streets and then executed by shooting in Qingshui Bay, and his heart was dug out as an offering to the deceased widow, greatly pleasing the people. At the same time, two thieves (actually bandit-style guerrillas) were arrested and executed by shooting in Shifosi and Yuxian Dai respectively. Since then, the bandit atmosphere in the surrounding areas has gradually subsided, and land and water transportation has returned to normal. The division also jointly requested the Provincial Government Action Committee with the People's National Salvation Army led by Jiang Shuwei to appoint captains of the major brigades, assign their stationed areas, organize anti-traitor groups to eliminate traitors, and expand the intelligence network to facilitate the recovery of lost territories.

### Electric Accounting Method and Electric Computers

Introduction

The ancient method of calculation was knot-tying for record-keeping. Later, Rome invented the abacus, thus having a tangible method of calculation. This was the first step in the success of the calculation world. Most Eastern countries still use it today. By the end of the seventeenth century, Pascal's calculator was produced, using mechanical force for numerical calculation and organization, with efficiency more agile than the abacus, and could avoid errors and save brainpower. This was the second step in the success of the calculation world. The application of this type of computer is very useful for small-scale surveys and statistics. Even today, banks, businesses, and department stores in our country still commonly use it. However, for larger-scale surveys and statistics, the time constraints and heavy workload are still insufficient. The beginning of the nineteenth century was also the beginning of the third successful step in the calculation world. The success of this step has brought about unprecedented development in the entire calculation problem, which is worthy of praise. Tangible methods of calculation still require the use of quick wit to be successful. This reform does not focus on the tangible, but automates the entire procedure through machine calculation. This is the basis of the electric accounting method invented by statistical expert Dr. Harold Hollerith. This principle has been repeatedly reformed. Among the best are Mr. White and Mr. Hollerith. After decades of improvement, its effectiveness and scope of application have increased day by day. A large amount of data can be obtained with the most accurate results in a very short time. Therefore, this machine, which was once regarded as a rare treasure by a few statisticians, has now become a powerful tool for various industrial, commercial, administrative, and educational institutions to develop their business and strictly manage and prepare various detailed reports.

1.  Principles and Application of Electric Accounting Methods

The principle of the electric accounting method is to use various data and punch holes in specially made cards using the punching method. The machine then works by contacting the holes punched on the cards, causing the current to be interrupted. It is like a blind person reading a book, using raised letters to distinguish. However, when you see the electric motor working, the motor is turned on, and each machine automatically starts working. Various data items in the card box, like snowflakes flying, are calculated and organized in an instant. The speed and accuracy of its work are amazing, and it is believed that this complex machine is based on the above simple principles.

The application of electric accounting methods usually goes through the following steps:

A. Numbering: Classify various data and compile numbers. Even words such as people's names and place names are represented by numbers. For example, in customs import and export trade statistics, the names of various goods and place names are printed in special books, all for the purpose of organizing this survey and statistics. The job of numbering is to compile each data item into a special number to represent it. After the numbers are compiled, punch holes on the cards according to the numbers. These cards are specially and precisely made. Their thickness and weight must be uniform in order to be compatible with the internal structure of the machine.

B. Registration: After compiling all the data into numbers, punch the numbers onto the cards. The placement of these numbers has a certain arrangement. Each row represents an item. The electric computer uses up to eighty horizontal rows on the card, and each row has twelve punching positions, counted from 0 to 12. When completely filled, 960 holes can be punched. Therefore, this card is sufficient to represent any complex material. The latest method is that those who are not suitable for representation by numbers can also use English multi-purpose punching machines to punch the data into English letters and numbers. Whether the numbers are compiled or not, the generated report can be printed out in both text and numbers.

C. Proofreading: After punching, it is necessary to proofread whether the cards are accurate. The punch operator puts the cards into the proofreading machine and punches the original data again. Every time a key is pressed, if it matches the previously punched hole, the machine will push the card forward one row. If the card does not move forward, it indicates that there is an error in the original card, and it must be re-punched.

D. Classification: After the punching is completed, the order of the cards is usually extremely chaotic. Therefore, a counting and sorting machine must be used to arrange them in the order of a certain piece of data to be based on. Its rate is to sort 400 cards per minute.

E. Tabulation: The ultimate goal of the electric accounting method is to automatically compile and print the data into a report. This step must use a calculating and printing machine, because this machine is a complex addition and subtraction classification and printing machine. Place the punched cards into the machine, which can make the adder and printer work one after another. This machine can also adapt to any changes in the report format. The machine is fully automatic, printing the report while automatically punching the total number onto another card. Its functions are unparalleled.

2.  Benefits of Electric Accounting Methods

There are many benefits of electric accounting methods. They can be roughly summarized into four points: speed, accuracy, adaptability, and simplicity.

Speed: The ordinary registration methods are nothing more than hand registration and typing. Hand registration methods have been abolished for various modern registration items. As for the most agile typist, they can only type 240 letters per minute. If electric accounting method punching registration is applied, roughly 500 holes can be punched per minute. From this perspective, registering with an electric computer is 50% faster than a typewriter. Moreover, the machine can automatically copy cards, and the more copies, the greater this percentage. The amazing speed of electric accounting method classification work is unmatched in the world. This has been recognized as a fact by mankind. According to the results of actual verification, the efficiency of electric computers in addition is about 1 to 72 compared with adding machines. As for the product, electric motors are more than twice as fast as multiple machines. The most moving aspect of electric accounting methods is that most of the work is automated. Therefore, after punching the cards, employees can make the translator, sorter, and computer work one by one. When the machine is working automatically, employees can take on other jobs.

Accuracy: The second benefit of electric accounting methods is accuracy, and 100% accuracy. After punching the cards, they are checked and proven to be error-free. Then the calculations and reports made based on the cards will also be error-free. Using this constant card as a medium for registration, selection, classification, calculation, etc., its accuracy is self-evident. The common weakness of other calculation methods is that it takes a lot of money and time to balance the debit and credit sides. To avoid this common error of artificial methods, one must rely on electric accounting methods.

Adaptability: The electric accounting method is very adaptable. If the punched card is not full and you want to add data, it only takes very little time and the cheapest price to add several more groups on the card. The area of the card is very small and it is very easy to store, and it may become very valuable data in the future. Special analysis comparison reports and various government-requested information can be found on the punched cards. A set of machines can handle multiple tasks, so the punching registration method can concentrate all work in one place, and if the using organization wants to modify the system or change the method, it only needs to modify the form of the card, or re-insert the electrical plug board on the tabulation machine, and it will be done. The supervisors of various businesses often like to get the grand total first due to special needs, and then close it once so that the management office can use this to create a financial report. Accounting and statistical personnel often feel that this procedure is repetitive. If electric accounting methods are used, it is not limited by the order, and can provide reports in any order.

Simplicity: The manpower used in electric accounting methods is only in punching and proofreading punching. The simplicity of the punching procedure can be learned by anyone. These punch operators do not necessarily need to have any experience in business to learn how to punch any type of card. Because this type of card has been recognized as the medium for using automatic machines. In addition to the punching work, the subsequent tabulation procedures are all automatic by the machine.

3.  Introduction to Electric Computers

Ten years ago, the entire equipment of electric computers only included three machines: a punch machine, a sorter, and a computer. The work that these three basic machines could handle was not complete. The various tasks before and after the calculation work often had to be done manually. Now, the most complete and efficient electric motors are produced by International Machines Corporation. Here are some of the most important ones:

(1) Punch Machine and Electric Punch Machine

As the name suggests, this machine is dedicated to punching holes. The latter has better functions. The average rate is five holes per second.

(2) Proofreading Machine: Dedicated to proofreading. Place the punched card on this machine and punch it again. If there is an error in the original punched card, the machine will not move forward when the button is pressed. Proofreading is simple and agile. There is also a mechanical proofreading machine and an electric proofreading machine.

(3) Automatic Translator: Translates each of the 45 lines or a part of the data that has been punched on the card and prints it on the card, making verification, filing, selection, and reference easier and faster.

(4) Automatic Group Punch Machine: Sometimes, many cards must be punched with the same holes, either all or partially. The function of the group punch machine is to rush to complete this type of work.

(5) English Punch Machine: This machine can punch English letters and numbers on the card, and then the English calculating and printing machine can print them into English names, words, and numbers.

(6) Electric Sorter: This machine can automatically divide all cards into categories, and at the same time arrange each category of cards in any order, and can select all cards of a certain category without disturbing the original order of other categories of cards. After this machine is equipped with a card selector, it can select a certain special number from a stack of cards without disturbing the original order of the cards.

(7) Automatic Counting Machine: This machine can automatically multiply the number groups punched on the table example card, and at the same time subtract when multiplying, and automatically punch the product, sum, and difference in the designated place on this card.

(8) Calculating Printing Machine and Automatic Summarizing Machine: The calculating printing machine is a complex adding and subtracting sorting and printing machine, which can automatically print a complete report according to the table example card. Its rate is 150 cards per minute, and it can print out the number of items, sub-items, totals, and differences. If this machine is equipped with an automatic summarizing machine, it will punch another card with the summary number or difference at the same time when calculating and printing, increasing the printing efficiency and saving punching time.

English Calculating Printing Machine: This machine can use completed punched cards to print English letters on the report. In addition to the working efficiency of the calculating printing machine, it also gets the assistance of English letters.

(9) Card Position Selector: Position selection occupies an important position in all printing machines. Therefore, this device can increase the adaptability of the electric computer. When printing the holes punched on the table example card into a report, this device can automatically classify different data in a group and print them separately on the report. Conversely, this device can also select the same data punched in each group on the card from each group and print it into a total number on the report. Therefore, this device can freely add certain data in the same group to the report, and can also freely delete certain data in the same group from the report.

(10) Calculating Sorter: Sometimes work is urgent, and it is necessary to find a way to perform the two tasks of calculation and sorting at the same time. This machine is sufficient to complete this purpose. If only one task is done, it is also possible.

(11) Automatic Re-Punch Machine: This machine can re-punch all or partial numbers or English letter data on cards with the same re-punched or group-punched data. It can be re-punched or group-punched in any order or at the same time.

(12) Electric Copying Punch Machine: In addition to the function of the electric punch machine, this machine can also be used to re-punch the entire card or a certain group of records that are the same on several cards. The fingers still need to move when punching the original card, but the subsequent action of copying the second card is completely automatic by the machine.

(13) Automatic Check Translator: This machine has three functions: A. Check filling machine B. Check protector C. Table example card translator These three functions can be used interchangeably at any time.

(14) International Re-Punch Machine: This machine has a dual function, which can be used to re-punch or group-punch cards. If you want to copy part or all of any group of cards, you can use this machine. The data of each card can be changed to another position and group-punched on the detailed number card, and re-punching and group-punching can work at the same time. When re-punching a group of cards according to the original card, the groups that should be punched can be group-punched immediately.

Looking at the above machines, we can see the hard work of European and American countries in the research of electric accounting methods. The degree of precision and prudence is truly admirable. In addition to applying it, should we not feel ashamed, eliminate the dross and preserve the essence, and promote and expand it? Is this not the responsibility of the citizens of the new China?

### Municipal Organization of the French Concession

— Shugan

After the French Concession was established on March 14th of the Daoguang 29th year of the Qing Dynasty (April 6, 1849), it took eight years, and the police station was officially established on February 7th of the Xianfeng 7th year of the Qing Dynasty (December 22, 1857). As for the municipal agency, the Board of Directors, it was not established until April 3rd of the Tongzhi 1st year of the Qing Dynasty (May 1, 1863).

The board of directors of the Board of Directors was initially appointed by the French Consul-General in Shanghai, but later changed to an election system. After the 16th year of the Republic of China, it was changed to an appointment system again. From then on, the elected board of directors of the French Concession was interrupted and replaced by appointments, which changed annually.

The board of directors of the Board of Directors is divided into nine committees: Engineering, Finance, Education, Doctor Relief, Transportation Horticulture, Real Estate, Rectification Room Donation, and Hospital Management. Although the organization is numerous, it is only an agency representing public opinion, and more realistically speaking, it is only an advisory agency to the French Consul-General. All administrative and police powers within the concession, as well as the appointment and removal of public officials, belong to the French Consul-General.

As for the internal organization of the Board of Directors, it was initially divided into: Municipal General Affairs Office, Public Works Office, Police Office, and Medical Office. On December 21st of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), the board of directors of the French Board of Directors believed that the municipal affairs within the concession were becoming increasingly complex. In order to make the sequence of each agency and the work of each level have excellent efficiency, it was decided to reorganize the agencies within the Bureau, and the organization was more secretive and complex than before; later, there were considerable reforms. The organization of this year is listed below:

### Still Lingering in Hong Kong Yesterday - Wang Jingwei Did Not Come to Shanghai - Various Rumors Arriving in Shanghai Found to be Untrue - Chu Minyi Left His Residence, His Whereabouts Unknown

Since Wang Jingwei violated party and national discipline and was expelled from the party and removed from his post by the Central Committee, there have been many rumors about his whereabouts in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other places in recent days. The night before last and yesterday, there were rumors in this city that he had already arrived in Shanghai, and some said that he had gone to Hongkou. After inquiries by our reporters, it was found that the rumors of Wang's arrival in Shanghai were mostly unreliable. The details are recorded as follows:

No Trace of Wang on the Italian Ship

Rumors of his arrival in Shanghai began circulating in this city the night before last, claiming that he had taken the Italian ship "Conte Rosso" from Hong Kong to Shanghai and disembarked at the Osaka Wharf in Hongkou the day before yesterday. However, after investigation by reporters, it was found that the "Conte Rosso" arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 AM on the 31st of last month. The claim that the ship arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd is likely a mistake. The ship is currently scheduled to set sail from Shanghai at 6:00 AM today to return to Europe. The shipping company also denied that Wang took the ship to Shanghai.

Chu Minyi Out Yesterday, Not Returned

Yesterday, it was suddenly rumored in this city that Wang had already arrived in Shanghai, because Hongkou had announced a special curfew on the evening of the 2nd, with Japanese marines densely stationed and traffic cut off. The rumor-mongers believed that the curfew was different from usual and therefore believed it was evidence of Wang's arrival in Shanghai. There were also rumors that Wang was staying in the Broadway Mansions. However, after investigation, these rumors were also found to be untrue. Last night, reporters also visited Chu Minyi, who has been staying in Shanghai for a long time, but were unable to meet him. According to sources, Chu was still in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, his gatekeeper told reporters that Chu had gone out yesterday morning and had not returned to his residence when the reporter visited. The claim that Chu has gone elsewhere is still difficult to verify.

Wang's Arrival in Shanghai is Absolutely Not True

Furthermore, according to reliable sources, after various evening newspapers in this city published confusing news about Wang Jingwei secretly arriving in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, it aroused deep attention from all circles in this city. In order to verify the truth, our reporters traveled around to inquire from various sources. Until late at night, it was confirmed by reliable sources that Wang is still staying in Hong Kong as of yesterday. The claim that he had taken the Italian ship and arrived in Shanghai is absolutely not true.

Fast News Agency Reports Wang's Arrival in Shanghai

According to the Shanghai dispatch of the Fast News Agency, it is widely rumored among well-informed sources here that Wang Jingwei, who recently betrayed the country by surrendering to Japan, arrived in Shanghai late last night and disembarked at the Hongkou Wharf. After various inquiries by reporters from the Fast News Agency, it is learned that Chu Minyi, who has close relations with Wang and has been staying in Shanghai for a long time, suddenly left his residence at 408 Avenue Albert late yesterday. It is certain that Chu was still at his residence at 408 Avenue Albert the night before last (the 2nd). He did not spend the night there that night, and he was not seen returning to his residence yesterday. His family members said that they did not know where he had gone. Many believe that Chu may not have left Shanghai to go to Hong Kong, but is likely related to going to Hongkou to meet Wang. Therefore, the claim that Wang has secretly arrived in Shanghai and has arrived in Hongkou is very possible. In addition, Hongkou implemented a special curfew from 11:00 PM the night before last, which is why there are rumors of Wang's arrival in Shanghai.

### Although Customs Revenue is Temporarily Stopped from Being Transferred, Finances Are Not Affected - The Ministry of Finance Has Already Taken Remedial Measures - The Japanese Side is Not Allowed to Withdraw or Transfer the Stored Tax Funds

According to the Shanghai Chinese financial community, although Shanghai Jianghai Customs revenue has been forced to deposit in the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank since July last year and stopped from being transferred to the National Government, resulting in a decrease in government tax revenue, this has not affected China's finances. For example, foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties are still being repaid as before. This is because the authorities of the Ministry of Finance have already taken countermeasures, establishing new tax collection offices in the inland and coastal areas. All goods transported from areas occupied by the Japanese army must pay national taxes again in order to make up for this loss. According to news released by the Jianghai Customs authorities, the depositing of these tax funds in the Yokohama Specie Bank cannot be regarded as having been seized, because the tax funds deposited in the Japanese bank are all in the name of Sir Frederick Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, and cannot be used without Sir Maze's consent. Maze is under the command of the Ministry of Finance, and this measure also has international implications. The Anglo-Japanese Customs Temporary Agreement also stipulates that the funds cannot be withdrawn or transferred.

### American Flour Shipped to Shanghai - Totaling 24,000 Bags - Result of the American "One Bowl of Rice" Movement

According to the Shanghai dispatch of the Fast News Agency, the American people, in sympathy with China's resistance against Japan and in view of the prolonged war, the expansion of the war zone, and the increase in innocent disaster victims, launched a "One Bowl of Rice" movement to raise funds to purchase American wheat to ship to China for relief. Now, another 24,000 bags of American wheat for refugee relief have been entrusted to the American Red Cross to be shipped to China on the "Saukra" ship. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai the day after tomorrow. Of the 24,000 bags of American wheat, 8,000 bags will be distributed to South China and will be unloaded en route via Hong Kong. The remaining 16,000 bags will be distributed by the International Relief Committee in Shanghai.

### After the Ministry of Finance Reorganized Transit Tax, Last Year's Increase Exceeded 50 Million - Although in the Midst of Fierce Sino-Japanese War, Still More Than Doubled Compared to the Previous Year

After the Ministry of Finance reorganized transit tax, tax revenue increased significantly. Although the 27th year was in the midst of a fierce Sino-Japanese war and trade between China and foreign countries declined, transit tax was still better than the previous year. According to statistics from the Directorate General of Customs, the total transit tax of all ports nationwide in the whole year was 55,400,000 yuan, exceeding the 20,150,000 yuan of the previous year by 35,690,000 yuan, a sharp increase of more than double.

### All Government Agencies and Organizations Will Resume Work as Usual Starting Today - Silver Shops Will Open Tomorrow

All government agencies and organizations in this city, such as the Jianghai Customs and the Post Office, have followed the usual practice of taking a three-day holiday to celebrate New Year's Day. Now that the holiday is over, it has been decided to resume work as usual starting today. All members of the Shanghai Silver and Money Trades Association, including banks and money shops, were able to obtain a surplus in the final accounts of this session. After the final settlement for the 27th year, they all took a four-day holiday starting on the 1st. However, in order to sort out various businesses over the past year and handle the final accounts, internal office work is still as usual. Therefore, internal settlements in various banks have still been busy in recent days. All are allowed to open for business on the 5th. Most banks were able to obtain a surplus in the final accounts.

### Labor Dispute at the Hong Kong Chung Hwa Book Company Resolved - Shanghai Colleagues Received Telegram Reporting

The Hong Kong headquarters of the Chung Hwa Book Company previously dismissed employees, which led to a labor dispute and a strike. All employees telegraphed the Central Government, requesting assistance, and telegraphed the Shanghai Chung Hwa Book Company Employees' Association, reporting the progress of the dispute and requesting a telegram to the Hong Kong headquarters requesting that work be resumed immediately. It is learned that the Shanghai Association received a report yesterday stating that the labor dispute in Hong Kong had been resolved and the factory had announced the resumption of work. The wages during the strike period will still be paid as usual. It is said that the Shanghai Association intends to make a detailed report on the resolution of the labor dispute and distribute it to colleagues in Haiphong, Kunming, and Shanghai.

### Loan Syndicates Press for Repayment from Fishermen Who Joined the Puppet Fishing Market - This Kind of Action is Despicable - The Loan Syndicate Will Not Grant Leniency

According to a special dispatch from Hong Kong, banking circles revealed that in order to develop the coastal fishing industry, the Ministry of Industry previously established a loan syndicate with banking circles in Shanghai and lent out huge amounts of loans, stipulating repayment on schedule. Subsequently, due to the outbreak of the war, the loans could not be repaid on schedule. The syndicate, understanding the difficulties of the merchants, granted leniency. It is now learned that a small number of fishing merchants have actually raised funds to join the puppet "Fishing Market" and purchase shares in the so-called "Central China Fisheries Company." This kind of action is despicable. The syndicate will not grant them leniency, and legitimate fishermen will also ask the government to provide assistance.

### Hata Shunroku Returned to Japan to Relinquish His Position - Successor Not Yet Announced - Rumored to be Selected from Young Military Officers

According to the Mainland News, it was learned last night (the 2nd) that Hata Shunroku, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in Central China, has recently returned to Japan and will soon meet with the Japanese Emperor to relinquish his position as Commander-in-Chief. Hata's successor has not yet been announced, but according to Japanese sources, the new Commander-in-Chief will be selected from young generals who are not well known to outsiders. Hata has meritorious service in the Japanese Army. In 1901, he first served as an artillery officer. In 1931, he was promoted to Lieutenant General. In November 1937, he was promoted to General and commanded the Japanese army in the Shanghai area.

### Curfew Suddenly Imposed on Waibaidu Bridge Last Night

From 11:00 PM last night, the Japanese side suddenly imposed a curfew at the Waibaidu Bridge, prohibiting all vehicles from passing through and only allowing pedestrians to pass. It will be open until 5:00 AM at dawn. The reason for this will be investigated and reported later.

### Alumni of Zhejiang Advanced School Held New Year's Dinner - Recalling Old Stories from 30 Years Ago - The Situation at the Time of Establishing the School

Alumni of the Zhejiang Advanced School in Shanghai held a dinner yesterday. Old teachers and students who attended included Chen Shenshu, Sun Qincai, Xiang Lansun, Qian Jiaqia, Shou Baigeng, Jun Peizi, Tu Kaitai, Xu Jiyin, Tang Shunian, Xiong Lingxiao, Xu Xingbin, Zhou Chichen, Liu Fuzhong, He Baixiang, Pan Gengsheng, Chuan Zhuangmin, Xu Yongzuo, Feng Liutang, Meng Wangqu, Zhu Hongru, Lu Zongfu, Yin Heng, Sheng Shuhang, Ruan Kai, Ma Gongping, and more than thirty other people. During the dinner, everyone talked about the school life of 30 years ago. Mr. Chen Zhongshu was a pioneer in Zhejiang's education. His description of the education establishment during the late Qing Dynasty was not as detailed in official documents. At that time, they didn't know how to run the school, so they visited the Shanghai St. John's University and the Hangzhou Yu Ying College to learn. However, even a small blackboard could not be used with chalk because the black paint was faded. He also wrote a "Criminal Braid Essay" for students, which was denounced by Manchu and Mongolian students, almost causing a literary inquisition. Fortunately, Ren Daorong, the Zhejiang Governor at the time, understood the big picture and nothing happened. And above the school supervisors was the Director-General, and the supervisors also had one official and one gentry member. All of these showed the poor state of education when China first established schools. The listeners sometimes laughed and sometimes sighed, but they never tired of listening. It is said that the teachers and students of the school are still writing memoirs to show a glimpse of the school at that time. The so-called Zhejiang University, Zhejiang Advanced School, and Zhejiang Higher School after the Republic of China are all purely recreational in nature. During the dinner, they only talked about old stories and reminisced about the past, so they felt even closer.

### 30,000 White Russians Will Celebrate the New Year - Lunar New Year's Eve is on the 13th - White Russians Will Celebrate

According to the Mainland News, Shanghai has mostly passed the New Year, but the 30,000 White Russian immigrants in this city are only about to complete their preparations for celebrating Christmas and the New Year. Although White Russians who have wandered abroad have officially adopted the Gregorian calendar, they have not abandoned their old lunar calendar in terms of holidays. According to this calendar, Friday evening is Christmas Eve, and Friday evening, January 13th, is Lunar New Year's Eve. After the Soviet government came to power in Russia, it abolished the old calendar and adopted the Gregorian calendar, so the people of the Soviet Union also celebrate New Year's Day on the same day as other European countries. However, White Russian immigrants still follow the old calendar. At that time, White Russians in this city will celebrate, and White Russian churches will also light traditional candles and hold special religious ceremonies.

### Restrictions on the Import of Foreign Goods Have Been Effective - Imports of Luxury Goods Have Been Sharply Reduced - The Overall Import Surplus Has Been Reduced as a Result - Foreign Exchange is Still Supplied for the Import of Necessities

The Chinese government, in view of the fact that since the Anti-Japanese War, the number of imports of luxury goods and non-essential goods has still been huge, which has greatly affected foreign exchange reserves, had to impose restrictions. Therefore, the measures for restricting the import of non-essential goods were announced, and the Central Bank was responsible for implementation. The measures classify imported goods into two categories: necessities and non-necessities. There are 65 categories of necessities, and non-necessities are luxury goods, consumables, and goods that are already produced domestically. All import firms must fill out an import exchange certificate when applying for foreign exchange from the Central Bank. If the import is a necessity, foreign exchange will be supplied as much as possible, otherwise it will not be supplied. As for which are necessities and which are non-necessities, since it involves various industries greatly, no official announcement has been seen to date. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. Imports of luxury goods have been sharply reduced, and the overall import surplus has been reduced as a result. The following is a comparison of the imports of luxury goods in the past three years:

### Japanese Warship Damaged and Towed to Shanghai - Workers Unwilling to Repair - Traitor Seizes Profit and Contracts for Urgent Repairs - Workers Understand the Greater Good and Will Not Be Used

After the Japanese side suffered heavy casualties in the Wuhan campaign due to the strong resistance of the Chinese army, they were safely ordered to withdraw the main force without loss, but the Japanese side suffered heavy losses. Among them, the Japanese naval fleet repeatedly tried to break through the Yangtze River blockade line on the outskirts of Wuhan and was fired upon by the Chinese army and bombed by aircraft, resulting in heavy casualties. Recently, one of the largest Japanese transport ships, with a deadweight of 15,000 to 16,000 tons, was sunk by Chinese aircraft in Jiangxi. The Japanese dispatched several crane ships to salvage it and towed it to Shanghai a few days ago, where it was opened to the No. 3 dock of the former Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs. It is said that the repair project of the "Kamui Maru" is still contracted by the traitorous merchant Wu Ashun and others, priced at 23,000 yuan. Because the Japanese Navy urgently needs the ship to transport soldiers, the deadline for completion is three weeks. Wu Ashun has been going around recruiting skilled workers from the former Jiangnan Shipyard to work in Nanshi, and each person is given a few yuan of salary in advance. The workers of the shipyard, in this time of national crisis, are acting with patriotic conscience and refusing to be used by traitors, and have refused with strong words. Under the pressure of hunger and cold, the workers deeply understand the greater good, which is admirable.

### Income Tax in This City - Last Year's Situation Was Good - Increase in Profits from Business Operations and Interest

Income tax is one of the direct good taxes of the country. Since its collection began in the 25th year, the total national income has not been able to meet the original budget due to changes in the situation and the fact that it has not been promoted for long. The entire income tax revenue has now been clearly designated as the guarantee for the 27th year's national defense public debt. Therefore, the position of income tax in the entire wartime finance is even more important. It is learned that the situation of income tax collection in this city was that in the 25th year, it accounted for more than two-fifths of the national total. In the 26th year, companies and firms paid profits from business operations enthusiastically, accounting for an important position in the total revenue, and income from government bonds and deposit interest also accounted for the majority. The situation changed dramatically in the 27th year. The damage to industry and commerce was extremely severe, and it is not yet possible to know what the composition of future collections will be. However, according to the current situation, it is actually still good, because under the abnormal development of industry and commerce in this city, business operations are very developed. At the end of the year, most accounts show profits, and the small income tax can be paid in full. Moreover, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has informed various industry associations to notify member companies and firms to pay together to increase national treasury revenue and maintain the important position of income tax in the entire finance. Therefore, it is expected that the collection of income tax in the 27th year, in addition to temporary profits and salaries of civil servants, the income from profits of companies and firms and the income from interest on government bonds and deposits will certainly exceed the numbers of the 25th and 26th years.

### Tsinghua Alumni Association to Hold a Social Gathering

Although most members of the Shanghai Tsinghua Alumni Association have left Shanghai one after another due to work-related reasons, there are still quite a few members. It is learned that the association, in order to connect with all alumni, has decided to hold a dinner and social gathering at the East Hall on the 9th floor of the YMCA in Baixianqiao starting at 7:00 PM on the 6th of this month (Friday), with various excellent programs to add to the fun. In addition to inviting Dr. Yan Huiqing to give a speech, music is the most exciting item. There will be male and female soprano and bass solos and choruses accompanied by various instruments, and violin solos. In addition to the well-known French couple Mr. and Mrs. Gautova in Shanghai, the performers are all people with rich musical literacy, such as Ms. Huang Youkui and Mr. Si Yigui. Some are famous Western songs, some are masterpieces of the late Professor Huang Zi of the National Conservatory of Music and Music Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and some are excellent works of the current Music Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council and Professor Li Weining of the National Conservatory of Music. The conductor is also Mr. Li. Therefore, the value of this performance is very high and cannot be compared to ordinary performances. It is said that each admission ticket is only sold for two yuan in national currency, and people have been enthusiastically buying them in recent days.

### People from Dinghai in Shanghai Received News from Their Hometown Police Yesterday - Large Numbers of Pirates Running Rampant - Marine Police Were Prevented from Landing

According to reliable sources in this city yesterday, the situation in Dinghai is extremely bad. Large numbers of pirates first robbed Xiaqi, then Taohua, and recently coveted the city of Chu, causing residents to panic and be startled several times a night. The officials and gentry of the county, believing that the police force was weak and unable to suppress them, telegraphed the Haimen authorities to dispatch capable marine police to Dinghai to assist in the suppression. Unexpectedly, before the marine police arrived, the pirates had already landed at Qutou, causing great panic among the residents. On the morning of the day before yesterday, the US Mei Da transport ship of the American Mei Li Company arrived in Dinghai from Haimen. The ship was carrying a large number of marine police who intended to dock immediately. When the pirates saw the arrival of the marine police, they immediately opened fire to resist arrest. The marine police were unable to land, and the ship was forced to turn back to Zhushanmen and anchor for a moment. After the marine police hired a small boat to land, the ship sailed to Ningbo. After hearing the news, people from Dinghai in Shanghai telegraphed to inquire, but as of yesterday evening, no reply had been received. Therefore, the situation thereafter is unknown.

### Loss of Deposit Slips, Passbooks, and Seals: Banks Adopt Notarization Method, Aiming to Reduce Bank Liability and Protect Depositors

When depositors request to report the loss of bank deposit slips, passbooks, and seals used for withdrawals, banks have traditionally required depositors to publish a notice in the newspaper and provide a guarantor. This method could be barely applicable in normal times. However, since the outbreak of war, the industry has gradually found this method difficult, as the number of loss incidents has been increasing daily, and the cumulative amount has become enormous. The risk borne by the banks is excessively high, and it is also difficult for depositors to find a guarantor. Considering both the bank's responsibility and the convenience of depositors, it seems necessary to seek alternative remedies. The Shanghai Bank suggested to the Bankers Association to adopt a notarization method as a remedy. The association then sent letters to various banks to solicit their opinions and also sent a letter to the court requesting instructions. The Banking Association's Practical Research Committee, based on the opinions of various parties and the information provided by various banks, held several meetings to discuss and make several decisions. The conclusions of the discussion were sent to the Bankers Association for reference. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency, considering the importance of the matter, specially added the original letter as follows:

Dear Sirs, Regarding the problem of loss of deposit slips, passbooks, and seals, the Banking Practice Research Committee of this association has held multiple meetings to discuss it. As a result, it is generally agreed that during this wartime period, if the loss of passbooks, deposit slips, and seals is still handled according to the traditional methods of various banks, requiring depositors to publish a notice in the newspaper and provide a guarantor, it will be quite difficult. From the depositor's point of view, they are moving around, unfamiliar with the area, and finding a guarantor is quite difficult. For those with larger deposits, they feel even more helpless. From the bank's point of view, the depositor's declaration in the newspaper that the item is void is not enough to relieve the bank's liability. Currently, loss incidents are increasing daily, and there is a need for another remedy. This association proposes three principles for resolving this case: (1) A cooperative method must be sought to reduce the bank's liability; (2) Detailed regulations must be in place to protect depositors; (3) The procedure must be simplified to reduce the depositor's expenses. Research has shown that although the traditional method of providing a guarantor and publishing a notice meets the principle of simplified procedure, it clearly does not meet the above two principles. As for the owner applying to the local court for public summons and a judgment of exclusion of rights, although there are provisions for this in the regulations (in the past, there was no such need in practice, and depositors applying to the court for public summons were rare before the war), but according to the provisions of the Civil Procedure Law, the procedure for public summons and judgment of exclusion of rights only applies to securities. A seal is not a security, and can a deposit slip be interpreted as a security? The court's views are also inconsistent. Recently, in the Shanghai First Special District and Hankou, there have been cases of applying to the court for public summons due to the loss of passbooks, and the rulings of the local district courts are completely different, making it feel that it is not applicable. Even if the public summons procedure can be used, the time required is very long, and the cost of publishing in the newspaper is very high, which causes considerable pain to the parties involved, especially for small depositors, which is quite contrary to the above third principle. Moreover, filing a confirmation lawsuit with the court is even more difficult in terms of law and fact. It is unreasonable to make the deposit bank the plaintiff. If the deposit bank is the defendant, the deposit bank itself is not the party at fault. The depositor is the one who failed to keep it safe. According to the law, the bank has no reason to lose the case. Moreover, after the plaintiff wins the first instance, the deposit bank will inevitably file appeals in the second and third instances, dragging out the litigation and increasing the loss. In fact, it is not a feasible method. After repeated discussions, this association believes that under the current special circumstances, in order to reduce the bank's liability and at the same time consider the convenience of protecting depositors, comparatively speaking, adopting the notarization method suggested by the Shanghai Bank is the most appropriate (omitted). However, it is doubtful whether this method falls within the scope of statutory notarization. If it is decided to adopt this method at present, it seems that your association should submit a request to the Judicial Yuan or the Ministry of Judicial Administration for interpretation. If it is considered feasible, please instruct the courts in various places to accept it. If your association can send representatives to the judicial authorities to explain the whole matter in detail, it would be even more comprehensive. The above is the result of the discussion of the Banking Practice Research Committee of this association. It is excerpted and sent for your reference. Please consider it carefully. It is said that the member banks of the Bankers Association have already adopted the notarization method.

Salary Dispute

Chen Lianzhou, currently residing at No. 131 Museum Road, formerly at Room 106, No. 457 Hankou Road, is involved in a salary dispute with Jin Zhongying, the owner of the Yuye Company. The case is in court. Now, Chen Lianzhou has submitted a statement to the court requesting preservation of evidence. It is claimed that the petitioner was commissioned by Jin Zhongying, the owner of the China Yuye Company, in September of the 25th year of the Republic of China as the manager of the company's mining department, with an agreement of 1,900 yuan. Apart from receiving 560 yuan, there is still 1,340 yuan owed, which has not been paid. The petitioner lives in the Chinese district of Huajie Min Road, which was destroyed during the Shanghai war last year. Only the company's account books can be used as evidence. However, the company has also ceased operations, and all account books are temporarily stored in Room 106, No. 457 Hankou Road, without any responsible personnel in charge. There is a risk of loss. The court sent personnel to deliver the documents a few days ago and has verified all these circumstances, as seen in the bailiff's report. These account books are sufficient to prove that the petitioner should receive his monthly salary. The court is requested to approve the preservation and deposit all the above-mentioned account books with the court as evidence. It is heard that the court will rule to provide for safekeeping, and it is also heard that this case will continue to be heard soon.

Jingan Temple Post Office New Year Dinner Party

All the staff of the Jingan Temple Post Office in this city, in order to strengthen their relationships and celebrate the victory of the National Army's resistance war in the 28th year of the Republic of China, held a dinner party at the Hongyunlou Restaurant on Wuma Road on the second day of the new year. More than 100 employees attended. During the dinner, they toasted and exchanged drinks, and the atmosphere was very lively. The decision to hold this dinner party was to completely eliminate all bad habits and extravagant consumption. Moreover, in view of the fact that the market is full of inferior goods, and it is difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake, and due to environmental factors, the propaganda methods cannot be fully utilized, resulting in the almost complete deprivation of the market for domestic goods, the organizers pre-requested various products from major domestic goods factories and stores as prizes. Each participating employee drew lots to determine the amount of prizes in order to widely promote domestic goods. The meaning is very profound. The companies and factories that donated products include Zhonghua Book Company, Commercial Press, Buddhist Bookstore, Shanghai Candy Factory, Datong Tobacco Company, Xietai Bulb Factory, Baoyuan Paper Store, Guoguang Harmonica Factory, Rongye Paper Bag Factory, Xinchang White Factory, Taiyitang Chinese Medicine Store, Wang Hexing, Jingming Glass Factory, Zhongfa Pharmaceutical Factory, Kangyuan Canning Factory, Xingguang Toy Company, Home Industry Cooperative, Fountain Pen Hospital, Zhongfa Pharmacy, Qianxin Sauce Shop, and other major companies and factories. All of these are goods of excellent quality and are a grand event.

### Multiple Car Accidents in the Eastern District of Shanghai, German Car Collides with Japanese Car, French Concession's Prevention of Accidents Proves Effective

According to the North China Daily News, at about 1 p.m. yesterday (the 2nd), a German drove his private car to visit the war zone. At the intersection of Tangshan Road and Zhaofeng Road in the Huishan District, it collided with a public bus operated and driven by a Japanese. As a result, a German woman residing in the Broadway Mansion was injured in the private car. Fortunately, the injury was not serious, and she was sent back to her home. However, the car was severely damaged. Also, at 8:15 a.m. on New Year's Day, a Chinese driver drove

A German Truck

A German truck collided with a Japanese three-wheeled motorcycle at the intersection of Yuanfang Road and East Broadway Road. The motorcycle belonged to the Japanese Marine Corps and was driven by a Japanese Marine soldier. A Japanese student was sitting in the sidecar and another in the back seat. The collision was extremely violent. The motorcycle even caught fire, and the student in the sidecar was burned to death. Another student was also injured. However, the Marine soldier was apparently not injured. Yesterday, a senior official of the French Concession Police Department told reporters that

New Year Holidays

During the New Year holidays, there were no major car accidents in the French Concession. However, the police department is definitely conducting a campaign to reduce many truck accidents. Special patrolmen are stationed in the more busy thoroughfares of the French Concession to patrol. Day and night, they can stop heavy trucks at any time and use special equipment to test the braking performance of the vehicle. This campaign began two months ago. It is difficult to have an accurate calculation of accidents and make a comparison with those in 1937. They definitely hope that this year's

Fatal Accidents

The number of fatal accidents can be greatly reduced. There were 51 car accidents that resulted in death last year, but since the outbreak of war in 1937, traffic in the French Concession has become increasingly busy. They have various reasons to believe that if the braking performance is carefully tested on time and found to be below standard, a fine will be imposed. As a result, the number of deaths and injuries caused by traffic accidents must be reduced. When the reporter asked whether ordinary cars would also be tested in the same way, the official said that they were not tested because the police department did not want to cause unnecessary inconvenience to pedestrians. However, if the police department believes that it will be necessary to test ordinary passenger cars in the future, it will also do so.

### Huang Tianhuan Steals a Huge Amount of Money from His Master, Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment for Continuous Theft, His Nephew Yanping Detained for 30 Days

Huang Tianhuan, a servant from Nanhai, Guangdong, who worked for Chen Qibiao at No. 80 Seymour Road, stole a huge amount of property from his employer and spent it all at the Changsheng Pawnshop. After the crime was discovered, he fled. The victim reported it to the police, and the detectives first arrested Huang Yanping, Huang's nephew, who was living at Huang's residence, for trying to withdraw US$2,000 from Citibank using the stolen deposit book. Then, Tianhuan was intercepted at the pier as he was about to board the Dingsheng Ferry to Shantou. He was also apprehended and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, it is learned that the principal offender, Huang Tianhuan, also known as A Niu, is only 21 years old. He was hired by the Chen residence, first as a servant boy, and later promoted to manager, earning a monthly salary of ten yuan. His motivation for theft began in the spring when he happened to find two keys to the master's inner room. He privately opened the boxes and cabinets and also obtained the key to the iron box, which he also opened. The contents of the box, besides 500 yuan in legal tender and deposit books for US$2,000 and over 800 yuan in legal tender, were all gold and silver jewelry, utensils, jade ornaments, and other items. Since then, Tianhuan has been able to take and carry them at will without any scruples. This iron box had not been opened by the Chen family for several years. Tianhuan pawned everything he stole, but at first he pawned and redeemed them. Since autumn, gambling dens in the Caojiadu area of ​​western Shanghai have been flourishing. Among them, the "Rongsheng Company" is larger in scale and has many ways to cheat money. The general pig herders are rushing to it because the place can cater to their preferences. Tianhuan also indulged in it, and often lost in gambling. Therefore, every time he lost, he stole the contents of the box and pawned them as bets, so that the pawned items were never redeemed. Currently, there are 79 pawn tickets that have been found. According to the police's estimate, the value of the items recorded on them is as high as 9,800 yuan, while the amount Tianhuan received from pawning them was only 2,300 yuan. On the day of his arrest, he only had 50 yuan of legal tender left on him, enough to prove that the remaining 2,200 yuan and the stolen 500 yuan of legal tender had all been offered to the so-called "Rongsheng Company" in half a year. The only thing he gained from it was a copper badge that he did not have time to take with him when he fled, which was left in his bedroom and searched out by the detectives. In addition, 40 unscratched lottery tickets for the grand lottery were also found. The police then interrogated the suspect based on the evidence obtained. He confessed to the whole process of stealing property, gambling debts, and absconding in four stages without any concealment. Yesterday, the police escorted the two Huangs to the First Special Court. Judge Fang Qinghai conducted a preliminary hearing. Police attorney Jiang Baolian stated the facts, presented the stolen goods and the badges issued to gamblers by "Rongsheng Company," and requested severe punishment. Huang Tianhuan confessed to all his actions. However, Huang Yanping claimed that his uncle had tricked him into withdrawing money from the bank and hired lawyer Huang Yuping to plead for leniency. The court verified the confessions and sentenced Huang Tianhuan to three years imprisonment for continuous theft and Huang Yanping to 30 days of detention for transporting stolen goods. The stolen goods and money were returned to the original owner.

Jin Zigang Passes Away

The police sent the defendant Wang Jinfu to the Second Special Court for interrogation, detention, and investigation. The details have been reported in the previous newspaper. The French Concession authorities are now prosecuting Wang for the crime of causing death by negligence in the course of his duties.

Filed a Public Prosecution

The case was heard by Judge Sun Pengxian the other day. The police attorney Chen Ming stated the investigation process. When Wang Jinfu was questioned, he confessed that when he was driving to the intersection of Edward Road and Beller Road, he saw a young deceased (referring to Zhang Miaorong, who died first) rushing diagonally from north to south in front of his car. He immediately tried to avoid him to the left, but the deceased still rushed over, causing him to be knocked down and crushed to death. He was unable to brake in time, and the car continued to drive forward, causing another death. It was impossible to avoid it. Then, the Western detectives from the Transportation Department reported

Investigation Process

And presented a map of the scene of the accident. The court verified the confessions and ordered a postponement for further investigation of the case. The defendant was remanded in custody. Regarding the loss of the victim Zhang Miaorong, it is heard that the company has negotiated with the corpse's family to give appropriate compensation. However, there is still no corpse's family to claim the body of the unknown man and request compensation.

At about 0:48 yesterday morning, an British national named Blan, 33 years old, somehow had the idea of ending his life and jumped from the fourth floor of No. 106 Beijing Road, Public Concession. He immediately lost consciousness and suffered serious injuries all over his body. The nearby guards rushed to the scene, urgently called an ambulance, and sent him to Gongji Hospital for treatment. His life is in danger.

Man Commits Suicide

At about 10:50 last night, a middle-aged man (in his thirties or forties), wearing a navy blue serge gown, yellow leather shoes, and a black felt hat, somehow had the idea of ending his life and jumped from a building at the Xinxin Company Amusement Park at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yu Qiaqing Road. He fell in the middle of Lloyd Road, barely breathing, and suffered injuries to his head and abdomen. The Lao Zha Police Station guard No. 2120 rushed to the scene, called an ambulance, and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died shortly after. The French Chamber of Commerce's Charity Lottery for Refugees was established to raise funds for refugees. As of the fourth issue, it has provided relief funds amounting to 250,000 yuan. The fifth issue is scheduled to be drawn on the 12th of this month. If it can be sold in full, 60,000 French francs will be allocated to refugee funds. Considering that it only costs two yuan a month to support one refugee, the lottery is issued monthly, and the relief funds allocated each month are enough to support 30,000 refugees. If it is issued monthly and allocated on schedule, the refugee funds will be endless. Therefore, all Chinese people are praising, encouraging purchases, and vigorously promoting it. Now that the drawing date is approaching, to avoid missing out, please buy it quickly. If purchasing is troublesome, you can call the general sales office of the Dagong Enterprise Company in the city at 19049, and it will be delivered immediately. Mail orders from other cities are also welcome and will be returned promptly.

### American Child Shoots Himself, Said to Have Committed Suicide Because There Was Nothing to Do, American Court Autopsies the Body Yesterday Morning

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, a friend of a foreigner, Pu Cai, who lived at No. 237 Nanyang Road, was alarmed by a gunshot this morning (the 3rd). He ran into Pu's room and saw that Pu's 16-year-old son was dead in the room. A bullet pierced his head, and a rifle was next to him. The tragedy occurred at 1:48 a.m. this morning. The police department was immediately notified, and the body was taken to Hong'en Hospital for examination and then to the mortuary. According to the child's friend, the child had the idea of suicide because there was nothing to do. Pu Cai is an American, so the U.S. court in Shanghai was notified this morning (the 3rd). Coroner Rawton examined the evidence gathered at the scene of the tragedy and the information provided by a Philippine friend of the deceased. It is currently being compiled. The U.S. court will hold a hearing tomorrow morning (the 4th).

### Racegoers' Club: Small Champagne Lottery Drawn Yesterday, Excellent Results, 14 Prize Numbers in Total, First, Second and Third Prizes to be Determined by Today's Races

The Shanghai Racegoers' Club, in order to support the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association and relieve refugees, specially issued New Year charity Small Champagne Lottery tickets. All proceeds from the commission, except for necessary expenses, will be used for relief, demonstrating a noble spirit and earning admiration. Thanks to the efforts of the club members in promoting the tickets, although the sales period was short, the results were even better than the club's autumn Small Champagne Lottery last year, which is truly a remarkable achievement. A total of 75,350 tickets were sold, each priced at 20 cents. The first prize is 5,754 yuan in national currency, the second prize is 1,644 yuan, the third prize is 822 yuan, and there are eleven small prizes, each worth 186.8 yuan, which is the highest record for small prizes in the club's history of issuing Small Champagne Lottery tickets. (According to the lottery rules, the draw is based on the horses registered for today's Shanghai Race Club Champagne Race (Seventh Race), with fourteen horses registered in total. Each horse has one number drawn, so there are fourteen prize numbers in total.) The lottery was held on time at 7:00 PM yesterday under the supervision of the club's board of directors and guests Zhu Zhongfu and Ye Danzhong. The winners of the first, second, and third prizes will be determined based on the results of today's Champagne Race. The prize numbers and their corresponding horse names are as follows:

Lu'an Fast Steamer Changes to Night Shift

The German-owned Hanwen Foreign Firm, operated by the Keli Shipping Company at No. 27 Zilai Street in the French Concession, has changed the Lu'an Fast Steamer to a night shift starting from New Year's Day. The steamer travels at a steady speed, has comfortable seats, easy loading, and low fares. To reward customers, a 1928 lunar calendar is included with each ticket. Those traveling to Xinkou, Jiaqiao, and Zhangjiagang can contact the Taifeng Ticket Office at No. 5 Waitan, Xinkaihe, or the Fushun Travel Agency at No. 133 Avenue Edward VII.

### Market Briefs

Wool Felt and Paper-Wrapped Cloth Selling Well. The Shanghai Tap Water Appliance Company at No. 484 Jiangxi Road sells high-quality wool felt, paper-wrapped cloth, and gray-topped felt, which are used to protect boilers and indoor and outdoor pipes. Once wrapped, they can maintain heat and indirectly save on coal consumption. During the cold season, various factories are installing these products from the company, resulting in brisk sales. The previous stock was sold out, and now a large batch of new goods has arrived in Shanghai. Those who wish to commission installation can contact the company or Mr. Lu Wenzhong.

Daye Cloth Sales Brisk. The riding breeches cloth, Watet cloth, and Mackintosh cloth produced by Daye have been selling well recently, especially the original-color yellow-gray military uniform cloth, which sells for 1.35 yuan per single width. The Ministry of Industry has a record of this. The factory's buildings are located at the junction of Yidingpan Road and South Caojiazhai Road, and the main wholesale location is in Qingshun Lane, Beijing Road. The annual turnover is very large, making it a shining example for the domestic goods industry.

### Medical News

Dr. Tu Qihua Expands Clinic Services. Dr. Tu Qihua, a well-known venereologist in Meifuli, Pike Road, is known for his well-equipped clinic and dedicated service, and is praised by all levels of society. Therefore, those suffering from gonorrhea and other venereal diseases naturally seek his services. Recently, due to the busy clinic schedule, and in order to save time for patients and expedite examinations, he has spared no expense in adding a second examination room and a women's treatment center, so that patients can receive convenient care. All equipment has also been completely renovated, and Dr. Li Tianya has been hired to head the treatment department. Those who are poor and sick are charged only a registration fee of 20 cents each time, from 2 PM to 4 PM daily.

It is said that a registration fee is charged.

### Today's Wuxi Industry: Large Factories Mostly Rely on Others' Guidance, Small Silk Factories Can Achieve Self-Reliance

— Caihua

Wuxi, one of China's four major rice markets and a key town on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, boasts the most developed industry in the province. Before the war, there were nine textile factories, over fifty silk factories, four flour mills, and over a hundred rice shops. Since the occupation over a year ago, Wuxi has been filled with dark clouds and evil shadows. All industries have suffered unprecedented devastation. Major factories have been monopolized by the Japanese, and even small businesses are controlled by them. Disguised subsidiaries of the Central China Silk Company and trading firms like Da Ji and Da Xing are holding Wuxi's industrial throat, preventing it from breathing. This article is merely a report on the current state of Wuxi industry, inevitably missing details. I respectfully request colleagues to supplement and correct it.

Textile Factories

Before the war, there were seven factories, including Shen, Zhenxin, Lixin, Guangqin, Yeqin, Qingfeng, and Yukang. Qingfeng and Shenxin factories were the largest in scale, while Lixin factory produced the most. Most of the factory buildings were destroyed, and many of the internal parts were also damaged. Shenxin and Zhenxin factories were repaired by personnel sent by the Japanese Shanghai Spinning Co., Ltd., while Yukang Yarn Factory was repaired by personnel sent by the Shanghai Dakang Yarn Factory. Weixin and Xiexin factories were established in October last year and briefly started operations when new cotton was available, but there was not much business.

Flour Mills

The flour mills suffered less damage than the silk and yarn industries. Fuxin and Maoxin factories suffered the most damage. Guangfeng Flour Mill has already started operations, and Jiufeng is preparing to do so. Of course, this kind of operation still reveals a miserable state, relying on the Japanese!

Silk Factories

The silk industry undoubtedly leads Wuxi's industry. In its heyday, there were over fifty silk factories, over 13,000 silk reeling machines, and over 60,000 workers. Now, the total number of silk reeling machines is less than a fraction of what it used to be, showing the state of the industry. However, the Japanese think it is profitable and are unwilling to let go, so they specially organized the "Central China Silk Company" to control it. The factories that have resumed operations include Zhenchang, Zhenyuan, Dasheng, Dingchang, Hongyu, Fulun, Runkang, Hefeng, Dingsheng, and nine others.

The so-called "Central China Silk Company" is a black box. The capital amount is nominally 8 million yuan, but in reality, it is probably worthless. Outsiders cannot know the details. The profit distribution is 60% to the Japanese and 40% to the Chinese. The purpose of the "Central China Company" is to control the silk industry in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang war zones. The head office is located in Hongkou, Shanghai, and branch offices are located in Wuxi and Suzhou. The "Wuxi Central China Silk Company" is located at the Maoziqiao Bridge in the city. The organization has a Japanese general manager. Under the general manager, each factory has a supervisor, who is also Japanese. The factory directors are Japanese, and the deputy factory directors are Chinese. There are three departments: sorting, engineering, and administration. The duties of each department are as follows: Sorting Department: opening factory, sorting room, inspection room; Engineering Department: raw material selection room, boiling room, silk reeling room, factory, warehouse, waste silk room, power room, repair room; Administrative Department: accounting, labor relief, general affairs, miscellaneous affairs. The details of the silk factories that have started operations are listed below:

At the same time, it is worth mentioning that some silk industry employees have a lot of integrity and creativity. On the one hand, they are unwilling to find work at the "Central China Company," and on the other hand, they cannot tighten their belts for the sake of their families. Under these circumstances, a large number of small family silk factories have emerged. These small silk factories have a maximum of eight to twelve silk reeling machines, and some have only four. The most have twenty machines. All the silk reeling machines and equipment were bought from the destroyed factories at extremely low prices of twenty to thirty yuan each. The so-called factory is in the home, with silk reeling machines and equipment installed simply. They work day and night, and the output is considerable, and they can also get considerable profits. "Self-reliance" is truly admirable!

Rice Industry

Next is the rice industry. Originally, the rice market was located in the area outside the North Gate. Because of the heavy losses suffered in the war, there are now about seventy rice shops that have resumed operations and newly established ones. The scope of business is not as large as before the war. Now, they are limited to small businesses in the city and cannot even talk about exporting. Even if they could export, they would have to cooperate with the Japanese. Not only are the donation and tax procedures troublesome, but there is also a great deal of risk.

In short, Wuxi's current industry is only one-tenth of what it was before the war. It is a black box, with grasping hands of exploitation everywhere. Instead of lingering under the heavy oppression of the Japanese, why not relocate the factories to the interior and engage in production needed for the war of resistance? This would not only allow the unemployed to return to the factories and participate in production, but also develop the industry in the interior, benefiting both the country and the nation!

### Finance: Gold Prices Fluctuate Significantly in December

Last December, the spot price of gold in the open market continued the trend of the previous month, hovering around 2,030 yuan for about two weeks. Then, as news of international loans gradually leaked out, the market was affected. After the loan announcement was made public, the market price fell sharply. In a few days, it entered the 2,000 yuan mark, reaching a low of 1,958 yuan on the 24th. Fortunately, the Hong Kong group continued to buy, without interruption, which helped maintain the market price and prevented it from falling further. Furthermore, Premier Chiang Kai-shek's statement that China would rather not surrender immediately boosted the market. At the same time, the Tianjin group also began to purchase. Under these two waves of buying, the market price once broke through the 2,000 yuan mark. Ultimately, due to inconsistent foreign exchange conditions and the year-end financial needs of local dealers, the bulls took profits, causing the price to fall back within the 2,000 yuan mark. Therefore, the spot market in the previous month can be described as trending from high to low, with a daily decline, which is also powerful evidence of the consolidation of the foundation of our national currency. As for trading, it was also less impressive. The total turnover was 19,040 taels, a decrease of over 4,000 taels compared to the previous month's 23,070 taels. The money exchange industry still maintained a buying position due to acting as an agent for the Hong Kong group, so the net inflow after offsetting purchases and sales was also over 4,000 taels. The securities industry was second, also on the buying side. Other industries, such as silver shops and spot gold dealers, were in a selling position. The turnover statistics of various industries in December are listed on the left (unit: taels):

Seller　Buyer　Net Inflow/Outflow

Money Exchange Industry　5,500　9,540　Inflow 4,040

Gold Dealers　5,470　3,770　Outflow 1,700

Silver Shops　6,510　3,860　Outflow 2,690

Visiting Dealers　700　310　Outflow 390

Securities Industry　860　1,560　Inflow 700

Total　19,040 taels

### Silver Prices Rise by 10 Annas

Bombay, 2nd. Silver spot prices suddenly increased by 10 annas, futures by 11 annas. Also, New York reports that the price of American silver is still quoted but no transactions are taking place, maintaining the original price. The price of British silver bars is suspended, no report is available.

### Sugar Market: Domestic Green Sugar Rises with Brown and White Sugar

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten. The association's quoted price for Taikoo sugar was 23.8 yuan per B mark for delivery at Pudong godown, a rebound of 30 cents; 24 yuan for delivery at Puxi godown, with refunds offered for lower grades. Grade 24 Dutch raw white sugar was 24.4 yuan, transit sugar was 16.2 yuan. For domestic sugar, the Chaozhou group quoted medium grade refined white sugar at 21.5 yuan, also an increase from before. Since the tightening of refined brown sugar, it has gradually become firmer. Yesterday, the high brand refined brown sugar opened at 15.25 to 15.3 yuan, the second grade at 14.65 yuan, and the lowest grade at 12.8 yuan. Green sugar was active due to the rise in brown and white sugar. Common grade sugar opened at 12.6 yuan, Huanggang green at 12 yuan, and the second grade at 11.7 to 11.5 yuan, with a total of 2,500 to 2,600 bags traded. According to a letter from Quanzhou, the current new sugar harvest is poor, only four to five tenths of last year's.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn and Cotton Market to Open on the 5th, Still Hopeful for an Uptrend

Due to the financial industry's holiday at the beginning of the year, the local yarn and cotton market was naturally unable to be active. According to the opinions of most industry members, it is predicted that the market will open on the 5th. Barring unexpected stimuli, there is hope for an upturn in the cotton industry. However, it is noted that speculators in the market and banks are heavily stockpiling cotton cloth, and public opinion is that China's position on the war of resistance is consistent. The inspection of imported goods in the interior is very strict. In this regard, there should be continued and unremitting demand for China-British yarn. However, at the end of last year, hoarding was full, and speculative transactions exceeded actual transactions by a factor of one. If prices are too high after the market opens, there is a deep fear that those who want to take profits will come out, and there may be a decline or softening. However, the amount of cotton yarn and cotton cloth exported to Chaozhou, Shantou, Kunming, Haiphong, Yunnan, etc. has been large recently. The same steps are being taken in eastern Zhejiang, so the foundation of the market is moving towards a healthier path.

### North-South Goods: Japanese Pagoda Flower Seeds Trending Firm

Japanese Pagoda Flower Seeds from Huai Prefecture and Hao Prefecture are scarce in both shipments and inventories. Although the demand is not particularly strong, the trend is very firm. Yesterday, the market was sold at 23 yuan. Tianjin goods are difficult to arrange due to high external costs and exchange rates, so inventory is fully available.

### Peach Kernel Prices Advancing

Peach kernels are of the highest quality when from Lanxi, and those produced in Jiangxi are next. Previously, the market sold for 32 yuan per dan. As sales continued, the bottom gradually felt lacking, and recent sources are scarce and external expenses are more cumbersome. The cost of arrangements is 40 yuan, so the current market has risen to 45 yuan, and its momentum is stable.

### Grain: Highland Rice in Very Strong Demand

After Highland Rice and Superior Rice were both closed for two days, the demand on this street was extremely greedy. Especially the low prices of goods from the big market were welcomed by retail customers, so the buying was extremely strong in the morning. Prices for medium and lower grades all rose by a few cents, while high-quality goods were mostly not formally delivered due to the insistence of the cargo owners. Because the cost has increased after the goods were purchased by Japanese merchants and directly re-exported from the production area, not only has the cost increased, but also transportation is difficult. Therefore, both newly arrived and previously stored goods are intended to be firmly held to await better prices. Although the market rose by a few cents yesterday, only more than 1,000 bags were traded. Common grade Wu rice opened at 9.6 to 9.7 cents, and high-quality Wu rice required more than 10 yuan. Nanjing special Chungpu rice was shouted at 10.45 yuan, but there were no transactions.

### Rain Increases Rice Prices, 20,000 Dan Sold

Yesterday, the rice market in Xiahe reopened as usual. There were more than thirty boats, including steamers and truck shipments, totaling about 10,000 bags. Transactions in the city's rice shops were busier because store needs were more frequent after the New Year's holiday for two days. Ship owners, on the other hand, said that rice prices in the interior had risen sharply by 30 to 40 cents, and there was fear that sources would not be able to be further increased. Moreover, people are happier with the rain, and the market immediately raised prices. Nearly 20,000 dan were traded throughout the day. New rice and Bojing rice each rose by one or two cents, and Dujian, Yangjian, and Pujian rice followed suit, with cent increases. Glutinous rice was sold quickly, and the increase was even more urgent. The highest price for Liyang goods has reached 13.6 to 13.7 yuan.

### Hardware: White Lead Wire Sales Gradually Moving

The white lead wire market has been quiet for a long time. However, its trend has shown promise in recent days. Architectural and Fujian groups are purchasing, and interior groups are also inquiring, so the market situation is very lively. Although the market has not improved for the time being, those holding goods are still unwilling to sell cheaply, so the standard remains steady. More than 300 bundles were opened yesterday. Coarse patterns were sold for 15.25 yuan, medium grade patterns for 15.75 yuan, and fine patterns for 16.2 yuan. As no new goods have arrived and market inventories are running dry, the future market situation is very promising.

### Coal Prices at the Beginning of the Year Rise Immediately

The various types of white coal have seen increased sales recently due to the severe cold weather. Local shop owners and inland merchants have shown interest, and the market has become increasingly tight. Yesterday, the new year trading session opened and immediately saw prices rise. Hongqi lump coal was priced at 50 yuan per ton, cut lump at 48 yuan, medium lump at 45 yuan, small lump at 46 yuan, and coal dust remained at the original price, without much change. This is because the arrival of lump coal has been scarce lately, and warehouse stocks are very low, so prices have to be raised to show restrictions.

### Canada Calculation of Gold Production Costs

The Royal Bank of Canada's December report states that during the recent economic downturn, the economic stability of Canada has been significantly assisted by the gold mining industry. From 1935 to 1937, Canada's gold production was abundant, with a total production of 4,096,215 ounces in 1937. In the first eight months of this year, the production amount was 3,051,081 ounces, while in the same period last year it was 2,672,812 ounces. Therefore, the production in 1938 is expected to have a new record.

So, what kind of assistance does the gold mining industry have for the social economy? The recent analysis by the Bureau of Internal Affairs Statistics is as follows: Canadian gold mining companies, excluding employee salaries, spent more than 40 million U.S. dollars on industrial equipment, electricity, fuel, water, insurance, etc. in 1937. If the same investigation is done for the 1935 fiscal year, the expenses have increased by more than 40% in the past two years. As the cash mining industry continues to develop, its contribution to the promotion and success of other industries in Canada will inevitably increase day by day. In 1937, gold mining industry expenditures included more than one million yuan for mining drills and parts, 1.25 million yuan for lead and iron pipe equipment, 1.5 million yuan for electrical equipment, 1.01 million yuan for steel purchases, more than 5 million yuan for machine purchases, 2.85 million yuan for wood, and 1.32 million yuan for other building materials. At the same time, the chemical and related industries also benefited significantly, such as dynamite consumption worth 4.7 million yuan, "alloy decay products" worth 1.46 million yuan, other chemical products worth 500,000 yuan, and electricity consumption worth 4.51 million yuan. But this is only the main driving force. As for kerosene and gasoline, it requires 957,000 yuan, coal requires 760,000 yuan, railway freight requires 2.41 million yuan, and workers' insurance premiums and other insurance premiums total more than 2.62 million yuan. With a consumption of 40 million yuan, which is used from one industry to another, the amount is considerable. However, it is still not enough. In 1939, the gold mining industry employed a total of 25,000 miners, with wage expenditures reaching 58 million yuan. Then, combining the calculations, the total expenditure of the gold mining industry in 1937 was close to 100 million yuan. (A)

### New Year's Hopes

— Qin

Time flies so fast: The 27th year has passed like a flash!

When we look back on this year, have we done our best to help our compatriots in distress? In today's situation where the whole country has suffered from war, we live in Shanghai and live a safe and comfortable life. Are we suspected of despising the disaster?

The New Year is here! Every household is full of joy. In this joyful sound, let us not forget the miserable situation of the compatriots in distress! Don't have meaningless joy! It is shameful to say that the four million compatriots living in Shanghai cannot help the tens of thousands of refugees in Shanghai to escape their painful lives! How can we not feel heartache when we see the refugees sleeping on the cement pavements next to the road!

From now on, we should strive to save people from disaster and engage in meaningful work!

I hope that in the 28th year:

(1) To enable compatriots sleeping in the open to spend the winter safely,

(2) To ensure that all refugees in the shelters are supported!

(3) To give homeless children on the streets food and clothing; and opportunities to receive education.

(4) To provide the children who sell newspapers in the morning and evening with opportunities to study at the newspaper boy school when they are not working!

This is a minimum hope!

We know that saving refugees is saving the country. Saving one more refugee is saving one more of the nation's vitality. We should participate in the work of saving people from disaster and make it the central work of the 28th year. I hope that the compatriots in Shanghai will work together to put it into practice!

New Year Games

### Guessing Age

— Yi

In the New Year's Eve celebration at school, there were wonderful programs such as singing and dancing. Among them, a clever child performed a game of guessing age. His method is very simple and very interesting. Now I will write down the game.

Juemin--"The New Year is here and we are all getting a year older. Today I am going to guess everyone's age. Who wants me to guess? "Yihua busy said:" Please guess how old I am this year? "

Juemin: "Okay! Now I write down a formula "89×9×your age" and put your age into the formula, and then calculate it carefully. Don't make any mistakes, show me the answer - I can guess your age.

Yihua - turned his back to Juemin and put his age of 11 into the formula, which became "". After calculating, he showed the answer "" to Juemin.

Juemin glanced at it and said, "You are eleven years old, right?"

Yihua: "Ah! How can you be so accurate? What's the reason?"

Juemin: "Look! Aren't the last two digits of the answer "eleven"? So I can immediately say "eleven". Do you know that the last two digits are the reason for your age?"

Yihua thought for a while and clapped his hands and laughed: "I know, I know, "" multiplied by age, of course the last two digits are the number of age. "

Juemin smiled and said: "That's right! But I can also guess your age and date of birth."

Yihua: "Good! Good! That's even better!"

Juemin: He wrote down a formula: He said to Yihua: "Put your age and date of birth into each position, calculate it carefully, show me the exact answer, and I can guess it!"

Yihua is eleven years old this year and was born on September 14th, so he put these numbers into the formula and calculated it. Then he gave the answer to Juemin to guess: Juemin calculated it and said, "You were born on September 14th, right?"

Yihua said, "How did you know that?"

Juemin: "This is very simple. In short, no matter who's age and date of birth you guess, just subtract "" from his answer. In this number: the two digits before the decimal point are the birthday; the two digits after the decimal point are the age; the last two digits are the birth month. Now look!" In this number, aren't the two numbers after the decimal point ""? Aren't the last two digits ""? Aren't the two numbers before the decimal point "one thousand"?

So I know you were born on September 14th.

Yihua clapped his hands and laughed, "Yes! Yes! This method is really interesting."

If you have read the above game, you may also try it. See if it's right or not.

### Moving Bicycle

— Yunyu

When the New Year comes, we often see many students and teenagers riding bicycles on the road. They have money, as long as they spend two angles on the car rental, they can ride on the car, which is really carefree, but what about the refugees in the shelter? They have no money and no chance to play, which is really boring. Now we also have a bicycle here, which can be played by anyone without charging car rental. Friends, are you happy or not?

This car is flexible and its speed is also very fast (see picture). Friends, don't you believe it? Wait a minute, you'll know after a try.

(1) First, cut out the pattern on the paper, and carefully look at the structure of the car, its style, which is the style of a sports car, so its speed is lighter than ordinary bicycles. Please take a closer look first.

(2) Then you can focus on the two discs, while constantly shaking in your hands - (like sifting grain) shaking for a minute.

(3) Finally, you can stop immediately and see if the two wheels are turning? Ha! Do you think it's strange? It simply turns so fast that you don't believe it. The faster you move, the faster it turns. If you keep going, it will turn until you are dizzy.

What is the reason? Who wants it to turn? Scientists tell us that this is an "illusion" of the eyes.

He said that usually when we look at something with our eyes, if we stare at it for too long, we will often see two shapes. For example, a table, as long as we are in a daze, in addition to a real table, we can also see the outline of a virtual table, which is the "illusion". Due to the effect of "illusion", we see two shapes.

Then, let's think about it. After this car has been watched after the first item, we have already been in a daze. Then we keep shaking the paper and continue to do the second work. Is there any reason why an illusion will not occur?

Understanding the reason, we can also understand the reason for "moving movies", because the structure of movies is also related to "illusion", but movies are not what we want to talk about in this article, so we don't need to talk about it too much.

### This Week's War

These days, the weather is cold. People on the isolated island are still afraid of the cold when they are in the house. When it comes to the war on the front line, it really makes people sigh.

Southern China

A few days ago, it was reported in the newspaper that more than 100 Japanese warships were concentrated in Beihai, and the situation was tense. When the news came, we felt that the situation in South China would change, because the Japanese army recently felt that the stalemate in the war in South China was difficult. There has to be a concentration of counter-offensive preparations. According to a Hong Kong telegram on the 23rd, the situation in the southern part of Kwangtung Province is very tense. Japanese warships are now gathered in Yangjiang, Dianbai, Beihai and other places, trying to seize the opportunity to land, and constantly firing artillery at the shore as an attempt to land. At the same time, the Japanese air force is also very active, flying to various places to scout and throw bombs. Now the war has broken out in Beihai Dianbai. The telegram also said that Japanese warships outside Beihai Port were constantly firing artillery to cover the landing of troops, but because the Chinese army's defense was tight, it has not succeeded so far. At present, the Chinese side has declared martial law and destroyed all the transportation routes leading to the mainland to prevent the Japanese army from invading Guangxi from there.

This news was still news from the beginning of the week. Up to the 31st, looking at the overall war in South China, it can be said that there has been no progress at all. This is not because the Japanese army is slackening on the war, but because the Chinese side is properly equipped and morale is high. Therefore, the latest news has always been in the chaos. According to the telegram from Qujiang, not only has the Japanese army made no progress, but the positions of Shengangxu, Dagangling and other positions in Conghua have been shaken by the Chinese army.

"The Qujiang telegram said that the Japanese army entrenched in Bietou was defeated by the Chinese army and retreated to Conghua. A certain unit of the Chinese army immediately divided and attacked Conghua. The Japanese army was extremely panic and retreated to the south. The Chinese army recovered Conghua City. In addition to sending troops to pursue, they also occupied the positions in Shengangxu, Dagangling and other areas."

According to a Reuters Hong Kong telegram: "According to news received here, the Chinese army in Beijiang began to attack Huaxian yesterday. Fierce battles are underway. The street fighting in Zengcheng is still extremely fierce. A Japanese team moved westward from Luofu Mountain yesterday in an attempt to rescue the Japanese army in Zengcheng, but was ambushed on the way. There is no major change in the Xijiang and Beihai areas."

From this point of view, although the Japanese army's reserve forces in South China have been increasing one after another, it is still a long way to go to achieve the predetermined goal because the Chinese side is doing its best to resist. Now both sides are preparing, and a fierce battle is about to begin.

On the Yuehan Road

There has also been contact recently. The Japanese army in Yueyang is still surrounded by the Chinese army. A certain unit of the Chinese army once rushed into Yueyang City and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army. Later, as the Japanese army continued to increase, the Chinese army withdrew from the city. The Chinese army on the Xiang-E Highway is now starting to attack Tongcheng to the north, and another unit is attacking Shaping between Chongyang and Tongcheng. In this way, the Japanese army's retreat to Tongcheng will be cut off.

According to the Japanese army's activities in the Xiangbian area, the question is whether it can maintain the existing situation with all its strength? If you want to connect the north and south lines and achieve the effect of taking care of each other, it may not be easy to implement.

Shanxi War

There was also contact this week, especially northwest of Linfen, which was the most intense. The Japanese army is now advancing westward in three routes, one route is advancing to Xiangning, one route is attacking Puxian, and one route is attacking the north of Xixian. Reports say that many Japanese planes have repeatedly flown to Daning, Xixian, and bombed the area. The Chinese army in Xixian is now the 115th Division. It has been fighting fiercely with the Japanese army in the southeast of Xixian, while the Chinese army in Puxian Xiangning is the 72nd and 69th Divisions led by General Yan Xishan, which are extremely well-equipped. This is to prevent the Japanese army from invading western Shanxi. Although this kind of contact has expanded, it is still a strategy to test the advance to the northwest, and it seems that they are still waiting for an opportunity to launch a large-scale attack.

But according to another telegram, the fierce fighting in the southwest of Shanxi Province is still in progress. The Japanese artillery unit on the east bank of the Yellow River in Shaanxi Province bombarded the Chinese army positions on the opposite bank of Yumen Ferry and the confluence of the Yellow River and the Fen River. The Chinese artillery unit on the west bank also retaliated fiercely. According to the Chinese authorities, a large number of Chinese troops have entered Shanxi Province for a long-term stay, waiting to deal with the incident. In view of this situation, it is by no means easy for the Japanese army to attack Shaanxi Province.

In addition, there is one more thing that deserves our attention, that is, the departure of Mr. Wang Jingwei! Mr. Wang Jingwei, the vice president of the Chinese Kuomintang, has recently asked the Central Government for leave and went abroad for recuperation. It is said that he was injured in an assassination two years ago, and now the old wound has relapsed and he needs to go abroad for recuperation. After the news came out, Mr. Wang had already left Chongqing, and his whereabouts have been very secretive since then. But this is not to say in detail. What deserves my attention is the reason for his sudden departure and his future actions. Some people say that Mr. Wang's departure is related to peace negotiations. This point is especially the most sensational propaganda of the Japanese side and Haitong News Agency.

However, after Chairman Chiang's explanation at the memorial week in Chongqing the other day, this kind of propaganda has disappeared. Chairman Chiang said: "It is rumored that Mr. Wang's decision to leave Chongqing is related to peace negotiations with Japan. This kind of bizarre news is purely unfounded. The purpose of the Japanese side's counter-propaganda is to confuse our hearing and shake the international recognition of China's resistance against Japan. Mr. Wang's departure from Chongqing is purely a personal action. To this day, no one will ever want to compromise and make peace with Japan again. Moreover, Mr. Wang's behavior in the world is sincere and upright, and the people of the country have seen it. Therefore, all the rumors outside are suspected of provoking discord and are not worthy of trust."

However, the evolution of this matter is still developing. Chairman Jiang's talk is just to measure Mr. Wang with the heart of a gentleman and not to do this. As of the date of this manuscript, it was suddenly telegraphed that Wang Jingwei actually suggested to the Central Government to negotiate peace with Japan, which is really surprising. Due to space limitations, let's hear the next breakdown.

### A Pilgrimage to the Refugee Self-Sufficiency Shelter (Part 1)

— Yixin

After the Shanghai War broke out last year, the charitable organizations in the two concessions in Shanghai did a lot. According to the statistics in March of this year, there were 200 shelters. Later, they gradually merged. Some of them were closed, and some of the shelters were changed into self-sufficiency shelters. What is the difference between a "self-sufficiency shelter" and a "shelter"? "Self-sufficiency" means to provide for oneself. The refugees inside are all able to produce themselves and maintain their own lives. The elderly and the young are supported by their relatives; the young and strong go out to find work, such as factories, peddlers, etc.; or work in the shelter, such as rattan work, woolen thread, lace, grass weaving, mops, sewing, etc. Those who cannot support themselves are moved to other shelters, and those who can support themselves are moved into self-sufficiency shelters. The refugees in the "shelter" are completely provided with food, clothing and shelter by the shelter. There is only consumption and no life; the "self-sufficiency shelter" only provides shelter, and they are responsible for their own food and clothing; this is the difference between the "shelter" and the "self-sufficiency shelter". The author has visited the authorities of each shelter to investigate the self-sufficiency situation. The situations of each shelter are different. Here, I have written down the situations of several self-sufficiency shelters for people who are concerned about the refugee issue.

(1) The First Self-Sufficiency Shelter: The location is in Qingliang Temple, Xinji Garden, Xinzao Road. All affairs are handled by the director and deputy director, and there are administrators to manage daily affairs. The refugees in the shelter were organized by 2,300 people who could support themselves in the Qingliang Shelter. Together with the service staff, there are a total of 724 people. The shelter is equipped with stoves to provide refugees with cooking. The expenses for water, electricity, and medicine are entirely provided by the Charity Association. In the future plan, five cents will be collected from each person per month to cover the expenses of water and electricity for the entire shelter. In terms of education in the shelter, adult education has not yet been held; in terms of children, there are currently five primary classes and one intermediate class; the total number of people is 285.

(2) The Second Self-Sufficiency Shelter: The address is Hetai Warehouse, North Fujian Road, with 553 refugees. The shelter has a director and a deputy director, and is divided into three sections: general affairs, personnel, and education. The general affairs section is divided into: 1. Document, 2. Accounting, 3. Food supply, 4. Health, 5. General affairs, 5 groups; The personnel section is divided into: 1. Production, 2. Public security, 3. Autonomy, 4. Registration, 4 groups; The education section is divided into: 1. Teaching, 2. Research, 3. Recreation, 3 groups. The shelter is a reorganization of Hetai Shelter. Most of the refugees in the shelter can support themselves. The shelter sells rice every day, at 100 Wen per catty. The food for the children studying in the shelter and the staff is provided by the shelter. The expenses for water, electricity, and medicine are borne by the Charity Association. There are currently three children's classes, including first grade, second grade, and third grade, with a total of 121 people. The educated children are allocated a separate area, and there is morning exercise for half an hour every morning. A small tea room is also opened in the shelter, specifically for adults to rest after work. At the same time, teachers often give lectures on common sense and current affairs, which is also a method of education, so that adults can receive ordinary knowledge outside of work and do not feel dull and spiritually bored.

### A Record of Attending the National Exhibition of Art by the Deaf and Mute - Now Closed, to be Exhibited Elsewhere

— Jue Zhi

The National Art Exhibition of the Deaf and Mute, sponsored by the China Association for the Deaf and Mute, opened at the Private Shangzhong School in Jing'an Temple on New Year's Day. From morning till night, there were many visitors. The exhibits were divided into three categories: first, works donated by famous calligraphers and painters; second, works from schools; and third, works by members and fellow sufferers. In total, there were approximately eight hundred items. My impressions are recorded below:

(1) The first room displayed works donated by famous calligraphers and painters, such as Li Jianzhi's running script musical instrument slip, Xie Gongzhan's flowers, Jiang Danshu's Clouds over Huangshan, Xie Xian'ou and Ding Xianghua's Amitabha, Wang Yachen's Fish Enjoying Themselves, Cheng Xiaoqing's plum blossoms, Zhang Daqi's Orioles in the Willow Shade, Chen Qiucao's landscapes, and Yu Jianhua's Listening to the Springs, all demonstrating skillful execution and not merely perfunctory works. Huang Jingwan contributed rubbings of the Han Xixia Song Stele, and He Gusheng donated Gao Ziqing's calligraphic copy of Zhu Zi's Family Precepts for fundraising.

(2) The second room displayed works from schools. Aside from simple items sent for display by the schools of Beiping, Yantai, and Liaoning, the Shanghai schools for the deaf and mute showed good results. One was from the Fuya School, including various charts, jade and stone seals, various decorative paintings, female students' embroidery, various lifestyle photographs taken by the students' photography club, and calligraphy, all being diligent works. It is proper to state that the school's vice-principal, Zai Jingyuan, has developed and invented a type of teaching manual chart based on more than ten years of teaching and research, combining the old-style Bell visible speech alphabet with the modern phonetic symbol pronunciation manual chart. He added scientific methods to simplify the complicated manual gestures. (The old manual gestures required five movements for one character; now only one or two hand gestures are needed for accurate pronunciation). Teaching by following the chart has been shown to be very effective. It has benefitted many deaf and mute people. The second was from the school for the deaf and mute attached to the China Association for the Deaf and Mute, including students' Chinese and Western paintings, metal and stone crafts, and embroidery. The results were excellent. This room displayed photographic portraits of Helen Keller, an American blind and deaf woman, communicating with others through touch. Seeing this, one understands the omnipotence of education, which is sufficient to promote the external world's belief in deaf and mute education and the fellow sufferers' interest in research. In this room were landscape scrolls by the deaf and mute Zhao Guangshun and Han Zhizhong, which were quite elaborate and detailed.

(3) The third room displayed works by members and fellow sufferers, such as Shi Yafu and Shen Shigao's landscapes, Gu Wuming and Wu Yiming's female figures, Huang Lizhuang, Zhang Jingyu, and Shi Zhihe's flowers, Zhu Qizhan and Wang Yachen's collaborative chickens and chrysanthemums, Wu Mo's calligraphy and paintings, Liu Kuizhong's flowers and birds, and He Jian and Ling Ziyun's calligraphy, all showing hard work and thus being extraordinary.

(4) The fourth room also displayed many works by members and fellow sufferers, including Wu Zhuyin's oil paintings, Wang Lingchuan's pastels, Zhang Zhongying's emerging pastels, as well as lacquer paintings, watercolors, patterns, advertisements, and other paintings. It is proper to state that member Cao Chinan exquisitely carved various match trademarks out of boxwood, his skills being divine. Feng Xun's commercial art designs and advertisements had sophisticated designs and beautiful color schemes. Dong Jinluo's dyed patterns took great care. Qian Zhigang's thirty cartoons, such as "The Night of the Tianjin Incident" and "People Fighting for a Dog," as well as various pictures depicting poetic intent, were deeply meaningful and worthy of contemplation.

It is heard that the association has closed on the 2nd and plans to select another location to continue the exhibition for several days. All the donated works of famous calligraphers and painters, with values ​​ranging from over twenty yuan to a dozen yuan, and ten yuan to eight yuan each, will be sold by lottery, with each item uniformly priced at five yuan.

### The New University Federation Seeks Member Schools

Since the fall of this city two years ago, new universities have emerged, and some have expanded their organizations. To date, there are sixteen schools, including Shanghai Women's University, Zhiyong University, Sanwu University, New China University, Danhua College, New China College, Chinese Medicine College, Chinese Medical College, New China Medical College, China Construction Engineering College, Jianhua Industrial School, Qianghua Industrial Vocational School, Minzhi Journalism Vocational School, Shanghai Guoxue Institute, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and Taiyan Literary Institute. Last year, Shanghai Women's University and others, with the aim of promoting research on emerging higher education, organized the New University Federation. Participants included Shanghai Women's University, New China University, Zhiyong University, New China College, Sanwu University, and Danhua College, among other six or seven schools. Jiang Zhuzhuang, Lu Xirong, Wu Zhiqian, Zhao Yiwei, Gu Sijiu, and Chen Xuhua were elected as directors. The Federation also held various activities such as Mandarin speech competitions. It is now heard that the Federation, in order to promote its activities, has decided to start soliciting member schools in the new year. All vocational schools and higher institutions in the city can apply to join. The correspondence address is Nanjing Liangjiang Superior Normal School of Shanghai Women's University, New Dagu Road. Thirty years ago, it was the highest institution of learning in the Southeast. During the Xinhai Revolution, it was completely destroyed. Supervisor Li Meian maintained it painstakingly but unsuccessfully. Therefore, he became angry and withdrew from the world, donning a yellow crown. The thousands of students from the East and West also scattered. This resolved to avoid the isolated island where soldiers would meet after the disaster. Zang Fogen and Li Zhongqian initiated a dinner gathering, publicly commemorating Master Mei, and discussed searching for and engraving Master Mei's posthumous works and alumni directory. It was held once last winter at Xiaoyoutian Restaurant, with fifty or sixty people attending. The day before yesterday, it was held again at Yijiachun. Teachers Zai Bingbo, Liu Mou, Xiao Wuquan, Yu Yudong, and Yao Meng also arrived one after another. It is heard that it will continue during the Lunar New Year. If there are old classmates who have not participated, they can write to Mr. Zang at No. 3 Ruby Lane, Hedde Road to register for communication purposes.

### Cunde Junior High School

Cunde Junior High School, founder and principal Xu Wenxiang, chairman of the board Ma Gongyu, this school has continued from primary school to establish a junior high school. The school building was self-built, and the foundation is solid. It is a well-established school in West Shanghai. The school name, Cunde, implies preserving morality and saving the world. The primary school was founded in August of the 18th year of the Republic of China on Route Paul Beau. Initially, there were only a dozen students. In the 20th year, Mr. Xu planned carefully and strove for construction. In January of the 21st year, a new school building was built, with eight rooms of various sizes. In July of the same year, the Municipal Bureau of Education approved its establishment. In the 25th year, a kindergarten was added, and it was decided to expand. There are now seventeen classrooms, four grades of senior students, a spring and autumn single-term system, and eight grades of junior students, all in a double-track single-term system. The number of students in primary school and kindergarten reaches one thousand two hundred and fifty. The junior high school campus is located at No. 149 Gubal Road.

Yesterday, the Jewish team defeated Russia 4-1, and Portugal also eliminated Germany 6-1. The Jewish and Portuguese teams will hold a rematch with the Scottish and Hualian teams.

Jewish Victory Over Russia

The match between the Jewish and Russian teams took place at 10:30 yesterday morning at Yishi Mao, with only about 400 spectators, mostly Jewish and Russian expatriates. Russia had outstanding players such as Roberts Stoff, Mike Dunn, Bolini, and Nicholas Leff, and their forwards were quite sharp. Although the Jewish team had no particularly outstanding individuals, the players were young and strong. The competition between the two sides was fierce, and the situation was extremely tense. Jewish player S. Greenberg dribbled deep and shot at the 18-yard mark, scoring the first goal. In the 28th minute, Bolinki lightly tried his foot, also scoring a goal. The Jewish team took a 2-0 lead. The Russian team actively counterattacked, and Capustin advanced from the left, pulling back a goal. In the first half, the Russian team trailed 1-2. As the second half began, the two sides remained evenly matched. In the 15th minute, Jewish defender Greenberg committed a foul and was penalized with a penalty kick. Roberts Stoff executed the kick, but the ball was saved by Sneizhong, who dove to the ground. The Jewish team survived a difficult situation and advanced with all its strength. Ten minutes before the end of the game, Jewish player Lee Foo passed to the edge of the goal, and S. Greenberg shot the ball into the net. In the last minute, Lee Foo kicked a corner, and the ball came at the goal. Seferlek panicked while saving the ball and accidentally hit it into the goal, giving away a point. The whistle blew, and the Jewish team defeated Russia 4-1.

Portuguese Victory Over Germany

The match between the Portuguese and German teams took place at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. The Portuguese team was the champion team of 1936-37 and also reached the finals in the previous tournament. Their strength was exceptionally strong. The German team's Newburg Pike was a famous French player, but the rest were mediocre, so the game was one-sided. After the start of the game, Portuguese center forward Rocha Lio scored two consecutive goals, and Fafan Xiao then scored, taking a 3-0 lead. At this time, the German team scored their first goal through center forward Newburg, but shortly after, Fafan Xiao scored another goal. Thus, the result of the first half was 4-2. After changing sides, the Portuguese team scored two more goals. In conclusion, the Portuguese team eliminated Germany 6-2.

In the New Six Cup Table Tennis Tournament, the match between Qingyun A and Youbang took place last night at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank's hall. Qingyun A has strong strength, but they were frustrated repeatedly because they underestimated their opponents previously.

The competition committee will select a date for a final match. Yesterday, Youbang's Chen Xian was wrongly placed, and the veteran Zhou Weixin was absent, so it was a pity that they lost.

### Difficult to Open the Gate of Charity

— Buddha

After a great philanthropist did a few things for public welfare, people asking for relief came one after another, some asking for money, some asking for food and clothing. Everyone hoped that the great philanthropist would "open his golden hand" and give them satisfactory gifts. As a result, the great philanthropist was unable to manage, so he had to close the gate and become a wealthy man who believed that "a good person is rich," which is indeed the case.

The gate of charity is indeed difficult to open. Once opened, it may not be easy to close. After all, there are many poor people in China, and there are few great philanthropists, so it is impossible to satisfy every "ragged" person. Even in European countries, it is no different. When Hitler of Germany was gearing up and preparing to seize the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, Mr. Zhang of England had a great sense of compassion and did not hesitate to humble himself and fly to Germany to do a great good deed, so that countless soldiers would not have to sacrifice themselves in the midst of fierce artillery fire. This kind of merit is truly unforgettable.

Now the territorial dispute between France and Italy is also at a difficult and inseparable juncture. The French authorities have clearly stated that they do not want Britain to mediate, fearing that Mr. Zhang will grind other people's heads into sauce again and do another charitable work. However, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini knows that Mr. Zhang is a man of great magnanimity and compassion, and is unwilling to let go easily. He is still trying his best to urge Mr. Zhang to convey Italy's various demands to France, because Mr. Zhang has already helped Germany to succeed in the past and will certainly not refuse to help Italy in the future.

Mr. Zhang has already become a great philanthropist, and I suppose he is unwilling to become a second great philanthropist, but since he has become the first great philanthropist, he cannot help but become the second great philanthropist. If he does not become the second great philanthropist, then the merits of the first great philanthropist will also be in vain. Mr. Mo has seen this point and will definitely say, "Big brother! We must ask you to come out and help us. Doing good deeds will bring good rewards." This is what it means to say that the gate of charity is difficult to open.

### A Poor Child Tries on New Clothes

— Simon

——A Quick Sketch of the Children's Welfare Association Distributing Winter Clothing for the New Year——

In this city of Shanghai, there have been many children these past few days, going to movie theaters and opera houses with their parents, returning with bundles of toys and candies. But on the other hand, there are countless homeless street children, shivering in the cold wind wearing thin and tattered clothes. The Shanghai office of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, dedicated to children's welfare, is distributing winter clothing during this New Year to provide these homeless street children with cotton-padded clothes to ward off the cold. They are distributing a total of six thousand sets in stages according to the district, starting on New Year's Day for four days. The first day was at the Shaoxing Native Association on Avenue Edward VII, the second day was at Guohua Middle School on Gordon Road, the third day was at the Zhabei Poor Children's Education and Care Center in Wangjiazhai, and the fourth day was at the Cixie Education and Care Center on Route Lafayette.

Because Guohua Middle School is very close to my residence, I took some time on the morning of the 2nd to see the distribution of winter clothing. The stipulated time was from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. When I arrived at Guohua Middle School, it was not yet ten o'clock, but a large crowd of miserable children had already gathered at the entrance, boys and girls, ranging from six or seven to thirteen or fourteen years old. Each one was disheveled and dirty, wearing tattered clothes that no longer provided warmth. The younger ones, from a few months to two or three years old, were brought by adults. Cold clothing vouchers had been distributed in advance, so everyone held a green voucher in their hands. Then the staff told them to swarm into the iron gate, but those without cold clothing vouchers, or only adults without children, were not allowed to enter.

The corridor in front of the classrooms of Guohua Middle School was piled high with stacks of winter clothing, almost touching the roof. The playground was cordoned off with desks and ropes to create walkways for entering and exiting. The children were arranged in an orderly line, first come, first served, no pushing. Each male and female staff member wore a cloth number on their sleeve, numbering twenty or thirty people, so the order was maintained quite well. Those who arrived first went in, and more and more continued to arrive. The outer wall of Guohua Middle School was not high, so by standing on tiptoe, one could see the distribution of winter clothing from the outside. Therefore, the low wall along Gordon Road was also filled with people, but the heartless police officers constantly came to disperse them.

At a quarter past ten, the distribution began. Under the guidance of the staff, the miserable children walked onto the platform. After checking the vouchers, each person was given a set of cotton-padded clothes. There were four sizes, distributed according to the size of the children. The process was very fast; in less than an hour, almost several hundred sets of winter clothing had been distributed. Then the adults and children who received the clothes lined up again and exited Guohua Middle School in an orderly fashion. Each person carried a set of new winter clothing, with black cloth on the outside and white cloth on the inside, and the cotton was quite thick. Everyone was happy and jumping for joy. They walked out of Guohua Middle School, and some couldn't wait to put it on and try it out, to see if the size fit. Several adults waiting outside were very happy to see their children receive new clothes. Perhaps these children had never worn such new clothes in their entire lives! We must thank the efforts of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, but we hope that all sectors can continue to contribute funds to allow these little lives to get through this severe winter.

Film Review

### The Pearl Shirt

— Ruhua

Produced by Huaxin Film Company, Showing at Xin Guang Theater

Warner Oland's "Charlie Chan Detective Cases" had been listed in Twentieth Century's production plan as a "must-produce" item, with several films being made every year. Unfortunately, this "cash cow" passed away last year due to heart disease. After Warner Oland's death, the "Charlie Chan Detective Cases" naturally could not continue to be produced, but very quickly, Twentieth Century created a "Great Detective Moto" and still used the Chinese star Lu Xiqi, who played Charlie Chan's son, as an assistant. This "Great Detective Moto" is played by Peter Lorre, who starred in the horror film "M," and his "Moto" naturally created a new style. However, recent news has spread that Twentieth Century has found a new person whose appearance is quite similar to Warner Oland. It seems that Twentieth Century has not given up on its plan to produce "Charlie Chan Detective Cases."

Huaxin Company's production of "The Pearl Shirt" is probably also motivated by Xu Xinyuan's close resemblance to Warner Oland. Indeed, Xu Xinyuan's facial contours, figure, and demeanor, as seen on the screen, can be said to be exactly the same as Warner Oland.

The screenwriter and director of "The Pearl Shirt" is Xu Xinfu, who previously wrote and directed detective films such as "Emerald Horse" and "Lively Dragon and Tiger." Based on his past experience, this Chinese Great Detective Charlie Chan's first amazing detective case upon returning to China, "The Pearl Shirt," shows several significant improvements. First, he infused scientific knowledge into this detective case. For example, Charlie Chan deliberately allowed the robbers to steal a batch of jewelry worth 20,000 yuan in a tea room, but installed a generator in the jewelry box. When the generator generated electricity, the direction of the robbers' den could be measured in a specially made radio box. After Charlie Chan was arrested, he used a miniature generator to call for help, etc., so that the general audience unintentionally received a scientific education while being entertained, which truly fulfilled the principle that film is an educational tool. However, due to the sudden stoppage of current in a radio repair tool and the sudden interruption of the sound of the radio, the true culprit was discovered. We have considerable doubts about this "precious" "lightning rod."

Similarly, the directorial techniques are also more advanced. For example, at the beginning, when the ancient tomb map of the Zhao mansion was stolen, he first wrote about Zhao Xiaofan's nephew returning late at night, acting furtively, and the car driver flirting with the maidservant's secretive actions, and then wrote about the safe being stolen. This "smoke screen" is arranged very cleverly. When Charlie Chan returned to China to take over the case, the pearl shirt was stolen a day earlier, followed by several clues that were closely related to the pearl shirt, such as Xu Desheng's murder and Honest's murder, which obscured the past amidst the continuous occurrence of murder cases. This is much better than past works, where you knew who the murderer was from the very beginning.

However, there are also flaws here. For example, after the ancient tomb was stolen, this well-organized gang of thieves would never immediately sell the jade artifacts to antique dealers. Although when Old Dong was killed, Little Yang added a sentence, "Taught you to go to foreign merchants, why sell to Jumaozhai?" (general idea). However, this is still not enough. A theft organization like this would not let others handle the disposal of the stolen goods. Also, Hu Lie is the only capable person in the gang who can see the "boss," and he should be a very alert person, but he confusedly gave the stolen jade bracelet to Miss Bai. These two points, I think, are the biggest loopholes.

In my personal opinion, Xu Xinyuan's Charlie Chan does not need to completely imitate Warner Oland's slow movements (which are foreign assumptions about Chinese movements). He might as well be more alert and agile.

### Our Life

— Xu You

We originally lived an inhuman life. Since the "August 13th" Incident, our lives have become more and more panicked, and more and more difficult. Before "August 13th," we only had to work seven or eight hours a day and could earn forty or fifty cents. Now, we work ten or more hours a day, but only earn twenty-something cents.

Because our income is so meager, our life is truly beyond my ability to describe. It's really terribly bad! Now, let me briefly report our daily life to the readers!

Accommodation

We live mostly in three-tiered and two-tiered shacks. The air is extremely foul. At least a dozen people sleep in one room. Beds are arranged horizontally and vertically. We don't even have proper beds; we just spread something on the floor. If it's a hot summer, mosquitoes and bedbugs will use us as their food. So, we suffer from more diseases than ordinary people.

Food and Drink

Usually, we have porridge twice a day, morning and evening. At noon, we eat a bowl of dry rice. Some are even more frugal and only eat two meals, one around 10 AM and another around 5 PM. Side dishes are all tofu, bean sprouts, pickled vegetables, dried radish, etc. We have never tasted fish or meat. When we work the night shift, the factory gives us each six copper coins to buy a pancake to eat in the middle of the night. Although we bite into two pancakes during this entire twelve-hour night shift, how can they satisfy the hunger in our stomachs!

Clothing

Since we can barely sustain our lives, of course, we wouldn't dream of having any beautiful clothes. We don't even have basic, crude clothes. When winter comes, our clothing is especially difficult. However, those poor young sisters-in-law, seeing other people's socks and handkerchiefs, would rather go hungry and save a few copper coins to buy those handkerchiefs and socks. This is a world of difference from those ladies and young concubines who wear socks costing ten or more yuan a pair.

Work

We get up from our hard boards at four o'clock in the morning, dragging our heavy steps towards the man-eating factory, to continue doing that mechanical work. We work from 5 AM to 7 PM, more than fourteen hours a day. During work, if we talk or play for a while, the foreman's whip will fall on our heads. It can be said that we live a disguised prison life every day!

The above is just a general description of our daily life. Ah! We are now simply like birds trapped in a cage! All freedom and happiness have been deprived from us by life! Depression and resentment are constantly burning in my heart. However, I know that these things only happen in an unreasonable social system. Therefore, we are not only not pessimistic, but we constantly fight against evil forces! Although we have to endure a little now due to living problems, we will never succumb to evil forces.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

Chapter 1: The One-Armed Old Man Organizes a Free Village, the Twin Daughters Respectfully Visit the Martyrs' Tomb

This country schoolteacher's surname was Zhu, and his given name was Gengen. Country people don't have grand names or style names; Gengen is just Gengen, the name and style are the same. However, acquaintances in the countryside all call him Lao Yuan. Zhu Lao Yuan was well-known in that town because he was considered a sensible and decisive person in the town. If there were any problems that the whole village couldn't solve, they would all ask Zhu Lao Yuan. Any difficult matter was often handled clearly by Zhu Lao Yuan's ideas. This is also why the whole village respected him so much. That's why he could do it. In the years of the Republic of China, 23 and 24, there were several places in China that trained recruits. This news spread to the village. Other villages didn't understand the meaning of training recruits, but when it reached Zhu Lao Yuan's village, many strong young men became excited. This was not without Zhu Lao Yuan's credit, because he often told a group of people in ordinary days. Now our Chinese future is so dangerous: how terrible foreigners are; how painful it is to lose our country. He also told them that China has always been known as a weak country. The reason why it is called a weak country is that the people do not have a strong will and do not have a trained body. Therefore, they cannot resist strong enemies. This remark of his made the village youths want to try it. Originally, those village youths were mostly his students, and the students naturally listened to what the teacher said. Those rural youths usually played with guns and sticks, lifted thousand-pound stones, and practiced Shaolin boxing. They were extremely happy. When recruit training came to the village, the youths were very enthusiastic and everyone scrambled to sign up. Country people originally got up early, but now, when it wasn't even dawn, they got up for morning exercises. Not only many youths in the village, but Zhu Lao Yuan himself also acted as a guide in it. At that time, an army sent a military officer to teach them. This officer had a good knowledge of military affairs. In addition to teaching them how to practice, there were often sermons. Dao's sermon was not very serious, but was a kind of persuasive and encouraging, so that the rural children were very happy to hear. That officer knew that Zhu Lao Yuan was the model for the whole village, so he promoted him to the captain, and of course Zhu Lao Yuan became even more enthusiastic. At this time, the village seemed to be armed. Although the uniform was only worth two yuan and five jiao, the rural youths wore them, went home after morning exercises, walked on the banks of the field, straightened their bodies, and straightened their waists, how majestic!

### The Prelude to 1939: A Post-War Greeting from Cantonese Opera Performers; The Renewal Stage Meeting on the Seventh Day of This Month

— Shugang

The prelude to 1939 has already been opened. The first major event in the theatrical world, I think in these short few days, is the crucial meeting of Dongxi's stars in Shanghai after the war to make a first decision on the appearance of Cantonese people in Shanghai. The arrival of Cantonese opera in Shanghai was very ordinary before the war, but it was quite difficult after the war. If there are no special performances, they will not come easily. In the autumn of last year, Hong Kong Cantonese opera artists once resolved to not go to other places temporarily, because they absolutely refused to cooperate with others. I dare say that this decision is worth cherishing, not like ordinary dramas.

In addition to Wenwusheng (leading male role in Cantonese opera) Gui Mingyang, there is also a comet in Cantonese opera, Luo Jiaquan, who is the leader of the four great clowns. In the minds of Cantonese people, there may be those who do not know Xue Juexian, but there is no one who does not know Luo Jiaquan. The decision is that Xiaowusheng (young male martial role) Liang Yintang and Xin Zhu are both emerging roles with artistry. On the Kun (female) side, of course everyone knows Tan Yulan and Tang Xueqian, but these figures are not easily performed anymore, and the giant wheels of the times are constantly moving forward; Wen Huamei, Zi Lan Nu, and Hua Lisi, who have inherited them, are all beautiful Kun roles with superb artistry. I think people of the new era should of course have a good impression of the roles of the new era.

This group of Cantonese opera performers, with full of hot expectations, is coming to Shanghai soon. Yesterday, Xiang Sheng Company, which is in charge of Cantonese opera affairs, has received a telegram. This afternoon at 2 o'clock, taking the sea of ​​Changxing Company, they are riding the waves, and the Cantonese compatriots in Shanghai have prepared a grand welcome. The date of their debut on the stage is probably in the evening of the seventh of this month.

The entire Shanghai people are immersed in an atmosphere of enjoyment. Shouldn't I be spoiling the fun by reporting this piece of news today? (Lai Chen)

### New Year's and Entertainment (Continued to the End)

— Xitong

The New Year's and Yuan Ridge amusements of the Yuan and Ming Dynasties can be found in volumes 1, 4, 8, 9, 11, and 13 of "Yongxi Yuefu," such as "Lantern Festival," "Lantern Poetry," "Lantern Night," and "Yunnight." There are about 20 suites in total. Due to space limitations, I cannot list them in detail. In short, those are good materials for studying acrobatics (i.e., various miscellaneous performances), which can be read together with Zhang Heng's "Western Capital Rhapsody" and Li Yun's "Pingleguan Rhapsody." Let me give a few examples: Jia Zhongming's Lantern Poetry says: "Qiao Sanjiao is happy to move music, and Drunken Eight Immortals quickly stumble high on stilts." Cao Mengxiu's Lantern Night says: "See, see, see the puppet children come together, each holding treasures in their hands, out, out, out, circling around several times... Yes, yes, yes, the Yuanben (early form of Chinese drama) does a section on Qiao Teaching, He, he, he, dance together to the music of the village fields." An anonymous person's Yuan Night says: "The peddler comes to sell on credit, and the children play with bamboo horses." An anonymous person's Lantern Poetry says: "The funny Yuanben is really pretty, and Bao Lao dances on one side." As shown above, it can be seen that the fifteenth day of the first month of the Yuan and Ming Dynasties was not much different from the Song Dynasty.

The New Year's Day of the Qing Dynasty can be exemplified by the archives of the Shengping Department. Zhou Mingtai's "Random Copy of Examples from the Shengping Department Archives" puts all the performances on New Year's Day together. The Yi cavity often performed in the Qing Palace included Jingde Fishing, etc. (only in the third year of Daoguang; it was gone in the fourth year). The Yue Ling Chengying Opera included "Receiving Many Blessings," "Myriad Blessings United," "Opening a Feast to Celebrate," and "Humorous Festival Greetings," which were mostly boring plays that were auspicious (published by the Ancient Palace Museum). Kunqu Opera included Sweeping Flowers, Three Drunkennesses, Qiao Vinegar, Shanmen, and Visiting Su, which are recorded in the Enshang Diary Archives from the third year of Daoguang to the third year of Tongzhi. However, in the Enshang Diary Archives of the fifth year of Tongzhi, Ping Opera Green Stone Mountain, Jinshui Bridge, Zhao Family Building, Visiting Relatives, and Blocking Liang were added, which shows the transition from Yi cavity through Kun cavity to Luan Tan.

The significance of modern entertainment, for example, this year, may lie in rejoicing in the unified national spirit of the all-out war of resistance and Chairman Chiang's determination to resist to the end. In that case, Jin Suqin's "Liang Hongyu," Chen Yunshang's "Mulan Joins the Army," Zhou Xinfang and Wang Xichun's "Fragrant Concubine's Hatred," the Xianni Society's "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty," Zai Yunfeng's "Golden Spear Story," Xu Jixiang, Jiang Yifei, Zhang Hongsheng, and Xia Zhifei's "Biography of Heroes," Li Hanchen's "Yue Biography"...and so on, should be more meaningful, right?

Although it is said to be New Year's entertainment, it seems to have told a concrete and miniature history of drama. This is a little intention of my writing.

### Embellishing the Silent New Year: A Record of the Silk and Cloth Society's Celebration

— Shu Wu

The Silk and Cloth Society is an abbreviation for the Silk and Cotton Cloth Industry Knowledge-Seeking Mutual Aid Society. It was established last autumn by colleagues in the silk and cotton cloth industry, with the aim of "using spare time to connect feelings, study real skills, and exchange various knowledge." The society was originally located in the Xindaxiang Building. Because of the development of the society and the expansion of its members, the original location was not enough, so it recently moved to the second floor of 260 Tianjin Road. When the New Year came in joyous cheers, the Silk and Cloth Society was also full of new vitality.

The Silk and Cloth Society was established to seek the welfare of all colleagues in the industry, so their facilities were also made according to this goal. In addition to establishing a library, setting up a cram school, and publishing the Silk and Cloth Monthly, they also hold various noble entertainments to enable colleagues to change their past corrupt lives in their spare time. The entertainment that the Silk and Cloth Society has already organized includes table tennis, harmonica, chess, singing, silk and bamboo instruments, Ping opera, and drama, etc. This joint celebration is also a manifestation of the results of their usual practice.

I stepped into the Silk and Cloth Society, and the clock had just struck seven. The guests were crammed into all the seats. To the sound of the harmonium and erhu accompaniment, the curtain gradually opened. First was the chairman's report, followed by the "Recruitment Team Formation." In advance, the executive committee elected more than 20 team leaders from among the members. Using a competition method, each person was asked to do their best to introduce new members, hoping to expand the original two hundred or so members to more than double that number. After introducing each team leader individually, it was the first drama of the Liaison Theater Company - "A Glass of Milk." The meaning of the whole play is to describe a hypocritical so-called "philanthropist" who only knows how to fish for fame. The real charity is placed in front of him, but he doesn't do it. A comedy full of laughter directly exposes the true face of a part of hypocrites! After that, there was singing, with male and female parts singing together, singing "New Life Movement," "Manjianghong," "On the Jialing River," and "Brightness." Finally, due to the request of the guests, they added another "Boatman's Song in Ambush." Whether in terms of melody or coordination, they have already reached the point of purity. The free singing of the members was not so good. But their enthusiasm is commendable!

The second Liaison Society's song was "Christmas Flower" by a pair of young men and women. Because the lyrics were funny, everyone laughed, and even the singers laughed. Mu suddenly closed, and only after the unanimous request of the guests did it continue to sing, earning loud applause and unstoppable laughter!

Before the final drama "Dawn" opened, there was another report from the chairman, preparing for a bigger celebration during the lunar new year. We are eagerly awaiting "Dawn" is also a one-act play, which seems to be the most surprising program of the celebration. In terms of performance, the actors have done their best, and everyone is very good. However, the meaning of the play is not clear enough, and it is not as spicy and flavorful as "A Glass of Milk." After the whole play is over, the audience still cannot grasp its main idea. Moreover, the hints behind the scenes were so loud that even the audience heard them, which should be absolutely avoided! Generally speaking, it was a rare achievement to have such a result after only hurried preparations. I think there will be better performances at the second celebration of the Lunar New Year, so let's look forward to it!

Announcement

The increase of the Weiqi (Go) Academy in the entertainment world has been described in a small notice yesterday, and I would like to clarify something further: The art of Weiqi is infinitely changing, and there is no end to perfection. Even a national player dare not be proud of his art. This academy is edited by Mr. Bao Zibo, and only seeks to have a dedicated person in charge. It is not to say that Mr. Bao's art is unsurpassed. And Mr. Bao certainly has no such intention. Moreover, this academy is purely for entertainment purposes and cannot be compared with competing for fame. There must be many masters among the readers of this newspaper, but I am sorry that I cannot visit and ask for advice one by one. I hope you will not hesitate to contribute your pearls and jade and share your experiences to benefit your fellow enthusiasts and increase the glory of this academy. You are welcome to do so.

### Secret Stories of the Old Capital's Imperial Palace and Opera World (6)(4)

— Xu Muyun

Yu Shuyan Visited More Than Ten Famous Teachers

Qian Jinfu sang martial roles. Because he wore padded clothing inside, he raised his shoulders very high. As for Li Keyong in "Zhu Lian Zhai," since he had returned to playing the student role, he could only follow the rules for playing older male roles, raising his shoulders halfway. Halfway meant raising both shoulders slightly, making them form an oval shape, a very simple posture. Because Shuyan was assisted by Jinfu, he always raised his shoulders too high. Later, although someone told him to change it, it was very difficult to change a deeply ingrained habit. The body movements in "Wen Qiao" and "Tian Lei Bao" indeed relied heavily on Wang Shuanzi. The mannerisms in the study of "Nao Fu" were taught by Jinfu. For this complete version of "Qiong Lin Yan," having Qian and Wang as supporting actors would undoubtedly make Shushi's performance outstanding. Now that those veteran actors are all dead, it's no wonder Shuyan no longer performs it. In addition, Cheng Jixian and Bao Jixiang also had a relationship with Shuyan that was half teacher and half friend. Because he admired people like Qiu Guixian who could both sing and play instruments, he also learned the huqin diligently from veteran Yan Heng and others. Previously, his qin player, Li Peixiang, was a renowned player he trained. His versatility and the number of famous teachers he sought out are probably unmatched by anyone else in the profession today.

The Secret to Eavesdropping on Yu Shuyan Warming Up His Voice

Shuyan, who used to be called Little Yu, is now in his fifties and has become the leading figure in the world of older male roles, with the demeanor of the late King Tan. The ancient Chinese philosophers spoke of working at sunrise and resting at sunset, but Shuyan did the opposite. He "sleeps at dawn" every day and only slowly gets up when the electric lights come on. After having a late dinner (which would be considered an early breakfast according to American time) and smoking enough, it's almost twelve o'clock. When everyone else is asleep, you can see a thin qin player named Zhu Jia carrying a huqin, listlessly entering Yu's residence in Chunshu Second Alley. At this time, Shuyan is in high spirits, full of energy. Regular friends like Zhang Boju, Li Shike, and Le Yuanke have all opened their talk boxes (not listening to records, but these people talking endlessly), telling jokes, discussing opera, or making fun of amateur performers or other veteran male actors. Shuyan is a very sharp conversationalist, sometimes using witty remarks to tease people, which is truly very humorous.

### Starting with Goya

— Douqin

Because Japanese "first-class writer" Sato Haruo, after visiting Shanghai, said that Zhabei looked like a painting by Goya, I began to think about some current issues in painting.

In reality, if there were a writer like Goya today, it would be very necessary. Let's not even mention his famous works like "The Disasters of War," but just his exhaustive attitude alone. If he were alive today, his works would definitely have a huge impact. But that impact, needless to say, is not the unique taste that Sato Haruo seeks.

We can frankly say that there has never been a writer like this in China. Chinese genre paintings are often just simple historical paintings, and even the highest achievements can only barely be compared to the French Rococo painter Watteau. But this is only a bare comparison. However, at the end of the Qing dynasty, a great painter appeared, and that was Wu Jiayou, known as Youru.

This painter's name has long been forgotten. Recently, someone talked about "Shanghai Anecdotes," and he was mentioned incidentally. This is appropriate. Wu Youru's contributions, generally speaking, are twofold: first, he created genuine genre paintings; second, he created large-scale serial illustrations. Both of these were unprecedented in Chinese painting history. He not only closely linked painting with current events but also used paintings as weapons against foreign aggression. I don't have "Dianshizhai Pictorial" and "Feiyingge Pictorial" at hand, but I remember that his works, in addition to depictions of the Sino-French War, which was a major event at the time, also included protests against the concession courts. Of course, he never directly opposed the Qing government, and sometimes even praised it. Moreover, his realistic techniques were sometimes naive. However, all of these should be attributed to his environment and his era.

In recent studies of Chinese painting (such as Mr. Yu Jianhua's "A History of Chinese Painting"), there is almost no mention of Wu Youru's name. However, everyone prefers to remember Qian Huian, a painter who was Wu Youru's contemporary, also lived in Shanghai, and was also famous for painting figures. The reason is that Qian is refined, and Wu is common. Naturally, according to the theory of Chinese painting, Qian is qualified. But what did Qian paint? Just some ladies and gentlemen who had absolutely nothing to do with his surroundings (which is fundamentally different from Wu's historical paintings). Refinement is naturally good, but I think the most thorough refinement is the landscapes of Da Mi; using the brush to arbitrarily dot them is completely free of "craftsmanship," but its use is inexplicable.

I am not saying that current painters must learn from Wu Youru; I am just saying that a writer like Wu Youru is still needed today. His attitude, his plan, his subject matter, current writers all need to pay attention to. If there were a writer today who could run a pictorial like Wu Youru, I think it would still be useful. Naturally, true news now has photography, but like Wu Youru, extracting the essence of current events, painting the real characters of pursuit and satire, and even adding a popular explanation at the end of the painting like Wu Youru, would still be extremely meaningful. As for the technique being more advanced, being more fused with new techniques, that goes without saying.

There are still art schools in Shanghai, but I have no idea what the curriculum is like. However, judging from the usual "artistic style," it is naturally impossible to go to the suburbs to sketch from life now, but I guess they are still lighting fires in the painting studio, drawing models of Liang Kai, and copying Raphael's Madonna paintings. Naturally, no one can say that basic courses should not be learned. However, at present, since there is time to use Western masterpieces to temper art, it would be much more useful to copy works like Goya than to copy Raphael. Also, I think it's not wrong to learn from works by Daumier, Toulouse-Lautrec, and others. These are just two painters that I casually thought of. That kind of art is naturally not enough for current applications, but if that method were developed, it could at least expose the corruption in a certain part of this island, at least vividly outline the original form of the traitors. However, these two painters are also considered painters with "craftsmanship" in the West, and their names are often missing from art history.

### Night March

— Donghao

Night, boundless darkness.

No moon, no stars, only the cold light of bayonets shimmering in the darkness. Brothers gathered from all directions formed a steel-like team, passing through jungles, through desolate villages, and advancing toward the vast wilderness.

The surroundings were deathly silent; but in the heart of every warrior, it was as if ten thousand horses were galloping. Rapid footsteps, trampling on the muddy road scattered with gravel, made a "rustling" sound, as if encouraging the courage of thousands of warriors.

Climbing around the foot of a mountain, there was a dark and lush clump of reeds. The path was too narrow, and the reed leaves on both sides kissed the faces of the warriors one by one. A cold wind swept through, making a rustling sound, and the thick clouds in the sky also rushed forward rapidly. Small voices often came from within the team—everyone was discussing the extraordinary encounter that was about to come.

A civilian porter carrying bullets, panting and sweating profusely, was told softly by the captain:

"You're tired, take a break!"

"No, it doesn't matter. I can go back after I deliver the bullets to the generals across the railway."

Although it was just a short conversation, it fully demonstrated the spirit of cooperation between the military and the people.

The time had passed midnight, and the main railway was not far away. Because the captain had issued an order: "When crossing the railway, walk on the sacks laid on the railway. Maybe the enemy will electrify the railway."

After groping in the dark for a while, the front suddenly stopped. The team stirred. Everyone's heart beat suddenly intensified; the rifles on their shoulders were also taken down in preparation for firing.

"Report to the captain: no enemies found ahead!" A rapid and sharp voice broke the silent air. Suddenly, the "rustling" footsteps started again, and the tense mood relaxed. Many people were coughing, talking softly, and laughing. The captain issued another order: "No noise, walk lightly, prepare to cross the railway!"

Tension, excitement, curiosity… all kinds of inexplicable emotions occupied the hearts of everyone. Hot blood was boiling, making people forget the night cold that was attacking from all sides. Hands, pressed on the triggers, ready to deal with the sparks fired by the enemy.

Here! Two beams of white light lying on the ground were already visible. The officers stood by the road, waiting for the passage of the team. Everyone, like discovering a treasure, walked across this railway line, which the enemy regarded as their lifeline, with a pleasant and relaxed pace.

Maybe the enemy is hiding in the camp, dreaming of home! Very smoothly, the team passed the railway safely. But everyone seemed a little disappointed, looking back at the winding rails, murmuring: "Didn't even see half a leg of a ghost!"

### New Year's First Writing

— Wang Fen

A year bearing the heavy burden of life has quietly slipped away; chewing on the sorrow and joy that this year has left me, my heart is filled with an unspeakable taste. In my short life history, that year's life indeed left an indelible mark. However, joy or sorrow, apart from the imprint deeply engraved on the heart membrane, everything slipped away like smoke. A brand-new calendar hangs in front of my desk, and the clear writing tells me: this is the beginning of another year. What will these future days bring me? I can't help but feel lost again! However, the life of exile over the past year has tempered me quite a bit, making me quite resilient and strong; I can endure hardship and bear sorrow. Even if these days arranged before me are perhaps a hundred times more difficult than the past year, I also believe that I can get through them.

When I leisurely picked up my pen in the New Year of the year before last, I never even dreamed that the next New Year would drift to distant Hunan; just as last year's New Year, when I was walking in the snow in Xiangxiang, I never thought that this year's New Year would come to this prosperous and peaceful isolated island. Similarly, as I spend the New Year at this moment, who can say for sure where I will be today next year? Everything is unknowable, everything is dreamlike and fleeting, time is deceiving people, and fate is also teasing me. But isn't the meaning of life precisely in this kind of dreamlike fleetingness? I don't regard drifting as a bitter thing (there are said to be many people in the world who drift for life!), on the contrary, I think that drifting life, even exiled life, is also quite meaningful. Just say today last year, we were walking in the snow in that small county town; the north wind howled, scraping the accumulated snow piled on the mountain into the air, dancing around like butterflies for a while, and then falling down again; we were not afraid of the cold, holding onto the edges of our hats, trudging through the snow, watching the footprints left on the silver-like mountain, as if seeing our immortal career, left in the world. That kind of joy is indescribable for a moment! When we returned from the mountain, we drank some good wine, slowly drinking by the charcoal brazier, letting silence occupy this cold space, reminiscing about the shattered dreams of our homeland; listening to the children all over the street, running and shouting in the snow, setting off firecrackers, singing out-of-tune military songs, the sweet fantasy was shattered, a little tipsy on both cheeks, two lines of tears, but the heart was happy, because there seemed to be a bright lamp in front, illuminating my arduous journey. I like a life of constant change, drifting and exile are the most meaningful!

But now I am spending the New Year here. Joy and licentiousness adorn this difficult New Year. Who would have thought that on the other side of the country, a vast war is raging? Bleeding, death, running away, wandering, dominate most of China, while here, jazz overwhelms the groans of the victims, and erotic revelry almost swallows the ambitions of many young people. Is it a scene of peace and prosperity? Robbery, starvation, and killing, those are daily occurrences; it's good that there are no such spoilsport incidents before the New Year's feast; the isolated island's New Year, after all, arrives in joy.

The year placed before me is a mysterious puzzle to me. With a feeling of surprise mixed with anxiety, I will arrange these days well. But who can predict? This coming year? Listening to the sounds of the city all over the street, I feel lost again!

### Dog Beating

— Mali

There are several grades of dogs: there are the tail-wagging, begging lapdogs, the mange dogs covered in stench, the vicious dogs barking indiscriminately, the mad dogs with poisonous fangs that hurt people; there are also some dogs that recognize thieves as fathers and ghosts as masters; and even some dogs that speak human language and pretend to be human but secretly exhibit dog-like behavior and do dog-like things. We have no name for these two kinds of dogs, so we call them yin-yang dogs, vicious dogs.

We humans must not indulge these dogs, nor can we be careless; otherwise, they will jump and steal food, bark and bite indiscriminately, not only making people uneasy but also causing people harm. If they form gangs and turn the human world into a dog world, that would be even more unthinkable!

Therefore, we humans must rise up and beat the dogs. Beat them with all our might: drive them out of the door, knock them into the water, and still not relax, but continue to beat them harder: beat them to death, beat them to a minimum, beat them all to death, beat them all to extinction; only when there is no trace of dog breath in our human world, will we stop!

Especially in this period of beating ghosts, everyone must be more careful to guard against dogs and bravely beat dogs. Beat to death those running dogs that help ghosts harm people, beat to extinction those thieving dogs that cause trouble from behind, only then can we destroy the ghosts' magic power, only then can we strengthen our human camp, and beat the ghosts to a state of falling flowers and flowing water!

Pay attention: dogs that befriend ghosts must be beaten, and dogs that are mixed among people must also be beaten; and be careful that those dogs that go out will turn their heads and show their teeth and claws, and those dogs that fall into the water will jump ashore and bite back, so we cannot but continue to fight desperately; at the same time, we must also be careful of those dogs that wear human clothes but are actually dog-toned and dog-like, will create opportunities and erupt with dog nature, and we must immediately watch them, lock them up, tie them up, and even take advantage of the convenience to beat them to death in silence!

Beating dogs is an important task in beating ghosts, everyone must not underestimate it. We humans, quickly pick up sticks and beat the ghosts while beating the dogs!

### Ode to Scorched Earth

— Yiren

I sing the praises of scorched earth, I sing the praises of scorched earth.

The pendulum's tick-tock shattered the tranquility of midnight, striking my memory one by one.

In my memory, a blaze of fire, a cloud of black smoke, half the sky dyed red.

This fire, this darkness, spread, went mad; the tongues of fire licked the entire earth.

Everything was destroyed, everything was destroyed!

But, no tears, no sighs. A sigh, a drop, those are the symbols of the weak. Ah, we are iron infants forged in the crucible!

New life sprouted in the rubble, a free nation was built on this ruin!

And this fire will scorch dry the demons' blood; this black smoke will suffocate the demons' breath; this scorched earth will bury the demons' lives.

Scorched earth is the demons' tomb!

Forever, forever, our motherland will be built on scorched earth!

In my dreams, I also sing the praises of scorched earth!

Scorched earth! I sing the praises of you.
