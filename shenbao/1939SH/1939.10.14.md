Editorial

### The Actions of the Soviet Union

Winston Churchill of England once said in December of last year that "The Soviet Union is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma." While this criticism did not answer questions about the Soviet Union, it did point out that the Soviet Union itself is a question. The internal progress of the Soviet Union is something we understand; its external expansion is also something we have witnessed; but its various contradictions can only be explained by those who are either too harsh or too loyal. Of course, these two interpretations are diametrically opposed. Recently, it suddenly closed its consulates in Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin in China; some say that this indicates that Soviet-Japanese relations have become tense and deteriorated again; but we have no information to explain or judge this. In Europe, it has successively signed new treaties with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which everyone has experienced: but who can know whether its negotiations with Finland are to promote friendship or to provoke war? The harsh say that it is an evil demon of aggression; the loyal say that it is the ancestor of benevolent rule!

When we discuss the Soviet Union, or even anything, anyone, or any country, we fundamentally do not like to equivocate or be ambiguous; but we are driven by our conscience not to love what we love, say what we say, or be dogmatic; we must have evidence to be fair and just. There is too little evidence to judge everything about the Soviet Union. It provides evidence, and it is not stingy, and it is vivid and vigorous, like a raging fire; unfortunately, each piece of evidence is only a fragment, and the fragments are not connected to each other and are contradictory. How can we lightly judge many contradictory fragments? For example, before August 20, who could judge what the Soviet Union was thinking in its talks with Britain and France, or where it was heading? And after the signing of the Soviet-German trade and credit agreement was announced on August 20, who could judge that there would be a non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany with revolutionary implications? By September 1, Germany had opened fire on Poland; the world only saw the Soviet Union signing a cessation of hostilities agreement with Japan in the east and concentrating troops on the border in the west; who did not expect it to give the aggressor countries a practical lesson based on its own definition of aggression; who could judge that the Soviet Union would actually help Germany accelerate the outcome of Poland's national destiny and help Germany accelerate the end of the Eastern Front? After helping Germany and destroying Poland, it declared neutrality to Britain and the 24 countries including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland! After declaring neutrality, it demanded islands, harbors, and land-based strategic points from the countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania! This is something that no one could have judged in advance. It is in negotiations with Finland; who can predict what the outcome of the negotiations will be, who is being dogmatic! Before the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, it signed a kind and benevolent treaty with Lithuania, granting the country land, mutual assistance, guarantees, and respecting the country's national organization, military facilities, economic and social system, and not interfering in its internal affairs; the Soviet Union only had the right to station troops in certain places within Lithuania. From the last day of the Soviet Union's negotiations with Britain and France in Moscow on the tripartite mutual assistance agreement and discussing tripartite military cooperation to this day, it has only been fifty-odd days, and the situation and appearance of the process are most like a complex, chaotic, broken, and intermittent dream!

We have absolutely no preconceived notions of love or hate towards the Soviet Union; but we sincerely hope that it will eventually become a force for stabilizing the international order and upholding justice. Although the Soviet Union's performance in the last five decades has made even the fairest people feel bewildered, it is indeed still different from the countries of militaristic aggression. As for what role the Soviet Union will play on the international stage in the future, we have neither the evidence to judge it, nor does the Soviet Union have a frank and clear expression, it is still, as Churchill said, "a riddle": a more informative reference is the editorial in the Moscow News on the 11th of this month. The Moscow News is the Soviet Union's mouthpiece to the outside world, and its explanation of the Soviet-Lithuanian treaty can also be seen as an explanation of Soviet policy; it said that this treaty is "a practical proof of a socialist country guaranteeing the independence of small countries," with "restoring justice" as the motivation, it is "a righteous act of returning the land of other countries that has been invaded," "aiming to eliminate all sources of international hatred," and can "prove the Soviet Union's loyalty to principles and firm adherence to faith." We at least admit that the theory adopted by the Moscow News suits our expectations; therefore, we hope that the Soviet Union's actions in the future will accurately conform to the theory!

### Chamberlain's Remarks Unanimously Endorsed by All British Parties; Germany Issues Statement with Suddenly Strong Attitude; Believes Britain Insults Germany and Decides to Deal with It

London: Opposition Labor Party leader Attlee and Liberal Party leader Sinclair both followed Chamberlain's speech and spoke in succession, endorsing the Prime Minister's important remarks rejecting Hitler's peace proposal. Attlee's remarks were quite impassioned, saying that Hitler wants us to forgive sin and trust sinners. No British government, whether in principle or in reason, can offer an answer different from Chamberlain's (cheers). The people of our country are like this, and the people of other countries must be like this. The one who proposes peace now is a person whose words have absolutely no value, and there is no indication in his proposal of changing his mind and restoring hope for the future. Our tolerance has reached its limit. Hitler could have discussed borders, colonies, raw materials, and disarmament at any time, but he chose the path of power and force. His so-called goodwill towards other countries only proves that it is a prelude to aggression. The German people should know that peace can be obtained at any time, but they must abandon the methods of power and aggression. The German people must know that their government has lost the trust of the world, and abandoning aggression is now an indispensable condition for a peaceful settlement. We are determined to continue the war until we have obtained the necessary conditions for a peaceful world. Our actions are in complete accordance with the policies decided by the Labor Party and passed by the Labor Party's repeated meetings. We must create a new world, a Europe where the rights of all countries are respected. If we want to create a new Europe, we must create a Europe with closer cooperation. We do not believe that colonies should be divided or developed by any one country, but should belong to those who live there. The world's resources should be shared by the world. It is appropriate to make the German people understand that what they should choose now is not the path of no longer being a powerful member of the European countries after defeat, but the path of contributing to a great Europe by ending the war. We must see a new world when the war ends, said the speaker, and those who heard him clapped their hands incessantly. Liberal Party leader Sinclair also endorsed Chamberlain's answer to Hitler, saying that in recent years, whenever an illegal act has occurred, people hear the name of Great Britain and are filled with hope and fear. We must not show weakness or be hesitant in the slightest. We must ensure that the hopes that people generally have for the actions of Great Britain can be realized. Hitler must give credible evidence of his sincerity for peace proposals, he must withdraw his troops from the lands he has violently seized in the past two years, he must immediately allow Poland and Czechoslovakia to restore their freedom, and he must allow the people of Austria to freely express their wishes and decide their own destiny by referendum. If so, then we can start negotiating peace. (12th Reuters Dispatch)

Berlin: After the British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech was delivered, the German government officially declared to foreign reporters at noon today, saying, "Chamberlain's speech is an unprecedented insult to Germany, rejecting Hitler's already outstretched hand of peace, disregarding Hitler's constructive proposals based on a sense of responsibility, and openly choosing the path of war. Chamberlain's speech reveals the true purpose of Britain's war, which is to destroy Germany and the German nation, so that the German people have no doubt about their future actions and know how to choose the path to prevent Britain from achieving its goals." (13th Haitong Dispatch)

### Although Chamberlain's Remarks Are Firm, the Door to Peace Remains Open; France Holds Such a View; London Newspapers' Tone Is Strong

Paris: British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons has just been commented on by observers here, who all say that the arguments and conclusions he put forward are the same as those in Prime Minister Daladier's speech on the 10th of this month. Although the two speakers have their own special tone and format, the content is completely consistent. This is a natural result of mutual consultation between the two governments, and Prime Minister Chamberlain had inquired about the opinions of the various autonomous territories beforehand, so he spoke in the name of the entire British Empire. British observers say that even if Germany makes repeated efforts to alienate Britain and France, it will be in vain, because Britain and France both believe that the promises that the current German government can provide are not sufficient guarantees. The peace sought by Britain and France is by no means a temporary truce between two acts of aggression. In short, the attitude of the two allied countries of Britain and France is not stubborn, nor is it of a vengeful nature, but is frank, bright, and without any doubt. Moreover, the two countries of Britain and France still maintain relations with the Polish government, that is, they still recognize the country's independent sovereignty. The key to answering Hitler's question, whether you act alone or collude with Stalin, you may not arbitrarily decide the fate of a free country, lies in this. In addition, well-informed sources believe that although Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech was very firm, Hitler should still put forward new arguments in order to continue the peace offensive. The recent change in the style of German propaganda organs, which has forcefully stated that only an immediate truce can prevent the spread of communism to Western Europe, is one example. (12th Havas Dispatch)

London: Chamberlain's speech yesterday was warmly welcomed by all newspapers, and it was believed that Britain had decided to mobilize the national power and fight to the end without wavering. The Daily Telegraph editorial said that Chamberlain had replied to the so-called peace proposal of the Fuehrer with firm and clear words. All parts of the British Empire listened to it and praised it. Even in small countries, all those who love peace and regard Britain as a barrier to their right to survival also warmly welcome it. The Prime Minister spoke on behalf of the British Empire. How our country takes a stand is clear and beyond doubt to all countries in the world, whether enemy or neutral. The people of that country's National Socialist Party originally thought that Britain would never go to war no matter what before the outbreak of the war. Now they know that it is a fantasy. Today, the people of the National Socialist Party still hope that our country will seize every opportunity to stop the war, thereby abandoning its previous claims. In other words, they hope that our government will violate its faith and break its word, as the National Socialist Germany has done. Unfortunately, the wishes of these people are still a fantasy and must be abandoned. The Daily Express stated, "After our country decided to fight to the end, the war may be protracted, and the future may be bumpy, but we have already taken action and will not turn back. This has been announced to Fuehrer Hitler by Prime Minister Chamberlain." The Daily Mail stated, "For the sake of our country's freedom and interests, we will not cease fighting until our allies are threatened for one day." (13th Havas Dispatch)

London: Lloyd George spoke at a peace rally yesterday before Chamberlain delivered his speech, hoping that Prime Minister Chamberlain would open the door to negotiations with Germany, saying, "I hope the door to negotiations is not closed, and it is best not to make a hasty decision, because the situation is so serious that we cannot make a rash decision. It must be known that this decision may involve the lives of millions of people and create a very great tragedy and terror, and unimaginable consequences." (13th United Press Dispatch)

### Germany Still Hopes for American Mediation

The Hague, Netherlands: The Handelsblad and other newspapers here all reported that German Fuehrer Hitler convened several of his closest aides at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs late last night to study British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the country's House of Commons. German official spokespersons also spoke to foreign reporters afterwards, explaining their position, with five key points: (1) The exchange of views between the British countries has ended; (2) In order to avoid a war whose outcome is unpredictable, the neutral countries, under the leadership of the United States, should advise Britain and France to attach importance to peace and declare that they cannot continue to support it; (3) Germany believes that the Soviet Union will definitely fulfill all the covenants it has accepted; (4) Germany still does not want to engage in war and does not want to declare war on Britain and France, but will only do its best to defend itself; (5) Germany will still wait for some time to allow the neutral countries to take action. (13th Havas Dispatch)

Berlin: Political figures here all believe that Chamberlain's speech is tantamount to rejecting Germany's peace proposal and deciding to continue the war. When Daladier delivered his speech, there was still a glimmer of hope for peace. Establishing an understanding was still a possible fact. This belief has now disappeared. Chamberlain's rhetoric and his attack on the German government's policies have made the people of Berlin feel quite angry. Political figures declared that Chamberlain's hasty rejection of Hitler's peace proposal was very surprising. A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry declared that Chamberlain had not put forward any concrete proposals. (13th Haitong Dispatch)

### The United States and Italy Are Unwilling to Mediate

Rome: British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons yesterday rejecting Hitler's peace proposal did not surprise people here, because they knew that Hitler's position on the British and French countries had already been decided after his speech to the parliament. It has been repeatedly stated here that Italy's neutral status will not change in the slightest, and it is generally believed that continuing the peace movement is not necessary now. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

Washington: Well-informed sources say that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's refusal to accept Hitler's peace terms shows that President Roosevelt's refusal to mediate the European war at this time is wise. If Hitler really wants peace, he must provide more credible guarantees of good faith. The restoration of independence to Poland and Czechoslovakia is an indispensable condition. (12th Reuters Dispatch)

### Chamberlain to Broadcast Speech Tonight; Wartime Emergency Budget Passed by Parliament

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to broadcast a speech to the nation on Saturday night, outlining the latest situation in the international situation. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

London: The wartime emergency budget bill, which stipulates income of £995,000,000 and expenditure of £1,933,000,000, was passed by the Upper House today and was immediately approved by the King. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

### Germany's Future Strategy; Hitler Said to Be Going to the Western Front; Hopes for a Quick Victory Fade

London: Now that Hitler's peace movement has failed, military commentators are speculating about Germany's war plans. Many believe that the German authorities will definitely advance as soon as possible in order to fulfill their promise to the German people that the war will be over before winter. The idea of ​​passing through Belgium now seems to be more and more hopeless, because from the Moselle River in Liege to the Albert Canal in Antwerp is a strong barrier line. It is heard that the Belgians have recently strengthened their defenses along this canal. Committing crimes against French territory via Switzerland is also a dangerous matter, so judging from this, Germany will at least make great efforts to try to drive the French army out of German territory. French commentators believe that the gradually increasing strength of the German army's attacks in this area is worthy of attention. It is heard that the German side is now eager to know where the British army is. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

Amsterdam: The Telegraph here reported that the Berlin Chancellery seems to have made preparations for Hitler to set off for the front line. It is heard that Hitler will set up his headquarters near the Siegfried Line. Residents of Aachen, Dusseldorf, and other major cities in the Rhineland seem to have been ordered to prepare to evacuate. All Jewish schools in Berlin have been cleared to accommodate evacuated people. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

The Finnish organization "Apeetai" newspaper suggested that the five Nordic countries should form a group in the manner of the British Empire.

Stockholm – Prime Minister Hansson delivered a speech today, explaining the government's decision to strictly adhere to neutrality to ensure that Sweden avoids being drawn into the vortex of the war. The belligerent countries have provided us with guarantees to respect our rights and have stated their willingness to maintain normal trade with our country. However, in fact, our exports are often intercepted even if they are not on the list of prohibited items set by the belligerent countries. Thus, not only is our country's right to trade infringed upon, but also our trade relations with other neutral countries have become difficult. We have therefore had to protest to the governments of the belligerent countries. Fortunately, the situation has improved recently, which is very gratifying." In addition, Minister of National Defense Sköld recently delivered a speech in Gothenburg, stating, "Sweden must be prepared to defend peace and freedom. Our army is excellent and can be mobilized at any time. The naval power is higher than other countries along the Baltic Sea coast and is sufficient for self-defense." (Havas News Agency, 12th)

Riga – Prime Minister Ulmanis said in a speech at the National Cultural and Economic Association, "Our country has recently signed a mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union. We will definitely fulfill all the obligations stipulated in this treaty." Our country must strictly maintain neutrality in the current war. "We hope to increase business relations with Germany, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and other countries." The withdrawal of Germans to Germany is at the request of that country and is not related to the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty. (Havas News Agency, 12th)

### British and German Naval and Air Forces; Fierce Battle in the North Sea; 100 German Aircraft Participate in the Attack; Five British Ships Suffer No Losses

Oslo – Crew members of the Norwegian fishing vessel "Kvaløy" witnessed German aircraft engaging British ships in the North Sea on Sunday. It is claimed that no fewer than one hundred and fifty German aircraft participated in the attack on five British ships in the North Sea that day. The British ships sailed in curved lines at full speed. The fishing vessel was located in the center of the battle. When the British ships fired anti-aircraft guns, bombs fell around the fishing vessel, and the fishing vessel changed course several times, but the battle seemed to follow. Finally, the German aircraft flew east, and the British ships went west. According to British communiqués, the German aircraft attacked for five hours, dropping more than one hundred bombs, but the British ships were not hit and suffered no casualties. (Reuters News Agency, 13th)

London – The British naval authorities recently issued an official report stating that on the afternoon of October 8, British aircraft discovered a squadron of German ships, including one large cruiser, one small cruiser, and five destroyers. After the British aircraft detected their movements, they reported to the domestic fleet. As a result, some British ships sailed to the indicated location to prepare for battle, but before they could engage the German ships, night had fallen, and it was impossible to observe the whereabouts of the German ships. From 8:30 AM the next morning, German aircraft attacked from time to time until 4:30 PM. Most of the German aircraft acted alone or attacked in pairs, first attacking a British torpedo destroyer, and then dropping bombs on several British cruisers and two other torpedo skirmishers, but the attacks were ineffective, and none of the bombs hit their targets. Although two bombs fell next to a British cruiser and fragments fell on the ship, there was no damage. All the ships' anti-aircraft guns were fired upwards. According to reports received, two German aircraft crashed in Denmark, and another was damaged and towed into Sylt, indicating that the German aircraft had been damaged by the British ships' anti-aircraft guns.

### Canada Trains; Aviation Talent; Britain Increases Munitions Production

Ottawa – Canada's greatest contribution during the war is to train 6,000 aircraft pilots each year. In the future, when necessary, this can be increased to 20,000 or even 25,000 per year. Although Canada's population is only 11 million, it is not very difficult to undertake this major task due to the extreme development of commercial aviation in peacetime and the suitable geographical conditions. At present, there are 22 primary aviation schools, and their training period was originally 50 weeks, which can be reduced to 28 weeks if necessary. After graduating, the trainees will receive further special training for a certain period of time in accordance with the British method. In addition, according to the plan set by the British government, aviation students from the country and the self-governing territories will come to Canada for further study after preliminary training. Therefore, the federal government is preparing to add advanced aviation schools in areas with geographical conditions suitable for learning to fly to meet the needs. (Havas News Agency, 12th)

London – British national armaments factories are currently stepping up production day and night, and the intensity of their work is rarely seen before. In a certain shipyard, there are currently 90,000 male and female workers working in shifts, day and night without interruption. The factory is so large that it can accommodate the large mail ships "Queen Mary" and "Queen Elizabeth" without appearing cramped. The plant also has Europe's largest electric melting furnace, with so much electricity, simultaneously melting 70 tons of metal. A certain factory consumes an average of 150,000 tons of coal, 150 million watts of electricity, and 1.5 million cubic feet of gas per year, which is several times more than in peacetime. The enthusiasm of their work can be seen here. (Havas News Agency, 12th)

### Another British Ship; Sunk by German Submarine

"Bremen" Moored in Soviet Territory

London – The Ministry of Information recently released news stating that the British ship "Heronspool" has been sunk by a German submarine. All sailors were rescued by an American ship. (Havas News Agency, 13th)

London – After the German mail ship "Bremen" set sail from New York on August 30, rumors arose, saying that the ship had been intercepted by a British warship or had fled to a neutral country. According to a report from the Daily People's Voice correspondent in The Hague, the ship has indeed sailed to Murmansk, a port in northern Russia. After the ship was allowed to depart by the American authorities, it sailed east at full speed and did not carry passengers. In the evening, all the lights on the ship were turned off, and the windows were tightly closed. The next day, the captain ordered the sailors to lower the lifeboats close to the sea surface, so that the painters could use them to paint the ship dark gray. On the morning of September 3, the captain summoned all the crew members for a speech, in which he spoke generously, vowing not to hand over the ship to the enemy, and would rather destroy it himself if necessary. (Joint Havas News Agency, 13th)

### Polish Foreign Minister Broadcasts Speech in England; Deeply Moved by British and French Determination to Fight

London – Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski said in a broadcast here last night that he was extremely moved by the Allies' determination to continue the war, regardless of sacrifice, and not to prolong the war. Officials from the northern and northeastern European countries are now questioning whether Europe has lost its freedom. He would like to say to them, "Cheer up, I have seen the British and French war machines in action." It is reported that Zaleski arrived in London two days ago to discuss the Allies' views on the war and future war actions with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax. He left London for Paris today. (Reuters, 13th)

### United States Does Not Recognize; German-Occupied Poland

Washington – According to reliable sources here today, the Treasury Department will increase a punitive tax on goods shipped to the United States from the German-occupied areas of Poland. Since the outbreak of the European war, German-American trade has greatly decreased, so this action by the United States to increase import duties on German goods is simply an expression of the United States' non-recognition of Germany's conquest of Poland. (Associated Press, 13th)

### US Senate Debates; Neutrality Act; Chairman of Commerce Committee Suggests; To Maintain Freedom of Navigation

Washington – During yesterday's Senate debate on the Neutrality Act amendment, there was a very high call to allow American ships to freely navigate on the high seas, except in the European war zone. Senator Bailey, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, urged the Senate to allow American merchants to promote their trade with belligerent countries. He said that the restrictions on American shipping in the Neutrality Act amendment would severely damage American commerce. The US government must allow American ships to continue sailing to Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, French Indochina, the Straits Settlements, and South Africa. Bailey's proposal has been submitted to Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for review. (Associated Press, 13th)

Washington – The Senate continued to debate the Neutrality Act amendment today. Progressive Party Senator La Follette, who usually supported President Roosevelt's policies, suddenly delivered a speech today, opposing the repeal of the arms embargo clause, saying that this would hinder American national defense. The Congress's discussion of the Neutrality Act amendment is tantamount to the United States' partial participation in the European war. The urgent task for the United States at present is to concentrate its efforts and implement an active economic policy in the Western Hemisphere, so as to revive trade relations between American countries on a sound basis. In short, the United States should stay out of the European situation, because participation in the European war will inevitably lead to the destruction of American democracy. In addition, Democratic Party dissident Senator Bullock also delivered a speech opposing the repeal of the arms embargo clause, stating that most senators who advocate the repeal of this clause have been incited by certain domestic parties, and the wishes of these people are only to take the opportunity to obtain huge profits. After hearing this, Democratic government Senator Burke immediately protested and asked Bullock to name the senators. Bullock replied that although he could not specify who, he felt that the motive of those senators who advocated the repeal of the arms embargo clause was to make profits when he met with certain senators. Finally, Democratic Party dissident Senators Wheeler and Savanthus also opposed the repeal of this clause. It is reported that there are ten senators who are ambiguous about the Neutrality Act amendment, and Savanthus is also one of them. (Havas News Agency, 12th)

### Romania; Strengthens Eastern Border Defense; Soviet Union Still Does Not Forget Lost Territory

Bucharest – It is reported that Romania is withdrawing a portion of its troops from the Hungarian border and transferring them to Bessarabia, which was ceded from the Soviet Union and incorporated into Romania in 1918, in order to be prepared, because it is heard that after resolving the Finnish issue, the Soviet Union will turn its attention to Bessarabia. Soviet newspapers celebrated the 15th anniversary of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic yesterday, contrasting the situation of the Moldavians living on the Soviet side of the Dniester River with the "suffering" of the Moldavians living on the other side of the river, i.e., the residents of Bessarabia. Although the cession of Bessarabia was recognized by the Allied Supreme Council on March 3, 1920, and stipulated in the Treaty of Paris, it is still a matter of dispute between the Soviet Union and Romania. The two countries therefore began negotiations in Genoa in 1922 and in Vienna in 1924, but neither was successful. Bessarabia has a population of 2,625,000, of which more than 1,585,000 are Moldavians. (Reuters, 13th)

### Italy; Hesitates and Looks Around; Soviet Influence Westward; Expresses Extreme Anxiety

Rome – The evolving international situation has made Italian political circles feel hesitant and unable to decide what to do. Since Germany and the Soviet Union colluded with each other, Italy has been extremely anxious, believing that the Soviet Union's expansion of influence to the Baltic coastal countries is to obtain strategic points in northeastern Europe to defend against Germany. Its ultimate goal is still southeastern Europe and the Dardanelles Strait. Therefore, Italy, which could have an advantage in the Danube River basin and the Balkan Peninsula, will henceforth be taken away by Germany and the Soviet Union. In addition, Germany's attitude towards the Soviet Union has made Spain very dissatisfied, and it is heard that Spanish leader Franco has expressed to the Italian government that it is surprising that certain Italian newspapers openly advocate increasing relations with the Soviet Union. Senior figures of the Italian Fascist Party are quite moved, but some senior Italian government officials clearly advocate that Italian newspapers should not attack the Soviet government authorities. Judging from this, Soviet Ambassador to Italy Goreikin will soon come to take office, carrying a letter of credence, and the title used for the King of Italy is equivalent to recognizing Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and Albania. Therefore, the Italian government does not want public opinion to adopt a hostile attitude to avoid offending the Soviet Union. (Havas News Agency, 12th)

### Soviet-Turkish Defense Agreement; Rumored to Have Been Signed

London – A dispatch from Stanley, a reporter for the News Chronicle, stated that, according to reliable sources in Stanley, the Soviet-Turkish Defense Treaty has been signed. This treaty stipulates that Turkey will blockade the straits in exchange for the Soviet Union's guarantee for the Balkans. (Reuters, 13th)

### German-Bulgarian Trade Agreement; Negotiations Completed

Sofia – German-Bulgarian trade negotiations have now been completed. Bulgaria has obtained more favorable terms. Bulgaria's exports to Germany will be increased. Bulgaria was originally unwilling to export leather, meat, and hemp, but it has now obtained the special privilege of paying for goods in cash. In order to obtain what it needs, Germany has had to agree to supply Bulgaria with oil and cotton. (Reuters, 13th)

### President Roosevelt; Concerned about European War Refugees

Advises Charitable Organizations; To Cooperate in Raising Relief Funds

Washington – President Roosevelt recently issued a public announcement, applying for charitable organizations to cooperate in raising funds to help European war refugees. He said, "Although our country is neutral in this tragic war, we cannot stand idly by as the civilians of the belligerent countries, especially women and children, suffer." (Havas News Agency, 12th)

### Berlin Air Defense Installations

More Stringent Than Before

Berlin – The Berlin authorities are making various air defense preparations even more stringent than before. Lighting will be subjected to absolute control. In the event of an air raid alert, the aim is to achieve total darkness throughout the city. All shop signs and vehicles, in particular, must pay attention. Bicycles with lights left on will be confiscated as a warning. Pedestrians must cross the street at intersections. Domestic dogs must be leashed and not allowed to run around freely. (Hai Tong Telegraph, 13th)

### Eight German Pilots Detained After Landing in Denmark

Copenhagen – Several days ago, eight German pilots landed in Danish territory and were taken into custody. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the former residence of the Danish King in Viborg, where they will be permitted to leave only after the end of the war. (Hai Tong Telegraph, 13th)

### Soviet Union Will Not Recognize Organizations Under Japanese Protection; Closing of Consulates in China Reveals Intention; Rumors Abound That Britain Will Again Make Concessions to Japan

Chongqing – The closure of Soviet consulates in Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou has been confirmed by Soviet sources here. According to these sources, the Soviet Union's withdrawal of its consular representatives from these Japanese-occupied areas serves to indicate that the Soviet Union is unwilling to recognize the "Central Government" under Japanese protection. However, in Harbin, Manchuria, due to the presence of 60,000 Soviet citizens, it is necessary to maintain a consulate there for their protection. Although this action by the Soviet side will provoke resentment from the Japanese side, it is not expected to lead to any formal protest. (Associated Press, 13th)

London – According to reliable sources, Britain and Japan will jointly issue an important declaration in which Britain will make considerable concessions to Japan in the Far East. The content of the Anglo-Japanese declaration was agreed upon during a meeting on Wednesday between Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, and Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura. The nature of Britain's concessions is not yet known. According to official statements, this matter has been discussed and decided with the British government in the past few days. It is widely believed that Britain's concessions will include British economic and political interests in North China, or may accede to Japanese demands regarding Tianjin. Naval sources declined to comment on these rumors, stating only that they had not received any reports from the Admiralty regarding the withdrawal of surplus ships from the China Station. According to the most reliable sources, the British government has not fully acceded to Japan's demands to completely withdraw British troops from China. (Associated Press, 13th)

British Warships Patrol Japanese Territorial Waters, Causing Japanese Resentment

Tokyo – Regarding the news reported by the "Nichinichi Shimbun" that British warships are patrolling Japanese territorial waters and even stopping Japanese merchant ships, the British official announcement has confirmed that British warships are under orders to conduct normal patrols near Japanese territorial waters, just as British warships do in other parts of the world, and that this is "absolutely normal" in wartime. This statement has aroused great indignation among Japanese officials, who consider the patrolling of another country's territorial waters as a "normal thing" to be clearly provocative. Japan is currently at war with China, and cannot accept this view of the British side. Political figures believe that the Japanese government will issue a statement clarifying Japan's attitude towards this matter. (Hai Tong Telegraph, 13th)

Two Hundred U.S. Army Aircraft to Strengthen Hawaiian Defenses

Washington – The U.S. War Department last night accelerated plans to dispatch air forces to Hawaii, the Panama Canal, and Puerto Rico to strengthen defenses there. Large air force units will soon be sent to the above locations in accordance with the War Department's $300 million air force expansion program. This program will be completed by July 1, 1941, at which time the number of army aircraft will reach 5,500. The War Department's new program will effectively double the current air force strength and increase the number of aviators to operate the increased number of aircraft. The initial action of the new army program will be the dispatch of 200 fighter, bomber, amphibian, and transport aircraft to Hawaii in a few weeks. Government officials claim that the government's strengthening of the Hawaiian air force strength is consistent with the Navy Department's plan to strengthen the defenses of Pearl Harbor. (Associated Press, 13th)

### Japanese Communist Party Seizes the Opportunity to Operate; Japanese Authorities Intensify Precautions

Tokyo – The Home Minister, in a speech at the annual meeting of prefectural police chiefs yesterday, strongly emphasized the need to impose strict control over radical elements in Japan. It is claimed that the Communists may take the opportunity of the signing of the armistice agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union to resume their activities. Japan's left-leaning elements are still plotting, and given the current situation, it is unknown when they will attempt to sharpen their claws or incite unrest caused by various economic control measures affecting the lives of the whole nation due to the Nomonhan armistice agreement. More than two years have passed since the start of the China Incident, and the people of the country have been able to maintain unity from top to bottom. Recently, a portion of the people, due to the outbreak of the European War, the progress of the Chinese "Central Government," and the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese armistice agreement, tend to hold optimistic views regarding the future of the China Incident. (Reuters, 13th)

### Turbulence in Japanese Foreign Ministry; Solution Established; Appointment and Dismissal of Commercial Attaches to be the Responsibility of the Foreign Minister; Dignity of Cabinet Change Resolution Swept Away; Resignation Letters of Various Officials Returned Separately

Tokyo – Regarding the turmoil in the Foreign Ministry, Prime Minister Abe stated at today's cabinet meeting that he requested that each cabinet member allow him to assume responsibility for resolving it. He intends to seek appropriate solutions after further consultations with Foreign Minister Nomura. Regarding the issue of establishing a Ministry of Trade, he also intends to give appropriate consideration to avoid the occurrence of non-unified diplomacy. He asked for the understanding of each cabinet member, and each cabinet member also understood the Prime Minister's intention and decided that if necessary, they would not hesitate to revise the decisions made at the cabinet meeting on the 3rd of this month, and that all matters would be left to the Prime Minister's handling. (Domei News Agency, 13th)

Tokyo – Regarding the turmoil in the Ministry of Trade, today's cabinet meeting has decided that the Prime Minister will be responsible for resolving it. The Prime Minister's proposed solution is as follows: (1) The clause in the Outline for the Establishment of the Ministry of Trade which stipulates that "the authority to appoint and dismiss commercial attaches shall still be exercised by the Minister of Foreign Affairs as at present" shall be stipulated in the official system of the Ministry of Trade. (2) Consequently, there will be a change in the Outline for the Establishment of the Ministry of Trade regarding the authority to appoint and dismiss commercial attaches. However, as a matter of understanding in the cabinet meeting, the authority to appoint and dismiss commercial attaches will be transferred to the Minister of Trade in the future when the official system of the Ministry of Trade is revised. (Domei News Agency, 13th)

Tokyo – At 6:00 p.m. today, Foreign Minister Nomura convened a meeting of all senior officials in the Ministry in the Second Conference Room of the main building. Foreign Minister Nomura stood up and stated, "The Ministry of Trade issue has been resolved in today's cabinet meeting through consultations between the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. You should trust the mediation of these two and withdraw your resignations." The representative of the administrative authorities, Chief Secretary Takase, also stood up and replied, "We are deeply moved by your instructions. From now on, we will follow your orders, restore the original state, and strive to govern." Therefore, regarding the issue of establishing the Ministry of Trade, a satisfactory solution has in fact been reached. Therefore, it has been decided to return the resignation letters separately. The resignation letters of the bureau chiefs will be handed over by the Foreign Minister, and the resignation letters of the administrative officials will be handed over by the section chiefs. However, the Foreign Minister has approved the retention of the resignation letters of Vice-Minister Tani and Bureau Chief Matsushima. (Domei News Agency, 13th)

Tokyo – The "Nichinichi Shimbun" claims that Prime Minister Abe has declared that the government is prepared to make a concession regarding the turmoil in the Foreign Ministry. It is expected that the concession that the cabinet will make will be a complete change of the cabinet's attitude. If this is the case, then the dignity of the cabinet will be completely lost, and the faith of the people will be swept away. The three agricultural and land reclamation provinces, which did not approve of the Ministry of Trade plan, will no longer remain silent. In any case, changing the cabinet's decision will establish an unwelcome bad precedent. If the cabinet cannot handle domestic affairs properly, then it cannot be relied upon to handle diplomacy and the China Incident. The Foreign Minister cannot bear sole responsibility for the Foreign Ministry dispute; the cabinet also has a responsibility. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that the cabinet has become despised, and the result may be greatly detrimental to the cabinet. (Reuters, 13th)

Hong Kong – The Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong, Okazaki, told reporters today that, following the same steps as diplomats elsewhere, he has telegraphed Tokyo that if the current regulations regarding the organization of the new Ministry of Trade are not revised, then the staff of the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong will also resign. However, he is confident that this matter can be satisfactorily resolved in the end. As for the rumor that the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, has already resigned, he believes it is inaccurate. (Reuters, 13th)

### Frontline Battles Lost; Japanese Aircraft Indiscriminately Bombing; Attacking Various Locations in Western Hunan and Southern Sichuan in Batches; As Many as Seventy or Eighty Japanese Aircraft Dispatched

Chongqing – Recently, after the Japanese suffered losses on the front lines, they have been idle and resorted to indiscriminately dispatching aircraft to bomb and vent their anger. A few days ago, aircraft were dispatched to bomb various locations in Shaanxi Province. On the 13th, another seventy or eighty Japanese aircraft were dispatched to attack various locations in western Hunan and southern Sichuan in batches. The Japanese aircraft came in four batches. The first batch of eighteen aircraft attacked Yuanling in western Hunan from Hubei, dropped bombs, and then fled. Soon after, the second batch of fifteen aircraft also followed to Chenxi in western Hunan to drop bombs. When they flew back past Yuanling, they dropped the remaining bombs again before fleeing. The third batch of Japanese aircraft, numbering thirty-six, flew from western Hubei to attack Liangshan in eastern Sichuan, indiscriminately dropping bombs before fleeing towards eastern Hubei. However, the details of the losses are not yet clear. The fourth batch of Japanese aircraft, also numbering eighteen, attacked Nanchuan in southern Sichuan from Hubei, dropping a large number of explosive and incendiary bombs without any specific target. For a time, there were several fires in the suburbs, which spread rapidly. Dozens of civilian houses were destroyed, and more than one hundred civilians were killed or injured. After the Japanese aircraft wreaked havoc, they fled eastward. The local air defense headquarters issued an air raid alert, which was lifted in the afternoon. It is also reported that after the bombing of Nanchuan, the New Transportation Association and the Chongqing Emergency Relief Joint Office have sent personnel with medicines and other supplies to Nanchuan to provide emergency assistance. (13th Telegraph)

Chongqing – At noon today, a large number of Japanese aircraft, divided into several teams, attacked various locations in Sichuan Province. Chengdu and Nanchuan were both bombed. The city of Chongqing issued an alert at 10:00 a.m. Chinese fighter planes also took off to be on guard, but the Japanese planes did not appear. The alert was lifted three and a half hours later. The details of the bombing of Chengdu and Nanchuan are not yet known. The bombing of Chengdu was originally expected, because after the announcement of the news that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife were currently there, everyone expected the Japanese aircraft to take this action. A Reuters reporter tried to make a long-distance call from Chongqing to Nanchuan this afternoon, but the call did not go through due to damaged wires. Nanchuan is located in the southeast of Chongqing and is famous for Mount Jinfo. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife resided there a month ago. This afternoon, news was also received here that Guiyang was also bombed, but it has not yet been confirmed. (Reuters, 13th)

Yuanling – At about 10:00 a.m. today, six Japanese aircraft invaded the airspace above our city and dropped dozens of bombs in the suburbs. The details of the losses are under investigation. Another batch of nine Japanese aircraft sneaked into Chenxi to drop bombs. (13th Telegraph)

Xi'an – Japanese aircraft continued to fly over Shaanxi this morning, wreaking havoc. A total of 20 aircraft, divided into three batches, flew from Shanxi to Shaanxi. At about 8:00 a.m., they dropped thirteen bombs in the suburbs of the city, causing no losses to the Chinese side. Then, at 11:30 a.m., they arrived at Huaxian and Weinan one after another, dropping more than seventy bombs, killing more than twenty innocent civilians. They then flew to Heyang, spying along the river. The last batch of nine aircraft invaded Weinan again at 1:40 p.m., dropping more than thirty bombs before fleeing east. (12th Telegraph)

Chongqing – It is now known that eighteen Japanese aircraft heavily bombed the small town of Nanchuan on the southeast highway of Chongqing this afternoon. At that time, there were many fires. It is now believed that there must be many deaths and injuries. The local authorities have sent medical teams to provide relief. Other Japanese aircraft bombed Liangsha (transliteration) in southeastern Sichuan Province and several cities in Hunan Province. The previous transmission that Chengdu had been bombed has been denied by the authorities. (Reuters, 12th)

Changde – Several Japanese aircraft invaded Jiangxi, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces again today in batches. A batch of eight aircraft bombed Yuanling at 10:00 a.m., a batch of nine aircraft bombed Chenxi at 10:00 a.m., a batch of eighteen aircraft disturbed Nanchuan County in southern Sichuan at 10:00 a.m., and a batch of thirty-two aircraft attacked Liangshan at 1:00 p.m. (13th Telegraph)

### The Victory in the Battle of Northern Hunan is of Great Significance

—Speech by Deputy Director Feng—

Chongqing – General Feng Yuxiang, Deputy Director of the Chinese Military Affairs Commission and concurrently Director of Training, stated in a radio broadcast today that the victory of the Chinese army in Changsha has become a great feat in history. Feng stated, "In the history of the Chinese civil wars, no army defending Changsha has been able to resist the enemy's offensive, because the terrain around Changsha is all flat, which is extremely favorable to the attacker. Under such circumstances, the Chinese army defending Changsha was able to successfully resist the Japanese army, which is truly commendable. The significance of the victory in northern Hunan is greater than the Battle of Taierzhuang in southern Shandong, because the strength of the Japanese army is gradually weakening, and the power of attack is also decreasing. The White Army took advantage of the outbreak of the European War to intensify the war against China, attempting to end the war as soon as possible. Not long ago, the Japanese army boldly declared that the Japanese army would attack Xi'an, Yichang, Changsha, and Hengyang. What the Japanese army encountered today was an unprecedented defeat in Hunan Province. This can indicate that no matter what changes occur in the European situation, if our army continues to resist valiantly, then our army will surely win the final victory. What's more, the European situation continues to be favorable to China, so those who are stunned by the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact and the signing of the Nomonhan armistice agreement between the Soviet Union and Japan can be said to be worrying unnecessarily. We recall that the Soviet Union and Japan also signed an armistice agreement after the Zhanggufeng incident, but that agreement did not prevent the continued conflict between the Soviet and Japanese troops in the Nomonhan area. By analogy, the Nomonhan armistice treaty also cannot prevent future battles between the Soviet and Japanese armies in other places. The Soviet Union is not a hypocritical friend of China. The Soviet Union's assistance to China shows the country's sincerity in supporting China, so Japan must always defend against the Soviet Union. In addition to the Soviet Union being Japan's powerful enemy, Japanese soldiers must also defend against the United States, because the United States sent a large fleet of warships and several squadrons of aircraft to the Pacific, which greatly shocked the Japanese. In addition, Pittman's proposal to amend the Neutrality Act has received great support from Americans. The United States will impose an embargo on the export of military supplies to Japan after the expiration of the Japanese-American commercial treaty signed in 1911 in January of next year, which is a serious threat to Japan. The international situation is favorable to China, mostly due to China's resolute resistance, which will continue to be favorable to China day after day." (Associated Press, 12th)

### Increased Restrictions on Entry and Exit to Tianjin Concessions

Tianjin – Although there are rumors here that the Japanese will remove the restrictions on the British and French concessions tomorrow, in fact, the Japanese restrictions on the British and French concessions have only been tightened, and there is no sign of relaxation. Anyone entering Japanese-controlled areas from the concessions must present a recent cholera vaccination certificate. (Associated Press, 13th)

### Yunnan Newspaper Comments on Kunming Commodity Prices

Kunming – Today, newspapers here commented on the continued rise in rice prices, which have reached 40 yuan per dan. The Min Guo Daily stated that even at this high price, it is sometimes impossible to buy it, which shows a lack of rice or hoarding. The Chao Bao stated that the prices of both spiritual and physical food have soared, referring to the current sharp rise in paper prices, which have reached 80 yuan per ream, so those who sell books are losing money.

### Japanese Cars from Wuxi Transporting Cocoons to Yi Are Attacked

Two Japanese Guards Killed

Wuxi Correspondence. As autumn cocoons flood the market, the "Central China Silk Company" established by the Japanese side has purchased autumn cocoons in Yixing. In the previous ten days, trucks were sent to transport them. By the 6th of Muyue, three trucks had been transported back. On the 7th, four trucks were sent to load dried cocoons, starting from Yi and passing through Heqiao to Yangwan. Suddenly, they encountered an attack by guerrillas, who opened fire on the trucks. The first two trucks escaped, but the last two trucks were blocked. The escorting Japanese guards, Ishikawa Teruichi and Tokuda Masao, resisted stubbornly and were shot dead on the spot. More than ten packages of dried cocoons were confiscated. The bodies of the two Japanese were snatched back to the "Central China Company" dormitory in Xixi, outside the city. The Japanese held a community funeral on the 9th, with Japanese monks chanting scriptures and paying respects. The Japanese side, having suffered this loss, is now wary of transporting goods.

### Chinese Guerrilla Unit Approaches Baoshan County Seat

Japanese Spies Arrested

Baoshan Correspondence. Lu Axiang, the leader of the Chinese guerrilla unit in Baoshan, has become increasingly powerful after destroying Jin Liangfan's troops. Recently, he merged with Jin Pinzhen's guerrilla unit in Jifuqiao and Yin Xiongwan's guerrilla unit in Wangjiaqiao. The Jiangsu Provincial Government specially appointed Lu as the Commander of the Jiangzhe Border Region, who was sworn in at Xixi on Double Tenth Festival.

### Anti-Treason Squad in Dinghai Warns Puppets

Explosion Heard Outside the East Suburb of the County Seat at Midnight

Dinghai Correspondence. Dinghai is located in the east of Zhejiang, isolated overseas, formed by a cluster of islands. The people are fierce and courageous, and there have always been many generous and upright people. This time, although it suffered a tragic fall due to lack of support, the people of the four villages are determined to restore the city and eliminate traitors as their duty. Therefore, they have organized various groups in the four villages to plan for the restoration of the city. As a result, the four villages are under the control of the Chinese guerrillas, and the Japanese army has never dared to cross the suburbs. The puppets in the city are even more fearful and uneasy day and night. Recently, the guerrillas have become more active in the suburbs. One night recently, at around 11:00 p.m., a hand grenade explosion was suddenly heard in the east suburb of the city. Upon hearing the sound, the Japanese and puppet troops closed the city and dared not come out. They did not go out of the city to investigate until the next morning, when they saw a hole blasted in the vicinity of the XIn Bridge Head outside the East Gate, containing a note that read, "Since the fall of Dinghai, local tyrants and evil gentry have willingly attached themselves to the enemy. Although there are a few who are enthusiastic local gentry who have been forced to take office, there are indeed many who use being a traitor to enrich their pockets and exploit the people. This squad is giving a warning to these traitors by setting off this hand grenade tonight. If they do not come to their senses, they will be shot to death to vent the public's anger." Signed: Loyal and Righteous Anti-Treason Squad. It is heard that after this incident, the Japanese and puppet troops became even more alarmed, and the defense of the city gates became even tighter.

### Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Dinghai

Heavy Casualties on Both Sides; Japanese Troops Retreat to the City

Dinghai Correspondence. It has been more than three months since the fall of Dinghai County. County Magistrate Su Benshan, under orders, led his troops to station on various islands under the jurisdiction of Dinghai County and in the suburbs of the county seat, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack, and dispatched political workers to assist in mobilizing the masses and to comfort the residents in the city, distributing letters to the people, and warning the puppet officials. On the morning of September 25th, as the County Magistrate was leading his troops to encircle and suppress bandits and puppet troops in the Ganlan Township area, more than 100 Japanese troops in the city suddenly came out of the city to support the bandits and puppet troops. At that time, the bandits and puppet troops had already been defeated miserably and were fleeing towards Baiquan Gaoxie area. The County Magistrate also took advantage of the victory to pursue them, and a battle ensued with the Japanese troops. The County Magistrate urgently transferred reinforcements from the islands and launched a fierce attack to the southwest, charging four times in succession. At the same time, fighting also broke out in the area outside the East Gate. Japanese warships anchored in Weitou Donggangpu urgently lowered speedboats and used machine guns to strafe in support. After several hours, the Japanese troops retreated to the city and closed the doors to defend. In this battle, there were heavy casualties on both sides. Yu Zefang (former primary school teacher, 27 years old) and other young political workers who assisted County Magistrate Su died heroically.

### Military Commission Announces One Week of Combat Summary: October 4th to 10th

Chongqing: One Week of War Situation (October 4th to 10th). The Military Commission Spokesperson stated that since the great victory in the Xiang, Hubei, and Jiangxi northern regions last week, the morale of the Chinese army has been increasingly boosted. This week, taking advantage of the victory, all lines have advanced fiercely, continuing to pursue and eliminate the defeated and remnant Japanese troops. The number of enemy killed and the territory recovered are almost unprecedented in previous decisive battles. Regarding the progress of the operations, the more important aspects are summarized as follows:

(Xiang-E Front): The Japanese troops who invaded Changsha from northern Hunan suffered a thorough defeat last week at the hands of the Chinese. After reaching the southern bank of the Miluo River, the Japanese army began to collapse completely. In recent days, the Chinese army has advanced triumphantly, sweeping like a storm. On the evening of the 5th, the Japanese troops who were trapped fighting with their backs to the river on the southern bank of the Miluo River were completely wiped out. The important strongholds of Yingtian, Miluo, Xinshi, Xiangyin, and Pingjiang were recovered. Another pursuit force also occupied Xianzhong, Changshou Street east of Pingjiang on the same day. The entire Chinese army crossed the Miluo River again, pursuing north along multiple routes. One route along the railway successively captured Taolin, Huangsha Street, Huanggu City, Dajing Street, Changle Street, Yanglin Street, Xinqiang City, and Huang'an City, and crossed the Xinqiang River to the north, recovering Rongjiawan and Huangkou, and pursued fiercely. On the evening of the 8th, they had already approached Yueyang County. On the 9th, they once stormed into the city. Another route along the northeast of Pingjiang successively captured Meixian, Nanjiang, Shangta City, and Jiuling, and approached the outskirts of Tongcheng on the morning of the 9th, launching a fierce attack on the city. In total, over 40,000 Japanese troops were killed in this campaign. The Japanese army, having suffered such heavy losses, is now at the end of its strength. Regarding the Chinese army in Hubei, they have also launched offensives on all fronts in the past week. The Chinese army in Hubei attacked Qianjiang. The Chinese army in eastern Hubei defeated the Japanese troops who landed at Yinshan and invaded Tianjia Town, inflicting heavy casualties.

(Jiangxi Front): The Japanese retreating from the northwest of Xiushui in northern Jiangxi were fiercely pursued by the Chinese, and Zhajin was successively recovered. Japanese corpses were piled up like mountains. A remnant force of over a thousand fled in disarray. They once sneaked into the vicinity of Xiushui. In order to lure and annihilate the Japanese troops, the Chinese implemented a plan. The city defense troops temporarily transferred. After the Japanese sneaked into the city, they were surrounded and attacked from all sides. Unable to break through, they were completely annihilated by the Chinese by the evening of the 8th. Xiushui was recovered on the 9th, and they advanced triumphantly, pressing on Wuning. The Chinese army southwest of Fengxin, after recovering places like Shangfu, encountered a desperate counterattack by over a thousand Japanese troops. The Chinese army lured them into the mountains and surrounded them on three sides, killing over half of the Japanese troops, and recovered several important Japanese strongholds. In addition, over a thousand Japanese troops in Nanchang, starting on the morning of the 4th, launched a fierce counterattack on Wuxi City under the cover of airplanes and poison gas. After bravely resisting, the Japanese army eventually faltered. The Chinese army launched a counterattack, and the Japanese troops suffered a great rout, abandoning over five hundred corpses. The Chinese army pursued triumphantly, recovering the strongholds of Hehu and Zhoucun. They are currently attacking the Japanese army to the south.

(Shanxi-Henan Front): The Japanese troops in Changzhi, Changzi, and Huguan in southeastern Shanxi have suffered extremely heavy casualties under the continuous fierce attacks of the Chinese army. Over three thousand Japanese troops in Changzi launched a large-scale harassment in three routes. One route, with over a thousand troops and three to four cannons, harassed Yanglu Village. Another route, with over a thousand troops and four to five cannons, invaded Nanyao in the east. Another route, with six to seven hundred troops, invaded Zhangdian Town in the south. Another route, with over two hundred troops and multiple tanks, invaded Baodian in the north. In addition, over two thousand Japanese troops south of Changzhi, with five cannons, under the cover of Japanese aircraft, also simultaneously invaded south along multiple routes. The Chinese army launched attacks along separate routes, causing the Japanese to suffer heavy losses. At the same time, over eight hundred Japanese troops in Huguan also invaded Shijia Gou in the south, but were intercepted by the Chinese army. The Japanese army fled in panic. The Chinese army pursued triumphantly and immediately recovered Qinzhuang and the east and south passes of Huguan. Fierce street fighting is still underway. Over two hundred Japanese troops in Zhangcun in southern Shanxi invaded Donghuangcaopi on the 5th and were surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army. Subsequently, over four hundred Japanese reinforcements were also repelled by the Chinese army. Over two hundred Japanese troops in Heilongguan in western Shanxi invaded Puxian on the 7th without success. On the 8th, they still advanced on Xiangning from Fencheng and Xinlu with over a thousand reinforcements, attempting to coordinate their actions, but were blocked by the Chinese near Guanwang Temple, inflicting heavy casualties. The Japanese troops in Wuyang in northern Henan, after being shelled by the Chinese and losing over a hundred men including the Japanese Deputy Commander Suzuki, gathered over a thousand men and multiple tanks and invaded Jingming Village and other places. After a bloody battle throughout the night, they were finally repelled by the Chinese army. On the 6th, over seven hundred Japanese troops invaded Chongyi and Baixiang in the west and were again repelled. The Japanese suffered extremely heavy casualties. The situation has now gradually become quiet.

(Guangdong-Fujian Front): In the southern Guangdong province, after the Chinese army killed the Japanese commander Colonel Kawayama on the Xinhe Road, the Japanese troops in Jiangmen re-attacked Duruan on the 6th. They were resolutely resisted by the Chinese army. Although the Japanese repeatedly sent reinforcements, they were all repelled. The Japanese troops in Da and Xiao Meishan in Xinhui also launched a third invasion of Liantang, but were also repelled by the Chinese army. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to attack and recovered Da and Xiao Meishan on the 8th. The Japanese troops attacking Shiqi, with their superior naval, land, and air forces, launched fierce attacks for days, but were resolutely resisted by the Chinese army, inflicting extremely heavy casualties. On the evening of the 7th, the Japanese sent reinforcements and launched a fierce attack. The Chinese army fought a bloody battle until the morning of the 8th and were still engaged in fierce fighting near Shiqi. After the Chinese army in the east once recovered Shenzhen last week, the Japanese troops sent reinforcements for days. On the morning of the 4th, the Chinese army attacked Chalan, surrounding the Japanese. Multiple Japanese motorboats, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, attempted to land at Xianan to send reinforcements, but were repelled by the Chinese. The Japanese then landed at Xiangnan. The Chinese lured the Japanese deep into the area and ambushed them on three sides, killing countless Japanese. The Japanese retreated in disarray to Shilong. Lülan was immediately recovered. As for Chaoshan, the Japanese once crossed the river from Leishi to the west on the 3rd, but were fiercely attacked by the Chinese, suffering extremely heavy casualties. Less than one-third of them fled to the east bank. After Meizhou Island in Fujian Province was recovered by the Chinese last week, four Japanese warships and multiple motorboats attempted to land and wreak havoc on the 4th. The Chinese garrison immediately launched a fierce attack, and they fled back to the Japanese warships in panic, launching blind shelling on the island for days. The Chinese suffered no damage. In addition, in the great victory in western Hebei, over two thousand members of the Mizuhara Brigade, who invaded Lingshou Wangchenzhuang, were completely annihilated, and Yixian, Centang, and Huzhen were recovered. In southern Hebei, Nanxun was recovered again, and many spoils of war were obtained. South of Feixian in southern Shandong, after three days and nights of bloody fighting, over a thousand Japanese troops were killed. In northern Jiangsu, Huaian was besieged. In the south of the Yangtze River, Xishi (near Wujin) was recovered. The Shanghai-Hangzhou line advanced on Fengjing and Jiashan, capturing countless spoils of war. These are all important war results of the past week and are reported here as an attachment. (12th dispatch)

### The Vigor of Yuanling, Hunan

The Political Center During the War of Resistance, All United to Work Hard for the War Effort

"The people of Hunan have a strong personality." Everyone has a very deep impression of this sentence. Since the Chinese army withdrew from Wuhan and Nanchang, although Changsha, the provincial capital, was close to the front line, the Chinese soldiers, with the advantages of the people of Hunan and the terrain, still continued to counterattack at all times. However, in order to avoid unnecessary threats and to better support the fighting at the front, the political center of Hunan was moved from Changsha to Yuanling.

The center of western Hunan has an old city. The Yuan River, which originates from the Qingshui River in Tianzhu, Guizhou, flows through Chenxi, then northeast, and then into Dongting Lake. This ancient city faces the riverbank. She is Yuanling, the gateway to western Hunan.

Yuanling is an important town in western Hunan. She can not only control western Hunan, but also control southern Hunan. Even if the Japanese were to open up the Yuehan Railway Line, she could still call for the battle of Hunan. A beautiful place, her back is against the verdant mountains, and her front faces the green water. The quiet mountains, accompanied by the rolling water, and set off by this plain ancient city, are full of suppressed enthusiasm. It is really beautiful.

In August of this year, Yuanling suffered the most tragic bombing by Japanese planes. Three-fifths of the only street in the city was bombed away, and more than 700 people were killed or injured. However, when the Japanese planes had not yet flown far away, groups of heroic rescue workers were seen quickly digging, rescuing, and providing medical assistance at the tragic fire and bombing site. Now, these ruins have been quickly reborn. Using broken walls and ruins, wooden frames were erected, and simple buildings have appeared one by one. This is a manifestation of the spirit of Hunan people who are not afraid of bombing and are calm and striving.

The people of Yuanling have the strong traditions of the people of Hunan. Especially the working women, barefoot and in straw sandals, carrying heavy loads, have replaced many of the things that men should do. Just take a look, and you can see their disaster-stricken footprints in every corner. This simple and arduous life will definitely shatter your long-held notion that the lives of women are weak and decadent.

The national consciousness of the people is quite high. This should be attributed to the strict organization of the Baojia system. A friend once talked to an old woman about the conscription issue. She said, "That's right, if we don't resist, China will perish, so I am willing to let my son go to be a soldier." The common people are the most lovable and respectable. They are simple and strong. They only need a little white rice and pickled vegetables, and they can live happily every day. They know how to love their country and how to save their country. "The entire city of Yuanling is full of the life of resistance." This is not an exaggeration. Indeed, the people who grow up inside are so energetic and spirited. Political workers are stepping up their work, and salvation groups are also engaging in more intense activities. No one is not standing more solemnly at their posts, performing their duties.

(9) The Ministry of Education shall send personnel to various organs and schools at any time to check the disaster relief items, existing surplus property, etc. The committee members will not notify in advance when they are sent out, and will immediately carry out the inspection task upon arrival.

For all the major subjects in each college and department, appropriate topics are selected, and at least one session must be held every month. Now, it has been ordered to add wartime lectures and current affairs discussion meetings. The time, location, and topics of the meetings are announced to the public in advance and notified to schools at all levels. The second is the Mass Literacy Movement, which is jointly planned and promoted by teachers and students together with relevant local agencies to enable the general public to become literate and eliminate illiteracy. The third is the Mass Reading Material Editing Group, which aims to instill basic literacy knowledge in the masses and arouse patriotic enthusiasm and stimulate anti-Japanese sentiment. It is currently planning to edit books such as the National Thousand Character Primer, A Simple Explanation of Chinese History and Geography, A History of Foreign Aggression Against China, and Anti-Japanese Novels. In the future, if it can be approved to issue printing paper and expenses, it will edit and publish them according to the plan and distribute them for reading.

After the supplementary classes are completed, they will continue to be run. The fifth is the Cooperative Guidance Group. In order to answer inquiries from all parties regarding cooperation issues, a cooperative problem consultation office has been specially established. If members of the public have any inquiries regarding cooperation matters, they can raise them and discuss them at any time. The sixth is the Mass Legal Advisory Group. In order to popularize legal awareness among the masses, a mass legal advisory room has been specially established. If there are concrete facts that require legal solutions, or if there are doubts about the current laws and regulations, the main points of the questions can be clarified and the Mass Legal Advisory Office can be requested to answer them. The seventh is the Local Autonomy Guidance Group, which aims to assist local autonomy organs in studying and promoting autonomy matters. The eighth is the Air Defense and Poison Gas Training Group, which plans to formulate publicity methods for air defense and poison gas issues and set dates for publicity.

### Finance Speculators Profiting from Public Bonds Turn to Gold Market; 4,000 Yuan Barrier Once Broken Through

Yesterday's spot gold dark market was vibrant and suddenly turned for the better. Although Hong Kong banks did not need to increase their supply, many local speculators had profited from public bonds and turned to the gold market. Furthermore, because the recent atmosphere of peace had completely vanished, the market opened with a jump of 55 yuan, reaching 3,995 yuan. The news of the occupation of the Bank of Communications on the Bund also had an impact. Subsequently, due to the weakening of foreign exchange, money changers forcefully pushed the price up for local banks, and it surged to a high of 4,020 yuan. The situation was tense, but the good times did not last. Foreign exchange suddenly reported to be firming up, and pawnshops and gold shops sold off repeatedly, causing the price to repeatedly fluctuate around the 4,000 yuan mark and the low price of 3,965 yuan. Extending to the evening close, there were still Hong Kong banks and securities firms buying in, and it finally closed a huge 48 yuan higher than the previous day. Trading was still brisk, with about 1,200 taels traded. Jewelry gold also rose by 5 yuan, while customs gold remained stable as before.

Sudden Reversal of Spot Gold

Since the morning, every bar (ten taels) initially opened with news of tight foreign exchange and the alleged occupation of the Bank of Communications on the Bund. Market sentiment was firm, and there were calls to buy everywhere. Sellers took the opportunity to raise prices quite aggressively. The market opening jumped by 55 yuan. Securities firms bought 20 taels of gold from gold shops at 3,950 yuan, and then raised the price by another 5 yuan. Securities firms bought 10 taels from money changers, calling for 1,000 yuan. At that time, pawnshops forced to sell more than 100 taels, and the upward trend was stopped immediately, and fell back by a little bit to 10 yuan. Pawnshops and money changers sold a total of 30 taels to securities firms, with prices all at 3,990 yuan. After that, a certain money changer bought on behalf of a customer, and because foreign exchange still reported to be weakening, the trend was firm again. Soon the price rose by 20 yuan, with gold shops trading 20 taels with each other at 4,020 yuan. Later, because foreign exchange changed from tight to firm, it triggered a wave of selling. A certain money changer sold heavily on behalf of Rong Meng, and retail investors also supplied more than was demanded. The market trend suddenly turned downwards, and actually fell back by 35 yuan. Securities firms sold 30 taels to money changers at 3,975 yuan. Later, because gold shops pulled up the price, it once again reached 3,985 yuan. However, securities firms and pawnshops came again to sell, and it fell another 20 yuan. Pawnshops bought 20 taels from money changers, with the price at 3,965 yuan. Near noon, a certain gold shop took advantage of the low price to replenish its stock, and money changers' buying interest was also slightly stronger. The market trend stabilized, and soon rose by 20 yuan. Money changers bought 20 taels from gold shops at 3,985 yuan. Later, another money changer sold 10 taels to pawnshops at 3,980 yuan, as the closing price for the noon session. The afternoon market opened firmly, rising by 10 yuan. Money changers bought 30 taels from gold shops at 3,990 yuan. At that time, because foreign exchange was strengthening, and a certain gold shop continued to sell off, the price was pressed down by 7 yuan. Money changers sold 10 taels to pawnshops at 3,983 yuan. After that, Hong Kong banks slightly absorbed the supply, and at the same time foreign exchange turned from tight to weak again. The market image was firm, and the price immediately rose by 14 yuan. Money changers traded 20 taels with each other at 3,997 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop came to sell again, and customer banks stopped buying and observed from the sidelines. The price was pressed down by 32 yuan. A certain gold shop sold 30 taels to money changers at a price of 3,965 yuan. Later, securities firms absorbed heavily at low prices, and soon pulled up the price by 23 yuan. Gold shops bought 30 taels from money changers at 3,988 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it rose by 48 yuan compared with the previous day. It was heard that after the close, the price was raised again to 3,993 yuan, with a difference of 55 yuan for the whole day. The selling price of cash gold at gold shops was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan. The current bid gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Listed 5 Yuan Higher

The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael at pawnshops was still 400 yuan at Datong Hang. At 9:40 AM, it was listed 5 yuan higher. There were no changes after that. As a result, Datong Hang changed the listing to 405 yuan. The new firms' prices were the same as the previous price, and the purchase prices were all reduced by about 20 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Turn Strong

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a rebound. Because the foreign exchange market was absorbed successively by banks, Sassoon, and British American Tobacco Company, the market trend turned tight, and gold prices also trended upwards. At the same time, there were rumors that the United Kingdom was making concessions to Japan, so the foreign currency market turned strong. Yesterday's market results: the British gold pound rose by 1.5 yuan, the US pound rose by 1 yuan, the British gold note rose by 1 jiao, and the US gold note initially traded at 12.945 yuan, then gradually rose to about 13.3 yuan, and finally slightly retreated to 13.1 yuan.

Japanese gold notes rose slightly by 1 li, Korean notes continued to rise by 2 li, and the rest remained unchanged.

### Buying of Foreign Exchange Rises Again; British and American Exchange Rates Rebound and Tighten

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The dark market potential for British and American exchange rates suddenly turned strong and soft, a situation that was very different from before. Although the news of the Japanese occupation of the Bank of Communications on the Bund was unrelated to foreign exchange, Western merchants Sassoon and foreign firms temporarily mutually colluded, and Japanese banks also followed suit, causing the market trend to slightly tighten. The British rate was 4 pence, 59375, and the US rate was 7.6875 yuan. Subsequently, because foreign banks were profitable and exporters came to sell, the price eased slightly once. Because people's minds were uncertain, most people held a wait-and-see attitude, so until the early opening of the afternoon, the market remained stable. However, there were further rumors that the occupation of the Bank of Communications was intended to be used as the location of a certain bank, so the buying spree rose again. Chinese banks and British American Tobacco Company came to settle, and it was heard that Tianjin banks were also secretly buying. By the time the market closed, the price had tightened to British exchange 4 pence, 625, and US exchange 7.75 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British rate was 0.0625 tighter, and the US rate was 0.125 softer. As for the futures trend, it was the same as the spot market. Trading was average throughout the day.

Sassoon and Chinese Merchants Successively Absorb

In the early morning, because London's big transactions, both near and far term, were long by half a penny, New York silver prices, and US foreign exchange rates, were closed due to the Columbus Day holiday, London's raw gold was stable, and the exchange rate of British to US and to France was flat, to Shanghai by 125. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' morning opening spot selling price was British gold 4 pence, 6875, and US exchange 7.875, with no increase or decrease compared to the previous close. After opening, because Western merchant Sassoon aggressively bought and foreign firms also settled, and it was heard that Japanese banks were also operating from the middle, the market situation suddenly tightened and softened. Sassoon and foreign firms bought spot British gold 4 pence, 65625 and 625, and spot US exchange 7.8125 and 75 from foreign banks. HSBC's listing was announced to be untouched, and the white silver equilibrium tax was announced to be large by 2 fen 75. Later, Chinese merchants settled and bought this month's US exchange 7.6875 from a certain bank. Later, the tightest spot British gold was once called 4 pence, 59375, and US exchange was also called 7.6875. Later, the buying spree slightly stopped, and the British bank came to sell heavily for profit, and exporters also sold, so the situation returned to flat. The profitable and exporters sold spot British gold 4 pence, 625 and 65625, and spot US exchange 7.75 and 8125 to foreign banks and Huabi. Later, a certain bank sold spot US exchange 7.75 to foreign merchants. Extending to the noon close, the banks' spot selling price was British gold 4 pence, 65625, and US exchange 7.8125, slightly tighter than the morning opening British by 0.03125 and slightly softer than the US by 0.0625.

British American Tobacco Company Also Settles

The afternoon market opened stably, and Profit sold spot British gold 4 pence, 6875 to its counterparts. Later, because Chinese banks came to buy, and British American Tobacco Company also settled, and it was rumored that Tianjin banks also came to buy, the situation slightly tightened and softened. The Chinese banks and British American Tobacco Company successively settled and bought spot British gold 4 pence, 65625 and 625, and spot US exchange 7.8125 and 75 from HSBC Datong and a certain bank. Later, Chinese merchants also bought October's US exchange 7.75 from a certain bank.

### Securities Bond Market Changes Three Times a Day; Trading of Foreign Stocks Still Brisk

Yesterday's securities dark market continued to trend downwards. Although various parties tried their best to pull up the price, their strength was weak, and it eventually went downstream. Observing the battle lines of the bulls and bears in the market, their strengths were evenly matched. Judging from the chips, there was indeed a sign of exhaustion. Judging from the morale, a sign of fatigue was already visible. In the future, there should still be larger ups and downs following changes in the environment. In the early opening yesterday morning, there were rumors in this port, and the market price immediately fell by 5 or 6 jiao. Later, the bulls rose again to pull up the price, and actually exceeded the previous day's market closing price. However, those who seized the opportunity to sell sold off at high prices, so in the afternoon, the market price suddenly broke through the 70 yuan barrier due to the selling of the 20th and 13th bonds. The market price changed three times a day. As a result, except for the A bonds, which had no increase or decrease, the rest continued to decrease by a small 2 or 3 jiao. The total number of transactions was estimated to be around 800,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

### Yarn and Cotton The Bullish Intention Changes; Yarn Market Re-enters Sluggishness

The yarn market, which rebounded the previous day, was weak again yesterday and went down, re-entering sluggishness. In fact, spot sales were weak, and with the control of exchange rates in South China, silver could not be remitted in large quantities, so purchasing power was greatly reduced. Secondly, recently new cotton arrivals have been crowded, people are looking tired, and most are watching and waiting. Therefore, they are hesitant and uncertain. According to market rumors, a certain Feng has always been close to a certain large factory, and the amount purchased can be said to be unique in the current market. Recently, for some unknown reason, the intention has changed, and they are selling one after another every day. One theory is that they have absorbed too many packages and are temporarily giving up one step, waiting for an opportunity to decide the outcome.

The opening price of spot yarn in the morning was very high. However, there was a lack of customers, and the personnel were chaotic and dispersed, which showed that the market situation was weak and lacked strength. It was not until 9:50 AM that the price was opened. 20-count Shuangma remained unchanged at 725 yuan. After a while, there were few buyers, and the selling momentum suddenly increased, so it gradually decreased to 712 yuan. Soon, the buying spree rose slightly, and it rebounded again. In the end, the bulls sold off, and it decreased again. The current selling price of 20-count Shuangma is 716.5 yuan. It was found that 1,150 bales were traded in the half day. The market price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 5.5 yuan. Tiannv changed to the earth, all unchanged. The amount of each bank's purchase is listed on the left.

### Raw Cotton Factory Purchases Slightly Decline; Tong Cotton is Relatively Lively

Raw cotton trading was still lively, but slightly less than the previous day. However, for the Tong cotton item, although the arrival of goods was crowded, the demand from factories and counterparts was increasingly developed, so the market price was still flat. British Tongyi Factory imported 1,500 bales of Tongzhou cotton, and Japanese Gongda imported 100 pieces of foreign cotton. There were no other purchases. The source of Subei cotton is still continuous. 3,433 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived, and 65 bales came from Beisha. The current raw cotton situation is listed on the left.

Tongzhou 134.0 Counterpart 200 bales

Also 133.0 Also 500 bales

Also 134.0 Also 500 bales

Also 131.0 Also 200 bales

Also 139.0 Tongyi 1,500 bales

Argentina 186.0 Gongda 100 pieces

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been affected by the relatively loose exchange rate in recent days. Factories have adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards the purchase of raw cotton. Therefore, the market transaction is quite quiet. Brazilian cotton is still being inquired about, but the selling price is only around 170 yuan. Counterparts are also quite indifferent to the purchase of new American cotton, so no one has inquired about it so far.

Foreign cotton market prices, New York cotton market, yesterday, Columbus Day, the United States was closed for one day, so there was no cotton market. However, according to a telegram from a certain cotton firm, it is predicted that the cotton market will open flat today. The Indian cotton market is very firm. Yesterday, it rose another rupee or so along with the prediction. Egypt rose 7 pounds, and Liverpool rose 2 pence.

### Grain Spreading Rumors; Customer Demand Rises Again

Since the customer demand for japonica rice turned tight the previous day, sellers were creating an atmosphere again yesterday morning, spreading rumors that the source of customer demand was likely to be interrupted again in the near future, and that no more shipments would arrive. Those who had goods on hand took the opportunity to hoard them, so the initial price of Nanjing, Wuhu, and Jiangbei rice was uniformly raised by about half a yuan. At the same time, in addition to local merchants taking advantage of the trend to grab market share, there were also mainland banks that smoothly bought Jiangbei rice. The market situation was anxious, and the market price rose steadily all the way. By the close, it had increased by more than 1 yuan compared to the previous day. For example, Jiangbei rice was 19 yuan, followed by 18.3 yuan, Nanjing Nanguan Special Grade 1 was 20 yuan, high at 19.8 yuan, Grade 2 city rice was 19.4 yuan, 19.2 yuan, and Grade 3 was 18.8 yuan, 18.5 yuan. Wuhu Special rice was 19.8 yuan, 19.5 yuan, city rice was 19.2 yuan, 19 yuan, and followed by 18.5 yuan, Shi rice was 17.5 yuan, 17.2 yuan. Coarse rice also added half a yuan. High Special was 16.5 yuan, and city rice was 16.2 yuan. As for broken japonica rice and new japonica rice such as Yaoyaozhong Baige and Yanglu rice, although the local sales market was also active, the source was continuous, and the market goods were abundant, so although the merchants tried their best to raise the price, they could not violate the facts in the end. As a result, the market was just a fixed game, and there was a lack of increase or decrease. Ru Changxi broken japonica rice was still 32 or 3 yuan, medium was 30 yuan, new japonica rice was 18 yuan, Su Tong Kun broken was 30 yuan, followed by 28.8 yuan, new japonica rice was high at 27.5 yuan, followed by 26.5 yuan, Qingjiao Yaoyaozhong was 29 yuan, Fengjia Baige city had no high goods, only opened the market for 27.5 yuan, followed by 26.5 yuan, Nangang white rice was high at 28 yuan, city was 27 yuan, Yang rice Special was 23 yuan, followed by 21 yuan, Wu rice Special was 23.5 yuan, followed by 12 yuan, and deteriorated old goods were also unchanged, still 31 or 2 yuan, followed by 30 yuan. New goods were not selling well, and the situation was flat and tired. The opening price was 26.5 yuan, 26 yuan. According to statistics, only 4,500 bags of new goods such as Su Kun Qingjiao Fengjia were transported to the city by the Donglun, and it was also heard that there was a shortage of goods in Hexia. The number of transactions in the city was no less than 12,000 bags.

After the continuous decline in customer demand for indica rice, various households in the local township and streets have been absorbing it at low prices in the past two or three days. Yesterday, even large households selected more than 3,000 bags of low-priced medium and low-quality goods. Including scattered calculations, there were as many as seven or eight thousand bags traded. And the source is that traders are watching and waiting, but it has been reduced. Even if the goods arrive in Shanghai, they are mostly held firmly in the warehouses. Therefore, the market suddenly became tense. The price of medium and low-quality goods immediately increased by 7 or 8 jiao, and the price of high-quality goods rose by about half a yuan. As for the rumor in the market that there was a problem with the Jiangbei purchase certificate, and the opening of Wuhu rice, both have not been fully confirmed.

### Sharp Reduction in Flour Transactions; Sellers' Mentality Turns Firm

The flour market is on the rise, with small quantities of goods going to Qingdao, Xiamen, and the inland areas of this street. The supply of returned goods in the market is becoming increasingly scarce. Except for those that have been transferred to warehouses, most of the factory warehouses have already been sold out, so the sellers' minds are gradually firm, and the market follows suit. Yesterday, transactions were sharply reduced. Only the Bingchuan brand transferred goods at 6.85 yuan. The old Che brand and the Honglanfu new brand have already been keeping pace with the factory's market, and the factory goods are taking advantage of this to hoard goods and are unwilling to supply them in large quantities.

Wheat has been unremarkable for a long time. Since the price of flour has risen, the market price of raw materials has been brought up invisibly. However, the factory's demand is not strong, and the owners insist, resulting in a stalemate in the market. Yesterday, the flour market was doing well, and the factory's stockpiles were still being digested. However, the goods side was trying to raise the price, so in the end, the factory only imported one cart of Suzhou wheat, and the stockpilers bought two carts of Kunshan wheat. The market price was clearly stable but secretly firm.

### Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Still Scarce; Wholesale Transactions

The selling price of domestic cloth continued to decline. White goods such as fine twill and fine cloth fell by 2 or 3 jiao per piece. The opening price of coarse cloth was 9 to 16 pounds, and each weight fell by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao per piece. The price of Yihua 13.14 pounds was relatively stable. Yihua 9 pounds of coarse cloth fell to 14.55 yuan in the morning, and then turned to 14.7 yuan. The opening price of bleached and dyed cloth was generally loose, and the price was about 2 or 3 jiao per piece. There was still a lack of wholesale transactions for customer sales. The Guangdong banks purchased more than 3,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, serge, and woolen cloth. Zhejiang Dong Ningbo Jinhua and other places purchased more than 100 packages of coarse cloth, and more than 30 boxes of blue cloth, colored twill, flannel, and corduroy. The wholesale shops in this street had more demand, purchasing nearly 200 packages of coarse cloth from Yihua and other factories, and four or five thousand pieces of flannel, colored cloth, and bleached cloth. Hong Jingguang Woolen Cloth Factory opened nearly 200 boxes of goods for this month, and the price was 7.5 jiao per yard.

The actual sales of white goods in Dongpi were still sluggish, and the market atmosphere was sluggish. The opening price of Longtou fine cloth in the morning fell to 20.075 yuan, and the market price was slightly higher at 21 yuan. The price of middle and lower-end brands such as Laba, Wufu, and Lanji fell by another 2 or 3 jiao per piece. Yesterday, the low-end selling price of colored goods such as Four Gentlemen Serge opened at 6.55 jiao per yard, and then rebounded to 6.65 jiao. Customer sales only involved Tianjin banks purchasing two or three hundred pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, and serge. The intention of this street was still weak. The firms opened a small amount of Longtou fine cloth for this month, dozens of packages, and the price was 21.25 yuan per piece.

Exports On the 14th, 105 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, and 50 pieces were shipped to Singapore.

### Silk and Tea Japanese Silk Still Expensive

Yesterday, New York was closed for the holidays, and the Yokohama silk market was getting better. The spot price was 1670 yuan, up 15 yuan, and the forward price was up 24 yuan to 1594 yuan. In the afternoon, the closing price of the near-term and forward prices rose again, with the spot price at 1675 yuan, the near-term price at 1678 yuan, and the forward price at 1609 yuan. It is estimated that the near-term and forward prices have all jumped out of the 1600 yuan line, an increase of about 70 yuan compared to the beginning of the month.

The silk market in this port was very firm, but it has shown signs of being unsustainable due to the influence of exchange rates in recent days. Various silks below 78 points in the white factory have fallen into the 4000 yuan range. Ji Li Jing is relatively stable because of the lack of inventory. Yesterday, Da Xin imported 110 dans of Ji Li in the white factory, and the price was based on the market price.

Untreated Male Weakness Inevitably Leads to Major Hidden Concerns

When a man is physically weak and without hope of regaining his health, he will feel that the whole world has turned gray. He envies the joy of others, and his heart is filled with endless sorrow! At this time, even a beautiful wife and concubines are not enough to comfort his heart; even his children in swaddling clothes will be pinned with distant hopes. However, a weak husband often finds it difficult to have children. Thus, he is as empty as a soap bubble, floating vaguely in the air, and vanishing in an instant!

A real man should be as strong and vigorous as a lively dragon and a fierce tiger, with abundant thoughts and vigorous energy, striving for achievement in everything he does. Only then can he be a stabilizing force in the family and a pillar of society and the nation. But why is his body so weak now? According to medical diagnosis, the majority must be due to early indulgence in masturbation and seminal emission, or premature marriage and excessive lust, which deplete the vital reproductive gland fluid, resulting in brainpower decline, poor memory, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, premature aging, and other symptoms too numerous to mention. Thus, his appearance becomes withered, his ambition declines, and he is listless and unable to perform tasks all day long. In the sexual life that forms the foundation of the couple, the happiness that life should enjoy often vanishes like a bubble, or he may even be completely impotent, wasting his own and his wife's precious youth. This is indeed a helpless situation for the man, but how can the wife willingly endure it? Therefore, tragedies such as elopement, suicide, separation, and divorce between couples often occur in society. The loneliness and suffering of a widow and orphaned children left behind by a husband's early death are even more tragic!

Today, with the advancement of medicine and the omnipotence of science, physical weakness can be restored to strength through tonification. The above-mentioned symptoms can be radically cured in a short period with special treatments. What are these special treatments? They are the reproductive gland supplementation therapies invented by the world's medical sage, Dr. Stan Nah, after more than 30 years of arduous experimentation. The method extracts reproductive gland hormones from strong animals such as gorillas, monkeys, bears, deer, and sea dogs, and uses a concentrated replication method to produce tablets. Simply put, it is a reproductive gland hormone preparation called "Reproductive Hormone." It is the most nourishing oral medicine. Patients can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, invigorate blood, and nourish the nerves within a day and night after taking it. Continued use can promote development and adjust metabolism, and it is bound to radically cure various symptoms in a short period. Regular use can also achieve the effects of prolonging life and rejuvenating youth. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Himilto's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" to stop the leakage and achieve rapid results! Since the advancement of endocrinology, most famous Chinese and foreign doctors have adopted this method and consider it the most effective. I have used this method to cure tens of thousands of patients. Recently, Mr. Hu Yihua suffered from severe brain weakness and kidney deficiency, accompanied by seminal emission. He took various tonics on the market, but they had no effect, like throwing stones into the water. Last month, Mr. Hu came to my clinic for treatment. After examining his condition, I instructed him to purchase half a dozen "Reproductive Hormone" and three boxes of "Himilto's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" from the Sino-Western Pharmacy and take both together. In just one month, all his ailments disappeared, and his energy became abundant. Not only did his work efficiency double, but the love between him and his wife became extremely strong!

### The Only Treatment for Seminal Emission Patients

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

"One wrong step leads to eternal regret" is no longer suitable for the times in this era of scientific omnipotence, where there are ways to remedy everything. However, "taking a wrong step" is always quite dangerous, and it is best not to take one at all. It is true that young people have weak wills and insufficient rationality, and are easily tempted by adverse environments. Therefore, young people must be careful in making friends, and obscene books and magazines must not be read. Entertainment venues with low-grade interests should not be frequented. Because these places are most likely to arouse lust, and countless people commit the evil habit of masturbation or engage in homosexual relationships when lust is strong and their desires are not fulfilled. It should be known that unreasonable sexual behaviors such as masturbation, excessive lust, or premature marriage and debauchery are most likely to damage the sexual nerves, loosen the seminal vesicle, and trigger the terrible seminal emission syndrome!

Although seminal emission is a common occurrence for every unmarried young man, some experience it once or twice a month or every few months due to the excessive accumulation of semen produced physiologically. This is a physiological overflowing of semen in healthy men due to late marriage or long separation from their wives. If there is no fatigue or dizziness after the emission, it does not harm health. However, if seminal emission occurs two or three times or more within a month, and the person feels mentally fatigued and drowsy after the emission, this is undoubtedly a pathological seminal emission. Those with this symptom must be treated as early as possible. Then there will be no major harm. If the treatment is delayed and neglected, light nocturnal emission may progress to severe spermatorrhea and semen leakage. There are also many cases where prolonged seminal emission leads to sperm exhaustion and blood depletion, resulting in brain weakness, insomnia, poor memory, disturbed dreams, daytime fatigue and listlessness, back pain, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and premature aging. How can such young people continue their studies and concentrate on their careers? Unmarried men will be abandoned by women, and married men will be hated by their wives. Thus, the future is bleak, and happiness is lost! Seminal emission is not an incurable disease. Why do you harm yourself and others to this extent! Regarding the treatment of seminal emission, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Himilto's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" is the only effective treatment. This medicine can consolidate the seminal vesicle and calm the nerves. It can achieve the magical effect of promoting sleep and stopping seminal emission on the same night after taking it. If the above-mentioned symptoms have already occurred due to seminal emission, you must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" to nourish the brain, kidneys, sperm, blood, and nerves. Continued use can radically cure various symptoms in a short period. If you can come to this clinic for combined treatment with electrotherapy and injections, the results will be faster!

Beauty and Health

### Breasts Should Match Clothing

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Although it is said that "three points of talent depend on seven points of dress," it is ultimately not very appropriate to "dress up a goose's head on a duck's neck." A thin girl with breasts as withered as those of an undeveloped child, without any curves in her figure, and with a sallow or pale face devoid of any rosy complexion, will only accentuate her ugliness even if she wears brocade and silk and is covered in makeup. Because men of the times have long emphasized healthy beauty in their aesthetic views of women. Therefore, a woman's beauty is entirely based on health. If a woman's breasts are well-developed, it proves that her ovarian function is healthy and that she has no hidden ailments such as irregular menstruation or leucorrhea, and is not infertile. Therefore, her blood is naturally abundant, her figure is slender, her face is rosy and lovely, and her temperament is cheerful and lively. If such a girl wears fashionable clothes, she will be beautiful and moving even without makeup. Men will see such women as angels in their hearts, and there will be those who admire them from the sidelines, and those who are determined to pursue and fall at their feet. If a good match is made, and she marries her ideal husband, the love after marriage will be strong, and she will bear clever children, forming a happy family, and life will be so happy! However, why are many women's breasts withered and their faces aging? This is mostly due to hidden ailments that damage the ovarian function. Any woman who wants to turn weakness into strength and ugliness into beauty must nourish her ovarian function and eradicate her hidden ailments. The gynecological medicine recognized by world-renowned doctors, the ovarian preparation "Reproductive Hormone" for women, is the most suitable medicine for the above-mentioned needs. After taking it, women can regulate menstruation, stop leucorrhea, and nourish ovarian function. Continued use will radically cure various hidden ailments, making the breasts firm and the cheeks rosy, enhancing health and beauty. Based on my years of experience, I have used this medicine and obtained satisfactory results in tens of thousands of cases.

### Former Site of the Bank of Communications Suddenly Seized by Japanese Military Police; Claiming Intention to Establish a Military Police Office; Concession Authorities Are Negotiating

The former site of the Bank of Communications on Hankou Road on the Bund was suddenly invaded and forcibly occupied by a large number of Japanese plainclothes personnel at 5:00 AM yesterday morning. Although negotiations took place, they had not withdrawn by late evening, claiming that they were officers of the Japanese Military Police and would use the site to establish a branch office of the Military Police Headquarters in the concession. This action is being taken very seriously by all parties. As of late last night, the legal issues regarding the Japanese Military Police personnel's forcible occupation of the building were still unclear. The Municipal Council Police stated that they had not received a formal report from the bank. However, reporters learned that the bank had sent an employee to visit Mr. Hodekui, Deputy Director of the Municipal Council, yesterday morning. Mr. Philippe, Director and President of the Municipal Council, told reporters, "I have not received a detailed report on this matter and regret that I cannot provide information. The Japanese side did not formally notify us beforehand, nor did they explain anything to the Municipal Council afterward." Furthermore, in last night's Japanese news reports, Western reporters asked the Japanese spokesman about this matter. The Japanese spokesman hesitated for two minutes before replying, "We have not received any information." As of late last night, except for the bank's employees, everyone was prohibited from entering and exiting. According to reliable sources, they are conducting a cleaning inside the building. When police detectives arrived at the bank to investigate yesterday morning, the Japanese side claimed that the bank was the property of the Chinese government and that the Japanese Military Police intended to use it as barracks. The details are recorded below:

Did Not Notify Concession Authorities

The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that twenty armed Japanese in plainclothes, without notifying the Municipal Council Police Department or the British Army, forcibly entered the Bank of Communications at the corner of Hankou Road and the Bund in the British defense zone at 5:00 AM this morning (13th) and seized it. The Japanese then claimed that they belonged to the Shanghai Japanese Military Police Headquarters and wanted to use the building to establish a Military Police Department in the International Settlement. When these Japanese entered the building, they extorted keys from the few doormen and servants. Some of the Japanese rushed to the fourth floor, where the bank's employee training center in the occupied area was located, and began to move away furniture and stationery. Others stayed in the cafeteria and storage area on the third floor. As of press time, the Japanese were still in the building and prohibiting employees from entering.

Branches Withdraw, Operations Suspended

It was learned that at 4:00 PM yesterday (12th), two Japanese in plainclothes claiming to be representatives of the Japanese Military Police visited the Bank of Communications and said they wanted to rent part of the building as an office. The employees informed them that the building was completely occupied by employees from the occupied areas and that there were no vacant rooms. The two Japanese inspected the building for a week, paying special attention to the employee training center on the fourth floor, and left one hour later. As a result of the building's occupation, the Bank of Communications has announced that all branches withdrawing to Shanghai from the occupied areas will be evacuated and operations will be suspended for two days.

Secret Reconnaissance the Day Before Yesterday

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Shanghai Bank of Communications has moved to 891 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. The building at 10 Hankou Road in the International Settlement was converted into temporary communication offices for the bank's three branches in the occupied areas of Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Zhenjiang. The third floor was used as a cafeteria and storage area, and an employee training center for the occupied areas was set up on the fourth floor. At 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, two Japanese in plainclothes suddenly went to the Bank of Communications on Hankou Road and requested to meet with the manager. The bank sent an employee to meet them. The Japanese claimed to be representatives of the Japanese Military Police Headquarters and wanted to rent a room in the building as an office. The Bank of Communications staff immediately informed them that there were no vacant rooms and politely declined. The two Japanese then patrolled the building for a week, paying special attention to the employee training center on the fourth floor, and then left. No one expected the events of yesterday morning to occur.

Sneaked into the Building Before Dawn Yesterday

At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, an unknown person suddenly sneaked into the alley next to the side door of the Bank of Communications building at 10 Hankou Road, taking advantage of the garbage truck entering the alley. The watchman and inspector discovered this and took him to the bank's security room. When questioned about the reason for invading the building at night, it was learned that he was Japanese. According to the Japanese, he wanted to borrow a room to look at the building. The inspector refused. However, the Japanese insisted on staying. The inspector had no way to deal with the situation temporarily and waited until dawn to ask the bank for instructions.

More Than Twenty People Armed and Occupied

Before the first wave subsided, a huge wave followed. At 5:00 AM, another twenty Japanese plainclothes personnel, some fully armed, arrived in three cars with Shanghai Concession Defense Force certificates numbers 164, 209, and 381, and one car with Concession black license plate number 5439. They drove directly to the entrance of the bank's building on Hankou Road and stopped. They claimed to be personnel from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters and forced the doormen, inspectors, and bank employees to hand over the keys, opened the gate, and rushed straight to the employee training center of the bank's occupied areas on the fourth floor, removing the furniture and documents, and forcibly occupying it. Another group of Japanese did the same in the bank's cafeteria and furniture storage room on the third floor.

Sawed Off Door Locks, Detained Inspectors

According to rumors from neighbors around the Bank of Communications building on Hankou Road, the large number of Japanese plainclothes armed personnel who invaded the Bank of Communications sawed off the door locks with a hacksaw before rushing in. However, this statement has not yet been confirmed. After they invaded the building, they monitored the inspectors and restricted their freedom of movement. When it was already dawn, the inspector thought of a plan and told the Japanese that he was due to leave work and had to return home. After repeated requests, the Japanese agreed, and he managed to escape. He rushed to the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road to report everything that had happened.

Police Negotiations Still Unsuccessful

After receiving the report, the police immediately dispatched several Western detectives and Japanese detectives and drove there in police cars. Negotiations failed. At around 8:00 AM, Mr. Robertson, District Chief of the Central Police Station, and a senior Western officer from the Political Department of the Police Department also went to the Bank of Communications on Hankou Road to negotiate with the Japanese who had invaded the building. The two sides talked for about an hour, but the Japanese still insisted on borrowing several rooms and refused to leave the building. The Public Concession Police Department immediately prepared a report and submitted it to the Municipal Council. It is said that the Municipal Council is negotiating.

Intending to Establish a Military Police Headquarters

As of yesterday afternoon, the twenty or so Japanese who had invaded were still forcibly occupying the Bank of Communications building and had sent six or seven people to guard the entrance of the building, prohibiting bank personnel from entering. What the others occupying the interior are doing is unknown. According to reliable sources, the purpose of the Japanese occupying part of the bank's building is to attempt to establish a branch office of the Military Police Headquarters in the concession. The Shanghai Bank of Communications authorities have announced that the communication offices of all banks withdrawing to Shanghai from the occupied areas will be temporarily closed for two days due to the sudden occurrence of this unfortunate event. All staff of the Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Zhenjiang communication offices of the bank and the staff and students of the employee training center in the occupied areas have temporarily withdrawn until the situation is resolved.

Recruitment Documents Lost

It is also heard that the Bank of Communications originally planned to recruit employees on the 15th of this month. Applicants were required to be university graduates. The registration documents were kept in the Bank of Communications building on Hankou Road and had not been taken out. The examination location was also in the building. Now that it has been occupied, the exam date has to be postponed. Of the four major national banks in China, three of their original sites were located on the Bund. The original site of the Central Bank is now the temporary school building of the Municipal Council Yucai Public School. The Bank of China's bank site on Hankou Road and the newly built building on Renji Road are still quiet as ever.

Bank of Communications Issues Statement

According to a public notice issued by the Shanghai Bank of Communications yesterday, "The old site of the Bank of Communications head office at 10 Hankou Road, including the first floor and lower floors, was previously designated by the Hong Kong head office as a temporary office for the various withdrawing banks in the occupied areas to handle local people's deposits. The fourth floor is currently used as an employee training class, and part of the third floor is also used by the training class. It is heard that the Japanese side sent people to the bank last night (12th) to borrow several remaining rooms upstairs for use. Because the staff in Shanghai have no right to agree, the matter has not been resolved. However, the Japanese side intends to go there for use this morning (13th) and negotiations are underway."

### US Flagship Leaves Shanghai, Destination Not Announced; Possibly Going to Sea for Target Practice; Herd Moves Office to Isabel

The "China Press" reported that the flagship Augusta of Admiral Herd, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, weighed anchor at 10:00 AM yesterday morning (12th) and sailed down the Huangpu River to the "sea." The U.S. Navy Department recently issued an order prohibiting U.S. naval officers stationed in Shanghai from disclosing the destinations of warships, so it is not known where the Augusta is going. It is likely that the ship is sailing to sea for target practice and is expected to return to Shanghai within ten days. At the same time, Admiral Herd has moved his flag and office to the U.S. ship Isabel and is remaining in Shanghai.

### Revisions to Rice Market Trading Rules; Seven Organizations Jointly Establish Conciliation Council; Shantou, Tianjin, and Yangtze Gangs Did Not Participate; Representatives of Brokers Propose Revisions to Trading Rules

Due to the surge in rice supply in recent days, rice prices have continuously declined. Most consignors are unwilling to sell because prices have fallen too drastically, so the rice price that had been falling sharply for days did not change again the day before yesterday (12th). When the rice market opened yesterday, consignors still maintained a wait-and-see attitude, while demand from buyers increased, causing the price of indica rice to rise slightly per stone. However, the price of ordinary japonica rice remained unchanged, so rice prices can be temporarily stabilized. The rice registered by consignors in the market totaled 6,711 bags.

Trading Rules Revised Yesterday

The temporary trading rules of the rice market, which were revised and passed by the joint meeting of seven organizations on the 2nd of this month, must be followed by all buyers, sellers, and intermediaries. They will be implemented from the 16th of this month. However, due to the proposal of the broker representatives, the various articles still need to be revised. Therefore, the Soybean and Rice Industry Association convened a meeting of directors and supervisors at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon at the Grain and Oil Cake Exchange at 15 Avenue Edward VII to continue discussing and revising the various articles. It was also resolved that the autumn entry permits for the market would expire on the 14th of this month and would be invalidated. Winter entry permits will be reissued from the 14th to the 16th of this month, from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM each day, still at the North Office. The three-month tea fee for this season will be paid at the same time, as well as four photos per person to be used for 1929.

Elect Representatives to Form Conciliation Council

The meeting originally intended to hold a joint meeting of the Rice Industry Seven Organizations and the Shantou, Tianjin, and Yangtze Gangs in addition to the meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss the election of conciliation members to mediate disputes arising from transactions within the industry. However, because the organization of the Shantou, Tianjin, and Yangtze Gangs was not sound, only a joint meeting of the seven organizations was held. It was resolved that each organization would elect one or two people to serve as conciliation members to form a conciliation committee to mediate disputes within the industry.

Merchants Should Pay Fees

Furthermore, the Rice Market Management Committee resolved at its 50th meeting to issue a notice stipulating the fees payable by each merchant as follows: (A) 10 yuan per shop per month for fellow merchants, with a maximum of eight people per shop and no increase allowed; (B) 4 yuan per shop per month for non-licensed fellow merchants, with a maximum of four people per shop, and an additional 1 yuan per person per month for additional personnel; (C) 4 yuan per shop per month for resellers, with a maximum of four people per shop, and an additional 1 yuan per person per month for additional personnel; (D) 1.5 yuan per person per month for brokers. The above fees will be collected from this winter.

### Four Members of Japanese Youth Party Beaten for Protesting Resignation of Japanese Consul; Strange Men Leave After Achieving Their Goal; Youth Party Decides to Send Representatives Back to Country to Report

All members of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, including Consul General Miura Yoshiaki, submitted their resignations on the 10th to express their unanimous opposition to the country's establishment of a Ministry of Trade and in response to the mass resignation of officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The consulate's duties declined sharply in the previous two days. However, members of the "Greater Japan Youth Party" in Shanghai were dissatisfied with Miura's actions and drafted a strong protest, roughly stating, "In the current extraordinary times and extraordinary circumstances, how can stationed personnel do such a thing?" They sent representatives Tsunematsu Noboru, Kumagai Kazuo, Miyahara Jiro, and Kirita Shikakichi with the document to the consulate on the afternoon of the 12th to deliver it to Consul General Miura in person. They left at 5:00 PM and were returning when four strange men suddenly emerged from the roadside near Wuchang Road, each holding a naval bayonet and a small iron awl, shouting, "Youth Party, how can you be so rude!" They immediately beat the four representatives. The four representatives also jumped up to resist. Kirimiya and Harada were severely injured and fell to the ground. The strange men left leisurely after achieving their goal. The other two took the injured to Jiangnan Hospital for treatment and reported to the Japanese Military Police and the Consulate Police Department requesting a thorough investigation. The Shanghai branch of the "Greater Japan Youth Party" convened an emergency meeting and resolved to send one representative to Tokyo immediately to report to the party headquarters.

### Negotiations Over West Shanghai Policing Authority – Discussed with the Chinese Government – British and American Attitude Firm, Preferring to Shelve the Issue – Hold the Same View on the Defense Zone Problem

The Shanghai Municipal Council spokesman issued a statement on the 4th, declaring that the Council has no intention of abandoning its rights and interests over the extra-settlement roads in West Shanghai. Although the facts indicate that the Japanese and puppet regime are indeed challenging these rights and interests, the Council is still in negotiations with the Japanese and puppet regime. On the 6th, Council Chairman Fessenden further elaborated on this solemn declaration, stating that the Council is dissatisfied with the current situation and should find a way to clarify it, and that the police force in the area has been increased threefold compared to before August 13th, which proves that the Council has no intention of abandoning the policing authority in the area. On the same day, puppet Mayor Fu Xiaoan told the English-language "China Press" that the puppet regime will absolutely not compromise unless the Council completely returns the policing authority in the area. The two sides exchanged sharp words. It is evident that apart from a meeting and negotiation in early September, Fei (Fessenden) has not continued negotiations to this day, and has in fact stalled. The truth is that the authorities have not divulged it.

Two Negotiations

Yesterday, according to a certain foreign official, negotiations on the extra-settlement roads are actually related to the issue of adjusting the defense zone. This matter has been closely discussed by the defense force leaders of various countries, and all relevant parties hold a firm attitude. After careful study by the British, American, and Italian defense forces on the specific plan proposed by the Japanese side to adjust the defense zone, the Japanese side's request for the British army to withdraw from West Shanghai, if implemented, would mean that the Council's policing authority over the extra-settlement roads would lose its guarantee, and the puppet police could do whatever they wanted. With the loss of policing authority, taxes would be equivalent to being abandoned. Since the British defense forces could not agree to this, the American side has also firmly expressed its opposition. The British and American sides now believe that the extra-settlement road issue and the adjustment of the defense zone issue can only be thoroughly resolved by negotiating with the Chinese government, which has territorial sovereignty. Engaging in empty courtesies with the puppet regime is not a wise move. The Chinese government is currently far away in Chongqing, and the puppet government has not been recognized internationally, so it seems difficult to achieve a thorough and complete solution for the time being. Therefore, both issues have to be temporarily shelved. The unspoken implication seems to be that if a reasonable solution to the concession issue cannot be obtained for the time being, then it can only be waited for in the future.

Puppet Regime Attempts to Collect Vehicle Tax

According to reliable sources yesterday morning, the puppet municipal government plans to collect license fees for automobiles and other vehicles operating on the extra-settlement roads from November 1st, but it has not yet been fully decided and is still under consideration by the puppet municipal government. In addition, the English-language "China Press" reported that it was learned from reliable sources this morning (the 13th) that automobiles and other vehicles driving on roads outside the settlement and adjacent roads under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government may be required to display licenses issued by the Special Municipal Government from November 1st. The Special Municipal Government has been considering this method for some time, so it is not a sudden decision.

Establishing a Puppet Court and Issuing Notices

In the extra-settlement road area, the Japanese and puppet regime's actions are intensifying. The puppet police seized policing authority first, followed by the organization of miscellaneous troops. Recently, they have taken a further step in attempting to seize judicial power. After the so-called "West Shanghai Branch of the Shanghai Local Court" announced its establishment on October 1st, it suddenly posted notices yesterday in various major traffic hubs, stating that the court had begun selling stamp paper and accepting lawsuits on October 11th. The notice was signed by "Branch President" Lu Qi and "Chief Prosecutor" Qiu Zhun. The court is located at the original site of Datong University. From now on, the lives and property of West Shanghai residents will probably lose legal protection.

Extravagant and High-Profile, Causing Unease

The puppet organization of the puppet "Shanghai Special Municipal Government," since its establishment on October 16th of last year, will soon reach its one-year anniversary. Yesterday, the puppet organization, in addition to erecting a colored archway on the Garden Bridge, also rushed to make a pine and cypress archway at the intersection of Great Western Road and Caobojiao in West Shanghai, spanning the road and connecting the Fang Tiande Pharmacy and the Da Hongyun Restaurant. Both sides of the archway had huge five-color flags crossed in the center, with the fifteen large circular characters "Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government." They were all made of wood, and surrounded by small five-color electric lights. Passing pedestrians all cast sidelong glances.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Slaughterhouse Rented to the Japanese Side

Confirmed for a Period of One Year – Rental Fee Kept Secret

The English-language "China Press" reported that, according to official sources this morning (the 13th), the Municipal Council has made a proposal regarding the Japanese merchants' lease of the Council's slaughterhouse for a period of one year. This statement has been confirmed by Council Chairman Fessenden. Fessenden did not disclose the name of the lessee, only stating that the group is organized by Japanese people. The details of the lease of the slaughterhouse are currently being discussed by the Council and the "Japanese Group." The amount of rent must be kept secret for the time being. As for the management of the slaughterhouse, Fessenden stated that the Council will continue to exercise its power, and the meat will still be inspected by the Council's Health Department as usual. The Japanese Group recently applied to purchase or lease the slaughterhouse, and the Council made a proposal, but the Japanese Group has not yet responded to the Council's proposal.

### "Hwa Hsing Notes" Have Become Waste Paper

Puppet Regime's Tax Revenue Disappearing – Now Changing Back to Using Legal Tender

"Hwa Hsing Notes" are not only universally rejected by people in the concessions, but have also disappeared in the Japanese and puppet strongholds in the suburbs, and no one uses them. Therefore, the "Tax Collection Offices" in various districts are now levying puppet "taxes" using legal tender as the standard. When they previously forced people to pay "taxes" with "Hwa Hsing Notes," "tax" revenue disappeared. They had no choice but to retreat and accommodate the public in order to maintain their lifeline. If anyone carrying "Hwa Hsing Notes" walked into the guerrilla zone, they would be punished by the Chinese army.

### Encouraging Exports, Maintaining Production, Fundamentally Stabilizing Finance – Providing Various Facilities for Export Cargo Insurance – If Costs Are Too High, the Central Government Will Purchase as Much as Possible – Export Surplus Increases Monthly, Customs Officers Insufficiently Distributed

The Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that stabilizing finance requires stabilizing foreign exchange, stabilizing foreign exchange requires maintaining the credit of legal tender, and maintaining the credit of legal tender requires replenishing foreign exchange reserves, and that the method of replenishing foreign exchange reserves, in addition to transporting cash and purchasing foreign currency, requires encouraging export trade, has now ordered the Trade Commission to encourage exports, adjust market prices, and maintain production. The details are as follows:

Measures to Encourage Exported Goods

Measures to encourage the export of domestic goods: (1) Exported goods are allowed to be insured against war risk with the Central Trust Bureau. Those certified by the Trade Commission for foreign sales are specially allowed to keep the insurance premiums on account. If the goods are sold at a loss, the insurance premiums will be waived and paid by the government on its behalf. (2) The competent authorities shall provide full convenience for the transportation of exported goods, and no transit tax shall be levied upon transshipment. (3) Exporters of goods who settle foreign exchange with the government may, upon presentation of settlement documents, collect the difference between the legal price and the listed price of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications from the settling bank. (4) Tung oil, tea, bristles, and mineral products, due to barter debt repayment relationships, shall be purchased, transported, and sold by government trade agencies in a unified manner.

Adjusting Market Prices, Maintaining Production

The Trade Commission is ordered by the Ministry to adjust market prices and maintain production: (1) When the cost of export goods is lower than the price in the foreign market, the Trade Commission shall set the purchase price of the goods in the place of origin and its distribution market based on the price in the foreign market. All Chinese and foreign merchants shall purchase as much as possible according to this fixed price. (2) When the cost of export goods is higher than the price in the foreign market, the Trade Commission shall set the purchase price of the goods in its place of origin and distribution market based on the production cost of the goods. The Commission shall purchase as much as possible according to the fixed price, and all losses shall be borne by the national treasury.

Unified Control Effective, Exports Increase Sharply

Regarding the export of domestic goods, due to the effectiveness of government control, there has been no sharp decrease due to the war. Especially since the promulgation of the measure to collect the difference between the exchange settlement of domestic goods and the legal price in July of this year, the export value of domestic goods has reached a new record since the war. It was 79,884,949 yuan in July and 100,867,741 yuan in August. Animals and animal products accounted for the largest share of exported domestic goods, followed by mineral sands, metals, and metal products, and then textiles, fibers, waxes, and piece goods. This has improved China's trade and reduced the overall trade deficit.

Trade Improves in Various Southwest Customs Offices – The Customs authorities have learned that customs affairs in various southwest customs offices, such as Longzhou, Mengzi, Tengyue, Simao, Leizhou, and Beihai, are becoming increasingly developed, and the export of domestic goods has increased sharply, so that the original customs officers are insufficiently distributed for work, and they have successively telegraphed the Chief Secretary of Customs to dispatch customs officers to go there. The Chief Secretary of Customs has agreed to the requests of the various customs offices and has dispatched many customs officers to the various southwest customs offices, which is a situation rarely seen in the past. Moreover, the import and export trade of the above customs offices has all turned into a surplus after the war, which is indeed a good phenomenon for China's trade. The various southwest customs offices have now become the center of gravity for the export of domestic goods.

### North China Shipping Repeatedly Obstructed – Foreign Ships Deeply Stimulated – Instigating Barge Strikes, Delaying Quarantine – Backward Loading and Unloading, Merchants Suffer Significant Losses – Southeast Asian Schedules Inaccurate, Limited to Loading New Goods

The shipping business from Shanghai to Singapore and other places in Southeast Asia is extremely developed. Therefore, after the British Taikoo Company was hit by the South China route, it moved the former Shantou-Hong Kong direct to Singapore route to Shanghai. The Guiyang, Anhui, and other Southeast Asian routes also came to Shanghai.

Outbreak of European War – Secret Schedules

After the outbreak of the European war, the schedules are secret. Generally, there are two shifts per week for the Shanghai-Hong Kong route, and one ship each for the Shanghai-Siam and Shanghai-Singapore routes. Temporary changes are made in the event of special circumstances. The Anhui ship, originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai yesterday, via Xiamen, Hong Kong to Singapore, and concurrently to Wan Pineng, was changed to export today due to congestion of passengers and cargo, incomplete procedures, and receipt of a telegram from the Hong Kong agency limiting the loading of new goods, so more than 500 tons of new goods were withdrawn from customs. The Shanghai-Hong Kong line of Jardine Matheson & Co. also has two ships per week, but the schedules are often changed due to inaccurate schedules. Most of the passengers and cargo on the South China line are contracted by the Ewo-Taikoo Transportation Company. As for the North China line, British shipping has encountered various inconveniences, resulting in inaccurate schedules. Regular ships are like irregular ships.

Yantai-Tianjin Shipping Repeatedly Obstructed

According to those familiar with the current situation in Yantai and Tianjin, both are in the hands of certain people. The previous Yantai barge strike has been resolved, but now, after the Tianjin ship arrives at Tanggu, it is not inspected, and the quarantine is delayed for several days. Passengers are invisibly detained on the ship for three or four days. As for the loading and unloading of cargo, the cargo of a certain country's merchant ships is given priority, and only after they are loaded is the cargo of other countries' ships loaded and unloaded, which also causes a delay of several days. All kinds of difficulties are endless, resulting in significant losses and greatly affecting the schedules. Therefore, foreign ships to Tianjin are deeply stimulated.

### Preventing Outflow of Fractional Currency – Solemn Issuance

Limited to Twenty Yuan per Household – Bank of China Denies Discovery of Counterfeit Notes

After the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank issued one-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent fractional currency notes, the Bank had to adopt a gradual issuance system in order to prevent a large amount from flowing into the occupied areas. Now, for requests from legitimate firms, companies, and factories, the Bank secretly examines and approves them, stipulating that each firm is limited to exchanging 20 yuan of fractional currency notes. As of yesterday, 450,000 yuan has been issued and will soon be completed. As for the second batch of 500,000 yuan, it is being rushed to print by the American Wing On Company in Hong Kong and will be shipped to Shanghai for continued issuance by the Shanghai Branch after printing. The Bank has denied the rumor of the discovery of counterfeit notes, and stated that the printing cost of each first batch of fractional currency notes is more than one cent of national currency. Moreover, according to the current prices of banknote paper and printing costs, the printing cost is bound to double again.

### A Great Change in Ethics, Unprecedented in the World: The Story of a Filial Son's Patricide, the Defendant's Lawyer's Eloquent Argument, the Case Has Been Concluded and Sentencing is Scheduled

In the early years of the Republic, in Sanlintang, Pudong, Zhang Xinsheng poisoned his father, Zhang Jiayun. Also, ten years ago, in the Shanghai Public Concession, an unmarried woman, Zhang Wenqing, killed her stepmother. At that time, it caused a sensation in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, today, a huge case of patricide has occurred again on Haig Road in western Shanghai. Afterwards, they even attempted to destroy the body and dismember it. The cruelty of the means is unprecedented in modern times. It is truly what is called the decline of morals and a great change in ethics. The details of the incident have been seen in the newspapers on the 6th and 7th of this month. This morning, the Special First Court continued to hear the case. The details are recorded as follows:

Skilled in Socializing, a Small Accumulation

The deceased, Zhou Yong, was fifty years old and from Ningbo. He used to be the manager of a branch of the French Pharmacy in Fengtian. After the September 18th Incident, he resigned and came to Shanghai, where he was the head of the business department of the Jiu Fu Pharmaceutical Company on Baker Road in this city. He was skilled in socializing and extremely frugal, so he had a small accumulation in his hands. He built his own house at 228 and a half Haig Road, where he lived with his wife, Jing (48 years old, from Shanghai), his daughter Zhou Qinzhu (25 years old), his eldest son Qinji (24 years old), and his second son Qinxiang (21 years old). However, Zhou was extremely strict and stubborn in managing the family on weekdays, and there was no smile in the house, so the family feared him like a tiger. He treated his wife, Jing, even worse, often beating and scolding her if she did not do as he wished, giving her the impression that he wished she would die sooner. His two sons had been studying at Nanyang Model Middle and Primary School since September of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and recently they had been studying at the Pudong Building Cram School.

Unable to Bear Abuse, He Hastily Took Poisonous Measures

Because he saw his mother suffering unbearably, he tried to persuade him, but unexpectedly, he angered him and stopped providing tuition fees, which deepened his resentment. So, at just after 1 AM on the 5th of this month, he connected the wires to electricity, taking advantage of his father's deep sleep, he hastily took poisonous measures, electrocuting his father to death. Afterwards, he dismembered the body, sawing off the head and placing it in a water tank, and cutting off both legs at the knees, intending to destroy the body with saltpeter and sulfuric acid. Unexpectedly, it was seen by his daughter, Zhou Qinzhu, who reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Inspector Zhu Jihuang and Detectives Liang Junshan and Mian Wuqilan were dispatched to the scene, where they arrested the criminals Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang, as well as their mother, Zhou Jing, along with saws, drills, electric wires, saltpeter, sulfuric acid, etc., and sent them to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Meanwhile, the prosecutor's office verified that the body had died from electrocution during his lifetime. The details have been recorded in this newspaper.

A Huge Case of Patricide, Rare in the World

Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin took the seat in the Second Criminal Court to continue the trial. Ordinary men and women, because the case was a case of patricide, unprecedented in modern times, all wanted to see the protagonists in the case. Therefore, those who came to court to listen were packed. The defendant, Zhou Qinji, was short in stature and wore a gray cloth robe. Zhou Qinxiang was taller than his elder brother and wore a blue cloth robe. His mother, Zhou Jing, wore a women's prisoner uniform with the number 390. All had pale complexions and stood in the defendant's box with their heads bowed. Lawyers Ye Shaoying and Yang Sicheng were also hired to defend them in court. First, Police Station Lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the details of the case, saying that the defendant, Zhou Jing, was arrested in the kitchen of the stove downstairs. Observing her situation, she seemed to be the one on watch. The first two defendants, Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang, were arrested upstairs. All the evidence used to plot the murder and dismember the body has been brought to the case and photographed by the police station and presented to the court.

The Murderous Paraphernalia Were Investigated Clearly

He said that the electric wires used by the defendants had a total of two, one placed on the head of the deceased and one placed on the feet, so there was still hair of the deceased on one of the electric wires. After Zhou Yongjie died, the defendants immediately stole a passbook of the Bank of China hidden in the room, totaling 1,131 yuan, 7 jiao, and 4 fen, and a seal, and 45 yuan in cash, and placed them beside them. Then they used 5 yuan to purchase offerings. Therefore, when the defendants were arrested, only 40 yuan in cash, a passbook, and a seal were found. The electric wire was bought from the Daguang Electric Company at 106 Tongfu Road. The drills and saws were purchased from Yongtaixing Hardware Store at 134 Tongfu Road and Ruikang Hardware Store on Anfu Road respectively. The saltpeter was purchased from the China Bookstore. These shops have been investigated by the police station and found to be correct.

Confessed to Destroying the Body and Eliminating Traces

The defendants Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang confessed in the police station that because their father usually treated them harshly and abused them frequently, and wanted to put their mother to death, they hated him and plotted to kill their father. Afterwards, they discussed with their mother how to destroy the body and eliminate traces without denial. The confession was recorded and presented to the court for investigation. When Judge Fu questioned the defendants Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang, they all confessed that they electrocuted their father. Fu asked them, "Since you killed your father, why did you dismember the body and destroy the traces? How did you know this method?" They answered, "I saw it in a natural science book when I was young. Because if I didn't kill my father, my mother would definitely die." When asked Zhou Jing, she said, "I really didn't know when they killed him. Because my husband was usually harsh and created trouble, even for the smallest things, he would scold me endlessly. He was even stricter with the two sons, which caused this disaster. Although I knew about it afterwards, I didn't help."

Stated the Course of Events, Started the Debate

Then, West Inspector Wei Lugoff testified that the police station received a report from Zhou Qinzhu and went to Haig Road at 6 PM on October 6 to investigate and saw her and the maid in the kitchen. They arrested them. The Zhou brothers were arrested upstairs. At that time, the balcony door was locked, so she took out the key and opened the door, and the body was found. Photos have been taken, etc. Then Lawyer Wang Yaotang stated again that the deceased's daughter, Zhou Qinzhu, was in shock and had a nervous breakdown. She is currently at her relative Li Pengfei's place and did not come today. If the court believes that she must come to court, then she can come to court next time. Judge Fu, believing that the case was clear, ordered the debate to begin. At that time, the defendant's lawyer, Ye Shaoying, suddenly stood up and claimed that before the debate began, he requested an appraisal of the defendants, because the defendants were all young students, how could they commit such a huge case of patricide?

The Evidence of Guilt is Clear, Prosecution According to Law

Zhou Jing suffered from heart disease, and her sister had mental illness. Now Zhou Qinzhu is also having a nervous breakdown, so the defendants are indeed in a state of mental disorder and should be appraised by experts, etc. Judge Fu ruled in court that no appraisal was necessary. The police station's lawyer Wang immediately stood up and argued that this case was a huge case of patricide, and dismembering the body after death was really unethical. Moreover, the defendants also confessed in court that they electrocuted their father and dismembered the body without denial. The evidence of guilt is clear. Now the police station is prosecuting according to Article 272 of the Criminal Law, which is the murder of a direct ascendant relative. The penalty is (1) death penalty, (2) life imprisonment. It should be sentenced according to law. Although Zhou Jing's part is prosecuted according to the same article, but according to the trial situation, she denied having conspired to kill. Then, although she did not conspire to kill beforehand, she could not deny that she knew about the destruction of the body afterwards. There was indeed help. Please sentence according to Article 247 of the Criminal Law and Article 30 of the same law for helping to destroy the body, etc.

Beating and Scolding, Forcing to Drop Out of School

The defendant's lawyers Yang Linzhi, Ye Shaoying, and Yang Sicheng argued that the defendants were guilty of a huge crime of patricide, and according to law, they should be subject to the sanctions of national law, and there was no need to argue further. But in fact, the defendants were really in an unavoidable situation that their nature could not tolerate. The victim did not care about the education of his two sons (i.e., the defendants), only ordering them to do cleaning and labor. Later, although they were encouraged by relatives and friends, they were able to enter school, but it was not long before they were forced to drop out of school. The defendants' desire to dedicate themselves to the country was also rejected. Every day, they only suffered the victim's beating and scolding. This was no different from living in hell. Later, the defendants falsely claimed to go out to do business, but in fact they secretly entered the China Vocational School to study and prepare for exams, and to avoid poison. All tuition fees were secretly subsidized by their mother. Therefore, according to the victim's usual treatment, and without the mother's nurturing, the defendants would have died long ago.

Mother Suffered from a Serious Illness, Abuse Became More Severe

Furthermore, the defendant's mother was originally kind and gentle, but since marrying the victim, she has suffered all kinds of hardships, resulting in severe heart disease. According to the doctor's diagnosis, her heart was enlarged, and there was a risk of death at any time. But the victim did not care and used violent means to confront her. As usual, beating was common. Recently, he beat her severely for a small reason and even drove her out. The defendants witnessed this and were heartbroken. Although they tried to dissuade him, it was ineffective. The defendant's mother had no choice but to temporarily avoid him at her aunt's house. If the victim had any thought of the love of a married couple, he would have welcomed her home. But the facts proved the opposite. Later, after repeated persuasion from relatives and friends, he reluctantly welcomed her home. After the mother returned home, the victim's old habits returned and became even worse. The mother was sick and could not eat rice, so she only cooked porridge for herself. But the victim always took the rice for cooking porridge and threw it on the ground. The mother was afraid of the wind, but he would open the windows wide. The mother wanted to sleep, but he would scold her all night.

Since You Are Not a Father, the Son is Not a Son

His intention was to stimulate those suffering from enlarged heart disease. Regardless of whether he had the intention of killing his mother, according to the facts, his intentions were also terrible. The defendants therefore believed that if this continued, the victim's intentions could not be reversed, and the mother's life would not be guaranteed. Considering the victim's various behaviors, he regarded his mother as a thorn in his side and his sons as enemies. There was no love between husband and wife, and there was even less love of father and son. Then the victim had long since cut himself off from ethics. The defendants were young and not knowledgeable enough. They could not persuade their father to change his mind, and they could not bear to sit by and watch their mother die. Therefore, rather than recognize a father who kills the mother and tolerate the father, they would rather kill the father who kills the mother and save the mother. If the father is alive, the mother dies. If the father dies, the mother survives. Since the father is not a father, the son is not a son. Therefore, this case occurred.

Debate Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled

The above is all true, without any embellishment. Relatives and friends can testify. Thinking that our country is teaching filial piety, the defendants are guilty of death, but they still cannot stop speaking. Their old and sick mother is saddened by the tragic death of her husband and grieved by the extreme punishment of her two sons. Her heart is in pain and she will not live long. Not only will the ancestors' sacrifices be cut off from now on, but the Zhou family will also be destroyed from now on. We dare to ask your court to consider the circumstances and show mercy, to impose a lighter sentence on the two defendants Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang, and to declare Zhou Jing innocent, etc. Then, even on the day of their death, the defendants will still feel alive. Judge Fu reported and declared the debate concluded, and scheduled the sentencing to be announced at 10 AM on the 20th of this month. The defendants were still sent back to detention separately.

### Pudong Bank Established a New Office on Shanzhong Road

Pudong Commercial Savings Bank has a long history and provides thoughtful service, and has always been trusted by all sectors of society. Therefore, business has progressed year by year. This spring, dozens of Pudong Bank New Village garden residences were built on Shanzhong Road, Maiyang Road in the French Concession. The gardens and fish ponds are newly and elegantly arranged, making them new and artistic buildings. Now, in order to facilitate customers in the western district, the bank has built its own Shanzhong Road office at the west end of the new village, which has been completed and is scheduled to open on the 14th of this month. It is reported that in order to benefit customers, all types of deposits will be increased by one percent, and there will be commemorative gifts.

### Statistics on the Number of Refugees

According to the report of the Public Works Department on the 12th of this month, there are currently 29 refugee shelters inspected by the department, accommodating a total of 38,445 refugees.

### Tongyi Shipping Company Relocated

Tongyi Shipping Company was founded by He Xiyu and Xu Lisheng, pioneers in the shipping industry, specializing in acting as agents for commercial vessels of various countries sailing to various coastal ports. The business has been developing day by day. It is now known that the company has also established Tongyi Coal Company, which transports and sells domestic and foreign smokeless coal in Shanghai to supplement the shortage of fuel in the market. It is heard that the original office is not enough, and it has now been determined that the building will be located at 77 Puyi Building, Sichuan Road, and will officially open on the 16th.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory predicted at 4:30 PM yesterday that the weather around Shandong was clear and the wind was undirected. The weather here and in the East China Sea was cloudy with local drizzle and northeast to southeast winds. The low pressure north of Taiwan is moving northeast and east. The center of the hurricane was within 120 miles of 16 degrees north latitude and 132 degrees east longitude at 2 PM. The wind direction was northwest and the wind force was unknown. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 79.2 and the lowest was 68.9. At the same time last year, the highest was 82.8 and the lowest was 63.7.

### Employees of a Chinese and Western Pharmacy in Western Shanghai Were Detained for Hanging Flags on National Day and Have Not Yet Been Released

According to the China News Agency, on the day of National Day celebrations the other day, the whole city in the Shanghai concession area uniformly hung flags to celebrate. In western Shanghai, due to the special circumstances, although residents intended to hang flags to celebrate, they could not do so due to the environment. It is remembered that the branch of the Chinese and Western Pharmacy on Dinhai Road, due to a momentary surge of patriotism, hung the blue sky, white sun, and red earth flag high on the roof, fluttering in the sky, which was very exciting. Unexpectedly, the "Avenue Police" patrolling the area saw this flag and expressed their dissatisfaction. Without asking for details, they entered the store and roared loudly. Mr. Shen, a senior employee of the store, argued with the pseudo police according to reason, but to no avail. Before long, a large number of pseudo police were called to arrest Shen and several employees in the store to the pseudo "police station." The national flag was also torn down. It is said that the several people who were arrested have not yet been released.

### A Case of Students Colluding with Detectives to Beat Classmates Was Prosecuted for Injury and Obstruction of Freedom. The Victim Has Been Out of Danger After Surgery

Zou Zhengzhi, a local student at the private Shanghai Middle School on Chengdu Road, had a quarrel with his classmate Fang Yimou over a trivial matter in the school dormitory on the morning of the 24th of last month. Zou left the school privately and invited two detectives from the French Police Department, Wang Biqing (No. 301) and Li Boqing (No. 215), to the school and beat Fang severely. Wang and Li also threatened Fang with guns, saying, "Do you know what Mr. Zou's status is? You are really brave to dare to argue with him." Zou realized that he had caused trouble and quickly hired a car to send Fang to Baolong Hospital for treatment to comfort Fang Yimou. The hospital notified the police station by telegram, and the police arrested Zou, Wang, and Li one after another and sent them to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. This morning, the trial continued. The police stated that the victim had been out of danger after surgery, so they prosecuted each defendant for injury and obstruction of freedom. Judge Fu, because the defendants only admitted to hitting the victim and denied threatening to obstruct the victim with a service pistol, ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and adjourned the trial to summon witnesses to testify again.

### A Fact—Elementary School Students Reading Classical Chinese—

—Zefu

Last year, my son was studying at a senior elementary school in my hometown. He wrote me a letter during the summer vacation, saying that he wanted to buy a book called "One Hundred Essays on Classical Chinese Writing Style." When I received this letter, I was a little dazed. I thought he had written the title of the book incorrectly, or that he wanted me to buy some children's books for him to read during the summer vacation. I immediately wrote back to ask what he needed that book for and whether he had written the title of the book incorrectly. Later, I received a reply saying that he still wanted to buy it because he knew that he would be reading that book in the next semester. The school stipulated that students entering the first grade of senior elementary school would have to read some classical Chinese, and the teacher had selected that book. Driven by curiosity, he wanted to read it himself during the summer vacation. By the time school started, he could also save on the cost of that book at school. When I read this letter, I was still dazed. I didn't know why the teacher had selected that book. Didn't the Ministry of Education stipulate that elementary schools were not allowed to teach classical Chinese? Later, although I bought the book, I didn't ask him how his reading went, whether he had understood the so-called "writing style," or whether he had understood some of the content of "classical Chinese."

This year, I have a brother-in-law in Shanghai who has also entered the first grade of senior elementary school. Because I live next door to him, one night he brought a book called "Beixin Literary Selections" to ask me about some unfamiliar characters and difficult sentences. The texts in this book were selected from the "Beixin Loose-Leaf Literary Selections," and they were all in classical Chinese, with no less than twenty or thirty articles. I immediately asked him what this was, and he said it was Chinese. Now that I have entered senior elementary school, in addition to the national language, I also have to read classical Chinese. The teacher also taught them how to read, which should be like an old scholar, with cadence and tone, not like reading the national language in a flat tone. I was a little dazed again when I heard this. I didn't expect that what happened last year would happen again this year. The things that happened in my hometown and Shanghai are exactly the same. From this, it can also be seen that it has become a common phenomenon for elementary schools to teach students to read classical Chinese, and it is not just an isolated case in one school. I immediately flipped through that "Literary Selections." The first article was Zhou Dunyi's "Ode to the Lotus," and there were also texts from Zuo Zhuan, Guoce, the Analects, and Mencius. What's even stranger is that there were also several parallel prose pieces, which seemed to be written by Bao Zhao (the book is not by my side, and the titles of the articles are already blurred). I really have to admire the teaching skills of that teacher.

This is a fact. Do elementary school students really need to read classical Chinese? This doesn't seem to be a question worth discussing again now. But the fact is that, whether in the city or in the countryside, it seems that most teachers think that it is necessary to read some classical Chinese. Perhaps this is caused by the parents. Because I know that most elementary school teachers are definitely unwilling to do this thankless job. As for why parents hope their children to read some classical Chinese, part of it is of course due to the influence of traditional thinking. They think that since I read classical Chinese when I was young, I must teach them to read some too. Don't you see advertisements in Shanghai newspapers often asking for tutors to teach classical Chinese? Part of it is due to the needs of the environment. Like the school my son attends, it is run jointly by several businessmen. They hope that students will enter the business world after graduation. Most of the writing used in the business world is still in classical Chinese. For example, correspondence absolutely cannot be in vernacular. I have heard them say that if they graduate from elementary school now and only read a few national language books, not to mention that they can't write letters in the classical style, they can't even understand the newspapers. Is this true? It is indeed true, because elementary school students today have not read classical Chinese at all, so of course they cannot read and write in the classical style. Therefore, I also have a feeling that Chinese education is not very widespread. It is already a great blessing for a student to graduate from elementary school. According to my hometown's estimates, among students, about eight out of ten can finish junior elementary school; about three out of ten can finish senior elementary school; and only about one out of ten can finish middle school. Most of those who graduate from senior elementary school go into business. In the current business environment, it is really necessary to supplement some classical Chinese, because this is to understand the students' future, and it does not seem to be wrong to make slight changes to the curriculum!

But then again. What I call classical Chinese is only a kind of simple classical Chinese, suitable for practical use. For example, letting them read some classical Chinese letters in class, or guiding them on how to read news. This kind of classical Chinese is no different from vernacular Chinese. It seems harmless to teach them to read it. But I still think that the "One Hundred Essays on Classical Chinese Writing Style" is not suitable. This only teaches students to spend more brainpower and still does not help with practical use. My son is in my hometown, and I don't know what his classical Chinese level is like now. My brother-in-law, except for being able to recite, really doesn't get any practical benefits. Because his teacher only teaches rigidly, he can only memorize rigidly (not to say read). This is indeed the most urgent problem now, especially in Shanghai. I really want to advise teachers in general that it's okay not to teach classical Chinese, but if you really have to teach it, it's better to cut out some news and advertisement texts from the newspaper and let them read them. It would be more helpful!

### A Stranger

—Tang Wei

——Memories Collected from the Ashes of War

During the day, this land of immortals is only left with me accompanying the wormwood with its long tassels and all kinds of insects that should be in the autumn season. They seem not to know that there is still someone here, they just ignore it and shout bravely. It is difficult for you to understand whether their tune is sad or loving.

Occasionally, a fisherman from the river flies over the fence. He only rests for a while and then goes to work for his belly again.

The clouds lazily skimmed over the open field, rushing along without any consciousness.

Orders, authority, have completely lost their effect on these things. Only they are still the same as in the past, making people remember and feel.

In order to receive a strange guest, I sat idly under the eaves for another three hours. He came, already after eleven o'clock.

A short man with a deep scar across his left face. He had a familiar appearance and dress. In fact, I had never seen him before, let alone seen that green gown and those local cloth shoes with short faces.

"Is there a Mr. Tang?"

"That's me!"

He handed me a letter of introduction, and we shook hands warmly. I let him come into the room and sit down.

We passed a moment in silence.

"Is your injury better?" he asked with concern.

Although it was a secret not to tell others, at this moment I felt like I was facing a comrade, a partner, and a confidant.

"Much better!"

Facing us, the bronze bells of the Lama Temple (Note 1) began to chime desperately. The big ones and the small ones, the unbalanced sound waves, awakened a kind of irresistible tremor in the eardrums.

A small restaurant delivered lunch.

"Just eat something here!" Without waiting for the guest to answer, I continued to tell the waiter at the restaurant, "Send another bowl of braised cake and bring a few more steamed buns."

The sun was hotter than before, and the wormwood lowered its head listlessly.

He had a good appetite. Half a steamed bun only turned around in his mouth before he swallowed it. In order to save time, he seemed to leave all the digestive work to his stomach.

He described in detail the national salvation activities in Harbin, and also told many interesting stories. (His own life experience over the past year.)

After the meal, he didn't want me to be responsible for the meal expenses. After a dispute, he finally showed compromise.

We agreed on the opportunity to meet. Before leaving, he handed me two recent issues of "The People's Daily" and asked me to write some news about "Eastern Manchuria."

"Thank you for treating me to lunch!"

"No, saying that sounds too vulgar!"

Sending him back, the emptiness surrounded me again. But I forgot them, reading the newspaper, continuing to read the newspaper.

Note 1: "Lama Temple" is a kind of Lamaist church, whose believers are mostly White Russians.

### Today's Japan in the Age of Substitutes (Part 2)

— By Midorikawa Hideko, Translated by Wang Canjie

Puppet Assemblymen

Within the House of Representatives, during wartime, how serenely they convene their meetings! The whole atmosphere seems to contain a kind of anesthetic. Total national mobilization has not only silenced the people, but also turned those fiery-tongued assemblymen into mutes. They neither question nor protest. Some even let their foreheads touch the desk—dozing off. The guards had no choice but to wander among them with mint and brushes to "nudge" them awake.

——Agreed! Agreed!

From time to time, they would comically shout this out, half-awake from hazy dreams. In the meantime, an unprecedentedly huge military budget of six billion yen passed without any difficulty.

To my left, there was a middle-aged man who seemed to be from the countryside, muttering resentfully:

——Really, pigs! I only voted for him on the condition that he agree to my proposal to increase the subsidies for our village. But the shameless one! Now he doesn't even mention it. Alas? I really regret not voting for that Yamano fellow! It is said that the three people who elected him each got three yen!

To my right, two very modern girls, yawning, were also talking:

——The assemblymen have nothing to say except "Agreed," don't you think?

——Indeed, I think it would be more interesting to bring a few parrots and larks to the meeting! Because those parrots and larks would say "Agreed" more accurately and pleasantly than the rough-throated voices of those assemblymen from various regions!

The Speaker stood up:

——All the motions have been passed unanimously by the whole house. This is something to be very proud of. Now I would like to propose the last motion, please listen carefully:

Because of the war, a labor shortage is felt everywhere, but here it is not necessary to have many people. In my humble opinion, you assemblymen should also go to the front lines, factories, and rural areas. Only in this way will you be loyal subjects of His Majesty the Emperor! However, the constitution stipulates that a parliament of less than half the assemblymen cannot be convened. Therefore, let us make the following resolution: From the next time onwards, let's get some puppets made to look just like you to hold meetings in your place——

Then the Speaker vigorously tapped the table and said loudly:

——Does everyone agree or disagree?

The assemblymen, awakened from their naps, blurted out in unison, bewildered: "Agreed!" "Agreed!" While those sitting further back were still indulging in beautiful fantasies!

Then the bell rang, and the meeting was adjourned.

A noisy commotion arose around.

Ah! Was I also dozing off with those assemblymen? But, I am still in my own room in China! I rubbed my eyes and looked: on the table, there were still the Japanese newspapers spread out, just as they were before I went to sleep. Outside, the lights of cars were flashing, and people were running urgently—it was the sound of an air raid alarm that woke me up! And not the adjournment bell in the Japanese House of Representatives. (Translated from the "Esperanto China Way Report Bi-monthly")

### Fallen Leaves Street

— Xian Feng

White clouds drift, autumn sun fades, along the street, silence;

Fine gray sand sticks tight, ginkgo shells sleep sweetly;

A cool breeze gently plucks thin paulownia leaves,

See the wild goose shadows sweep across the sky!

The flames of war rage in my hometown,

Will bring a bright day. Nurture the next generation of warriors growing up in the bloodshed, by Sha Qingquan

### Years of Being Host and Guest... Separation Once It Happens. Li Wanchun and Mao Qinglai Split Up

— Wei Wo

Among the martial actors of Yang Xiaolou and Shang Heyu's generation, Li Wanchun debuted the earliest, a rising star revealing his talent. Regarding martial actors of the later generation, Wanchun is of course a leader. However, Wanchun's real art is limited; Wanchun's martial art dramas can enjoy such fame, half of which is really due to having good supporting actors.

When Wanchun was in the Binqing Society, Lan Yuechun was his old partner. Wanchun's ability to be popular as a child was due to Yuechun's close coordination. Wanchun's first trip to Shanghai was in 1929, when he came with Mei Lanfang. Yuechun and Wanchun broke up due to a disagreement in Shanghai that time. Yuechun began wandering in the south of the Yangtze River from that year on and never returned to the north.

After Lan Yuechun and Li Wanchun separated, Wanchun's supporting actor was replaced by Mao Qinglai. Qinglai was also a student of the Binqing Society. His foundation in martial arts was even better than Lan Yuechun's, so Wanchun, having lost Yuechun but gained Qinglai, felt even more comfortable.

Mao Qinglai and Li Wanchun have been partners for nearly ten years. In recent years, Wanchun has been able to have such a status, and to be fair, Qinglai's contribution cannot be ignored. However, Wanchun has developed a bad impression of Qinglai due to some relationship, which has damaged the affection between the two parties who have been together for many years.

Last year, Mao Qinglai left Li Wanchun without saying goodbye due to a salary issue and cooperated with Wu Yanheng after leaving Li. Because Wanchun was willing to accept Qinglai's request to double the salary, Qinglai returned to cooperate with Wanchun. After Li and Mao returned to their old friendship, everyone thought that Qinglai could cooperate with Wanchun to the end. Unexpectedly, news came that Qinglai had once again left Wanchun a few days ago!

The only reason Qinglai left Yongchun Society this time was disagreement with Wanchun. Qinglai, seeing that the relationship between the two parties was broken and it was difficult to work together, resolutely resigned from Wanchun and changed to cooperate with his younger brother Shilai. (The martial actor in Shilai's troupe was originally Gao Shenglin, but Shenglin has now left Mao to go elsewhere.) On the Yongchun side, after Qinglai left, his apprentice Jiang Tielin has succeeded Mao as Wanchun's supporting actor.

Wanchun and Qinglai have always been praised as the peony and green leaves. After many years of being host and guest, they have now split up. When people in Shanghai heard the news, they all regretted it for Wanchun!

### Mei Lanfang's Private Life (2)

— Li Feishu

—Miscellaneous Memories of Mei—

Mei's Personality

Anyone who has had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Mei, I believe, will have a good impression of his humble, gentle, and courteous attitude. This kind of expression is indeed an inner manifestation, not a contrived one. He treats a supporter and an opponent the same way. After meeting him, those who oppose him often change their tune imperceptibly, as sincerity can move people. In his usual home life, even if there are minor unpleasantries, he never speaks harshly or sternly. I have followed him for nearly 20 years and have only seen him lose his temper three times. Once, a close friend, Mr. Qi, was hosting an important person and asked him to join him temporarily. He was unwilling to go, and they argued on the phone. After explaining his reasons for not wanting to go, Mr. Qi still kept talking, so he got angry! Seeing him muster up his courage, he said, "Even a dog, if you drive it into a corner, it will jump over the wall!" This sentence was considered "harsh" for him. Another time, he was performing in the Lishi Society in Nanjing, singing Mulan Joins the Army, and the people below forgot to bring the red-tasseled spear. There was no way to borrow one, and the play was about to start, so he got angry! "What are you people doing? What do you eat for?" For him, this was considered "scolding." Another time, last year, he performed at the Great Shanghai Theater. A few days before leaving, the ticket price was increased by one yuan. He strongly disapproved of this move, and he had not given his permission in advance, so he blamed me for not stopping it. Finally, he snorted through his nose! "We only want money! We don't need to care about reputation." After saying this sentence, he completely cut off "verbal communication" with me for 24 hours. He didn't talk to me until the third day. For him, this was considered giving me a "stern look"!

### New Creation of Martial Arts Stars - Dahua Film Company

— Gu Fen

Dahua Film Company, which was recently established, says that the first sound film it produced "Red Lotus Temple" is six tenths finished.

Of course, the name Dahua Company is very strange. However, many of the staff are said to be veterans of the film industry. After the Shanghai war, many filmmakers organized drama troupes and roamed to various destinations. Among them, there was a troupe that was used to making martial arts films, such as Wu Wenchao, Ren Pengnian, Wu Lizhu, etc. They first went to Thailand. Originally, this group of people was much more famous than any other filmmakers in those territories, so they were very popular in Thailand. Every day, the box office was unexpectedly crowded. Seeing this situation, Wu Wenchao believed that there was a great business opportunity, so he ignited his ambition to make martial arts films. In this way, he tried his best to befriend many overseas Chinese merchants, who were also very interested in this, and gradually they went from talking about dramas to talking about making movies. At first, they planned to make the film locally, but later they felt the lack of machinery and talent, so they thought of Shanghai, and Wu Wenchao hurriedly left Thailand for this reason.

Although Shanghai has become an isolated island, the supply of materials is still relatively convenient, especially the problem of people is also easy to solve, so Dahua Company was quickly established.

New Movie Introduction

### Blood Washed the Black Prison

— Qi Hua

"Each Dawn I Die"

The G-Man craze has passed, but James Cagney's works are still popular. James's superior acting skills are definitely one reason, and another reason is that the writing of the script deviates from the early G-man format. For example, this "Blood Washed the Black Prison" powerfully criticizes corrupt officials. James is falsely imprisoned for twenty years for exposing their misdeeds. However, after the prosecutor who framed James is promoted to governor, he fears that the gangster Polly Kate will reveal his secret, and he also imprisons him. The playwright also created a brave and righteous gangster, George Raft, who, out of a sense of justice, finally clears James's unjust prison, and dies in a hail of bullets himself.

Although the director William Keighley focused more on portraying the friendship between James and George Raft than on exposing the misdeeds of corrupt officials, the process of James's unjust imprisonment in the dark prison also aroused the audience's hatred for the governor. (To be continued)

— Liu Zhenghu

Ms. Zhao Jinrong, from Beijing, is a top student of the opera school. She is nineteen years old, and her father has passed away. She has two younger brothers.

### Eating Tofu

— Xiao Tian

There are dance hostesses who feign coyness, use sweet words, and flatter their guests. The popular term in dance halls for this is called "pouring rice soup," or "eating tofu." The two are similar but different in reality. The so-called "pouring rice soup" means that I have cooked a bowl of rice soup and poured it on someone, and the person who receives and drinks it is like being enlightened and loses their mind, and obeys everything. However, if the plan does not work, it will take a lot of effort to cook the rice soup and feed the rice soup. Although it is said that the capital is small and the profit is large, it is ultimately very laborious, and only those with considerable experience can do it.

In the custom of the South, when someone dies, their relatives and friends are notified to offer condolences. At mealtime, they are fed tofu, so the saying "eating tofu at the funeral home" is like the northerners saying "drinking winter melon soup" for attending a wedding. The popular term "eating tofu" in dance halls is to regard the other party as a dead person, and compare oneself to a guest attending a funeral and eating tofu. In other words, it is to have fun with a dead person.

Therefore, those who pour rice soup on guests have a heart to please and flatter, and although they have ulterior motives, their situation is pitiful. Those who eat tofu on guests are like the beggars on Fourth Horse Road, begging for money from people and calling them "driving pigs." One spends money to buy a pig's head title, and the other breaks the bill and is regarded as a dead person. Although there are fools who are willing to do it, once it is revealed, they will definitely not be willing to do it, so it is punishable.

However, looking back on the dance hostesses who have been in the business for a long time, they mostly pour rice soup on their guests, and rarely eat the guests' tofu. Those who eat the guests' tofu are mostly young girls. When asked what "eating tofu" means, they are also at a loss for words. When young girls eat the guests' tofu, guests with more experience also eat their tofu. Therefore, they deceive each other with insincere sweet words. Pushing it to the extreme, the guests spend money and ruin their reputation, and the hostesses are humiliated and abandoned. Some are even at their wits' end and suddenly have suicidal thoughts. Those who used to regard others as dead people are now inevitably dead themselves. Therefore, deceiving oneself and deceiving others should be deeply warned against. In the past, Liu Xuande instructed A Dou: Do not refrain from doing good because it is small, do not do evil because it is small. Although eating tofu is a small evil, if it continues to happen, it will cause harm to the body and mind. I hope people in the dance world will deeply warn against it.

Unofficial History of Paradise

### The Filial Piety and Righteousness of the Three Lius

Before Xi Kui committed herself to Chengchi, there was a strong and interesting incident of being kissed by a passerby. The newspapers at that time were in uproar, and the whole country knew about it, so it is not necessary to repeat it here. However, after the police fined a certain eager man 50 yuan, for a time, everyone in the capital said that Xi Kui's kiss had a price. With such a beauty, as long as you prepare 50 Yuan heads, you can kiss her fragrant lips (Beijing people call it Yao Guaiguai). Why would the rich not be happy to do it? Xi Kui was very afraid when she heard this, and usually did not dare to go out casually. After marrying Cui, she hurriedly moved to Tianjin with him and rented a house to live in. Who knew that their love affair was limited, and Chengchi unfortunately died of illness in Tianjin in the 13th year of the Republic. Xi Kui mourned him constantly, and was so sad that she wanted to die. However, because Cui still had a daughter, she had to fulfill her responsibility to raise her. A few years ago, I traveled to the old capital and heard that because the expenses in Tianjin were relatively large, Liu moved with his beloved daughter to a certain alley near Luomashi Street outside the Qianmen in Beijing. Every day, she ate vegetarian food, recited scriptures, and taught her daughter to read. Her footprints never left her house, and she did not interact with people. The neighbors only heard the sound of wooden fish after midnight, and they did not know that this person who was determined to guard her chastity was Liu Xikui, the martial and beautiful king who caused a sensation in Wan City 20 years ago. With her unparalleled beauty, she ended her remaining life with the bleak wind and bitter rain. Her chastity is rare even among noble ladies, let alone people in the pear garden? The filial piety and righteousness of Kui Guan and Gan San were inspired by a moment, so they seem to be easier to do. However, Xi Kui's self-improvement with morality day and night, which has lasted for a long time, is undoubtedly more difficult? (119)
