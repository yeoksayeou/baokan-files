(Chongqing) Today, the Chinese military authorities expressed satisfaction with the results of the recent counter-offensive by the Chinese army in Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces. It is reported that the Japanese army is currently defending Nanchang with a large force, even though the city has in fact lost its military and political importance. The Chinese army's strategy is not to attack the Japanese army's strongholds, but to harass the weaknesses in the Japanese army's line, with the Japanese army's position near Xianning being the weakest. The Chinese army has advanced to Echeng. Echeng is southeast of Wuchang, which indicates that the Japanese army's defenses along the Yangtze River are very "weak." According to military authorities, guerrillas are currently very active in Anyi and Yishi, and have completely surrounded the Japanese defense forces in these two locations. Meanwhile, the Chinese army has also recovered Linqing in southern Hebei and charged into Jiukou on the east bank of the Hanshui River. However, the Chinese army that entered Jiukou withdrew immediately due to the lack of reinforcements. (United Press dispatch from the 13th)

(Yichang) The Chinese army on the front line of the Hanyi Highway has launched another fierce eastward advance.

Although telegraphic communications have not been disrupted, no reports have been received until last night. The Japanese side claims that 50,000 to 60,000 Chinese troops on that line have been surrounded. The Chinese side says that this is Japanese propaganda and an exaggeration. Foreign observers believe that at least the communication between Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway and Xiangyang west of the Hanshui River has been temporarily cut off, but the Chinese army has been quite successful on the Hankou-Yichang Highway. It is rumored that 700 Japanese corpses were abandoned on the battlefield west of Yingcheng. (Every News Agency dispatch from the 13th)

The trade of local foreign merchants is now encountering difficulties. Two ships of the Taikoo Company that arrived here were unable to unload their cargo because the coolies dared not go out to work.

Editorial

### What Should Shanghai Citizens Do Now?

In the past two days, the streets of Shanghai have been covered with joint announcements from the authorities of the two concessions, banning all political activities of groups. Every Shanghai citizen will naturally pay close attention to such a personal environment, and will also have various different feelings. However, it is hoped that the citizens will have the following common understandings:

1. The current situation in Shanghai is very tense. European and American observers also say: "Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the Shanghai situation is the most serious at present." It is possible that Shanghai citizens will fall asleep peacefully tonight, and when they rub their eyes in the morning, the situation will have changed. Under such circumstances, the measures taken by the concession authorities are certainly well-intentioned. We can savor the authorities' painstaking efforts and sincerity in being responsible for protecting the lives and property of the residents in the wording of the announcement, and this point should be acknowledged by all residents within the concessions.

2. The concession authorities' issuance of such an announcement is certainly not without reason, and it is definitely not a suspicion of the residents in the concessions, preventing them from taking any actions detrimental to the authorities' governance. So, what is the intention of the announcement? It is undeniable that the so-called banning of political activities of groups is nothing more than the so-called Chinese patriotic actions that the Japanese side has repeatedly warned the concession authorities about and babbled about endlessly. However, we do not need to embrace pessimism, thinking that the concession authorities' measures this time are an indication of abandoning Shanghai. We should say that this is a way for the concession authorities to maintain the concessions, rather than saying that this is issued for the Japanese side. According to a Washington telegraph on the 12th, the United Kingdom and the United States are now working closely together to prepare to formally respond to Japan's final demands regarding the Shanghai International Settlement. It can be seen that the binding of the residents this time is nothing more than a proposal to "avoid giving cause for criticism"; we should calmly and peacefully accept this proposal; for example, a parent saying to others, "You don't need to interfere in my family's affairs, I have already tied up my family members," we cannot regard this sentence as belittling the family. Of course, the Shanghai concession authorities will never protect the residents' political activities, but we cannot infer from this that the authorities have recognized the oppression of evil forces.

3. The joint announcement issued by the two concession authorities can be said to be an ordinary but also extraordinary thing. Because in order to cope with a special situation, the concession authorities must consult their respective national governments, and will never make their own decisions; the joint announcement this time clearly shows that the relevant countries are brewing a joint action, preparing to take a consistent approach in dealing with Japan's demands. From the Washington telegraph cited above, it can be seen that the United Kingdom and the United States have already cooperated closely; as for the unity between the United Kingdom and France, that is beyond doubt. Looking at it this way, in the Far East issue, democratic countries also have some glimmer of hope.

4. What the authorities are banning is all political activities of groups, which shows that non-political activities of groups are not prohibited. Since losing the leadership of the government, the citizens of Shanghai have maintained a calm attitude, and there are fundamentally no political activities of groups to speak of. As for all legal, non-political group organizations, they are very common, and the citizens of Shanghai have originally regarded this kind of organization as a way to contribute their strength. For example, fundraising, donations, and disaster relief work are often carried out using existing groups, and the citizens of Shanghai have done their best in this, implementing the so-called "those who have strength contribute strength, those who have money contribute money." Currently, Shanghai citizens can still work hard in this kind of work, without having to be discouraged at all, because the concession authorities will not be hostile to legal, non-political organizations.

5. The object of the so-called "banning political activities" is very general, and both positive and negative extreme actions and organizations are subject to the ban. Today's Shanghai citizens, on the one hand, sympathize with the authorities' painstaking efforts and forgive the necessity of their measures; but at the same time, they also deeply understand that the authorities will inevitably severely punish all illegal political activities and organizations. We firmly believe that the wise authorities will make "fairness" the highest principle of all measures and will never disappoint the residents.

In addition to understanding the above points, what actions must Shanghai citizens take in order to coordinate with the understanding?

First, every Shanghai citizen should vow to himself that although there are no group activities, they will never live in ease, never evade, and, based on their own position, exert their conscience and strive for the freedom to love the country and love the nation at any time and any place. You must know that people who love the country and love the nation are never afraid to do any kind of work; but they are most afraid of having no work.

Second, since the concession authorities have not shown any indication of compromising or succumbing to evil forces, Shanghai citizens should cherish the authorities, and with a united attitude and firm strength, support the authorities, and maintain the spirit of not compromising and not succumbing, to be the embryo of the Far East international united front.

Thousands of Casualties in Chongqing Bombing

(Chongqing) As a result of last night's Japanese bombing, there were thousands of casualties, with a number similar to that of last Thursday. (According to official statistics, the number of casualties last Thursday was over 7,000, with approximately 2,000 deaths and 5,000 injuries). Furthermore, Jiangfucheng on the north bank of the Jialing River and Tanchizi (transliteration) on the south bank of the Yangtze River suffered extremely heavy losses last night. It is reported that Chongqing residents, after the intense bombing by Japanese planes last week, mostly fled to the aforementioned two locations, believing that Jiangfu and Tanchizi (transliteration) would not be subjected to the Japanese planes' devastating bombings. Who knew that last night, the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes almost all landed in the aforementioned two areas. As a result, there were four fires in Jiangfu and two fires in Tanchizi (transliteration). The devastating bombings of Jiangfu and Tanchizi (transliteration) have greatly increased the relief work in Chongqing. The refugees who had fled to those two areas are now crossing the Jialing and Yangtze Rivers again this morning to return to Chongqing. Chongqing officials originally thought that the work of evacuating civilians had been completed, but now the refugees are returning, almost negating all previous efforts, and they feel helpless. The only solution now is to transport these refugees to the countryside. However, it is reported that some refugees intend to stay here and are unwilling to relocate again. But the police and military authorities will, according to new rules, strive to prevent this trend. (Associated Press, 13th)

(Chongqing) Today, the local government announced that twenty-seven Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing last night, of which three were shot down by Chinese anti-aircraft artillery. One of them has already been found on the bank of the Jialing River. (Reuters, 13th)

(Chongqing) Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing last night, seemingly mostly concentrated on the east bank of the Yangtze River where it merges with the Jialing River. A small town on the north bank of the Jialing River seemed to be targeted by Japanese planes, but according to rescuers who crossed the river last night to aid the injured, the number of casualties was still low, only around 300. Many civilians immediately fled the town when the alarm sounded. After the air raid, a large fire suddenly erupted near the French naval barracks, destroying the office of the American trading company, Weili Han Shipping Company, which was only 200 yards from the barracks. French sailors assisted the Chinese fire brigade in controlling the fire, preventing it from spreading to the French barracks. (Reuters, 13th)

(Chongqing) Five foreigners and one Chinese person attempted to cross the Yangtze River by boat last night to investigate the fire near the French naval barracks on the opposite bank. The boat collided with a steamer in the middle of the river, nearly capsizing. The five foreigners were French Chargé d'Affaires Nager, Belgian Chargé d'Affaires Tessan, former Belgian Chargé d'Affaires Hewen, who will soon leave Chongqing, Havas News Agency Far East Manager Beril, and Havas Chongqing correspondent Belat. The boat they were traveling in was broken by the collision, and all five foreigners fell into the turbulent Yangtze River. Fortunately, they were all good swimmers and were rescued unharmed by another boat shortly afterward. The accompanying Chinese person did not know how to swim but clung to a broken piece of wood from the boat and floated on the water, also being rescued, although he suffered injuries. (Reuters, 13th)

(Chongqing) Minister of Health Yan Fuqing stated that as a result of the Japanese air raids on Chongqing on May 3rd and 4th, a total of 5,000 civilians were killed, and 2,000 were injured. A total of 2,391 houses were destroyed by Japanese planes. Yan also mentioned the losses on the Chinese side in the current war, saying that the deaths and injuries of Chinese soldiers now exceed one million. In addition, there are six million children who have gone missing due to their parents being brutally murdered by the Japanese or for other reasons and must be cared for by the state. The number of refugees who have been forced to leave their homes and relocate elsewhere now exceeds 50 million, of whom 16 million belong to the impoverished class and need to be supported by the state. Yan also mentioned the lack of doctors and nurses, saying that China only has 9,000 trained doctors and 6,000 nurses, and there is a great shortage of both types of personnel. Currently, there are 300,000 beds in army hospitals for treating wounded soldiers and 20,000 medical personnel. (Reuters, 13th)

Strict Precautions to Prevent Further Attacks

(Chongqing) Today, the Chinese authorities, in order to prevent Japanese pilots from finding their bombing targets, are specifically advising foreigners to pay special attention and not to light fires during air raids. Even smoking cigarettes and using lighters are prohibited. Because during air raids, the entire city becomes a dark world, and a spark of fire may cause misunderstandings by the Chinese police and lead to serious disputes. Police and soldiers have received orders to manage the entire city when Japanese planes are conducting air raids. Except for journalists and rescue workers, etc., who have passes and can move freely in the city, all other people must go to bomb shelters or hide at home. According to the authorities, even a tiny fire will attract a crowd of Chinese soldiers who will surround the area and investigate the cause of the fire. The authorities also stated that they are currently taking extremely strict precautions, and senior officials will lead police officers to patrol the city. (Associated Press, 13th)

Bishop Shang Speaks About His Experience of the Attack

(Chongqing) After Chongqing suffered indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes, Catholic churches also suffered heavy losses. Bishop Shang, who witnessed the various atrocities of the Japanese army, was moved by righteous indignation and made a speech while filming the actual situation of the bombing, lodging a serious protest. The original words are translated as follows: "During the air raid on May 4th, the Chongqing Catholic Church also suffered great losses. The place where the bishop was located was hit by two very powerful bombs, leaving two large holes seventeen meters deep on the ground. Several houses immediately collapsed, burying twenty-five people alive in the rubble. Among these twenty-five people, one was a teacher at the Bible school, and fifteen were students. The St. Joseph's Church nursing home and poor people's hospital were hit by two bombs, killing eighteen people. The St. Misae Church and school buildings were also completely destroyed by two bombs, killing six people. Many cities in China have already been subjected to brutal bombing. Now such a tragedy has occurred in Chongqing. Several prosperous commercial centers have been burned down in an instant, killing and bombing more than 6,000 people. Anyone who sees this terrifying situation cannot remain neutral. If someone tells me not to speak, it is simply a great sin. No matter what, there is still a voice of justice and humanity in the world, and my conscience is a reflection of this voice. Therefore, I cannot but join all those with human emotions in seriously protesting these irrational atrocities." (13th dispatch)

(Chongqing) Catholic Father Bai Wan De broadcast to Europe in French at 5:30 AM on the 15th through the Central Broadcasting Station, describing the Japanese planes' destruction of foreign property. It is heard that the wavelength used by the station for broadcasts to Europe is 25.21 meters. (13th dispatch)

### Widely Rumored in Japanese Newspapers: Secret Treaty Concluded Between China and the Soviet Union; Soviet Union Agrees to Lend China 400 Million Yuan

(Tokyo) The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" and "Yomiuri Shimbun" both published news of the secret conditions of the treaty allegedly concluded between the Chinese and Soviet governments in prominent positions. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" Warsaw dispatch stated that after the Soviet government and General Chiang Kai-shek concluded the secret treaty, the Soviet Union will provide China with a loan of 400 million yuan to purchase military supplies, and half of the 100 million yuan will be used to jointly establish a Sino-Soviet military supplies import company. The Soviet Union also agreed to provide the Chinese government with unlimited pilots and mechanics. Today, the "Yomiuri Shimbun" published a Nanjing dispatch stating that one of the prices the Soviet Union is demanding for assisting China in its war against Japan is that China must consult with Moscow before accepting any third-party mediation. Other Soviet demands include: (1) Absolutely cracking down on the pro-peace faction within the National Government and other controlled areas; (2) Uniform distribution and treatment of the Central Army, the Communist Army, and the provincial armies; (3) Allowing the Soviet Union to develop resources in the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang, with only the Communist Army stationed in these three provinces, and establishing a special administrative region, appointing Communist leader Mao Zedong as chairman, and a Soviet military officer stationed there as a military representative; (4) Hiring Soviet experts as military instructors to train soldiers and pilots; (5) Establishing land and air routes between Xi'an, Moscow, via Lanzhou, Hami, and Dihua. After General Chiang Kai-shek received a report from Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, regarding negotiations in Moscow, he approved these concessions in Chongqing in April. The Soviet Union will then provide unlimited material and technical assistance to China in return. (Reuters, 13th)

### Britain and Turkey Fight Shoulder to Shoulder to Safeguard Peace in the Mediterranean; Turkish Prime Minister Announces the Conclusion of an Agreement Between the Two Countries to Save Europe from the Calamity of War

(London) This dispatch, receiving a detailed telegram from the Turkish capital detailing last night's Turkish parliament meeting, is extremely gratified. The telegram said that when Dr. Sertan, Secretary-General of the People's Party and current Minister of the Interior, announced the establishment of the Anglo-Turkish agreement in the crowded chamber, his speech was sincere and touching, arousing the patriotic enthusiasm of the entire chamber and expressing gratitude for the friendship of Britain. His slogan was, "I ask the parliament to allow us to advance shoulder to shoulder with Britain. Britain's goal is to save the world from the calamity of war." Later speakers all echoed the doctor's sentiments. Last night, Prime Minister Bayar addressed the parliament, earnestly stating that the Anglo-Turkish agreement is of utmost importance in Turkish history. Recent changes in events have been as swift as lightning. The government originally intended to maintain a neutral policy, but when the turmoil spread to the Balkans and involved the security of the eastern Mediterranean, Turkey encountered danger and could not maintain its neutral policy. The Mediterranean should be open to all countries for free navigation on an equal basis. Any attempt to interfere with this freedom endangers Turkey's security. Turkey is determined to cooperate with other countries and is willing to fight shoulder to shoulder with all countries seeking to maintain peace, if necessary. Dr. Oyeh, the recently retired ambassador to Britain, also addressed the audience, detailing the recent events in Europe in a way that was shocking. The doctor said that a good country was erased from the world map in twenty-four hours. Romania was threatened with an ultimatum, and Albania's independence was suddenly deprived by Italy. Italy now occupies islands close to Turkey and stockpiles large amounts of troops and war materials on the islands, which endangers Turkey's security. Other parliamentarians also praised Britain's tireless efforts to defend the security and independence of all countries and its intention to resist aggression with force if necessary, saying that this spirit and determination are admirable. They also said that the Turkish army and navy, together with Britain's great military power, will surely safeguard peace in the Mediterranean, and no one will dare to resist them. The parliament then unanimously passed a vote of confidence in the government and pledged to consolidate friendly relations and cooperate sincerely with Britain. (Reuters, 13th)

Turkish Capital. The National Assembly met this afternoon, and Prime Minister Sertan immediately reported on the negotiations between Turkey and Britain, briefly stating that the two sides had decided to conclude a reciprocal agreement to ensure the security of both countries. The National Assembly immediately expressed its unanimous approval. The following is a summary of Prime Minister Sertan's speech:

The Prime Minister first said that the government's policy originally focused on maintaining peace and preserving neutrality. Now, the security of the Mediterranean coast and the Balkan Peninsula has been threatened. In order to protect the security of the country, it cannot stick to the old rules and maintain a neutral policy. All countries that have interests on the Mediterranean coast hope that it recognizes this sea as a common sea. Based on this, efforts to maintain order on the Mediterranean coast so that the interests that the countries concerned should enjoy are not deprived. No country shall establish hegemony. It is related to the safety of all countries concerned. Furthermore, the peaceful cooperation of all peace-loving countries will not hesitate to fight when necessary. This is the only effective way to avoid the scourge of war. The government now asks the people to agree to cooperate with Britain for peace and security. This is not aimed at any country, nor is it intended to surround any country. It is only intended to prevent the holocaust of war for the whole nation. "If the rights and interests of our country are threatened, we will defend ourselves by force without hesitation." Our country is also conducting friendly talks with France in order to conclude an agreement similar to the Anglo-Turkish agreement. As for the Soviet Union, "that country is our strong neighbor. The friendship has always been good. In the future, we will still maintain close and sincere relations with it. The interests of the two countries are the same. The views are unified, and it will be easy to unite." (Havas, 12th)

Details of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement Awaiting Discussion; Passage Through the Straits is Not a Problem

(London) Regarding the conclusion of an agreement between Britain and Turkey, well-informed sources here recently stated that the main details that remain to be resolved are the issue of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits. The method of navigation through these straits has been determined by the 1935 Montreux Convention. At this time, it is necessary to find a way to adapt the Anglo-Turkish agreement to this method. It is generally believed that this matter is very easy to resolve. The fact that British fleets can pass through these straits in wartime is practically certain. As for the agreement being negotiated between France and Turkey, the main point that remains to be resolved is the issue of cooperation between the two countries' fleets in wartime. In short, British and French military experts will soon go to the capital of Turkey to thoroughly study the issue of navigation through the straits and cooperation between the fleets with the Turkish authorities. (Havas, 13th)

Extremely Important Political Nature; Another Achievement of British Diplomacy

(London) After Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons yesterday that Britain had agreed with Turkey to conclude a mutual assistance agreement, political figures here were extremely pleased, saying that this was another victory for British diplomacy. Responsible people also attach great importance to it and said that in the future, if there is an aggression that could cause a war on the Mediterranean coast, even if Britain is not directly subjected to aggression, it can obtain Turkey's assistance. If war breaks out in Europe, whether Italy participates or not, it will definitely spread to the Mediterranean coast. It can be asserted that the nature of this agreement is extremely important to Britain, which is evident here. (Havas, 12th)

(London) "The Times" published an editorial today commenting on the value of the Anglo-Turkish agreement, stating that this agreement is an extremely important political event, and its importance lies in the following four points: (1) Turkey is the manager of the Dardanelles Straits, and its alliance with Britain is of great importance to maintaining peace in the Mediterranean; (2) After the conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish agreement, it is easier to achieve the goal of creating a Balkan group. As long as the obstacle of Bulgaria is overcome in the first step, it will not be difficult for the Balkan countries to conclude a group; (3) Turkey is a strong country in Asia, and its influence on the Arab countries is very important. After the recent incorporation of the Hatay Republic, the obstacles to Franco-Turkish understanding should be completely eliminated; (4) Finally, the establishment of the Anglo-Turkish agreement is of great benefit to Anglo-Soviet relations, because the Soviet Union does not have to worry about its isolated position if it is attacked. (Haitong, 13th)

### France Reserves the Right to Conclude a Similar Agreement with Turkey; Turkey Demands the Cession of the Sanjak Region as a Prerequisite for Cooperation Between the Two Countries

(Paris) After Britain and Turkey decided to conclude a mutual assistance agreement, France and Turkey will conclude a similar agreement, and the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can also be accelerated. Various newspapers here have recently commented on this, saying that the above agreement is of great strategic importance. Although Germany has tried to obstruct it in many ways, it has not been effective, and it can be said to have suffered a setback. The right-wing "Morning Post" stated that the content of the Anglo-Turkish agreement is said to have two main points: If Turkey is attacked, Britain will provide assistance; If the mandated territories of Egypt and Palestine are attacked, Turkey will provide assistance. As for France, although it concluded an agreement with Turkey in 1927 to guarantee the territorial integrity of the Syrian Republic under French mandate, it still needs to conclude an agreement with it to join the Anglo-Turkish mutual assistance mechanism. "The Soviet Union and Romania have concluded agreements with Turkey, so that in the event of war in the future, warships from the Soviet Union, Romania, Britain, and France can freely pass through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits, while the enemy countries cannot." The moderate "Order News" published an article by the famous reporter Bettinax, which stated that the former German Prime Minister Papen was recently appointed as the ambassador to Turkey, and his main task was to prevent Turkey from concluding an agreement with Britain. "Unexpectedly, this agreement was finally concluded, and Germany has suffered a major setback here." From another point of view, Turkey may not have readily accepted the British restraints without obtaining Soviet consent. It is not known how the relations between the Soviet Union and Western European countries will be in the future. It is recalled that during the opening of the European War, the German cruiser "Goeben" took refuge in the Dardanelles Strait. The negotiating countries saw it but could do nothing about it, and the strategic situation in the Mediterranean also changed because of this. At that time, Turkey and Germany and Austria were in collusion. Although Britain and France wanted to supply Russia through the Dardanelles Strait, they were unable to do so as they wished. "Now that Turkey is cooperating with them, Western European countries can freely enter and exit the Black Sea." Moreover, Turkey has agreed to cooperate in defending the Syrian Republic and the regions of Palestine and Egypt, but it demands that the Sanjak region (which belonged to Turkey before the European War and was assigned to Syria after the war, was divided into an autonomous region by the Franco-Turkish agreement last year and placed under Turkish sovereignty as an exchange condition. In our opinion, we should weigh the pros and cons. All the important problems, no matter how important they are, should not be equated with the most important problems." The right-wing "Figaro" reported that Britain had just concluded an economic agreement with Romania and concluded an agreement with Turkey. Germany made every effort to obstruct it diplomatically, but to no avail. The German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, also tried in vain to entice and threaten the Turkish government. Looking at Turkey's strategic agreement with the Soviet Union and its mutual assistance agreement with Britain, the current negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union can be given new impetus within the scope proposed by Britain, and the staff talks advocated by the Soviet Union can also be followed up. The Socialist "People's News" stated, "Under the guidance of Propaganda Minister Goebbels, German newspapers have said that democratic countries only know how to talk, while the Axis powers of Germany and Italy can act. Unexpectedly, democratic countries also have their own ways of acting. They do not boast, but they have also achieved something." (Havas, 13th)

(London) This morning, various newspapers here mentioned the possibility of France ceding the Sanjak region of Alexandria to Turkey as a prerequisite for mutual assistance between France and Turkey. The "Times" diplomatic correspondent said that only a few points remain to be resolved, and then the affairs of the Sanjak region can be finally decided. The "Times" also based its Paris dispatch on an editorial stating that it is not inappropriate to predict that the Sanjak region of Syria will soon be incorporated into Turkey. This development should eliminate the last obstacle to France and Turkey establishing a mutual assistance leap, imitating the British-Turkish method. The political reporter for the "Daily Herald" also took a more prudent tone on the prospects for a resolution after the Sanjak issue is resolved, and did not directly mention the nature of the resolution, but said that this issue is expected to be resolved in time so that it can be submitted to the League of Nations Executive Council for approval. The "News Chronicle" also has a record of the Sanjak region being ceded to Turkey. (Reuters, 13th)

### Paris Welcomes

(Paris) Prime Minister Chamberlain's official statement regarding Turkey today was warmly welcomed here. France's declaration is not yet ready. Its delay is due to the fact that the Franco-Turkish negotiations on the Mediterranean Sea and Alexandria's Sanjak assistance have not yet been completed. (Reuters, 12th)

### German and Italian Displeasure

(Berlin) A German spokesperson today criticized British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons regarding Turkey, saying, "We do not distrust Turkey, but it is of no benefit for Turkey to be enticed to abandon its traditional policy of not endangering itself or anyone else, and to join Britain's encirclement." German political figures stated that every successful decision of British policy equals a new threat to world peace. The "Hamburger Tageblatt" stated that if Britain and France wish to implement their guarantees to Greece and Romania, they must control the Dardanelles Strait, and that the price of buying Turkey into the encirclement line will surely include France ceding the area of ​​northern Syria to Turkey. (Reuters, 12th)

(Berlin) German political figures commented on Britain and Turkey's decision to conclude an agreement, saying that Britain is newly afflicted with "treaty-itis", and this is another clear proof. Prime Minister Chamberlain's talk of war is "extremely careless". German officials said that the late Turkish President Kemal Atatürk strictly adhered to neutrality in his foreign policy during his lifetime, but the current government is now going against this, and will regret it too late. Germany and Italy will not be discouraged by this. (Havas, 12th)

(Berlin) Regarding the Anglo-Turkish agreement, the tone of various newspapers here today is that this is a further move by Britain to encircle the Axis powers. The Nazi Party's "Völkischer Beobachter" analyzed the effect of the Anglo-Turkish agreement and the Anglo-Polish agreement, saying that the Anglo-Turkish agreement is an encirclement policy aimed at Italy, and the Anglo-Polish agreement is aimed at Germany. The "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" commented that the Turkish government's National Assembly had just approved Germany's loan of 150 million marks to Turkey the day before yesterday, and suddenly announced the conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish agreement yesterday, which shows that Turkey has suddenly abandoned its neutral policy. This is the result of pressure from Western European countries, and Turkey has also been involved in the wave of Mediterranean encirclement. The "Essener National-Zeitung" asked, "As a result of the Anglo-Turkish agreement, Turkey will fall into the encirclement policy. Do Turkish political figures also know this? This move occurred after Turkey expressed its neutral policy to Germany, which is very infuriating." (Haitong, 13th)

(Rome) Italian political figures interpreted British Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration regarding Turkey today as an insidious action aimed at making Turkey protect British interests in the eastern Mediterranean. They believe that British public opinion is quite confused due to the slow progress of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, so this declaration was issued to appease them. Fascist Party members expressed doubts about the possibility of an Anglo-Soviet compromise. (Reuters, 12th)

### Harmonious Relations Between Greece and Turkey, Convergent Policies

Athens. Newspapers here today published news of the decision by Britain and Turkey to conclude an agreement, praised the speech delivered by the Turkish Prime Minister in the National Assembly yesterday, and spoke of the harmonious relations between Greece and Turkey. Political figures said that the agreement to be concluded between Britain and Turkey has no aggressive goals and is not hostile to any country, which is in line with the foreign policy pursued by our country. (Havas, 13th)

### Germany's "Three B's Policy" Utterly Failed

Warsaw. Various newspapers here commented on the decision by Britain and Turkey to conclude a mutual assistance agreement, believing that this was a major failure for Germany. The government's "Polska Gazeta" stated, "Britain has agreed on a mutual assistance agreement with Turkey, and has also established a commercial agreement with Romania. This is truly a serious failure for Germany. From now on, Germany will not only lose Romania's oil, but also be unable to touch the oil produced by Iraq and Iran. Germany's 'Three B's Policy' has completely failed." (Note: The Three B's Policy refers to the route from Berlin to Baghdad through Belgrade.) The "Warsaw Post" stated, "After Britain concluded a mutual assistance agreement with Poland, it also negotiated an agreement with Turkey. This is Germany's first major failure. Today, Germany only has two paths to follow: one is to submit willingly, and the other is to fight to the death." (Havas, 13th)

### Papen's Mission to Divide the Anti-Aggression Group Is Disgraceful

(London) The decision by Britain and Turkey to conclude a mutual assistance agreement has been unanimously emphasized by the newspapers here. They said that the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union should be encouraged as a result. "The Times" stated, "This diplomatic achievement of Britain must be brought into full play to promote Anglo-Soviet negotiations. At the same time, the agreement that France and Turkey should sign should also be completed as soon as possible based on the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, without any obstacles." The Labour Party's "Daily Herald" stated, "Germany had exhausted its efforts to prevent Turkey from joining the anti-aggression group and to promote the signing of an agreement with Germany to break the group. This diplomatic policy was disillusioned due to the establishment of the Anglo-Turkish agreement, and the German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, who was responsible for the mission of division, can be described as an unfortunate German diplomat. In this regard, Britain must actively take various steps to enrich the strength of the peace alliance. In this way, Britain's second move will also be easier. Among them, the most effective and important one is to cooperate with the Soviet Union with all its strength." (Havas, 13th)

### Mussolini to Deliver Speech in Response to Remarks by British and French Prime Ministers

(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini is scheduled to travel to Turin tomorrow morning to deliver a speech.

At the same time, he will also address the speech made by the British and French Prime Ministers the day before yesterday and make various demands to France. (Havas, 13th)

### France Has Great Determination to Defend National Freedom, Foreign Minister Bonnet Delivers Speech in England, French Chamber of Deputies Passes Vote of Confidence in the Government

Sands End Port, England. French Foreign Minister Bonnet and his wife flew here from Paris at 11:15 this morning. They immediately attended a banquet of the "French Expatriate Friendship Association" and delivered a speech, saying, "To this day, the French nation has made a major determination, which is almost known to all countries in the world." If a person cannot enjoy dignity, freedom, and security in the world, then he has no value. Since France has this determination, the various colonial peoples under its responsibility can live and work in dignity, freedom, and security. This is an immutable theory. Moreover, France is determined to pursue peace, but its strength is very strong. On the one hand, it cooperates closely with Britain, and on the other hand, it is still prepared to cooperate with other countries. Foreign Minister Bonnet concluded, "Britain and France have provided guarantees to countries that are determined to defend their freedom and rights. As for the promises and signatures they have provided, they will know how to respect them in the future." (Havas, 13th)

(Paris) When the Chamber of Deputies discussed foreign policy today, Socialist leader Blum delivered a speech, stating that although the party agreed with Prime Minister Daladier's declaration regarding the current foreign policy, it was difficult to trust the government because the government had promulgated various substitute legal orders, which only increased the burden on the working class and revised various social legislations. After the Chamber of Deputies discussed the results, it finally passed the vote of confidence by 375 votes to 230 votes. Except for the votes against by the Socialist and Communist Party members, all other members voted in favor. (Havas, 12th)

### Germany and Italy's Joint Military Strength, Roman Newspaper Boasts, Claiming They Cannot Be Matched by Britain and France

(Rome) The "International Relations Magazine" published an article today, emphasizing that the German-Italian axis has 25 million soldiers, and its strength is so strong that it cannot be overcome by others and is a tool to guarantee peace. "The strength of Germany and Italy extends from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Mediterranean, Libya, and the coast of the Indian Ocean in the south. There are 150,000,000 people, all equipped with elite weapons and prepared to defend themselves to the death when necessary." As for the air forces of the two countries, they are also among the most powerful air forces in the world. Their submarine force is far stronger than that of the two Western European countries. "It can be seen that the political and military articles agreed upon by the diplomatic authorities of Germany and Italy in Milan the other day are a powerful guarantee of peace. Recalling that in 1918, Western European countries attempted to use the Treaty of Versailles to establish an unfair and absurd hegemony, now things have changed and those countries have had to make concessions to Germany and Italy based on the principles of justice and reciprocity." (Havas, 13th)

### General Göring Returns Home After Touring the Mediterranean

(Rome) German Aviation Minister General Göring, who set off from San Remo, Italy, on the 8th of this month to tour the western Mediterranean, has recently returned to Livorno, Italy, and immediately took a special train to return to Germany. (Havas, 12th)

### Amendment to the League of Nations Covenant, Member States Divided into Active and Ordinary Categories, This Session of the Executive Yuan Will Submit for Discussion

(London) A diplomatic source here recently stated that this regular session of the League of Nations Executive Council may discuss the issue of amending the League Covenant. This proposal will be initiated by the Soviet Union or one of the Balkan states, and supported by Turkey. The current proposed plan is to divide the League of Nations member states into "active" and "ordinary" categories. The former must accept mutual assistance obligations, while the latter does not. British political figures commented that this plan, although not as good as the general collective security system advocated by the former Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, is better than the three-nation agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to implement a partial collective security system and is quite favored by the Soviet Union.

(2) Appoint Japanese ministers to Romania, Hungary, and some other countries in the near future so that they can collect information on European developments.

Its content advocates authorizing the President to issue a declaration, announce a state of war, designate belligerent countries, and delineate dangerous areas, prohibiting American citizens and merchant ships from entering at will, otherwise they will bear all risks themselves. Accordingly, the belligerent countries can purchase munitions and raw materials from the United States and entrust them to American merchant ships for transportation. Even if these merchant ships suffer damage, the American government will not bear any responsibility. In addition, the financial provisions of the current Neutrality Act, such as the ban on lending to belligerent countries in cash or on credit, should still be preserved. (Havas, 12th)

### Latvia Determined to Maintain Independence, Foreign Minister Explains Policy

Riga, Latvia. Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of Latvia's implementation of authoritarian rule under the leadership of President Ulmanis. The Economic Committee and the Cultural Committee jointly held a celebration. Foreign Minister Munters attended the meeting and delivered an important speech, saying that the German government had suggested to our country and the Estonian government that they sign a non-aggression treaty separately. Our country and Estonia have accepted this, because concluding this treaty does not conflict with our country's policy of maintaining neutrality and independence. Taking the example of the Soviet Union also signing non-aggression treaties with its neighbors, if our country's territory is attacked after the treaty is signed, it will naturally rise up to resist. In addition, any treaty that shakes our country's independence will also be resolutely rejected. As for the current international issues, the key to solving them lies with the great powers, but if small countries can maintain two conditions, as our country has done, they can also stay out of the disputes. What are the conditions? One is to strictly maintain neutrality, and the other is to have the determination and necessary strength for self-defense, so that when any great power attempts to conquer this "stubborn" neutral country, it can rise up to resist. "As for our country's determination for self-defense, there is no doubt about it. No matter which country invades our borders, our people will unite to resist it." Moreover, our country's current conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with Germany is beneficial to the security of Northeastern Europe. What should be recognized is that our country has never accepted secret constraints from any country politically or militarily. In the future, in order to cherish the freedom and independence of our policy, we will never accept any constraints and bear obligations. "Estonia is our allied country. After the foreign affairs authorities of that country and I recently exchanged views, we all agreed that Germany's proposal is in line with the neutral policies of our two countries and does not conflict with the existing obligations between our two countries, and decided to accept it." In addition, as far as the Soviet Union is concerned, maintaining Latvia's independence is a blessing for the Soviet Union, so it has always been valued by that country. This can be confirmed without doubt after the meeting between our country's ambassador to the Soviet Union and that country's diplomatic authorities last month. (Havas, 13th)

Today, while Polish people in Danzig were commemorating General Piłsudski's ceremony, National Socialist Party crowds rioted in the streets, destroying a Polish hotel, smashing the glass windows of a Polish newspaper distribution office, and throwing stones at General Piłsudski's portrait. The Danzig Senate, controlled by the Germans, expressed its apologies to the Polish authorities for the recent bombing that destroyed the houses of Polish customs officials and for the attack on a Polish stationmaster by armed National Socialists in Mariana, causing him serious injuries.

### Brief Biography of Piłsudski, Continued from the Seventh Page of the 12th

Carried out propaganda and organizational work among young people and workers. He was imprisoned again in 1900, but escaped the country with the help of friends. After that, he engaged in the organization of Polish expatriates in England, Germany, Switzerland, France, and other countries. In 1902, he returned to Kraków to organize an army. When the Great War began in 1914, Piłsudski allied with Russia against Germany and was arrested again. After the war, a revolution occurred in Germany, and Piłsudski regained his freedom. On November 9, 1918, he returned to Poland and immediately organized a government and established a national army. Poland was able to restore its independent status from then on. He was publicly elected as the national leader. Several months after the restoration of the country, Poland fought with the Red Army to protect its borders. The war lasted for two years, and the Red Army was finally driven out of Polish territory. After the war, he resigned in 1923 due to misunderstandings among the leaders of various small parties and retired to the suburbs of Warsaw for three years. In 1926, party struggles in Poland became more intense, and Piłsudski regained power, created new methods, and became one of the great figures in the world. He struggled for fifty years, and worked hard for the country every day. Poland's present state is due to Piłsudski's contribution. (End)

### Franco Inspects Air Force: Italian and German Volunteer Airmen Awarded for Meritorious Service

Madrid: A grand review of Spanish, German, and Italian aviation personnel who participated in the Spanish Civil War was recently held at Barajas airfield. Five hundred and six aircraft were parked on the field, though none took off. Forty thousand spectators attended, including air attachés from the British, French, Italian, German, and Japanese embassies. First, General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, presented medals to sixteen German and seven Italian airmen. He then delivered a speech, praising the combat achievements of the German, Italian, and Spanish airmen. He stated that Spain's current air force strength was unimaginable at the start of the civil war, and that "it should be increased a hundredfold, as the air force is the steel arm for building an empire and must be expanded to the fullest extent so that Spain can become a great nation." He then shouted, "Long live Spain! Long live Italy! Long live the German and Italian volunteers!" which concluded his speech. The audience responded in unison, their voices echoing far and wide. The review then commenced, with the German airmen leading, followed by the Italian airmen, and the Spanish airmen bringing up the rear. (Havas Dispatch, 13th)

### China Again Appeals to the U.S. to Prohibit the Shipment of Military Supplies and Raw Materials to Japan; At Reception for Guests at the New York World's Fair, Powerful U.S. Congressmen Express Sympathy for China

(New York) Yesterday, at a reception for guests at the Chinese section of the New York World's Fair, many influential American congressmen attended. The Chinese side took the opportunity to request that the U.S. Congress prohibit the supply of American munitions and raw materials for munitions to Japan. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui also sent a telegram, roughly stating, "We hope that the United States, in addition to upholding international justice as in the past, will now take action to refrain from participating in acts of aggression." Yu Zongqi (transliteration), the Chinese Consul General in New York, also stated, claiming, "The American people are largely unaware that Japan obtains most of the weapons used to bomb China directly from the United States, and they also do not realize that Japan's actions are sufficient to shatter America's future dream of peace." U.S. Congressman Nichols responded, "Since China has given us such rich cultural treasures, we should, of course, also give the Chinese people equal help." He concluded, "The U.S. Congress is completely opposed to war." (Associated Press Dispatch, 13th)

### Theft Occurs at Residence of Chinese Consul General in the Philippines; Family Heirlooms Swept Clean

Manila: Police authorities announced today that a theft occurred last night at the residence of Yang Guang-sheng, the Chinese Consul General here, with ornaments worth tens of thousands of pesos stolen. The incident unfolded as follows: Mrs. Yang had just returned from Europe last week. The thieves seemed to have known that Mrs. Yang had returned home and broke into the Yang residence, opened the jewelry box, and swept away all the ornaments inside. According to Mr. Yang, he cannot estimate the value of the stolen ornaments because many of them are family heirlooms of unknown value. Police officers also said that the thieves were very cunning, but they were unwilling to reveal whether they had found any clues. (Associated Press Dispatch, 13th)

The wheat seedlings on both sides of the He Lv and Jishan highways have been forcibly cut down by the Japanese troops in recent days, incurring the deep hatred of the people, who are rallying under the banner of "protecting food supplies" and launching attacks. Recently, the Japanese troops have dispatched several armored vehicles to patrol the highways at night to prevent Chinese attacks. In Xin Jiang, on the morning of the 7th, Japanese troops brutally killed all twenty-one Chinese soldiers captured earlier outside the city.

### Japan Attempts to Occupy Concessions; U.S. Government Expresses Determination; Authorizes Diplomatic Representatives to Handle Everything; No Official Report on Gulangyu Incident

Authorities of Both Concessions Issue Announcements Voluntarily

Authorized Representatives to Deal with Incidents

Washington, Associated Press, 12th: Secretary of State Hull told the press yesterday that the U.S. diplomatic representatives are now authorized by the government to handle all kinds of difficulties that have occurred locally in Shanghai and elsewhere. Hull stated that he had not received any news regarding the statement made yesterday in Shanghai by a Japanese naval spokesperson that the Japanese military might deem it necessary to occupy the British and American defense zones of the Shanghai International Settlement. Hull declined to comment on the possible attitude that the American authorities in Shanghai would take if the Japanese were to attempt to occupy the International Settlement.

Possible Economic Sanctions

Haitong News Agency, Washington, 13th: Authoritative American sources remain silent on the Japanese military's occupation of the Gulangyu International Settlement, but political figures are paying close attention, fearing that the Japanese military will take the same steps in Shanghai. According to political figures, if Japan were to disregard consequences and occupy the Shanghai Concession, the United States might take economic sanctions against Japan.

Washington, Reuters, 12th: After news of the Japanese military's occupation of Gulangyu was transmitted, an spokesperson for the State Department said that the United States is related to the public concession in that area and will pay close attention to its development.

No Report Yet on Gulangyu Case

Haitong News Agency, Washington, 13th: U.S. Secretary of State Hull met with reporters yesterday and gave a talk regarding the Japanese military's occupation of Gulangyu, stating that the U.S. government cannot yet judge the importance of the Japanese military's action because it has not yet received an official report from U.S. diplomatic representatives in China. When reporters asked if the U.S. would intervene if Japan took similar steps in Shanghai, Hull replied that the U.S. authorities in China had received instructions from the government on how to deal with emergencies. Finally, when reporters asked what the mission of U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew's visit to the Japanese Foreign Ministry yesterday was, Hull replied that he did not know whether Grew's visit to the Japanese Foreign Ministry was due to his own initiative or at the invitation of the Japanese government, but that Washington had no such instructions. London, Havas News Agency, 13th: According to sources close to the Foreign Office, the landing of Japanese troops on Gulangyu, China, does not violate international treaties, and the British government is unlikely to protest. However, the matter will be treated differently if the Japanese military authorities interfere in the administration of the public concession there or infringe upon the rights of foreign residents.

News from foreign sources: The U.S. destroyer "Bulmer," currently in Fuzhou, has been ordered to sail to Gulangyu and is expected to arrive there today. The British destroyer "Tracker" has not yet received any reports of British property losses.

### Japan Intends to Occupy Public Concessions

The China Press reports that at a reception for reporters yesterday (the 12th), a Japanese naval spokesperson, in response to questions about the related effects of the occupation of Gulangyu and the possible consequences for Shanghai, said that if a serious incident occurred, the Japanese side might find it necessary to occupy the public concessions in Shanghai. The spokesperson, in discussing the occupation of Gulangyu, emphasized that when an assassination attempt occurred on the island, the commander of the local Japanese fleet was also on the island, so it was necessary to protect him. Regarding the suppression of anti-Japanese activities, the Japanese side had protested to the Gulangyu Municipal Council several times in the past, but they had not taken any action. When asked if the occupation was temporary, the spokesperson replied that he personally believed so, but unless the Gulangyu Municipal Council took appropriate measures to satisfy the Japanese side's demands, the Japanese marines might be forced to

Remain There.

If so, the controversy would become more complex. Japanese soldiers have not occupied the Municipal Council building or public utilities, but are merely patrolling the streets. A reporter asked if the Japanese military was expected to occupy the public concessions in Shanghai. The spokesperson replied that if a serious incident occurred, it might be necessary. A reporter pressed, asking if they would occupy the areas managed by foreign troops at the same time. The spokesperson stated that this

Would Depend on the Situation,

but he was unwilling to discuss the matter. When asked if the occupation of Gulangyu would abolish the status of the public concession there, the spokesperson was unable to answer this question. A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy declared that the announcements issued on Thursday by the Municipal Council and the Board of Directors of both Shanghai concessions were an effort to meet Japanese demands to suppress terrorism and control other

Sabotage Activities.

How the authorities of both concessions will strictly enforce their announcements, and how effective they will be, remains to be seen. A reporter asked if the Japanese side would reserve its attitude towards this appeasement policy. The spokesperson did not give a definite answer to this, but considered it a step forward towards satisfying Japanese demands. The naval spokesperson also responded to questions about the Italian ship "Derbyshire," which recently carried wheat, medical supplies, and a medical team to Ningbo, and was

Detained by the Japanese.

The spokesperson said that the Japanese authorities do not welcome the transport of "all items that may help prolong the anti-Japanese resistance of the Chiang regime." Genuine medical supplies are not prohibited, but chemicals used for other purposes besides treating the sick and wounded will not be allowed to be transported from the Japanese-occupied areas to Ningbo and Wenzhou, which are still held by the Chinese side.

Regarding the Joint Announcement Incident

The Continental Times reports that a spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession stated yesterday (the 12th) that although the Japanese side strongly claimed that the joint announcement issued by the Municipal Council and the Board of Directors on Thursday was the result of recent special demands from the Japanese side, this was not the case. The decision of both concessions was entirely their own, but the Japanese side had previously requested the issuance of this order. According to a spokesperson for the Japanese side, who met with reporters yesterday afternoon, the Japanese authorities regard this announcement as a definite step towards

Greater Understanding

between the Japanese side and the two foreign-administered districts, and now it remains to be seen how the spirit of this announcement will be implemented. The spokesperson made this statement after claiming that the announcement was a direct result of the multiple protests made by the Japanese authorities to the Municipal Council and the Board of Directors regarding terrorism and anti-Japanese activities in the two districts. Although the Chinese-language newspapers have not yet commented on the issuance of this announcement, it has already aroused widespread criticism from various Chinese circles. A prominent

Chinese Business Leader

told reporters that given the current unrest in the two concessions, Chinese residents here would not feel overly endangered by the policy adopted by the Municipal Council, but there is no doubt that this is a major concession by the local administrative authorities to the Japanese side. A Chinese banker expressed his approval of the spirit of the issuance of the announcement. It is claimed that he hopes that the Municipal Council and the Board of Directors will match their words with their deeds. If the announcement is treated as law

Not Only Applicable

to Chinese groups, but also applicable to people of all countries, including Japanese and puppet Chinese, then he would be satisfied with it, even though he does not hope for this announcement. His only fear is that the two bureaus will suppress the Chinese in the foreign-administered districts, while being extremely tolerant of the Chinese of the puppet regime under Japanese pressure. If the Chinese here engage in political activities, it must be known that

Puppets Conduct

Such Activities Even More. If foreign-administered districts hope to maintain their neutrality, they must simultaneously prohibit the puppet groups here. There were also a small number of residents who discussed the matter with reporters, expressing indignation at the actions of the Municipal Council and the Board of Directors. One stated that they should not forget that the National Government of China is recognized by all countries, and that the representatives of the various countries here are trying to suppress the so-called "political activities" of Chinese residents.

### The Rice Problem is Severe: The Primary Need is to Open Up Supply Sources. The Rice Evaluation Committee's Suggestions are Pertinent and Concise. Illegal Backroom Transactions Occurred Again Yesterday.

Since the Bean and Rice Market Management Committee strictly implemented price controls, the market situation once trended toward stability. However, recently, rice-producing areas such as Wuhu have again prohibited the export of rice, leading to scarce supply sources and unrest among market participants. Illegal backroom transactions and violations of price limits have reemerged. The Evaluation Committee reissued a public notice yesterday, posting it in the market and sending letters to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to send representatives to participate and provide guidance. As for the authorities in the concessions, they are reportedly still considering ordering foreign rice. Detailed information is recorded below:

Market Transactions Exceed Price Limits

The bean and rice market had been trending toward stability since strict price controls were implemented. The market opened as usual at 9:00 AM yesterday. However, recently, rice-producing areas such as Wuhu have again prohibited the export of rice, leading to unease in the market. Yesterday, there were again illegal backroom transactions exceeding price limits. The highest price for white rice reached 15.78 yuan, or even 16 yuan. In addition to continuing to enforce price controls and vigorously urging price stability, the Market Management Committee is also conducting strict investigations and reporting to the Evaluation Committee. Anyone who reports violations at any time will be severely punished to protect the people's food supply.

Public Notice to the Market: Strict Enforcement

To strictly enforce price controls, the Rice Evaluation Committee reissued a public notice yesterday, posting it in the market, stating: "This Committee is addressing the rice price problem with both short-term and long-term measures. We have already sent letters to the Chamber of Commerce and the authorities of the two concessions, requesting them to send representatives to participate and provide guidance at any time. We have also suggested ordering foreign rice and opening up inland sources of supply. We will await their replies to follow their instructions. Regarding price limits, it was resolved on the 9th of this month that transactions in this market must comply with the price limits set by the joint meeting of rice industry groups on the 5th of this month. Any violations should be strictly enforced by the Market Management Committee according to the price limits. However, recently, we have heard of backroom transactions exceeding price limits, which is highly inappropriate. All rice industry groups and the Management Committee should conduct strict investigations. Anyone may report violations at any time. If there is no material evidence but there are credible witnesses, they may also report it. Once verified, severe punishment will be imposed. This matter concerns the people's food supply and will not be tolerated. This notice is hereby issued."

Considering Ordering Foreign Rice for Shipment to Shanghai

To prepare for contingencies, the Rice Evaluation Committee has specifically suggested that the authorities of the two concessions order foreign rice for shipment to Shanghai to supplement supplies and open up domestic rice sources to protect the people's food supply. It is reported that the concession authorities have agreed to consider ordering foreign rice and will first submit it to the Joint Rice and Grain Committee for research. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the rice industry yesterday that domestic rice from Wuhu, Wuxi, and other places has been monopolized and prevented from being shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, opening up sources from these two places is practically difficult. It is hoped that the concessions will find ways to open them up, as it is beyond the rice industry's power. Ordering foreign rice at current prices and shipping it to Shanghai would not only be unprofitable but would also incur losses.

Request to Send Representatives to Provide Guidance

In addition to suggesting that the authorities of the two concessions order a large quantity of foreign rice for shipment to Shanghai to supplement supplies and requesting them to send representatives to participate and provide guidance, the Committee also sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating (the suggestions to the concession authorities are omitted above): "Since February, we have been exerting ourselves, but the future is long and the prospects are worrying. This is truly beyond the capacity of this Committee. The only remedy is to earnestly request that your esteemed Chamber send representatives to participate and provide guidance at any time so that the rice industry has instructions to follow and the market situation can be stabilized. We believe that your esteemed Chamber, for the sake of the food supply of all citizens, will surely agree to participate. Secondly, seeking price stabilization, price limits, investigation, and registration are all stopgap measures. The fundamental solution lies in seeking abundant sources of supply. If the sources are blocked and we rely solely on existing reserves, even strict price limits will be difficult to maintain without failure. In today's situation, there are only two ways to seek abundant sources: one is to request that the concession authorities, following the precedent of previous years, order a large amount of foreign rice for storage in Shanghai, so that the people's food supply will be secure and rice prices will be easily suppressed; the other is to request that the concession authorities find ways to open up inland sources. The focal point of rice and grain in Jiangsu Province is Wuxi, and in Anhui Province, it is Wuhu. Traditionally, Shanghai's food supply of both japonica and indica rice has been largely sourced from these two places. Now, these two places have successively prohibited the export of rice and grain. The main reason for the recent scarcity of supplies in Shanghai and the rise in market prices is this. Rice merchants would spare no effort to purchase and transport if there were even slight profits to be made, but they are constrained by the situation and can only lament their helplessness. Only by relying on the concession authorities to find ways to open up these sources, ensuring that a substantial amount of rice from Wuxi and Wuhu is transported to Shanghai daily or monthly, continuously and without interruption, will the effect be equivalent to ordering foreign rice. This has already been suggested by this Committee to the concession authorities, to choose one of these two options for implementation, which would be far superior to various stopgap measures. The above-mentioned matters, one being the earnest request for your esteemed Chamber to participate in the organization of the Evaluation Committee, and the other being the suggestion to the concession authorities to order foreign rice or open up inland sources, are all urgent matters at present. In addition to sending letters to the two concession authorities, we have specially prepared this letter to earnestly request your consideration and approval to send representatives to participate and provide guidance. We are deeply grateful."

Concession Authorities Attach Great Importance

Regarding the request from the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee to order foreign rice and invite participation in the evaluation, it was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the French Municipal Council of the French Concession, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations yesterday morning. Today is the regular Sunday holiday, and the request will be translated into English and French by the two authorities tomorrow before being submitted to the Joint Rice and Grain Management Office and the Rice and Grain Adjustment Office established by the concessions for detailed research. After opinions are signed, it will be submitted to the regular board meeting convened by the Municipal Council on the 16th of this month for discussion. Before the meeting, the authorities will convene representatives of the rice industry to seek their opinions. Various rice industry groups are awaiting instructions from the authorities for handling. According to observations from relevant parties, the current market price of foreign rice is quite high. If purchased and shipped to Shanghai, including tariffs, the price would be over 16 yuan per 180-jin scale (equivalent to one dan). If import tariffs can be reduced or waived, the cost will be reduced, and distribution and sales would not only replenish grain reserves but also suppress the price of domestic rice, which would be an excellent fundamental solution. The urgent task is to find ways to open up the sources of production areas in the interior and facilitate shipment to Shanghai. If we only order foreign rice and do not pay attention to domestic rice sources, it will be difficult to achieve balance in the future regulation of the people's food supply.

### Reports of Chen Lifu Advocating Peace Aim to Confuse the Public

According to sources with connections to political circles, the "New Shen Bao" in Shanghai published reports claiming that Chen Lifu had made statements advocating peace in Chongqing and was suppressing Communist activities. Such bizarre reports are clearly aimed at confusing the public and dividing the forces of the central government, and are not worth taking seriously. Since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, Mr. Lifu has been encouraging all party members and compatriots to unite spiritually and work together for the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction. His contributions to the party and the nation have been significant, and therefore the enemy's hatred for him has deepened.

### Five Chinese Citizens Abducted: Letter Requesting Negotiation. Disregard for Police Authority, Endangering Order.

The United Office of Shanghai Organizations sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession regarding the abduction of five Chinese citizens on the 9th of this month: "Dear Sirs, Reports in various newspapers on the 10th of this month stated that at 12:00 noon on the 9th of this month, five Chinese citizens were having lunch at the Flurie Jewish Chicken Restaurant on Guangxi Road when more than ten Japanese plainclothes personnel suddenly arrived and abducted them to Hongkou. After careful investigation, this has been confirmed as fact, which caused us deep concern. It is not necessary to delve into the reasons why the five Chinese citizens were arrested. Even if there is evidence of guilt, they should be tried through legal procedures. The fact that they were abducted and secretly arrested is shocking. In the past two years, Japanese authorities have frequently abducted Chinese citizens in the concessions without authorization. Such disregard for the police authority of the concession authorities not only leaves the lives and safety of Chinese citizens without any protection but also endangers the public order and good governance of the entire concession. If this trend is not curbed, it will make all citizens in the concession feel insecure. The five Chinese citizens have no connection with our organizations, but our hearts are filled with concern, and we cannot remain silent. Therefore, we are sending this special letter to your esteemed Association, hoping that you will send representatives to request the Municipal Council to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese authorities as soon as possible, demanding the immediate release of the abducted five Chinese citizens and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not occur in the future. This matter concerns the lives and safety of four million Chinese citizens in the concession. We respectfully request your attention and handling. Sincerely, The United Office of Shanghai Organizations, May 12th."

### Ningbo Bombed for the Seventh Time: Over a Hundred Houses Destroyed, More Than a Dozen Killed or Injured

Ningbo was bombed by Japanese aircraft for the seventh time at noon on the 12th. On that day, seven Japanese aircraft came and dropped sixteen bombs. The bomb-drop locations included the Girls' High School, Jicao Street, Tianyang Lane, Dahe Road, Lotus Lane, Qita Temple, Yaoxing Street, in front of the County Government, Xiaoshi Lane, Maiyu Lane, and other places. Over a hundred houses were destroyed, and more than a dozen people were killed or injured.

### Guerrilla Force Raids Huacao Town

The commander of the joint guerrilla force of Jia, Shang and Qing counties, personally led several dozen soldiers from the Second Directly Subordinate Brigade under Commander Zhu at approximately 3:00 AM yesterday morning, taking advantage of the darkness to raid Huacao Town in western Shanghai. They began attacking the Japanese soldiers stationed in the town with machine guns. Residents in the Xujiahui area could also clearly hear the gunfire. The Japanese soldiers, awakened from their sleep, hastily responded to the attack and suffered many casualties. It took approximately two hours for reinforcements to arrive from Beixinjing. By then, dawn had broken. Commander Yao, seeing that his mission was complete, withdrew peacefully. Before leaving, they arrested Zhao Jiayou (26 years old, a native of Huacao), the former head of the local self-government association, executing him on the spot and displaying his head as a warning.

### Fresh Pork Slaughter Suspended: Meat Industry Completely Suspends Sales. Respecting City Image, Will Not Close Doors. Hoping Authorities Will Properly Handle Aftermath.

Due to the illegal seizure and blockage of fresh pork supplies by the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou, the slaughterhouses in the two concessions have suspended slaughter. The fresh meat industry has been forced to suspend sales but will not close their doors out of respect for the city image of the concessions. However, they hope that the authorities will properly handle the aftermath. The details are recorded below:

Fresh Pork Shipments to Shanghai Have Disappeared

After the fresh pork industry declared its stance and vowed not to participate in illegal organizations, fresh pork shipments to Shanghai from the New Harbor were repeatedly illegally seized by the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou. Negotiations between suppliers and the shipping companies failed, causing suppliers to view shipments to Shanghai as a long-distance burden, depleting their resources, and virtually cutting off the supply. Japanese warships in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have also been obstructing British ships from loading fresh pork. Although protests were lodged with the Navy without success, various transport suppliers, lacking protection, have sent telegrams to cease operations one after another. As a result, since last week, shipments of fresh pork to Shanghai have disappeared.

Slaughterhouses Suspend Pork Slaughter

The pork slaughterhouses in Shanghai are the Suxi Slaughter Company located at No. 50, Lane 1050, North Chengdu Road in the Public Concession, the Xinninghai Slaughter Company located at No. 4, Lane 1050, North Chengdu Road, and the Municipal Slaughterhouse of the French Concession located at No. 296, Avenue Foch. Usually, these three companies collectively slaughter 2,500 pigs per day. Now, due to the disruption of fresh pork supplies, there are no pigs to slaughter, and they have been forced to suspend slaughtering pigs starting from the morning of the 13th. They had already slaughtered all the remaining pigs in storage on the 12th.

Fresh Meat Shops and Stalls All Suspend Sales

There are over two thousand fresh meat businesses in the Public Concession and the French Concession, including meat stalls, divided into four major groups: Suxi, stealing from Shanghai. Because pigs shipped to Shanghai by the fresh pork industry have been detained by the "Livestock Market," resulting in a disruption of supply and no goods for sale, and after separate discussions, they have decided to temporarily suspend sales starting today. However, they will not close their doors out of respect for the city image of the concessions and have advised employees to stay in the shops and not go out, encouraging them to follow the motto "Do not make empty talk, do peaceful things." They have universally advised the industry to comply and strictly prohibit secret hoarding and sales.

Forced by Circumstances, Will Not Close Doors

The soaring prices of fresh meat in the market have led industry leaders to earnestly advise against raising prices. Yesterday's market prices were 1.125 yuan per jin for wholesale and 1.25 yuan per jin for retail leg meat, and 1.1875 yuan per jin for streaky pork. However, because the supply of fresh meat has been disrupted, over five hundred meat stalls in the two concessions have voluntarily suspended operations. Therefore, the number of meat stalls in various small markets has decreased significantly. As for the meat shops and stalls that are barely operating, they will have no meat to sell after the 15th. However, in accordance with the industry's decision, they will not close their doors.

Hoping Authorities Will Properly Handle the Aftermath

Yesterday, inquiries with the fresh pork industry and the fresh meat industry revealed that shipments of fresh pork to Shanghai have been blocked and illegally seized by the "Livestock Market," causing the fresh pork industry to wire suppliers in Jiangbei to stop shipments. Slaughterhouses have been forced to suspend slaughter, and the fresh meat industry has been forced to suspend sales, affecting the entire Shanghai meat supply. However, as this is a forced situation, they hope for understanding and sympathy from all sectors. Hereafter, they only hope that the authorities of the two concessions will promptly arrange proper measures to handle the aftermath and maintain the business of legitimate merchants, so as not to affect the meat supply of millions of citizens.

The Puppet Faction Detains Pigs: No Place to Hoard Livestock

The "Livestock Market" of the Japanese puppet organization, after being rejected by the fresh pork industry in this city, is implementing a conspiracy of oppression. It has unified the transportation of inland pigs, shipping them to Shanghai on Nissin Company ships and colluding with the Jilin Feng Customs Brokerage for smuggling and tax evasion. Any fresh pigs transported by pig merchants on any foreign shipping company are subject to detention by the Japanese naval authorities or forced to stop loading. Although the puppet "Market" is now shipping over two thousand pigs from the New Harbor daily, originally intending to monopolize sales in the Shanghai market, it has been unable to sell them due to the industry's unanimous rejection and monitoring to prevent the sale of pork from unknown sources. Therefore, the puppet "Market" has no way to sell them, and the number of live pigs that have not been slaughtered is increasing daily. There is no place to hoard livestock. According to news from the "Market," the Japanese puppets are very anxious about this. Several pigs die every day. The weather is hot, and if swine fever is discovered, it will have a serious impact on Shanghai's sanitation. Currently, the industry hopes that citizens will not be greedy and buy cheap fresh meat from unknown sources, which could harm their health.

Beef, Mutton, Chicken, and Duck Industries' Expressions

Inquiries with the beef, mutton, chicken, and duck industries in this city revealed that the oppressive methods of the "Livestock Market" in illegally controlling the transportation of livestock are becoming increasingly serious. Fresh pork has already been forced to suspend sales. How will they cope if this behavior is applied to the beef, mutton, chicken, and duck industries? Each industry has expressed that they are already suffering greatly from the oppression of the illegal "Market." However, out of respect for human dignity and to maintain a legitimate business stance, in addition to strictly warning all members of the industry not to participate in the puppet "Market" and vowing not to cooperate, if the puppet faction uses the same means of oppression against the fresh pork industry to oppress the beef, mutton, chicken, and duck industries in the future, they will only sacrifice their business to resist.

### Puppet Police in Nanshi Uprising: Heading Towards the Shanghai-Minhang Highway; Now Joined the Guerrilla Force to Fight Against Japan

Six puppet police officers from the Nanshi Branch of the puppet "Police Bureau" suddenly revolted last night (the 12th), carrying weapons. Upon hearing the news, Wang Zhizhang, the head of the puppet branch, urgently telegraphed the Kikuchi Unit of the Japanese garrison to dispatch troops to pursue them. The revolting puppet police officers had already headed towards the Shanghai-Minhang Highway along Guohuo Road. The Japanese army was unable to catch up, making a fruitless round trip and achieving nothing. It is said that the puppet police suddenly decided to revolt because they could not withstand the oppression of the Japanese army and resolutely made this decision. They have now joined the guerrilla force to fight against Japan.

### Strict Tax Customs Orders in Vietnam: Travelers Encounter Hardships at the Border; Fines are Imposed for Carrying Razor Blades and Matches; There Are Even Cases of Passing Paper Money During Handshakes

Recently, those traveling by sea to Sichuan and Yunnan must pass through French Vietnam. The tax customs orders in that area are extremely strict, and travelers often unknowingly violate the prohibitions by carrying personal items, leading to endless troubles. The current issue of the *China Weekly Review* contains a letter from John D., which details the prohibitions of the Vietnamese tax customs, and is translated below so that travelers can read it and take precautions:

I read an article in your issue of April 29, which detailed the grievances of Chinese travelers passing through Vietnam due to various treatments, to draw public attention to it. Several of my friends have personally experienced it, so I can verify the various points mentioned in the article. I will briefly describe one or two of them, which I believe readers will be happy to hear.

I recently received a letter from a gentleman who had been received by the Chinese Consul General in Haiphong. Therefore, he was not disturbed when he passed through the tax customs, but he witnessed the treatment of several of his fellow passengers. They clearly did not carry new items in their luggage or on their bodies. Only two or three shaving razor blades were allowed, and even new toothbrushes had to be taxed. Matches were absolutely prohibited. If a traveler happened to carry a matchbox, they sometimes had to pay a fine according to the number of matches. Shirts that had been ironed were also considered new and taxed. A certain passenger was fined 5 piastres (equivalent to 10 Chinese yuan) for carrying two cans of fruit, as the regulations only allowed one can. The behavior of the Annamese people is often more extreme than that of their French masters. Those who are well-dressed seem to be treated more harshly than the average person. The assessment of taxes and fines seems to be without any set rules. If travelers try to explain or argue, the fine is immediately doubled. If they continue to argue, it is doubled again. If they do not pay the fine, they are threatened with imprisonment. The writer of the letter did not know that this threat was being implemented.

Bribery is Rampant

As many expect, according to the letter, there are various ways for travelers to receive better treatment. The suitcase carried by a traveler is often emptied of all its contents onto the dirty floor so that customs officials can inspect it. After the inspection, the traveler naturally has to repack it themselves, and no one will help. Several travelers, in order to avoid this disturbance, put paper money into prohibited matchboxes, which were then confiscated. There are also those who hide paper money in their palms before shaking hands with customs officials. I believe that your publication of these facts will indeed be beneficial to the Chinese people in Shanghai and other places.

### Reward Measures for Volunteer Reserve Team of Fire Brigade

The Municipal Council has formulated a method of awarding medals to reward the long-term service of members of the Volunteer Reserve Team of the Fire Brigade. Any team member who has served for twelve years and is proficient in practical work can be recommended by the supervisor to apply for a medal. After that, an additional ribbon can be issued every five years. The style of the medal is the same as that of the police medal for the sake of uniformity.

### Naked Cooperation: Performing Naked Dances at the Banquet; Director of Japanese Intelligence Agency Performs in Shanghai; Shocking News from Tokyo's *Kokumin Shimbun*

The current issue of the *China Weekly Review* contains an interesting anecdote, saying that former Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Kawai, now serves as the director of the Intelligence Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo. He recently visited Shanghai. At that time, British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, and British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, were in Shanghai for talks. The Chinese newspapers pointed out that Kawai brought huge sums of money to Shanghai to help the anti-British movement, as the thirty newspapers published in the areas occupied by the Japanese army suddenly made the same anti-British propaganda. But Tokyo's major newspaper, *Kokumin Shimbun*, carried even more shocking news (see the newspaper on April 30), saying that Kawai was entertained in Shanghai by several Chinese friends, namely those serving in the "Greater Shanghai City Government." During the banquet, the initiator's speech advocated that China and Japan should "cooperate in East Asia." Kawai said that if China and Japan want to achieve this "cooperation," they must embrace a "naked" will towards each other. To make people understand the meaning of his saying, the former Consul General took off his clothes at the banquet and performed a naked dance in front of his Chinese hosts. *Kokumin Shimbun* also said that the Chinese were deeply moved when they saw this, and Kawai's popularity increased because of this ("Greater Shanghai City Government").

### After Negotiation, *De Ping* Released; Resuming Sailing to Wenzhou Tomorrow Night; *En De* Returns to Shanghai from Wenzhou

The Italian merchant ship *De Ping* of the Sino-Italian Company, after being detained by the Japanese, was released on the evening of the 12th of this month as a result of negotiations by the Italian Consulate in Shanghai. The ship is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou tomorrow night (the 15th). Also, after the company's ship *En De* resumed sailing on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, the ship returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou yesterday morning and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon (the 14th). The three ships *Golden, Wilkinson,* and *Tinball*, which are still detained, are being negotiated separately by the German and Italian Consulates. Once the negotiation procedures are completed, they will be released soon.

### Belgian Reporter Arrested after Returning to Japan from Shanghai

Foreigners in this city received news from Tokyo, Japan, that two Belgians were arrested by the Tokyo Japanese police. One is B. Yan (transliteration), 70 years old, a reporter for a newspaper in Paris. B. had just returned to Japan from Shanghai on April 20. The other is C. Reller (transliteration), 38 years old, currently a Catholic priest. He was arrested two days ago. According to reports, the reason for the arrest is engaging in trade for profit, which violates the law.

### Consul Corps Secretary Long Returns to America on Vacation

The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that the Secretary of the Consul Corps in this city, Mr. Long, is scheduled to leave Shanghai in early June and return to the United States for a half-year vacation. He has recently transferred his position as Secretary to Mr. Paer of the Italian Consulate General. Mr. Long has served in China for over twenty years and has been Secretary of the Consul Corps for eleven years. Paer has been in Shanghai for five years, first as a representative of an Italian aviation company, and three years ago, he joined the Italian Consulate General in Shanghai. This appointment was recommended by the Italian Consul General and is temporarily serving as Secretary of the Consul Corps. After six months, when Mr. Long returns to Shanghai to resume his duties, Paer will continue to serve at the Italian Consulate General.

### Abundant Funds in Shanghai, Lack of Investment Opportunities, Commodity Prices Rise by 18% This Year, International Trade Imports and Exports Both Decrease

——Annual Report of Shanghai Banks——

The Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank's report for 1938 (27th year of the Republic of China) stated: "This year, the domestic economic situation suffered unprecedented misfortune due to the spread of war. The losses are the greatest in our country's history. Furthermore, the economic conditions in various regions have experienced various abnormal phenomena due to the different impacts of the war. Generally speaking, both production and consumption have declined. As for the economic situation abroad, the conditions in various countries are quite uneven due to different environments and policies, but the signs of recession seem to be more common. The domestic economic situation is now divided into financial, trade, commodity prices, and industry and commerce, and each item is summarized on the left."

Finance

"Following the financial panic of last autumn, the financial stabilization measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance continued to be implemented this year. The lending committee organized by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank also successively handled lending matters in various places. In addition, the government was determined to maintain the legal tender (fapi) throughout, and friendly governments and financial institutions in the United Kingdom and the United States also provided assistance whenever possible. Therefore, although the war situation deteriorated day by day, the financial market was able to remain as stable as usual. Not only was there no run on deposits, but also a large amount of previously fleeing funds returned. Financial institutions, with the exception of one or two small banks, did not go bankrupt. The Shanghai interbank offered rate did not fluctuate abnormally throughout the year, and even the unofficial market price of government bonds rose steadily. All of this was beyond our expectations and is gratifying. Under this relatively stable situation, there are also several important events that deserve our attention.

Black Market for Foreign Exchange

At the beginning of this year, the government still strove to maintain the statutory exchange rate. Later, due to environmental reasons, the "Foreign Exchange Application Procedure" was promulgated on March 14, stipulating that when banks need foreign exchange for legitimate purposes after offsetting receipts and payments, they must apply to the Central Bank for purchase. After the Central Bank approves it, it sells the foreign exchange at the statutory price, so as to moderately restrict the supply of foreign exchange. In June, it successively stipulated the types of goods that restrict imports, and the foreign exchange of export goods should also be sold to national banks. On August 8, it was stipulated that applications for foreign exchange for goods shipped and imported after January 1 of this year will no longer be accepted, except for necessities. The market's need for foreign exchange could not be fully met, and the so-called black market came into being. The unofficial exchange rate of the legal tender successively fell from one shilling and two and a half pence, reaching seven shillings and eight seven five pence in August. However, since the second half of the year, the exchange rate in this black market has often hovered above eight pence. After the establishment of British and American loans, it was expected to be firm, and it can be seen that the value of the legal tender, even under the control of the black market, can still maintain a considerable stability."

Transfer Discount

"The Shanghai remittance and currency exchange were originally scheduled for cash settlement the next day, but since the Ministry of Finance implemented the financial stabilization measures, the so-called interbank remittance was only for transfer of accounts, not for cash withdrawal, and could not be used to purchase foreign exchange. Since its use was restricted, a discount method was introduced if it was to be exchanged for cash. This was already evident in the second half of last year, and this year it became even more intense. Later, the Joint Reserve Board came out to maintain it and injected a large amount of funds, and it was restored. By the end of this year, the number of legal tender chips on the market has increased considerably, and the remittance discount has been trending downward. Therefore, since the outbreak of the war, the Shanghai financial market has added a new chip. Customers and firms often have to open two accounts, one for legal tender and one for remittance, which is also an abnormal phenomenon of wartime finance."

Remittance Obstruction

"This year, the war gradually moved westward, and transportation between Shanghai and the interior became increasingly inconvenient. Before and during the war, a large number of goods were transported from Shanghai to the interior, but it was not easy to transport a large amount of local goods out of the interior, and they were controlled by the government. The amount of money remitted from the interior to Shanghai far exceeded the amount remitted from Shanghai to the interior, so the exchange rate became increasingly high, and there was the pain of not being able to adjust remittances anywhere. In addition, the exchange rates between Shanghai and various ports in North China were also quite chaotic. Therefore, funds in various places are not easy to support each other, which is also affected by the war."

Shanghai Funds

"Since the war has left the Shanghai and Nanjing area, the number of people from the interior who have come to Shanghai to take refuge has increased day by day, and a large amount of funds from the war zone have flowed in. The funds used to purchase foreign exchange before and during the war have also returned due to earning interest by sitting idle. Therefore, Shanghai funds have gradually become abundant. Current deposits in the financial industry have increased considerably, and the number of chips on the market has become increasingly loose. Speculative undertakings have also risen accordingly. From the trading of foreign currency, gold, and stocks to the hoarding of various commodities, it is more prosperous than before the war. Using funds for non-productive purposes cannot but be regarded as a hidden danger in wartime economy."

Southwest Finance

"Since the government moved westward, the economic development of the southwest brooks no delay. In order to meet the needs of people in the interior, the major financial institutions in this city have opened branches in important locations in the southwest provinces, and the number of them has increased day by day. Many financial institutions in the war zone have also retreated to the southwest with the government, and people's funds have gradually been transferred in to supply local production undertakings. At present, Shanghai's funds lack investment opportunities. If they can be transferred to the interior under the principle of safety, it will be of no small help to the economic development of the southwest. All of the above are characteristics of wartime finance this year. Although it is not all satisfactory, if we understand the seriousness of this decisive battle and the vastness of its spread, we have to regard the stability of the financial situation this year as a rare phenomenon. The government's efforts to protect currency, stabilize finance, and maintain credit, as well as the cooperation of friendly financial institutions, have made great contributions." (To be read)

### Guerrillas Search Yantai Customs Patrol Boat, Haiqi, Japanese Side Unable to Catch Up, Seize Large Number of Machine Guns and Rifles

According to foreign sources, on the 7th of this month, the Yantai Customs patrol boat Haiqi was attacked by guerrillas, and a large number of machine guns and rifles were taken away. It is said that on the night of the 7th, two large sailing boats carrying a large number of guerrillas sailed near Yantai Harbor and boarded the Haiqi to search. Due to the dark night, and the guerrillas were quick in action, they were not subject to any resistance when boarding the ship, nor did they fire a single bullet. In a short time, they seized a large number of machine guns, rifles, and other weapons, and safely returned to the sailing boats. Before leaving, they fired several shots at the Haiqi ship to show their farewell. When the Japanese harbor personnel were informed, they immediately drove a small motorboat with Chinese customs sailors to chase after them. By that time, the sailing boats driven by the guerrillas had already left the port.

### Pseudo-Armed Police Force Discovered in Western Shanghai, Not Under the Control of the Pseudo-Police Bureau Chief, Directly Under the Jurisdiction of the Japanese Secret Service

The Japanese soldiers in western Shanghai have weak defenses. A newly established pseudo-"armed police force" of 500 people, carrying old firearms, is headed by a pseudo-"battalion commander" named Han Jun, who is not under the command of the pseudo-"police bureau chief Lu Ying, but is controlled by the Japanese secret service, in order to increase their defenses. It is said that these 500 pseudo-police officers are compiled from local rabble. Han Jun even blackmailed the Japanese side to organize a pseudo-garrison headquarters", so that he can get the position of pseudo-"commander", his ambitions are rampant.

### Mr. Yuan Ludeng Talks About Disaster Relief Undertakings, Still Relying On Donations From All Parties, Relief Committee Remits 70,000 Yuan to the Association as Part of the Relief Funds for Refugees

A reporter yesterday interviewed Yuan Ludeng, the secretary-general of the Refugee Relief Association, to talk about the recent situation of the relief undertakings. According to him, regarding the funds for relief chickens, thanks to the donations from all parties, they can be maintained. Recently, the Central Relief Committee remitted 200,000 yuan to Shanghai, which is distributed to the Shanghai Relief Association at 35,000 yuan per month, totaling 70,000 yuan. This money will be used as part of the relief funds for refugees. However, the relief undertakings are complex and involve thousands of strands, and they rely on donations from all parties to gather sufficient funds so that the refugees can get out of the water and fire as soon as possible. Refugee education is very important, and the association is planning to have proper measures. In the future, the elderly, weak, women, and children refugees will also be able to have a place to end their lives and a place for their children to return. Therefore, various plans are still awaiting the accumulation of relief funds to be gradually implemented.

### Comparison of Charitable Lottery Prize Money by Period, Eighth Period Ticket Sales Are the Best, A Total of 500,000 Yuan in Relief Funds Have Been Issued

The French Concession Refugee Relief Charitable Lottery has been issued for ten periods. Because it concerns the nature of relief and the methods are proper, its credibility has been increasing day by day, and its sales have been increasing sharply. Since the fourth period, the total amount of the ticket has been changed to half, and the whole ticket has been changed to five strips, sold at 5 yuan national currency. After each strip is sold at 1 yuan national currency, more and more people are eager to buy tickets. Now, the amount of the first prize and the total amount of relief funds to be provided for each period since the fourth period are compared as follows: (Fourth Period) The first prize is 41,750 yuan for the whole ticket, and 8,350 yuan for each strip, with 50,100 yuan in relief funds being provided. (Fifth Period) The first prize is 37,675 yuan for the whole ticket, and 7,535 yuan for each strip, with 45,210 yuan in relief funds being provided. (Sixth Period) The first prize is 39,000 yuan for the whole ticket, and 7,800 yuan for each strip, with 46,800 yuan in relief funds being provided. (Seventh Period) The first prize is 43,250 yuan for the whole ticket, and 8,650 yuan for each strip, with 51,900 yuan in relief funds being provided. (Eighth Period) The first prize is 44,750 yuan for the whole ticket, and 8,950 yuan for each strip, with 53,700 yuan in relief funds being provided. (Ninth Period) The first prize is 37,500 yuan for the whole ticket, and 7,500 yuan for each strip, with 45,000 yuan in relief funds being provided. The results of the above periods have been improving period by period, and it is believed that the eighth period is the best. The relief funds provided, together with the 100,000 yuan in the first, second, and third periods, have totaled more than 500,000 yuan in the nine periods, which has benefited the refugees greatly.

### Big Fire at the Intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Tiantong Road in Shanghai, Two People Died in the Fire, Five People Were Burned and Fell

At 2:30 a.m. yesterday morning, a fire broke out at No. 835, North Zhejiang Road, Tiantong Road, Public Concession. Black smoke was like ink, and the flames were soaring. At that time, it was the time for the wind to help the misfortune. In an instant, it spread to two buildings next door, No. 833 and No. 837. When the fire was raging, because it was late at night, residents could not escape in time, resulting in the burning to death of a family of three, a man, a woman, and a girl, namely Mao A Fa, 25 years old, Mao Xi, 48 years old, and girl Qian A Mao (10 years old). The three corpses were climbed out by firefighters in the rubble, their heads were charred, and they were unbearable to look at. There were also five people who were burned and jumped from the building and fell, namely Zhou Jingeng, 33 years old, injured in the left foot, Zhou Zhao, 34 years old, injured in the head and fracture of the left knee bone, Wu Xu, 33 years old, burned upper body, Qian Xi, 44 years old, burned left arm, and boy Wu Liuzi, 6 years old, fell from the window and seriously injured his head due to the burning of the ladder. The fire scene was driven by the Fire Department to the scene and tried to extinguish the fire until 4 o'clock. A total of three houses were burned and injured people were sent to Baolong Hospital by ambulance for treatment. The corpses were sent to the autopsy office to be autopsied.

### Pan Cheng's Assassination: No Political Connection, Dismissal of Messenger Led to Petty Hatred, Once Doused with Feces

Pan Chengjiong (also known as Pan Muzhong, 45 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 16, Datongfang, Lane 127, Yaozhu Jiao Road, French Concession), the chief of dispatch and receipt at the Great Northern Telegraph Company, was stabbed in the back twice and on the left cheek once with a sharp knife by Wang Chenggong (21 years old, from Shandong) at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday while passing the YMCA on Avenue Petain in the French Concession. After being wounded, Pan still chased the assailant to the corner of Caishi Street and Bali Bridge Street before collapsing due to his injuries. Officer No. 961 apprehended the assailant and took him back to the police station for investigation. Pan was rushed to Guangci Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 8:30 PM that night. All details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. After receiving news from the hospital that Pan had died, the French police immediately transported the body to the autopsy room at the Public Works Department Hospital on Avenue Talas. Pan's wife, Wang (48 years old, from Beiping), was notified, and yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Qian of the Second Special Court arrived to examine the body. According to investigators' reports on the incident, the wife requested to claim the body and requested a strict investigation of the assailant to avenge the deceased. The official declared that Pan Muzhong had indeed died from stabbing wounds, and the body was handed over to Pan's wife for burial. The defendant was handed over to the court by the police department for legal proceedings. It is said that the deceased was strict in his duties during his lifetime, which led to resentment.

Further news reports that the circumstances of the death of Pan Chengjiong, director of the dispatch office of the Great Northern Telegraph Company in this port, who was stabbed to death by a thug, have been published in various newspapers. However, the truth of his murder is rumored differently. It is now known that Mr. Pan has served in the telegraph industry for decades, has both good character and learning, and is serious in his work. He has always been admired by his colleagues, but he is stricter with his subordinates, which may have led to hatred and resulted in this unexpected disaster. Several months ago, a messenger was dismissed by Pan for violating regulations and harbored deep resentment. Later, Mr. Pan was splashed with feces by a rogue, which was due to this. Mr. Pan reported this to the police for legal action. This murder case is likely related to this matter. As for the leaflets that mentioned a political role, according to the company's colleagues, Mr. Pan was always loyal and law-abiding and worked hard in his duties. The rumors are absolutely inaccurate and must be the murderer deliberately playing tricks and trying to confuse the public.

After reporting to the Laozha Police Station, Chinese detective Wang Yingjie arrested the two Wus and sent them to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning.

### Embers Rekindle, Causing a Huge Fire, Investigation Reveals Cause of Fire on Guling Road, Old Servant Arrested and Prosecuted for Causing Disaster

No. 70 Guling Road is rented by Qian Jichen, who runs a cotton yarn business, so there are often piles of cotton yarn in the house. Shi Chenglang, from Tongzhou, is an old servant hired by Qian. Shi usually burns waste cotton yarn balls to remove the copper pipes from the balls for sale. Therefore, Shi's daily work is almost burning yarn to extract pipes. At 5:00 AM on the 11th of the month, Shi again placed the remaining cotton yarn ashes in a rush bag and placed it at the back door. Beside the bag, there was a large pile of paper. Unexpectedly, the yarn ashes had not been completely extinguished. After being blown by the wind, the embers rekindled and spread to the pile of paper next to it, immediately causing a large fire. With the help of the wind, it turned into a prairie fire, quickly spreading to the two-story loft of the house, where Chen Zubei, a small worker from the Water and Electricity Company, his wife Chen Yu, and their children Chen Qingqing (10 years old), Chen Yuqing (9 years old), and Chen Baobao (7 years old), and daughter Chen Jincai (13 years old) lived. Due to the intense fire, they could not escape in time. Only Chen Yu and Chen Baobao jumped out of the building and escaped. Chen was slightly injured, while Baobao was unharmed. Chen Jindi also escaped after being burned. However, Chen Qingqing and Chen Yuqing both died in the fire. After the fire brigade extinguished the fire, the injured were taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment, and the dead were taken to the autopsy room for examination. Afterwards, Chen Dabao, a Chinese detective from the Chengdu Road Police Station, found out the details and believed that Shi should be held responsible for this fire. However, Shi fled after the incident and was only arrested in Room 75 of the Tongshang Hotel on Avenue Albert yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case and prosecuted him for causing death by negligence under Articles 276 and 173 of the Criminal Law.

### Protect Our Lives

—Jun Peng

——Summer is the Season for Active Bacteria——

Time flies, the giant wheels of the era rush forward, and before our eyes is already summer, with the green of the banana trees and the redness of the pomegranates! In this summer, our lives are very dangerous because this period is the time when all pathogenic bacteria are most active. Perhaps you have not forgotten the "salesmen" of all pathogenic bacteria - mosquitoes and flies - they are the executioners of murderers, so protecting our lives is really not to be delayed! In addition, all the major camps of pathogenic bacteria - dirty places - must be cleaned up. We must allow them to live on the isolated islands where people from all directions mix. This year, the population has increased to five or six million, so special attention must be paid to summer hygiene.

Children! You probably all know the saying, "Disease enters through the mouth!" What is most precious to us? It is our lives. So, how can we protect our own lives? Only by paying attention to our own hygiene, which, in other words, means that everything must be clean. We must be extra clean, whether it is on our clothes, utensils, or everything in our homes. If there is any accumulation of dirt, all pathogenic bacteria can immediately parasitize on that thing, and at the same time, they will soon reproduce quickly - their descendants - increasing the executioners of murderers, expanding the major camps of murderers, and with a large number of mosquitoes and flies, taking the opportunity to be active and be their "salesmen." So, at all times, we have the possibility of being invaded by bacteria, which is extremely dangerous! We should know that guns and cannons are very powerful, but we can see them and can also dodge them. Of course, we can temporarily find a safe zone and preserve our lives. Only these pathogenic bacteria cannot be seen by our eyes, so there is no way to avoid them. Assuming that an epidemic occurs in a certain place, it can cause all the people within hundreds of miles around to get sick and die. This is not me scaring you, but the fact is indeed so terrible. We may be living in the atmosphere of the most terrible epidemic (Note). Now, however, science is prospering, so we can take precautions in advance - vaccination, immunization injections - so that even if bacteria come to attack, we will not surrender without resisting, or even die. It is a pity for an individual to die, but if the masses are also like this, wouldn't it be even more pitiful and terrifying? Only with a healthy body can we protect our own lives!

To protect our own lives, we must pay attention to hygiene ourselves. Like the garbage inside the house, it must be swept clean every day; the accumulated dirt on the desks and benches must also be wiped off every day; the things we eat must not be sucked by mosquitoes and flies, so we must cover them well; when we see mosquitoes and flies, we must absolutely exterminate them; we must not buy or eat smelly, rotten, and unclean items casually; we must not eat too much raw and cold food; and it is best not to eat sweets and the like… In short, everything, everything must pay attention to the two words "cleanliness." After our personal lives are guaranteed, the lives of a family can also be guaranteed, and even the lives of the entire nation of a country can be guaranteed. Children! You are the future masters of the country, life is of the utmost importance, quickly start from today, everyone clean up the filth in your homes, exterminate mosquitoes and flies, not only can you strengthen your bodies, but you can also strengthen the country, and the lives of the masses will also be guaranteed! "After a great war, there must be a great epidemic," let us not forget it!

(Note) All infectious diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever are collectively referred to as epidemics.

### Blind and Deaf Children in Chongqing

— He Gongchao

On the streets of Chongqing, on every commemorative day, there are always teams of propagandists giving speeches and singing to the people, but the most eye-catching is a team of blind and deaf children. They were originally students of the "Nanjing Municipal School for the Blind and Deaf." When Nanjing was about to fall, they, along with tens of thousands of compatriots, walked step by step westward and finally came to Chongqing.

Before the war between China and Japan, there were more than thirty schools for the blind and deaf in the country. Some were founded with personal money, and some were founded by churches. Once the cruel war broke out, they were all closed down, because their school buildings and teaching equipment were all destroyed! Only the Nanjing Municipal School for the Blind and Deaf was able to continue operating in Chongqing. It is now the only remaining school for the blind and deaf in the country—like a lonely star after dawn.

When this school was in Nanjing, it had two hundred students. Under the daily bombing of Japanese planes, classes were still held as usual until that year (end of 1937) when, as the situation became more and more urgent, the government ordered it to suspend classes and retreat westward. However, due to the lack of transportation, most of the faculty and students did not have time to evacuate Nanjing. Only sixty of them arrived safely in Hankou. After the fall of Nanjing, all the school buildings, including the sewing factory, printing factory, photography room, typesetting room, rattanware manufacturing room, as well as many textbooks for reading, writing, and arithmetic, and various teaching tools, were ruthlessly destroyed.

Before the war, graduates could all find jobs. Most of the blind became teachers and musicians, and most of the deaf became clerks in bookstores, companies, and banks. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Administration once allowed the school to allocate 100,000 silver dollars for the construction of a new school building. Ms. Chiang Soong Mei-ling, the chairman of the China Association for the Prevention of Blindness, also promised to select two blind children from this school to study in the United States. However, all these things, my young friends—is the result of China's War of Resistance victory? Failure? Or peace? Please go and see!

(Made by Ni Changmin) (Charity Sale Donation) were all suspended due to the war.

In June 1938, this school moved to Chongqing and resumed classes. It now has more than sixty students, divided into two classes, one for blind children and one for deaf children. The level ranges from elementary school to junior high school and high school. The curriculum includes Chinese, arithmetic, English, music, history, nature, etc. They are now planning to open a vocational class with an attached factory so that students can receive vocational training.

Their Boy Scouts are currently doing various national salvation works: giving speeches, singing, and soliciting donations for national salvation. Last New Year's Eve, this group of blind and deaf speakers and musicians broadcast on the Central Broadcasting Station.

If you see a group of deaf teenagers who cannot speak on the streets of Chongqing, leading their blind companions, walking along, and when they reach a suitable place, the blind teenagers stand up and promote national salvation to the crowd, how moved would you be!

My young friends—is the result of China's War of Resistance victory? Failure? Or peace? Please go and see! (Charity Sale Donation)

### Having a Meal

— Bai Zheng

——Record of Ming'er's Escape – 20——

After spending a night in Yanzhou, when Ming'er woke up from his dream, he realized that it was already dawn. After a while, the sun also emitted strong rays of light high in the sky, but there was no trace of the boatmen on the bow and stern. It was so quiet that nothing was moving. It turned out that they had slept on that big boat last night. Therefore, the Jiangshan boat was still silently resting in the pile of boats, but the refugees in the cabin had already started moving, washing their faces and gargling, doing the work that must be done in the morning. When they had all finished their work, the boatmen came late, and then the boat began to move forward.

In the past few days, you started the boat before dawn, but today, you started so late. Boatman, is it because you slept too comfortably last night? Ming'er asked the boatman, who was standing blankly at the bow and facing his hometown, with a tone of half-blame and half-joking. After Ming'er said this, it reminded him, and he smiled and punted with the bamboo pole. "He is so reluctant to leave his hometown," Ming'er said to himself. At this moment, he heard the sound of breakfast being eaten in the cabin, and he slipped in.

For some reason, Ming'er had a particularly good appetite since he got on the Jiangshan boat. In normal times, he would dislike the three vegetarian dishes, complaining that they were not delicious or refreshing, and he would put down his chopsticks after eating a bowl of rice. But now it was completely different. He could eat almost three bowls in one breath, and sometimes he would add a bite or two. Moreover, the dishes on the boat were not very good, because they had to be prepared by themselves. Ming'er's mother would always ask the boatman if there were any meat or vegetarian dishes for sale in the town. If there were, she would not hesitate to go ashore to buy some, preparing to eat it for two or three days. As a result, each dish had to be kept for two or three days, and the taste was just so-so. But Ming'er didn't dislike the taste at all, and his appetite increased rather than decreased. Not only did he have this phenomenon, but probably everyone in the cabin was like this. Isn't this a strange thing? But it's easy to explain, because in normal times, they mostly used their brains, but now their daily life is either eating and sleeping, or looking at the scenery and chatting, using less brainpower, so of course they eat more than before.

In a narrow corner of the bed, he removed the sheets and put one or two bowls of overnight dishes on the edge of the bed. Ming'er's father took a package and placed it underneath as a stool. The mother sat on the edge of the bed, and Ming'er himself went to fill a bowl of porridge and took a pair of bamboo chopsticks. When he clamped the dish onto the bowl, the porridge soup overflowed from the mouth of the bowl, dripping onto the blanket.

"Why are you so greedy? You can fill it less, and add more after you finish eating, isn't it the same?" his mother said.

"Because I eat very slowly, won't the porridge be filled up by you? Therefore, I have to fill more," these silly words made everyone on the boat laugh. Ming'er said as he walked to the bedding and sat down. His two eyes were fixed on the rice bowl, and he quickly sent the porridge to his mouth with his chopsticks. At this time, he only felt that the sweet and fragrant porridge and delicious dishes were not worth savoring carefully. As soon as the porridge was sent to his mouth, he pushed his tongue to the throat, and the muscles of the throat contracted, and the porridge rolled down. There was a slight burning sensation in his throat, but he didn't feel anything else. He quickly finished a bowl in this gluttonous manner. The sound of "huoluo, huoluo" of eating porridge was probably the loudest in the whole boat. He ate one bowl and then another, and still wanted to add more, but he realized that the bottom of the pot was empty, so he had to put down the bowl and wait quietly for the opportunity to have lunch.

The boatmen carried the boat for about an hour, then retracted the rope and returned to the boat to eat. Ming'er also followed them to the stern. They ate rice in the morning, with only a bowl of green vegetables placed on the deck. Each boatman took a large bowl of rice and swallowed it very refreshingly. Ming'er saw that they were eating so deliciously, and couldn't help but swallow a few mouthfuls of his own saliva. He stopped looking and returned to the bow. Later, Ming'er learned that they had to eat five meals a day, which was not surprising, because they had to walk almost fifty or sixty miles every day.

"Brother, look, they only eat a bowl of vegetables, but they eat a lot of rice, so their bodies are very strong. So, I haven't been eating less these days, my body will probably be like theirs, right?" Ming'er asked his brother, Cong'er, who was reading a book, jokingly.

### An American Child's Travelogue in China

— Xinsheng

In a certain month of a certain year, at the invitation of my Chinese friend Hua'er, I came to travel in China: When the President Steamer (1) sailed away from the Shoal outside the mouth of the Yangtze River, I saw the huge Construction Dredger (2), which is said to be the second largest dredger in the world. When I arrived in Shanghai (3), the buildings such as the International Hotel were somewhat like the scenery of New York City. Most of the aquatic products (4) along the coast are collected and distributed here; From (3), I first went to Hangzhou (5), visited the world-famous West Lake, and then went to Nanjing to visit Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum (6). Then, I took a train north, and sometimes parallel to and sometimes intersecting with the Jinpu Railway (7) is a Grand Canal (8) opened by manpower. The train passed through Shandong Province and reached Tianjin (9). The fruit (10) production in the Shandong Peninsula is extremely abundant. From (9) to Beijing, I visited the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven (11), etc., and then went to see the eleven-hole long stone bridge—Lugou Bridge (12), and paid tribute to the Great Wall (13), which stretches for two thousand miles and winds through the mountains. Then I went out of the customs to the Northeast, where the soybean (14) production is very high, which can be said to be its first source of wealth. The most abundant minerals are coal and iron, and the gold production is also high (15). The forests (16) are also the most lush in China. With the abundance of forests, wild animals breed, so the production of fur (17) is also extremely high here. From the Northeast through Inner Mongolia to Outer Mongolia, the impression that Mongolia gave me was not the bad impression of the Gobi Desert. There are tens of millions of sheep, horses, cattle, and camels (18, 19), grazing in groups in the grassland, which is a great sight! Most of the Mongolians live in Mongolian yurts (20) made of cowhide. They are very skilled in horsemanship, and the art of falconry (21) can arouse my interest! From Mongolia to Ningxia (22), a famous wool-producing area, and then through Yanchang (23), which is buried with huge amounts of oil, into Henan, the train passed through the 3,000-meter-long Yellow River Railway Bridge (24) and reached Hankou (25). The famous Hanyang Iron Works is just opposite Hankou; From (25), I took a boat (26) westward, passing through Dongting Lake (27), which is a large lake in the Lianghu region, which is very rich in rice (28). The boat passed through the Three Gorges (29) and sailed upstream to Chongqing (30), which is China's new capital after the war. From (30), I took a plane (31) to the Northwest, first passing through Lanzhou (32), which is the center point of China's roads, and its famous product is Pisi cigarettes. Then I went to Hami (33), where the melons are very famous, and apples, pears, grapes, etc. are available all year round. In addition, I also saw the Hetian jade (34); Yaks (35) are produced in southern Xinjiang and Qinghai and Tibet. The milk and meat of this cow are used for food, and the dung is used as fuel. It is a very useful domestic animal. Its head looks like a yellow cow, its body is covered with long hair, its tail is like a horse, but its call is like a pig! Tibet also produces a white bear (36), which is very precious. There are also two of them in the New York Zoo! The southern end of the Tibetan Plateau is the roof of the world—the Himalayas (37). The houses on the plateau are flat and square, like碉樓(38); In Qinghai (39), I saw a kind of fish, which has no scales on its body, so it is called scaleless fish. When traveling in Xikang, I once walked across the cable bridge (40) suspended over the rapids. The parrots (41) in Xikang are numerous and fun. The waterwheels (42) in the Chengdu Basin are flat, round and large. This is the application of hydraulic power in the old method. In addition, Sichuan produces a large number of medicinal materials (43). From Chongqing to Guiyang (44) by road, I saw the Miao dance there, which was very beautiful. After arriving in Kunming (45), I rested for a few days. The most famous minerals in Yunnan are copper and tin (46). Later, I returned to Guilin via Guiyang and visited the local mountains and rivers (47). From there, I went to Guangzhou by water. Guangzhou is the birthplace of the Chinese Revolution, a large port in the south. I visited famous buildings such as: Huanghuagang Cemetery of Revolutionary Martyrs, Zhujiang Bridge, and Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall (48), which can accommodate 10,000 people. The products of Guangdong Province include coconuts (49) from Hainan Island, oranges from Shantou, and sugarcane (50), which are all very famous. After I finished my tour, I bid farewell to my friend Hua'er on the coast of the South China Sea, and took a flying boat from Hong Kong and set off across the Pacific Ocean back to my country. The impression I got from this tour is: "China has a vast land, huge treasures, and inexhaustible manpower. If it can use them to build, it will definitely become a very strong country in the future!"

Little friends: After reading this hypothetical travelogue of an American child in China, what are your thoughts?

"You have to know that their strong bodies are mostly due to exercise. If you only eat and don't exercise, your body will grow fat, but the meat on your body is the fat on a pig's body, not muscle. Then you have more fat on your body, are you going to sell it to Lu Gaojian to roast braised pork?" Cong'er replied mischievously, which caused laughter in the cabin again.

### Somersaults

— Ci Kai

Doing somersaults is also a beneficial exercise. You can all try it. However, the somersaults I'm talking about are not asking you to somersault in the air like in a circus, but asking you to somersault in bed or on a soft mat.

The posture of doing somersaults is to bend the body into a spherical shape, so the most important thing when doing somersaults is to bend the body, otherwise it will be easy to fall and hurt. There are two driving forces for doing somersaults, one is in the feet, and the other is in the head. There is one fulcrum, which is in the hands. To put it simply, when doing somersaults, the body is bent, the hands are on the ground as a fulcrum; the head is drilled down, and the feet are kicked down, and a somersault will be successfully done for you.

Doing somersaults is not fooling around, but a very noble and beneficial exercise, but you have to learn slowly. If you practice slowly, if you use too much force and fall dizzy, it will be harmful to you.

In ordinary gymnastics, there are very few that put the head below the heart. The characteristic of somersaults lies here. Many people put their heads below their hearts, and they often blush and feel dizzy, because your head blood vessels are not healthy. If you often do this kind of exercise, the head blood vessels can become healthy.

Whether the head blood vessels are healthy or not is not just empty talk. It is very useful to you in daily life. For example, when taking a ship or train, if you do not have healthy head blood vessels, you will feel dizzy, which is the so-called "seasickness" or "train sickness". If you take a plane, the bumps are even more severe. You will have many opportunities to take ships and planes in the future. If you practice somersaults often now, it will be very beneficial to you.

If you feel dizzy when you somersault lightly, it is due to physical reasons. You can practice step by step, and you will not be dizzy in the future. Dizziness caused by collisions is harmful, and dizziness caused by light somersaults is not important.

Letter from the Editor: Mr. Editor: We are very honored that you published our crude manuscripts. Now we see that there are many manuscripts for charity sales in the newspaper. Although we are elementary school students, we dare not lag behind others in our enthusiasm for saving the country. We are willing to take the two manuscript fees that we have already published in the journal as charity sale donations (1. Black Cat and Flower Cat, 2. The Autobiography of a Swing). We also hope that you will correct our future manuscripts. I wish you a healthy pen. Sincerely, Qi Jinmei and Zhang Zude, students of Zhendong Elementary School, May 4th.

### In the Realm of Beasts (1)

— Xin Qing

Peng Qi was a bad boy. His original name was Peng Qiming, but everyone called him Peng Qi, which was clearly a homophone of Peng Qi. His face was often unclear, as if covered with a layer of clouds, or like a blackboard that had not been wiped clean. Some people said it was because he didn't wash his face thoroughly.

Children are originally good, and there is no such thing as good or bad. Even if they are mischievous, it is common. As long as you are patient until they grow up, they will no longer be mischievous. If a child is smart and clever and not mischievous when he is young, it is naturally like a treasure, which is most pleasing.

Children are naturally fond of collecting, and they also like to destroy, so their small rooms are like a warehouse of bamboo heads, wood scraps, broken copper, scrap iron, and miscellaneous goods. Some things seem completely useless, but sometimes they are very useful. For example, if you want a copper wire or electric wire, or a flower pot is broken, a bird cage is broken, or the handle of some daily necessities is broken, and you want to find something of the same quality to repair it, you only need to go to the children's room to find it, and you can always find it. The things in between are as complicated as a department store, a piece of wax, a building block, or an empty box for watercolor paints, everything is there. Peng Qi's room is of course the same, but there are slight differences.

Also, children's games are varied. In addition to some proper and beneficial games, some are simply close to pranks. In general, boys often kick and beat animals, make fun of smaller children, and ridicule women. They gather a group of like-minded friends and do these tricks together, thinking it is very interesting. Peng Qi is one of them, and he likes to make friends with those low-class bad boys and mess around together all day long. Looking at his own appearance, he is not really low-class. If he were scrubbed with hot water and soap, he would be a young gentleman.

Peng Qi's worst temper is that he likes to abuse animals. He doesn't abuse them unintentionally, nor does he treat it as a game, nor does he vent his anger because he is occasionally unhappy. He really thinks that it is the happiest thing to abuse other things and watch them suffer. It is clear that he was born with this cruel nature, and there is no way to change it.

Peng Qi has two younger sisters, both younger than him. He has always looked down on them. The two of them are a pair of beautiful and gentle little things. Other children like to play with them, especially on school holidays, when they have nothing to do, and having the two of them as companions, they don't feel lonely at all. But Peng Qi only likes to make friends with low-class bad boys, so of course he won't pay attention to his two sisters. He thinks that ball games and all other sports are unconscious. Although his family's garden is well maintained by his two sisters when he is studying at school, he has never moved his hands to plant a flower or a grass. As for reading, writing, and studying natural science, he doesn't care about them at all.

### Motherly Love (2)

— Te Ye

Julian: You should let… let us go, Mom. Mom: You! Li Jiade, you can't go either! Can you imagine what I feel about you in my heart? With parted lips, sleeping next to me, the sound of his breathing lingering in my ears, I know that the happiness of his body and soul belongs to me.

Dad: My love, that was a long time ago...

Mom: No, Li Jiade, everything is right in front of me; just like you, Andrelai, always muttering in your mouth, never at peace, a naughty child, but with a rather clever face, not like you're so old. I walk with you in the garden, putting my hand on your shoulder, as if leaning on you. And you, George, still always climbing trees, do you remember how I always used iodine on your countless scraped skin every night?

Julian: What's the point of talking about these things? Mom, these tasteless..."

Mom: What's the point? You know this is exactly what I can't understand. These tasteless words, I feel are much more important than your fighting. Those trivial things, in my opinion, are worth a whole world. Ever since you had a smattering of knowledge, you have all slipped out of my palms in your speech and expressions. Why? Why? Since ancient times, it has always been the mother who has exhausted her life's blood for you to grow up well.

Grandfather: Don't be angry with them, daughter-in-law.

Mom: I'm not angry with them, father-in-law, I'm angry with this world, it makes me send my children to their deaths one by one, for a bit of lousy glory. Will the world get any better because of this? Is this beneficial? Father-in-law, please tell me.

Grandfather: Of course it's beneficial! The major events of the past are all related to you, and you can't avoid them.

Dad: I know, my dearest, this is making you sad, I'll come see you, I have something to say to you.

Mom: No need to see me, Li Jiade! You don't have to, children don't have to, I can also scare people in times of emergency.

Dad... You, you can too! My love, be generous to die when necessary?

### Finance: Buying Trend Unlikely to Last, Cash Uptrend Weak

Yesterday's cash Shanghai Clearing House (SHCH) dark market situation fluctuated within a commonplace range. However, the market sentiment was firm and rising, as a certain gold shop and a certain silver shop (mostly acting on behalf of the local gang) competed to absorb purchases. In addition, a certain bank also followed suit, resulting in a prosperous situation. The intra-day high reached 2,129 yuan. Afterwards, due to the silver shop gang taking the opportunity to sell at high prices, and money changers continuing to sell, it fell back slightly. However, the result was still a rise of 3 yuan. Transactions were sluggish, with only about 500 taels in the morning. There were no transactions in the afternoon. There were no changes in silver shop gold ornaments. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold also reversed from falling to rising.

SHCH rose by 3 yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened 3 yuan higher due to the double buying trend of a certain gold shop and a certain silver shop (both acting on behalf of the local gang). Then, a certain gold shop entered 50 taels each from peers and silver shop gangs, priced at 2,125 yuan. Soon, a certain silver shop also entered 50 taels from the gold shop at the same price. Following this, it also entered 50 taels from the money exchange industry, priced at 27 yuan. At this time, a certain gold shop also followed suit and entered 50 taels each from the silver shop gang and the money exchange industry, with the same price. In an instant, a certain bank also competed to absorb, so the price was raised by 2 yuan. It is estimated that a certain bank entered 40 taels from the silver shop gang, priced at 29 yuan. Later, a certain silver shop also entered 50 taels from peers at the same price. After this, the buying interest turned weak, and the money exchange industry continued to sell, so the market moved downward, falling by 3 yuan in an instant. The money exchange industry mutually transacted 50 taels, priced at 26 yuan. Later, at noon, the money exchange industry sold another 50 taels to a certain gold shop, priced at 25 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the foreign exchange market being closed on Saturday, people's minds were idle. It was heard that the buyer called 25 yuan, but because the sellers had no intention of supplying, and those who entered did not want expensive prices, there were no transactions for half a day. If calculated at the noon closing price of 2,125 yuan, the result was a rise of 3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing. The selling price of the current cash shop's own brand gold was 2,130 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,120 yuan. The current bid gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but there were no transactions.

Ornamental gold remains at the original price

The selling price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael has not changed. Da Tongxing still maintains the original price of 215 yuan, and Xin Tongxing is 213 yuan, with a purchase price of 207 yuan.

British pure gold rebounds

London telegram on the 12th: British pure gold rebounded by half a penny due to the weakening of the British pound, with each ounce being 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 5 and a half pence. As a result, the Central Bank of China's cash purchase price also rose to 1,211 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold also rose by 2 li, amounting to 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard bid gold price also rose by 3 jiao, amounting to 1,207 yuan and 2 jiao.

### Foreign Exchange Spot Rates Steady, Futures Tightening, Swap Rates Widening Due To This, At 8.5% Monthly Interest

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw strong buying interest from major foreign firms and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) (acting for the Tianjin group), as well as Chinese banks in Guangdong. Foreign banks, including British and American banks, were reluctant to supply spot exchange, while the willingness to supply futures suddenly weakened. This resulted in a situation where spot rates were stable, and futures were soft, causing swap rates to gradually widen. At noon, the swap rate for spot against July delivery was 1.40625 British pounds for the British gold and 3.4375 US dollars for the US dollar, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of approximately 8.6% (this month calculated as half a month). Trading was brisk throughout the morning. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate saw little fluctuation due to balanced supply and demand, and the outcome was unchanged.

In the early morning, London telegraphic transfer rates for both near and far dates contracted by 0.0625. The price of silver in New York remained unchanged.

After opening, major foreign firms competed to absorb spot British gold at 8 pence and 25/100ths from HSBC and Chartered Bank, and then spot US dollars at 16.0625 yuan from American banks. Because supply and demand were balanced, there was little change. When HSBC's listed rates were announced, they were unchanged. After the announcement of the silver equalization tax, which was a small 2.5%, calculated at 5.25%, a Chinese bank in Guangdong bought July delivery British gold from HSBC at 8 pence and 25/100ths. Subsequently, Chinese banks traded June delivery US dollars at 15.9375 yuan. Later, a British bank (acting for the Tianjin group) also bought August delivery British gold at 8 pence and 625/10000ths from foreign banks. Foreign banks then traded August delivery US dollars at 15.71875 yuan. This made the market stable with a slight downward trend. Near noon, there was only Hong Kong dollar trading. Chartered Bank sold spot Hong Kong dollars to money changers at 55.5 yuan. The situation was stable and unchanged. By the afternoon close, the banks' spot selling prices were 8 pence and 25/100ths for the British pound and 16.0625 yuan for the US dollar, similar to the morning opening.

Local Chinese firms have been active recently, with unabated buying. There was no trading in the afternoon. The supply and demand for British and American gold pounds was even. Trading in British and American gold notes was brisk. British gold notes were slightly firmer. Demand for French franc notes increased slightly, and the price rose.

Yesterday's market prices: British gold notes up 1 fen, French franc notes up 2.5 hao, Annam notes down 2 fen. Other currencies were unchanged.

### Premium for Bank Drafts Increases

Recently, the market has seen increased premiums due to high demand for bank drafts. In the past two days, due to the supply-demand ratio, premiums have been increasing, reaching a maximum of 1.5 yuan and a minimum of around 5 jiao. For example, yesterday's premium was 1.25 yuan, meaning it required 1001.25 yuan in banknotes to obtain a 2000 yuan bank draft.

The bulls have been making strenuous efforts to raise prices, but were unable to change the environment. Those with shaky grips started to waver. The opening price was stable. Although Tiansheng, Lianhe, Yongkang, Tongkang, Xingyuan, and No. 49 and other bonds were successively sold, No. 20 showed very strong interest, and No. 35 and No. 41 also bought a considerable amount. The market still didn't break out of the circling situation. The ups and downs were extremely minor. In the afternoon, Xingyuan, Tongkang, Songmao, Renchang, Yongkang, and retail investors all sold, while No. 20 stopped buying. Only Shuntai, Dafeng, and Xieda bought. Lianhe also slightly made up for losses. The supply on the table was already greater than the demand, so it decreased slightly by 2 to 2.5 jiao. As a result, the market price decreased slightly by 2 jiao to 0.5 yuan. The total volume was 670,000 yuan. The concise table is listed below:

| Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unified A | 61.45 | 61.30 | 61.30 | -0.50 |
| Unified B | 54.25 | 54.00 | 54.00 | -0.50 |

### Japanese Debt in England: High Interest, Low Market Price; Credit Inferior to China

London, 12th dispatch, the prices of various Chinese bonds in the London market were the same as the previous day, without any changes, while the prices of Japanese bonds, except for the 6% bonds of 1924, which remained unchanged at 44 pounds, the 5% bonds issued in 1907 fell by 0.75 pounds (that is, 15 shillings), the price was 36.25 pounds (that is, 36 pounds and 5 shillings).

The prices of all bonds are higher than Japanese bonds. The interest rate of Japanese bonds is 6% and 5%, while the interest rate of Chinese bonds is only 4.5% and 5%. The high interest and low price of Japanese bonds show that the credit of Chinese foreign debt is higher than that of Japanese debt. (A)

### Yarn and Cotton: Focus on the "Angel" and "Double Horse" Brands; Odd Lot Yarn Sold at Surprisingly Low Prices; Japanese Yarn Also Stagnant

The yarn market, which had been rising for many days, was sluggish yesterday due to slow real demand. General operators were also less active than before. As for the industry, some had already sold out their large amounts and had no intention of going long for the time being, and had to wait for it to fall back before absorbing again. However, a certain yarn firm was still carrying huge amounts, so their views on whether to go long or short differed. In short, if real sales are strong, the market price will naturally rise; if transactions are clear, the selling will ease. This situation is relatively smooth; otherwise, suddenly raising or suppressing prices will not benefit the reality at all. Observing the market situation, all parties are also waiting for the environment to change before making a decision. However, the price of 20-count yarn from odd lots is too low. The selling price of 20-count "Five Sons" yarn is only 395 yuan, which is about 40 yuan cheaper than the "Double Horse" price. Moreover, this yarn is also an old brand. Why is it so low? It is really because business is not smooth.

At the morning opening of spot yarn, there was no movement in customer sales. Hong Kong brokers were idle, and most predicted that prices would fall back a small step. However, the industry bought 30 bales of 20-count "Double Horse" spot goods at a price of 434 yuan, similar to the previous day's price. The price of warehouse receipts was generously lowered by 2 or 3 yuan. In a short while, the price of spot goods only went to 428 yuan, and the price of warehouse receipts also went to 420 yuan. In the afternoon, because Hong Kong brokers slightly needed fine yarn, the market situation rose. The spot price of 20-count "Double Horse" rose by 3 yuan, to 433 yuan. The price of warehouse receipts also went to 423.5 yuan. As a result, 682 bales were traded in the morning, with sluggish selling prices. 510 bales were traded in the afternoon, with rising market prices. A total of 1192 bales were traded in the two markets, with the price of 20-count "Double Horse" down 5 jiao from the previous day, "Shepherd" down 5 jiao, "Double Globe" down 5 jiao, and the rest were unchanged. However, 32-count "Angel" and "Double Horse" rose by 4 or 5 yuan. The amounts bought by each group are listed on the left: Industry 600, Shantou 3, Fujian 30, Tianjin 20, Hong Kong 245, Yunnan 55, Mainland 17, Xiamen 15, total 1192.

The Japanese yarn market remained sluggish, but the market situation showed a more volatile trend. The price of 20-count "Moon Harp" was 368 yuan on the agricultural side, rising by 2 yuan at noon to a price of 370 yuan, equal to the price of the previous day. A large batch of Indian cotton will arrive tomorrow.

### American Cotton Short Covering, Near-Term Prices Rise Alone; Large Batch of Indian Cotton Arrives Tomorrow

The foreign cotton market prices: the New York cotton market was very sluggish yesterday. At the morning opening, because trading was quiet, market prices fell by 3-5 points. Although the price slightly firmed in the middle due to telegrams from Liverpool and India raising prices, the inventory in the spot market was not thick. Those long on May delivery were expected to receive the most goods. Short sellers desperately covered, so May delivery rose by 11 points alone. Far-term prices all fell by 2-3 points. India was unusually strong. Yesterday, together with the forecast, it rose by 1 rupee again. However, last night, a telegram was received from India that the opening price rose by 2 rupees again. Egypt rose by 3-5 points. Converted to legal currency, the price of American cotton and Brazilian cotton fell by 2 jiao per picul, the price of Indian cotton rose by 4 jiao, and the price of Egyptian cotton rose by 5 jiao.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading: foreign cotton prices have been rising sharply for several days, and the factories have had no trading. However, the industry has been very interested in buying. In recent days, they have already bought more than 10,000 bales of Brazilian cotton. The details were reported earlier. Yesterday, they ordered another 2,000 pieces of Brazilian cotton, to be shipped in July, with a price of 84 yuan for warehouse delivery. Pingguo'er also ordered 1,000 pieces yesterday, with a price of 61 yuan. The converted factory prices for yesterday's cotton market are listed below:

A large amount of Indian cotton will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. The British Company-managed Barom Relhavaea is coming from Karachi with 33,000 bales of cotton, and the Jeypora is also coming from there with 6,010 bales of cotton. Both are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (Monday). The location for berthing is yet to be determined.

The sluggishness of Chinese cotton business is rare in history. There is no market to report and it is completely stagnant. The industry and factories have not traded even one bale. The scarcity of goods and the hoarding of goods by holders have made it difficult for both parties to reach an agreement. However, the converted price of foreign cotton is calm, and all parties are ordering it. The bleak future of Chinese cotton is very worrying. The supply from Northern Jiangsu is also subject to various constraints, and the arrival of goods is meager, only 57 bales.

### Sugar Market: Raw White Rises by 6 Jiao

The World Sugar Production and Sales Conference is being held in London this week. In the previous few days, the consumer side's proposal requested Cuba (the production area) to increase exports by 200,000 tons to supply the free market. This caused speculators to sell off, but now it is heard that this proposal has not been passed, so the London sugar market has suddenly reversed and risen. Yesterday's telegram: August delivery rose by 4.25 pence, to 7 shillings, 5 pence and 35/100ths; December delivery rose by 3.75 pence, to 6 shillings and 5 pence; March delivery next year rose by 3.75 pence, to 6 shillings and 6 pence. This caused the guild's cut-off market situation to suddenly tighten. The spot price of 24 raw white sugar was 27.7 yuan for the local warehouse and 27.5 yuan for the foreign warehouse, up 6 jiao. Transit goods were first 19.4 yuan, trading 1,000 bags, and then rose to 19.6 yuan, trading 200 bags. Taikoo sugar also slightly rose. B mark was first 27.35 yuan, trading 200 bags, and then 27.4 yuan, trading 400 bags. CW was 27.3 yuan, CX 27 yuan, DY 26.8 yuan, HX 26.7 yuan. However, the Hong Kong telegram was unchanged. The domestic sugar market situation also improved, and the Chaozhou group opened more than 100 bags of foot three-tipped white sugar at a price of 25.5 to 25.4 yuan. Yesterday, 115 bags of sugar arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, and another 3,840 bags were shipped from Shantou.

### North and South Goods: Price of Green Bamboo Shoots Tend to Ease

There are still continued arrivals of green bamboo shoots these days, and the market situation is gradually easing. Fatty bamboo shoots are down 3 jiao, to 1.9 yuan. Bald bamboo shoots are down 2 jiao, to 1.8 yuan. Bamboo shoot skins once fell to 75 yuan, but now they have returned to 80 yuan. It is heard that the production price has turned strong, and there is a danger of turning upside down.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Trading Is Brewing

Yesterday, the foreign silk market seemed to be gradually rising from stability. Japanese and American silk prices each showed a firm phenomenon. Yokohama spot prices rose by 18 yuan, and forward prices rose by 31 yuan. New York Japanese silk prices each rose by 2 fen. Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk also rose by 2 fen along with them. The exchange's near-term sold the original plate, and the far-term September rose by 2.5 fen.

In the local silk market, both buyers and sellers are waiting for developments. The current situation is not yet mutually deadlocked. Foreign firms and manufacturers are in contact every day, but because the prices of the two parties differ by as much as 30 yuan, there has been no transaction. Yesterday, Indian and African Zhuangkou were both reported to be sluggish, but silk prices did not tend to fall back, because the current situation is that the inventory of silk and cocoons is limited, silk factories have stopped working night shifts, and the measures for collecting cocoons and transporting new native silk to Shanghai have not yet been resolved. This has delayed the launch of new silk trading, and forward silk prices are also trending upward. 222 pieces of Huzhou silk, 46 pieces of silk waste, and 1,310 boxes of tea were all shipped to Europe the day before yesterday (the 12th).

### Coal: Coke Plummets; Charcoal Can Arrive in Shanghai Today

The coke industry has seen depressed trading recently due to the closure of many foundry operations in the city and the accumulation of inventory. As a result, the market price has plummeted, falling by 30 yuan compared to the previous month. Stockpilers are also selling off in large quantities to avoid further losses. Yesterday, the underground market only opened at 120 yuan per ton, and there were no buyers.

The import of 10,000 baskets of charcoal was reported yesterday. The shipping company said that the ship was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday but will now arrive at 7:00 AM this morning. Therefore, the 10,000 baskets of charcoal mentioned in yesterday's report will arrive today.

### Metals: White Lead Sheet Asking Price Softens

The white lead sheet market had a sense of undersupply, with shortages, but the factories ordered more than 400 drums from overseas, which have now arrived. The long-quiet white lead sheet market has suddenly revived, but selling is slightly down due to abundant supply. No. 2 is selling for 250 yuan per drum, No. 2 for 245 yuan, No. 4 for 245 yuan, No. 5 for 235 yuan, No. 6 for 212 yuan, No. 7 for 100 yuan, No. 8 for 215 yuan, and No. 9 and 10 for 332 yuan, down 1-2 yuan from before. Buyers are from Tianjin, Qingdao, tea merchants, etc. Battery factories in this street are also doing some slight buying.

### Imported and Exported Soda Ash Comes from Tianjin

Yesterday, 700 bags of soda ash were imported from Tianjin, as well as 3,000 cases of fresh eggs, and 250 cases from Northern Sha. The day before yesterday, 79 cases of egg yolk white and 9 cases of sausage casings were shipped to Europe.

### Grains: Underground Rice Prices Emerge Repeatedly; Chang Group Japonica Opens at 16.5 Yuan; Regular Indica Now Filled with Medium-Quality Subordinates

Dumi: Yesterday, all groups' sources were not arriving from He Xia, and only slightly over 1,000 packages of car wheel buns arrived. The source of supply is becoming increasingly scarce. It is heard that this is caused by soaring raw prices in the interior, transportation disruptions, and blockages. The market situation is even more chaotic, with underground prices emerging everywhere, which has become an open secret. It is heard that Chang japonica has opened at 16.5 yuan, Xi japonica has opened at 16.3 yuan, and Su-Tong japonica has opened at 15.7-16.0 yuan. Bo Dao or Si-Jing goods have also opened at 15.7-16.0 yuan, and there are also conservatives who limit Bo japonica. However, most of them are predetermined goods, so this divergence seems to betray the Rice Industry Association's painstaking efforts to limit prices. As for the continued filling of customer-pointed goods with high-quality goods, Ruomi has opened at 13.85 yuan, up 3-4 jiao. Foreign Du-pointed rice has not been seen on the market. The price of Yuan rice is already high, and it is further crowded out by foreign glutinous rice, so it remains at its original plate. Hong Kong glutinous rice opened at 19.8-19.5 yuan. In short, this divergence is that the weight of each good is heavier, which is not scarce, but low-priced goods are also quite numerous. Therefore, indiscriminately setting underground prices seems to be manipulative. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the responsible authorities will value the people's food and take remedial measures, such as unblocking sources.

Customer Indica: Yesterday, it was stimulated by the high underground prices of japonica rice, and the situation became even more tense. The situation in Wuhu's producing area is unclear, and the cargo side is willing to try to recover losses. The source of supply of car wheels has decreased. There are rumors of a 14.4-4.5 yuan underground price for Gao Wuhu indica on the market, and 14.7-4.4 yuan for Jing indica, but none of them can be proven. The officially traded Wuhu indica on the market at 14-13.7 yuan is instead filled with medium-grade goods, Ruomi is also at 13.7 yuan, and rough rice is at 12.6-7 yuan, up 2-3-4 jiao from the previous day. Although there is no confirmation of foreign rice orders, there is a possibility of approaching, so Xigong retail is still only 19 yuan. Foreign Yuan rice continues to be processed, but high-quality foreign Yuan rice also requires 19.8-19.5 yuan. Yesterday, 1,130 bags of rice were imported from Hong Kong.

### Japanese Merchants Continue to Handle Local Wheat; Three Ships of Australian Wheat Arrive Successively; Flour Remains Weak as Before

The flour market remains weak as before. The Beiyang group is still being crowded out by local foreign flour, and the Tianjin flour market is small, making it difficult to transport, so buying is sluggish. The Nanyang group is seeing slightly more active new trading because their stored flour has already been loaded out, but the amount is limited. Each factory, in view of the difficulty in activating customer sales, still maintains its original plate and is unwilling to loosen it quickly. The total trading volume in the unified market is less than 30,000 bags. About half are sold by the local street and inland groups, and the rest are handled by customer groups.

Wheat sources: recently, goods from the Yangtze River inland area have been arriving one after another. At this time when foreign wheat orders are pouring in, factories are sluggish in buying. Only Japanese merchants are buying, and the market is still weak. I, then, at the 1 yuan mark, still have difficulty standing firm. Yesterday, it was heard that Japanese merchants secretly continued to handle a total of about 2,000 packages of wheat from Jiangbei and Changxi, at a price of 6.5-6.45 yuan. It is rumored that the wheat is also transferred to flour factories in North China for flour production. As for the local flour factories' receiving plate, 6.3 yuan is still considered expensive.

A large number of foreign wheat are arriving one after another. The Llandaff, managed by the British-owned Baohe Foreign Company, which was carrying wheat from Australia, was originally scheduled to arrive on the 14th, but according to the company, it arrived ahead of schedule the day before yesterday (the 12th), carrying a total of 8,100 tons of wheat, docking at Qichang warehouse in Pudong to unload. Also, the British Company's Trehata, also carrying 8,076 tons of wheat from Australia, was imported yesterday, temporarily berthed at buoy No. 12, and is scheduled to be transferred to the Huafeng Factory wharf today. Also, the Ridley, managed by Jardine Matheson, is also carrying 8,000 tons of Australian wheat and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 18th of this month.

### Oilseed Cakes; Soybean Oil Planned to Come Again; Once High Price

Yesterday, the soybean oil market continued to rise in the atmosphere of the previous day, because Dalian reported price increases again and again. Those close to Japanese merchants heard that a bullish company was secretly established, intending to create an unprecedented high price of 2.0. Therefore, Dalian oil opened at 38.7 yuan, once reached 39 yuan, and finally closed at 38.8 yuan, trading over 330 barrels. Other Jiaozhou oil opened 100 pieces at 27 yuan, and Lianqi big basket 150 pieces opened at 36 yuan, rising to 36.6 yuan, and Dalian Fengnian oil 70 pieces opened at 37.7 yuan, rising to 38.2 yuan.

It was found that 590 pieces of soybean oil came from Tianjin yesterday, 939 pieces from Qingdao, and 820 cans, and 300 pieces of raw oil came from Tianjin.

### Textiles: Visible Improvement in Spot Sales of White Cloth; Possible New Purchasing by the Wenzhou Group; Domestic Cloth

The market is stable, largely because both cotton yarn and eastern textiles are trending towards a cyclical pattern. Spot sales of white goods are brisk, with the Guangdong group initiating purchases previously, and now the Wenzhou group from eastern Zhejiang is showing a tendency to follow suit. Yesterday, they gathered over a hundred bales of cheap, readily available coarse cloth from Ewo (Jardine Matheson), while another firm, believing that Ewo's wholesale prices were too high and inflexible, has also been continuously buying up 200 bales in the market over the past few days. As a result, the tone for readily available coarse cloth has tightened. The Guangdong group continued to purchase 50-60 bales of fine cloth, fine twill, and drill cloth for local dyeing and small wholesale business in local and other ports, completing transactions for nearly a hundred pieces of Shenxin, Ewo, Dasheng, and miscellaneous drill and fine cloths. Over 5,000 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, striped bleached cloth, poplin, printed cloth, and linen yarn were sold. The Anhui group bought 20-30 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, and drill cloth. The Sichuan-Yunnan group additionally purchased over a hundred cases of colored cloth, colored twill, and printed bleached cloth. The Guangdong group continued to buy over fifty cases of bleached and dyed fine cloth, twill, and poplin. The Tianjin-Yantai group from the north also bought a small quantity, about 40-50 cases, of bleached cloth, poplin, and colored cloth. The day before yesterday, twenty-six pieces of textiles were shipped to Southeast Asia.

Eastern Textiles

Yesterday, the selling prices for fine cloth and fine twill remained firm as before. However, high-end fine cloth, especially the "Color Ball" and "Dragon Head" brands, saw a further price increase of 5 to 10 cents per bolt due to strong demand. Spot goods were priced at $13.95, and next month's futures at $14.05. Northern merchants made some purchases, with transactions totaling approximately 300 bales of various brands of fine cloth. Local demand was moderate, with 500-600 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill being purchased. The prices of colored "Four Gentlemen" broadcloth and tribute satin were affected by sluggish actual sales, and prices have also declined. Spot goods from individual sellers were offered at 44 cents per yard.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Peanut Kernel Prices Firm Up Again

Qingdao Dispatch: Due to renewed purchases by foreign firms, the market for peanut kernels has strengthened. The price of southwest kernels rose 20 cents to $14.80, while the price of east kernels rose to $15, and large kernels to $15.30. Western and Eastern firms, as well as oil mills, purchased 9,000 bags. Peanut prices are stable, with Jardine Matheson buying 2,100 bags at $13. The current stock of Qingdao peanut kernels is over 40,000 bags, and peanuts are over bags. Yesterday, 3,300 bags of peanuts arrived from Weihaiwei, as well as 200 bags of peanut kernels.

### "Import Surplus Figures" Are Shocking

— A Current Trend

Yesterday's local news in this newspaper carried a headline: "Although Trade in Shanghai is Gradually Recovering, Import Surplus Figures Are Shocking," with a sub-headline stating: "While the government is striving to eliminate the import surplus, this is something that all Shanghai residents should feel ashamed about." Indeed, the shocking "import surplus figures" in Shanghai are something that we five million residents of Shanghai, especially the propertied citizens, should feel "ashamed" of!

Shanghai is not only the political and economic center of China (although it has now lost some of its importance, it undoubtedly still has some uses), but also an important international metropolis. People like to describe this young metropolis as "the Paris of the East," which shows just how extravagant and dissolute this sinful place has become! With such an "Oriental Paris" coupled with its "Oriental Destiny," it is no surprise that its "import surplus figures" are rising year by year, and there is nothing to be astonished about!

However, "Oriental Destiny" is not "immutable." The shackles around its neck are suffocating it. Following the angry roar of the suddenly awakened "sleeping lion," this "Oriental Paris" was once thought to be "doomed." People became uneasy about this "Oriental Paris," and although its loyal children were protecting it, some people fled from it.

Like a dream, this "Oriental Paris" soon regained its former glory. People forgot the wounds in their hearts and the uneasiness they had felt towards this "Oriental Paris." Now, that feeling has changed into a joyful cry of "Shanghai is indeed a blessed land!" They forgot that Shanghai is in a rapid and inevitable process of change within the overall "Oriental Destiny," and they seem to have also forgotten that Shanghai is surrounded by terrors that constantly threaten people. Forgotten, all is forgotten. In Shanghai, following the rapid changes in "Oriental Destiny," they still have the heart to display a "Parisian attitude." As a result, the import surplus for the first quarter of this year was 47,578,000 yuan, an increase of 28,471,000 yuan compared to 19,100,700 yuan in the same quarter last year. Because the customs have changed hands, it is self-evident what kind of goods account for the majority of imports!

Is this not something for the people of Shanghai to be "ashamed" of? However, this "shame" should still be borne by the propertied class, because for the poor people in Shanghai, the problem of just "living" is already enough to make them sigh a hundred times a day. What energy do they have left to buy the "goods" they want but cannot afford? Therefore, the problem still requires wealthy friends to be more "frugal"! If you ask "why?", then the answer is very simple: "Saving the country is also saving yourself and your descendants!" (Auction for Charity)

### Clear Skies After the Rain

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 10: A Respectable Mother with a Bun and a Blue Skirt; A Vigorous Old Man with Silver Beard and Green Sleeves

Let's talk about Village Chief Zhu of Freedom Village. He established many remedial schools to teach people to catch up on their studies. It didn't matter if they were male or female, or even if they were older. Especially in winter, because farmers had a little more free time then. Freedom Village also built an assembly hall, which served several purposes. Any village meetings or gatherings of villagers would naturally be held in this hall. For example, if a celebrity came, Village Chief Zhu would invite them to give a lecture in the hall. Furthermore, any public celebrations or commemorative events would often be held in the assembly hall as well. The Freedom Village Elementary School was right next door to the assembly hall. With such a new village and with the advocacy of someone as well-known as Zhu Laoyuan, it was not difficult for Freedom Village to flourish. But Village Chief Zhu was a simple man. Other towns were becoming increasingly prosperous, with all kinds of entertainment. Freedom Village didn't even have a movie theater. If a traveling troupe or film education group rarely came, they would mostly perform in the assembly hall. There was a park, and it was quite large, but there were very few buildings in the park. There were wide expanses of grass and a planting area so that children could learn about various plants. Village Chief Zhu's own residence was not far from the elementary school, just three bungalows, completely in the style of a rural cottage. In front of the door was an open space, surrounded by a woven bamboo fence, with two low doors. Just inside the entrance was a grape trellis, to provide shade in the summer. Village Chief Zhu would move a bamboo couch under the grape trellis in the cool evenings of summer, bare his feet, open his chest, and sit with his legs apart, enjoying the cool air. Or he would invite a few old friends to talk about the past and the present. He had no other hobbies, except that he occasionally liked to drink three cups of wine when he was in the mood. The wine was not expensive, and he didn't need any foreign brandy or whiskey, or even any famous Chinese wine. He only drank homemade "Du brew," which his daughter-in-law, the Madam, could make herself. She often made it as a filial offering to her father-in-law, for him to enjoy whenever he needed it. Behind his cottage, there was also an open space. Facing his cottage, a three-room, one-story building had been built, but it was not elaborately constructed. Now, Madame Zhu, Zhu Airen's mother, lived there. Village Chief Zhu felt that he did not need to live in such a building, and he was not used to living in one either. This house was prepared for his granddaughter to live in. He thought that his granddaughter had returned from abroad, and foreigners liked to live in one-story buildings, so he provided the house for his granddaughter to live in. (109)

### The Meat Market

— Buddha

The words "advantage" and "disadvantage" are relative. From one point of view, something may be considered harmful, but from another point of view, it may be considered beneficial. Such situations are too numerous to mention.

After the problems in the pork market, those who used to feast when passing the butcher's shop could no longer do so, and could not help but drool with regret. But normally, Shanghai consumed 5,000 to 6,000 pigs a day. After the war, this was reduced by half, and recently, it was only 20 to 30 a day. Therefore, from today onwards, the slaughterhouses in both concessions have stopped slaughtering pigs. From the pigs' point of view, they should be shedding tears of gratitude.

### The Sorrows of a Virgin

— Li Zhihua

Yes, My darling danghcgr

A Warner Bros. Production, Showing at the Cathay Grand Theatre

"The Sorrows of a Virgin" is a comedy worth watching, but the advertising friends have distorted it. This distortion, whether intentional for the sake of "business sense" or due to the subconscious revelations triggered by the translated title, will weaken the value of the film itself.

The director, William Keighley, is a familiar figure to us. Didn't his "Valley of the Giants" and "Robin Hood" give us good impressions? Not long ago, he borrowed his wife, Genevieve Tobin (who plays Connie in the film), to visit Shanghai, and the Shanghai office of Warner Bros. even held a tea party for him at the International Hotel.

However, most of his past works belonged to the so-called "hard" films. A light comedy like "The Sorrows of a Virgin" is rare. Talent knows no bounds! William's handling of this film is no less successful than his previous so-called "hard films": witty and humorous, lively but not boisterous.

The story of "The Sorrows of a Virgin" is very simple: A wealthy magazine editor, responding to the advice of a friend, goes to the countryside for a weekend trip to breathe some fresh air, but as a result, he does not get a quiet rest. His friend's daughter has a small misunderstanding with a young architecture student and poet (because the poet is too poor to attend her graduation ceremony). When the misunderstanding is cleared up, the young man, for the sake of his independence, has to leave her for two years until he succeeds. For this reason, she decides to return to the small villa in the countryside with him for a two-day gathering, but her actions are interfered with. Through her efforts and the help of her grandmother, she finally gets her wish. In the end, the family, because of their resolute and bright love, fulfills their good intentions.

The story is naturally American, too far away from our current bloody China. However, in our semi-feudal society, the next generation's struggle for their freedom of love - the autonomous search for the partner who will sustain their lifelong happiness - has its value in terms of anti-feudalism. "When you were my age, would you have wanted to be interfered with?" (something to that effect). Eileen's fingerprints silenced her novelist mother.

Children should have their own freedom - that is to say, children should not be the private property of their parents.

The director's technique is very superb. Such dialogue-heavy material is handled with such lightness and vitality, and the comedic atmosphere is very strong, which is not an easy task. The success of this is due to several factors: one is that the characters of each role are written as living people; another is the clear and concise editing; and even more so is the complete matching of the actors. In this play, it is simply difficult to distinguish who is the protagonist. And because of this, the play is successful.

If a play must have a protagonist, then, in my opinion, the protagonist of this play should be May Robson, who plays the old grandmother Granny, and not Priscilla Lane, who plays Eileen. Priscilla Lane naturally plays well, especially in the opening scene where she argues with Douglas, which shows that she can play a modern American woman, agile and healthy and not a lipstick-filled character. Compared with O'Sullivan and others, she is younger and more lovely. What about the other roles? I don't want to list them all. I just want to tell you one sentence is enough: it is difficult to say who is the protagonist and who is the supporting role in this play.

### (1) The Transformation of Material Life

— Yu

Materialists always insist on the omnipotence of matter, denying all forces outside of matter. But when he encounters great suffering, or when he feels that non-material forces can supplement it, he may realize the need for a super-material comfort. This super-material thing is the spirit of mankind.

Today, our country is facing a rare crisis. The survival, honor, and disgrace are all tied to the spirit of the Chinese people, and not entirely to the strength of the military. We must rise up together, correct the life of drunkenness and self-abandonment, and exert the greatest and most upright spiritual power to complete our mission of inheriting the past and opening up the future.

Dear compatriots, especially those of us living in Shanghai, have we ever reflected on our current life? Are we able to pay attention to material enjoyment and neglect the fulfillment of purity? Are we still indulging in the decadent life of wine, women, tobacco, and gambling, and forgetting the great responsibilities to the country and the nation? If so, we should immediately transform our lives and make them more serious, so as to avoid a decadent will and scattered spirit, which will affect the future of individuals and the country.

However, we firmly believe that to transform our lives, we still need help in morality and faith. Jesus Christ is our good friend, Taoist priest, and savior. He will guide us, cleanse our sins, and give us the power to transform our lives. He is the only savior of mankind. Those who believe in him will not perish, but have eternal life.

### Chaplin Receives Numerous Threatening Letters for Filming New Film "The Dictator"

— (Shu Mang)

Special Guards Hired to Protect Him in Shifts, Determined Not to Waver from His Original Intention and Strive to Proceed

The new talkie "The Dictator" by silver screen comedy master Charlie Chaplin, as everyone knows, satirizes a certain dictator. It emphasizes the stupidity and ridiculousness of certain barbaric and unreasonable political phenomena in the current world situation and brings them to the screen in the form of comedy, giving them a merciless blow in front of audiences around the world. This will of course make certain people who are being satirized feel angry and threatened, and therefore they have resorted to their usual rogue means - intimidation - assassination against Chaplin.

"The Dictator" has already started filming and is currently in active production. However, since the decision to start filming this film, Chaplin has received countless threatening letters, mostly saying that "The Dictator" contains "disparaging" meaning, forcing him to immediately stop filming, otherwise they will use terrorist means to put Mr. Zhu "to death," etc. In order to prevent being poisoned, Chaplin has recently hired a personal armed guard to protect him around the clock. During the preparation of his three meals a day, special detectives are assigned to supervise the cooking to prevent villains from poisoning him. At the same time, during the filming of the film, the surrounding area of the studio is also guarded, and the situation is quite serious. However, it is said that although Chaplin has been threatened by the intimidation of thugs, his original intention has not wavered in the slightest; on the contrary, the production of "The Dictator" is currently being actively accelerated, day and night, in order to present "this ridiculous comedy to enlightened people all over the world in the shortest possible time." According to Hollywood filmmakers being so heavily guarded, as if they were important political figures, is still a pioneering achievement in film history.

An Unofficial History of the Theatre World

### New Theater Group to Rehearse "The True Story of Ah Q"

The Shanghai theatre scene seems rather cold and lonely. Apart from occasional performances by school theatre groups, the Shanghai Theatre Arts Society is only performing early morning shows on Sundays at the New Guangda Theatre. Large-scale performances have not been seen on the spring theatre scene.

In reality, the Shanghai theatre scene is flowing with an exciting "low tide," and the "low tide" may be just around the corner and once again stir up a "high tide."

This "high tide" also confirms what I am about to report, that Xu Bufu and others, formerly of the Qingdao Theatre Society, have newly organized a New Theater Group. The members include Zhang Wan, Cai Jin, Shen Ling, and others.

Although this is a newly formed theatre group, and very little news has been revealed outside, in reality they are working hard behind closed doors, rehearsing Mr. Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q" at their group's location on Route Foch these days. This, you can imagine, is such a great plan.

"Ah Q" has not been performed in Shanghai before. "China Travel" wanted to perform it before, but the result was destroyed by the artillery fire. Now the New Theater Group is performing "The True Story of Ah Q" as their first shot, and I have to admire their boldness.

The role of "Ah Q" is played by Shen Ling, who is a student at the Sino-French Drama School. Guess who is responsible for directing the whole play? It is the traveler who wrote tens of thousands of words on "The Low Tide of the Shanghai Theatre World" in the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao. (Also known as Xiao ). I haven't seen this gentleman's plays before. We hope that he can overcome all difficulties and bring "Ah Q" to meet us soon.

### Skating Technique (12) Starting Steps

— Compiled by Lian Junqi and Zhen

Starting Steps

No matter what pattern you are skating, you must be stable and not jittery. You must stand still before starting. You should use a lot of force when starting, so that one foot can form an eight-character shape in one breath without interruption. When skating any pattern, of course, do not exhaust your strength. You must save enough strength to maintain your speed.

During competitions or exams, you must not borrow force from the main foot when starting. You must rely entirely on the push of the auxiliary foot. Use the entire edge of the shoe to push, not just the toe. After pushing, the auxiliary foot remains behind, with the toe pointing downward and outward, and the leg angled outward from the hip. If the auxiliary foot is not smooth and even when pushing, it will definitely be unsightly. A common mistake is that the knee is too close to the main knee, and the toes are drooping or too far outward.

Starting Acceleration Method

(1) Lean your body in the direction of movement. For example, if you are moving to the right, lean to the right. If you are moving to the left, lean to the left. And keep the center of gravity of your body and mind within the circle you want to draw. (This method is more effective when drawing a circle than when starting.)

(2) Before the main foot touches the ground, it should swing down like a sickle or hammer.

(3) Let any arm hang down and swing down like a clock pendulum. Avoid lifting the arm horizontally.

(4) The foot standing on the ground should straighten the knee and push off the ground with the foot at the same time.

The above four methods can be used at the same time or separately. If you use them at the same time, you can avoid fatigue.

Four-Sided Starting Method

Before starting, you must first place a straight line in the rink (called the vertical axis), fix your eyes on the position, and then start. The size of the country should be equal, and the beginning and end should be level. Do not start large and then small, or curved and skewed.

(1) Outward Progress Starting Method

Bring your heels close together. The left foot should form a 45-degree angle with the vertical axis. Lift your right foot and move it to the back, then move your right foot straight into the arc. The center of gravity should be within the circle you want to draw. Swing any arm forward, but do not move both arms forward at the same time. At the same time, lean your body forward and move your left foot forward. Bend your left knee first and then straighten it. When moving outward, keep your auxiliary leg and shoulder behind you for as long as possible. The longer you keep them behind, the better it looks. When moving forward, the auxiliary shoulder should be ahead of the auxiliary leg. The auxiliary leg must be straightened when moving forward, and the knee can be slightly lubricated after moving forward.

(2) Right Inward Progress Starting Method

All methods are the same as the right outward progress, but the left foot should form a 30-degree angle with the vertical axis. When moving inward, keep the auxiliary leg behind you for as long as possible, and extend it outside the circle you are drawing. Move your auxiliary shoulder forward early so that your action faces the direction of movement without leaning to the side.

It is easier to use the standing starting method for inward and outward progress. Stand upright, keep your feet close together, and the main foot and auxiliary foot should form a T shape. Bend your main knee when starting. Do not bend your waist. Keep your auxiliary foot on the ground for as long as possible. After moving, straighten your auxiliary toe outward, straighten your main knee, and do not move your auxiliary leg close to your main leg. (A common problem for beginners is that they clamp their thighs together and do not straighten their auxiliary leg from the hip, but bend it at the knee.)

(3) Outward Retreat Starting Method

Face the circle you want to draw, and keep your left foot parallel to the vertical axis. Lift your right foot and place it in front of your left foot, swinging to the left of your left foot. Your center of gravity is on your left foot. At the same time, (A) lean your body to the right, (B) move your right foot from left to right in front of your left foot, and (C) swing your right arm to the right. You can also use your left arm, but do not use both arms at the same time.

(4) Right Inward Retreat Starting Method

Face the vertical axis, with your back to the circle you want to draw. Keep your left foot parallel to the vertical axis, and your center of gravity on your left foot. Swing your right foot past in front of your left foot, and the rest is the same as the right outward retreat starting method.

Note - The toe of the supporting foot (i.e., the right toe) should be pointing inward, and the left foot must leave the ground immediately. The left leg should move from inside the circle to outside the circle. This is like the rudder of a ship, which can turn the whole body.

### Silver Screen News

— Qin Tian

Yi Hua Manager Yan You will direct "A Trip to Mars," which will be a completely scientific film.

Yu Lin only has one dimple on the left side of her face. Unexpectedly, after Hu Die, there is another person like this. There will truly be a future after the future.

Li Pingqian's "The World of Gold and Silver" is adapted from the famous French writer Molière's "The Miser," which was once put on stage and became very popular.

Wang Yin's "Desperate Fugitive" has already started filming. The leading actors are Yuan Meiyun and himself. This is a completely hard film.

Wang Cilong is currently buried in writing a detective script.

Bu Wancang's direction of "Mulan Joins the Army" has produced unexpected results. The story of the film is introduced below:

Lawyer Wang Zhenzhong's wife, Lin Yuhua, demands that her former lover, Liang Ziqing, return the love letters she gave him in the past, but Ziqing refuses. At this moment, the woman who was deceived by Ziqing, Suqiu, suddenly bursts in. Yuhua hurriedly hides behind. In that instant, Ziqing is assassinated by Suqiu, and Suqiu commits suicide out of fear of being punished for her crime. Yuhua panics and escapes through the window.

The detective arrives after hearing the news. From Suqiu's intermittent confession, he learns that it is a love affair murder case, and these words happen to fall into the ears of Zhenzhong, who has come to look for his wife. He picks up a handkerchief with bottom on a sofa. He goes home and immediately forces her to leave the family.

Yuhua roams outside and sees an advertisement in the newspaper for lawyer Wang Zhenzhong seeking a good doctor, which makes her even more sad. She repeatedly returns home, but receives a stern reprimand. Disappointed, Yuhua returns to the hotel. The horror of life leads her into the arms of special figures Hu Da and A Long. She becomes a little sheep, working as a dancer, a prostitute, and gradually degenerating into the lowest prostitute. Hu Da and A Long's father think that she has lost her beauty and have another evil plan, and the target is precisely lawyer Wang Zhenzhong.

Zhenzhong's daughter, Jianying, returns to China after completing her studies overseas and inherits her father's profession. During the trial of Yuhua's murder case, the court appoints Jianying as her defense lawyer. Yuhua, while looking at Jianying, cannot help but reveal relief from her pain. When requesting Jianying to temporarily act as her daughter and call her mother a few times, Yuhua passes away with a smile.

### A Glimpse of Shanghai Stars in Hong Kong (II)

— Sketch Artist: Zheng Zhihang　Writer: Zheng Youxuan

Li Li of Beiping

Ever since the labels of "suspect" and "female spy" were placed on Li Li of Beiping by Dao Wei-jia, she immediately became a "problematic figure." All newspapers, unintentionally, did a lot of free publicity for her. Although the name "Li Li of Beiping" was well-known in the north before, it was very unfamiliar in the south. But now it's different! When she was acquitted and flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong, the people of Hong Kong almost treated her like an important person, welcoming her and interviewing her! She also made speeches and received celebrities as if it were a big deal. Smart film producers saw this focal point and tried every possible means to win her over. As a result, they paid her four thousand yuan to make a Mandarin film called "An Extraordinary Beauty." But when this film premiered, she suddenly disappeared! The publicity tactics were quite clever.

### Anecdotes from the Peking Opera World

— Xu Muyun

Da Liwu's Love of Practical Jokes

Da Liwu, Li Yuanting, was not only foul-mouthed, but also loved to play pranks, especially on others. Once, Yu Yuqin's grandfather was the victim of his tricks, which went badly for him. Yu's nickname was "Big Beast," and he and the famous clown Gan San both had a fondness for riding donkeys. Whenever he went to a restaurant to perform, he used the donkey as transportation. When he arrived backstage, he would always tie the donkey in the backstage courtyard. Unexpectedly, one day Da Liwu suddenly felt mischievous. While the donkey's owner was performing on stage, he sneaked into the courtyard, led the donkey to a secluded spot, and used paintbrushes and paint to personally paint the donkey's face. The facial makeup painted on the donkey's face was exactly the same as the facial makeup Yu Boss wore that day on stage. After he finished painting, he led the donkey to a crowded place. Everyone looked at it and burst into laughter. Instantly, the backstage area was filled with noise, and everyone shouted in unison, "This is the real Big Beast!" Yu Boss, nicknamed "Big Beast," was performing on stage at that moment. He suddenly heard laughter and commotion from backstage, and everyone was shouting his nickname. He had no idea what was going on and couldn't help but panic. He forgot his lines and didn't know where to put his hands and feet. So, inexplicably, he made several mistakes. He barely finished the performance (luckily, it was the last scene). He rushed backstage and saw the scene. He was both angry and amused. He wanted to grab Liwu and fight him, but he had already disappeared. Helpless, he endured the pain and removed his makeup and washed his face. After washing his own face, he had to wash the donkey's face. Unexpectedly, Liwu was even more mischievous. Before painting the donkey's face, he applied a lot of glue to the donkey's face. In addition, the donkey's face had hair, which was different from a human face, so the paint was difficult to wash off temporarily. Yu Boss frantically worked for a long time, using several buckets of cold and hot water, causing the donkey to scream loudly from the heat. In the end, he still couldn't wash it off. Seeing that it was getting dark and the people backstage were going home for dinner, he angrily rode the donkey with the painted face back home. Everyone who saw him on the way pointed and talked, thinking it was a strange thing. (End)

### Providing Relief to Korean Refugees

A British merchant ship was navigating in the sea 600 miles southeast of Chengshantou in Dong Province when it encountered seven Korean nationals who had fallen into the water after their boat capsized. They were rescued immediately by a sampan and taken to the Donghai Customs according to their names. After Supervisor Gong Yitu and others questioned them one by one, they were all unfamiliar with Chinese language and writing. One of them presented a small wooden plaque, one side engraved with the characters "Xianchang Gao Wenzong Dingchou Born," and the other side engraved with the characters "Lingyan Qiuzishi." Another presented an iron fishing hook. They all had their hair in a bun and wore large white silk clothes, undoubtedly from a Korean fishing boat that encountered a storm at sea. Supervisor Gong and others sent a letter to the British Consul to commend the merchant ship and reported the situation to the court, requesting the court to provide relief.

### Admonition against Smoking Opium

Originally, there was no intention to smoke opium,
Friends spent all the money together;
Who knew it would really become addictive,
Turning rich and poor over to fate.
Once, I enjoyed prostitution, gambling, and drinking,
I couldn't stop getting used to smoking white smoke;
Later, I gave up prostitution and gambling,
But my face turned dark when I craved opium.
From then on, I smoked opium at home,
Sleeping until the sun was high in the sky;
Smoking made my face thin and gaunt,
Carrying things with just two shoulders.
The house was sold, the paper notice red,
The broker busy as usual;
Selling mutton was not as good as selling dog meat,
The front hall and back yard given to the opium den.
The rent was in arrears, the bills unpaid,
It was hard to borrow opium from the foreign firm;
My prostitute wife was abducted and went with someone else,
Leaving only a rusty knife in the kitchen.
I advise you not to smoke opium again,
Quickly quit and get through these years;
I have been through this bitter sea,
These are not harsh words at all.
