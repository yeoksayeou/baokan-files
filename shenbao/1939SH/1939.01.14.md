### China Makes Great Progress in Military Reorganization; Initiates Plan to Strengthen Self-Sufficiency in Military Equipment

(Hong Kong) China's military reorganization and build-up efforts are making steady progress. The current military strength exceeds the pre-war level by 口口 ten thousand. Management is also moving towards unification. Military supplies, ordnance, training, and organization are all gradually being standardized. (Special dispatch, 6:30 PM, 13th)

According to a Chinese newspaper report from Hong Kong, due to the outbreak of the war of resistance and the gradual expansion of the war zone, the Chinese military authorities have mobilized over a million soldiers. As the strategic focus shifts to long-term resistance, the consumption of military materials and equipment has become enormous. Relying solely on external supplies presents numerous obstacles. Therefore, the military and political authorities recently dispatched General Yu Dawei, director of the Ordnance Bureau of the Ministry of War, to Yunnan Province to investigate the province's production and transportation of military materials and equipment and to implement a plan to strengthen self-sufficiency.

### Sichuan Generals Resolve to Uphold the National Policy of Resistance; Chongqing Headquarters to be Dissolved by the End of the Month

(Chongqing) According to Chinese military sources speaking to the Associated Press, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly met with Deng Xihou, Director of the Sichuan Pacification Headquarters, Deputy Director Pan Wenhua, and Provincial Chairman Wang 　Xu. They all expressed their determination to Generalissimo Chiang to continue upholding the national policy of resistance. Wang Xuxu also stated that the provincial government's administrative affairs would absolutely comply with the orders of the central government. It is reported that the central government is currently undertaking a grand plan to transform Sichuan and Xikang into two model provinces in western China and "bases for resistance and reconstruction." The central government is now diligently engaged in material construction. The plans drafted by the Executive Yuan are as follows: Adjust rural administration in the two provinces; Develop highway and waterway transportation; Revitalize the rural economy; Encourage industry and commerce; Exploit mineral resources; Organize and train the population; Popularize education and raise the cultural level of the population; Readjust the monetary situation. (Associated Press dispatch, 13th)

(Chongqing) Today, Chinese military authorities told the Associated Press that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters would move from Chongqing to Chengdu. It is claimed that there was indeed such a plan two weeks ago, but it was later abandoned because it was deemed unnecessary. The Chongqing headquarters may be dissolved by the end of the month. Currently, preparations for its closure are underway. According to the original plan, it was intended to reorganize the military structure of Sichuan Province to facilitate resistance. However, since the military and administrative heads of Sichuan Province are currently in Chongqing, and all matters are being handled in accordance with the will of the central government, it is not necessary to implement the plan. Generalissimo Chiang felt that with the Military Affairs Commission now located in Chongqing, this was unnecessary. However, Generalissimo Chiang will establish offices in Chengdu and Kangding, each with several secretaries, which is completely different from the organization of the headquarters.

Editorial

### Rapidly Expand the Air Force

Although China's air force has only a short history of a few years, it has fully demonstrated its power in the War of Resistance: not only bombing Japanese positions and achieving great success, but also making the heroic move of demonstrating abroad. Recently, taking advantage of the stubborn resistance of the Japanese invading Guangdong, it has been active everywhere, sinking two Japanese warships in the lower reaches of the Pearl River. The reason why the Chinese air force can make such great achievements and gloriously fulfill its responsibility to defend the country must be attributed to the efforts of the National Government and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in promoting it and the enthusiastic support of the entire nation.

The Japanese army's invasion of China not only uses the air force as an auxiliary force, but even uses it to solve some important strategic problems. It often launches large-scale operations to attack any location in China. Recently, as China's War of Resistance has entered its second stage and a full-scale war has broken out, the Japanese army has been contained in all directions and is at a loss. Therefore, it has dispatched a large number of air forces to bomb undefended areas in China, killing a large number of civilians, in an attempt to break the Chinese people's will to resist. However, this kind of intimidation has not only had no effect, but has made the Chinese people's understanding clearer and their will to resist stronger; at the same time, it has further angered the air force warriors of friendly countries, who, unable to sit idly by and watch this inhumane attack, have all voluntarily come to China to join the air force and fight against Japan. It is recently reported that 500 foreign pilots have secretly arrived in China to participate in the war. This is worthy of our attention.

The air force is an offensive force. As China's War of Resistance has entered its second stage, the strategy has changed from passive to active, and a full-scale counteroffensive is about to be launched. In order to strike at the Japanese army's rear, disrupt Japanese communications and transportation, weaken the Japanese army's strength, increase the Japanese army's difficulties, and even use it to solve some important strategic problems, it is very important to strengthen the air force. Therefore, China is now actively expanding its air force organization and strengthening its air force strength. In addition to having ordered 200 bombers from the American White Land Gray aircraft company, it has also decided to accept the request of foreign pilots to join the air force to fight against Japan, and a new air force will be formed and put into combat in the near future. This kind of positive measure is also very worthy of attention.

However, since the air force is the main offensive force, the consumption rate of aircraft and air force personnel must be very high. In order to seek the final victory of the War of Resistance, it is necessary to maintain the superiority of the air force. In order to maintain the superiority of the air force, it is necessary to be able to replenish it quickly at any time. In order to achieve this goal, we put forward the following two suggestions:

First, the superior aircraft replenishment capacity depends on industrial and mechanical efficiency. China's backward military industry is an undeniable fact. At present, the supply of aircraft cannot but depend on foreign countries, which is the most difficult thing during the War of Resistance. Therefore, at present, it is necessary to develop the military national defense industry as much as possible, and should have the determination to expand the aircraft manufacturing industry and implement practical and feasible manufacturing plans. At the same time, it should also try to develop factories for manufacturing parts and repairs, so that it can quickly repair damage before it can mass-produce aircraft. Its decision is that, because the aircraft cannot but depend on foreign countries at present, a large amount of funds is needed to purchase from foreign countries, so the Chinese people should continue and expand the donation movement to purchase aircraft. The spirit of purchasing aircraft to celebrate birthdays is used to launch the movement to purchase aircraft to celebrate victories.

Second, the replenishment of excellent air force personnel depends on active training. In China, where technology is relatively backward, it is still necessary to hire foreign experts with rich knowledge and experience to be responsible for training, but soldiers trained in the War of Resistance should also be regarded as coaching cadres. At the same time, it is best to send a large number of young people to countries with excellent aviation technology for further study in order to improve the training of Chinese air force personnel. It is also necessary to increase the number of aviation schools in China and cultivate a large number of aviation personnel with a firm determination to resist and sacrifice.

Although the Chinese air force has already made great contributions in the past, its future tasks are even greater. In order to complete this greater task, the Chinese government must quickly expand and strengthen it.

### China Orders 200 Military Aircraft from American Factory, German Newspaper Reports China Purchasing Czech Armament Factory, US Secretary of State Receives Japanese Ambassador Horiuchi

(Washington) China has ordered 200 new-style bombers worth $8,500,000 from the American Belanca Aircraft Company. The purchase contract was signed yesterday by Dr. Xu Shilian, consultant to the Chinese Embassy. It is said that the transaction will be completed within nine months. Upon receiving the contract and the Chinese check, the American side should ship the first batch of ten aircraft to China within 60 days, and then continue to ship at least 25 or more than 50 aircraft per month. Because the Chinese side ordered as many as 200 aircraft at one time, Belanca Company offered a particularly low price. If China cannot accept all of them in the future, the price of each aircraft will be increased accordingly. The characteristics of this new bomber are that it is equipped with 7.92 mm machine guns that fire simultaneously with the propeller, located on both sides of the fuselage. Each wing also has two 7.92 mm cannons. Behind the pilot's seat, there is also a 7.92 mm "adaptive cannon." Each bomber is equipped with a machine that can hold four 300-pound bombs and three 100-pound demolition bombs. According to the records of the Department of Munitions, this is the largest military purchase made by a Far Eastern country from the United States, almost equal to the $9,000,000 aircraft transaction that Japan made with the United States in early 1938. At a time when the American aviation and aircraft industry is "voluntarily" embargoing military supplies to Japan, and with the recent rumors of peace from the Chinese side, China's sudden purchase of a large number of aircraft is generally considered to be of great importance. According to sources in the Department of Munitions, the State Department sent a letter to all American aircraft manufacturers in July last year, strongly urging them to ban the sale of aircraft to countries that bomb civilians. It is said that most businessmen have complied with this proposal of the State Department, and since July 1, 1938, no military supplies have been shipped to Japan. (American Associated Press dispatch, 13th)

(Washington) It is said that this is a cash transaction, and China will pay in silver, which has nothing to do with the recent $25,000,000 loan to China from the US Export-Import Bank. The Chinese Ambassador issued an explanation of the Belanca contract today, saying that the Chinese side has the right to choose regarding delivery, and the official statement is that although this right of choice has not been fully implemented, the procedures for transporting the aircraft have been completed. (American Associated Press dispatch, 13th)

(New York) The news that the Chinese government has ordered 200 bombers from the American Berlanga Aircraft Factory has just been confirmed by the factory's consultant, Grupe. It is said that the two sides began negotiations as early as August 9 last year. The proposals put forward by the factory have been accepted by the representatives of the Chinese government and should be approved by the US government. The two sides are still in negotiations and have not formally signed a contract. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

(London) Reuters diplomatic correspondent claims that Japan is not paying official attention to news reports that Britain is preparing to take active steps to safeguard its trade in China and the open-door policy, and will wait for more concrete information on the matter. As for the rumors that Japan plans to ban the circulation of all banknotes in North China except for those issued by the Joint Reserve Bank of China in March, Japanese sources in London have not been able to confirm this. However, some Japanese opinions do advocate that it is not appropriate to attempt to clarify the Chinese currency issue while the war is going on. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

(Washington) After returning from the capital of Peru yesterday, Secretary of State Hull received Japanese Ambassador Horiuchi for the first time today and held talks with him. Afterwards, he told reporters that Ambassador Horiuchi did not present any notes, and today's talks were of a general nature. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

(Berlin) The Berlin Daily News' correspondent in Prague telegraphed that the Chinese government is very interested in the sale of the Czech armament factory in the Bílina region. After news of the Czech government's intention to sell most of its shares in the factory spread, a Chinese delegation went to Prague and was said to have been ordered to negotiate and had the financial resources to buy the Czech government's shares. The funds required were deposited in an American banking group. The purpose of buying the shares was to increase China's strength in resisting Japan, and the only condition for the purchase was that the factory immediately began supplying China with military supplies. However, the Czech government has rejected this proposal. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### Zhu Jia-hua and Wang Shi-jie Send Telegram to Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Urging Amendment of the Current Neutrality Act and Hoping to Stop the Supply of Military Supplies to Japan, Hoping that US Far East Policy Will Enter a New Era

(Chongqing) Chinese people are deeply gratified by the recent trend of US policy towards the Far East, and hope that the US will provide further assistance to China through the amendment of the current Neutrality Act. Zhu Jia-hua, president of the Chinese League of Nations Association, and Wang Shi-jie, vice president, sent two telegrams today to Pittman, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Nye. The content of the telegrams is as follows:

Telegram to Pittman: Chinese people are deeply gratified by your country's recent policies on the Sino-Japanese War, in support of international justice and the dignity of treaties. Your country's forceful note to Japan on December 31, 1938, and the fervent legislative movement in President Roosevelt's message on January 4 this year, are all regarded by the Chinese people as signs of the dawn of a new era in American Far Eastern diplomacy. What is even more gratifying is that the sacred principles that you have worked to uphold in recent years have been clearly shown to be victorious by recent events. We firmly believe that China's long-term resistance to Japanese aggression for the past eighteen months is arousing a thorough understanding of the aggressor's ambitions among the majority of the American public, thereby increasing their enthusiasm for assisting China. President Roosevelt's advocacy of taking active steps against treaty-breaking aggressors is in line with the will of Chairman Chiang, who has repeatedly stated that China's resistance to Japan is to safeguard the treaties and oppose the sanctions of violence. We hope that based on this belief and policy, these two great nations on opposite sides of the Pacific will cooperate more closely to defend democracy and world peace. Now that your government and people have begun to move towards a new policy, and you are the backbone of implementing this new policy, guiding your country to greater and more practical efforts, a bright future can be predicted. With Britain preparing to cooperate with your country, the success of the new policy is bound to be possible. The United States should amend the current Neutrality Act as a reasonable retaliation for Japan's destruction of American economic interests in China, and the supply of military supplies and credit loans to Japan should be completely stopped as soon as possible. China's hope for the continuation of your country's cooperation and the advancement of assistance cannot be expressed enough.

Telegram to Nye: Chinese people are deeply looking forward to and admiring the intention of your country's Congress to amend the Neutrality Act. With the efforts of you and other leaders, the public will surely understand that the Neutrality Act is no longer suitable for the current situation in the Far East. Japan's aggression against China, as facts show, urgently requires the United States to make a clear choice between the aggressor and the anti-aggressor as soon as possible. Your country's current Neutrality Act, announced in May 1937, was made when the crisis in the Far East was not yet very acute, and there is no doubt that it is not suitable for today's situation. According to the provisions of the Neutrality Act, it is actually beneficial to Japan and not beneficial to China. The recent movement to amend this legislation is enough to foreshadow the bright future of the Far East. China is resisting for its own independence and world peace, and the United States' decision to express this is believed to make a significant contribution to peace and the security order in the Pacific. We sincerely hope that with your outstanding reputation and leadership position, the US Far Eastern policy will enter a new and powerful era. (Telegram, 13th)

### Britain and the United States Should Take Swift Action to Assist China Immediately - Responsible Chinese-Speaking Reuters Reporter - Currency is the First Priority, the Danger of Delay Should Not be Ignored

(Chongqing) According to a Chinese-speaking Reuters reporter today, the power to determine China's fate and the future of the Pacific is now in the hands of Britain. It is hoped that Britain and the United States will not neglect the need for swift action in the Far East while working to resolve various European issues. If China is deemed worthy of assistance, then assistance should be implemented immediately without any delay, as immediate assistance will be of doubled value. Assistance to China's currency is the first priority, followed by other various proactive measures. The current lull in the war, with an unpredictable future, is indeed a critical period, and action at this time seems to be more effective than later. China's resistance is currently showing no signs of weakening, and the goodwill of democratic countries is beyond doubt. The danger of delay if democratic countries want to influence events in the Far East should not be ignored. Britain's prestige in China has recently increased greatly, exceeding what it should be for its real assistance to China. The time for democratic countries to fulfill their promises has now arrived, and the United States is agreeable, as the United States has clearly announced its support for establishing a tough line of action. May the mistakes of Britain and the United States regarding the Manchurian Incident not be repeated today. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

(London) The Daily Mail today printed a report on the front page by its Tianjin correspondent describing his voyage along the Chinese coast, detailing how Japan is obstructing British commerce in every way. The correspondent also solemnly relayed the views of foreign businessmen in North China, who believe that if Britain does not find a way to resist this unfair oppression, British trade in China will cease to exist.

### Roosevelt's Message to Congress Presents a Major National Defense Plan with Military Expenditure of $525 Million to Protect the Security of the Americas Without Aggression

(Washington) President Roosevelt's special message on national defense, which everyone was eagerly awaiting, was delivered to Congress today. It stated, "Our current military strength is too weak and should be strengthened immediately." The President did not yield to any "hysteria," saying that it is now necessary to clearly state that since the end of the World War, there have been major changes in the conflicts between countries, as has been the case in the past five or six years. Although the United States joined the World War on April 6, 1917, it did not participate in any major battles until the end of May 1918, and it was not until the autumn of 1918 that the American army at the front line almost exclusively used British and French artillery and aircraft. This proves that the United States was not yet prepared for large-scale land and air warfare in 1917. Our preparations today are not comparatively better than they were at that time. We cannot guarantee that we will not be attacked for a long time, and every American should compare the current defense with the possibility of the United States being attacked. After careful study of our most urgent needs, I must apply to this Congress for immediate approval of an expenditure of $525,000,000, of which $210,000,000 will be actually allocated by the Ministry of Finance before the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 1940. After review, it is felt that $450,000,000 of the requested approval should be applied to the new needs of the army, $65,000,000 should be applied to the new needs of the navy, and $10,000,000 should be applied to train civilian aircraft pilots. As far as the army is concerned, information from various countries makes us believe that our aircraft calculations must be completely revised. None of the responsible officers advocate building our air force and making its total number of aircraft or aircraft manufacturing capacity equal to the air force of some other countries. We are thinking about the necessary defense, and the inevitable conclusion is that our current military strength is too weak and should be strengthened immediately. It is now planned to purchase various types of aircraft for the army with $300,000,000. This should be stipulated to increase the number of aircraft by at least 3,000, but it is now hoped that they should be ordered in a procedure that greatly reduces the unit cost and actually increases the number of products. Today's progress in military aviation is unprecedented and alarming. The surge in the speed and production capacity of overseas aircraft has changed our need for air defense. If the requested funds can be quickly approved, I propose that $50,000,000 of the $300,000,000 for aircraft be used to correct the shortcomings of the current reduction in the number of aircraft produced due to factory laxity. The proposed plan will greatly enhance the air defense of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Panama Canal area, and it is also advocated to allocate $110,000,000 as an emergency expense for essential equipment, such as aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, light and heavy artillery, bullets, and gas masks. It is also advocated to allocate about $32,000,000 for "education and training" expenses, and the remaining funds will be used to strengthen the defenses of Panama, Hawaii, and the American continent. He then said that the navy's estimate of $65,000,000 should be divided, with $44,000,000 to establish new naval bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and to strengthen the existing naval bases in these two oceans, and about $21,000,000 to increase naval aircraft, aviation materials, and for all kinds of experiments. National defense now requires an increase in the number of trained aviators every year. He believes that after cooperating with educational institutions, a budget of $10,000,000 per year can provide preliminary aviation training to 20,000 civilians. Regarding the Panama Canal, he said that the garrison in peacetime is not sufficient to defend this link, which is vital to the United States. The permanent troops in the Canal Zone should be increased to have the minimum number of air defenses and to maintain coastal defenses to secure the canal's defenses. Therefore, he advocated allocating $27,000,000 to equip the Canal Zone with a sufficient peacetime garrison and to build adequate barracks. The President concluded by saying that every citizen knows the government's desire for peace, and the people know that we have no thoughts of aggression and no aspirations for territorial expansion. However, as the incumbent chief executive, I must be realistic. We have noble heredity in our personality and character, but without modern weapons and without adequate training, our character, no matter how high, will be at a loss when attacked. We should not force the youth of the entire country to enter the battlefield with inferior weapons. The procedures proposed now are by no means "hysteria," but our minimum needs. Therefore, I firmly believe that Congress will take swift action on this urgent procedure to strengthen the national defense of the United States. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### US Aircraft Production Can Be Greatly Increased, 5,000 Aircraft Can Be Built Annually

(Washington) When President Roosevelt read the national defense message to Congress today, the members of both houses of Congress were silent. The members of the military committees will use this message as a blueprint to propose concrete plans, which will be submitted to the committees for review and then submitted to Congress for discussion. Regarding the expansion of the air force, the President's request is much lower than expected by military and diplomatic circles, even the most conservative people. However, the working conditions of the American aircraft factories are mostly not as fast as estimated by experts at the beginning of last year. Delays in certain parts of the military aircraft manufacturing process are also a real situation. This is why the President advocated immediately allocating 50 million US dollars to reopen the closed factories. According to the information, in the fiscal year 1937, the aircraft factories built a total of 858 aircraft for the army and navy. According to the manufacturing procedures in 1939, the factories should have built 1,150 aircraft. However, although the work is very intense, it is feared that the delivery will not be satisfactory. According to the experts, the manufacturing procedures will be in vain unless the factories are able to manufacture in large quantities. In the current situation, the delivery of large bombers built by the factories is slow, while the builders of fighters and small bombers have exceeded the planned procedures. It must be adjusted to be effective (Havas dispatch, 12th)

New York Rogers, president of the American Aviation Industries Chamber of Commerce, recently submitted a report on aircraft manufacturing and production capacity, stating that the number of aircraft built by American aircraft factories can be increased, and 5,000 military aircraft can be built annually. As for 1938, the factories built a total of 3,675 aircraft of various types, of which 1,500 were military aircraft. "However, the factories are not working at full capacity, and some factories are practically idle." By the end of last year, the average monthly production of military aircraft by the factories had reached 200. "If the government needs to build 5,500 military aircraft annually in the future, it will not be difficult." The aircraft manufacturing procedures set by the government include giant bombers with four engines. The number of factory workers should be increased from 16,000 to 74,000. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

### Roosevelt's Message Adequately Timed; New York Newspapers Approve

(New York) Today, New York newspapers all approve of President Roosevelt's national defense message to Congress, stating that the President's procedure is adequately timed and that this procedure has a reasonable balance. If its purpose were to dispatch troops to Europe to participate in another European war, it would not be expanded. Furthermore, this procedure can allow the United States to possess influence over all developments in Europe and Asia that will involve the United States. (Reuters, 13th)

(London) Today, The Times stated that the characteristic of President Roosevelt's defense program is to clearly explain the necessity of protecting the Panama Canal. The President has made this detailed explanation of the urgent need for national defense, fulfilling his statement made last week. The American Congress will not be led to believe that any part of the United States faces any real danger of sudden attack. However, there are always possibilities of developments in South America, and perhaps even more so in the Pacific, all of which could endanger interests that the United States considers vital, and which it will spare no sacrifice to preserve. The United States must be prepared to defend itself, and only then can its opinions and interests be normally respected in the conferences of nations. (Reuters, 13th)

(Berlin) U.S. President Roosevelt's national defense message to Congress has recently been fiercely criticized by newspapers here, which unanimously stated that President Roosevelt's claim that the totalitarian countries have the possibility of invading the American continent is "indeed" unfounded. The purpose is to have military industries hire more workers, thereby reducing unemployment, so that workers will all elect President Roosevelt for a third consecutive term in next year's election. This is an electoral strategy. The Berliner Tageblatt stated that President Roosevelt's claim that the Americas are susceptible to invasion is "absurd and ridiculous." (Havas, 13th)

### Hitler Receives Russian Envoy; Talks for a Long Time

(Berlin) Today at noon, Chancellor Hitler received the diplomatic corps at the new Chancellery building. Diplomatic circles here are extremely interested in his conversation with the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador, Merekalov. (Havas, 11th)

(Reuters, 13th)

### Polish Parliamentarians Clash Over Ukrainian Issue

Warsaw: Yesterday, parliamentarians from the Polish and Ukrainian ethnic groups clashed within the Parliamentary Budget Committee. Ukrainian parliamentarian Selenewick pointed out that the Ukrainian issue within Poland has become a stalemate, and its tensions are increasing daily. There are two opinions within the Polish nation regarding the treatment of Ukrainians. Leaders like the late Dmowski of the National Democratic Party do not recognize the existence of Ukrainians and want to revoke their citizenship. Conversely, the late President Piłsudski advocated that the existence of Ukrainians was beneficial to Poland. However, after Piłsudski's death, Dmowski's faction quickly gained the upper hand in Poland. Selenewick today demanded that the Polish government announce a large-scale plan to treat Ukrainian residents equally, so that Ukrainian youth have the possibility of developing their future. Polish parliamentarian Wacławler rebuked Selenewick's speech as a discourse from outside Poland, an attitude that Polish citizens should not have. Wacławler claimed that he fundamentally does not recognize the name "Ukrainian," and only knows that this is the "Ruthenian" problem. He further blamed the current tensions on the Ukrainian autonomy movement. Ukrainians considered Wacławler's speech to be intentionally insulting. This dispute will be handled by the Parliamentary Court of Honor. Prime Minister Składkowski guaranteed that Poland has no intention of eliminating the Ukrainian nation. (Haitong, 13th)

### Roosevelt's Wording Moderate; Many Legislators Find It Unusual; All Recommendations Likely to Pass; European Situation Has Great Influence

(Washington) Members of Congress found President Roosevelt's special message to Congress regarding national defense to be unusually moderate in its wording. It is generally expected that all of the President's recommendations will be passed by Congress without serious opposition. Those in Congress who have expressed dissatisfaction so far are only Republican Congressman Fish. Republican Senate Leader Vandenberg said that the threat from overseas is, in his opinion, even greater than what President Roosevelt has said, but it is doubtful. However, since this recommendation comes from the Commander-in-Chief of the nation, it should be respected and given attention. Democratic Senator Wagner said that he regrets that the United States is using this huge amount of money on weapons, but if today's world situation is indeed urgent, the request is still moderate. Republican Senator Nye, who was expected to attack it, is now silent. It is generally believed that the news carried in European newspapers will make it easier for the President's recommendations to pass. (Reuters, 13th)

(Washington) Immediately after President Roosevelt submitted his national defense message today, Congress should authorize the government to build naval bases and manufacture aircraft in addition to the existing military program, and approve additional budgets to start construction or begin manufacturing immediately. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, commented on the President's message, saying, "This message is accurate and conservative, and is indeed a document crucial to the survival of the American nation." Democratic Senator Meter declared, "This is an explanation of the United States' national defense needs in a conservative spirit. I believe Congress will quickly adopt it." Republican Senator Nye said, "What this message requests is far less than what most people imagined, showing that the President has sensed the reaction of public opinion to certain suggestions." Labor Senator Sheppard Stade said, "The President and the Army and Navy authorities have information that we do not know. What is the reason why the authorities must increase defense expenditures? Please explain." After the national defense message was released, the stock prices in New York fell, especially those of aircraft manufacturers. Financial figures commented that the number of additional aircraft to be built was far below what most people had expected, and the market was inevitably disappointed, so stock prices fell. (Havas, 12th)

### Soviet Union Bolsters National Defense

(Moscow) According to official claims, the Soviet Union has decided to accelerate its defense industry and has completely reorganized the People's Commissariat of Defense Industry, which is now divided into four People's Commissariats: Aviation, Shipbuilding, Ordnance, and Armaments. This move reflects the expansion of the Soviet defense industry following the increase in the army and navy budget. According to last year's Soviet army and navy budget, it increased by 35 percent compared to 1937, including 400 million pounds for war industries, reaching over 1 billion pounds in total. (Reuters, 13th)

(Moscow) Officials have commented on the division of the Soviet Supreme Soviet's People's Commissariat of Defense Industry into four committees: aviation, shipbuilding, munitions, and armaments, stating that this move clearly aims to intensify the production of military supplies and bolster the strength of both the navy and air force. Previously, in November 1937, the navy had separated from the People's Commissariat of Defense and became independent, and a separate People's Commissariat of Machinery was established to assist it. By the end of 1938, the working methods of various aircraft manufacturing plants were improved, increasing production by 15 to 26 percent. Various other defense industries were also improved at the beginning of this year, and a People's Commissariat for Military Textiles was added. Now that the People's Commissariat of Defense Industry has been divided into four committees, there are a total of 29 People's Commissariats related to national defense. The Soviet government's determination to strengthen national defense can be seen from this. (Havas, 12th)

### French New Battleship Prototype

(Paris) The 35,000-ton battleship "Richelieu," which began construction on October 22, 1935, is scheduled to be launched on the 17th of this month at the Port of Brest, and will be fully completed in early 1940, joining the fleet for service. This ship is 245 meters long and 33 meters wide, and can carry 60 officers and 1,500 soldiers. The average speed is at least 31 knots per hour, and it is equipped with several engines totaling 150,000 horsepower, weighing 3,000 tons. The hull is protected by thick steel, enabling it to defend against bombs, shells, and torpedoes. Its armaments include eight 380-millimeter (equivalent to 15 inches) cannons, capable of launching 900-kilogram shells to a distance of over 40 kilometers, fifteen 150-millimeter (equivalent to 6 inches) cannons, twelve 100-millimeter (equivalent to 4 inches) cannons, several anti-aircraft guns, and several machine guns.

### Chamberlain Returns Home Early; Anglo-Italian Talks Unfruitful; Mussolini Insists on Ambitions Towards France; Also Unwilling to Resolve Spanish Issue

(Rome) The formal talks between British and Italian authorities concluded yesterday. Prime Minister Chamberlain is returning to London two days earlier than scheduled, leading some to believe that the outcome of this trip, from a diplomatic standpoint, is entirely nil. Yesterday afternoon's talks seemed less amicable than those of the previous night. Chamberlain and Mussolini seemed to have found no common ground for continued meetings, or any hope of establishing an Anglo-Italian agreement, or any reason for closer cooperation on larger issues for the sake of the future of peace. It is said that although Mussolini has not yet presented a plan for demands on France, he has by no means diminished his so-called natural desire for the country, nor has he slightly changed his policy of aiding the Spanish Nationalist forces. If Mussolini expected Chamberlain to be a facilitator for French concessions for the sake of European appeasement, then he is now fully aware of Britain's attitude. If Franco-Italian disputes take an orderly path of negotiation, then Britain is willing to mediate to help achieve reconciliation, but Britain believes that Italy's anti-French demonstrations run counter to peace, so it is no wonder that France has adopted a passive attitude. Italy may advocate convening a four-power conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, but disputes directly related to France and Italy should not become a matter for a four-power conference. It is expected that Mussolini expressed his desire to maintain peace and stated that disputes within his country would not hinder Anglo-Italian friendship during his talks with Chamberlain. It is generally expected that Mussolini has reiterated his promise to maintain the Mediterranean status quo and not to seek special privileges in Spain. Both Britain and Italy also expressed regret over the huge cost of the arms race, but both sides have not been able to put forward any constructive suggestions. The Jewish refugee issue was also mentioned in the talks. However, trade matters, although Italy hopes that Britain will purchase more of its products, apparently did not involve any special discussions. Therefore, although this decision-making conversation is not as beneficial as Chamberlain hoped, it has at least dispelled doubts in both sides' minds about each other's opinions. Mussolini's correct intentions have not yet been explained, but it is known that even though Britain and France have formed a united front, Italy still wants to rely on its Axis powers, namely Germany's assistance, and actively pursue its desires. The lack of results of the talks can now be seen in the disappointed public here. (Reuters, 13th)

(Rome) Well-informed sources here recently declared that this trip by British cabinet members has almost failed in a political sense. The underlying cause is the demands made by Italy regarding the African issue. It is said that the wishes expressed by the Italian authorities were only listened to by the British cabinet members and were not commented on. Regarding this level, it has recently been proven that the views and interests held by the British and French governments are completely consistent. However, the Italian authorities still believe that although it is difficult to separate Britain and France, they can at least urge Britain to mediate or propose convening a four-power conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. In essence, Italy wants to involve the entire Europe in its demands regarding the African issue. British Prime Minister Chamberlain said that this is a matter for France and Italy and does not want to interfere, advocating that the Italian government should directly contact the French government and ordering the newspapers to moderate their anti-French rhetoric. In short, the result of the talks between the British and Italian authorities is only this. Italian political circles and foreigners are deeply impressed. Although the Italian side did not express anything, the British delegation expressed pessimism about the future of the Mediterranean issue. Although Italian officials said that Prime Minister Chamberlain would postpone his return to the country until the 14th of this month, and would continue to talk with Prime Minister Mussolini for the next two days, the British people do not see this as certain. (Havas, 12th)

### British Prime Minister Silent; Only Exchanged Opinions on Major Issues; Italian Foreign Minister Notifies German and Japanese Ambassadors

(Rome) The formal talks between Chamberlain and Halifax of the British side and Mussolini and Ciano of the Italian side began at 5:35 p.m. yesterday and ended at 6:50 p.m., lasting 75 minutes. After Chamberlain left the meeting, he was surrounded by reporters but did not say a word. The British Prime Minister felt slightly ill and looked tired. Mussolini and Ciano remained in the Prime Minister's office for 15 minutes after the British Prime Minister and others withdrew. It is generally expected that a public statement will be issued today. It is said that neither side put forward or established any binding agreements or compromises or methods during the meeting, and only completed the task of reviewing the European situation that began on Wednesday, presenting their respective positions and fully understanding each other's positions. Last night, the general impression in political circles was that although the tone of the talks remained friendly throughout, there is currently no hope for progress on major issues such as the Suez Canal, Tunis, Spain, and armaments. It is said that Mussolini spoke a lot about the Spanish issue in yesterday's talks, advocating that the Nationalist forces be given the rights of belligerents, and expressing that this move is necessary to clarify the situation, especially the Mediterranean situation. He also said that if the rights of belligerents are given to the Nationalist forces, Italy can consider continuing to withdraw Italian volunteers from Spain. According to what the British in Rome know, the Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister only stated the general situation of Italy's world position and did not specifically mention any demands or ask for Britain's response. At most, what Italy hopes for in this Anglo-Italian talk is greater British sympathy and understanding for Italy. German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano for a long time after the British Foreign Minister and others left the Palazzo Venezia. It is believed that Ciano has informed the German ambassador of the events discussed in the Anglo-Italian talks. Japanese Ambassador Shiratori Minoru also visited Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for half an hour after the Anglo-Italian talks, which is also worthy of attention. (Reuters, 12th)

(Rome) The British and Italian cabinet members continued their talks this afternoon and issued a public statement afterward stating, "Prime Minister Mussolini held talks with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Minister Lord Halifax at the Palazzo Venezia at 5:30 p.m. Ciano was also present, which lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes before ending." Diplomatic circles here all declared that the Anglo-Italian talks have virtually ended, and neither side has accepted any of the bindings. It is not yet known whether the two sides have substantially agreed on certain definite issues. Well-informed sources said that the Anglo-Italian talks did not yield substantial results, and the final public statement should be released, stating that the process was very harmonious and that both sides are willing to promote friendly relations. British political figures said that the Anglo-Italian talks did not establish an agreement, but only clarified the positions on the European situation and the important issues in the Mediterranean. According to reliable sources, Prime Minister Mussolini and Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke very little during this afternoon's talks, and only Foreign Minister Ciano and Foreign Minister Halifax explained their respective views. The general atmosphere at that time can be seen from this. (Havas, 12th)

### Anglo-Italian Talks Fail; London Securities Plunge

(London) The results of Chamberlain's Rome talks have failed to arouse excitement in all sectors here. Although it is not convenient to make a final assessment of the Rome talks before the details arrive, Londoners are already disappointed with it, which can be seen from the general decline in securities trading prices. The sale of government bonds is very strong, because sellers believe that the recent upward trend in prices is difficult to maintain when there is no real progress in the European situation. (Reuters, 13th)

### Chamberlain's Attitude Firm; French Newspapers Express Satisfaction; Italian Newspapers' Comments Are Irrelevant; British Newspapers Believe Air Has Cleared

(London) Regarding the talks between the British and Italian cabinet members, The Times recently carried a telegram from a Rome correspondent, claiming that this talk was dedicated to exploration and explanation. Other newspapers hold similar views. All newspapers that support Prime Minister Chamberlain's appeasement policy all express their approval of the Prime Minister's firm attitude after agreeing with France. Opposition newspapers have also temporarily stopped attacking the government's current policy. The Times stated, "The British and Italian cabinet members have talked freely about the general European situation. It is too early to draw a conclusion at this time. What is known is that the air has cleared." The Daily Mail stated, "Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini failed to agree on the issue of the Spanish civil war. Mussolini also wants to convene a four-power conference to discuss various outstanding issues, such as Italy's desire for French-owned Tunisia in North Africa, which is one end of it. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately stated that Britain would support France under all circumstances. Prime Minister Mussolini also replied that Italy's policy should be backed by the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo triangle." The News Chronicle stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain's trip was in vain, which was expected by the British side. On the contrary, the Italian newspapers had greatly publicized it, and now that the result is like this, the political circles in that country must feel disappointed. (Havas, 13th)

(Paris) Today, newspapers here praised British Prime Minister Chamberlain's firm attitude expressed during his meeting with Mussolini, and stated that Rome can now understand that the solidity of the Anglo-French union is no less than the Rome-Berlin Axis. Italy's attempt to apply the Munich system in the Mediterranean has failed. (Reuters, 13th)

(Rome) This morning, the comments in newspapers here regarding the meeting between Chamberlain and Mussolini used vague and noncommittal language. What they said was the harmonious situation during the meeting, but they did not detail the results. (Reuters, 13th)

(Berlin) Regarding the talks between the British and Italian cabinet members in Rome, German newspapers are unwilling to comment because they have not received accurate information, and only reprint the news carried by Italian newspapers. It is claimed that the talks were conducted in a friendly atmosphere and that they reached a compromise in principle. Among them, the Frankfurter Zeitung stated that if the two sides do not conduct further discussions on various special issues, then general concepts will not be too disparate." However, the Spanish civil war is one of the special issues. "Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is determined to have the Nationalist government achieve victory. British authorities also know that the Nationalist forces have made significant progress in recent weeks and it will not be difficult to achieve final victory. All of this is real. However, the result of the talks is still without concrete achievement." (Havas, 13th)

### Chamberlain Visits the Pope; Talks for Half an Hour

Vatican City: British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Minister Lord Halifax, and British Envoy to the Holy See Osborne, went to the Vatican from Villa Madama this morning to visit Pope Pius XI. A large number of people welcomed them along the way. Upon arriving at the Vatican, hundreds of British young students from various colleges also cheered and paid their respects. After the British cabinet members arrived at the palace, the Pope received them in his private library and talked with them for half an hour. The British cabinet members then met with Cardinal Secretary of State Pacelli. Afterward, they went to the British Embassy to the Holy See for lunch. Cardinal Pacelli then went to pay his respects in return. (Havas, 13th)

### Fierce Fighting in Spain; Nationalist Forces Continue to Advance

Burgos: After launching a large-scale offensive, the Nationalist forces occupied Tortosa today. Several divisions of the Moroccan Legion led by General Yagüe have occupied the area between the Ebro River and the coast. Its cavalry units played an important role in the Nationalist forces' encirclement movement. The Nationalist forces then arrived at the town of Perillo, which is on the Valencia-Barcelona highway, ten miles north of Tortosa. The three major roads leading to Tarragona are now all under Nationalist control. According to various front-line reports, the Nationalist forces are continuing to advance rapidly in various areas.

(Paris) According to news from here yesterday, the Spanish Nationalist forces have now occupied the town of Falset, an important stronghold on the government forces' defense line, which leads directly to the city of Tarragona.

### Hungary Joins the Anti-Comintern Pact; Hungarian Foreign Minister to Visit Germany

Nanjing: Hungary has recently joined the Anti-Comintern Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

Nanjing: According to political figures here, Hungary will soon formally announce its withdrawal from the League of Nations and join the Anti-Comintern Pact. Hungary's desire to strengthen ties with its traditional allies, Germany and Italy, and to break away from the Geneva orbit has been long-standing. It was discussed before last Christmas when Italian Foreign Minister Ciano visited Nanjing. Berlin and Budapest have also exchanged views through regular diplomatic channels. In recent weeks, Hungarian newspapers have advocated for withdrawing from the League of Nations following Germany and Italy. The recent recognition of Manchukuo is generally seen as a prelude to joining the Anti-Comintern Pact. Political figures believe that after Hungary joins the German-Italian axis, it will adopt a similar attitude towards Yugoslavia and promote friendly relations. The Hungarian-Czech relationship will also be one of the topics discussed during Foreign Minister Szaky's visit to Berlin. It is hoped that Germany's mediation can improve the deteriorating relationship between Hungary and Czechoslovakia. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

### German Embassy in the Netherlands Shot At; German Newspaper Issues Stern Warning

(Berlin) The official publication "Foreign Policy News" has issued a stern warning to the Netherlands, accusing it of undermining neutrality and German-Dutch relations. The newspaper and other German newspapers claim that the shooting incidents targeting German personnel in Amsterdam and the German Embassy in The Hague were carried out by Jews or instigated by Jewish movements. The news report covering the shooting was titled "Another Jewish Attempted Assassination." Jews in Berlin are anxiously asking each other if this will become "another Leyendecker case." According to "Foreign Policy News," Jews around the world seem to have chosen a new battlefield to fight against Germany. The recent shooting in the Netherlands cannot be ignored. The Netherlands must consider whether its tolerance of Jewish subversive activities, which now endangers the representatives sent by the German government to the Netherlands, can still be justified. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency has issued a message stating that regarding the shooting at the German Embassy in The Hague and the residence of German diplomats in Amsterdam, the Dutch Foreign Minister Patijn has expressed his apologies to the German government. However, it is regrettable that Dutch newspapers have failed to fully recognize the dangerous consequences that such crimes could lead to. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

The Hague: According to a dispatch from the Dutch News Agency, regarding the shooting at the German Consulate General in the Netherlands and the Embassy in The Hague, the Dutch authorities have dispatched police and security forces to arrest the perpetrators and have also increased the number of police and security forces guarding the German Consulate General and the German Embassy to protect them. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

(Washington) In addition to focusing on the news of the British-Italian talks in Rome, American newspapers are also paying close attention to the threats to Dutch neutrality made by the Berlin "Foreign Policy News." Members of Congress are also making unfavorable criticisms of these intimidating remarks. A member of Congress told a Reuters reporter that anyone who does not want to be interfered with by fascists must strengthen their military. Fascists will soon demand that we place all American Jews in concentration camps. The only way we can deal with them is to carry President Roosevelt's big stick. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### Mussolini and Ciano Sing a Duet

(London) Regarding the talks between British and Italian ministers in Rome, well-informed sources have stated that the atmosphere and tone used by Prime Minister Chamberlain in his talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini were very different from those used by Foreign Secretary Halifax in his talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. The British delegation found this quite strange. Prime Minister Mussolini's tone was mild and his attitude was very fair, while Foreign Minister Ciano's words were sharp and he agreed to the numerous demands made by France. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Britain and Italy Exchange Military Intelligence

(London) Diplomatic sources here have stated that on the 10th of this month, the British and Italian governments, in accordance with Annex II of the British-Italian Agreement (established on April 16, 1938), exchanged military intelligence through the military, naval, and air attachés of their respective embassies. According to this annex, if there are large-scale deployments of naval, land, and air forces or changes in other administrative personnel stationed in the Mediterranean, Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Egypt, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, British Somaliland, British Kenya, British Uganda, and Italian East Africa, both parties should exchange information in January of each year. Furthermore, if either signatory wishes to build air or naval bases between 19 degrees east longitude in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, they should also notify each other. In addition, whenever one of the signatory countries needs to exchange information due to the political situation, both parties should do so. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

### Memel Chairman to be German

The appointment of Botulies, the German deputy leader of Memel, as Chairman of the Memel Autonomous Region is about to become a reality. Bingen, a member of the Memel German Committee, visited Gaiulis, the Governor of the Memel Region, yesterday to propose the appointment of Botulies as the Chairman of the region. It is reported that the Governor has accepted the proposal. It is believed that Botulies will visit Governor Gaiulis today to express his acceptance of the position. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

Konigsberg: The Governor of Memel has appointed National Socialist Party member Petraitis as Chairman of the Memel Executive Council. All other members of the Council belong to the National Socialist Party. The newly elected parliament, which is dominated by the National Socialist Party, will open at the end of this month. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### Equipment of the New Fourth Army's Rear Hospitals; Service Doctors are Highly Educated; Also Treat Civilians; Many Donations of Medicine from All Sides

Continued communication from Belden, special correspondent of the English-language "North China Daily News": The medical services of the New Fourth Army seem to be better than those of other armies. A special feature of their medical service is that all wounded soldiers are treated by their own army and do not enter military hospitals set up by the Chinese Army Medical Service. The New Fourth Army has set up its own hospital in several temple buildings in a village fifteen miles behind its headquarters. It has 250 beds and is divided into three wards: medical, surgical, and tuberculosis. Many veterans of the old Red Army contracted tuberculosis during the long-term battles with the government. It is questionable whether they can recover, but the New Fourth Army is still caring for them. The hospital has four doctors, nine female nurses (all qualified nurses), thirteen male assistants trained as medical officers and nurses, and twelve nursing students. Attached to the hospital are a pharmacy and a laboratory. In the laboratory, ordinary tests can be performed on blood, feces, and bacteria. The people in the hospital spent 30 yuan to make their own bacterial incubator. If they bought an imported bacterial incubator, it would cost 200 yuan. Due to financial constraints, medical services manufacture bandages, medicine chests, and other items as much as possible. Another hospital is set up in the headquarters of the New Fourth Army. It also has a laboratory and a pharmacy, and wards with 80 beds. There are one male and one female doctor, and six nurses and assistants each. Only those with critical conditions are allowed to enter this hospital. Patients with chronic diseases and those who are seriously injured and need long-term care are sent to the hospital in the village. In the army, each detachment has one doctor and several male nurses. Each regiment has two rigorously trained nurses and 12 to 15 assistants. Each battalion has one nurse and 9 to 12 assistants. Each company has one or two assistants. One thing that is particularly noteworthy about the New Fourth Army's medical services is that the doctors are all qualified physicians. What is even more, they are genuinely interested in their work. They work an average of 12 hours or more each day, performing surgery every morning and visiting the hospital every night, doing their best. This is rare in military hospitals. The walls and washrooms of the hospital are painted white. Slogans promoting hygiene are pasted on the walls of the hospital. All recruits undergo a detailed physical examination by a doctor. Those who suffer from venereal diseases are generally not accepted. The type of work assigned to recruits is also determined by the doctor's examination report. For example, those with weak hearts are of course not recruited as combatants, but they may be able to do other types of work. A "National Salvation Room" has been set up in the hospital, and there is a suggestion box where patients can submit criticisms. The hospital encourages soldiers to read. I saw several soldiers reading books on guerrilla warfare, mass education, and anti-Japanese themes. The New Fourth Army's medical services are different from those of other armies. There are some problems that do not need to be dealt with. The New Fourth Army's battles are not very fierce. Its hospitals are not often in danger of being bombed by planes. The number of wounded soldiers is also very small, and so far the currency is stable and the hospital's work is not hindered. However, the medical staff of the New Fourth Army also treat civilians. When I was at headquarters, an average of 150 civilians were treated each day, free of charge. The army needs the help of the people, so it cannot refuse to treat them. The farmers who have benefited are extremely grateful, and some bring tea and other items to donate to the hospital. The people in the area are in urgent need of medical treatment. Almost all of them suffer from scabies and ulcers. In summer, skin diseases are prevalent. In addition, civilians who have been injured by bullets and bombs near the front lines cannot be ignored by the New Fourth Army. Because the number of orphans admitted to the hospital for treatment is increasing daily, it is not possible to treat them all. Therefore, the medical staff is now planning to open a training class for nurses and health workers, which will start soon in the hospital. However, the New Fourth Army's medical services are not without their difficulties. It is only because of donations from organizations such as the Red Cross that they can continue to work. The royalties from Agnes Smedley's book "China Fights Back" were also donated to the hospital. An engineer from Chongqing once remitted 200 yuan to donate to the hospital. Others donated towels, soap, and bedding. However, if they continue to treat civilians, they must have funds to do so. The daily meal cost for hospitalized patients is two jiao of silver, but the New Fourth Army does not have this much money. Although doctors' salaries are higher than those of anyone else in the army, they are only 50 yuan per month. They could have been air force medical officers and earned 200 yuan a month, or doctors in large city hospitals, where their salaries could be five or six times higher than what they earn now. But they prefer to stay in the army and enjoy their work. Some of the medicines donated by foreigners to China are undignified. For example, the American and German Red Cross Societies donated medicines and bandages manufactured in 1917, which are still stored in the New Fourth Army hospital because they cannot be used.

### Chinese Army on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line to Launch General Counteroffensive Within Days; Situation in Jiaxing and Hangzhou Becomes Increasingly Tense; Japanese Army Continues to Request Assistance from Shanghai; Civilians Flee to Other Places

Jiaxing correspondence: The Chinese army, under Liu Jianxu, and a certain unit of the New Fourth Army, since the 5th, have continuously arrived in the suburbs of Jiaxing in four routes. Some soldiers have changed their clothes and mixed into the city, waiting for orders to launch a counteroffensive to kill the enemy. It is heard that the strategy adopted by the Chinese army is to coordinate from the inside and outside. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese side has dispatched reinforcements of 3,000 men from Shanghai in recent days, stationed in various towns and villages in Jiaxing and along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, such as Wangdian. They are also building fortifications at various strategic points. In the evening, the Japanese army searches houses one by one, and more than a dozen innocent civilians have been arrested and are now being held at the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters. Therefore, the residents of the city are extremely panicked. Those who can afford it are fleeing to Shanghai temporarily, while those who cannot afford to flee far are successively fleeing to the countryside. However, they are all leaving secretly, as the Japanese puppets have announced a ban on residents of the city from fleeing.

Also, it is reported that the Chinese army that crossed the river to Hangzhou has killed many Japanese soldiers in places such as the Hangzhou-Yuyao Highway. The Japanese army is now retreating to Hangzhou. It is heard that the Chinese army's ×× Division has occupied a major town on the outskirts of Hangzhou and will launch a general counteroffensive within days with the Chinese armies in Jiaxing, Pinghu, Haining, Chang'an, Jiashan, Wuxing, Deqing, Tongxiang, and other counties and towns along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Therefore, the Chinese army has secretly notified the people in recent days to evacuate the war zone within a short period of time to avoid danger.

Xie Shi Town, which belongs to Haining County, is a major town along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. Recently, the Japanese army heard that the Chinese army was about to launch a large-scale counteroffensive, so they transported a large number of troops from Shanghai to guard it. A large number of weapons and ammunition were also loaded. At noon on the 7th, another material vehicle arrived at Xie Station from Shanghai. The Japanese army immediately forced laborers to unload it. Unexpectedly, while the workers Zhang Er and Chen Da were carrying it, they dropped a box of bullets, which broke on the spot. The box did not contain bullets, but was filled with stones. The Japanese army's move was probably intended to create a false impression.

### Brief News from Jiangyin; Puppet County Government Organizes Puppet Municipal Office; Plans to Impose Land Tax

Jiangyin correspondence: The streets of Chengyi City were destroyed by artillery fire and arson by the Japanese army. Today, dilapidated walls and ruins are everywhere. Now, the puppet police have hired workers to dismantle the remaining ownerless houses, bricks, and tiles, and sell them all.

After the puppet magistrate He Peiyi took office, the names of the general small puppets under his jurisdiction are kept secret. In addition to the puppet county government, a puppet municipal office was also organized, with He concurrently serving as the puppet mayor, and Zhang Huijun and Lin Songming as puppet deputy mayors. Zhang is a shop assistant at the Wanyusen silk shop and was once the town chief of Chunhui Town. In May of last year, he curry favored with Zhang Jianmen. He first worked as an accountant at Zhengli Foreign Firm, and then claimed to be a representative of the people to attend the puppet provincial people's congress of the puppet Reformed Government in Nanjing. He is truly a shameless person who recognizes a thief as his father. Lin Songming is the owner of the Jiuhua silk shop and was once a member of the Chamber of Commerce and chairman of the Silk and Cloth Association. After the two became puppet deputy mayors, they wanted to revitalize the city and coveted the so-called Jiangyin reconstruction loan of more than 14,200 yuan allocated by the puppet provincial government, but this is still difficult to achieve.

After Ishii was transferred from the Jiangyin Japanese Army Garrison Commander, the successor was Fuji Take. Fuji Take is irritable and likes to kill. If a small thief is caught in the city, he is either shot or beheaded. The two or three hundred soldiers under his command and the twenty or thirty military police ride motorcycles and bicycles through the streets from morning to night, charging and crashing. If pedestrians cannot avoid them in time, they are knocked down, injured, or killed, which is commonplace. After Che Zhonghuan, a member of the Japanese Army Special Agents Team, went to Suzhou, the only traitors Jiang Yaoting and Pang Mingqiu in Jiangyin were unable to gain a foothold. They were further squeezed out by the traitor Zhang Chuangmen, who reported various malpractices of Jiang and Pang to the Japanese Army Special Agents Department, which led to their distant arrest by the military police and detention for three days. Later, they were bailed out through various means. Jiang and Pang have recently gone to Suzhou together, and the city of Jiangyin has suddenly lost this pair of monsters.

Qiaoji Town, which is close to the war zone, has the wealthy Wu Zishu and his brother Zimai, who dominate Southern Qiaoji. They usually start their businesses in the industry. They previously decided to privately sell more than 60 pieces of Japanese yarn and were fined a large sum of money by patriots. The town has recently been stationed by the Japanese army, and the market is completely deserted. The north and south Qiaoji are now closed. A wall is built on the bridge, and unexpected events occur. Qiaoji was extremely lively. In recent years, young men and women have long gone elsewhere, leaving only the old and weak on the streets.

The puppet county government is implementing a search and seize plan, and is eager to collect land tax. The first step is to organize the original district registers. Those who are forced by adultery to register are 361 households, and those who refuse to register are 315 households in Caoxiang and 147 households in Shaxiang. The puppet county government is now urging them to do so. In addition, the large amount of rice stored by the county government in the past has now been sold out. There is a shortage of rice in the city, and there are merchants in the countryside who collude with the Japanese to secretly purchase rice and load it onto Japanese ships from the port of Changyinsha Huangtian and transport it to Japan. A rice famine is likely to occur this spring.

### Magistrate of Fengxian County Begins Work

The puppet government also appointed a puppet administrator. Fengxian communication: Fengxian is the center of southern Pudong. Thanks to the efforts of Liao Xisan, commander of the 8th Detachment of the Loyal and Patriotic National Salvation Army, all local administration is still maintained by the district offices in their original state. Now, in order to increase the strength of the anti-Japanese war in the guerrilla areas, the provincial government has selected cadres from various counties in southern Pudong to be in charge of county administration. The post of Fengxian has also been filled by the provincial civil affairs department, which has appointed Ruan Kaikai, the former magistrate of Chuansha County, to take over. After Ruan was commissioned, he went to Fengxian to take up his post. He has selected a certain place as the county government and began to work on January 1. On the one hand, he began to organize the people's self-defense regiment to maintain law and order. He also learned that the commissioner's office of the Third District recently appointed Ding Xisan as the deputy commander of the self-defense regiment of the Third District, so that national defense and provincial defense can be linked together.

The Japanese side has included all counties in southern Pudong into the territory of the puppet municipal government. Jinshan and Nanhui Counties in Chuannan already had a puppet government administration. Therefore, their desire to conquer Fengxian is even more urgent. Although they have repeatedly decided to send troops to invade, there has been no result. The appeasement team originally sent to Fengxian is still lingering in Minhang and cannot proceed. In the past two months, many members of the appeasement team have been trying to influence local people in the county and have proposed several names, such as So-and-so, to lure them with large sums of money, but they have not been fooled. As their plans failed, they recommended Ma Tianjian from Minhang and reported him to the puppet municipal government for appointment as the puppet administrator of Fengxian. Ma was a rural teacher there. Seeing the great strength of the National Salvation Army, he did not dare to agree. Later, with the strong support of the appeasement team, he allowed them to send a large puppet police team as bodyguards, and the Japanese army sent a team to lead the way before he took office. It is said that Ma has appointed So-and-so from Fengxian, who has been serving in the puppet organization, as the chief of the First and Second Departments. However, all circles in Fengxian have always advocated a policy of non-cooperation, so even if Ma comes with external force, it will be difficult for him to realize his official dream.

### Japanese Army in Suqian and Tianchang in Dire Straits; About to be Annihilated; Crouching in the City Unable to Escape

Huaiyin correspondence: The Japanese army in northern Jiangsu, which invaded Suqian, Suining, and Liuhe Tianchang, has been besieged and suppressed by the Chinese army and retreated to the city. They are in dire straits. Recently, the Japanese army has been in danger of being annihilated by the Chinese army. A special record of the situation is as follows:

Suqian

The total number of Japanese troops in Suining City and Suqian City, together with the towns of Lingcheng, Gengche, Sankeshu, Shunheji, etc. under the two counties, is less than 1,500. In addition, the Chinese army and local guerrillas have repeatedly attacked them recently. The Japanese army deeply feels that they cannot attend to everything. Therefore, they dare not slack in maintaining the traffic line of the Suqian-Suining Highway to prevent the Chinese army from cutting off their connection. However, it is heard that the Chinese army has now changed its strategy of attack and has secretly sent political workers to various troops and guerrillas to make practical connections and make overall plans to annihilate the Japanese army on the Suqian-Suining Line. In addition, the Japanese army in Shunheji, Suqian County, was attacked by the Chinese army on the evening of New Year's Day this year. More than a dozen Japanese soldiers were beheaded, causing the Japanese army to panic and fire their guns wildly. The Chinese army safely returned to their original defenses after completing their mission. Now the Japanese army is deeply afraid of another night attack by the Chinese army, so they have set up landmines around Shunheji. However, the Chinese army has secretly sent a commando team to destroy the landmines and is preparing to take the opportunity to annihilate all the Japanese troops in Shunheji. Also, at 4:00 p.m. on the 4th of this month, more than a dozen transport vehicles departed from Suqian City, each carrying a small number of Japanese soldiers, and drove towards Sixian County. When they passed Buzi Ji, they were repelled by the Chinese army head-on and fled back to Suqian City. According to military intelligence, the Japanese army stationed in Suqian City is numbered "Royal Association Army Xuanwu Department" and has less than 500 men, including 300 puppet troops (all forced to serve by the people in Xuzhou and other places), more than 30 Tangke vehicles, armored vehicles, and transport vehicles. Recently, because the Chinese army often carries out night attacks, the Japanese army has equipped two machine guns on each gate tower in Suqian City and fires indiscriminately from time to time. The Japanese army in Shunheji, Suqian, has more than 100 men and a small team of appeasement teams. A few days ago, they distributed ridiculous "peace-seeking" leaflets. It is heard that seven ignorant residents went to the Japanese army's appeasement team in Shunheji to register. The team immediately asked them to confess where the residents' self-defense guns were. Because the ignorant residents' statements were unclear, they were all shot dead. The Japanese army in Gengche, Suqian, has more than 200 men and three cannons. The Chinese army launched a night attack a few days ago and annihilated more than half of them. Recently, the Japanese army is rushing to build fortifications and dares not take any offensive action.

Tianchang

The Japanese army, consisting of more than 300 infantry, cavalry, and artillery troops, invaded Tianchang and Liuhe from Puzhen Yangzhou. However, they were repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army in Gtang Ji, Xinjie, Huangnibadu, Majia Ji, and other places, causing heavy casualties. They were also constantly attacked by the nearby Chinese guerrillas, and their strength has been greatly reduced. As for the several battles in Qinlan and Renhe Ji, the Chinese defenders were brave and severely damaged the Japanese army. At present, the more than 300 Japanese troops in Qinlan and Renhe Ji are like bandits, fleeing in all directions. The villages within a dozen miles around them have suffered greatly. Now, because the Japanese army's rear is empty and the Chinese guerrillas are becoming increasingly active, and they are also being pressured by the Chinese army, they have begun to waver and flee back. It is heard that there are 200 Japanese troops in Tianchang City, stubbornly resisting the danger. In addition to intensifying the encirclement and laying ambushes in the suburbs, the Chinese army also used artillery to bombard the city. Seeing the power of the Chinese army's heavy weapons, the remaining troops were terrified and seemed to be trying to break through the siege. As for the 600 Japanese troops who were fleeing northwest along the highway, after being intercepted by the Chinese army in Yangcun, they have entered a state of confrontation. The Tianchang County Government and its subordinate agencies have all moved to ×× Town to work. As for the Japanese troops who invaded Tianchang, they suffered heavy casualties. A few days ago, seven large trucks fully loaded with the bodies of Japanese soldiers arrived in Yangzhou from Dayi. Each truck had 30 bodies, which were wrapped in tarpaulins. After unloading them at the east gate of Yangzhou at 5:00 p.m., martial law was imposed and traffic was prohibited. At about 6:00 a.m. the next morning, they were cremated.

### Chen Mu's Local Tyrant Exploits Japanese Troops, Deceives Them into Town, and Squeezes Farmers' Blood and Sweat

A Kunshan dispatch: Chen Mu Town in Kunshan County is located 45 li southwest of the county seat. It is a major town in the western countryside. Historical records state that when Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty crossed south, Consort Chen was buried here, hence the name Chen Mu. The town is surrounded by a network of harbors and relies solely on waterways for transportation with the outside world. After the August 13th Incident the year before last, many Kunshan city residents sought refuge here, considering it a paradise.

The town is jointly administered by Wu County and Kunshan County. The customs, habits, language, and lifestyle of the townspeople are similar to those of Wu County. The leisured class spends its days in teahouses, engaging in idle talk and calligraphy, which is not considered strange. The resources for their livelihood mostly rely on the rice rent from tenant farmers during the autumn harvest. They are often meticulous in extracting every penny from the farmers, but are never stingy when it comes to their personal consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and gambling. The year before last, due to the war, the collection of land rent was suspended, causing the middle class to be constantly worried. Their lives were not as lavish as before. Last winter, the puppet organizations of Wu and Kunshan counties implemented a system of jointly collecting rent and taxes. The local tyrants in the town then devised a plan to collect rent, but the farmers in the surrounding villages ignored it and refused to pay the land rent. Therefore, although the puppet tax collection office has been established for a month, it has been deserted. There is a Zhu Wenxiong in the town, who is currently the secretary of Chen Zemin, the puppet provincial governor. The local tyrants of the town then nominated representatives to consult with Zhu, agreeing to secretly report to the Japanese army in Suzhou, falsely claiming that there were many guerrillas in Chen Mu and that troops should be sent to the town to suppress them. Consequently, a team was dispatched to the town. After arriving in the town for several days, the town elites immediately used the power of the Japanese army to establish a Land Industry Commerce Office to unify the opinions of the owners and dispatched several rent collectors to the nearby villages, claiming to the farmers that the Japanese army had come to the town to supervise farming because the farmers were resisting rent, and that they would be arrested if they delayed further. The farmers, unaware of their deceit, had no choice but to submit to their exploitation. However, these local tyrants not only suppressed the farmers to their heart's content, but even managed to exploit the Japanese army.

### Wenzhou and Taizhou Fishing Boats Tragically Capsized; Over Three Thousand Fishermen Perish in a Sudden Gale While Fishing in the Ocean off Pishan, Yuhuan

A Wenzhou dispatch: Recently, fishermen from Wenzhou and Taizhou, taking advantage of the approaching winter fishing season, have been flocking to the ocean off the eastern corner of Pishan in Yuhuan County and the waters around Hongshan Yang in Wenling, Taizhou, to fish for hairtail. There were an estimated 800 fishing boats. On the evening of the 4th of this month, the weather suddenly turned cold, and a sudden northeast gale arose. The ignorant fishermen could hardly foresee the changes in the universe. Even the few fishermen who were experienced in fishing at sea knew that, in the vast ocean where the water and sky met, there was no way to escape. As a result, it is reported that over 400 fishing boats capsized in the gale. With an average of eight fishermen per boat, it is estimated that over 3,000 people tragically drowned.

### The Thriving Interprovincial Trade Between Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi: The Mutual Exchange of Goods Promotes Circulation

A Fuzhou dispatch: Interprovincial trade between Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces has gradually developed after the efforts of the authorities of the four provinces to promote it. For example, slab sugar from southern Fujian is transported to Jiangxi, and local tobacco from western Fujian is transported to Guangdong, both of which are extremely popular. The distribution of Fujian salt to Jiangxi and Guangdong is also considered to be in short supply. Recently, Jiangxi Province had a very good autumn harvest last year, with a surplus of grain. Due to the lack of salt, the Interprovincial Trade Committee sent personnel to Fujian to discuss exchanging Jiangxi rice for Fujian salt. Currently, the prices of sugar and salt in Fujian Province are gradually increasing. The price of sugar has risen from five or six yuan per dan to eight or nine yuan, and the price of salt has risen from seven or eight yuan per dan to twelve or thirteen yuan, which is a clear indication of smooth sales. Daily necessities in various counties in western Fujian are transported from Chaozhou and Shantou, which keeps prices stable and prevents them from becoming too expensive, thus affecting the livelihoods of ordinary people. The reason for this is that transportation between Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, whether direct or indirect, is very convenient, allowing for the mutual exchange of goods and promoting circulation. The three regions of southern Jiangxi, eastern Guangdong, and western Fujian are further strengthening their ties. In addition to the direct remittance implemented by the branch offices of the local banks of the three provinces in the border counties, with a remittance fee of only five cents per hundred yuan, the banknotes issued by the three banks can also be used interchangeably to promote financial circulation. In addition, the administrative commissioners of the border areas of the three provinces have each sent representatives to formulate mutual market measures. Any industrial or commercial business that is lacking in a certain province is welcome to operate in the neighboring province, and will be given preferential treatment and protection. For example, Ningdu, Yudu, Junmen, Xunwu, Huichang, and other counties in the Eighth Administrative District of southern Jiangxi extremely welcome businesses dealing in hardware, printing, salt, cloth, paper, etc. to operate there. In addition to absolute security, they can also help with hiring boats, arranging transportation, and renting houses and purchasing land. Merchants who are willing to go can submit their applications to the local county government, which will forward them to the respective county governments in Jiangxi Province for coordination.

### Japanese Troops in Changshu Occupy Luyuan and Forcibly Collect Transit Taxes in Changyinsha and Other Places

A Changshu dispatch: In mid-December last year, four or five hundred Japanese troops and puppet pacification forces surrounded the guerrillas in the western countryside of Changshu in two groups. The Advance Army and Loyalty Army in the area retreated west together to avoid frontal sacrifices. The Japanese and puppet troops then stationed themselves in the Qian family house in Luyuan Town, sending personnel to various towns to make absurd propaganda and recruiting local ruffians to encourage the establishment of rent collection stations to collect land taxes for the puppet organization. In Luyuan, Qian Xianwu, who had studied in Japan, was running around for this purpose. In Shazhou, there was no indication yet, but there were also shameless people secretly carrying out the work. Qian Yongli, the chief of the Fourth District, hid in the countryside when the Japanese troops arrived. Later, he was found by the Japanese troops and forced to serve as the head of the self-defense force. Eleven Weir Harbor in Changyinsha is the entry and exit point for goods from the inland to Shanghai. Seeing the potential for profit, the Japanese troops sent eighty or ninety people with dozens of machine guns to station themselves in the house of Geng Jianmin in Eleven Weir Harbor. The weather has been severely cold these days, and the Japanese troops, afraid of the cold, took the tables, chairs, and other items from Geng's house to use as firewood, burning them all to ashes. Even the bamboo garden behind the house was completely cut down for firewood. Currently, the Japanese troops send personnel to collect transit taxes at the port every day, causing merchants to hesitate to move forward. The Japanese forcibly use military scrip in Eleven Weir Harbor, causing hardship for the merchants. The merchants then nominated representatives to negotiate with the Japanese, agreeing to provide the Japanese with firewood, rice, oil, and vegetables daily in exchange for not using military scrip. The Japanese have agreed to their request. Since the Japanese troops occupied Luyuan, bandits have been rampant in the western countryside, and the villagers are uneasy day and night. Zhang Jianliu, a wealthy household in Shazhou who is usually very enthusiastic about local affairs, was also kidnapped by bandits. They demanded 50,000 yuan as ransom before leaving. Negotiations are still ongoing.

### Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Football Tournament - Invitation to Shanghai Team to Participate in Hong Kong Tournament - Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Tournament Stalled - Shanghai Team Will Not Go South for Triangular Tournament

(Hong Kong Dispatch) Due to the impact of the war, this year's Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Tournament has been virtually stalled. The Hong Kong Football Association has instead invited the Philippine Manila team to Hong Kong to hold the Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Football Tournament. After discussions between the organizers of both sides, it was decided to hold three consecutive days of competitions during the Lunar New Year (i.e., February 19, 20, and 21 of the Gregorian calendar). On the first day, the Hong Kong team will play against the Philippine team. On the second day, the Chinese team will play against the Philippine representative team. On the third day, the Navy and Army joint team will play against the Philippine representative team. The association convened a subcommittee a few days ago and decided to formally send an invitation, which is expected to materialize. The Philippine side also intends to invite the Shanghai team to Hong Kong to hold a triangular interport tournament to increase interest. However, according to the association's observation, this year's Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Tournament has reached a stalemate because both sides are unwilling to send teams for long journeys. Therefore, the Shanghai team has also decided not to send a team to participate in the triangular tournament. (According to news from Western football clubs in this city, they have not received a formal invitation from the Philippines regarding the triangular interport. Moreover, this year's interport tournament coincides with the visit of the [illegible] team to Shanghai, so the Shanghai team will not send a team to Hong Kong, etc.)

### Finance - European Instability Affects First-Class Currencies and Foreign Exchange - Settlement of Foreign Firm Accounts Still Flourishing - Process Eventually Changes from Tight to Loose

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw continued settlement of accounts by foreign firms and Asia Texaco, etc. The process was initially tight, but later, due to rumors of disagreements in the Anglo-American negotiations on French colonies and an increasing European crisis, coupled with persistent power outages in Hong Kong, the situation immediately changed from tight to loose. As a result, both British and American currencies turned loose again.

Early in the morning, London's long-term exchange rate was close to long-term parity, New York silver prices remained unchanged, London gold fell by half a point, the British exchange rate against the US remained unchanged, against the French increased by three points, against Shanghai decreased by 125, the US against the British increased by 25, against the French increased by 0.0625, against Shanghai decreased by a small 1.25 points. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened early, with the selling price of British exchange at 8.375 points and US exchange at 16.325 yuan, unchanged from the previous close for British exchange and up 0.09375 for US exchange. After opening, settlement of accounts by oil and foreign firms continued to be strong, coupled with an inadequate supply from banks, leading to tightness. HSBC's listed exchange rate remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax increased by 25 points. Oil and foreign firms began to buy up, with British gold softening to only 8.34375 points and US exchange to 16.25 yuan, tight to the point of interbank trading prices. Subsequently, power outages in Hong Kong occurred frequently, and money changers also dumped Hong Kong exchange rates. Moreover, banks' buying appetite was weak, so the process suddenly turned loose, with Hong Kong exchange also loosening to 56.375 yuan. At the noon close, British gold was even harder at 8.375 points and US exchange at 16.3125 yuan.

Later market: British negotiations had differing opinions, causing a decline in morale, coupled with persistent power outages in Hong Kong and a poor buying appetite from banks, while the willingness to supply increased. Therefore, although foreign firms, etc., had some settlement of accounts, the position was ultimately oversupplied, so the situation was extremely loose. US exchange hardened to the point of being difficult to sell at 10.4375 yuan, requiring 6.5 yuan. British gold was readily available from banks at 8.4375 points. After entering the market, money changers continued to dump Hong Kong exchange rates, and banks' buying appetite remained poor, so the process also hardened to 56.5 yuan. At the evening close, banks' selling price for British exchange was 8.4375 points and US exchange was 16.4375 yuan, trending looser than the noon close. As a result, British exchange was 0.0625 harder and US exchange 2.1875 longer than the previous close. The record of daily trading is listed below: (British Exchange) (Calculated in National Currency 1 Yuan)

(US Exchange) (Calculated in National Currency 100 Yuan)

### British-Italian Negotiations Unsuccessful - Cash Gray Market Suddenly Plummets Again - Breaking Below the 2,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the cash raw gold gray market situation declined again, with the trend being flat first and then falling. Although a certain money changer aggressively entered the market on behalf of colleagues in the morning, a large number of bulls from a certain gold company emerged. Therefore, the supply and demand quantities of both sides were evenly matched, and the foreign exchange rate was also flat, so there was little change, and it hovered outside the 2,000 yuan mark. Later, due to foreign news that British-Italian negotiations were difficult to compromise due to Britain's tough attitude, and that the European crisis would increase from now on, etc., the foreign exchange rate was first agitated, and the gold price fell sharply due to the dumping in Hong Kong. Cash gold companies in the market bought and then released, and jewelry stores also started selling, and chips were abundant, causing the price to fall sharply, immediately breaking below the 2,000 yuan mark, and retreating to a closing price of 1,995 yuan, the lowest price. Morale on all sides was flat first and then tired, and jewelry gold also fell by one yuan. Medium and British pure gold, etc., continued to decline slightly.

Raw Gold Drops Ten Yuan

From the morning, each tael (ten taels) initially had few buyers, and it was not until 10:05 that a certain money changer entered 50 taels each from cash gold companies and colleagues, with an opening price of 2,002.5 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange rate softened slightly, and the price also rose slightly. Another money changer and jewelry store each entered 50 taels, priced at 0.04 yuan, and securities companies also entered 50 taels, priced at 0.05 yuan, all supplied and sold by a certain gold company. The gold company then sold 100 taels to a certain money changer, priced at 0.03 yuan. After absorbing, the money changer re-entered 50 taels from jewelry stores at the same price (reportedly all on behalf of colleagues), jewelry stores entered 50 taels from money changers, priced at 0.02 yuan, and gold companies entered 20 taels from money changers, priced at 0.04 yuan. At about 11:15, the gold company's father entered 50 taels from money changers again, at 0.05 yuan, as the noon closing price. Around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, rumors of disappointing results from the British-Italian meeting were suddenly heard in the market, morale suddenly weakened, and the price also immediately declined. First, money changers traded 50 taels with each other, with an opening price of 2,000 yuan. Before long, a certain foreign bank suddenly aggressively entered the market from a certain money changer's outlet, so the price temporarily repeated its rise. A certain money changer entered 50 taels from colleagues, priced at 0.03 yuan, and certain gold companies and jewelry stores frequently dumped, and entered 50 taels from gold companies again, priced at 0.02 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange rate was reported to be hard, so buyers were all wary, and the price broke into the 2,000 yuan mark. The gold company sold 50 taels to money changers again, priced at 2,000 yuan, and jewelry stores sold 50 taels to money changers, priced at 1,998 yuan. Finally, at 4:20, jewelry stores traded 50 taels with each other, at 1,995 yuan, as the evening closing price, a decrease of ten yuan compared to the previous day. The selling price of the cash gold company's own gold was 2,005 yuan, and the purchase price was 1,990 yuan. The current spot gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no trading.

Jewelry Gold Listed Down One Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael initially did not change, until 2:37 PM, when raw gold broke into the 2,000 yuan mark, so it was also listed down one yuan. Datongxing and Lao Qingyun, etc., changed to 203 yuan, and Xin Tonghang suspended 201 yuan, with a purchase price of 195 yuan.

Pure Gold Fluctuates Little Daily

London, December 12th. The fluctuation of British pure gold is small, as the public is waiting for the outcome of the British-Italian meeting. Each ounce continued to shrink by half a point, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 9 and a half points. The Central Bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold also fell to 1,214.6 yuan. The listed customs gold remained unchanged, calculated at 2 yuan, 4 jiao, 0.01 li. The Shanghai standard spot gold price also decreased by 4 jiao, calculated at 1,209.9 jiao.

### Foreign Currency Drops Back

Yesterday, British pure gold continued to fall by half a point, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 25. Foreign exchange settlement was strong, and Japanese banks and speculators were eager to absorb, but the supply was weak and the momentum was very soft. In the afternoon, there was a slight outflow of foreign news, and the market price eased. Raw gold was initially stable, and trading was not strong. Later, rumors of a loose foreign exchange rate spread, and jewelry stores, gold companies, etc., started a trend of dumping, and the situation was soft. After the close, it was heard that the British-Italian prime ministerial negotiations had no results, people were panicked, and the calling price was even lower, and the momentum was very soft. Spot trading of foreign currency was weak, the price was high and firm, but due to the easing of exchange rates, and the impact of the raw gold drop, the trend was weak, and most market prices showed a decline. Public association transactions were very rare, only Xin Tai sold 20 pounds of British gold, and Cheng Tai took it in. Yesterday's market price saw British gold pounds fall by one jiao, British gold notes fall by 1.8 jiao, US dollar notes fall by 0.55 fen, Hong Kong notes fall by 0.01 yuan, French franc notes fall by 0.015 li, Singapore notes fall by 0.02 yuan, Dutch guilder notes fall by 0.025 yuan, Rupee notes fall by 0.01 yuan, Canadian dollar notes fall by 0.03 yuan, Philippine peso notes fall by 0.02 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Demand for Cash Turns Eager - Discount Rate Rises Another Three Yuan

Yesterday's exchange and bill discount rate continued to rise, initially stable at around 32 yuan per thousand yuan, but then suddenly soared as demand for cash became urgent, reaching 35.25 yuan, before retreating to 34.75 yuan at noon, trending similarly in the afternoon, ultimately rising three yuan higher than the previous day.

### Indian Silver Both Spot and Futures Rise

London, December 12th. With Indian buying and speculators engaging in both buying and selling, the silver market was still flat, and remained stable after the close. Buyers bought at the listed price, but sellers had to increase by 0.0625. The nearby futures of large silver bars rose by 0.0625, while the distant futures remained flat. New York silver telegram: American silver prices were still illiquid. Bombay silver telegram: The Indian silver market situation was unpredictable, with spot and nearby futures both rising by three annas, and distant futures rising by one anna.

### Securities - Location of Interest Payment Becomes a Mystery - Bond Market Feels Quite Uneasy - The Intention of Changing to "Chongqing Interest Payment" Has Two Rumored Explanations - The Shanghai Market Hopes that the Bond Market Is Prospering and Should Not Be Hit

Yesterday's security gray market turned soft again, with market prices falling and rising erratically, indicating that people's minds were in a trance. The trading also became cleaner, with many parties watching, resulting in a lack of stability. The so-called saying that this period's interest will be paid in Chongqing was initially thought to be a rumor, so the market price rebounded the day before yesterday. Yesterday's market news said that the Chongqing interest payment was indeed due to a reason, but the banks, because it was related to their lifeline and the public debt market had been striving for prosperity since the end of the year, should not be hit at this time, so they kept it secret and continued to strive for official approval to pay interest in Shanghai as before. Therefore, people in the market were skeptical and unable to be released. Although there was a saying that it could be collected in Chongqing through the Shanghai Bank, the bond market was still difficult to stabilize before the official clarification and statement of payment in Shanghai. It was said that the reason for changing the interest payment to Chongqing was to prevent large amounts of cash from flowing into the occupied areas as much as possible, and secondly, to use this fund to develop the southwest and increase anti-Japanese strength. The rumors were varied and inconclusive. Yesterday's public debt market was still firm at the beginning of the market, with retail investors absorbing types C and D most strongly, so the market price was higher than the previous day. Following this, the No. 64 public debt was sold to the market, and the market price slowly fell, resulting in a weaker performance than the previous day. In the afternoon market, morale was therefore depressed, although retail investors still had the remaining capacity to absorb, but because Tongkang still had many bulls emerging, it fell by another three or four jiao. The full-day result was a small decrease of 0.1 to 0.5 jiao, with a total turnover of about 300,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Stock trading still showed no improvement, with only more than 30 shares of China One Trust Company being traded, priced at 9.1 yuan.

London, December 12 (Thursday). The listed market prices of Chinese foreign debts continued to weaken, with the Crispe Debt falling by another pound, with a new low price of 35 pounds. The British-issued debt notes of the Rehabilitation Debt also fell back by one pound, returning to the original price of 52 pounds on the 10th. The German-issued and printed debt notes of the Hubei-Guangdong Railway Debt also continued to fall by one pound, with a new low price of 20 pounds. The Guangdong-Kowloon Railway Debt fell by half a pound, with a price of 18.5 pounds. Although the supply of real goods was lacking, the buying appetite was quite weak, with a total of 5,000 pounds being eaten for British and German continued loans, with an asking price of 76 pounds and 5 shillings, raising the market slightly by 5 shillings. 2,500 pounds of German-issued and printed debt notes of the Rehabilitation Debt were bought, with an asking price of 47 pounds, and another 2,500 pounds of debt notes were also needed, with an asking price of 46 pounds, a slight decrease of 5 shillings compared to the previous day. The British-issued debt notes of the Rehabilitation Debt are currently priced at 51.5 pounds, 0.5 pounds lower than the listed price. The French-issued and printed debt notes are priced at 47 pounds.

### Grain - Flour Demand Still Most Prosperous in Southeast Asia - Today, More Than 10,000 Bags to Be Transported

Yesterday's spot flour trading was still not lonely, as retail sales to customer groups have been quite strong recently, with both northern and southern groups active, and the Ningbo group also inquiring slightly. Southeast Asian groups' needs were the most prosperous. The Tianjin group, which pushed the big groups' sales in the market, temporarily had no intention of batching in due to the abundance of foreign flour in the local area, and the factory also indicated a high price due to insufficient production. However, buyers valued the eating plate, and the market did not easily expand upward. As a result, the city's total transactions of various brands of No. 2 flour amounted to more than 30,000 bags, of which 8,000 bags were sold in small batches in this street, and the rest were taken away by the north-south customer groups. The market was apparently stable but secretly firm.

Today, 1,500 bags of flour will be exported to Tianjin, 6,000 bags to Yantai, 3,000 bags to Weihaiwei, 1,000 bags to Fuzhou, and 2,700 bags will be shipped from Hong Kong and transferred to Yantai.

### Yangtze River Shipping Is Controlled - Wheat Source Is Difficult to Access - Newly Arrived Wuhu Wheat Is Unwelcome - More Than 10,000 Bags Transported to Ningbo Yesterday

Yesterday's wheat sources were still not abundant, as shipping in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was entirely monopolized by Japanese merchants, and it was feared that it would be difficult to surge in the short term. Only 1,400 bags arrived from Xin'gang Penglai. It was found that a portion of the newly arrived Wuhu wheat was damp and unwelcome by the manufacturers. The sellers of high-quality goods insisted on a high price, so the factory's buying appetite was also not very high. The total market sold 6,000 bags of wheat from Jiangbei, Puzhen, and Wuhu, etc., half of which were taken by the Shanfu and Xinfeng factories. The highest price was still 6.7 yuan. The market trend was firm and stable. Yesterday's exports totaled more than 11,200 bags to Ningbo.

Also, today 1,000 bags of bran will be transported to Yantai, 2,000 bags to Shantou, and 860 bags of soybeans will be transported to Shantou and 1,200 bags to Hong Kong.

### Japonica Rice Arrives Less, Market Is Good

Yesterday's source of national rice was said to be due to the wind blocking the port, so both wheel and sail goods arriving at the port were scarce, with a total of only 4,000 bags from five boats in Hexia, loaded from Hupu, including wheel buns. Therefore, morale turned firm, sellers worked hard, and sales in this street also turned active, with hoarding households all taking action, and the price changed from weak to tight. However, as a result, the price of each commodity did not see much rise or fall. If only the middle section of thick and thin japonica rice had fallen thoroughly except for the high-grade ones which lacked Ronghou, it was slightly better. Du Yangjian and Bujian. Goods were scarce and slightly straightened out. Although the change of Yuan's destination was still acceptable, there were still hoarding households rushing to sell, resulting in the price only holding the original plate. Yinyuan was also out of stock and without a market.

### Customer Indica Rice Continues to Be Slashed

Customer indica rice has been arriving continuously in recent days, and Wuhu indica rice has been arriving in Shanghai every day, but as customer hoarding has seen two dull periods and Japanese merchants have not inquired for a long time, relying only on this street, the number of transactions has been decreasing day by day. Yesterday's transactions were only several hundred bags. The specially high-quality goods can still stand at the original price, but the general market goods below that have continued to see a small number of discounts.

Today's exports still include 17,000 bags of rice from Hong Kong to Tianjin, and another 1,500 bags to Yantai.

### Yarn and Cotton - Transactions of White Bales of Cotton Still Prosperous - Deep Fear of Extinction of Sources - Cotton Companies Change to Selling Foreign Cotton

The native cotton business still has no major development, and transactions of white bales of cotton are already more prosperous than in the past. The factory only entered 1,000 piculs of Xinyu cotton, and the Shenxin Factory entered 203 pieces of Tianjin fine velvet, and there was very little other vitality. The Japanese factory has wholesale American and Indian cotton arriving in Shanghai and being sent to the factory, and has completely stopped handling Chinese cotton. The selling price is not much different from the previous day. As for the transactions among colleagues, they are still quite substantial, and they are also white bales of cotton, which are mostly transferred to Japanese factories for head衬 transactions. The cotton market has no ability to advance, but in this chaotic state, there is no fixed standard. In short, in this dead-and-alive environment, it is difficult to rise greatly. The source of northern Jiangsu is improving day by day, with 1,521 bales of Tong cotton arriving, 420 bales from Changyinsha, 320 pieces from Beisha, and 460 pieces from Xin'gang. The volume of spot cotton transactions and market prices are listed below:

Foreign cotton market prices: American cotton, due to the smooth progress of the British-Italian Rome conference and the proposed appropriation of special funds by President Roosevelt to enrich national defense, people's hearts were extremely excited. In recent days, the supply of New York spot chips has been quite scarce. Because cloth sales are strong, factories' buying appetites are also healthy. Indian groups are still dragging in distant futures in New York, and spot merchants are dragging and buying near-term contracts on the market. As a result, New York rose by 5 to 8 pounds. Due to the sharp increase in exports in recent days, India rose yesterday, along with predictions, by a total of 2 Robies. Egyptian cotton rose by more than 30 pounds yesterday. Yesterday, the exchange rate was tight again, and the legal tender cotton prices all rose, with American and Brazilian cotton each rising by more than one yuan per dan, Indian cotton rising by 1.2 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rising by more than 3 yuan per dan.

Foreign cotton transactions in this city have been particularly hot in recent days, as the short-fiber cotton factory uses the fire machine to process Yao cotton. Recently, the fine yarn of over 32 counts has not been seen to be strong, so transactions of Brazilian cotton, etc., are still rare. Yesterday, the Huachang side, Shenxin, again ordered 1,500 bales of Indian Pingguoer Xin cotton, with a limited price of 61.5 yuan delivered to the factory. Yesterday, the Bombay return telegram did not arrive, but the price was already very close, differing by only 3 or 4 jiao, and it can generally be said that the transaction will have no problems. Because the Indian cotton price of each dan rose by more than 1 yuan yesterday, other Hua factories temporarily held a wait-and-see attitude. If the Indian cotton can fall back by a small 2 or 3 yuan, the factories will place large orders. Because the source has been cut off and native cotton is about to run out, each cotton company has been discussing methods with cotton traders in order to maintain operations and plans to sell foreign cotton in the future. The number of transactions and spot prices for yesterday are listed below. Yesterday's number of transactions:

Shenxin entered 500 bales of Indian cotton

Yongan entered 300 bales of Brazilian cotton

Tongxing entered 500 bales of Indian cotton

New China entered 300 bales of Indian cotton

Gongda entered 500 bales of Indian cotton

Shanghai entered 300 bales of American cotton

The market price of foreign cotton converted into Taiwan dollars is listed below

### Differing Views Between Bulls and Bears Result in Fierce Fluctuations in Yarn Prices; Japanese Yarn Declines Steadily

The yarn market began to rise, but whether it will turn around is still uncertain. The upward trend has entered a state of flux. However, most in the industry are bullish due to the lack of inventory pressure from factories, the difficulties in sourcing cotton due to monopolization, and the relatively easier credit conditions. On the other hand, some veteran bulls believe that sales are not as robust as before and that previous bulk purchases need to be digested before business can rebound. They prefer to sell off inventory at market prices rather than hold onto it, with the intention of buying back in at a slightly lower price. This divergence of views between bulls and bears has led to significant fluctuations in market prices. However, Japanese yarn feels increasingly sluggish due to limited sales channels. Domestic merchants show little interest in trading in Chinese yarn. The future of the yarn market is temporarily stuck in a state of stagnation.

According to a market survey, the market started bullish this morning because major players had absorbed a large quantity of warehouse receipts the previous day, making the market feel tighter. Although actual demand is less than before, sporadic transactions from Yunnan, Zhejiang, Dongyang, Ningbo, and Wenzhou continued. Consequently, opening prices surged upwards, rising by four yuan. 20-count Double Horse yarn was priced at 393 yuan. As sales picked up slightly, the price rose another 1.5 yuan to 394.5 yuan. Unexpectedly, with prices rising sharply (up 12.5 yuan from the low price on the 11th), some smaller players took profits, and some parties suddenly dumped inventory, causing prices to fall rapidly by three to four yuan. Double Horse warehouse receipts fell by 6.5 yuan. However, a certain yarn company continued to buy, causing prices to rebound slightly. As a result, total transactions for the morning amounted to 1,175 bales, compared to 270 bales in the afternoon of the previous day, for a total of 1,445 bales. Prices for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 2 yuan, Extra Jin Cheng rose by 4 yuan, Double Globe rose by 1.5 yuan, and Angel rose by 1 yuan. 16-count and 10-count coarse yarns remained stable. Yong An Factory offered 30 bales of 20-count Extra Jin Cheng yarn at 400 yuan. Yesterday, 270 pieces were shipped to Ningbo, and today, 250 pieces are being shipped to Shantou, 50 pieces to Hong Kong, and 220 pieces to Tianjin. The quantities purchased by various groups are as follows:

Fellow Traders 765 Yunnan 245

Wenzhou 140 Shantou 155

Domestic 70 Ningbo 49

Quanzhou 10 Fuzhou 15

Tianjin 40 Total 1445

Japanese yarn continues to be sluggish, with weak real demand. This is due to the implementation of exchange controls in the North, which has severely impacted trading. Consequently, market prices are steadily declining. Currently, 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn has not been traded. Only this month's price is 307.70 yuan, down by 4 yuan. 20-count Water Moon spot price is 311 yuan, down from 313 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Chinese Factories Accepting Custom Orders, Unable to Focus on Grey Cloth; Sichuan and Yunnan Handle Fine Yarn Fabrics

National Cloth

Sales of white cloth are slightly better, the market is quiet but firm. Hand-made fine cloth and twill are sold off in small quantities, still about a dime cheaper than the general market. However, as most Chinese factories are busy fulfilling custom orders, they are unable to focus on grey cloth. As a result, the supply of white cloth in the market has noticeably decreased. Furthermore, transactions involving coarse cloth have been contracted, leading to tighter market sentiment and higher factory prices. The market for coarse cloth and coarse twill remains firm and stable. Sichuan and Yunnan are seeing movement in fine yarn fabrics, poplin, foreign yarn bleached cloth, and spring season goods. Over 100 boxes of plain strip poplin from Huayang, Huafeng, and Hongzhang factories have been traded. Demand for February and March futures from wholesalers on this street is extremely high due to the sharp rise in 42-count and 60-count fine yarns. Current prices are 6 dimes higher per bolt than the initial batch. Yarn and thread, serge, and woolen cloth from various factories have mostly stopped production, resulting in thin inventories and rising prices of 1-2 dimes. Dyed cloth and dyed twill have risen by 1 dime. Sales to Quanzhou, Shantou, Ou, and Ningbo continue to be strong. Funing merchants are also adding over 2,000 bolts of dyed cloth, dyed twill, serge, and broadcloth. Yunnan merchants are adding over 3,000 bolts of bleached cloth, satin, poplin, blue cloth, and our twill.

Eastern Cloth

The market is in a state of fluctuation, with ups and downs of about five cents. The results are almost identical to the previous day, as the market is extraordinarily tight and many traders are taking profits. As such, the market prices are still cheaper than the firm prices, attracting buying interest on this street. Green cloth sales are particularly active. Furthermore, the national cloth market is rising, reaching as high as one yuan per bolt. Most traders are optimistic. A major wholesaler on this street is exclusively sourcing over 400 pieces of hand-made fine cloth and twill in the market. Other dyehouses and wholesalers are purchasing over 500 pieces, making the future market particularly firm.

Exports

Yesterday, 870 pieces of cloth were exported to Ningbo. Today's exports include 60 pieces to Fuzhou, 80 pieces to Shantou, 150 pieces to Weihaiwei, 800 pieces to Yantai, and 400 pieces to Tianjin.

### North-South Goods: Dried Longan Meat Rises by Another Two Yuan

Due to scarce supply and rising production costs of dried sun-dried longan meat from Xiamen, vendors who have been holding high-quality branded goods have remained firm in their prices. As a result, prices have risen by another two yuan. It's open to question whether the prices can continue to be high. However, after investigating the market conditions, the firm prices have not fully passed to the market. Some vendors are still selling at the original prices. However, with increased cost of goods, the market will surely rise.

### Oilseed Cakes: Soybean Oil Rebounds

Yesterday's Dalian soybean oil market saw a rebound in both futures and spot prices. Spot oil rose from 27.30 yuan to 27.60 yuan. January forward oil initially fell but then rose, up five cents from the previous day. February was not traded as foreign firms showed no intention to sell. Buyers still showed interest at the previous day's price of 27.50 yuan, but sellers held back due to tighter conditions in Dalian, finding the margins unprofitable, resulting in a stalemate. Currently, the overall situation is one of insufficient supply. Although some short-sighted speculators are eager to sell, strong real demand results in more gains than losses. Peanut oil is typically scarce during this winter season, and in these extraordinary times, it feels even more so. Furthermore, the sesame oil market and export channels are also strong. Therefore, the market outlook remains optimistic. Yesterday, approximately 800 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded at a base price of 20.10 yuan, with delivery in two to three days at 30.70 yuan.

### Hardware: Blue Lead and Iron Definitely Being Exported: Over 100 Tons

Yesterday's hardware transactions remained lackluster, likely due to the approaching Lunar New Year. Fortunately, tighter foreign exchange rates helped prices hold steady. However, export orders are showing considerable development. Items such as white lead wire, yellow steel wire, blue lead iron, Wysi iron, tinplate, and black pig iron heads are being traded. Blue lead iron is definitely being exported in large quantities. The following is a record of the exported goods:

### Silk and Tea: Silk Prices Follow Overseas Trends

Yesterday's silk market saw more gains than losses overseas. Lyon and Shanghai silk each rose by one franc, Yokohama spot prices rose by 2.5 yuan, futures rose by one yuan, New York nearby months rose by 1.5 cents, and distant months fell by half a cent. Local market sentiment has turned strong again. Furthermore, foreign firms are ordering nearby month goods, while Shanghai factories have already sold off their February futures. Therefore, 78-grade white silk from factories could not be sold, while 81-grade and Golden Leopard grade spot goods saw transactions from Sin Pao and Tat Cheong. Other French firm transactions were also active, with prices trending firmer. A total of 70 piculs were traded. The Indo-Chinese firm bought ten piculs of reeled silk at an average price, but improvements are expected.

### Samsung Overcoating Wool is Exceedingly Expensive

The wool market remains robust. So much so that non-Western goods from Yuan Zhuang, Vero wool are referred to by many in the trade as Samsung overcoating wool. This is because each yard of fabric has three gold stars on the edge. Prices for these goods were depressed last month due to overstocking in the market. However, recent brisk sales have brought the price of the original boxes to four yuan and two dimes and a half per yard. Individual loose colors of non-snuff boxes are offered for 4.50 or 4.60 yuan. Retailers who cut and sell the fabrics from their stores are selling them from 4.80 up to 5 yuan per yard. (Initially, this good was only sold for 3.60 yuan at the lowest, with 4 yuan as the usual price.)

### Fruits: Shipments of Oranges from Shantou and Xiamen Continue to Arrive

Shipments of oranges from Xiamen continue to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, over 7,700 pieces arrived. 370 pieces of oranges from Shantou also arrived in Shanghai.

### Shanghai Special: Buddhism and Shanghai (Continued) (Yesterday)

—Zhi Feng

(II) Past Shanghai Buddhism and Future Prospects

Since the opening of Shanghai as a commercial port, it has become the center of culture and economy for all of China. Although it has fallen to the status of an isolated island today, it has not lost its centrality. Therefore, discussing the trends of Chinese Buddhism today, Shanghai Buddhism remains in an extremely important position.

According to historical records, Buddhism in Shanghai originated in the Three Kingdoms period when the Indian monk Kang Senghui gained the trust of the Wu Emperor Sun Quan by seeking relics, and built pagodas and temples. The Longhua Pagoda Temple and Jing'an Temple of today were the fountainhead of Buddhism in Jiangnan. Subsequently, the prosperity and decline of pagodas and temples, and the purity and impurity of monks, were nothing more than the changes of the times, and the overall trend of Buddhism either advanced or retreated. As Shanghai formed into China's only and largest commercial port, all of China's original culture, politics, economy, etc., changed with the demands of various external invasions, oppressions and internal changes. Every factor had an important relationship with Shanghai, and almost all of the motivation originated in Shanghai. Buddhist pioneers with foresight and vision, grieved over the invasion of foreign religions, the rampant anti-Buddhist sentiment of the new schools, and the internal decline of the monks, and felt that without self-strengthening, there would be no way to survive today. Therefore, since the Republic of China, Monk Zongyang, who had participated in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's national revolution, founded Huayan University in Aili Garden. This was the beginning of Buddhist education after the restoration. He also promoted the Pinqie Tripitaka and worked hard to promote Buddhist culture. Mr. and Mrs. Hardoon, the owners of Aili Garden, were powerful Dharma protectors at that time. Unfortunately, it was a flash in the pan, and Huayan University closed down before long. When Yuan was about to proclaim himself emperor, Japan used 21 articles to oppress China, which contained the freedom for Japanese Buddhism to spread Buddhism in China. Monk Bajitou Tuo Jichan of Tiantong Temple, thinking of resisting it, gathered Chinese monks, laymen, celebrities, and notables from all walks of life to establish the China Buddhist Association in Shanghai, published the Buddhist Series and the Buddhist Monthly, advocating Buddhist solidarity and national salvation, as well as studying Buddhist teachings. Li Duanfu and Monk Taixu successively edited it, and the trend of thought gradually turned to the promotion of reform. Di Pingzi, the owner of Shibao Hall, and Layman Pu Yicheng, etc., often published articles on Buddhist thought, and Youzheng Bookstore attached and circulated Buddhist scriptures. However, they were all limited by the times. The initial creations were frustrated, and they soon fell apart. Only the Buddhist magazine Jueshe Series, which Monk Taixu initially founded and published in Shanghai, was later renamed Haichao Yin, and has had an 18-year history. Its influence on the new academic circles is enormous, and it is rare to see such persistence. The true lay Buddhist group in Shanghai began to take shape in the Buddhist Pure Karma Society on Aiwenyi Road, and then moved to Nanyuan, Jian's Zhaonan, which is today's Jueyuan Pure Karma Society, hosted by Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, Shi Shengzhi, and other laymen. The Society has a Buddhist audio radio station for the purpose of spreading Buddhism, and a Dharma Treasure Hall, donated by Mr. Ye Yufu, which houses many preserved scriptures and statues. Standing side by side with the Pure Karma Society is the World Buddhist Laymen's Forest, which is also large in scale. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by artillery fire in the August 13th War. The leaders are the two monks Yin Guang and Dixian. During the 17th year of the Republic of China, the trend of destroying Buddhist statues and expelling monks and nuns became popular everywhere. Therefore, the Chinese Buddhist Association was established in Shanghai, and Monk Yuanying was elected as the chairman. Hongsan, Ke Duan, Dapei, Yuanchen, Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, Guan Jiongzhi and Huang Hanzhi were elected as standing directors. This was the beginning of a unified organization for monks and nuns throughout China. Although there were differences in internal thought and faction, and the outside world was unable to obtain substantial protection, it was quite successful in protecting religious property. After August 13th, the Association launched and organized a monastic rescue team to work on the front lines, and its work was commendable and praised by the world. It then organized a burial team to bury dead bodies in the suburbs of Shanghai, the number of which was very large.

Looking at Shanghai Buddhism since the Republic of China, although it has made no special contributions, it has made foreigners know that there is Buddhism in China, and it has allowed them to view the rituals of Buddhism to remove their contempt, which has been helpful.

It has always been said that the natural function of general religions "is to reconcile the poverty of human material life and to vigorously expand the spirit of self-improvement," while the essence of Buddhism is great wisdom and great compassion, and it is the only new religion to which the spirit of all mankind will turn in the future. If it is allowed to decline naturally, it will not only bring shame to Chinese Buddhism, but also make all mankind tremble with fear in the midst of bloody storms. Although Shanghai is in a special situation today, it has not lost its international importance. If the power of thousands of Buddhists is gathered to seek revitalization, and to uplift the spirit of the country and abroad, it will have a profound meaning. Self-reliance is the unified goal of the Chinese nation's revival today, and Buddhists should also seek the way of self-reliance to suit the Chinese nation's revival today. Therefore, my outlook for Shanghai Buddhism in the future: First, strive to understand the essential truth of Buddhism. The most important point here is that the monks should vigorously promote the true vehicle of Buddhism, and it is important to strive to cultivate talents who can promote Buddhism. The presence of fake Buddhism, with its almost dead spirit, cannot but be blamed on the lack of effort of the monks. Second, dispel the social misunderstanding of Buddhism. This is actually a cause-and-effect relationship with the above item. The true face of Buddhism has been obscured for a long time, and the so-called "transformation into polytheistic fetish superstitious Buddhism" has a long history. Most people in the general public regard Buddhism as ghosts and wonders, which is enough to represent society's erroneous understanding of Buddhism. Such bizarre novels and dramas as The Investiture of the Gods, Journey to the West, and Burning the Red Temple, make the Buddhism in the minds of the public either supernatural monsters or wicked thieves. Therefore, the advanced youth and shallow scholars of society deeply hate and abhor Buddhism. This kind of vicious influence is a serious threat. Therefore, I deeply hope that all the monks and lay Buddhists in Shanghai will work hard to improve the propaganda, wash away this great humiliation, present the true spirit of Buddhism to the whole society, and sound the minds of the society and the public. Shanghai is located in the center of China's culture and economy, and the hub of transportation between China and foreign countries, and its effect is greater than any other. Those with a heart, let us work together! (End)

### Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau Telegram: Refuse to Affix Counterfeit Stamps; Uphold Patriotic Sincerity to Maintain National Taxes

The Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau of the National Government's Ministry of Finance yesterday telegraphed the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating, "According to the Ministry of Finance's letter, it was reported that the counterfeit Jiangsu Province Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Office has printed counterfeit stamp tax tickets and plans to force merchants to purchase and affix them in Jiangsu Province and the war zone outside Shanghai starting on January 1. The counterfeit announcement has been posted everywhere. Therefore, it is ordered that the director of the bureau find ways to suppress the situation and report it. In addition to notifying all subordinate branches to pay attention to suppressing the situation, you are requested to investigate and inform all merchants to uphold patriotic sincerity and refuse to affix the counterfeit stamps in order to maintain national taxes.

### The Government Handles National Construction Savings; You Can Save Starting from One Yuan; The Government Guarantees Principal and Interest

In order to encourage national thrift savings and promote national construction, the National Government has promulgated the National Construction Savings Regulations to promote national construction and provide generous interest on national construction savings. The use of the savings is limited to investment in production enterprises. The details are as follows:

Receiving Agencies

The national construction savings are collected by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau. In addition to being directly responsible to the depositors by the receiving banks and bureaus, the government guarantees the safety of its principal and interest. The same applies to other public and private banks that have been approved by the Ministry of Finance to collect national construction savings. The national construction savings shall be at least one yuan in national currency, and depositors may deposit it at any time. However, the principal can only be withdrawn after three years from the date of deposit. The banks and postal savings and remittances bureaus that collect national construction savings shall give interest that is more preferential than ordinary savings, and shall manage it as an independent fund and shall not mix it with the profits and losses of the general business of the banks and bureaus. When opening national construction savings, each bank and bureau shall formulate rules and regulations in accordance with the regulations and submit them to the Ministry of Finance for approval.

Investment Standards

The use of national construction savings collected by various banks and postal savings and remittances bureaus is limited to investment in the following industries: 1. Production industries related to national defense; 2. Reclaiming land, building water conservancy projects, and developing agriculture and animal husbandry; 3. Developing industry and mining; 4. Transportation industry; 5. Joint production and sales industry; 6. Other economic construction industries. The investment in each of the aforementioned industries shall be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The shares obtained from the investment in the industry shall be the first guarantee preparation for the national savings.

Special Savings

National construction savings can be saved in foreign currencies, and the principal and interest will still be paid in foreign currencies after maturity. Those who save with gold and silver shall also add a handling fee in accordance with the supplementary measures of the Ministry of Finance's exchange of legal tender and the method of exchanging gold for legal tender, and calculate the national construction savings deposit according to the principal. When a security deposit is required for official business, it can be used as a substitute. The banks and postal savings and remittances bureaus that collect national construction savings and their investments shall prepare a balance sheet and a property list every six months and report them to the Ministry of Finance for inspection. Banks and postal savings and remittances bureaus that handle national construction savings may issue national construction savings gift certificates, but they shall first submit them to the Ministry of Finance for approval.

### Fundraising for the Relief of Refugees in the Two Guangdongs; Guangdong People in Shanghai Launched a Fundraising Campaign Starting on the 15th

During the recent military operations in South China, the people in the war zones in the two Guangdongs suffered heavy casualties. Guangdong people in Shanghai, Feng Bingnan, Guo Shun, Guo Zhongliang, Cai Chang, Chen Qihao, Cui Pingxi, He Quansheng, Li Ze, Chen Qifen, Fang Yusheng, and others, in order to relieve the suffering of their fellow villagers, invited enthusiastic fellow villagers to organize the "Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Villagers Relief Fundraising Committee for the Refugees in the Two Guangdongs." It was officially established on the 13th of last month, and Guangdong people in Shanghai participated enthusiastically. At 2:00 p.m. on January 15th, a plenary committee meeting was held at the Datong Restaurant. Guo Shun, the deputy committee director, prepared refreshments and invited all committee members to attend and encourage the progress. Starting from that day, donation books were issued and distributed to the committee members to raise funds. It is expected that there will be no shortage of sympathetic people from all walks of life, and the future results will be considerable.

### Concerns About the Export of Rice Grain Collected and Transported from Wuhu; Japanese Side Is Smuggling a Significant Amount; Customs Is Preparing to Take Measures to Stop It; The Situation in the Mainland Is Unstable, and Shanghai Merchants Are Reducing Collection and Transportation

The transportation and sales of rice grain in this city is related to the food supply of the residents of the concession. The two concession authorities have implemented control measures in an invisible way, and the customs is also following the central government's order to restrict exports. Therefore, various groups in the north and south have changed to purchasing from Wuhu and then exporting. The Japanese side is also smuggling and loading goods without paying taxes. Recently, due to the increasingly serious situation in the mainland, Shanghai companies have reduced their orders and the market is actively reorganizing internal management measures. The details are as follows:

Export of Rice Grain Transported from Wuhu

Due to strict restrictions imposed by the concession authorities and customs on rice grain exports from Shanghai to various ports in the north and south, such as Tianjin, Yantai, Weihaiwei, Xiamen, and Shantou, the procedures are cumbersome, and the number of permits issued each month is very small. Therefore, merchants from various ports have raised funds themselves to purchase from Wuhu, Jiujiang, and other places, and load them onto the Changjiang Qian each ship of the Nissin Company to transport them to Shanghai. After arriving at Wusong, they are directly exported. Currently, the price of rice in Wuhu has been continuously raised since the competition for purchases from various ports. Each stone of white xian rice is priced at six yuan and 12 cents. Moreover, the local area uses a dry hu, which is about five to six sheng more per stone when calculated according to the market hu. It has been decided that the Japanese side will directly collect rice grain from the production area and transport it to Shanghai. The number of ships smuggled each week is quite large. The customs authorities are planning to take appropriate measures to stop it.

Unrest in the Mainland Reduces Collection and Transportation

Since the New Year, there have been occasional wars in the north and south of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Pirates have also taken the opportunity to rob ships. Most of the companies in this city that originally purchased rice grain directly from Jingjiang, Jiangyin, Changshu, Wuxi, Kunshan, and other places have stopped purchasing and transporting due to the unstable situation in the mainland, the delay in land and water travel due to dry rivers and shallow water, and the frequent occurrence of robbery and other incidents. Therefore, the amount of rice grain arriving in Shanghai recently is only five to six thousand bags per day, which is more than twice as much as before the New Year. As for the transporters, because the price of rice grain in the mainland has risen sharply, the profit from transporting it to Shanghai is minimal, and they dare not purchase large quantities to avoid danger.

Ample Grain Reserves Stabilize the Rice Market

According to a recent survey of rice reserves in Shanghai over the past week, there are actually about 700,000 bags. In addition to being piled up in various warehouses, the number of reserves in the market is still one to two thousand bags, and even small rice shops have three to four hundred bags. The Modern News Agency reporter investigated the market yesterday and found that the daily market transactions are six to seven thousand bags, and the market price fluctuates very little.

Strict Management Implemented in the Market

The Rice Industry Market Management Committee has repeatedly taken steps to improve management methods in order to crack down on brokers who are not in the same industry and restrict adulteration by transporters. The market will reissue entry permits with the applicant's photo on January 3 of this year to prevent substitution. The rules and regulations for the buying and selling aspects have also been announced so that both the brokers and the buyers can comply. All the two-cent donations deducted from the buyer by the merchants are used for the operating expenses of various organizations such as the Bean Rice and Vegetable Association, the Changshu Rice Industry Association, the Shanghai North Rice Transportation Merchants Association, and the South Gang Association, and have nothing to do with the market.

### Reduced Shipments on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line Reduced Freight Charges; Reduced Combined Transport; Plotting for Fuhang and Ende to Sail to Ningbo; An Na Postponed Departure

After the Zhejiang Provincial authorities approved the addition of Fuhang and other ships to the Shanghai-Ningbo line, the water freight has been reduced, making cargo transportation more convenient. Combined transport of goods on the Shanghai-Taiwan-Ningbo line has been sharply reduced. Fuhang and Ende have already started sailing to Ningbo, but the new An Na has postponed its departure. The details are as follows:

Sharp Reduction in Cargo Combined Transport on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line

Since the Ningbo authorities implemented a blockade on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, cargo transportation was still convenient because the Shanghai-Taiwan line also had ships going to Wan Ningbo, such as Tang Sai and Mei Da. Later, Tang Sai and Mei Da were also prohibited from sailing from Shanghai, and direct ships between Shanghai and Ningbo were suspended. Therefore, in order to facilitate the passengers, the two shipping authorities agreed that Tang Bei, Ha Na, Hai Fu, Shan Tai, and other ships would carry out combined transport, with Haimen as the transshipment center. Since the implementation, the passengers have found it convenient, and cargo transportation has been crowded. Now that the number of special cargo ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo line has increased, and the water freight has been reduced to half, all the goods between Shanghai and Ningbo have been transferred to special ships for transportation in order to avoid the trouble of loading and unloading midway. As a result, combined transport of goods has been sharply reduced. Now, Tang Sai, Mei Da, Shan Tai, Ha Na, and other ships are mostly carrying goods between Shanghai and Taiwan or between Ningbo and Taiwan.

New An Na Delayed Departure

The new An Na, chartered by the American Wiley Han Company, was approved to sail to Ningbo via Taizhou. The company announced that it would sail to Taiwan on the 13th. However, according to inquiries, the ship did not depart yesterday. According to the ship's crew, some procedures have not been completed, and the departure may be postponed until today or tomorrow. The two ships, Fuhang and Ende, have already sailed to Wenzhou and transferred to Ningbo yesterday, carrying quite a lot of daily necessities such as cloth. (Modern News Agency)

### Rescue News: Fuxin Owner Donates Cotton Clothing, Chen Yuruo Adopts Refugees

The Citizens' Fundraising Committee approved a letter yesterday from Zhou Bangjun stating that Ding Houqing, owner of Fuxin Tobacco Company, and his son Yuquan, generously donated 600 national currency units to sew 200 sets of cotton clothing for refugees, specifying that 50 sets be transferred to the Fuxin-affiliated refugee shelter.

Chen Yuruo, of the Taigu Shuntian Steamship Company, donated 200 national currency units, originally intended as New Year's gifts for relatives and children, to the Refugee Assistance Association Citizens' Group to fund refugee adoption. The association issued a receipt. Mr. Chen also obtained eight refugee adoption certificates from the association and continues to solicit donations to support this good cause.

### Su Security Brigade Arrives in Jiading, Captures and Executes Puppet Officials, Mobilizes the People to Resist Japan

According to news from Jiading, the Infantry Regiment of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Brigade has arrived in Jiading, led by Regiment Commander □□□. They have repeatedly engaged in guerrilla warfare with other friendly forces. The Third War Zone Commander has also appointed the □ Regiment Commander as concurrently the head of the Jiading Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps, mobilizing the people to armed resistance against Japan. Recently, the regiment captured Gao Chongshan, a member of the Jiading puppet maintenance committee, and Zhang Liansheng, a puppet official. With the approval of the Third War Zone Command, they were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad the day before yesterday, greatly pleasing the people. Furthermore, Xu Jiaqi, the county magistrate of the Jiading war zone, resigned due to illness, which has been approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Cai Xiren, the Commissioner of the Third District, has been appointed to act concurrently.

### One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement Promoted in Guerrilla Areas, Managed by Military and Government Organs, People Everywhere Eager to Donate

Since the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement was initiated by various circles in this city, it has been widely promoted in various places. It is now also being implemented in guerrilla areas, managed by the local Huajun (Chinese army) and administrative organs, starting from January 1st of this year. The levies are: an additional value of one percent of the goods tax, for those cultivating more than five acres of land,

### Principal and Interest of Public Bonds to Be Paid in Chongqing, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Bank of Communications Can Collect on Behalf

In order to maintain the credit of national bonds, the Ministry of Finance, despite heavy military expenditures during this period of resistance, has been able to allocate funds for the principal and interest of bonds on schedule, without delay. The redemption and interest payment for the five types of national bonds, namely, A, B, Inner, D, and E, which are due at the end of this month, totaling 51,283,100 yuan, have been decided to be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted institutions upon maturity. Regarding the widespread rumors in the financial market that the principal and interest of public bonds will be paid by the Chongqing Central Bank headquarters, but the branches of the Bank of China, Communications Bank, and the Bank of Communications can collect on their behalf, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with the banking industry yesterday. However, the financial community believes that payment of interest in Chongqing is likely to become a reality. At the routine meeting of the Bankers' Association (Thursday) the day before yesterday, a committee member raised the matter for discussion, but as no order had been received from the Ministry of Finance, it was only discussed and no decision was made. As of last night, the Bank of China, Communications Bank, and the Bank of Communications had not yet received an order from the Ministry of Finance to make payments in Chongqing, but it is heard that payment in Chongqing will certainly become a reality in the future. Once detailed measures and orders arrive in Shanghai, the Central Bank will announce their implementation. It is expected that this order will arrive before the end of this month. Furthermore, the reporter met with Secretary-General Lin of the Bankers' Association yesterday, who said that the rumors in the Shanghai financial market about changing the payment of principal and interest of public bonds to Chongqing have not been confirmed due to the lack of an order from the Ministry. If it becomes a reality, it does not mean that the payment of principal and interest of public bonds will be delayed, as Shanghai and Chongqing payments are only minor issues of procedure and timing. The tenants and landlords each bear 50 cents, a tax of one percent is levied on passenger tickets for steamships, and there are free donations. It is now learned that although the people everywhere are living in difficult circumstances, they have been subjected to enemy oppression and their patriotic enthusiasm is unwavering, and they are willing to save on food and clothing and donate enthusiastically. The donations are sent in batches by the presiding organs to Shanghai to be deposited in banks and remitted to Chongqing.

### 30,000 Russian Émigrés Celebrate the New Year in Shanghai

The Continental Daily reports that over 30,000 White Russian immigrants in Shanghai will be celebrating the Russian New Year tonight (the 13th), which falls 13 days later than the Gregorian calendar. Some foreign nationals in the city are also celebrating the Russian New Year, so some bars and nightclubs not run by White Russians are preparing special dishes and decorations tonight. The Old Russian Army and Navy Veterans Association will hold its annual dance at the French Ball Club tonight. The Russian Club on Avenue Foch and the White Russians in the Hongshan District will also hold dances tonight.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Approves Gas Price Increase, Levies 23% Surcharge, Effective February 15th

In January of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Council notified gas users that it had approved the Shanghai Gas Company to temporarily charge a 15% surcharge. This surcharge was increased to 18% from August of last year. In November, the company stated to the Municipal Council that the 18% surcharge was insufficient to cover operating expenses and a reasonable dividend, and requested the Municipal Council to approve a further increase in the surcharge, with the percentage determined monthly based on the exchange rate between the Chinese national currency and the British pound.

The Director of the Finance Department of the Municipal Council carefully reviewed the company's accounts and budget for the year, and considered that the request for a further increase in the surcharge was justified due to the increased price of coal and other materials required for operation, and the cost of living allowances already received by the company's employees. However, he did not approve of the method of changing the surcharge amount monthly. The Director therefore suggested increasing the surcharge to 23% for a trial period of three months.

After reviewing the gas company's petition and the Finance Director's opinion, the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council decided to recommend to the Board of Directors that the company be allowed to collect a 23% surcharge based on the amount of gas used, as shown on the gas meter, from February 1st or later of this year until April 30th of this year. Before this measure is implemented, the surcharge remains at 18%. The recommendation was approved by the Board of Directors, but the company stated that it wanted to continue to consider it and did not accept it immediately. As the company has now agreed, the Board of Directors' approved measure can be implemented, but because the price increase must be notified to users one month in advance, the date of the start of the price increase has been changed to February 15th of this year. The surcharge before this date remains at 18%. This matter will be reviewed before April 30th, and all related matters will be considered at that time.

### French Securities Company Not an Exchange

Reports indicate that some French businessmen in Shanghai have recently joined with Chinese to establish a real estate securities investment company. It is now heard that the company is a privately owned company and not a company similar to an exchange, because in an exchange company, the public can freely buy and sell various securities, which is different from the nature of the company.

### Whole Batch of Smuggled Taiwanese Sugar Floods the Market, Japanese Newspapers and News Agencies Openly Admit It, Smuggled Goods Are All Called Military Supplies

The Continental Daily reports that the Japanese-language newspaper Continental News in Shanghai openly admitted a few days ago that a large amount of Taiwanese sugar was smuggled into Shanghai in whole batches. The Allied News Agency in this city did not clearly understand the seriousness of its relationship and widely publicized it. Newspapers in this city publish its news without comment. To understand the importance of the Continental News' admission, it must be known that according to the Shanghai External Trade Monthly Statistics published by the Chinese Customs, up to October 1938, no Taiwanese sugar was exported to Shanghai through Shanghai Customs. The import of Taiwanese sugar in November was only worth 2.040 Customs Gold Units, which was less than 1/200th of the total value of sugar imported into this city. Knowing this, the news about Taiwanese sugar released by the Allied News Agency must be read with careful attention. The news says that, according to the Continental News, Taiwanese sugar ranks first among the sugar imported into this city and shows signs of monopolizing the Shanghai market. The dumping of Taiwanese sugar in Shanghai is increasing greatly. There was indeed no Taiwanese sugar exported to Shanghai until the outbreak of this war, but in 1938, one million dan were exported to Shanghai, an increase of ten times compared with the year before the Shanghai sugar market was almost monopolized. Because Taiwanese sugar is cheap and freight is light, Taiwanese sugar has a great advantage in competing with Javanese sugar. There is no doubt that the market in this city is flooded with Japanese sugar, and there is no doubt that the Japanese have accurate news about how much Taiwanese sugar is imported. The Allied News Agency's transcription of the news from the Continental News is also undoubtedly true, but by reading the Customs statistics, you can pay attention to one fact, that is, the import of Taiwanese sugar has not been registered by Customs. The only explanation is that Taiwanese sugar is smuggled into Shanghai. At the beginning of last year, powerful Taiwanese sugar merchants, after lobbying the Nanjing puppet regime, immediately began to openly smuggle large amounts of Taiwanese sugar into Shanghai and other parts of China from Taiwan. According to the Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement, the Japanese must stop all smuggling in China, hand over their imports to Customs for inspection, and pay customs duties. However, the Japanese are now continuing to engage in large-scale smuggling and always call these goods that are not imported by Customs "military supplies". Taiwanese sugar cannot be called military supplies. From the news intercepted by the Continental News, it can be seen that these imports are undoubtedly large-scale commercial transactions. It is a rare mistake for a Japanese newspaper to openly admit such a blatant event of smuggling Japanese goods and violating international obligations.

### Punan and Coastal Areas Reek of Poison, Initially Operating in Secret, Now Openly Doing Business

Opium, morphine, white powder, and heroin are everywhere in Punan and coastal areas, almost becoming a drug-infested area. The ronin and hooligans who sell drugs initially operated in secret, but now they openly do business without restraint. Inside No. 33, Dongchang Road, Dongchang Lane, there is another major drug den, run by two Korean ronin. Usually, the main door is tightly closed, with a small hole opened on the door and a lead wire bell installed outside the door. When someone goes to buy drugs in bulk, they only need to pull the lead wire according to the law. When the bell rings inside the drug den, someone will stick their head out of the small hole and ask how much they want to buy. If it is a retail purchase, the transaction is done at the hole. If they want to buy in bulk, they will open the back door to let people in. If the quantity purchased is large, the drug den will be responsible for delivering it on land in Pudong, but it is not responsible in the Huangpu River.

### Movements of British Military Officers

The Shanghai Times reports that Squadron Leader Aitken, who succeeded Air Commodore Cooper as Air Attaché at the British Embassy in Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai with his wife on Sunday (the 8th) and is staying at the Cathay Hotel. According to reports, Mr. Cooper has been in Shanghai for almost three years and is scheduled to return to England with his wife on the 24th of this month.

The Continental Daily reports that Major General Gressett, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in China, is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Tianjin on the British ship HMS Grimsby this morning (the 13th) and will inspect the British garrison in Tianjin and Beijing.

### Norwegian Envoy Leaves Shanghai, New Consul General Arrives Tomorrow

Norwegian Envoy to China, Gøran, has stayed in Shanghai for two weeks, entertained by the local Norwegian business community. He is reportedly scheduled to depart for his post in Tokyo on the Tienshien Company's vessel "Tung-on" tomorrow morning (the 14th).

The newly appointed Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires and Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Knudtzon, will arrive in Shanghai on the Italian mail ship Victoria on the 15th of this month. Mr. Knudtzon served at the consulate in Shanghai twenty years ago, and his most recent post was in the capital of Romania, so this decision is a return to familiar ground.

### Situation Still Tense in Southern Pudong, Ferry Services Suspended Again, Rumors Rampant in the Area, Land Route Inspections Extremely Troublesome

The situation in Southern Pudong remains very tense. Rumors are rampant in the area, and security measures have been tightened. Residents are frequently relocating. Ferry services from the concession to Southern Pudong, except for the ferries at Desheng Port, Yangsi Bridge, Lutang, and Temple Dock, which have been sealed off and have not yet reopened, have recently resumed at Wangjiadu, Dujiahang, Zha Port, Tangkou, and Guan Port. However, as of the 13th, they were suspended again. Traveling to Pudong by land is also difficult due to troublesome inspections. Residents are reluctant to proceed. The ferry services at Bailianjing and Liulibqiao on the south Huangpu River have also been suspended, and the situation is still very chaotic, so they have not been restored.

### Sealing of Puppet "Police Station" Not Protested by Puppet "Government," Even if Protested, British Troops Would Ignore It, Content of Puppet "Mayor's" Note Unclear

The Continental Daily reports that as of late last night (the 12th), the British authorities in Shanghai had not received a protest from the puppet "Reformed Government" regarding the sealing of the puppet police station on Avenue du President Doumer. However, it is generally believed that even if the puppet government in Nanjing lodges such a protest, the British authorities will ignore it. It is also heard that the British Consul General in Shanghai has received a note from the puppet "Mayor of Shanghai," Chuan Xiaowan, but its nature has not yet been revealed.

### Shanghai Post Office to Accept Airmail to Chongqing and Guizhou, China National Aviation Corporation Flights Have Been Flying Twice Daily Since the 10th

China National Aviation Corporation has increased the number of flights to Chongqing and Guizhou, flying twice daily since the 10th of this month. Therefore, the Shanghai Postal Administration has decided to start accepting airmail for this route within the next few days. The Business and General Affairs Office will issue a notice to inform senders.

### Postal Remittance Bureau Develops Drafts, Strives for Swift Procedures, Remittances Congested at End of Lunar Year, Additional Personnel Dispatched to Assist

The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, in view of the approaching end of the Lunar Year and the fact that people traveling in Shanghai from various places are remitting money in large numbers, resulting in a sudden increase in business, has dispatched additional personnel to assist in processing remittances and added windows to avoid congestion. The bureau has also notified the public that when coming to the bureau to remit money, they must first fill out the draft application form in detail and then submit the remittance and application form together through the window for the developer to receive. Do not place them randomly, otherwise, if there is any loss, the remitter will be responsible and the bureau will not be liable. As for the daily office hours, except for holidays, it is from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. It is also learned that the post office has started accepting small parcels to Ningbo and Shaoxing yesterday. The limit is still 30 kilograms per item, and the fee is 15 cents per kilogram.

### Xingsheng Relief Society Distributes Clothing and Bedding

The north wind is piercing, and the skin is freezing. The refugees who are camping on the streets and those who are living in refugee shelters lack cotton clothing and are pitifully shivering. If you are not in their situation, how can you know the sadness of freezing and starvation? There are also those who collapse on the roadside due to hunger and cold. The Xingsheng Street Relief Society brought a large amount of old clothing and bedding to the refugee areas for distribution, and people from all walks of life are donating clothing and bedding to the society to help the refugees. The society distributes the items collected on the same day to the areas the next morning, and the work is quite serious. (The society has been distributing food rice to the refugees in the refugee areas every three days, and thousands of people have been relying on it for more than a year.) The society breaks the long-standing prejudices of charitable organizations. Regardless of whether they live in the concession, the winter clothes for relatives and friends in the refugee areas, no matter who they are designated to give to, are all transferred and distributed to the area. The spirit of not distinguishing between regions is commendable.

### Italian Commercial Counselor Returns to Shanghai

The North-China Daily News reports that Italian Commercial Counselor in Shanghai, Ancirone, returned to Shanghai from South China on the 12th.

### Financial Situation More Stable This Year, Developing the Economy of the Rear Area, International Balance of Payments Situation Further Improves, Funds Flow into the Interior to Assist in Development

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the national financial front has always been stable. After a long period of testing and overcoming numerous difficulties, public and private financial organizations have become more complete. The people's trust is increasing day by day. Now, they are determined to use all their strength to develop the economy of the rear area, so that funds flow into the interior to assist in development. The details are recorded as follows:

Financial Situation More Relaxed This Year

The Bank of China, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank, and Farmers Bank have established joint offices and discount committees in major cities where they have branches to engage in the discounting and mortgage lending of agricultural, industrial, and commercial bills. This lending method is partly commercial mortgage lending, and with the regulations on re-pledging and discounting, it also has the function of the central bank regulating finance. The current amount of lending is 100 million yuan. Since its implementation, the national financial situation has been exceptionally stable. There were no deposit runs or credit squeezes or financial panics last year. At the beginning of this year, the financial situation became more relaxed, so the discount committee stopped direct lending. When there is a need, the Bankers' Association will apply on its behalf.

Efforts to Develop the Economy of the Rear Area

In order to develop the economy of the rear area, the government is encouraging production enterprises to move to the interior and is also striving to promote the circulation of local finance. Local financial institutions can obtain one-yuan notes and subsidiary currency notes from the Bank of China, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank, and Farmers Bank to support production enterprises in the interior. The intention is to encourage financial institutions to invest in agriculture, industry, and mining to correct the mistake of the past emphasis on urban finance. Now it is decided to encourage exports, facilitate remittances from overseas Chinese, find ways to collect gold and silver, increase the number of local financial institutions, promote savings movements, encourage various productions, increase agricultural loans, provide credit loans, and train financial personnel. The above items have all been implemented one after another.

Issue Policy Especially Cautious

My country's legal tender policy was successful before the war, and its credit has increased through the war. The legal tender cash reserve has always been above 60%, and the guarantee reserve has been below 40%. All checks have met the statutory ratio. As for the total amount issued, at the end of the Republic of China in 1937, it was 1,639,098,000 yuan. In June 1938, it increased to 1,826,998,000 yuan. The rate of increase is not as fast as in the early stage of reform. From December 1935 to December 1936, the total amount issued increased by 568,979,000 yuan, while in the first half of 1938, the increase was only 87.9 million yuan, which is enough to prove the prudence of its issuance.

Encourage the Flow of Internal Funds

After the war, funds flowed into cities, and with the regulation of public and private financial institutions, funds became more abundant. Last year, interest rates remained unchanged throughout the year. The discount rate of the Shanghai Money Dealers Association even fell to 11 cents at the end of the year. Although the opportunity to use funds during the war has decreased, it is also one of the reasons why interest rates are constant and tending to fall. However, on the other hand, it is also a performance of financial stability and people's stability, and it is also a powerful proof of the constant value of the currency. However, the government is doing its best to make its funds flow into the interior in order to develop the economy of the rear area and enrich national strength, so it encourages the internal migration of banks. For example, there are already more than 320 general branches of banks in the six provinces of Southwest China.

International Balance of Payments Further Trending Towards Smoothness

After the Trade Commission made every effort to adjust my country's international trade, it actually turned into a trade surplus in June, July, August, and September of last year. In the long run, in the first eleven months of 1937, the trade deficit was 117,750,125 yuan, while in the same period of 1938, the trade deficit was 111,101,442 yuan, which is enough to prove the success of my country's controlled trade. The increase in remittances from overseas Chinese is very large. It is heard that the total amount last year reached 600 million yuan, which is double the increase compared with previous years, which is more than enough to offset the commodity trade deficit. Recently, since the success of credit loans from Britain and the United States, the inflow of foreign capital into my country's international balance of payments has further tended towards smoothness.

Consistently Maintain the Legal Exchange Rate

In order to stabilize foreign exchange, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Central Bank have consistently maintained the statutory price. Although the Japanese have repeatedly attempted to disrupt it, such as taking advantage of the joint notes to obtain foreign exchange and reduce the value of the currency in North China, all plans ultimately failed. The issuance of legal currency in North China has increased unabated, and it has the trust of the people and is still in circulation, and there is a premium. As for the exchange rate in the open market, it has always stood at eight British shillings. The general public's confidence in my country's currency has been completely restored. The difference between the near and far term exchange rates has also gradually disappeared. Many of my country's capital have withdrawn the funds they invested in foreign exchange. This is partly because they are afraid that the exchange rate will continue to rise and they will lose the opportunity to profit, and partly because there are more profitable places to invest funds than in foreign exchange.

### Xu Shiying and Sichuan Province Agree on Relief Measures for Refugees Entering Sichuan, The Elderly, Weak, and Disabled Are Properly Sheltered, Those Able to Work Are Ordered to Engage in Reclamation and Gold Panning

Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, in view of the expansion of the war zone since the resistance war and the increasing number of refugees entering Sichuan, discussed and agreed on specific relief measures with the Sichuan provincial authorities. The summary is recorded as follows:

Shelter and Settle

For refugees who are elderly, weak, disabled, or young women without the ability to work: 1. Existing relief homes in various counties and cities will be reorganized to accommodate as many as possible; 2. Various charitable organizations and institutions will find ways to accommodate them. For refugees who are able to work: 1. Refugees entering Sichuan from Eastern Sichuan will be transferred to the wilderness of Leima and Ping'e for reclamation, or to the sand gold-producing areas of Yibin and Pingshan along the Jinsha River to engage in gold panning; 2. Refugees entering Sichuan from Northern Sichuan will be transferred to the sand gold-producing areas along the Jialing River, such as Guangyuan and Bazhong, to work in gold panning or reclaim wasteland; 3. Those willing to serve in the military, those with teacher qualifications, and those with special skills will be assigned other jobs.

Reclamation and Gold Panning

### Stateless Great Swindler Induces the Opposite Sex to Defraud Wealth Relies on Social Skills to Deceive Women's Property Resides in Paramount, Owes Money and Is Arrested

There is one Motong Lorentz Baron, whose nationality is unknown, but whose appearance resembles that of an Anglo-American; he is fluent in English and has traveled to Italy, Germany, the United States and other countries. However, wherever he goes, he relies on his seductive social skills to deceive women of their property. Subsequently, he was arrested, punished, and deported by the local authorities. Since then, no place in the European and American countries could accommodate him, and he began to wander to Shanghai the year before last. However, his kind of bad habits have not been extinguished, causing many foreign women in Shanghai to suffer fraud and lose their wealth. These deceived people,

all with their reputations at stake,

did not report it at first. Later, after being discovered by the Public Concession police authorities, he was arrested. Because his nationality was unknown, he was handed over to the First Special District Local Court, where he was tried and found guilty of repeated fraud, theft, and other crimes. He was sentenced to imprisonment. After his sentence expired on the twelfth of last month, he went to the Paramount Hotel on Yu Garden Road, falsely claiming that he was an advertising merchant who had just come to Shanghai from abroad to do business. He then took an advertising contract from the basket he carried and showed it to the hotel staff to "prove his identity." As a result, he was

deceived into staying and dining, and until recently, the hotel reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station that his arrears for food and lodging had accumulated to more than 140 yuan, but he had not paid a penny. The police station sent detectives to arrest Baron. After finding out the previous situation, because he was indeed a bad element, he was transferred to the First Special Court yesterday, and Judge Dai Rongduo conducted the trial. The police lawyer Qian Xunhua described the situation, saying that such a bad egg should be severely punished. Questioned the defendant, he confessed to owing travel expenses and was willing to repay in installments without denial. The court ordered him to be detained pending a fixed date for sentencing.

### Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road, Cracks Down on Morphine Den, Confiscates Over a Hundred Packets of Morphine, Arrests Three Criminals, Two Koreans Escape Midway, One Recaptured

French police inspector Yang Gaoski (transliteration) learned yesterday that someone was privately setting up a morphine den for sale at No. 66 Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road. At about 1 p.m., he led Chinese and Western detectives to the address to search, arrested two Koreans and one Chinese, and confiscated more than a hundred packets of morphine. He took them to the French General Police Station in Lujiawan. After interrogation, he ordered the Chinese to be detained pending transfer to the court for trial. The two Koreans were to be sent to the Japanese Consulate for verification. At half past two, Chinese and Western detectives brought out the two Koreans and escorted them in a car for transfer. Unexpectedly, after getting into the car, the two Koreans took the opportunity to remove their handcuffs and jumped out of the car's left and right doors, fleeing in the east and west directions. When the detectives discovered this, they immediately blew their whistles and gave chase in different directions. As a result, the one who fled east was recaptured at the intersection of Masnan Road, while the one who fled west had disappeared. The recaptured Korean was taken back to the police station for verification. The Chinese will be sent to the Second Special Court for trial today.

Chen Qicai's Eulogy

The eulogy is as follows: "Alas, alas! How sorrowful! The way of heaven is impermanent, why are the good not spared? The deceased is ignorant, while the living are observant and bury their worries. The world is narrow and cannot be developed, mourning geese everywhere croaking. How difficult is the life of the people, depression and hunger abound. Feeling that so many people are gone, who is there to consult with? Thinking of the like-mindedness and agreement, thirty years of friendship. Grieving for the urgent difficulty of the Dove Plain, shared hatred on the sea. Ashamed of my incompetence, to be with you on the same boat. Borrowing jade from other mountains, seeking to correct mistakes. Using compassion to save the world, excelling in painting and calligraphy. Advising loyalty and filial piety, your legacy will last for centuries. In the face of changing times, the sun and moon pass quickly. You went to a remote place to avoid the world, lonely. You became a Buddha in the West, silently protecting Shenzhou. Praise and promote to influence the world, explaining the subtle and revealing the hidden. My heart is choked, the sky is vast. Alas, alas!"

### Guerrilla Captain Shot Dead by Sniper

Yang Jinhe, from Shandong, was 28 years old. During the Shanghai war, Yang served as a company commander of the Tax Police Regiment and participated in the anti-Japanese work in Zhabei. After the National Army moved west, Yang and more than ten soldiers under his command were left in the Panlong countryside in western Shanghai.

This summer, Yang recruited scattered soldiers and local patriots to organize a guerrilla team, and Yang was elected as the captain of the squadron.

### French Lawyer Viloroth Is Arrested Previously Swindled Two Million Francs in France The Reason for This Arrest Is Uncertain

The Continental Daily News reports that French lawyer Viloroth, originally from Bulgaria, was involved in several fraud cases in France two years ago, involving two million francs. He was arrested by the French authorities here ten days ago. The news of Viloroth's arrest was only revealed yesterday (12th), but the exact charges against him could not be confirmed yesterday. According to reports, Viloroth came to Shanghai two years ago and set up a law office on the fifth floor of No. 9 Edward Road, practicing law. People in Shanghai who were familiar with Viloroth only heard him say that he came from India and that his wife died in Paris a few years ago, so he traveled the world to ease his grief. Viloroth was married to a French woman in Shanghai. According to sources yesterday, Viloroth will not be tried in Shanghai, but will be sent back to France, or to the French colony closest to Shanghai, namely Vietnam, for trial by the court.

### Shipping Company Threatening Letter Handwriting Analysis Defendant Writes in Court

Xu Guansheng, from Nantong, residing at No. 73, Lane 125, Albert Road, and Wang Yigong, a local, jointly invested 50,000 yuan on November 2nd last year to organize Hengren Shipping Company at No. 125 Hankou Road, renting Changde Shipping Company's ships to travel between Shanghai and Nantong, Zhanghuang, and Xinshenggang, transporting goods and passengers. Xu was appointed as manager, Wang as assistant manager, Zhang Bingchu, a local, and Chen Zhongwen, from Jiangyin, as the main and deputy compradors, and Li Ganchen, from Jiangyin, and Chen Zhengzhi, from Nantong, as the main and deputy business managers. The ship operated until December 2nd, when the one-month contract expired. The company lost 30,000 yuan, and it was discovered that the compradors and business managers had colluded

to Cheat in Coal Purchases

and privately received commissions. Negotiations arose. Before a resolution could be reached, Chen Zhengmin (elder brother of Chen Zhengzhi, deputy business manager), from Nantong, came to Shanghai to demand private commissions and remittance advances from Hengren Shipping Company and joined the mediation without resolution. On December 20th last year, Xu Guansheng and Wang Yigong both received a threatening letter from Chen Zhengmin and others, and reported it to the French police. The police sent detectives to arrest Chen Zhengmin, Zhang Bingchu, Chen Zhongwen, Li Ganchen, Chen Zhengzhi, and other five people and transfer them to the Second Special Court for

interrogation and investigation.

Later, the French Concession administrative authorities filed a public prosecution for the threatening letter. The hearing resumed on the 8th of this month. The defendants retained Wang Shizong, Zuo De, and other lawyers for defense. The defendants were allowed to pay 2,000 yuan each as security and wait for further investigation. The situation has been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Minsheng held a court session to continue the trial. The first plaintiff, Xu Guansheng, claimed to be ill and was represented by the second plaintiff, Wang Yigong. When questioned, the defendants still denied writing the threatening letter to Xu and Wang. Witness Zhang Guohua

testified that

he was an inspector at Hengye Shipping Company. After Xu Guansheng received the threatening letter, he sent me to the Oriental Hotel to meet with Chen Zhengmin to negotiate. Chen admitted to sending the threatening letter to Xu Guansheng. Later, Ji Xiaofeng came to my house to see me and asked me to give false testimony in court, saying that the threatening letter was written by the plaintiff himself, and promised me a reward of 2,000 yuan afterwards. I refused. At the Oriental Hotel, Chen Zhengzhi admitted that he was Ji Xiaofeng's disciple, and so on. At this point, the court ordered the defendants to write numbers in court for submission. The court adjourned the hearing to the 23rd to wait for handwriting analysis before resuming the trial.

### Gambling Dens Abound in Western Shanghai Foreigners Continue to Set Up Large Gambling Houses The Roulette Game on Daxilu Is the Largest

According to foreign sources, gambling dens are rampant in the jurisdiction of the pseudo "Shanghai Municipal Government" in western Shanghai, as reported in various newspapers. It is heard that in addition to the Chinese setting up these gambling dens, foreigners are also flocking to set them up. The vanguard among the foreigners is naturally a group of White Russians. The White Russians first opened a gambling den on Daxilu. Seeing that the Chinese gambling dens were doing good "business," they also hired Chinese as employees in the gambling den to attract Chinese gamblers. Following the White Russians' establishment of gambling dens, other foreigners followed suit. The scale of the foreigners is larger. Recently, a large-scale roulette gambling den was established in a well-known club on Daxilu. The decoration cost for the den alone reached more than 20,000 yuan. Those who gamble there are mostly wealthy patrons, so the gambling den offers dinner to the gamblers, and cigarettes and alcohol are free, even champagne. The den spends thousands of yuan every night, plus another 500 yuan for so-called "charitable" donations. Although this new gambling den is located outside the jurisdiction of the Public Concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council police authorities will find ways to block all streets between the concession and the gambling den, and will set up special posts to detain anyone who enters or leaves the area after the prescribed time.

### Jinmen Grand Theater on Fuxu Road

In view of the increasing population density in western Shanghai, the Wufu Amusement Company specifically purchased a site at No. 757 Fuxu Road, near the intersection of Albert Road, and hired workers to build a magnificent and luxurious cinema, named the Jinmen Grand Theater. Construction has been underway for more than a month. According to Ma Xiangsheng, chairman of the company, the motivation for building the Jinmen Grand Theater is purely to adjust the spirit of the citizens in the western district and to provide high-quality entertainment to relieve the hard work of the day. Looking at the commercial development in the western district, it has developed rapidly. Housing is dense, and there are no modern entertainment venues to meet the demand. Therefore, major figures in the film industry have gathered to build a new type of cinema in the center of the western district to meet the needs. A well-known Xingye architect was specially hired to take charge of the project, and the design took three months to complete. The construction project was considered several times before construction began, working day and night in a very tense manner. At present, the entire project has been mostly completed. The most difficult task is the soundproof wallpaper on the walls. This structure is the first creation in the Far East. No trace of dirt can be found between the walls of the entire theater. The entire structure is embedded with soundproof wallpaper to absorb the harsh and trembling sound waves and emit soft and pleasant sounds. The wall lamps are concealed, and the bulbs are not visible. All that is seen is a patch of light, which is not tiring to look at for a long time. The seats are padded with soft wool and springs, like small sofas. Sitting in them, there is no numbness in the waist and back. The sound equipment is the latest Altec Lansing, and the vision is even more advanced. The films shown are all second-run Western films, carefully selected to suit the taste of the Chinese. In short, the goal is to allow the audience to obtain the enjoyment of a first-class cinema at the price of a second-class cinema. The opening date is scheduled for the New Year's Day of the abandoned yuan. At that time, the streets of Fuxu Road will be crowded with traffic, creating a new scene.

### New Asia Restaurant Said to Be Reopening

The Shanghai Times reports that the New Asia Restaurant on Tiantong Road has been closed since the start of the war in August of the year before last, because Chinese and foreign people all went to the area south of the Suzhou Creek. Later, it was used as the headquarters by representatives of the pseudo "Great Way Government" for a long time. After the pseudo "Great Way Government" moved to Nanjing, it was empty. The restaurant will be reopened soon and rented out to the public.

The vehicle style is currently displayed on Gordon Road. In the past two or three weeks, the rickshaw dealers who have changed to new vehicles have still not followed the improved vehicle style.

### Robbery on Xinzha Road

A family named Mou, residing at No. 36, Lane 1536, Xinzha Road, was suddenly broken into by two bandits at around 9:10 yesterday morning. All the men and women in the house were placed under the bandits' control and unable to move. One bandit went to each room to search, but there was no large amount of savings in the house, so only more than fifty yuan in banknotes were stolen before they escaped. After the victim reported the incident to the police station, detectives were dispatched to investigate and immediately gave chase.

### Gu Siyu Attacks Wang Xintang Lawyer Wang Clarifies His Heart

Lawyer Wang Zhetang, from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, graduated from Senshu University in Japan. After returning to China, he applied for a lawyer's certificate from the Ministry of Judicial Administration in the autumn of 1935. After the review committee of the Ministry verified the facts, a lawyer's certificate was issued, and he joined the Shanghai Bar Association, practicing law in Shanghai for four years. Because of his diligence and integrity, his business has been flourishing. However, recently, Gu Siyu, from Shangyu, who has had a brief acquaintance with Lawyer Wang and has repeatedly borrowed money from Lawyer Wang, has now sent letters to the various levels of courts and prosecutor's offices in this city, the Bar Association, the Legal Department of the Municipal Council, etc., alleging that Lawyer Wang's law degree was purchased on his behalf in October 1935 and that he bribed the Japanese Student Supervision Office to stamp it. Now, because Lawyer Wang is ungrateful, he has turned to reporting, etc. Lawyer Wang was extremely angry after hearing this news. He believes that he can be investigated by all parties because of his origins. Gu Siyu's actions are actually because Gu previously used the name of the "Huangdao Association" Western District Director to attempt to defraud 8,000 yuan without success. He also reported to a certain party that Lawyer Wang was a member of the Blue Shirts Society, also without success. Therefore, this decisive action is intended to slander, without a doubt. Therefore, Lawyer Wang declared the process in the newspaper, collected various evidences to prove it, and also reported to the various levels of courts and the Bar Association to clarify the facts. Gu's intimidation and fraud and deliberate defamation will also be prosecuted according to law.

### Young Woman Leaves, Lodger Found Poisoned: Dies Despite Treatment, Two Suicide Notes Found Nearby

Tang Xiaoxi, a 34-year-old man from Shaoxing, resided at 387 Foch Road. The day before yesterday (November 11th) afternoon, he and a friend checked into Room 4 of the No. 1 Hostel on Hankou Road. The hostel clerk led them to Room 35, which was to be their lodging. That evening, he and his friend went out. However, upon returning to the hostel, the friend departed separately, and a young

woman accompanied him back.

Shortly after, they closed the door and went to sleep. The next afternoon, he did not go out, but the young woman left on her own and did not return. That evening, Tang Xiaoxi stayed alone. Before going to bed, he instructed the tea server to wake him up around 2 PM the next day (November 13th). So, yesterday afternoon at around 2 PM, the tea server went to wake him up as instructed. However, he did not respond for a long time, so the server

opened the door and went inside to check.

Unexpectedly, Tang Xiaoxi's face was pale and he was unconscious. Some kind of poison was left next to his pillow. Realizing something was wrong, the server immediately reported to the police station, which dispatched a car to rush him to the hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, the poisoning was too severe, and he could not be saved. He died at around 3 PM. The hospital then reported to the police station, which sent a car to temporarily take the body to the coroner's office for examination. A search of his belongings

revealed two suicide notes.

One was addressed to his mother, but what he wrote seemed untrue. The note read, "Dear Mother, I respectfully report that I have suffered so much injustice in my elder sister's shop that I have no other choice but to borrow 110 yuan and leave. I asked a friend about going to Nanjing to seek opportunities, and he borrowed 100 yuan from me and never returned. I really wanted to see you one last time, but I

find it pointless.

So, I have decided to die. Mother, do not cry for my death. Elder brother, take care of your health at home, and do not be angry with mother. I will repay the money I borrowed from my elder sister in the next life," and so on. The other note was addressed to his friend named Qian Zihe, and only informed him of his lodging location and asked him to call his elder brother, Tang Xiaogen, at 387 Foch Road. As for the truth of the matter, it will be clear after a detailed investigation by the police. However, according to general observation, his claim about lending money to a friend is probably untrue, and the man and woman who entered and left with him may be related to this case, but this is unknown.

They then turned back. The fire burned for two hours before it was somewhat contained, but the embers and thick smoke had not completely dissipated by evening. Afterwards, according to residents of the concession in that area, the fire broke out at the Mingxing Film Company's studio in front of Fenglin Bridge.

### Letter

To Whom It May Concern: I have just read an article in your newspaper today (November 13th) about landlords forcing rent collection, which is quite different from the facts. Shuncheng Lane is located in the eastern section of Yangshupu, and most of the residents are workers. Although the area has suffered from the 813 war, factories and wharves have gradually recovered since last year. Therefore, the residents have also moved back one after another. Considering that it was just after the war, and in order to show consideration for the tenants, they have not been asked to pay the pre-war rent and new rent, which has been a year now. Recently, the number of residents in the Yangshupu area and the market conditions are no less than before the war. Most of the real estate owned by our company in the area has been rented as usual. The Shuncheng Lane side also notified the tenants to come to handle the rent payment procedures from December 1 last year. However, the tenants are mostly simple-minded and few have come to contact our company. Although our company has sent people to the area many times to persuade them to pay the rent, it has not only been ineffective, but the tenants have yelled at the dispatched staff. Our company believes that many of the residents in the area are unreasonable, so on the afternoon of the 12th, a Western employee, Hao Erjun, went with two other Chinese employees, also to persuade them to pay the rent, and to prevent accidents. Your newspaper stated that the three people, including the lane secretary and two Russian police officers and the street sweeper, mistook the three people for six people. When the tenants saw the Western employees coming, they immediately beat the gongs to gather the crowd. At that time, there were hundreds of male and female thugs, holding sticks and dirty objects (toilet buckets, brooms) and bricks, etc., swarming forward. If Hao Erjun and others had not immediately dodged, they would have almost been poisoned by them. This kind of action is obviously pre-organized and not so-called angry impulse. The forced rent collection and blocking the door mentioned in your newspaper are not true. And the tap water has been connected, and the street lights are in the process of requesting the power company to connect the fire. As for the electricity for personal use, it is not the company's responsibility to supply. Your newspaper's statement that there is no water and electricity is probably a misunderstanding. Therefore, I specially state the true facts, and send a letter to your newspaper's editorial department for your information and to publish it in the correction column. Sincerely, British Commercial Guangdi Real Estate Co., Ltd. To Whom It May Concern: I have just read your newspaper's article about the sale of counterfeit cigarettes and the news of Yue Wu trying to escape, which is obviously inconsistent with the facts. Our company has neither Xu Gu's co-workers nor the residence of a housewife. The address is south of Wuma Road, Shilu, and the door number is 69-71, so there is no reason to go to No. 157 and climb from the balcony to the Juchang Hall on Fuzhou Road. The various things mentioned are probably untrue. I hereby send a letter to you for correction. Sincerely, Changchun Guiyuan Sandalwood Company, January 13.

### Mother Spoils and Protects, Wastrel Squanders Recklessly, Steals Cotton Pad When Money Is Not Obtained, Old Father Recovers and Sends to Court, Sentenced to Four Months

He Hanzhang, a native of Shaoxing, who lives at No. 55, Lane 50, Maigen Road, West Shanghai, is already 26 years old. He relies on his septuagenarian father, Peicheng, to make a living by doing business. In addition to his parents providing him with food, clothing, and housing, he also spends extravagantly. Because his mother loves him dearly, she still tries to accommodate him.

Protecting him in every way Recently, He Peicheng sold a factory he was operating. Hanzhang knew that his father's pockets were full, and he asked for a thousand gold coins. Because his father refused to use the money of his hard work to waste for the prodigal son, he refused. Hanzhang did not think about his shame, but suddenly stole two cotton quilts from his parents the day before yesterday and carried them to No. 134 Maigen Road.

Pawnshop for a loan Peicheng learned about it and followed him out, twisting Hanzhang into the patrolman on the way and taking him to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special District Court. He Peicheng went to court and explained the bad behavior of his unfilial son and asked him to be severely punished. Judge Dai questioned him about the facts and sentenced He Hanzhang to theft and sentenced him to four months of imprisonment. The stolen goods were handed over to the original owner to take them away.

### Free Talk The Word "Again" in Japan

— Chi Huai

If we ask a Japanese typesetter which word he has used the most and the most annoying recently, he will definitely tell you that it is the word "again".

The first major event in Japan in 1939 was the "re"placement of the Japanese cabinet; the first work that the Japanese government called for in 1939 was the national "re"organization; the response of the Japanese pro-government cultural circles was the intellectual "re"construction, the theoretical "re"start; and the periodic changes in the military were also the prelude to the "re"intensification of the invasion of China.

Whether from the perspective of natural evolution or the development of human history, the word "again" can never have progressive significance. The word "again" can be used as an auxiliary word to strengthen the meaning, such as taking another step forward or taking another step back, but the meaning of the word "again" itself undoubtedly contains the meaning of decline. This is even more evident in Japan today.

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War a year and a half ago, Japan has repeatedly dispatched troops militarily, and the supreme commanders in North China and Central China have been changed three times; although the cabinet has been recently replaced, even during the Konoe cabinet, the cabinet ministers have been replaced repeatedly. For example, the important position of Foreign Minister has been changed twice, and other cabinet ministers except for the Navy Minister Yonai have been replaced again and again. A commentator was worried when he saw the government's frantic and clueless situation. He was worried that the repeated changes of military commanders would be "misinterpreted" as the failure of the war, and the changes of the heads of provinces would be "misunderstood" as changes in policies.

However, the failure of the Japanese invasion of China and the repeated setbacks in diplomatic policy have long been recognized by the world. Otherwise, there would be no need for "national re-organization," "intellectual re-transformation," "theoretical re-departure," and Touyama Mitsuru's re-hanging Konoe from the puppet shelf and taking out Hiranuma to play a play.

What exactly is the so-called "national re-organization" and other new tricks? Although the cultural people behind the gun have a lot of "theories" on this, a few words from Murofushi Takashin are the most revealing: He said: The so-called national re-organization, in principle, is for all citizens, all citizens, in short, for individualism, for things of liberalism, that is, collectivism."

The so-called "collectivism" (Totalialism) here is a synonym for fascism, a deceptive term. And the so-called "national re-organization," to put it bluntly, is to intensify the fascistization of the Japanese people, deprive the Japanese people of all their remaining freedom and individuality, for the sake of the few military fascists. The most obvious manifestation of this in politics is the emergence of the Hiranuma cabinet, which represents the mainstream Japanese fascism.

The so-called "intellectual re-construction," in Japan, which calls the war of aggression a "holy war," is tantamount to the obliteration of human conscience. Intellect is no longer considered a modern thing. Their theory is: "... intellect belongs to the modern era, while the modern era starts from criticism. To call for the defense of intellect today is to defend modernism, and therefore to violate modernity... As the intellect of totalitarianism, it has already been defeated in its own claims... Intellect is not worth defending today...". And the conclusion is that since modern intellect has "failed," it must be "re-constructed" as "modern intellect."

And the so-called "modern" here is also a deceptive term, and must not be regarded as a progressive term. The "modern intellect" that is to be re-constructed here is the beastly knowledge of fascist killing, replacing the human nature and free conscience of modern democracy. And the so-called "theoretical re-departure" is also the same deceptive trick.

Today, Japan's invasion of China is being carried out with both literature and force. In Shanghai, we may not easily feel the horror of the enemy's deceptive theories, but if we go to the interior where the enemy's iron hooves are, we can understand the viciousness of these deceptive theories. The person who uses the pen as a gun is also a division of labor here.

But from these many words of "again," we can see that Japan is re-intensifying its advance into the dark abyss. We have no schadenfreude mentality towards the people of Japan, we just hope that they can wake up in time and no longer be at the mercy of these many words of "again."

### Cold

— Yang Mou

The piercing north wind whipped the wilderness into a lifeless expanse. A withered yellow sun feebly shone through the clouds, filling everything with the bleak and cruel cold of winter!

The brothers of the Third Detachment were sunning themselves on the open ground in front of Wangjia Village. Clad only in their single uniforms, their magnificent frames shivered incessantly in the sunlight.

The detachment commander took off a sanitary shirt that local residents had just given him yesterday and handed it to the youngest member of the team.

"Are you cold? Take this and wear it."

The youngest member of the team, called Xiao Chen, saw the commander hand it over, a naive smile appearing on his face, refusing to accept it with a grin.

"Hah! What warmth can a sanitary shirt provide? Striking at the 'Red Devils' [enemy] is what really keeps you warm!"

Xiao Chen's words excited everyone, and everyone's blood boiled.

"Commander! Let's go play with the 'Red Devils', shall we?"

It was unclear which team member suggested it. They treated the "Red Devils" like a child, even a toy, always calling attacking them "playing with the Red Devils."

The commander always wore a solemn face, with a hint of a smile, and he simply shook his head.

"Be patient!"

The sun seemed to be mocking them, the brave men were just sunning themselves, but the sun had retreated back into its hole.

Although their blood was boiling, their thin uniforms ultimately could not withstand the north wind on the open plain.

A farmer ran over.

"Commander! How about inviting the brothers to warm up at my house?"

The commander nodded. So everyone filed into the low thatched hut, hunching over.

Just as everyone was beginning to feel a little warmth in the small hut, a panicked person rushed in.

"Commander! Where are you? The 'Red Devils' are setting fire to my house to warm themselves!"

"Where?"

The brave men rubbed their palms, puffed out their chests, and grabbed their weapons.

The detachment commander led the way.

"Brothers! Follow me!"

Everyone ran towards the place where thick smoke was swirling as if they were mad.

Twelve "Red Devils" were warming themselves beside the flames, still gleefully shooting at the people fleeing from the fire.

The north wind had frozen the brothers, but it made the fire even more fierce, making the "Red Devils" even warmer.

"Charge!"

To save precious bullets, the brothers charged with bayonets.

Twelve "Red Devils" seemed too few against the thirty warriors' blades.

Though cold, they still carried water to put out the fire, though they liked the fire, they tried their best to extinguish it.

The warriors triumphed.

"Fear not the cold! Do not be afraid of the cold!"

"Kill the 'Red Devils' to dispel the cold!"

Mental Hygiene: A Review of "Everyone Can Be a Yao or Shun" by Yang Fei

Mental health originates from material conditions, but in turn, influences those material conditions; this has become a widely accepted principle. Therefore, when discussing "life sustenance," we must simultaneously pay attention to both material and mental health and training.

However, some people focus too much on the material aspects and neglect the mental aspects, always worrying and guarding against everything related to diet and lifestyle, fearing they will harm their bodies. This results in them becoming "hypochondriacs," with their nerves constantly in a state of tension and confusion, leading to mental exhaustion, physical weakness, and suffering from what is called "pseudo-illness." They do not understand mental hygiene, thus allowing fear, anxiety, sadness, and the like to sneak in and harm their health.

The power of the mind naturally cannot transcend matter and take the lead, but it can often give matter a decisive reaction. This is not only a commonly seen phenomenon in experience, but also has scientific proof. Therefore, to maintain health, under the same material conditions, we must pay more attention to "mental hygiene." This naturally does not mean adopting the methods of ancient ascetics who advocated accepting circumstances as they are, not letting emotions affect them, and being detached from the physical body. Instead, it means having positive, progressive, decisive, and joyful mentalities.

If we can skillfully use and develop our mental strength, it will not only be sufficient to nurture individual life, but can also be expanded to nurture the lives of the nation, the country, and even all of humanity.

Regarding this aspect, there is a recent work based on experience and science titled "Everyone Can Be a Yao or Shun." Its original title is "Every Man a King," written by O. S. Marden, translated by Hu Shanyuan, and published by the World Book Company.

From the beginning, the author teaches us to control our thoughts to turn them towards positive applications and to control our minds to avoid misfortune and hardship. Then he explains the effect of the mind on the body. For example, even physical exercise requires interest and concentration to develop muscles; otherwise, it is of little benefit. More obviously, "emotional fluctuations have a great relationship with digestion and other physiological functions," and there is experimental evidence to prove it.

Mental states such as thoughts and emotions not only affect physical health but also affect careers. The author expands on this point, detailing the uselessness, harm, and roots of fear, emotional impulses, pessimism, and negativity, thereby teaching us to overcome them, to conquer fear, to have peace of mind, to be brave and optimistic, and to be proactive and affirmative.

Subsequently, the author points out that thoughts can influence people and create an atmosphere. He teaches us to have firm faith and self-reliance, to have bright, hopeful, loving, and upward-looking thoughts, to work hard to make up for our shortcomings, to create our noble personality, to have a rich imagination to seek transformation and progress, to always look forward and not let age weigh us down, to habitually discipline our thoughts to change our character, and to make people in the future flow with the world.

Although this is a thin little book, it is impossible to introduce its contents in a compressed way here. The author does not just utter preachy generalities; instead, he cites many poems, famous lines, and real-life experiences, chemical experiments, and medical reports to reveal the importance of mental power in explaining, encouraging, and educating readers, sufficiently enabling them to reflect on themselves and then put it into practice to improve their character, health, and even career.

Sun Yat-sen said that power arises from faith. It seems that Engels also said that one must be a materialist when understanding things, but an absolute idealist when engaged in revolutionary practice. These words all indicate the greatest role of mental strength in life.

In our country's war of resistance, it is not enough to merely analyze the conditions for certain victory. We must thoroughly eliminate all terror, anxiety, worry..., and strengthen the confidence in victory, strengthen the positive, affirmative, courageous, progressive, bright, and optimistic thoughts and emotions toward the war of resistance, and develop our highest mental strength to fight hard, and in the end, we will surely achieve victory. This is not a miracle, but an inevitable fact.

Therefore, the essence of health care mentioned here should not only be applied to individuals, but also to the nation, and in the future, we will apply it to all of humanity!

### A Wrong Path (Part 2)

— Yun Zhan

The air in the room had become extremely miserable. Er Maozi's wife stared with hopeless eyes, but without tears. Her body felt as if it had been thrown into an ice cellar, but she tried her best to hold back the trembling.

Er Maozi looked at his wife's face, terribly gloomy; a wave of sadness washed over him, and he couldn't help but let a few tears fall. For such a tough guy to shed tears was a first for his wife. Naturally, she couldn't hold back any longer. Tears like rain poured out, and she collapsed on the bed, sobbing so hard she could barely breathe.

"Alright, alright, don't cry!" He walked over, picked up his wife like a little chicken, laid her flat on the side where the child was sleeping, and covered her with the quilt. "Sleep, let me think for a while."

"Think for a while?" It drilled straight into her eardrums, a flash of light in the darkness. She sniffled and choked back her sobs.

But what he was thinking about was not the "to go or not to go question" that she expected. He thought about himself, about Liu Er, about why people in general were ending up in dead ends these days. Poverty was a gift from the enemy, he knew that; Liu Er was being forced by poverty, he also knew that. But why would someone like Master Yang, who wasn't impoverished, also take this path? If there wasn't a group like Master Yang's, would there still be a group like Liu Er's? He couldn't figure it out. He thought again about himself, about his wife, about friends and relatives other than Liu Er, and also about people like Liu Er's maternal uncle. He paced back and forth in the room, feeling more and more confused the more he thought.

It was past midnight, but he was still very agitated. He quietly walked to the edge of the bed to see that his wife's tear-filled eyes were still not closed. The child, on the other hand, was sleeping soundly, but his little face was not as plump as before, which was naturally due to his wife's insufficient breast milk. He thought of what his wife had just said, "We need to find a way to make a living. We can't just keep our eyes open and wait to starve to death," and his heart felt like it was being twisted by pliers.

His wife saw him approaching, and a glimmer of light appeared in her eyes: "What should we do? I think... I think you should still go with Brother Liu Er, if not for you and me, then think of the child!" Her voice was almost a cry.

"No, I can't!" His eyebrows rose again, and his piercing gaze revealed a surge of anger in his heart, speaking firmly but gently: "I forgive you, and I forgive Liu Er. We're really suffering too much! But precisely because I have this child, I can't let my son bear the evil name of a 'petty traitor' in the future—worse than a pig or a dog. As for myself, I won't become a traitor, but would I become a slave to traitors?" He paused, his voice softer, "If we don't go, we'll starve to death, I know that; but if we do go, I won't just hate myself, or resent myself, I'm bound to go crazy. Either way we're going to die, let's die a little cleaner! Besides, I still have some breath left in me, I still have some strength. Listen to me, don't be tempted by that stinking money! I'd rather be a beggar, begging and pleading to support you and the child!" Tears streamed down his face, and he himself felt overwhelmed with sorrow.

His wife's gloomy face was moved and brightened; they couldn't help but embrace each other tightly and sob together, forgetting the night, forgetting the time.

The wind howled, it must be almost dawn.

The little child had also woken up.

### Anglo-Italian Talks Have a Good Atmosphere

— Fo

British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax held political talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano at the Palazzo Venezia on the 10th at 6 p.m., lasting one and a half hours, with a very good impression, it is said. Assuming the four were at the Palazzo Venezia, in a study setting, playing eight rounds of mahjong, with a clean table and excellent scenery, it would be very interesting.

Although the Anglo-Italian talks were not a game of cards, the psychology of both sides was indeed no different from playing cards. Italy hoped that the player to their left, "Britain," would play a card for them to take; assuming the player to the left blocked the card, not allowing them to take it, it might still be possible for them to win with a self-drawn concealed hand. Britain not only hoped that the player to their right, "Italy," would not be able to take any cards, but also wouldn't be able to win with a self-draw, going around in circles without even getting ready to call for a win. The psychology of mahjong players is inherently one of cutthroat competition, and the psychology of political negotiations is no less cunning and narrow-minded.

Italy's goal is twofold: first, to acquire French territories in Africa, and second, to establish hegemony in the Mediterranean. Taking a side card is acceptable, as is winning with a self-drawn concealed hand, but in Britain's mind, these two cards must not be allowed to be taken. If one card is taken, they would be ready to call for a win, and once they're ready to call, they are sure to win, not just with a small hand. In their hand, they must have a large hand, absolutely not allowing you to win, otherwise you and I will lose.

Therefore, the psychology of political negotiations is about winning and losing, and the psychology of playing cards is about victory and defeat. Furthermore, when four people play cards, two people collude and communicate with each other, which is called "lifting the sedan chair." Now Chamberlain and Halifax are one team, and Mussolini and Ciano are one team, carrying the sedan chair but without anyone to sit in it, I'm afraid the two sedan chairs will inevitably be carried for nothing, and in the end, even the money for the sedan chair will not be produced.

### Talking About Envelopes

— Zhang Zhu

According to a relative who has worked at the Shanghai Postal Administration for twenty years, twenty years ago, the letters he handled, apart from those from foreigners and those printed with the logos of foreign firms, were entirely Chinese-style envelopes made of domestic paper, such as those with red labels, or those with red borders on a white background, or other various styles, accounting for about 95%. But from then until now, it has only been twenty years, and yet the letters he handles, apart from those from foreigners and those printed with the logos of foreign firms, that are entirely Chinese-style envelopes made of domestic paper, account for almost only about 20%. And within this 20%, if analyzed further, correspondence between businesses accounts for about two-fifths, correspondence between government agencies also accounts for about two-fifths, and other private letters account for one-fifth. And among these private letters using purely domestic envelopes, those from the interior are still about twice as many as those sent from Shanghai.

He also said: Apart from the 20% of the total that are purely domestic envelopes, the other 80%, those with red borders or various patterns and designs, still maintain the flavor of Chinese-style envelopes, still occupying a quarter of the position, but it is very regrettable that these envelopes are all printed on foreign paper, some using newsprint, some using "daolin" paper. In short, they are no longer printed on Chinese paper. These envelopes are mostly used by new-style businesses, government agencies, and educational institutions. The other three-quarters are Western-style envelopes made of purely foreign paper. At least about 80% of these Western-style envelopes made of foreign paper are written on with steel pens and blue ink, although what is written is still purely Chinese characters—and fortunately there are these Chinese characters, which preserve a little bit of Chinese flavor.

Finally, he said: If another ten years pass, perhaps, or to say it more certainly, Western-style envelopes made of foreign paper will inevitably occupy 100% of the position. At the very least, it will never be lower than 95%.

According to another friend who works in the stationery department of a large department store, at his workplace, at least 70,000 to 80,000 foreign envelopes are sold each year. In one year, over 110,000 were sold. Every year during Christmas and at the end of the year, 30,000 to 40,000 are sold, because this is when Christmas and New Year's cards are sent, so sales are particularly brisk. Analyzing the customers of these envelopes, foreigners account for about slightly less than 5%, and Chinese account for slightly more than 95%. If analyzed by age, those over fifty years old can be said to be less than 1%, while those under thirty or forty years old account for about 80%. At the counter where he works, although Chinese-style envelopes made of Chinese paper are also sold, less than a thousand are sold each year. Because no one cares about these Chinese envelopes, they are no longer displayed on the counter to avoid taking up space. At the same time, I also inquired at a paper shop specializing in selling paper, stationery, and envelopes. The shopkeeper, seeing me bring up this issue, said with great emotion: Ten years ago, our shop only sold Chinese envelopes (referring to Chinese envelopes made of Chinese paper), and could make 5,000 to 6,000 yuan a year, but now, being able to make 1,000 to 2,000 yuan a year is considered pretty good. But the Western envelopes of inferior quality that we sell on consignment can also make 500 to 600 yuan a year.

From the above three conversations, the trend of the general public's use of envelopes in recent years is fully expressed. Some people say that this is because the Chinese are becoming increasingly Westernized, and their level is gradually improving. Some people also say that this is because the general public's psychology of loving foreign goods is becoming increasingly developed, which is a very worrying phenomenon. Who is right and who is wrong, please let the reader judge for themselves.

Finally, I also have to report something. According to a friend who returned to China after the "August 13th" incident, in Japan, Western-style envelopes made of Japanese-produced paper have not yet taken the place of Japanese-style envelopes made of parchment. This statement is further confirmed by a relative who works at the post office. Regarding this issue, I think it may also be worth paying attention to, so I mention it here in passing.

Talking About "The Great Stage of the 20th Century" and Editor Chen Peiren by Zhu Xingu

Yesterday, I read the article "Anecdotes of Shanghai by the Master of the Han Qi Studio" in this newspaper about "The Great Stage of the 20th Century" magazine and learned that the Master of the Studio has a copy of the book. (I remember that in 1929 or 1930, when Mr. Chen Peiren was the director of the Jiangsu Revolutionary Museum and I was the editor of a monthly magazine, I had collected the book but did not obtain it.) I know a little about the magazine, so I have written it out to supplement the Master of the Studio:

Mr. Chen Zumu Jiujiu Peiren's name was Qubing, also known as Chaonan, Hao Jilou, and nicknamed Chuihong Tingzhang. He was from Zhouzhuang, Wujiang, and lived in Tongli Town. He was a renowned poet in the north and south of the Yangtze River and served as a professor at various universities. He was as famous as Mr. Liu Yazi and Ye Ji in the same town, and people called them the two gentlemen of Chen and Liu. During the reign of Emperor Guangxu and Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty, he was very active in promoting the revolution. According to Mr. Chen, he told me before his death that around 1904, he and Mr. Liu Yazi (i.e., Ya Lu in the Great Stage Magazine) and Mr. Liu Jiping (named San) and others founded the National Studies Preservation Society, the Alarm Bell Newspaper, and the Great Stage Magazine in Shanghai, but they were always in the teahouse, using the teahouse as a place for revolutionary party members to gather, because gathering in the teahouse could avoid the attention of the Manchus. Before long, the Alarm Bell Newspaper was sealed, and Mr. Chen went to Yangzhuang in Guanxingtang Township, Qingpu County (the former villa of Mr. Yang Tieya of the Yuan Dynasty) and recited poetry, which was very interesting. Therefore, in Mr. Chen's "Hao Ge Tang Poetry Collection," there are poems about Fengxi Road, Yangzhuang, Gushan, and Yushan. (I don't have the "Hao Ge Tang Poetry Collection" at hand, so the poem titles may be misremembered.) After hiding in Yangzhuang for several months, he returned to Shanghai but almost got arrested, so he fled to Japan. Therefore, there was a league in my hometown (Guanxingtang), which was also founded by Mr. Chen, and my late father Yingcai was in charge of it and almost went to prison. This is a digression, please return to the main text.

Once, I remember Mr. Chen giving a speech at a memorial meeting at a school: "Shanghai's Great Stage was founded by me." Then he told the story of running newspapers and magazines and using the teahouse as a revolutionary base.

Now Mr. Chen has returned to the Tao and Mr. Liu has also passed away this year. Of the people at that time, only Mr. Liu Yazi survives.

Movie Review

### Three Sisters' Tears

— Li Zhihua

The Sisters, produced by Warner Bros., showing at the Grand Theatre

"Three Sisters' Tears" has a mournful and beautiful story. It is more sophisticated than the so-called amusing comedies and flirtatious romances.

The author is somewhat lamenting that the scenery is the same as before, but the faces have changed. He used the Nydes' family going to the presidential election dance to begin with, and also used the presidential election dance to end, echoing each other from beginning to end, handled very skillfully and sophisticatedly: but also because of this, it is easier to make people feel the sense of travelers in heaven and earth, the dew of life. The style of "old palace ladies are still there, sitting idly and talking about Emperor Xuanzong" certainly has its so-called poignant poetic meaning, but it always infects the audience with a passive grayness.

And in fact, a story like "Three Sisters' Tears," if the director wants to emphasize its social significance, it is not impossible to do so, and it is very easy to do so, for example, writing about Frank's experience in a positive way, and emphasizing it. But now it is not like this, the focus of the whole play is on Louise, Frank is just a foil, and the joys and sorrows of her two younger sisters Helen and Grace are also just foils.

Putting the focus on Louise is naturally determined by the director's world view and outlook on life; he pays too much attention to human relationships and ignores society, unaware that the starting point of human relationships is based on society.

Therefore, the feeling that "Three Sisters' Tears" gives people is only leisurely and melancholy; and its social value is limited to this.

If the desire to watch a play is only to get a little bit of helpless melancholy, then "Three Sisters' Tears" can be classified as a good one, especially since the director is able to control this kind of mood everywhere. For example:

Louise and Frank's night escape, Helen and Grace's seeing them off on the steps by the window, a desolate road, a carriage carrying a pair of lovers far away.

After Frank loses his job, he hides it from Louise and becomes a sailor on a ship, and the moment he says goodbye to Louise before leaving.

Other things, such as the Nydes' family's preparations before going to the party, and the introduction of Louise and Frank's appearance, also have good techniques; and the different guests before the two parties, as well as Louise's rushing down when she first hears Frank coming on the escalator, and her staggering back from the boxing ring after marriage, are all good contrast techniques. These techniques are concise and meaningful, but lack a little strength. And if the director is willing to put in some effort and pay more attention to social value, it is not impossible to do so, for example, the superimposed printing of Frank's job application at various newspapers after losing his job is very compact and powerful, and Frank's hearing about the San Francisco earthquake and the return of the ship not being allowed, and then thinking of going ashore are also more powerful.

Errol Flynn plays Frank in this play, and his acting skills are not weak. We have seen his "The Dawn Patrol" and "The Adventures of Robin Hood," and thought that he would only play good roles of bravery and fighting, but in this play, he is surprisingly calm and sophisticated, and the handsome air in the martial arts film makes people feel the cuteness of a manly man; Bette Davis' Louise is not bad either, this big-eyed actress is very able to convey her identity and emotions; even Annie Terluise, who plays the second sister Helen, also has good acting skills, and the other supporting roles are also quite well-matched. After being tired of watching noisy and amusing films and flirtatious films, seeing such a film with literary interest, although it is still considered to be lacking in positive content, it cannot be said that it is a film worth watching.

### Rain After the Storm

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 1: The One-Armed Elder Organizes the Free Village, Twin Daughters Pay Respects at the Martyrs' Tomb

Two more days passed, and that Mr. He boarded the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Peiping flight and flew to Peiping. After finishing his business in Peiping, he would then go to Tientsin. He would probably stay in Tientsin for a week or two before going out to the Northeast. Since its recovery, the Northeast had made great progress in agriculture and animal husbandry in the past two years. Northeastern soybeans were sold all over the world, and because the quality was even better than before, they had become a major export of China. Therefore, the International Trade Commission was also paying close attention, and Mr. He had to go and investigate. After Mr. He left, the two Misses He were about to visit Zhu Ai. However, they were stopped by another sister, Miss Jin. Miss Jin said, "I know that since you two arrived in Shanghai, you have been trapped in banquets all day long and haven't had a chance to play in the suburbs of Shanghai. Now that your uncle has left and there are fewer banquets, come and stay at my house for a few days. We'll go on a suburban trip tomorrow." The two Misses He said, "There's no need to trouble you at your home. As for suburban trips, we'd like to go for a walk, but the suburbs of Shanghai are just filled with factories. What's there to play?" Miss Jin said, "Have you two sisters ever been to Dachang? There's a martyrs' tomb there, which occupies a large area and has recently been newly built. There's a large park around it, and the scenery is also very good. A lot of flowers and trees have been planted in recent years. The Shanghai area has a shortcoming: there are no mountains. But plains also have their advantages. Let's go for a trip there tomorrow. I'm very enthusiastic about this place." It turned out that Miss Jin was a descendant of a martyr. Her father used to be a brigade commander who led his troops against the enemy and died in Dachang. When the two Misses He heard that there was a martyrs' tomb there, they wanted to pay their respects. And knowing that Miss Jin's father was a martyr, they couldn't refuse her invitation. So, they agreed to go to the martyrs' tomb tomorrow, because tomorrow happened to be a Sunday, which was perfect for an outing. Miss Jin agreed to drive over to pick them up at ten o'clock tomorrow morning. The next morning, Miss Jin indeed drove over, but there was a man in the car. He was a young man named Lin. As soon as the two Misses He saw him, they knew he was Miss Jin's fiancé, because they had heard that her fiancé was named Lin. Miss Jin laughed and said, "Because the road is a little far and my driving skills aren't very good, I hired a driver." Of course, Miss Jin could drive herself, but not as well as her fiancé. At this moment, the car sped straight towards the Dachang Martyrs' Tomb. It was truly:

Picking emeralds dimly congeals green blood, Treading on green grass to mourn red faces.

### A Critical Discussion of the Play "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" (Part 1)

— Ce Hai

I. Discussion of Ideology

The play "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" is popular on various stages and in various theaters, and has been adapted into a movie. Most of the versions popular today adopt Ouyang Yuqian's revised script. Ouyang's script selects and tailors the most popular and attention-grabbing scenes for the audience, without detailed performances. And when Jinlian is killed, he adds a large section of novel and satisfying dialogue. All lovers of reformed Peking Opera consider themselves to be ideologically progressive. But I stubbornly believe this is wrong. This play is based on the old novel "Water Margin," and it fully develops the themes of brotherly love and the retribution of evil. The original script's ideology is not distorted. Ouyang focuses on the "bad marriage system" and forcibly writes Pan Jinlian as "suffering from environmental oppression, unable to break through feudal love, and thus becoming adulterous" -- Jinlian has a large section of dialogue when she is killed, with this as the main idea -- making the audience, at the moment of utter exposure, have no choice but to forgive and pity this adulterous woman. Alas! A script that was not distorted has now been twisted by this revision. Fortunately, Wu Song is an unprogressive, crude hero who only knows that his brother's revenge should be taken and his adulterous sister-in-law should be killed, and knows nothing else! If the Wu Song of that time had been moved by Jinlian's lengthy speech, and had his progressive consciousness stirred up, and thought even slightly about how the environment and marriage could ruin a woman's youth, and felt compassion for Jinlian's pitifulness, then Wu Er's steel knife would have been unable to advance or retreat after killing Ximen Qing. How would this play have ended? I once saw Zhou Xinfang and Wang Xichun perform this play together. After Xichun -- Jinlian -- finished a long speech -- according to Ouyang's script -- she bared her chest, showing her hot heart, which already belonged to Wu Er. Dying under Wu Er's knife, she would die content. She begged Wu Er to quickly deliver the blow. Xinfang stood blankly before Wu Da's spirit tablet, listened to a series of high-sounding arguments, and had an awkward expression, with no appropriate or proper response to this extremely adulterous and extremely deserving-of-death sister-in-law Pan Jinlian. He could only follow the revised script, ignore Jinlian's high-sounding arguments, remain deaf and blind, and still stab straight at her -- Jinlian's -- hot heart. At that moment, not only did Xinfang, who truly had progressive ideas, feel embarrassed, but also I, and many other audience members, also felt embarrassed. Know that this is a social play representing ancient times, a family ethics play expounding old rites and teachings, not today's so-called modern play. Why force the new consciousness of the 20th century into the brain of a Song Dynasty cake-selling woman? Moreover, chastity is our nation's virtue, and the purpose of acting is to encourage good and punish evil. If the playwright emphasizes chastity and ethics and considers Jinlian deserving of death, then he should not add the ingredient of "pity," causing the audience's view to be distorted and feel that "it's not good to kill, and it's not good not to kill," thus losing the purpose of encouraging good and punishing evil. Conversely, if Jinlian should not be killed, then the script should be thoroughly revised, simply exculpating Jinlian and creating the factors that made her not deserving of death. This would also be a unique and reasoned reversal of the drama. Now, one wants to kill her and forgive her, needlessly adding flaws to a sacred drama promoting morality and becoming neither fish nor fowl. Is this called reform? It's just meddling!

### A Record of Major Events in Yifeng Over the Past Year (Part 2)

— Ti Gong

The persons whom we had in mind were none other than the Jin sisters, most reasonable and ideal; however, after half a year of delays, nothing came of it. Although I added my tongue until my lips peeled, and Yun Chang made a declaration of kneeling, all was insufficient to change the situation. Subsequently, due to the introduction of a certain young master, Xiao Wu flapped her wings and flew over. Before she took the stage, the theater was completely renovated. Small advertisements were put up. On the evening of her last performance, she and Chunhang performed "Red Silk Rouge" and "Feng Xiaoqing." Pan Lang's wonderful emotions rediscovered of that year, and the crowding of the audience was even greater than before.

Xichun had a jade-like face and a golden voice. After getting a word from Mr. Tian Shou Cang, her value doubled. The news of her being hired had already caused a sensation in Chun Shen. Since taking the stage, admirers had flocked to her. With the addition of "Hate of the Fragrant Concubine" and "The Two Emperors Hui and Qin," she established Yifeng on an invincible foundation. But during this time, there were twists and turns, namely the retirement of Su Lian.

Before Chun Lai came, Lian had already expressed her intention to resign. The colleagues in front of the stage feasted her at a restaurant, earnestly explained the situation, and Lian understood and happily agreed to continue. During the performance of "Fragrant Concubine," Lian opened the show every night, seemingly without any resentment; however, those who once blamed You Xiaolan and lamented her fate suddenly turned to speak up for Lian. The central pivot in this situation is unknown. Because of words that offended the colleagues at Yifeng, the backstage gradually became dissatisfied with Lian. Thus, Lian had no choice but to painfully announce her departure. The development and outcome of the situation were exactly the same as Lan's departure, which deeply lamented the strangeness of fate, which had reached such an extreme. Our regret at Lian's departure was just as great as Lan's. Lian was humble and eager to learn, and earnest in everything she did. With Xinfang's influence, she suddenly made rapid progress, advancing a thousand miles in a day. Given time, her achievements would have been immeasurable. In the past, the front and backstage had a harmonious relationship, with everyone's unanimous approval. She also never had any significant friction with Xiao Wu. Yet now, due to circumstances and restrictions, they could not continue their collaboration. Who was responsible for this? Outsiders may not understand and may think that Lian was narrow-minded, or that Xinfang did not care about his meritorious ministers. These are all superficial views. Readers of my article should know why Lian left and why Lan went north. How terrifying is the pen of a scholar! How terrifying! Now that Lian is assisting Su Qin, soaring in the Golden Theater. The magnificence of her performance on the opening night surpassed that of the great elder sister. Her future is limitless, and I would also like to use the space in this column to express my fragrant wishes to her.

So, who can fill the vacancy left by Su Lian? After discussions, the consensus was to replace Su with Su. Fortunately, with the help of Xiao Die and the two brothers Xuan, Su Wen agreed to return. The performance of "Magnificent Fate" was already a great success. When "Wen Su Chen" came out, its novelty and charm emptied the streets and opened up an unprecedented box office record, comparable to the grand occasion of the "Investiture of the Gods" at Tianchan in those years. What is especially gratifying is that Xichun and Su Wen, these three beautiful ladies, shared food and clothing, and their relationship was so harmonious that trouble-makers could not find any opportunity. From now on, they can work together to overcome difficulties, and the waters will be calm. This spring's plan, in addition to continuing to perform "Wen Su Chen," includes announcing new plays, such as "Wen Tianxiang" and "Shi Kefa." With careful planning and preparation, the victory seems assured.

### Feng Zihe Will Guest Star at the Golden Theater—Four Days of Plays Have Been Scheduled Yesterday

— Hai Sheng

Yesterday afternoon, I went to Feng Zihe's house to discuss something, but there were already two guests there: Han Jinkui and Zhou Wubao, the backstage managers of the Golden Grand Theater. They were contacting Feng to arrange for four days of guest performances. After careful consideration, they decided on "Playing the Flower Drum," "A Match at the Flower Fair," "Feng Xiaoqing," and "Red Silk Rouge," all of which are his captivating masterpieces. The performance dates have not yet been set, but they will probably be realized soon. As for whether the four days of plays will be performed consecutively, or two days first, followed by a day or two of rest, it will depend on Han Jinkui's discussions with the authorities at the Golden Theater. It is a blessing for the opera world that we can appreciate his art.

I was entrusted by someone to introduce two little girls to Feng's Chunhang Opera Troupe to learn opera, but unfortunately, since he took on the role of playwright at the Golden Theater, he has disbanded the troupe. Now, only three female apprentices are still following him to learn opera. He told me that he plans to start a troupe in the future to cultivate talent. Last time, he went to Wang Lanfang to discuss performing two days of charity performances to raise funds for this matter.

Feng believes that today's female opera singers are disappointing, even saying that they don't even know how to walk with lotus steps. He says that this is partly due to the teachers' improper guidance, especially for those who are just starting out. If the foundation is not right, it will ruin people's children for life. So, he is afraid of taking on apprentices who are just starting out. The other half is that they are too opinionated and do not obey the teachers' guidance, which is terrible. Because of their age, if they do not obey people's guidance, they will never have the opportunity to improve and progress. When he was a playwright at the Carlton Yifeng Theater, even Zhou Xinfang would ask him for advice on performance and obey him. When rehearsing "Wen Ruyu" in the past, if someone recited or performed something incorrectly, he would have the entire scene rehearsed again until it was perfect. The art of Wang Xichun and Jin Suwen has improved compared to before, which is due to their ability to obey people's guidance.

Finally, he talked about the issue of performing modern plays, saying that modern plays should not be sung like modern plays. This means that modern plays should be sung like old plays in order to have a wonderful performance. Otherwise, if people think that it's a modern play and act recklessly on stage, it will be completely meaningless. Zhou Xinfang's performance of new plays, whether in hand movements, eye movements, body movements, techniques, or steps, all follow the old plays. This is the key to his success. Coming out of his house, I felt that his views were very correct, so I wrote them down in a rambling way for the reference and guidance of performers in the opera world.

### Impressions of Three Female Calligraphers and Painters Exhibiting Works to Aid Refugees

— Xuan Xuan

Women are more easily moved to compassion by the misery of refugee life. Artists in Shanghai have exhibited their famous works to raise money for refugees through the sale of paintings, and this has happened countless times in the past year. However, there are very few calligraphy and painting exhibitions that are purely initiated and organized by women.

Chen Zhixin, Wang Ruiquan, and Zhou Jie, these three young women, broke through this difficulty. They bravely held a joint exhibition at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association. Although the level of their works is not very high, their enthusiasm for disaster relief is still worthy of our admiration.

When the reporter visited yesterday, it happened that the three ladies were all busy receiving guests at the venue. So, after a week of visits, I conducted a brief interview with the three ladies.

Miss Chen Zhixin seems to have attracted the most attention from visitors. This is not only because Miss Chen's liveliness and naivety, like a little bird leaning on someone, is eye-catching in the venue, but also because her works are of a higher standard than the other two. But she is the youngest, only twenty-one years old this year, and has only graduated from the Shanghai Art College for one year. Her artistic talent is unique and highly valued by the teachers at the Art College. Therefore, almost two-thirds of her works have inscriptions by Liu Haisu, Xie Gongzhan, Wang Geyi, etc. Her achievements in flower painting are higher than those in landscape painting, so most of her flower masterpieces have been purchased by those with quick feet, and the prices are very low, with each piece priced from only five to fifteen yuan. Miss Chen told me that all the proceeds from their painting exhibition will be donated to the Refugee Vocational Training Center, and the artists will not receive a commission. The reason for the lower prices, she humbly said to the reporter in Shanghai dialect: "The stuff is too poor!" In fact, she was being polite. In order to sell more paintings, they had to lower prices, which is the real reason. The advertisement for their exhibition was introduced by Mr. Huang Jinrong. The reporter asked how they got Mr. Huang's enthusiastic introduction. So, she spoke and walked, pulling Miss Zhou Jie over to introduce her to the reporter:

"This is Miss Zhou Jie. Her father is friends with Mr. Huang, so Mr. Huang is willing to help."

Miss Zhou Jie is from Hubei Province. She is five years older than Miss Chen and is a very amiable woman. Because of Mr. Huang's help, most of her sales tickets had been sold before the opening. She is very enthusiastic and has put a lot of effort into the success of this painting exhibition. Her works are priced very uniformly, all at ten yuan. Some of her landscapes are very ancient and simple, but she said very naturally and humbly: "I'm still learning!"

She and Miss Wang Ruiquan are currently studying at the Art College, and the exhibition is their first attempt, but it has already achieved good results. Another Miss Wang Ruiquan, during our conversation, she stood silently on the side. She is the oldest of the three ladies, and all of her works, except for a few light ink landscapes, are painted with an ancient and simple style, not like the style of a woman. She is from a prominent family in Jiangyin and is a lady from a family of scholars. In the three days of the exhibition, almost all of the more than three hundred works have been sold, with an income of about seven or eight hundred yuan, which was collected on the spot by the staff of the Refugee Vocational Training Center. I hope that the ladies of Shanghai can paint more works to help the refugees!

Dance World Sketches

### Intermediate Dance Halls (6)

— Xiao Tian

Recently, due to the busy year-end accounting affairs, I failed to submit my manuscript, causing the advance notice in this publication to break faith with readers. I sincerely apologize for this and will guarantee that there will be no more missed deadlines in the future.

The number of intermediate dance halls in Shanghai is truly countless. Although it is inevitable that some will be omitted, it seems that I cannot leave out those that I have visited. This article has been serialized three times, which may make readers feel bored; however, considering the overall structure of "Dance World Sketches," the order must be maintained. Readers, please be patient. The next two articles, "Dance Girl Sketches" and "Dance Girl Close-Ups," may still reveal some residual and incomplete meanings.

Opposite the Genma Hall is a Da Hu Dance Hall, which is frequented by foreign sailors in the evening. The tea dances feature all-domestic dance girls and dance styles. It has not been open for long. When it first opened, in addition to serving fragrant tea, it also gave away Western-style pastries. Jin Lili, Jin Didi, Ye Peishan, and others from the Da Du Hui all work there. The interior decoration is quite magnificent, and the pool is rectangular and very large. The music is also acceptable. After seven o'clock, it changes to Cantonese music, and at seven thirty, the foreign sailors arrive, making it almost impossible to stay. However, even before seven o'clock, foreign sailors patronize the place, and they all go to the wine bar. From this, we can see that Westerners adhere to time and order. Even when they are having fun, they do not overstep the boundaries. I still remember ten days after the August 13th Incident in the 26th year, I took a car from Fanhuangdu in West Shanghai to Suzhou to pick up my family. At that time, Japanese planes were frequently visiting. The car was originally scheduled to depart at five o'clock, but it was delayed for more than two hours because it was ordered to wait for a certain dignitary. The passengers were all worried and depressed, but no one dared to object. The obedience of the Chinese people is evident from this.

The Yangzi is located under the Yangzi Hotel on Sanma Road. It occupies a small area and is very old. The dance floor is a small rectangle, and the floor has elasticity. I often visited it several years ago, and many people from the Northern District enjoyed it. The decoration has recently been changed to black ceramic tiles, which seems to make it look larger, but it ultimately feels glaring and inappropriate. It sells tea and snacks in the afternoon, and business is very prosperous. The nightlife may not be the same.

The Da Da Hua, formerly known as the Du Cheng, is located on Marlborough Road in the French Concession. Next door is the Jin Cheng Tea Room. The dance floor is a long circle, and the lighting and decoration are not bad, but it is not the same as the old Da Da Hua in Hongkou.

The Aina is located at the diagonal bridge on Jing'an Temple Road. It used to be a high-end dance hall, but I don't know why it closed down. Now it has been changed to a one-yuan-five dance hall. The interior decoration of the venue is of course beautiful. After twelve o'clock at night, there are several apple contests, which are quite interesting. I once won a small doll, which my wife gave to my little one, and it was greatly praised. It is a pity that there is only one cloakroom downstairs.

### Yilin Troupe's Weekly Theater Performance

Recently, the Yilin Troupe has been rehearsing the three famous plays "Red Lantern," "Liu Sanye," and "The Executioner" day and night, and they have been completed. The first public performance is scheduled for tomorrow (15th) at 10:00 AM. Location: Carlton Grand Theater.

### Announcement

The manuscript fees for the month of December have been settled. Please, all contributors, sign and stamp the receipts and collect them from the Accounting Office between 1:00 PM and 4:00 PM every day from the 17th (except Sundays).

### Secret History of the Imperial Court and Pear Garden of the Old Capital (7)(4)

— Xu Muyun

Gong Yunfu Scolds Lu Wu but Cannot Do Without Lu Wu

An old actor sometimes talked to this unworthy one about this old man, saying that many famous actors in our profession, just this amateur from Shanghai, Mr. Gong, has never used his strength throughout his life, never cut his tendons, so everyone calls him "Feng Guan." This means that Lao Gong's performance is like a certain item that has been inspected by the government, and can be freely passed anywhere without hindrance. This shows how good Lao Gong's interpersonal relationships are.

The one now called Mr. Lu by people in the know is Lu Hualing (nickname Big Nose, the fourth in his family), the younger brother of the famous Xiaosheng actor. In his youth, he was the same kind of person as Huaqiang Sun Lao. He always carried a sharp blade with him. Whenever he fought with people, it was always a white knife going in and a red knife coming out, a tough guy. Therefore, Xiao Lu Wu's reputation once caused a sensation around the bridge. Later, seeing that Sun Lao Yuan had suffered a setback, he calmed down and concentrated on the art of acting. The way he pulled the Huqin was also the same as Sun Lao, specializing in strength, danger, and strangeness. However, he had a problem, which was that his left thumb liked to cover the top of the thousand-pound weight, so the higher it went, the farther apart the front and back would be after a play was sung. When Lao Gong was strong, his voice was high and bright, and it seemed that this was suitable. Because his method was gradually getting higher, he didn't feel any effort, but when his energy weakened in his later years, he felt difficulties. However, Lu Wu had become accustomed to it and couldn't improve it. Therefore, these two old gentlemen often argued (arguing means quarreling). Lao Gong sometimes got angry and started scolding on stage, saying, "Good grandson, you want to pull your grandfather to death." Lu Wu would scold back: "Old boy, you sing. Your fifth master has been pulling you like this for decades. The more I pull you, the better you get. Why are you blaming me in your old age? Do you really want to remarry?" It happened that they were singing "Fishing Gold Hook" that day, so Lu Wu also scolded him with lines from the play, making everyone on the scene, including Lao Gong himself, laugh. Although the two old men were scolding each other in this half-truth, half-fake way, in fact, no one could do without the other. In recent years, Mr. Lu Wu has also been playing the Huqin for Duo Kui and Wo Yun. Because these two people were cultivated by him (although they are nominally disciples, in fact, most of the advice comes from Lu), they can't do without Lao Lu even more.
