### German Clearing Operations Near Warsaw 　Polish Army Defends River, Front Line Gradually Stabilizing　German Army Changes Strategy, Focusing on Northeast, Including Operations Like Fortresses　Major Battle Points in Central Region Are Historical Fortresses

Paris – According to news received here from Poland, it is understood that Polish troops have been able to contain the German advance on all fronts, with the total front line reduced from 1,300 kilometers to 700 kilometers. The German motorized units have not yet entered Warsaw, and due to fierce Polish resistance, they have had to withdraw from the outskirts of Warsaw. This fact has also been acknowledged by various German radio stations. As for the German troops in East Prussia, who originally planned to cross the Bug River and assist in the attack on Warsaw, they have now had to change their direction to the Suwałki area in the north due to strong Polish resistance. (Havas, 11th)

Beijing – According to reports received here, the people of Warsaw are defending the city day and night. The resistance of the Polish army is becoming increasingly well-organized. It is reported that the German advance in several areas has indeed been contained. The German troops advancing from East Prussia have not made much progress beyond the positions they occupied five days ago, and they have not been able to attack Warsaw from the west. It is reported that they are now planning to change their strategy and attack from the east. However, according to Polish military authorities, this move by the German army creates a very narrow salient, which is in danger of being cut off near Białystok and Grodno. The Polish side claims that the German troops advancing from Slovakia have ventured too deep and have been driven back by the defending forces. The defending forces have repeatedly achieved local victories. The Polish command in the Corridor area also reports that cavalry is still resisting German troops in favorable terrain. (Reuters, 12th)

Berlin – According to the German News Agency, German troops advancing from the north have met with no resistance and are now approaching the Vistula River. The Modlin Fortress, built by Napoleon, is now within range of German artillery fire. The fortress is located on the right bank of the Vistula River, at the confluence of the Vistula, Bug, and Narew rivers, 20 miles northwest of Warsaw. In 1915, the Russian army defended Warsaw with the Narew River against Hindenburg's forces. The radio station also announced that German troops are now driving into the Polish industrial city of Łódź, which is located 82 miles southwest of Warsaw. (Reuters, 12th)

Warsaw – The Commander-in-Chief has just issued a battle report stating that the situation near Suwałki in the north has not changed. At Łomża on the Narew River, enemy troops are launching fierce attacks with motorized units, and our troops are engaged in fierce fighting. The situation at Modlin in the central region has not changed. After heroic resistance, the defending forces have repelled the enemy troops near Warsaw. The fighting near Kutno and along the Bzura River is quite intense. (Havas, 11th)

London – According to the German official news agency, German troops have captured the town of Łomża on the Narew River in northern Poland. However, the Polish General Staff denies this, stating only that fierce fighting is still taking place near the town. The Łomża Fortress, located 80 miles northeast of Warsaw, was occupied by German troops in 1915 and later returned to Poland. It has a population of 32,000. (Reuters, 12th)

Berlin – Since the capture of the Łomża Fortress on the Narew River, the strong defense line built by Poland on that river, based on the former fortresses of Imperial Russia, has fallen into German hands. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Berlin – This morning, the German military headquarters issued a battle report stating that the main battle between German and Polish forces west of the Vistula River is nearing its end. Southern troops are preparing to cross the Bzura River. German troops north of the Vistula River are still advancing towards the Modlin Fortress.

(Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Berlin – According to German war reports, German and Polish forces will engage in their first major decisive battle today in a 250-mile zone in the center of Poland. The decisive point will be in the Łódź area, a semicircular front line northeast to southeast of Warsaw. Polish troops in Warsaw, the Vistula River, the Bug River, and the Łódź area have all occupied important locations and are preparing for action. German progress has been slower in the past 48 hours, but the fighting has been the fiercest since the start of the war. (Associated Press, 12th)

### Soviet Troops　Concentrate on Western Border　To Prevent Polish Troops from Retreating　Romania Also Increases Troops on Soviet Border

Lithuanian Capital – According to Moscow reports, the Soviet Union has implemented a partial mobilization as a precautionary measure against Polish troops retreating to the Soviet border. (Reuters, 12th)

Moscow – The Soviet official newspaper "Pravda" stated today that the concentration of Soviet troops on the western border is to prevent Polish troops from retreating into the Soviet Union. If Polish troops do retreat into Soviet territory, Soviet troops will disarm them first. The newspaper also stated that Poland has been effectively defeated, and its military and economic centers have fallen. Poland's own "disorganized army and lack of strong fortifications are insufficient to resist the German army, and its allies have not provided sufficient assistance." The tense situation in Moscow has now passed, and public morale has stabilized somewhat.

Moscow – The reserve troop mobilization is almost complete, so people here are not as panicked as before. However, many people are still gathering outside banks, continuing to withdraw deposits to buy food and jewelry. There are fewer vehicles on the streets because many cars have been requisitioned by the army. Theaters and cinemas have very few visitors. (Reuters, 12th)

Romanian Capital – Romanian troops began concentrating on the Soviet border today. It is reported that there were no special precautions taken by the Soviet Union on the Dniester River, but recently the Soviet Union has also been building defensive works there, so Romania cannot help but take precautionary measures. In short, Romania's defensive works are entirely in the hands of the French Southern Army and Western Army. (Associated Press, 12th)

### Germany Strictly　Limits Consumption

Paris – News has just been received here from neutral countries stating that Germany has introduced new measures to limit consumption. Gasoline consumption will be strictly limited from the 20th of this month, with all vehicles except those used by government agencies prohibited from operating.

Yesterday, being a Monday, the menu of a large hotel in Berlin offered nothing but cabbage rice porridge and apple pie, but the meal price was not reduced. As for the transportation industry, only waterways are available for transporting goods from mainland Germany to East Prussia. According to the Rotterdam newspaper in the Netherlands, German hotels will have to reduce their daily purchases of fats and butter by 40% and white sugar by 25% to 40% from the first of next month. This measure is intended to restrict people who have reduced their food purchases from switching to eating in restaurants. In addition, the German government issued an order on the 9th of this month restricting the use of various metals in the construction industry. When Air Minister Goering recently gave a speech to a munitions factory, he only mentioned the supply of iron and did not discuss the supply and demand of other metals, indicating that the German authorities have had to restrict the consumption of various metals. (Havas, 11th)

Zurich, Switzerland – News has just been received here from Berlin stating that half of all elementary schools in Germany have been converted into hospitals.

Rome – After Turkish Prime Minister Saydam explained his country's foreign policy to the National Assembly yesterday, people here generally felt a great deal of interest and said that there were three noteworthy points: (1) The entire speech did not mention the word "neutrality." (2) The country has adopted a strategic position. (3) The country's attitude may change depending on the development of the situation. In addition, the country continues to adhere to the spirit on which the Balkan Entente is based and respects the commitments made to Romania that are accepted by all countries. For this reason, political figures here hope that it can exert a positive influence on the Soviet government. (Havas, 12th)

### German Bombing Policy　Polish Hatred Deepens

Finnish Capital – A Latvian journalist who recently returned from Warsaw stated that the German aerial bombing strategy employed on the Polish rear has provoked great hatred towards Germany. The road he traveled was filled with the tragic sight of villages and towns burned and people displaced. As far as the eye could see, thick smoke rose, indicating that towns had been reduced to ashes. The destruction caused by German incendiary bombs was terrifying. Residents are now taking refuge in the forests, and the country roads are littered with corpses. (Reuters, 12th)

### Map of Warsaw's Situation

Since the battle for Warsaw began last Friday night and fell into initial disarray, the general form of events can now be assessed. As Poland is a large open plain, there is no geographical high ground which could be used for defence. The Vistula, Narew and Bug rivers are its main strategic advantages for its defence. At the point where the three rivers meet Napoleon had built the Modlin Fortress, which along with the Narew River Łomża Fortress and Warsaw itself create a hornworks defensive structure. Regarding the German advance, it is being made along five routes, if one sees Warsaw as the centre, according to German war reports, the southern route has entered Łódź, the western route has arrived at Kutno, the north-western route is directly attacking Modlin, the northern route has already taken Łomża, although that has not been confirmed, and the north-eastern route has Białystok as its goal, implementing an encirclement operation.

Editorial

### Sorting and Promoting Common International Beliefs

Political scholars of the modern era must understand that the establishment of a national system is based on the beliefs of its constituent members. When a nation supports republicanism, it becomes a republic; when it respects the rule of law, the constitution becomes a norm; when subjects love and support the monarch, it becomes a kingdom or a dictatorship; when several states need and complement each other, it becomes a federation or a confederation. Are these just empty theories of scholars and pedantic talk of Confucian scholars? The ultimate truth that cannot be overturned exists, becoming an iron rule for managing the world. Applying this to international affairs, I believe it is also true.

In recent years, the world has deeply sighed at the dimming of international justice, the reversal of civilization, and the gradual emergence of a state of anarchy; however, it has only sighed and has not tried to uphold it. The world also deeply hates violent aggression; however, it has only deeply hated it and has not resolved to completely eliminate it. Judging from the atmosphere of recent years, although it is said that contradictions are intricate, crises are everywhere, it is almost difficult to believe that there would be a war like this today. Even if there is a war, it would only be like the war between China and Japan; Poland, instead of submitting like Czechoslovakia and Austria, would probably only be like Abyssinia and Albania, exhausting its own efforts and fighting Germany alone. Who would have known that Britain and France would rise up with arms and come to its aid? This is a judgment that we would not have dared to make even half a month ago, and it is also something that German leader Hitler was astonished and horrified by. Not only that, but the Soviet Union's abandonment of Britain and France to conclude a non-aggression pact with Germany, and the dissolution of the Hiranuma Cabinet in Japan, with the prime minister's selection falling to Abe, may also have been based on the assumption that Germany and Poland might have problems and Britain and France would have no intention of fighting. Was this one of the hypothetical premises for the Soviet Union and Japan? This is something that we cannot help but imagine after the rise of Britain and France. Why? What Britain and France have shown in recent years is that they have sighed and deeply hated, but they have not shown that they love justice, love civilization, and love the international order as much as they love everything in their own country; we have this view, and the Soviet Union, Japan, and even Germany probably have the same view.

Now that Britain and France have declared war on Germany for ten days, in these ten days, the reasons why Britain and France have declared their significance of warfare have been like a string of beads. Take Britain as an example: there is the edict of King George VI, the broadcast speech of Prime Minister Chamberlain, the parliamentary speech of Foreign Secretary Halifax, the article of the new Naval Minister Churchill, the broadcast speech of the new Minister of Overseas Dominions Eden, and the British government's note to the League of Nations, which cannot be listed exhaustively. The main points are summarized as four points: (1) We are not fighting for a dispute over a distant city (the Free City of Danzig), we do not hate the German people, and we do not intend to destroy Germany; (2) We are fulfilling our obligations to Poland; (3) We oppose violent aggression, punish betrayal, uphold justice, guarantee freedom, restore international order, and establish lasting peace; (4) As long as National Socialism exists, the civilized world cannot be realized, so we must strive for complete victory and never give up halfway. Every speech is full of generosity and righteousness. After listening from afar, we not only understand the significance of Britain and France going to war and deeply believe in the ambitions and beliefs of Britain and France in this way; but also estimate that this decision to go to war must have supreme value for human civilization and international welfare; in fact, Britain and France can win, and in principle, Britain and France should win.

However, I still feel that there is something lacking. The reason is that what Britain and France have shown in recent years has not been as strict and righteous as the words after the declaration of war; moreover, before and after the declaration of war, they often blamed Germany for failing to accept peace negotiations. Let's consider this: if the declaration of war is absolutely strict and righteous, how can it be carried out in negotiations? Then what is the purpose of proposing negotiations on the eve of the declaration of war? Is it to use negotiations to make Germany abandon its National Socialism, which threatens world civilization? If negotiations are held, how will it resolve the various sincere ambitions and beliefs? Therefore, although we sympathize with and trust Britain and France today, the central consciousness of Britain and France is divided into several fragments between the past and the present; the actual actions of Britain and France are also divided into several paragraphs in the recent short period; after twists and turns, and reorganization, it is like today, which is what those who deeply love Britain and France cannot hide for Britain and France. Because there is something that cannot be hidden like this, it has not been able to gain the most universal response in the international community. For example, in the United States: the current neutrality law, which is unfavorable to Britain and France, needs to be amended; and yesterday's telegram said that it is still not possible to immediately convene a special session of Congress; this is because Senator Borah, who speaks out against it, may be limited by party strife, or suffer from short-sightedness, or stubbornly hold onto the prejudices of isolationism, or be contaminated by the propaganda of other countries, and therefore the various sincere ambitions and beliefs of Britain and France are not enough to make him respond, which is not to be discussed; even wise men like President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, since Britain and France declared war on Germany, have not made any strong statements other than declaring the neutrality of the United States; is this because the "sense of justice" of the President and Secretary of State is insufficient?

Everything that is not accomplished without time, such as the ripening of a melon and the completion of a canal when water flows, is natural, but for it to ripen and for it to arrive, time is necessary, and it cannot be obtained in an instant even with the power of a thunderbolt. From this, we know that the thorough implementation of Britain and France's beliefs and the response to the international community all depend on a considerable amount of time after the establishment of their central consciousness; the ten days since the declaration of war are only the beginning of establishing a central consciousness. After it has begun, it must be held firm and carried out with more difficulty, and it must prove the strictness of its attitude and the firmness of its beliefs; what is true today is also true in the future, what is true for Germany is also true in Europe, and by extension, what is true for the Far East and the Pacific is no different, then it will eventually universally respond to the international community, which can be asserted. If the international community forms a common belief in this, then it can also be asserted that justice, civilization, and order will be established. The past pathology of the international community lies in knowing what to sigh at but not striving for it, and knowing what to hate deeply but not eliminating it completely; Britain and France also suffered from this pathology before declaring war on Germany; and as of now, the various countries other than China and Britain and France are still groaning like Britain and France did ten days ago. The governments and people of all countries can abide by the law and love their country and be loyal to their monarch, so the system of their country is clear and bright; and the clarity and brightness of the international community depends on the establishment of a common belief by all countries; is the war in Britain and France the beginning of the expansion and greatness of the common international belief?

### The Western Front Remains Quiet Yesterday, British Vanguard Troops Arrive in France, Air Force Units Also Arrive, French Residents Express Great Welcome

London, This afternoon, the Information Department made its first official announcement that British troops have landed in France. The announcement stated that the British troops are not yet engaged in combat, and no further details are available at this time. According to news from Paris, France has made full preparations to receive the British troops based on the experience gained during the last Great War. Barracks in various bases have been built, and a large supply of provisions has been prepared for the continuous arrival of British troops. Ammunition depots have been quickly constructed, and hospitals are ready. British troops are now moving to various locations within France aboard freight cars marked "Capacity: 40 men, 8 horses." French girls often cheer the soldiers in the cars as the train passes through quiet villages, while the able-bodied men of the villages have already joined the army. (Reuter, 12th)

Paris, The movements of British land and air forces in France are still kept strictly secret. The general public only knows that British troops have arrived here. However, in the past few days, British sources here have learned that a large number of British air personnel, supported by the latest aircraft, are now stationed in France. It is also reported that British troops have landed in France. According to news from various villages and towns, residents are expressing great welcome to the British troops. (Reuter, 12th)

London, After the arrival of British troops in France, the "London Evening Standard" commented: "The troops of our country fighting alongside the French troops are only the vanguard. However, our people are determined to eliminate the semi-mad and utterly untrustworthy Hitler and his treacherous National Socialism, and we must make great efforts. We should neither act hastily nor be careless. If needed in the future, these tens of thousands of soldiers can easily become millions, and these divisions can easily become several corps, until Hitler and his rogue government are overthrown and peace is restored in Europe." (Havas, 12th)

Paris, The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 16, stating: "Despite fierce resistance from the enemy, our troops continue to advance. The battle line has now been extended twenty kilometers east of Saaralbe. Our troops have made significant progress." (Havas, 11th)

Paris, According to observers here, the German forces on the Western Front, fearing that they might be forced to retreat into the Siegfried Line's concrete and steel defenses, have taken the offensive in the Sierck area near the Luxembourg border to alleviate this danger and to maintain forward outposts such as artillery positions and observation posts as long as possible. The German General Staff knows that it will soon be forced to deal with a true French offensive, so it is now planning a counter-offensive to delay the French advance, allowing the German forces to arrange everything in the fortified bunkers. (Reuter, 12th)

Paris, The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 17, stating: "The entire front was quiet last night." Semi-official sources added, in the same manner as yesterday, that for the past three days, our troops have made progress in the Saar region of Germany and have consolidated the occupied positions. Although our troops have advanced smoothly on a vast front, large-scale combat has not yet begun. As things stand, our troops have achieved the most notable results east of Saarbrücken (a major industrial area). The German Siegfried Line is located ten kilometers north of this city. (Havas, 12th)

Paris, Renowned journalist Maurice recently commented on the situation of the Franco-German war in the "Petit Parisien," stating: "The German side attempted to launch an offensive on the French border along the Moselle River on the 10th of this month, advancing several hundred meters, but due to a counter-attack by arriving French reinforcements, it failed to make significant progress. Currently, French troops are continuing to attack in other areas, with particular emphasis on the area north of Saarguemines, between the Saar River and its tributary, the Blies River. At the same time, pressure is being intensified on Saarbrücken, and the German front line may retreat behind that city in the near future." (Havas, 12th)

### Czech Expatriates in France Form a Foreign Legion, Their Strength Should Not Be Underestimated

Paris, Czech Minister to France, Osuský, recently stated to the press that the Czech expatriate legion formed in France is not a volunteer army, but a formal force equal to the army of other countries. Although our country's territory has been occupied by a strong enemy, it is still an independent country in law. The French government recognizes the Czech foreign legion as an allied force that will fight alongside England, France, and Poland. To date, 50,000 expatriates have enlisted. Czech expatriates in England and the United States will soon come to participate. Their strength should not be underestimated. In the future, after the army is formed, it will be commanded by General Ingr, the commander of the Czech foreign legion during the last European War. (Havas, 11th)

### France Implements Exchange Controls, Financial Functions of England, America, and France Maintain Close Ties

Washington, After the French government implemented exchange controls, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau stated to the press that France's move was mainly to adapt to the extraordinary situation and was not intended to counter the American currency. "The spirit of the Anglo-Franco-American currency agreement naturally remains as before." England has also taken similar measures, so the current currency agreement will only continue to apply as usual between the United States and Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. However, the U.S. Treasury Department will still buy and sell gold to England, America and France, so the financial functions between the three countries remain linked and without difficulty. (Havas, 11th)

### Canadian Troops Permitted to Fight Abroad, $100 Million Allocated to Strengthen National Defense, Important Bills Passed by Senate and House

Ottawa, The Canadian government today informed Congress that it is preparing a $100 million fund for war. Since Canada declared war on Germany yesterday, it has stepped up preparations to transport munitions and troops to Europe to participate in the fighting alongside England and France. (Associated Press, 12th)

Ottawa, The Canadian federal government recently submitted a temporary national defense budget to the House of Commons, proposing to allocate 100 million Canadian dollars during this fiscal year (ending next March), in addition to the regular national defense budget, to strengthen national defense. Prime Minister King also announced in the House of Commons that a bill would be introduced to establish a Ministry of Munitions. In addition, the government is constantly taking measures to curb market monopolies and limit wartime profits. (Havas, 11th)

Ottawa, The national defense budget has been submitted to the House of Commons for discussion. A certain congressman proposed an amendment arguing that the troops of the province should only be allowed to fight within the province or in nearby areas, intending to prevent the provincial government from sending expeditions to Europe to participate in the war. The House of Commons rejected it and passed a resolution allowing the province's troops to fight both at home and abroad. Then, the temporary national defense budget was voted on, and the Senate also approved it. (Havas, 11th)

Ottawa, The "Ottawa Journal" recently reported that the Canadian federal cabinet may be reorganized into a national unity cabinet during the European war, still led by Liberal leader King as Prime Minister, and including Conservative leader Manion and leaders or representatives of other opposition parties. As things stand, the Liberal Party holds a large majority in Congress, so there is no need to reorganize the cabinet. However, it is generally believed that after the establishment of a national unity cabinet, firstly, all parties and factions in the country can unite during the war to increase strength, and secondly, the trouble of a congressional election in the autumn of this year can be avoided. (Havas, 11th)

### Indian Muslim Leader Professes Loyalty to England, Princes Express Same Sentiment

Trade union activists in western India also expressed their loyalty to England. (Reuter, 12th)

### France Notifies League of Nations of Declaration of War Against Germany

Paris, Foreign Minister Bonnet recently sent a letter to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol stating that Germany, regarding Poland, and regarding all obligations freely accepted by other signatory countries of the 1928 Paris Peace Pact, is now blatantly violating them and has inflicted aggressive actions upon Poland. As a result, the French government has had to provide assistance to Poland in accordance with the current treaties between France and Poland. Prior to this, all peace proposals made by the British and French governments were rejected by Germany. The French government was forced into this position, and therefore declared war on Germany at 5:00 PM on the 3rd of this month. I hereby report accordingly, and I hope that it will be forwarded to the governments of the member states. (Havas, 10th)

### Retired Japanese Air Force Officer Observes the War Situation

Tokyo, Major General Oyama, a retired officer of the Japanese Air Force and known for his research on Chinese military books, stated in a telephone interview from Rome with the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun that in this European war, Germany has no chance of winning quickly, nor do England and France. When two tigers fight, one is sure to die, and the other is sure to be fatally wounded. It is impossible to achieve a quick victory in modern warfare. Germany's victory in Poland may be assured, and once the battle in Poland is decided, Germany will concentrate on the war in the west. It is said that Hitler has obtained detailed maps of France's Maginot Line, which will greatly assist the German forces. However, France has spent ten years building a solid defensive line west of the German border. If Germany attacks this defensive line with its elite forces and is destroyed, the Nazi dictatorship will not be able to be maintained. Regarding this, Germany has not forgotten the painful experience it suffered in Verdun during the third year of the last Great War, where more than a million German soldiers died and were then strongly attacked by the Allied forces, blunting their edge. Hitler's ability to firmly control the German people is due to the Nazi organization and the army. It is said that the army accounts for 30-40% of the total population, and the rest of the people are middle-aged and elderly, many of whom are soldiers who have suffered the pain of war. These people harbor resentment towards the leader's arbitrariness, but dare not speak out. If the German army has a strength of 4 million men, England and France must recruit about 8 million men in order to defeat the German army by a ratio of two to one. It remains a question whether England and France can mobilize this huge number of troops in a relatively short period of time. (Reuter, 12th)

### Roosevelt Strongly Advocates Revising Neutrality Law, Congressional Isolationist Legislators Still Seek to Obstruct, American Factories Rush to Manufacture Military Aircraft for England and France

Washington, President Roosevelt returned to Washington from Hyde Park and immediately held talks with Secretary of State Hull. According to a White House spokesperson, the President has not yet made a decision on convening a special session of Congress to revise the current Neutrality Act. Political figures expect Congress to convene in three weeks. The President had suggested to the leaders of both the Republican and Democratic parties that the session of Congress should be as short as possible, but some Republican legislators expressed their opposition, saying that after Congress reconvenes, first, the issue of neutrality must be discussed with the greatest freedom, and second, Congress should not adjourn as long as there is a danger of the European war dragging the United States into the vortex. Senator Borah of the Republican Party also told the press that any action that attempts to force Congress to revise the Neutrality Act and abolish the arms embargo clause should be opposed. I do not want to discuss this point of view here, but this matter is of great importance and requires thorough research and discussion. (Havas, 11th)

Washington, Regarding the abolition of the arms embargo clause in the Neutrality Act, since the outbreak of the European war, President Roosevelt has consulted with the leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress, and the results have been very good. Once Congress holds a special session, the Senate and House of Representatives will be able to abolish this clause by a two-thirds majority vote. So far, the reason why the President has delayed convening Congress is that various concerns have not been completely dispelled. In other words, the President is deeply afraid that when Congress discusses this issue, a few isolationist legislators may revert to their old ways and obstruct it in various ways, causing the democracies of Europe to lose heart and Germany to rejoice, and therefore he is hesitant. However, since the Canadian Federation has declared war on Germany, if the current American Neutrality Act's arms embargo clause is not abolished, then even if one wants to sell arms to European democracies indirectly through Canada, it will not be possible. This situation is already unfair, and if it is allowed to drag on, the impact will endanger the neutrality of the United States and must be corrected as soon as possible. In addition, the number of people in American opinion circles who support materially assisting England and France is increasing day by day, which is another reason why the Neutrality Act must be revised quickly. However, it is not known what method the American government will use. Based on observation, it will probably submit the bill proposed by Chairman Bloom of the House Foreign Affairs Committee (this bill advocates abolishing the arms embargo clause) to the House of Representatives for discussion again. In short, President Roosevelt is in a very good position in the struggle with the isolationists, and most Republican legislators do not want to use the Neutrality Act as a tool for political struggle. (Havas, 11th)

Los Angeles, According to the heads of Douglas, North American, and five other aircraft manufacturers, they intend to continue manufacturing aircraft for England and France until the orders of 33 million US dollars are fulfilled. The aircraft manufacturers stated that although President Roosevelt has announced a ban on arms exports, they will continue to fulfill foreign orders. They expect the special session of Congress to amend the arms embargo clause of the Neutrality Act. Observers recall that the British Embassy in Washington recently requested American aircraft manufacturers not to stop manufacturing aircraft that Britain had ordered from the manufacturers before the outbreak of the European war. The British side in Washington also expects the Neutrality Act to be amended. The amendment of the Neutrality Act is strongly advocated by President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull.

### Japan Plans Large-Scale Offensive, Adopts New Offensive on All Fronts, Nishio Appointed Commander-in-Chief of Japanese Forces in China, Last-Ditch Effort to End War, Japan Tries Hard to Ease Relations with Soviet Union

Chongqing, Chinese military observers here expect the Japanese army to launch a large-scale new offensive against China in October. Because war has now broken out in Europe, the powers that previously helped China are now unable to provide large-scale assistance, so they have full confidence in this final attempt to subdue China. It is widely believed that since the Japanese have now placed the Japanese forces in North China, South China, and Central China under unified command, they will be able to launch an unprecedented large-scale offensive against the Chinese army to replace the previous localized attacks. People here in China believe that Japan's appointment of Nishio as commander-in-chief of the Japanese forces in China and Lieutenant General Itagaki as chief of staff of the Japanese forces in China is a prelude to Japan's initiation of a new political and military program in China in the near future. The underlying purpose of this program is to facilitate the establishment of a "central government" under the leadership of Wang Jingwei. It is reported that personnel from the Beijing and Nanjing regimes are very opposed to Wang's plan. Japan hopes that placing the Japanese forces in China under unified command will eliminate this opposition. Nishio has served in China before and was a division commander during the Shanhaiguan Incident. In 1938, he served as commander of the Second Army under Terauchi, and was responsible for the operations in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway during the Japanese attack on Xuzhou. At that time, Itagaki served as a division commander under him. Chinese sources claim that Nishio and Itagaki were both defeated by Chinese forces in the Battle of Taierzhuang. (Reuter, 12th)

Tokyo, The Japanese Army announced today that it has appointed several people to new positions "in order to effectively cope with the new stage of the Sino-Japanese War." Those appointed include General Nishio, Inspector General of Military Education, as Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Forces in China, and former Minister of the Army Lieutenant General Itagaki as Chief of Staff of the Japanese Forces in China. It is said that this is a prelude to Sugiyama, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Forces in North China, being appointed as the Japanese Ambassador to the new "Double Tenth Regime," the new central government under Japanese tutelage in China, which is expected to be established soon. Lieutenant General Umezu, the Japanese Ambassador to "Manchukuo," has been appointed to concurrently serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Kwantung Army. General Ueda, who is going, has been transferred to work in the General Staff Headquarters. (Reuter, 12th)

Tokyo, Tsuruzo Nishio, Inspector General of Military Education, has been appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Forces in China, and Itagaki, the Minister of the Army in the Hiranuma Cabinet, has been appointed as Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters. It is said that Japan's appointment is aimed at unifying and cooperating the Japanese forces in China, so as to easily "end" the war against China. Nishio is one of the three giants of the Japanese Army and is known as the taciturn general, 58 years old. (Associated Press, 12th)

Tokyo, Japan has indeed made every effort to ease relations with the Soviet Union. Its historical opposition, the conflicts on the "Manchu"-Mongolian border, and the attitude of the Kwantung Army are not unrelated. In order to show sincerity to the Soviet Union, Japan has stripped Ueda, the commander of the Kwantung Army, of his concurrent position as ambassador to "Manchukuo," and appointed Umezu to succeed him. According to news today, there is indeed something more shocking going on, because Ueda has not only lost his position as ambassador, but also his position as commander of the Kwantung Army will be succeeded by Umezu. Only after Umezu becomes the dictator of "Manchukuo" can he forcibly eliminate the border conflicts. It is said that Umezu has always advocated that, during the war against China, the Soviet Union must be appeased at all costs. (Associated Press, 12th)

### Overseas Chinese in Shan State Publicize Loyalty to Motherland

Chongqing: A medical team is scheduled to take a specially chartered plane this morning to Luxian, a hundred miles southwest of Chongqing, to treat those injured in yesterday's Japanese air raid on the city. Although no details of the bombing of Luxian have been received, it is generally believed that the casualties are quite heavy because the county was not defended. It is reported that 36 Japanese bombers participated in the attack, and medical facilities in the county are severely inadequate. According to officials here, a squadron of Chinese fighter planes patrolling the skies over Chongqing flew south from Chongqing during the air raid to intercept the Japanese planes as they flew back from Luxian.

### Saodang Bao Observes the European Situation and Predicts Important Developments

Chongqing: The Saodang Bao, the mouthpiece of the Chinese army, published an article today discussing the German army's sudden halt to its offensive towards Warsaw and even the possibility of a retreat from Krakow. The newspaper predicts that there will be major developments in Europe in the near future, and states that Germany may only station troops in the Polish Corridor, Danzig, and all other places that belonged to Germany before the Great War. At the same time, Germany may directly negotiate a "glorious peace" with Britain and France, or Italy may mediate. Under such circumstances, the attitude that Britain and France will adopt deserves our close attention. The newspaper reiterated that France has never formally declared war on Germany, but only notified Germany that France had no choice but to fulfill its obligations to Poland, and pointed out that Italy will maintain neutrality in the current war. The newspaper concluded by saying that there are no fierce attacks on either side of the Western Front, and that Britain, France, and Germany all seem to be deliberately refraining from bombing major cities. All of this indicates that a peace movement is not entirely impossible in the current war in Europe. (12th Reuters dispatch)

### Guangzhou Japanese Authorities Restrict the Movement of Germans

### Japanese Recruit Chinese Laborers, Concentrating in Qingdao with Unclear Intentions

Wuxi News: Recently, due to the depletion of its troop sources, the Japanese army has formed the Qingdao Joint Venture Company, the Mainland Chinese Labor Company, specializing in recruiting unemployed laborers from various places to serve in the military. They have successively sent personnel to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Changzhou, Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places to set up recruitment offices. Now, they have sent Japanese man Tian Junnan and several Chinese to Wuxi to set up a recruitment office at the Dadong Hotel, specializing in recruiting tile and wood workers.

The Japanese and puppet troops gathered to put out the fire before it was extinguished. More than ten buildings were burned down, causing huge losses.

### Ningbo Business Market Gradually Reveals Signs of Revival

Yinxian News: Since the fall of Dinghai County, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to strengthen defense, has ordered the blockade of Zhenhai and sunk the old Taiping ship within the blockade line. At that time, Japanese warships gathered outside the Zhenhai port, and successively fired guns at Zhenhai, Fenghua, and Hutou, causing disturbance. Japanese planes also dropped bombs in Cixi, Fenghua, Linhai, Haimen, and other places. The situation was tense for a time. However, in recent weeks, the Japanese warships gathered off the coast of Zhejiang have set sail and left, and Japanese planes have not been seen flying over for many days.

Since the implementation of the blockade of Zhenhai, ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo line have been diverted to anchor outside the Zhenhai port, and then transshipped into the port by small barges. Therefore, transportation and transshipment are time-consuming, and navigation is stagnant. The journey that used to take two days to complete now takes about a month. Recently, as many as fifteen or sixteen commercial ships from Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, and other countries have been docked. The German merchant ship Dabao and barges from the Zhenhai Ferry Company are now running back and forth between the Zhenhai wharf and outside the blockade line.

The Ningbo commercial market suffered several frenzied bombings by Japanese planes in April and May of this year, and there was a desolate scene everywhere. However, in recent months, due to the disappearance of Japanese planes, there have been gradual signs of revival. The Dongda Street area is closed every day in the morning, and business resumes after 3:00 p.m. Residents who have taken refuge in the countryside and the suburbs are also returning in droves. When the lights come on at night, the streets become lively, and it stops around 12:00 midnight, but business is still less than before.

### Oslo Convention Countries Hold Meeting

Brussels: The Standing Committee of the Oslo Convention countries held a meeting here yesterday, chaired by Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak. Switzerland, a non-member of the Oslo Convention, also sent observers to attend. The meeting was held in secret, and only a vague official report was issued afterwards. However, according to well-informed sources, the main topic of discussion was the British memorandum to the Belgian government, which stated Britain's determination to carry out an economic war against Germany. Therefore, Belgium's foreign trade will henceforth be limited to the amount necessary for Belgium's own consumption, and some goods have been listed as contraband. The memorandum was delivered to Belgium by a specially appointed British envoy. The Belgian government immediately responded, stating that it would discuss the memorandum with the other signatories of the Oslo Convention. Therefore, yesterday's meeting discussed in detail the impact of British measures on the Oslo countries and how the Oslo countries could help each other to cope with this situation.

### Retaliate with the Same Weapons; Germany Can Resist "Starvation War"; Intensify Submarine Activities to Disrupt British Shipping; Three British Ships Sunk, Four Escape

### Guida's Article Ridicules Britain; Economic Blockade of Germany Seen as Futile

Rome: Guida, a famous journalist and mouthpiece of the Italian Prime Minister, criticized the British economic blockade of Germany in an article in the Italian Daily today, saying: "Britain not only seeks to isolate Germany spiritually and economically, but also hopes that the German people will rise up and openly rebel against Hitler and the Nazi Party. In Britain's view, this is the least possible outcome. However, they do not know that Germany under the Nazi Party is a unified and disciplined country, deeply imbued with nationalism, and therefore able to engage in Eastern Europe. As for Britain's plan for a three-year economic blockade of Germany, it is purely a fantasy, because Germany's economy can support itself for at least six years. For the past few years, Germany has been seeking economic self-sufficiency and has achieved remarkable results. Furthermore, Germany today is not as isolated as it was in 1914. Germany's recent agreement with the Soviet Union has allowed Germany to enjoy the resources of the Soviet Union. Germany's recent invasion of Poland was nothing more than seeking to connect with Soviet territory, so as to have direct communication with the Soviet Union. Thirdly, the German-occupied areas of Poland are not only rich in raw materials, but also in factories. Therefore, in Guida's view, if Britain and France fight with Germany, it will be a protracted war, and it will not be a win-win situation." (12th Associated Press)

### Eden's Speech: Strike Down National Socialism, Saying Britain is Prepared for a Long War to Create a New World Civilization

London – Dominion Secretary Eden recently delivered a broadcast speech to the United States and the various territories of the British Empire, stating, "Our country is determined to go to war and will never give up halfway. We have no conflict with the German people, but unless National Socialism and its advocated oppression, violence, and betrayal are eradicated from the world, there is no hope of establishing lasting peace. On this point, our will is firm, and there is no room for compromise. Prime Minister Chamberlain once said that our country is not fighting for a distant foreign city's dispute, but to prove that aggressive actions are not profitable. This meaning should be made clear to the leaders of the German National Socialist Party and should be understood by the German people. Their National Socialist government deceives the people, telling them that if Germany can quickly defeat Poland, the democratic countries of Western Europe will sit idly by or even surrender. This is absolutely not true. Our people are already prepared for a long war to ensure that National Socialism can no longer stand in the world. This goal cannot be achieved in a day, and we must fight to the end. This is what the German people should know. Some say that before the outbreak of the European war, if Britain had declared its position earlier, peace could have been maintained. However, before the war, our country had made its attitude clear to the German authorities. In Germany, neither the current government nor future governments should accuse our country of being ambiguous in its attitude. We have tried in every way to persuade Chancellor Hitler to conduct negotiations peacefully. The Polish government has also reluctantly agreed in principle to conduct negotiations. However, Chancellor Hitler insisted on his own views, making negotiations impossible and brazenly engaging in aggression, triggering the war. Britain and France had no choice but to fulfill their mutual assistance obligations to Poland. This obligation was long ago made public to the world by Britain and France. Chancellor Hitler also accused Poland of rejecting Germany's peace proposals. In fact, Poland knew nothing about the so-called proposals. International deception has never been so extreme. Looking back at history, in the past eighty years, the German authorities have used extremely minor incidents as excuses to engage in aggression no fewer than five times. If the current German government can be honest and sincere, it should take these historical facts as a warning and engage in negotiations with countries that are willing to coexist peacefully with Germany and discuss all issues peacefully. Why not do this, but instead continue on the path of hardship, bloodshed, turmoil, and greed? How can this not be painful? As for us, our conscience is clear. Moreover, recalling the lessons of the past, our will is even more firm. We should resolutely go to war without looking back. In short, all political systems based on force cannot last long. National Socialism will also hardly escape the general rule. This war will inevitably lead to widespread devastation in vast areas, and the people of various countries will suffer great pain. However, the main question remains how to make a good aftermath. Can Europe eliminate class barriers and resolve prejudices arising from differences in doctrine? Regarding the divisions of territories, the differences in beliefs, and the barriers of language, and the commercial interests, which were the reasons for the separation of countries in the past, can they be transformed to unite countries with each other? Can the concepts of freedom, tolerance, and benevolence prevail in Europe? All of these cannot be realized as long as National Socialism exists. A new world civilization must be created through a war stage due to Hitler's decision. This is indeed contrary to our wish, but there is still a certain force in the universe that is greater than human power and cannot be resisted. Therefore, no matter what, a new civilization will eventually be created successfully, and at that time, all mankind can hope to have a good opportunity to enjoy freedom," he said.

### Britain Expresses Optimism About the War Against Poland; Göring's Peaceful Atmosphere Unwilling to Consider

London – Well-informed sources here, based on information from various sources, have made a definition of Germany's political stance, saying that the country will put forward peace proposals after the capture of Warsaw. In fact, there is absolutely no need to carry out this plan, because neither the British nor the French government is willing to consider this solution, and the Polish government has clearly declared its determination to fight to the end. As for the situation of the war in Poland, after the German army penetrated deep, its rear transportation is particularly vulnerable. It is currently busy reinforcing the salient positions around Warsaw, which are still in the hands of the Polish army. It is expected that the troops stationed there will automatically withdraw to avoid suffering heavy losses and will establish contact with the main force holding the banks of the Vistula River. If so, then when the German army launches another offensive in a few days, the Polish army will not be difficult to resist. In addition, the saying that Poland is receiving necessary supplies from abroad has been confirmed. Although part of the "strategic triangle" of the Polish military supply center has fallen, most of it has not been occupied by the German army. The Polish military delegation is also in close contact with the British authorities in London and can find ways to make the British and Polish governments maintain greater contact on the eastern front. All these are favorable factors for Poland. (Havas News Agency, 12th)

London – The Ministry of Information recently issued a communique stating, "After German Aviation Minister Göring delivered a speech yesterday, officials here generally believe that German policy has been declared bankrupt. This can be seen from this. Hitler has repeatedly offered promises to other countries, but none have been fulfilled. Therefore, no matter what guarantees he offers, they will not be believed by the world. Britain's insistence that when it makes peace with Germany in the future, it must be with a German government that adheres to its word has ample reason. Not only that, the current German government does not hesitate to deceive the people, telling them that it will be able to achieve 'peace and honor.' In fact, the German government has deliberately pursued a policy of violence, making war inevitable. What peace can there be? The German government's slander of Poland is completely fabricated, which is known to the world. What honor can there be? As Prime Minister Chamberlain himself said, the techniques used by the German authorities are 'revolting.' None of the countries in Europe do not see the policies pursued by the current German government as damaging to that country's honor and endangering the security and independence of all countries. Britain's determination to fight is to restore justice in international relations. No country can be safe until this goal is achieved. The German authorities can claim that they have no ambitions in the West, but the world is already familiar with the country's statements that it has no territorial ambitions and can no longer arouse the slightest confidence. As for Göring's claim that Britain wants to impose a second Treaty of Versailles on Germany and that Britain intends to cause Germany to collapse, we have absolutely no such intention. What we seek is to establish a fair and lasting peace with an honorable German government. As for the economic situation, the German people had already tightened their belts and suffered greatly before the outbreak of the war. Now, hearing Göring's words, they may not be able to gain much comfort. The German people are very aware of the country's economic difficulties. Even Göring himself, although holding an optimistic view, does not deny that the difficulty is that the country's government is actually engaging in unnecessary war under such a serious economic situation. What else can be said?" (Havas dispatch, 11th)

The Hague – The People's Daily here recently commented on the speech given by German Aviation Minister General Göring to workers at a munitions factory yesterday, saying that Germany lacks various resources and therefore fears British propaganda. Göring's speech has awakened German public opinion and initially recognized that "this war will be extremely difficult and will last for a long time." Not only that, the fact that British aircraft have repeatedly flown to Germany and dropped leaflets has caused the leaders of the National Socialist Party to be wary. This can be seen from Göring's speech. General Göring spent fifteen minutes repeatedly explaining the uselessness of British propaganda, which is enough to reflect his inner distress. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

London – Regarding the German-Polish war situation, observers here all say that the Polish army's resistance is very optimistic. The Polish army has suffered few losses after responding to the war, and there is no shortage of military supplies. Therefore, due to these reasons, the German army originally hoped to defeat the Polish army in a few weeks, but it can no longer think of it this way. In addition, after the French army launched an offensive, the German authorities have begun to worry. Furthermore, due to the economic blockade implemented by Britain and France, German commercial shipping, except for a corner of the Baltic Sea, has almost completely disappeared in other parts of the world. If the Polish army only needs to resist strongly until this winter, the impact of the blockade on Germany will become more and more serious, and its position will inevitably become more and more difficult, which can be predicted.

### Slovak Troops Mutiny, Unwilling to Fight Against Poland

Bratislava – Since the outbreak of the European war, conflicts between the Germanic and Slovak residents of Slovakia have repeatedly occurred and have become increasingly serious in recent days. From this, it can be seen that the foreign territories "conquered" and annexed by Germany are not only useless during wartime, but also harmful. On the 4th of this month, a regiment of Slovak soldiers was sent to the Polish border. It was discovered that the officers and soldiers of the regiment mutinied because they were unwilling to fight against Poland. They had to be disarmed, escorted back to this city, and detained. Until the 10th of this month, residents of Raszysdorf Town near this city marched in front of the German authorities, shouting, "We have absolutely no reason to fight for the Germans and their leader." At that time, Germans and Slovaks clashed, and the German army intervened, arresting many Slovaks. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

### Soviet Timber Suspends Shipment to Britain

Oslo – According to news received here, Soviet timber sailing from northern Russian ports to Britain has now been ordered to suspend shipment to Britain and immediately return. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)

### Jiangyin Puppet Magistrate He Peixuan Resigns; Japanese Captain Transferred to North China; Double-Packing Case of the Puppet Tax Bureau

Jiangyin Correspondence: The Japanese army occupies Jiangyin, regarding it as a naval port. Only the towns and villages within the city and along the Chengxi Road are controlled by them. The southeastern villages and the towns west of the county are still under Chinese control. Recently, the Japanese military special team believed that the puppet magistrate He Peixuan was too incompetent and, moreover, since taking office, had brought all his children to work in the puppet county government, receiving salaries, totaling more than two thousand yuan per month. Therefore, they were greatly dissatisfied. After hearing this, He felt ashamed. On the 6th, he secretly went to Suzhou and stayed at the New Suzhou Hotel. On the 7th, he strongly asked the puppet Minister of Civil Affairs, Pan Zhenxiao, to resign. Pan, seeing that there was no one to succeed him, temporarily comforted him. He only returned to Cheng yesterday.

Miyake of the Japanese army was transferred to Cheng last year to serve as the garrison captain, residing in the residence of Wu Tinglu in Delin Lane, East Street. It has been nine months now. Recently, Miyake was ordered to transfer to North China. Zhishiye was appointed as the new captain. Miyake left Cheng at 8:00 AM on the 8th. In the afternoon, Zhishiye's troops were transferred here and still stationed in Wu's residence. Moreover, because there are not many Japanese troops, Liang Xichu of the Third Detachment of the Wuxi Puppet Pacification Army was also transferred to Jiangyin. The puppet's plan to extort is all-encompassing. Since the establishment of the puppet "Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau," Jiangyin has actually become a laughing stock due to a double-packing case. It was found that the puppet "Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Office Changxi District Jiangyin Collection Office" was established first to collect taxes. Later, the puppet "Jiangsu Province Xichangcheng District Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau Jiangyin Collection Office" was also established to collect taxes. One person named Zhu Qing and another named Chen Yi competed with each other based on the order of establishment, each sending staff to merchants to urge payment of taxes, so that the few and far between tobacco and wine shops were like falling into a fog of five miles, at a loss as to what to do. This is also enough to show a glimpse of its disruption.

### Cholera Epidemic in Suzhou; Japanese and Puppets Panic

Suzhou Correspondence: Recently, the autumn heat has turned cool. Cholera vomiting and diarrhea first occurred in the Mucun Township of Suzhou, spreading very quickly. The Japanese and puppets were panicked. They immediately banned the transportation of vegetables out of the area, and then it spread to the Fengmen and Xumen areas. Several people were suffering from cholera every day. The Japanese army was even more anxious. Under the protection of the puppet government, the schools have been ordered to suspend classes for six days. The epidemic is rampant, reaching the city.

### Qingpu: Puppet Officials Intercept Peddlers, Forcibly Demand Tolls

Qingpu Correspondence: Peddlers traveling to and from Qinghu Road, using bicycles to transport firewood, rice, fish, and meat from the countryside, sell them to fellow villagers who have taken refuge in Shanghai, and transport Shanghai cigarettes, candles, soap, etc. to Qing, in order to earn small profits. Unexpectedly, yesterday, they were forcibly detained by the puppet tax card stationed at Bridge No. 16 on that road, claiming that each vehicle must pay a tax of one yuan. It is heard that the peddlers have no cash and cannot pay, so they have not been released as of this morning.

### Key Figures of the Japanese Side in Xiamen: Mito Haruzo and Sawa Shigenobu (Continued)

Naval Faction Overwhelms Xiamen Faction; Xiamen Expert Laboring in Vain

Although the head of the Japanese Military Special Agency in Xiamen is Sawa, the most active one is the head of the Intelligence Department, Sawa Shigenobu. Several years before the fall of Xiamen, Sawa Shigenobu had already come to Xiamen as a special commissioner of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office. The so-called special commissioner is the head of espionage. He supplied the Taiwan Governor-General's Office with information from Xiamen and kept a group of Japanese and Taiwanese under his command. At that time, he was still operating semi-openly and semi-secretly. In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Sawa Shigenobu also served as the president of the Quanmin Daily, the Japanese cultural aggression organ in Fujian, and only then did he openly come forward as a journalist. The Quanmin Daily also became the Japanese intelligence organ stationed in Xiamen. Sawa Shigenobu speaks fluent Xiamen dialect and also speaks very good Mandarin. He is insidious and alert in nature. In the Japanese intelligence department, he is a famous "China expert." Although his scope of activity is not large, his time is almost completely spent in Xiamen, but at least it can be said that he is a "Xiamen expert." He knows everything about Xiamen very clearly. He also fully understands the actions and character of several more prominent people in Xiamen.

Last year, after Xiamen fell, the Japanese side spent a lot of effort in creating a puppet organization. Since Sawa Shigenobu is a "Xiamen expert," the responsibility of searching for puppets fell on his head. He traveled back and forth between Xiamen, Gulangyu, and Hong Kong. He had invited Hong Xiaochun, the president of the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce who was avoiding the war in Hong Kong, three times. In order to show his determination, Hong fled to Annam, which made Sawa Shigenobu feel embarrassed and return to Xiamen in frustration. At this time, Zhang Ming, carrying the Kuomintang Restoration Society signboard, flew from Tokyo to Xiamen. Therefore, Zhang came forward and brought together Zhou Shouqing, Hong Jinghao, and Ma Ma-Huhu to establish the puppet Xiamen Security Maintenance Association on June 20. Although the Japanese side did not look up to these puppets, because there was nowhere else to find them, they had to make do. Last winter, Zhang Ming left, Zhou Shouqing took refuge in Shanghai, and Hong Jinghao fled. The puppet organization almost collapsed. Sawa Shigenobu volunteered again, came forward to search for puppets, and ran around between Xiamen, Gulangyu, Guangdong, and Hong Kong again. After several months of running around, he finally managed to rope in Li Sixian. When he brought this treasure back from Hong Kong, all the key figures on the Japanese side were overjoyed. Li then became the puppet judicial director, then the puppet president, and then the puppet mayor, becoming a living treasure in the hands of the Japanese side in Xiamen.

After the fall of Xiamen, the Quanmin Daily moved over from Jinmen, occupying the Star Light Daily building and all its equipment. Sawa Shigenobu is still the president. In his capacity as a "Xiamen expert," he fabricated various rumors to lure refugees in Gulangyu back to Xiamen and to lure Taiwanese merchants to come to "prosper" Xiamen. Although the Quanmin Daily trumpeted "Xiamen is becoming brighter" and "Xiamen is prosperous" every day, the refugees in Gulangyu refused to be fooled. When Taiwanese businessmen arrived in Xiamen, they saw that the situation was not right and most of them returned on the original ship.

Sawa Shigenobu spends most of his time in Xiamen and is a "meritorious minister" in the Japanese invasion of Xiamen. However, he has also failed several times. At the beginning of the fall of Xiamen, a reporter from a certain newspaper who had not had time to evacuate was captured by the Japanese in Gulangyu. Sawa Shigenobu, with a hypocritical heart, guaranteed him out and supervised him to work at the Quanmin Daily. After more than a month, the reporter finally feigned illness to seek medical treatment in Gulangyu and, under heavy surveillance, escaped to the mainland. Another incident was on April 4 this year, when Sawa Shigenobu came up with the idea of ​​using the Xu Ying Academy to gather all the students of the puppet primary schools in Xiamen to celebrate Children's Day. With the topic of "Celebrating Children's Day for Sino-Japanese Friendship," he ordered the primary school students to write essays. He fully expected to receive many works of praise. Who knew that most of the primary school students handed in blank papers. Among them, three students actually spoke out and cursed, giving Sawa Shigenobu infinite discomfort. (End)

### Financial Hong Kong Group Buying Intent Revives; Cash Reaches the 4,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's cash stock market, initially following the easing of foreign exchange, tended to decline, but then it rose contrarily due to heavy purchases by Hong Kong groups, and ultimately closed at the high point of the day. Generally, retail investors, given the strong digestion of Hong Kong dollars in the past two days, although the price of Japanese gold has risen for two consecutive days, but calculating based on the late closing price of foreign exchange, it is still heavily repressed (English gold is calculated as 1,050 yuan, and the US exchange rate is 5,236 yuan) 1,050 yuan to 1,236 yuan, so most intend to sell out at a good price, so there may be continued increases in the future. When the stock opened, due to the easing of foreign exchange, those entering were hesitant, and it opened at a low price of 3,880 yuan. Then, after the securities group pulled it up, it returned to 3,930 yuan. Once, due to the dumping by the silver shop group, it fell slightly to 3,880 yuan.

At noon, the buying wind slightly subsided, and it closed at 3,930 yuan. In the early afternoon, it was still flat. Soon, due to the revival of buying interest from the Hong Kong group, although some gold shops and silver shop groups had supplies, they still felt that it was a drop in the bucket and could not contain the momentum.

Silver shop ornaments eventually rose by 5 yuan, and the prices of Sino-British pure gold, etc., remained unchanged.

At that time, it was suddenly heard that English gold had risen to four offices, causing the selling wind of retail investors to rise again, and the silver shop group also came to set sell, so it fell back to 3,880 yuan. After that, because the buying wind of the securities group revived, and the money exchange industry and others competed to absorb power, although some gold shops took the opportunity to come out, the position still felt that it was not enough distribution, and the price soared by 70 yuan. The money exchange industry did 20 taels with each other, with the price being 3,950 yuan. Near noon, because the securities group had been watching, and the silver shop group and a certain gold shop continued to throw out, the price fell back by 30 yuan.

The securities group entered the gold shop with 20 taels, with the price being 3,980 yuan. Later, because the silver shop group and others threw out, it fell back by 20 yuan. The silver shop group sold 10 taels to the securities company, with the price being 3,960 yuan. After entering, because the securities group and the money exchange industry re-purchased for the Hong Kong group, although a certain gold shop and silver shop group and retail investors had thrown out, they all took the opportunity to raise the price, causing it to rise sharply by 40 yuan again. The securities group entered the silver shop group, the money exchange industry, and a certain silver shop with a total of 50 taels, with the price being 4,000 yuan, as the late closing price. As a result, compared with the previous day, it had risen sharply by 70 yuan.

Yihua Yarn Factory shares were relatively cold, but Shanghai Yarn Factory shares climbed to a new high of 130 yuan, with buyers at that price at the close. Huidefeng shares also rose sharply, reaching 33.25 yuan, while Steel shares soared to 6.4 jiao, compared to the previous transaction price of only 4.7 jiao. Generally, it is imagined that a certain inherent brewing fact has been discovered for this highly speculative stock.

London, 11th dispatch: Today, the Far East British Company's stocks in the securities market were only opened in small numbers, and the market saw a slight increase. Mercantile Bank shares rose by 5 shillings to 6 pounds 7 shillings 6 pence. HSBC shares remained unchanged, still standing at the original level of 70 pounds.

### Yarn and Cotton: Sales to Customers Became Quiet; Yarn Market Rise Also Leveled Out

The yarn market, which had risen for two consecutive days, saw a significant reduction in current yarn transactions yesterday due to clearing of sales to customers and the departure of ships to other ports. However, industry insiders still held the belief that prices were more likely to rise than fall, so they were unwilling to release the yarn that had been dragged in unless they could make a big profit. Market prices remained in a stable state, but the black market for foreign exchange stood on the horizontal line, and gold was also in a revolving state. The number of new buyers in the market was not as large as in the past. Apart from Shuangma continuing to rise by 20 yuan, other prices were flat.

At the opening of current yarn in the morning, a certain gentleman in the industry came out to raise prices, purchasing Shuangma spot prices at 775 yuan, 10 bales. The market situation was enthusiastic at the time, but Guangdong's Wanxing heard the shouting price very high and suddenly came out to shout sell, only selling 20 Shuangma spot goods for 773 yuan 10 bales, and the market situation immediately flattened. The stack bill price shouted 688 yuan. A short time later, because sales to customers were stagnant, the market outlook turned down, and Shuangma spot prices fell to 765 yuan, and the stack bill price to 675 yuan. The closing slightly improved. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 1,420 bales were traded. The market price of 20 Shuangma rose by 20, with no more. Tiannv didn't move, Shuangdiqiu rose by 5 yuan, Muyang rose by 8 yuan, and Wufu yarn rose by 8 yuan. 395 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left.

### White Cotton Trade Bustled

Market to Rise Again One or Two Yuan

The current cotton trade continues to improve. Chinese factories Shenxin and Yong'an are making large purchases of raw cotton above 20 counts, while other factories are rarely moving. Qingdao Yarn Factory has handled two to three thousand pieces. The local Japanese factory's intake has stagnated, but inter-industry trading is still bustling. White-bag cotton clothing transactions account for the majority, and the market is up by one or two yuan compared to the previous day. The source of Subei cotton is becoming smoother every day. About five to six hundred bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the pier, and another 450 bales came from Beisha. The current cotton situation is listed on the left.

Another message: Due to the increasing difficulty of overseas transportation and the decreasing inventory in Shanghai, all industry insiders are planning to wait for a good price to sell. Therefore, the shouting price of raw cotton is quite high. White Roche cotton, which can only spin 16 counts, is demanding more than 160 yuan. 20-count West Indian cotton is also around 160 yuan because of its inferior color. 30-count Brazilian cotton spot is priced at 202 yuan, 42-count superior white American cotton is priced at more than 230 yuan, and 60-count Egyptian cotton has a team rate increase of 8 percent, combining to more than 340 yuan. These are all new highs since Qing dynasty.

Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was active again yesterday. The opening was still calm, and prices did not fluctuate much. Later, due to the purchase of speculators and the gradual improvement of spot transactions, and the general purchase, the market situation became higher and higher. Until the close, the market price rose by 27 to 8 pounds higher than the previous day. The Indian market was closed yesterday, but the forecast was three rupees higher than yesterday's closing price, and Egyptian cotton was more than 60 pounds.

### Grains: Customer Xian Rice Arrived Continuously; Selling at Reduced Prices

Domi Market Conversely Showed Expensive; Special Tin Glutinous Rice Opened at 42 Yuan

No domi arrived from the river yesterday. Wheel dumplings continued to arrive from various places, more than 4,000 bales, which made thick glutinous rice particularly popular, and shop stomachs were still welcome. As a result, it continued to rise by more than one yuan. However, various old and new jians arrived in an endless stream, and customer vendors had a large amount of goods, and everyone wanted to sell quickly first. Therefore, at the opening of yesterday's market, each jian fell all the way by about two yuan. It was not until near noon that the fall penetrated that the street office was moved. Therefore, the closing situation was already tighter. Special Tin glutinous rice opened at 42 yuan, high-grade goods at 41 yuan to 40 yuan, Su Tong Kun glutinous rice at 40 yuan, 39.7 yuan and 39 yuan, river early and late rice at 35.5 yuan to 34.6 yuan, dumplings at 38.2 yuan to 37.5 yuan, Jiangbei jian initially opened and fell by one yuan, to 26.5 yuan to 26 yuan, later to 25 yuan, Wuhu old jian 26 yuan to 25 yuan, new jian 25.5 yuan to 25 yuan, Jiaxing new Sichuan jian 25.5 yuan, new Yang jian 26.5 yuan to 26 yuan, Gao Tuan jian 28.5 yuan, middle 27.5 yuan to 27 yuan, and Yuan 32 yuan. The city traded more than 5,000 bales.

Customer Xian continued to decline yesterday. Because the source from the north of the Yangtze River was endless, new Xian was also transported by wheel in an endless stream. Old Xian continued to arrive at the port with a total of five to ten bales, and new Jian from the mainland also arrived in the market one after another. The cargo owners sold them in the market at reduced prices in order to sell them all together. Therefore, after the opening price in the morning, it was seen to be going down all the way. As a result, each new and old small seven or eight jiao to one yuan. The Jiangbei new Xian and Jingwu old Xian were only 26 yuan, and the medium and secondary prices were from 25 yuan to about 24 yuan. The old and secondary low-grade goods were only about 23 yuan.

### Factory Flour Rose Again

The Market for Repurchased Goods Settled; Pipe Store Wheat 10.6 Yuan

The current flour factory price has risen by another 0.2 yuan, reaching 7.1 yuan in cash. Each factory is still optimistic and unwilling to supply a large amount. However, the market for repurchased goods was normal again yesterday, still at 7.3 to 4 jiao. Although sales to customers are said to be continuous, the local demand is not very strong. Therefore, the rising trend of repurchased goods has retreated, and some retail investors have released them. The total transaction volume is estimated to be about 50,000 bales. 8,000 bales of flour will be shipped to Hong Kong on the 13th.

Wheat has gradually risen. The source of vehicles and ships is endless. However, cargo owners are increasingly hoarding. Yesterday, the factory and the hoarders gradually pulled in, but the eating plate has been paid more attention. As a result, the market price still rose by one or two corners compared to the previous day. The hoarders handled more than ten cars throughout the market. Fuxin and Fufeng factories jointly handled 12,000 to 3,000 bales. The highest price of pipe store wheat has reached 10.6 yuan. 350 bales of wheat came from Beisha on the 12th.

### Sugar Market: Huizhou White Reached New High Price

Increased About Ten Yuan From Last Weekend

According to the Dutch telegram, the sugar market's clearing price by the local guild was seen to rise again yesterday. Group 24 white original stack spot goods rose by one yuan to 62.3 yuan. Foreign stacks rose by 1.5 yuan to 2 yuan to 62 yuan to 61.5 yuan. Re-export 50 yuan. Taigu car white B mark rose by 3 yuan to 2.5 yuan, initially to 68 yuan, but later retreated to 67.5 yuan. OW mark 67.2 jiao, OX mark 66.9 jiao, DY mark 66.5 jiao, HX mark 66.3 jiao, H mark car red 50 yuan to 48.5 yuan, Dutch red unchanged. Local cotton white rose by one yuan, Zhenji No. 1 62 yuan, Nos. 2, 3, and 4 similar, Local factory No. 1 ice rose by 3 yuan to 70 yuan, Jingming ice 71.5 yuan.

Domestic Huizhou white has been greatly raised due to the shortage of Shantou cotton white. Yesterday, dozens of bales were opened by Guangbang numbers, and they saw a new record of 72 yuan, an increase of about 10 yuan from last weekend.

### North-South Goods: New Peach Kernels Appeared on the Market

The first batch of new peach kernels has arrived in Jinan, 10 baskets. The samples were seen yesterday. The color and luster are still good, but the identity is softer, and the grains are not large. Because it is the first time to see new products, it feels quite rare. Therefore, the opening price reached 140 yuan. In addition, it is rumored that the more than 1,000 pieces of old Haozhou peaches that arrived a few days ago can be opened at only 30 yuan, which is obviously not true. A part of them was opened yesterday, with dried peaches at 55 yuan and ordinary peaches at 40 yuan. A certain firm wanted to buy more and returned 35 or 6 yuan, but the number said that they insisted on 40 yuan.

### Oil Cake: Soybean Oil Transferred to the Interior

Market Continued to Rise by About One Yuan

In the soybean oil market, sales to Hong Kong continued (selling and transporting to Haiphong and then to the interior). The market price of basket oil continued to rise by about one yuan, and barrel oil was involved in a transfer and rise. The total market price opened 50 pieces of Yanzhi oil, 100 pieces of Qingzhi oil, 150 barrels of Dalian oil, 100 barrels of Kobe oil, and 80 barrels of Qingdao oil.

Although 150 pieces of Jiaozhou basket raw oil were handled by the Hong Kong gang, the stomach was not full, and the market price still held the original plate of the weekend (70 yuan). However, due to the lack of inventory, it is difficult to fall.

680 bales of soybeans came from Beisha on the 12th, and 1,840 bales were shipped to Hong Kong on the 13th.

### Hardware: Tinplate Remained Firm and High as Before

In the hardware market, various goods jumped wildly at the beginning of the outbreak of the European War. It was only yesterday that it settled. For example, the original price of nails was 25 yuan, and it soared to 60 yuan. However, the recent opening price is only 56 yuan to 89 yuan, which is softer than before. Your company's horseshoe iron is still rising without falling. The local can factories, toy factories, and printing factories have a good demand. Those who hold the goods are in high spirits, so the opening price is not loose. For example, 200-pound American positive goods are sold for 220 yuan per box, 180-pound American goods are sold for 200 yuan, 200-pound Italian goods are sold for 190 yuan, and 180-pound Italian goods are sold for 180 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Female Color Gang Searched for Clothing Flannel

The female color clothing stores along Simalu are gradually listing their business, and they are searching for various female color flannels that are cheap and of good quality. Yesterday, such as long-haired velvet, short-haired velvet, black, gray, and yellow lambskin, Qini, screw thread, and various overcoat flannels made in Poland were negotiated and sold. Those with strong capital mostly pre-purchased the entire box, but most of them were combined with two or three products, and the majority paid a deposit and limited the time to clear the goods.

### Maintaining Shanghai's Status: U.S. Increases Troops to Shanghai: Sixth Regiment is Crossing the Pacific: Settlement of Shanghai Municipal Council's Negotiations Has Not Yet Materialized: Situation in the Area of ​​Illegal Road Construction in Western Shanghai Has Eased

News from the foreign side: The US government, having received reports from various parties, widely circulated that the Japanese government would take the opportunity during the European War to seize the management rights of the Shanghai concession. On the 9th, Secretary of State Hull summoned the Japanese Ambassador to the US, Kenkichi Horiuchi, at the State Department to issue a warning, declaring that the US government would absolutely not tolerate unilateral Japanese actions to change the status of Shanghai. The wording was as resolute as the previous declaration that it would never allow the abandonment of interests in the Far East. Less than 48 hours after Horiuchi's visit to Secretary of State Hull, the US Treasure Island Radio Station broadcast a shocking message the night before (the 11th), stating that the US Marine Corps Sixth Regiment had been ordered to set off for Shanghai. The details are as follows:

The Sixth Regiment is Already En Route

The Shanghai Times reported that, according to a broadcast message from the Treasure Island Radio Station in San Francisco last night (the 11th), the US government has decided to send the US Marine Corps Sixth Regiment to Shanghai to increase the current US military strength in Shanghai. This is because the Japanese are increasing pressure on the Shanghai Public Concession. The Sixth Regiment is already on board the US ship Langley, crossing the Pacific Ocean to join the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in the city. The US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai is currently preparing barracks to accommodate this increased force. If this statement is true, the US military stationed in Shanghai will double. However, late last night, the headquarters of the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai stated that they had not heard of this action and had not prepared barracks for the Sixth Regiment.

Past Events Make it More Believable

The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that there was a rumor in Shanghai that another US Marine Corps was en route to Shanghai, and the city's radio listeners heard the Treasure Island Radio Station in San Francisco broadcast that the Sixth Regiment had set off for this place, which made it more believable. Although the headquarters of the Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai claimed that they had not heard of this matter, rumors among the officers and soldiers of the Fourth Regiment that the Sixth Regiment had been ordered to reinforce them were not new. According to a similar incident that occurred in 1930. At that time, the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai only had the First and Third Battalions. One day, it was reported that the Second Battalion would be dispatched to Shanghai, and the regiment headquarters denied it. However, two months later, the Second Battalion did arrive in full force. According to historical records, the US Marine Corps Sixth Regiment had previously come to China. When the Fourth Regiment arrived in Shanghai in 1927, the Sixth Regiment went to Tianjin. The pilots, tank soldiers, and artillery of the Tenth Regiment followed. In 1937, the Sixth Regiment returned to the East, with the Tenth Regiment's anti-aircraft guns and heavy machine gun teams. After being stationed in Shanghai for several months, it withdrew in 1938.

Negotiations Between the Two Sides Have Not Yet Approached

Regarding the issue of illegal road construction, the Shanghai Municipal Council did begin negotiations with the Japanese side the day before yesterday. Negotiations are currently underway to find a solution. The opinions of the two sides have not yet approached for a while. Rumors outside that the settlement had already been reached, as evidenced by the statement of the Dada News Agency yesterday, proved to be premature. The rumored settlement plan, which would return the police power of the old illegal road construction to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the police power of the newly built illegal road construction to the pseudo-municipal government, is only the ideal of a few foreigners. Regarding the future of the negotiations, reporters yesterday consulted opinions from various circles in China and abroad. The conclusion reached was mostly pessimistic. As for the directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, they were all unwilling to express their opinions for the time being. According to the articles of the Shanghai Municipal Council, all major administrative events must be discussed and approved by the board of directors. It is now known that the Shanghai Municipal Council has not submitted a report on this matter to the British, American, and Chinese directors, so it is not allowed to be discussed.

The Situation in Western Shanghai Has Eased

Since the 9th, after the Japanese puppets occupied houses and deployed posts in the western section of Jessie Road, Rue Cardinal Mercier, and Bubbling Well Road (west of Haig Road), the situation was very tense at the time, and residents were greatly panicked. However, the actions of the Japanese puppets have not expanded in recent days. Therefore, the situation in the western Shanghai area has eased yesterday. The situation yesterday is divided into the following sections:

Reduced Number of Pseudo Police on Illegal Road Construction

The Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank staff dormitory at 760 Bubbling Well Road was occupied on the 10th. The number of pseudo police stationed in front of the building yesterday was six. In addition, there was one Japanese military policeman. The bank staff were still able to enter and exit and move out their belongings. The number of pseudo police stationed in front of the entrance to the 31st Shelter of the Tzu Lien Society at 11 Jessie Road has been reduced to four, the same as the previous day. As for the Japanese army and pseudo police stationed inside, the number was sometimes large and sometimes small, sometimes a total of thirty or forty people, and sometimes only more than ten people. There were fewer people staying in the shelter at night. Middle school students who were displaced children have resumed classes since yesterday, and the Japanese puppets have not interfered. Pseudo police were no longer seen at the entrance of Diyi Garden at 15 Jessie Road, but a few remained inside.

Restricting Relocation and Checking Pedestrians

The situation in the Kangjiaqiao Jinjia Lane Road Bridge area is still slightly more tense than in other places. The Jinsitufu Temple area in Kangjiaqiao is a concentrated location for pseudo police, with a total of more than 100 people. At the entrances of Siming Villa and Zhongshi New Village on Rue Cardinal Mercier, there were still two pseudo police stationed, the same as the previous day. Residents in the two lanes have been preparing to move out since yesterday, but they must obtain permission from the Japanese military police in advance and obtain a relocation permit before they can avoid being harassed by the pseudo police. Six armed pseudo police are stationed at the entrance of Qianjia Lane, opposite Yuguang Village. Pedestrians entering and exiting at night are often interrogated.

Concession Detectives Patrol as Usual

The red police vehicles in the concession area still patrolled at scheduled times in various places where illegal roads were built, and increased the number of Indian horse patrol teams and motorcycle teams. However, the police detectives on the vehicles no longer searched pedestrians. Although the police vehicles repeatedly drove past the locations where the pseudo police were stationed, no conflicts occurred. However, the police guards at the entrances of the major lanes on Bubbling Well Road have been driven away by the pseudo police and replaced by plainclothes pseudo police to watch. Public buses Nos. 1 and 9 and trolleybuses No. 21 running in the area still operate as usual.

Japanese Soldiers' Actions Sometimes Transgress

It is also learned that the previous night (the 11th), a Japanese military policeman with a command knife stood in the middle of the road near 11 Jessie Road, prohibiting pedestrians from passing through. Vehicles were still allowed to travel as usual, but they all bypassed him. Another Japanese military policeman drove a motorcycle along Rue Pichon past the British Army Headquarters. The vehicle did not have a meeting and did not indicate any identifiable symbols. According to the guarantee provided by Fang Hui to the Shanghai Municipal Council last year, all Japanese military vehicles traveling on the roads of the concession should hang duck egg-style military passes, but the vehicle obviously violated the guarantee.

The Municipality's Attitude Towards Paying Taxes

According to reports, "The Great Way Government is currently making every effort to plan the tax revenue of residents in the area of ​​illegal road construction, seeking ways to seize it. On the evening of the 11th, it aroused serious attention from the Shanghai Municipal Council. According to senior officials, this move by the "Reformed Government" has nothing to do with the Shanghai Municipal Council itself, and the municipality does not pay attention to it. According to the senior official, the tax revenue was initially handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Council and a third party to collect from the residents, so it is not the Shanghai Municipal Council's business. It continued to say that if the residents of illegal road construction submit their taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council, then the Shanghai Municipal Council also has an obligation to fulfill. As for the work of the Shanghai Municipal Council, such as residents refusing to pay taxes, the municipality will cut them off, and at that time, the relationship between the two parties will also be broken. The Shanghai Municipal Council itself, whether before or after the Sino-Japanese War, will enforce various measures. This is called the work of the Shanghai Municipal Council, that is, building roads and laying water pipes in the area of ​​illegal road construction to draw tap water. The establishment of other facilities such as gas, telephones, and electricity has been completed. It also stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council has only received 529,000 yuan in tax revenue from illegal road construction in the six months of this year. If the Shanghai Municipal Council does not

With this income, it does not need to fulfill its obligations to the area, or ask whether the Shanghai Municipal Council feels difficult in collecting taxes in the area of ​​illegal road construction. According to the answer, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, there have indeed been some minor difficulties. Since the 11th, the Japanese military police and "Great Way Government" personnel have been inspecting the shops in the area one by one, which has formed a serious tense state. At present, it has not been confirmed whether the Japanese side and the "Great Way" Municipal Government will inspect the residents of the area. According to another aspect, the various rules for inspecting residents have been revealed. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council, it does not intend to negotiate or discuss with the Japanese side or the "Great Way Government".

### British and French Women in Shanghai Contribute to Their Motherland: British Women's Association Schedules Meeting Today: French Ambassador's Wife Holds Public Meeting Yesterday

The committee of the British Women's Association in Shanghai believes that since the outbreak of the European War and the formal declaration of war against Germany by the country a week ago, it is necessary to express something in order to grasp the nature of women. It has been decided to convene a general meeting of all members at the association's clubhouse at No. 11 Bund this morning to discuss how the British women in Shanghai should contribute to the country and the work plan for the association's service to the war. As for the content of the plan, it has not been announced.

The wife of the French Ambassador, Mrs. Cosme, held the First Determined Women's Congress at the Garden of St. Therese at No. 151 Rue Amiral Bayle at 2:00 pm yesterday to discuss how to knit woolen vests and other items to donate to the soldiers at the front, and stipulated that every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday from 1:00 pm to 6:00 pm will be the meeting date in order to discuss everything at any time. If French expatriates have items to donate, they can be sent to Mrs. Caden at No. 753B23 Haig Road for forwarding.

### The Far East Crisis Intensifies: Important Statements from Shanghai Public Organizations. Telegrams Sent to the U.S. President and Soviet Ambassador, Requesting the Cessation of Aggression and Continued Assistance.

Recently, various important public organizations in Shanghai, due to the outbreak of the European war and the increasingly tense situation in the Far East, jointly telegraphed President Roosevelt of the United States, Secretary of State Hull, and the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to China, Panushkin, expressing China's views. The original telegrams are translated as follows:

Telegram to the U.S. President:

To President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, Washington: Since the outbreak of the European war, the situation in the Far East has become increasingly tense. We urgently appeal to your country to swiftly adopt the most effective measures to sanction the aggressors for taking advantage of the opportunity in the Far East to expand their acts of aggression and to prevent them from continuing to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of third countries, such as maintaining the integrity of customs administration and preserving the status of the Provisional Court. Your noble demeanor in governing your country is fully demonstrated, and we express our deep trust and admiration. We are willing to exert our utmost efforts to be the backing for your country. At the same time, we firmly believe that the friendship between China and the United States will become even more cordial. We hereby send this telegram, hoping for your insightful consideration.

To the Soviet Embassy:

To Ambassador Panushkin of the Soviet Embassy in Chongqing: We have learned of your honorable appointment, and the four million citizens of Shanghai unanimously express their joy and congratulations. At the same time, upon seeing reports of the credentials and speech you presented, we extend our deepest respect. Now that the European war has broken out again and the situation in the Far East is becoming more severe, we request that you relay to your government to continue actively assisting our country and hope that under any circumstances, no compromise will be made with Japan, so that Sino-Soviet relations will become more solid and the cornerstone of Pacific peace can be laid. We respectfully send this telegram of congratulations, hoping for your consideration.

### Extradition of Four Chinese in Tianjin: Responsibility of the British Military Commander. Intense Debate in the Assize Court. Hearings to Continue This Week. The Efficiency Issue of Telegraphic Notification of the Writ of Habeas Corpus.

According to the Continental Times, the four suspects in the Tianjin assassination case have recently been handed over to a court under Japanese control and are in the hands of the Japanese. Regarding the application for a writ of habeas corpus for the four defendants, Jones, the British Assize Court judge in China, issued a writ of habeas corpus earlier this month to Sir Lawrie, the commander of the British garrison in Tianjin responsible for detaining the four defendants. Judge Jones held a hearing on the writ in his office yesterday (the 11th). After a defense lawyer representing the defendant, Sir Lawrie, raised an objection, Judge Jones adjourned the hearing, which will continue this week. The lawyer for the four Chinese plaintiffs is Jones from the Ellis & Hays law firm in this city. Mr. Jones argued yesterday that Sir Lawrie, knowing that the British Assize Court here had issued a writ of habeas corpus, handed over the suspects, which was contempt of court. Although Sir Lawrie had not actually received the writ when he carried out the extradition, the decision to issue the writ had been telegraphed to Sir Lawrie in advance. The defense lawyer, Mr. Preswitt, noticed that a certain necessary affidavit issued in Tianjin had not arrived in Shanghai and requested an adjournment of the hearing. He also objected, arguing that if Sir Lawrie had not personally received the writ, his actions did not constitute contempt of court, and that the writ was remedial rather than punitive. Mr. Preswitt was representing Sir Lawrie and not the government. Although Sir Lawrie had received orders from the government to hand over the four defendants, if the suspects' lawyer proved that the telegraphic notification of the court's decision had the same effect as a mailed order, then Sir Lawrie would be personally responsible for the extradition of the four defendants. When personnel at the British Embassy here heard on the first of this month that the British Assize Court had issued a writ of habeas corpus, they expressed the view that the legal authority over the suspects rested with the administrative organs of the British concession, not the commander of the British garrison.

### Authorities in the Two Concessions Set a Date for Preparedness. Assemblies Prohibited Starting Today.

The police authorities in the two concessions have decided to continue to adopt joint precautionary measures for the "September 18th" anniversary. Emergency measures will be implemented starting on the 16th of this month. Assemblies, associations, parades, and other activities will be prohibited starting on the 13th. At that time, non-essential roads and alleys at the junction of the British and French concessions will be blocked, following the "July 7th" anniversary measures. All police personnel and national defense forces will be deployed for guard duty. Furthermore, all circles in this city maintain a calm attitude towards the eighth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident and will not make any formal demonstrations.

### 400 Jewish Refugees Arrived Yesterday.

According to the English-language China Press, another group of 400 European Jewish refugees arrived in Shanghai aboard the Italian liner Conte Biancamano. Representatives from the European Jewish Refugee Committee met them at the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf and sent them to various places of accommodation. The Japanese, the French Concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Jewish authorities organized a special refugee committee last month to regulate the entry of Jewish refugees into Shanghai. It was decided that refugees who had already started their journey or purchased tickets when the committee was established would be allowed to come to Shanghai. At that time, there were a thousand immigrants who had already purchased tickets to come to Shanghai, including 200 on the Japanese ship Hakozan Maru (transliteration), 150 on the French ship Athos II, 500 on the German ship Potsdam, and 400 on the Italian ship Conte Biancamano. Therefore, the 400 refugees aboard the Italian ship that arrived in Shanghai today can freely disembark. The German ship Potsdam suspended its voyages after the outbreak of the European war, and the immigrants who had purchased tickets for that ship were unable to travel. It is reported that the Hakozan Maru is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month.

### Japanese Warships Gather in Southern Huangpu.

The Jiangsu Provincial Security Forces of the Chinese side have been dispatched to the areas near Minhang along the Huangpu River estuary and Longhua Bay. All the puppet troops have defected and made contact with the mobile units in the Songjiang area. Therefore, the Japanese naval and land forces have been on alert in the vicinity. However, on the opposite bank, the guerrilla forces in the towns of Zhanggang, Duxing, and Tangkou in Punan have been responding to this side. For precautionary purposes, the Japanese have gathered five warships, adopting a vigilant posture.

### President Kong's Birthday Celebrations Diverted to Relief Efforts.

September 19th of this year is President Kong's 60th birthday. He has firmly refused any gifts from relatives and friends. Some people here have initiated a plan to divert the birthday gifts prepared by everyone to relief efforts, and all gifts will be handed over to the Central Bank in this city for collection. Those from all walks of life who are willing to join can send their gifts before the birthday, so that they can be collected and transferred.

### Navigation to Eastern Zhejiang Reopened. The "Heda" Joins the Shanghai-Ningbo Route. Voyages to Wenzhou are Still Experimental.

Navigation to Eastern Zhejiang has been restricted for a long time. Now, with the permission of the authorities, ports have been opened to allow ships to dock, and import and export goods inspection stations have been established. However, ships that have not been approved in advance are absolutely not allowed to pass. Dangerous defensive materials have been deployed at the river mouth, and pilots must be dispatched by the authorities.

There are a total of seven ships sailing the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Except for the Taikoo Shipping's Yingzhou, which does not carry passengers, only six ships can take passengers. Among them, the future of the three German-flagged ships continuing to sail is currently uncertain. The Moufu is waiting in Zhenhai to load cargo and may be able to return to Shanghai today. The company had no news yesterday. It is claimed that it will definitely return to Shanghai within the next two days. The Far Eastern Company's Hana is slightly delayed in returning to Shanghai because the loading and unloading of goods in Zhenhai Port must be carried out in sequence. The American company, Wei Li Han's Xinanna, used to sail the Shanghai-Tianjin line, but now, due to the severe flooding in Tianjin, navigation is difficult, so it has been changed to the Shanghai-Ningbo line. It is scheduled to clear customs today (the 13th) and set sail for Ningbo at dawn tomorrow, at the same time as the Zhongyi Company's Ende. Furthermore, the Norwegian company Heda recently brought cheap Yang rice from Saigon to Shanghai. Now that unloading has been completed, it is said that it is now managed by the Zhongyi Company and has joined the Shanghai-Ningbo route. It is scheduled to clear customs on the 15th and set sail for Zhenhai on the morning of the 16th. The company has telegraphed Ningbo to handle all the procedures and is expected to obtain approval. Although the Shanghai-Wenzhou route already has the Xixiangtai, which sailed to Wenzhou the day before yesterday (the 10th), followed by Yilong's Shenfu and Huatai's Xinantong, all of which are scheduled to sail to Wenzhou today, they are all experimental voyages, only loading cargo and not taking passengers. As for passengers and cargo from Ningbo to Zhenhai, they are all transported by small boats. The Yinxian Shipping Association has now stipulated the fare for passengers transferring to small boats: from Ningbo to the anchorage outside the blockade line, 70 cents per person; to the anchorage on the Yunshan waters outside the port, one yuan per person; and to the anchorage on the Ligang waters, 1.30 yuan per person.

### American Residents in Yantai Suffer Badly: Frequent Searches by Japanese Troops, Even the American Consulate is Not Spared.

According to the Continental Times, a visitor from Yantai reported yesterday (the 11th) that American residents in Yantai have been repeatedly searched by the Japanese military authorities. Even the American Consul stationed in Yantai has not been spared. The Japanese are attempting to severely restrict all financial transactions and withdrawals, and have sent troops to station themselves in the major foreign banks in Yantai. Anyone entering or leaving the bank, regardless of who they are, is inspected, especially those entering and leaving HSBC. On the first of this month, the American Consul himself was also inspected. The American Consulate in Shanghai has not been able to confirm this statement, but it acknowledges that consulate officials report such incidents directly to the American Embassy in Beiping. This kind of news only reaches Shanghai indirectly.

According to the Continental Times, Mr. Hein, the chairman of the European Refugee Committee, stated yesterday (the 11th) that British companies here will, at least for the time being, not apply the British government's regulations prohibiting British citizens from trading with the enemy to German Jewish refugees they employ. The British Consul-General, Mr. Phillips, has asked him to announce to British landlords and personnel of British companies that those who wish to dismiss German Jewish tenants or employees should consult with the British Consulate first. It is now believed that the issue of the special status of German refugees here has been submitted to the London authorities for a decision. The British Consul-General is awaiting a reply and is organizing a special committee to study and answer inquiries about the current status of refugees.

### Cheap Rice Sales About to Begin: Rice Prices Expected to Fall. Tribute Rice Distribution on Schedule; Rice Registration Extended.

In recent days, the number of rice and grain shipments from Jiangbei to Shanghai has been increasing daily, with the total amount reaching 8,455 bags, including 270 piculs from the inland river. Market prices have weakened due to the abundance of goods. Indica rice has fallen back by one yuan, with Jiangbei indica selling for 35 yuan and Wu indica selling for 33.8 yuan. Japonica rice is still between 36 and 40 yuan. However, due to the impending cheap rice sales, sales volume is low. According to news from the rice market, after the authorities implement cheap rice sales, rice prices are expected to fall back.

In addition, the distribution of tribute rice has been scheduled for five districts. Because of the need to build reed sheds, the construction cost for each location is more than a hundred yuan, and the construction is currently being undertaken by the Engineering Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The temporary staff hired at the distribution locations also aim to serve as volunteers. As for the date of the start of the distribution, the earliest could be this Saturday (the 16th), but at the latest, it can be started by next Monday (the 18th). Furthermore, the registration for ordering foreign rice by the Accountants' Association was originally scheduled to close today. Because some of the registration forms requested by various sectors have not yet been filled out and submitted, the association has specifically decided to extend the deadline for several days, urging everyone to submit them as soon as possible so that a meeting of the subscribers can be convened to decide on all procedures.

It is reported that the encoffining ceremony will be held at 2:00 PM on the 13th at the Chinese Funeral Home on Haig Road.

### Public Organizations Jointly Write to the Courts, Urging Them to Stop Unwarranted Rent Increases. Citizens Already Feel Like They are in Dire Straits; Unwarranted Rent Increases Will Further Affect People's Livelihoods and Order.

Yesterday, various public parks in this city jointly sent letters to the First Special District Court of Shanghai, the Second Special District Court, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, and the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court. The letters stated: "Respectfully submitted, since the westward shift of the war, Shanghai has become an isolated island. Over the past two years, the number of people seeking refuge here has been increasing daily, resulting in a distorted development in a special situation. However, while there are not a few people with assets who have great vision, engage in great operations, and seek welfare for the local area, the majority are those who only seek their own private interests and disregard public peace. These people recklessly purchase foreign exchange with their capital and manipulate and hoard goods, causing prices to soar. As a result, society is in a precarious state of unrest. The general public is experiencing tremendous pressure on the three major elements of life: clothing, food, and housing, leading to serious problems. The cost of clothing and food has increased many times over, and ordinary people in the middle and lower classes are largely unable to maintain their livelihoods. The housing problem is even more complex, with disputes arising frequently everywhere. Landlords, without a sense of righteousness and only knowing how to profit from the national crisis, not only rent out all their vacant houses but still think it is not enough, and often take the initiative to increase rents on unwarranted grounds. They are also aware that increasing rents at this time is not in accordance with the law, so they threaten to renovate or take back the property for their own use, or to cut off water and electricity. Even more abhorrently, they threaten to order the removal of additional structures built on the original leased property years or decades ago, or to alter the structures. All kinds of oppression are endless. As a result, lawsuits are often heard. However, the pretexts for these lawsuits are all aimed at increasing rents. The public organizations are well aware that many residents in the middle and lower classes of Shanghai have made internal alterations and additions to their homes, and even more so for shops, due to various renovation needs. If rent increases are not based on legal provisions but are based on threats of relocation, renovation, and removal of additional structures to achieve their goals, then the example will be followed everywhere, and disputes will increase. The public organizations believe that the occurrence of such events is of great concern to the people's livelihoods and the stability and order of the local area and should be given serious consideration and close attention. They know that the justices of your court are aware of the people's plight and are working to benefit the common people, and will not be deceived by these greedy people. Moreover, the public organizations highly respect the spirit of judicial independence and would never dare to initiate any interference. However, the millions of people in the two concessions of Shanghai are already in dire straits in this current environment. What they feel is a crisis, and it is difficult to remain silent. Moreover, the public organizations are also national organizations and bear the responsibility of maintaining local stability and public morale. Therefore, we venture to offer this advice in the hope that it will be adopted. Please pay attention to lawsuits regarding housing issues and render fair judgments in accordance with the law, so that landlords will not be allowed to use coercive means to achieve the purpose of increasing rents. Then, we will not be able to help but offer our sincere prayers. We earnestly submit this appeal, hoping for your consideration."

### Applications for Certificates of National Goods Require Certification from the Chamber of Commerce. Certifications from Other Organizations are Invalid.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce recently received a notice from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating, "The Ministry's issuance of certificates of national goods aims to commend the products of national factories, which is extremely important. When Shanghai manufacturers apply for certificates, the organizations certifying the matter at the end of the application form have now been re-specified by the Ministry. Hereafter, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce will affix its official seal and have the responsible person sign and certify it in order to ensure uniformity. Certifications from all other organizations will be considered invalid. This notice is hereby issued for your information and to instruct all factories to comply. Special notice is hereby given."

### High Tide Tomorrow Morning: The Moon Approaching, Great Attraction.

According to predictions by the Zhaopu Bureau, 2:00 AM tomorrow, the 13th, will be the time when the moon releases the earth, with great attraction. On that day, there will be a high tide in the Huangpu River at midnight, reaching between eleven feet and eight inches, only one foot more than the Bund embankment. The torrents will gurgle, and there will be a risk of overflowing the embankment. From then on, there will be continuous high tides in the Huangpu River, with the highest tides on the mornings and afternoons of the 15th, all above twelve feet, lasting until the 19th. At that time, low-lying roads will once again be greatly troubled by flooding. Around the 20th, the water level is expected to return to normal. However, there will still be large tides after the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar.

### Norwegian Traveler Describes His Experiences in Siberia: Soviet Military Vehicles Constantly Heading East, Germans Deeply Regret the War.

According to the North-China Daily News, a Norwegian traveler who had just arrived in Shanghai via Siberia from London told a reporter yesterday (the 11th) that the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" are continuing to make rapid military preparations. Within the Soviet Union, hundreds of trains are transporting back and forth. We were delayed eighteen hours in Omsk because the train we were on repeatedly stopped at side tracks to wait for ammunition transport vehicles to pass us first. Trucks and trailers were transported in open freight cars, and tanks were covered with tarpaulins. Airplanes were packed in large wooden boxes, also covered with tarpaulins. Every ten minutes, a line of empty trains from the east passed us. It was clear that there were not enough locomotives, so each locomotive had to haul as many as eighty freight cars. Many hours before arriving at the "Manchu" border, train personnel entered each cabin and forced us to close the blinds. The Japanese authorities in "Manchu" also did this, but sometimes they only closed the blinds on one side, mainly to prevent us from seeing the airfield. The windows were not reopened until we reached Harbin. The traveler described what he saw in Germany and Poland, saying that when he passed through these two countries, the people were quite peaceful and life seemed normal. In Berlin, because he was a foreigner, he was supplied with whatever he wanted to eat. He traveled across Siberia with four Germans, who compared the quality of the butter used for the passengers' breakfast on the train with the butter that the German people received each week. He passed through Berlin on August 24th. The people there did not believe that war was coming. Those who traveled with him thought that even if war broke out, Britain would not fight. During his day in Berlin, all the Germans he met told him that they deeply regretted the idea of war. The situation in Britain was different. The people were very enthusiastic and obedient to the instructions issued by the authorities. There was no shortage of food, and life proceeded as usual.

### Female Spy Jiang Peiyu Executed in Zhejiang.

Executed in a Certain Location. According to a statement issued by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Jiang Peiyu (also known as Jiang Qinbin, Wang Jiangshi, and using the alias Zhang Suzhen) was introduced to a certain party in Shanghai, and then introduced to a special agent organization stationed in Shanghai. The organization gave Jiang Peiyu 500 yuan in activity funds to conduct activities in Zhejiang. Jiang left Shanghai for Zhejiang on March 25th of this year, staying at Zhang Mingyan's home at No. 31 Shanting Street, Huangyan. She instructed Zhang to contact the Huangyan County Resistance and Defense Team and ordered him to draw a detailed map of Zhejiang Province to contribute to a certain party. She also instructed Liang Houshi to find a pilot to guide a certain party. The authorities discovered the matter and secretly arrested Jiang Peiyu and sent her to the Provincial Security Command for interrogation. After questioning, it was confirmed that Jiang Peiyu had dared to resist her own country during this period of resistance against Japan, which was extremely illegal. She was sentenced to death in accordance with the law and has been executed by firing squad at a certain execution ground to serve as a warning and to be widely publicized.

### After Hotels Increased Room Rates, Employees Demand Pay Raises.

Since the hotel industry in this city increased room rates by 20% on September 1st, the employees of various hotels, because the management has not increased their salaries, find it difficult to maintain their livelihoods with their original income. Therefore, they demand a 30% pay raise, following the example of restaurants and eateries. Hotel employees are divided into two types: those who are paid a fixed wage and those who split profits. Those who are paid a fixed wage usually pay a deposit of 200-300 yuan, and their salary is only 30 yuan at most. Those who split profits add a small percentage to their accounts and split the profits with the management at a ratio of 40% to 60%, or half and half, but even then, they earn no more than 40 yuan. Now that the management has increased room rates, it is reasonable to raise the salaries of the employees as well. The management is discussing this matter in order to make a decision.

### German Resident's Murder of His Mistress: Forensic Appraisal Shows the Perpetrator Exhibited Signs of Neurasthenia.

The case of German resident Heinemann, who killed his mistress, Miss Fashang (transliteration), with a razor on June 12th of this year due to a love affair, was investigated by the French Police and transferred to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for prosecution on charges of murder. After repeated trials by Judge Liao, the defendant initially confessed to the crime but then denied his statements. He was ordered to be returned to custody, and the investigation was rescheduled. Now, it is learned that during the rescheduling, a forensic appraisal revealed that the criminal, Heinemann, exhibited signs of neurasthenia. Yesterday, Judge Liao continued the trial of the case and ordered the defendant to be transferred to the detention center to await the submission of an examination report from the doctor hired by the defendant to the court before the trial is resumed.

### Overview of Public Parks in the Public Concession.

Last month, summer and autumn flowers were planted in the Shanghai Municipal Council's parks and squares. A total of 1,301,066 branches of flowers and trees were transferred from the Shanghai Municipal Council's nursery to the various parks and squares. A green parrot was donated to the Zhaofeng Park Zoo by Mr. Brown, a Westerner. In addition, several other birds and animals were received. The daily work in the parks mainly consisted of park maintenance, such as grooming the lawns and repairing bamboo fences. There were many applications to use the sports grounds in various parks for various ball games. There were 3,020 people in Jiaozhou Park, 7,340 people in Hongkou Park, and many flowers, trees, bamboo fences, and roadside trees in Huishan Park were damaged by the wind and needed to be repaired. The total number of visitors to the parks last month was 282,953.

### Silk Goods Internal Sales Turn Prosperous; Silk Stores Join the Guild; Issuance of Internal Sales Certificates Is Extremely Cautious; Hundreds of Cases Are Handled Daily

Since the start of the military conflict, various places have successively become war zones, and various seaports have been blockaded, resulting in the interruption of domestic sales of national goods. Furthermore, the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulates that all national goods transported to the interior for sale must be accompanied by a certificate issued by the local chamber of commerce or trade association before they are allowed to be imported. The Shanghai silk industry trade association has more than 500 members, with the highest capital of 300,000 yuan and the lowest being more than 200 yuan. Most are concentrated in the central district, engaging in retail and wholesale. Due to the impact of the war, business has been quite sluggish. Now, due to the prosperous internal sales, such as the southwestern provinces, transported via coastal defense, and the various cities and counties along the two railways of Jinghu and Huhangyong, the large and small silk stores in Shanghai urgently need to transport goods to the interior. Therefore, they are importing goods in large quantities, waiting for the opportunity to transport them. However, all silk stores that transport goods to the interior must hold a certificate from the trade association, as well as the seal of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. In order to develop internal sales, the silk stores have been clamoring to join the guild and pay membership fees. Yesterday, inquiries with the Shanghai Silk Industry Trade Association revealed that the association issues hundreds of various certificates to members every day. Furthermore, for the sake of prudence, personnel are dispatched to investigate before issuing them, which are then sent to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for stamping and the signature of the person in charge.

### The Murder Case of Father An; Brought to Court for Interrogation Yesterday; Five Perpetrators, the Main Culprit Still at Large

Father An, a French national and the director of the orphanage established by the Catholic Church in Tushanwan, Xujiahui, Shanghai, was suddenly murdered by bandits on the 30th of last month. The perpetrators fled the scene. After the incident, the French police ordered all detectives to solve the case within a limited time, arrest the criminals, and punish them to the fullest extent of the law. Now, on the afternoon of the 9th of this month at 9:00 PM, Ju Bolu (25 years old), an accomplice of the perpetrators from Pudong, knowing that his crime was inescapable, surrendered himself to the St. Peter's Catholic Church at the intersection of Rue Luberan and Father Lou Road. The church notified the Lujiawan Central Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest and detain Ju for further investigation. The details have already been recorded in this newspaper. Now, it is heard that during the police interrogation, Ju Bolu confessed that at the age of eight, he entered the Tushanwan Catholic Church orphanage to learn a craft. Until recently, two months ago, he was expelled by the orphanage for laziness. On the 30th of last month, he and A, B, C, and D (names kept confidential), five people in total, went to the orphanage intending to rob money. While B, C, and D were on lookout outside, he and A entered Father An's bedroom, pretending to ask Father An if he could take in an orphan who would be brought in the next day. Taking the opportunity, A made a move and strangled Father An. He held down An's feet and tied them with rope, stuffing cotton in his mouth. They also intended to open the iron box to steal money, but they failed. They then opened the writing desk drawer and took 200 yuan in cash, most of which was taken by A. Then he and A fled together to the Hengwu area of Pudong. It happened to be raining heavily. In the dark night, they stayed overnight in a cowshed. The next day, he decided to return to Shanghai. He stayed in a inn for a few days. Thinking that he still had a wife, children, and elderly at home, and that he could no longer live that way, he went to the church to surrender himself. Currently, A is still in the Hengwu area, and so on. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Ju to the First Criminal Tribunal of the Special Second Court. Judge Liao interrogated him. Yao, a lawyer from the French Concession administrative authorities, presented the case and stated that the accomplices still at large need to be arrested and requested a postponement for further investigation. Interrogating Ju, he admitted to participating in the murder of Father An. The court verified the confession and ordered a change of date for further questioning on the 30th of this month. The defendant was sent back to detention.

### Japanese Arrest Travelers at the Da Fang Hotel; Two Travelers Are Now Detained in the French Police Station

At around 7:00 PM last night, two plainclothes Japanese people suddenly came to the Da Fang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession and barged into rooms 157 and 159. They intended to forcibly arrest Li Rong in room 157 and Zhang Xinqiang in room 159. The hotel staff called the nearby patrol police, and both parties were taken to the police station. After a detailed interrogation by the chief, the two Japanese people claimed that Li and Zhang had just come here from a certain remote area and intended to engage in certain activities in Shanghai. They were ordered by their superiors to secretly arrest them. After hearing this, the chief asked the two Japanese people to provide evidence of Li and Zhang's crimes. The two Japanese people were ultimately unable to provide any. Currently, Li and Zhang can only be temporarily detained in the police station for further investigation.

### Forging Voucher Coupons; Three Years Imprisonment

Huang Hongquan, a Ningbo native who set up a cigarette stall on Qiwu Pulu in Hongkou, took the opportunity to entrust the Yongfeng Printing House at 701 Haining Road to print 10,000 forged one-cent voucher coupons for the Datong Fish Shop on Qiwu Pulu, 10,000 two-cent voucher coupons for the Jintai Fish Shop, and 5,000 one-cent voucher coupons, which were mixed and used in the market. The two fish shops found out the day before yesterday and reported it to the Yulin Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Huang Hongquan and take him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted him according to the law. The defendant admitted to the forgery without denying. The presiding judge verified the confession and sentenced Huang Hongquan to three years of imprisonment for forging securities. The six forged zinc plates and one forged stamp were all confiscated.

### The Second Landlord; Accused of Assault; Reached a Settlement as Ordered

Zhu Suzhen, a woman from Suzhou, 25 years old, rented a pavilion room in the Friendship Women's Apartment at 8 Xingfu Lane, Rue Luberan. She entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Tribunal of the Special Second Court against the second landlord, Sun Zhang (51 years old, local) and her daughter, Sun Shiying (23 years old), for joint assault, requesting an investigation. It is claimed that the plaintiff rented the defendant's pavilion room. The rent had recently been increased by two yuan, totaling sixteen yuan. Now, they suddenly wanted to increase the rent by another two yuan. At 11:00 AM on the 4th of this month, the first defendant urged the collection of the rent for September, demanding that the newly added two yuan be paid together. At that time, the plaintiff refused, arguing that the first landlord had not increased the rent and the second landlord should not increase it without reason. The defendant then said that if she refused, she should move out immediately, otherwise she would lock the door. The plaintiff then wanted to call her husband, but the first defendant did not allow her to make the call, leading to a dispute. She was injured in the arm by being hit with the telephone receiver. The second defendant even stepped forward to help, requesting an investigation according to the law. According to the complaint, the court held a hearing yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Jiang. The plaintiff arrived with her lawyer and gave her statement. The defendants also arrived with their defense lawyers, Fan Gang and Yu Enliang. The first defendant admitted to the assault, stating that the reason was a dispute over the phone call, and that she was kicked in the abdomen. The second defendant also admitted to helping. They also filed a counterclaim for false accusation and assault. The court verified the confession and, considering the minor nature of the case, persuaded them to reach a settlement. The defendants apologized to the plaintiff. With the consent of both parties, a settlement was reached, and the respective lawsuits and counterclaims were withdrawn.

### Group of Suicides

Qian Amao: Qian Amao, a native of Gusu, 31 years old, a lacquer worker, resided at 840 Gordon Road in western Shanghai. Due to economic pressure, he ingested poison last night at around 8:20 PM and committed suicide. After being reported to the police, he was taken to Baolong Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and he soon died.

Wang Shuxing: Wang Shuxing, a native of Shaoxing, 34 years old, recently stayed with his fellow villager Yao Amao at 44 Xing Shun North Lane, Remi Road. Due to unemployment and difficult living conditions, he had a moment of despair. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, he jumped off the roof of Yao's house and committed suicide, suffering internal injuries and breaking both arms and legs. He died on the spot.

Wang Zugen: Wang Zugen, a traveler from Jiangsu, 23 years old, was staying in room 217 of the Great Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road. Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, a tea server discovered that he had taken sleeping pills and committed suicide. An ambulance was quickly called to rush him to Renji Hospital for treatment. The poisoning was severe, and his life was in danger.

Zhu Zhengsheng: Zhu Zhengsheng, a resident of 156, Lane 1238, Annan Road, suddenly had an argument with his wife over trivial family matters yesterday morning at around 1:00 AM. Afterward, Zhu secretly ingested poisonous liquid and committed suicide. After being discovered by his family, he was rushed to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. His life was in critical condition.

Zhou Zhao: Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, an old woman, Zhou Zhao, 58 years old, at 24 Yongshun Road, Broadway Road, in eastern Shanghai, suffered an unknown stimulus and suddenly had a desire to end her life.

### Persuading to Purchase Cotton Yarn for Profit; Defrauding Huge Sums of Money; The Yang Brothers Are Blinded by Greed; Discovered the Fraud and Filed a Criminal Lawsuit

Yang Xingling, Yuling, and Changling, three brothers from Wuxi, residing at 11, Lane 340, Yucha Qing Road, were repeatedly persuaded by Yin Renyi, who lived with them, to invest in the cotton yarn business, saying that the price of yarn was rising daily and profits would be high. The Yang brothers were swayed by this. On July 21st, they raised 1,500 yuan and entrusted Yin to purchase three pieces of yarn. Soon, Yin settled the accounts with them, making a double profit. Since then, they trusted Yin even more. Therefore, in a few days, Yin colluded with Liu Yongzhi of the Xinguang Dyeing and Weaving Factory at 42 Naxiangfen Lane and Hong Shenfu, who lived on the third floor of the Huimin Elementary School in Hongruili, Wenzhou Road, to use tricks and gradually obtain more than 20,000 yuan from the Yang brothers as the price of purchasing yarn and cloth. The profits and losses were initially settled every night. However, the Yang brothers were reaping huge profits and never suffered any losses. Until near the anniversary of August 13th, Yin suddenly used the excuse of martial law and the inability to pick up goods from the warehouse to stop settling accounts. The 15,000 yuan check from Shenfu Cotton Cloth Store was also found to have no deposit. It was then suspected that Yin and others were actually colluding with each other, using profit as bait at first, and then defrauding them of huge sums of money. The Yang brothers, having failed to negotiate with these people, have now hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Yin Renyi, Liu Yongzhi, Hong Shenfu, and others in the First Special District Local Court, recounting the facts in detail. In addition to the 10,125 yuan of profits that have been gradually recovered, there is still a shortage of 12,565 yuan, which clearly violates Article 339, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, requesting that the case be summoned and punished. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng summoned them for questioning. The defendant Yin Renyi failed to appear. Liu and others also hired lawyers to defend themselves. After the court interrogated them, it ordered a change of date for further questioning.

### Potassium Cyanide Tipped into Rice; Cook Almost Poisoned to Death; Fortunately, the Maid Discovered It and Averted the Disaster; Zhao Changjin Was Arrested and the Admonition Was Changed to a Later Date

Zhao Changjin (18 years old), a native of Yangzhou, worked as a partner in the Wubaokang Electrical Material Store at 18 Haikou Road. The relationship between the guest and the host was very good. For some reason, the day before yesterday at 4 pm, Zhao took advantage of the maid's lack of preparedness and secretly poured a bottle of poisonous potassium cyanide into the rice, intending to poison his master and all 31 staff members of the store. Fortunately, the maid Qu Wu discovered it and reported it to the owner who turned him over to the police station. This morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Tribunal of the Special Court and requested to be detained. Judge Feng presided over the court interrogation. The defendant confessed that he had no hatred with the owner and was really because his head was not clear, and muddledly poured the poisonous salt into the rice, asking the court president to be lenient. The court verified the confession and instructed that the case be adjourned for seven days for further questioning. The defendant will be examined by the court's forensic doctor to determine if he suffers from mental illness during the change of date. Sports News

### West League Football This Season; Interest Will Sharply Decline

French merchants are difficult to form a team… The British army does not participate; each team is average… The annual meeting will be held tomorrow.

The curtain of the Shanghai football season has been unveiled last week. This week, there will be a battle between Donghua and St. Francis, which will not be slightly paused due to the war in Europe. The Shanghai Western Football Association has scheduled the annual meeting to be held at 5:15 PM tomorrow (Thursday) at the Shanghai Engineering Office General Assembly Hall at 220 Sichuan Road, to re-elect officials, and for other valley affairs. Although it has been decided that the league this season will proceed as usual, it has at least been affected to some extent. In terms of Group A, I am afraid that there will not be more than eight teams. Lido and Beixi Tong are still to be passed. The British army only has one team, Xifu Si, registered, but there are still problems with whether it can play. Withdrawing from the league is extremely likely. Some members of the French merchants will be conscripted. After all kinds of efforts, it is difficult to form a team. It is said that they will give up Group A, or form a team to participate in Group B, or Group C. As for the Russian generals among them, such as Robas Tofu, Shaker is quite ambitious to pull them into the team to reorganize. Whether Lido can cross-level is still uncertain. Donghua is mostly to promote new talents. Only Chen Hongguang has returned, and the rest of the Western teams, the Western Police, Portugal, and St. Francis are still the same, and are average. The Shanghai football scene can still be active. In order to imitate the complete suspension of the London Church, the fans can just have fun in the lack of ways.

### Finland Still Determined to Host Next Year's World Games

(Haitong News Agency, Fenjing, 12th) Pihahe, a famous Finnish sports leader, issued a statement yesterday, forcefully saying that even if the European war is prolonged, the 1940 World Games should still be held as usual. Kelka, the director of the information office of the World Games Preparatory Committee, also issued a statement, denying the rumors that the office had laid off employees, forcefully saying that the work of the office is proceeding as usual. Frenkel, the chairman of the Fenjing Olympic Pairing Committee, also said that all World Games buildings can be completed on schedule, but the construction cost of the swimming pool, 32 million marks, is still subject to the approval of the Fenjing City Council.

### Handicap Tennis Charity Performance; Postponed for One Week

The Handicap Tennis Championship, since it was decided that the Group A finals will be expanded into a charity performance, was originally scheduled to be held on the 16th and 17th of this month. Now, because it takes time to build the grandstand, and the invited masters have to participate in the grass court semi-finals at the end of this week, it has been decided to postpone it for one week, and it will be held on the 23rd and 24th of this month. Although the ticket price is high, the results are very good due to the efforts of Chen Qihao and his brother Qi Jun to promote sales, and it has exceeded 1,000 yuan. The Refugee Association sent a letter to Gao Huaide, the president of the Lido Sports Association, to give a prize. Mrs. Buli Sheng auctioned the balls, Mrs. Qiu Maosheng cut the ribbon, and the Lido Cup donated by the Lido Sports Association will be displayed in the window of the New New Company starting today.

Spring and Autumn

### Merchants Speculate and Profit Amidst the European War, Actually Hoarding Large Quantities of Medicines

— (Huang Ziqiang)

Hoping to Use Domestically Produced Medicines with Equal Effectiveness, Hoping for New Pharmaceutical Industry to Invent Universal Medicines

After the outbreak of the German-Polish war, merchants with experience from the First World War were delighted to welcome this opportunity to make a fortune. Looking at the soaring prices of various commodities these past two days, they are leaping upwards at high speed, like mercury columns plunged into boiling water. According to reports, the stocks of metals, paints, woolens, and other goods are very substantial, and shipping between the Mediterranean and the Far East has not been interrupted. Ships from neutral countries are also importing goods as usual. If everyone can work together and maintain the general status quo, the European war should not have a significant impact on Shanghai for the time being. However, merchants, driven solely by profit, have not seen the actual situation of this European war and the situation in 1914, nor have they realized that China, in its time of crisis, needs every citizen to cooperate and work together to overcome the difficult situation. They are constantly looking for opportunities to make money. Therefore, those who own goods are reluctant to sell them easily and are hoarding even more. Their slogan is: any imported goods can be hoarded.

Recently, a friend of mine contracted a serious illness. The doctor prescribed an injectable medicine. After running to four or five pharmacies, all of them replied, "Out of stock, new stock not yet arrived." Later, I bought it at a small pharmacy, but the price was more than seven times what it was before the war. In addition to my astonishment, I chatted with the clerk. According to him, most Western medicines are produced in Germany, and some special medicines can only be obtained from Germany. After the outbreak of the European war, the industry experts have hoarded the medicines and refused to sell them. Some pharmacies, which usually import more goods, are also holding out for higher prices at this time. Therefore, several German medicines are no longer sold on the market.

Under the slogan that all imported goods can be hoarded, medicines that are closely related to human life are actually being hoarded!

Incompetent doctors kill people, but good medicines save lives. Now, those with long sleeves and good dancing skills are hoarding life-saving medicines, indirectly becoming murderers. Besides sighing, we don't even have the courage to curse!

However, since humans are made up of cells, who can absolutely guarantee that they will not get sick? In addition to taking good care of themselves, for those living on the "isolated island," at least, within the limits of what is possible, I would like to offer a humble suggestion:

Nowadays, most doctors have a habit of prescribing foreign medicines in their prescriptions as if it were not fashionable enough otherwise. Indeed, as the clerk in the small pharmacy said, some special medicines must rely on foreign countries. However, some medicines recently invented by the new pharmaceutical industry are often equivalent in effectiveness to imported goods. Therefore, unless the symptoms are absolutely severe, I hope that doctors will try to prescribe domestic goods with equal effectiveness.

At the same time, many doctors in the new pharmaceutical industry who are buried in laboratories should not only focus on yeast preparations and medicines for venereal diseases, but should expand their research spirit to various universal medicines. Investors should also encourage doctors who have made inventions.

By extension, other industries should also do their best to exert the power of local resources!

Speculative merchants believe that this is an opportunity to make a fortune, but it is also a good opportunity to promote domestic goods. If the capital used for hoarding can be used as development capital, it is what we pray for!

### Publication of "Mechanical Poetry"

Starting from the next issue, this journal will publish Mr. Ruhui's "Mechanical Poetry," which contains anecdotes of various scientific inventions and the lack of understanding of science by people of that era, which can elicit a smile. Therefore, it can be regarded as a scientific anecdote, or an amusing tale. However, the space in the Spring and Autumn section is limited, so whether we publish it in each issue or in installments will depend on the situation. The Editorial Department

### How to Resolve Rent Disputes

— Mang Mang

No matter how many words you use, you can't write enough about the housing tricks on this isolated island. Landlords arbitrarily and confidently demand "ten years' rent in advance" for newly built houses or add several times the rent on old properties. Those with cleverer tactics will also use tricks such as "renovating the house and asking tenants to move out within a limited time," using bamboo fences as a threat, and then automatically demolishing them in the end. These are the most gentlemanly actions of the landlords. As a result of such cleverly established pretexts for raising rents, it is not the second landlords who suffer, but some third tenants whose lives are about to be thrown into a panic.

According to a recent report, various public groups are calling on landlords not to raise rents without reason. This is indeed a voice of justice! Naturally, the seriousness of this problem has long been noticed. I remember that there used to be an organization called the Rent Dispute Mediation Association, but in the end, it failed to have a great effect because the organization could not penetrate into the various alleys. If the voices of justice from various public groups do not have concrete measures to be implemented based on the needs of the situation, then no matter how loud the calls are, the landlords will still turn a deaf ear.

In my personal opinion, since rent disputes occur in one corner or another, if a single organization tries to manage all of Shanghai, it is bound to fail because it cannot be universally implemented. The most appropriate solution is for various public groups to convene relevant parties (including the concession authorities, the Real Estate Association, and various road associations) and let the public opinion of the meeting generate several fair principles. In the future, these principles may even serve as the basis for laws, so that all rent disputes can be resolved based on these principles, or let the law adjudicate fairly.

However, when discussing these principles, it is necessary to pay attention to the following points: (1) Rents that have been increased since "August 13th" cannot be increased again; (2) Rent increases cannot exceed x percent; (3) Landlords must state sufficient reasons for rent increases; (4) Houses built within a few years cannot be renovated arbitrarily; (5) Second landlords cannot arbitrarily increase rents to make money, unless they themselves do not pay rent for a room.

After this meeting generates the principles, it can be dissolved, leaving at most one or two staff members in case of need. After that, the more important organization is the establishment of rent arbitration committees in each alley, organized by the main landlord, second landlord, and third tenant. All disputes will be handled based on the rent mediation principles. If they are compatible, they will be implemented; if they are not, they will be adjudicated publicly. The problem can be easily solved. The reason for establishing organizations separately in each alley is to handle matters locally, quickly, and easily to obtain practical results.

This is a serious social problem that can only be resolved through the most just and peaceful means. All stubbornness can be subdued under the public opinion of the masses. The above method can be implemented, as for whether it is effective or not? It all depends on whether the executor handles it properly or not.

### Questions about the New Recipe

Dear Editor: I recently read Mr. Gu Zhong's letter of September 8th with his opinion on the new recipe, which meets the needs of the times. The method is to mix ten ounces of flour with six or eight ounces of bean dregs, which is sweet and delicious. However, I still do not understand its cooking method. I assume it must be cooked, but after mixing the bean dregs, must water be added? Is it spread out like a pancake? Or steamed, like bread? Please ask Mr. Gu Zhong to detail his method and answer with your pen. Sincerely, Zhu Zhuocheng

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Sixteen: Planning to Accomplish the Medical Elite, Thinking of Expanding the Village and Establishing Daycares

The story continues with the He sisters, upon seeing Zhu Airen, telling her: They received a telegram from their father, saying that a senior colleague would be arriving in Shanghai on Monday to meet them and discuss the silk weaving factory. They would not be able to go to Freedom Village on Sunday. Zhu Airen also told them that she had just received Jin Danyu's wedding invitation, which was set for next Sunday in Shanghai. She had already agreed to attend the wedding, and she could not miss it out of sisterly affection. Although Zhu Airen was very busy with her medical practice, she would take time out to attend that day since it was a Sunday, and it would not interfere with her work. She also sent a wedding invitation to Old Doctor Zhang, but Old Doctor Zhang might not go. Although it was a Sunday, it was not convenient for both of them to go. Later, they discussed whether to go early on Monday or on Saturday afternoon? They decided to go on Saturday afternoon. First, Danyu wanted them to go on Saturday, and they didn't know why. Second, Airen also advocated going on Saturday afternoon because she had some other things to deal with in Shanghai. Most of these matters were related to the hospital, and she was representing Old Doctor Zhang. Old Doctor Zhang was a member of the World Medical Association, and Shanghai also had a branch of the World Medical Association. However, Old Doctor Zhang entrusted many matters to Zhu Airen, saving him effort when she could. However, the World Medical Association had very strict qualifications; one could not become a member unless they had been practicing medicine for more than ten years. Therefore, although Zhu Airen was a Doctor of Medicine from the United States, she was temporarily unable to become a member of this association. Zhu Airen had not been to Shanghai for a long time, and she was planning to take care of some matters while attending the wedding. One of these matters was to represent Old Doctor Zhang in visiting Mrs. Suliya. It turned out that Mrs. Suliya and Old Doctor Zhang were old friends, and she greatly praised Old Doctor Zhang's Women's and Children's Hospital and Nursery for their good work. She knew that they had no foundation before, and now they have achieved such success, it was all due to painstaking efforts. She had said so not only in front of Jin Danyu, but also in front of other friends. She had hinted that if Old Doctor Zhang needed her help in any way, she could help some. She had even told Jin Danyu that she wanted to come to Anle Town to visit when she had time. Mrs. Suliya was a member of the American bourgeoisie and could use her surplus economy to make up for the deficiencies of the East. However, Old Doctor Zhang had always had sufficient economic resources for running the Women's and Children's Hospital and Nursery. If he were to start a new business, he would have to raise funds separately. (181)

### Private Arbitrage

— (Wang Hengtang)

Wealthy people in the interior who flee to the Shanghai Concession to escape the war want to bring their huge fortunes or bank deposits with them, but that is impossible. Because the government in the interior prohibits the carrying of cash out of the country, limiting it to a maximum of 500 yuan per person, in order to prevent capital from fleeing into the occupied areas. However, cunning merchants often use arbitrage methods to make the capital from the interior flow into the occupied areas.

For example, Shaoxing produces most of the rice wine, silk, tea, silk fabrics, tin foil, and the like. The total annual export volume is valued at more than 10,000,000 yuan. In principle, the proceeds from these goods should be remitted back to Shaoxing, but they do not do so. They find a merchant in Shanghai who buys these goods and ask them not to remit the money, but to find a wealthy merchant locally to withdraw money from the bank as a solution. The government agencies in the interior do not pay attention to this method. Even if they inquire, it seems that it is a matter of business between merchants in the interior, and there is no suspicion of remitting funds to the occupied area or capital escaping. But in fact, in the blink of an eye, the property of wealthy people in the interior has been remitted to Shanghai invisibly. As for the arbitrage spread, paying cash in the interior and receiving cash in Shanghai requires a fee of 150 or 160 yuan per thousand yuan, which is a huge loss. However, wealthy people do not care about this and try desperately to arbitrage. After obtaining money in Shanghai, they can engage in speculative activities such as buying foreign exchange and hoarding grain, and they do not care about the lives of others.

Therefore, this cunning method of arbitrage must be prohibited. It can not only consolidate the financial institutions in the rear, allowing capital to be used for projects that benefit rural areas or construction, but also reduce the number of wealthy merchants in Shanghai who engage in speculation, stabilizing the lives of the people. It is best for the local authorities in the production areas to control freight, verify and register the quantity and price of goods, and order them to be returned in full, not allowing mutual acceptance. If it can be handled in this way, it can prevent the depletion of funds in the interior, which is the fundamental way to stop leaks, far better than checking travelers and limiting the private carrying of cash, which is a superficial policy.

### After Listening to "The Tale of Qiu Xiang"

— Lord Ke Yun Lou

Mr. Nan Tiesheng, known as the Mei Lanfang of Hankou, has been famous for a long time. He made his debut in Shanghai, performing "The Tale of Qiu Xiang" on the first day to meet us. After listening, I returned home. The autumn lamp was quiet and cool, so I recorded the outline for this column.

The plot of "The Tale of Qiu Xiang" is very simple. The scene where Qiu Xiang gathers firewood in the suburbs and meets the scholar Li Chunfa is more compact. That evening, Furong Cao cross-dressed as a young man to play Li Chunfa. His performance was generous and had a restrained style. As one who usually plays a female role, it is difficult to achieve this unless one has long-term cultivation. I listened quietly and watched. Apart from feeling that his accent slightly revealed his true color when ending a phrase, he completely shed his old habits.

Tiesheng played the role of Qiu Xiang. The three sections of "Second Huang Slow Beat," "Shake Beat," and "Southern Bangzi" he sang are most thought-provoking. There are many sections here. Every beat and eye, in places of rise and fall, should be tight and not relaxed. If we let it go a little, it will be gone in a flash, and cannot be recovered. Wanhua's singing can stir people's emotions because of this. Tiesheng sings in a flat and rhythmic way, manipulating freely, tightly and methodically. When receiving his eyes and releasing his voice, he follows the rules, honoring Mei's style and never revealing any laziness. His voice is sweet. Listening to it is no different from drinking nectar. His deficiency is that his stage steps are frivolous and lack stability, losing the style of grace and dignity. When he met Li Chunfa, when he was surprised, happy, and shy, wanting to speak, his expression was too enthusiastic. When he scratched his head and played with his wet nurse, the "shake beat" was just finishing its ending sound. In a hurry, he suddenly dropped three eyes. This is truly the fundamental taboo of a main character singing opera, the so-called false voice and off-key. It is said that if we emphasize expressions, we must not ignore singing. Then "sound and expression" can move the audience's emotions, creating a good impression. The musician did not relax at all that evening. "The three eyes" were still pulled through, fully revealing the seriousness of the instrumental support. It is especially fortunate for Tiesheng to have found someone like that.

In short, Tiesheng, as a "son of a general," does not seek officialdom and honor, but has a passion for opera and dedicates himself to art. "He violates the family style," opposing tradition and has a different future. This is what we should sympathize with.

### Decoration of Kunqu Opera Su Wu

— Qiusheng

Recently, Mr. Xiao Cang made a review of Kunqu Opera "Looking at Hometown" in this journal. I feel that there are a few things that must be told to Mr. Xiao Cang, so I wrote this article. Perhaps the editor will not think it is meddlesome?

First, the clothes worn by Su Wu, according to the old rules of Kunqu Opera, must have an orange "loyal minister's coat" in addition to the blue robe. This "loyal minister's coat" seems to exist only in Kunqu Opera. It has not been seen in Peking Opera. It is shaped like a vest, but the shoulder part is slightly wider, almost reaching the upper arm, very similar to a type of summer coat worn by modern women today, but made of orange plain satin. I have watched Ni Chuan Yue perform this play several times before, and he wore this coat. I don't know whether Mr. Xiao Cang saw Zheng Chuan Jian wear this coat in his performance this time. Perhaps the costumes have not been complete in recent years and were simply omitted. However, breaking conventions is not good. Also, there are only three people who wear this loyal minister's coat in Kunqu Opera. One is Fan Li (played by Xiaosheng) in "Yiyang Ma" from "The Story of Washing Silk," showing that he is suffering "national disaster" in the stone room. The second is Yang Jisheng in "Zhan Yang" from "The Story of Singing Phoenix." The martyrdom of Duke Zhongmin is truly a matter of supreme loyalty throughout the ages. The third is Su Wu in "Herding Sheep."

Second, Mr. Xiao Cang said that the scepter held by Su Wu has only one beard in Kunqu Opera, while there are more in Peking Opera. I do not know that there are also certain rules in Kunqu Opera. According to "Herding Sheep," which is a Southern Drama written by a Yuan person, the full version has long been lost. Today, there are only the handwritten copies of the actors. The selections in various music scores and other books also do not exceed ten scenes. The "Suzhou Small Class" can sing a total of four scenes: "Little Forcing," "Herding Sheep," "Lost Courtesan," and "Looking at Hometown." The scepter held when performing "Little Forcing" has four or five beards. "Herding Sheep" has one or two fewer, "Lost Courtesan" has even fewer, and only one is left for "Looking at Hometown." This is to show the earliness of the time and has a deeper meaning.

The first time I watched these four scenes was still in the "New Yuefu" era. I remember that Zheng Chuan Jian played "Little Forcing," Shi Chuan Zhen played "Herding Sheep" and "Lost Courtesan," and Ni Chuan Yue played the last scene, "Looking at Hometown." The four scenes were performed in a row, and the actor playing Su Wu changed three times, and the voice became louder and louder, making the audience more and more excited. I still remember that Zhao Chuan Jun played Li Ling, Zhou Chuan Zheng played Wei Lu, and Bao Chuan Duo played the "Master" Su Wu saw in his dream in the "Herding Sheep" scene. I can't remember the others. Later, I watched "Looking at Hometown" many times, "Little Forcing" fewer times, and "Herding Sheep" and "Lost Courtesan" only once. Now, Chuan Zhen has passed away, and Chuan Yue has gone far away. It is impossible to watch these four plays in a row again. I am filled with emotion when I think about it.

### Drama Arts Society Revives "Shanghai Nights"

"Shanghai Nights," the first play with the theme of isolated island life, has been well received by all walks of life since it was performed by the Shanghai Drama Arts Society at the "Xuan Palace Theater" last month, due to the realism of the play's theme and the efforts of the performance. The literary and art circles once praised it as "the poetic history of Shanghai in the past two years." However, the performance period was only one week at the time, and many audience members did not have a chance to see it. Recently, the Drama Arts Society authorities received numerous letters urging a revival, so they decided to postpone the originally scheduled "World of Lies" and revive "Shanghai Nights" for one star first (starting from the tenth) to meet the audience's demands.

The cast of this revival is the same as last time and has not been changed. The only problem is Lan Lan. According to the advertisement in the newspaper, Lan Lan plays "Cuixi" in "Lafei" and "Sunrise." "Sunrise" starts on the 9th, and "Shanghai Nights" starts on the 10th. In fact, there is a conflict. However, Lan Lan is A for "Cuixi" in "Lafei," and Bai Yan is B, so there may not be a problem.

Mei Lingchun, the old man in "Shanghai Nights," was originally played by Wang Jixu. In the last performance, Wang Jixu became ill after playing for two days due to excessive excitement. Later, he was replaced by Sudan. This time, Wang Jixu has recovered from his illness and loves to come back to the stage.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The Separation and Reunion of Wang Keqin and Zhang Xun

At that time, he commanded tens of thousands of undisciplined people. The only talented person was Wan Mu Shi, and among the martial officers, the only one who could be considered was Zhang Wensheng. When the Qing Dynasty was coming, there were two famous gang leaders (that is, leaders of the Green Forest) in the Xuhai area, one called White Face Wang San and the other Rolling Dragon. It is said that Zhang Wensheng (Zi Xingwu) was the Rolling Dragon of that year. Eight or nine out of ten of Pigtail Marshal's subordinates were bandits who had been recruited. If there was no old Pigtail Marshal there to lead them, it would be difficult to make these wild people sincerely submit. Coincidentally, Wensheng was the same as the Pigtail Marshal in not forgetting the kindness he had received. His loyalty to the Pigtail Marshal was the same as the Pigtail Marshal's loyalty to the Qing Dynasty. Zhang Dong has always had a habit of scolding contests. A scolding contest seems a little more serious than joking. Generally, people in low-level society often like to play with people by scolding. As long as the other party can scold playfully and freshly, even if it hurts his parents and ancestors, he is happy to slap his butt and spin around, not blaming others at all. The Pigtail Marshal has had this kind of addiction since he was a child. It seems that he can't eat if he doesn't get scolded for a day. However, now that he has a high position, who among these subordinates dares to joke with him and have a scolding contest? However, the only one who can play with him by scolding is Rolling Dragon. Some people say that when the first Han Lord launched a large-scale campaign against Wu to avenge Guan Zhang, the ministers tried to persuade him not to listen. Kongming sighed and said, "If Xiaozhi were here, he would be able to stop the Lord from going east, so as not to fall into danger." Fa Zheng's position and reputation were far worse than Zhuge Liang's, but he was the only one who could stop the Lord from going east, and he was also believed by Kongming. It is said that the first Han Lord and Fa Xiaozhi often joked. Joking and scolding contests are half true and half false, both true and false. False can be turned into true, and true can be regarded as false. Even if Fa Zheng annoyed the Lord and retorted a few words, the first Han Lord wanted to punish him, but he was used to joking in the past. It was not true, nor false. In the end, there was no way but to let him go. Originally, Han Gao and the first Han Lord were both from very low backgrounds and had been living with commoners for a long time. So even though they were emperors, they still enjoyed it. Zhang Wensheng and the Pigtail Marshal started scolding each other as soon as they met. The Pigtail Marshal was unhappy for a day if he was separated from him. Sometimes, in front of many people, Wensheng was embarrassed to make trouble with him, so he had to provoke Wensheng and start scolding first. Don't look down on them for not having any rules. However, the Pigtail Marshal's restoration failed in the end, but he did not die a tragic death, and a part of the Anwu Army was still retained and did not suffer a complete defeat. This was also due to Wensheng's scolding contests with the Pigtail Marshal. (99)

### Brief News from the Art Scene

The Shanghai Drama Society will soon revive "The Beginning of Man," with Liu Qiong specially invited to guest star as Zhang Bonan.

Various companies are writing historical drama scripts, including: "The Tale of the Wandering Swordsman" directed by Wu Wenchao and written by Sun Jing, "The Legend of the White Snake" directed and written by Yang Xiaozhong (Guohua also plans to film this), and "The Sorrow of the Fragrant Concubine" directed by Fang Peilin (originally "Magistrate Qiao's Chaotic Matchmaking," the script was lost).

Zhang Zhizhi said, "Wu Yonggang is writing the script for 'The Biography of Martyrs.'" Wu Yonggang said, "I am writing about Yue Fei. The so-called 'Biography of Martyrs' means both heroic and martyred."

Lu Ming's contract with Yi Hua is about to expire and will not be renewed; he has already signed a contract with Guohua. The patrons, Mr. and Mrs. Chen Kengran, have a package deal contract with Yi Hua, so there is naturally no problem. They will also join Guohua together. It is also heard that Chen Kengran's debut film is "Du Shiniang Sinks the Treasure Chest in Anger," scheduled to begin filming on the 23rd of this month.

It is said that Wu Cun has a strange habit when writing scripts: he refuses to answer the phone. Doctor Ru is currently rewriting "The Adulterous History of Su San," and all incoming calls are handled by Mrs. Wu on his behalf.

### Gu Lan Jun Suffers a Severe Case of Hives – "Wang Xifeng" Faces Another Setback – Charity Tea Dance Appearance Cancelled

— Silver Thread

Miss Gu Lanjun's recent films have mostly been grand historical productions. Following "Diao Chan" and "Wu Zetian," the film "Wang Xifeng's Havoc in the Ningguo Mansion" is now awaiting the completion of one final large set piece before it is finished. Her next new work is scheduled to be "Red Thread Steals the Box," which may be personally directed by Zhang Shankun. In mid-June, Miss Gu suffered from a severe fever due to overwork filming in the summer heat, and her work was suspended for a long time. After she recovered, she reluctantly returned to the set, hoping to rush to complete the film and then rest. However, after filming for a few days, she unexpectedly caught a cold due to physical weakness, and her body suddenly broke out in numerous hives, with her face also showing slight swelling. "Wang Xifeng" has suffered another setback as a result, causing the film set work to be suspended again since the day before yesterday. The charity tea dance hosted by the Refugee Relief Association, which was scheduled to be held at the Paramount Ballroom yesterday, had originally invited her to cut the ribbon, but she could only postpone it, which inevitably detracted from the event.
