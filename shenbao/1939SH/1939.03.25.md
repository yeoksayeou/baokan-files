### Fierce Battles in Northern Jiangxi for Four Days and Nights: Chinese Troops Firmly Defend the Eastern Positions of Wuning; Japanese Main Force Crosses Tanxi to Invade from the South, All Attacks Repelled; Repeated Fierce Battles in Wucheng, Still in Chinese Hands; Japanese Troops in Southern Hubei Advance on Beigang Without Success

(Hong Kong) Guilin Dispatch: The war situation in northern Jiangxi is extremely tense. The majority of the Japanese troops have crossed the Xiushui River, with the main force located in Panxi City, southwest of Yongxiu. The vanguard has crossed Anyi towards Fengxin, attempting to encircle Nanchang. Fengxin is a hundred *li* from Nanchang. Nanchang Dispatch: The Japanese troops concentrated near various locations around Dean number over ten thousand, mostly transferred from Wuhan. The main force is distributed in areas such as Dean and Wuning. A portion of their artillery has been transferred from Nanjing. The Japanese troops advancing southwest between Ruoxi and Wuning are engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese troops in the nearby mountains. The Japanese troops in Jiujiang are also restless, and the Chinese guerrillas in Mount Lu are launching attacks on the Japanese troops. The Chinese and Japanese troops in Hubei are still engaged in a standoff across the Xiang River. (Special dispatch from the 24th)

(Chongqing) The center of gravity of the war situation has now shifted to northern Jiangxi, while the fighting in central Hubei has become subdued. Many of the Japanese troops in central Hubei have been transferred to Jiangxi Province to reinforce their forces. The Chinese and Japanese troops across the Xiang River are still facing each other across the river. There are occasional artillery battles in areas such as Yuekou. (Special dispatch from the 24th)

Xiushui: In order to cover the flanks of their forces crossing the Xiushui River to invade from the south, the Japanese army, starting on the 21st, dispatched a portion of the Sixth Division to advance from Ruoxi towards Jinkou, east of Wuning, which is held by the Chinese forces. For four days, they have been engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese troops in Jinkou. The Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties. On the 24th, the Chinese and Japanese troops are still locked in a stalemate near Jinkou. The situation in Wuning is stable.

Xiushui: Qian on the Nanxun front was sultry on the 23rd and suddenly cold on the 24th. It was as if the seasons changed in a day and night. The changes in the war situation in the highway area west of Qian are like the climate of these two days. It reached a high degree of intensity on the 23rd and turned stable on the 24th. Since a portion of the Japanese 106th Division forcibly crossed the Xiushui River at Gouziling, between Qiujin and Yongxiu, on the 17th, its main force has advanced along the highway to Tanxi by the 23rd, with a small number of tanks covering its troops, harassing the area south of Tanxi. It seemed that there was an attempt to bypass Nanchang along the highway and cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. After the Chinese army bravely fought back, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army, the Japanese army harassing the south of Tanxi were all defeated. The remaining Japanese troops have now retreated to Tanxi, and the Chinese army is intensifying its encirclement. The morale of the Chinese troops in the highway area is very high. Someone personally went to the front line to supervise the battle, and the situation immediately improved. Furthermore, in the area of Wucheng, east of Nanxun, the Japanese army has launched fierce attacks for a week with a combined force of land, sea, and air. A certain unit of the Chinese army is still bravely resisting. The fighting is quite fierce. As of the morning of the 24th, Wucheng is still firmly held by the Chinese army. As for the front of the Nanxun Railway, the Chinese army is still firmly defending a certain position on the south bank of the Xiushui River, with no changes to date. (Dispatch from the 24th)

(Chongqing) Well-informed sources say that 6,000 Japanese troops have crossed the Xiushui River and are now advancing along the highway towards Nanchang. The Japanese army's advance is assisted by the air force, so the front line of Nanchang and the city of Nanchang have been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft in recent days. (Dispatch from the 24th, Associated Press)

(Chongqing) According to news received here, the Japanese army has been constantly trying to cross the Hanshui River in western Hubei, but all attempts have been repelled by the Chinese army, failing to succeed. (Dispatch from the 24th, Huitong News Agency)

Pingjiang: After the Chinese army in Jiuling launched an offensive, it has approached Tongcheng.

Fierce battles are now taking place. (Dispatch from the 24th)

Miluo: The fighting on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway has resumed. A certain unit of the Chinese army launched a multi-pronged attack on the Japanese army in the southeast area of Yuezhou at dawn on the 24th, with gains. One route occupied Qiguling between Guozhen and Matang. The Japanese army has now retreated to Matang, Guozhen, Xinkaitang, Xitang, and Taolin, relying on solid fortifications to resist stubbornly. The Chinese army is currently besieging them. (Dispatch from the 24th)

(Yichang) There is a strong wind and rain on the front line in central Hubei, and the war situation on the entire line is subdued. (Dispatch from the 24th)

(Chongqing) According to a military report released here, there have been important fierce battles on the Nanxun Railway since March 18. The Japanese army's advance west of Poyang Lake is extremely slow. Although Wucheng has been constantly bombarded by Japanese gunboats, it is still firmly held by the Chinese army. (Dispatch from the 24th, Huitong News Agency)

(Hankou) According to news received here, the Japanese army attacking Wuning suffered a major defeat due to a surprise attack by the Chinese army in Guanglingshan, 20 kilometers northeast of the area. It is reported that in addition to more than 800 soldiers killed, the Chinese forces also captured 44 machine guns and more than 400 automatic rifles. (Dispatch from the 24th, Express News Agency)

(Chongqing) According to news received here, the Japanese army advancing south from Yongxiu is currently being contained by the Chinese army at the Qian of Wanjiabu, Anyi, on the bank of the Fengshui River. The Japanese report that the Japanese army has reached Fengxin, 50 kilometers west of Nanchang, is completely inaccurate. It is reported that the Chinese army is still holding the line from Anyi to Wanjiabu, resisting the Japanese army's offensive. Also, due to the gradual approach of the war, the sound of artillery fire could be faintly heard in Nanchang yesterday, and the authorities have begun to evacuate the population. In Wuning, both sides are still in a standoff near Chenzhuang. (Dispatch from the 24th, Express News Agency)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese military personnel telling a reporter from the Express News Agency, the Japanese army in northern Jiangxi is now continuing to attack Nanchang fiercely. It is expected that the great bloody battle that will determine the fate of Nanchang will begin at the beginning of next week. The main force of the Japanese army is now continuing to advance southwest along the Liaoshui River on the west side of the Nanxun Road, attempting to cut off the transportation line between Nanchang, Wuning, and Changsha. The war is now gradually expanding from the area of Wucheng and Tujiabu on the west bank of Poyang Lake to the triangular area between the Fengshui and Liaoshui Rivers. The Japanese tank columns once broke into Wanjiabu, Anyi, Fengxin, and other places on the banks of the Fengshui River yesterday, but they have all been repelled by the Chinese army. Because all the fortifications of the Chinese army in Wucheng were destroyed by Japanese aircraft, they transferred to the southwest new positions last night to continue the resistance. (Dispatch from the 24th, Express News Agency)

(Hong Kong) According to Japanese propaganda here, Fengxin, 50 kilometers west of Nanchang, has been invaded by the Japanese army. It is also said that after the Japanese army crossed the Xiushui River, it took the Yongxiu route to attack Fengxin. However, according to Chinese reports, the Japanese army is still being blocked by the Fengshui River, a tributary of the Xiushui River. All the bridges there have been destroyed by the Chinese army, and there are Chinese machine gun positions along the coast, so the Japanese army is still unable to forcibly cross the river. It is heard that on Monday and Tuesday (20th and 21st), the Japanese army did disregard everything and risked their lives to cross the river, but after the Chinese army calmly responded, more than a thousand men were annihilated, and more than six hundred and fifty men were captured. During this fierce battle, the Japanese side deliberately spread the news of the capture of Fengxin. (Dispatch from the 24th, Express News Agency)

### Japanese Troops Stealthily Cross the Qiantang River; More Than a Thousand Have Been Annihilated; Chinese Troops Bomb and Destroy Bridge Piers; Large Detachments Cross the River to Pursue Japanese Soldiers

Jinhua: The Japanese troops in the Hangzhou area have twice attempted to stealthily cross the Qiantang River, intending to harass eastern Zhejiang, but after being repelled by the Chinese garrison, they recently made another move. On the morning of the 20th, they released smoke screens on the riverbank to cover their engineers in building a wooden bridge on the ruins of the Qiantang River Bridge and forcibly crossing the river.

### Guerrilla Forces in the Three Northeastern Provinces Are Extremely Active

(Chongqing) General Li Du, Chairman of Jilin Province, is currently here. He told a reporter from the Associated Press that Japanese newspapers are trying their best to prohibit the publication of all patriotic movements in the three northeastern provinces. The volunteers in the three northeastern provinces are now redoubling their efforts to fight the Japanese army. The Japanese army's communication lines are often cut off, so they dare not go deep. The Japanese immigration policy cannot be implemented due to the repeated attacks by the guerrillas. At present, there are many guerrilla forces in various parts of the three northeastern provinces. Their weapons are all seized from the Japanese army. The more difficult their environment is, the more determined they become. Because the Chinese guerrillas constantly harass the Japanese army, the Japanese authorities dare not transfer the Manchurian defense forces to other places. It is learned that Li will soon leave Chongqing to take office. (Dispatch from the 24th, Associated Press)

Editorial

### Review of Repeated Five-Minister Conferences in Japan

In recent days, the Hiranuma Cabinet of Japan has convened Five-Minister Conferences repeatedly. Prime Minister Hiranuma, Army Minister Itagaki, Navy Minister Yonai, Finance Minister Ishiwatari, and Foreign Minister Arita attended, exchanging opinions on the recent situations in China and Europe. Although the Five-Minister Conference has no specific provision in the constitution of Japan, in recent years, when the cabinet encounters difficult problems in its administration, it often convenes a Five-Minister Conference to exchange opinions first, and then submit them to the cabinet meeting. Therefore, the convening of the Five-Minister Conference is tantamount to a reflection of the Japanese cabinet's administration hitting a wall. The Hiranuma Cabinet is now convening such conferences repeatedly, which is of course because it feels difficulties with the current situation and has to discuss countermeasures.

Currently, according to the opinions of Itagaki and others, Japan's military action against China requires occupying Lanzhou in the north and Kunming in the south. This would allow them to control the two major international routes in northwest and southwest China, prevent foreign military supplies from entering China, and force China to surrender and end the war. However, their forces in China are not only insufficient to bear this heavy responsibility, but even to consolidate the so-called occupied areas is difficult. Therefore, to realize this plan, they must increase reinforcements from the country; however, there are no troops to be transferred within the country, so the plan cannot be realized, and the end of the war is indefinitely postponed. In addition, the general public is averse to war because they cannot bear the burden of the ever-expanding war expenses, and even evolves into a widespread anti-war movement. The Hiranuma Cabinet naturally feels vexed when it sees this situation.

Secondly, Japan's war of aggression against China has caused its economic panic. It was originally an imperialist with congenital deficiency. Although it is called an emerging industrial country, all it has is light industry, and there is fundamentally no basis for heavy industry. Moreover, it is pathetic that the raw materials for both heavy and light industries must be supplied from abroad, so it is already a country with an excess of imports over exports in peacetime. Since the outbreak of the war of aggression against China, a large number of military supplies have been continuously imported, increasing the excess of imports over exports, and the outflow of cash has also increased accordingly, to the point where there is a lack of gold reserves in the country, and the exchange rate of the yen has gradually fallen as a result, while the prices of imported raw materials and military supplies have risen in inverse proportion. At the same time, repeated increases in war expenses have created a huge deficit panic. In order to save this panic, they have used methods such as issuing public bonds indiscriminately, increasing taxes at will, and compulsory savings. They try every means to increase the burden on the people, but in fact, it is still a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. So they are considering using the methods of devaluing the yen and issuing banknotes indiscriminately. From the surface, the former can indeed lower the prices of their manufactured products, making them easier to sell in foreign markets, so as to save the crisis of excess imports, but the prices of all imported raw materials and military supplies will rise as a result, and the result may still be more loss than gain. As for issuing banknotes indiscriminately, it is even more dangerous, because the result of issuing banknotes indiscriminately will accelerate the rise in prices, and the stability of the currency will also be lost.

As for the situation in Europe, since Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the attitude of the democratic front has gradually become active, and it is organizing a united front to prevent German aggression. The development of this situation is naturally unfavorable to Japan, because once Germany is surrounded, there will be at least one less accomplice to its aggressive policies, which is something it is very concerned about. It has recently been trying its best to clarify that there is nothing remarkable about its relationship with Germany and Italy, and has recently released the smokescreen of "Emperor's personal rule" in an attempt to change the perception of it by countries such as Britain, France, and the United States, so that the increasingly unfavorable international environment for it will gradually become favorable. At the same time, it also sees that in East Asia, the opposition of interests with Britain is difficult to reconcile, so it has particularly expressed goodwill to the United States, wanting to dismantle the cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East, so as to achieve its ambition of dominating East Asia.

The development of the above-mentioned aspects makes Japan's aggressive policy hit a wall everywhere. The convening of the Five-Minister Conference is to discuss a way to overcome the above-mentioned difficulties. However, although Japanese militarists have the courage to wager the entire national fortune on a single throw, they have no way to ease the anti-war sentiment of the domestic people, let alone the magic to change economic iron rules, and the diplomatic rhetoric wrapped in sugar cannot hide the ferocious face of attempting to dominate the Far East. So the result of this kind of conference is nothing more than a formality.

### British House of Commons Passes China Exchange Balance Law on Third Reading; Simon Hopes Legal Tender Can Be Stabilized; Praises China for Maintaining Credit on Foreign Debt

(London) The China Exchange Equalization Fund Bill passed its third reading in the House of Commons today without any dissent. It has now been submitted to the House of Lords for discussion. (Dispatch from the 24th, Reuters)

(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon today brought the China Exchange Equalization Fund Bill to a third reading in the House of Commons, and made a speech requesting the House of Commons to pass it. He said, "Mr. Lawrence provided various opinions based on his past experience when the second reading was held on the 20th of this month. I have carefully studied them and feel that it is appropriate to maintain the original draft of this bill. However, one point needs to be stated, which is related to the supervision of finance. Regardless of the amount of money involved, the Ministry of Finance and the government attach importance to it, and so do the gentlemen of the House of Commons. Therefore, I still hope that Mr. Lawrence will not hesitate to give advice. Furthermore, when this case was in the second reading, I made it clear that the government's intention in this move is peace, not to make profits for the bank, but to support those who we should support. The method agreed upon by China and the United Kingdom this time is an innovation this year. This was revealed by Mr. Lawrence, and I completely agree. According to this method, the interest on the five million pounds provided by the two British banks is set at 2.75% per week. This interest is paid by the two Chinese banks, amounting to 137,500 pounds per year. We hope that China can gradually overcome the major difficulties encountered in its struggle, and we hope that the above methods can effectively help stabilize China's legal tender. I firmly believe that this move will be of great benefit to China. Once the 12-month period expires, this method may be extended or adjusted. In view of the current situation, this method is indeed very appropriate. All interest on loans from British banks is stipulated to be paid by banks on the Chinese side, and Chinese banks have the Chinese government as their backing. Regarding the repayment of foreign debt principal and interest, the Chinese government has excellent credit. If it can maintain this traditional policy in the future, I absolutely believe that it will be able to fully fulfill its obligations. Regarding the efforts of countries around the world to maintain their foreign debt credit, I dare say that no country is better than China. As for the loan interest rate, I am unwilling to modify it unless the situation changes, but I believe that it may change with the situation in one or two years." (Dispatch from the 24th, Havas)

(London) After Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon brought the China Exchange Equalization Fund Bill to a third reading in the House of Commons, Lawrence, a member of the opposition Labour Party, immediately proposed an amendment, arguing that the interest rate guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance should not be higher than 2.75% per week. After discussion and voting, it was rejected by 72 votes to 33 votes. Then, using a show of hands, the original bill proposed by the government was passed on the third reading, and the China Exchange Equalization Fund Law was established. (Dispatch from the 24th, Havas)

(London) The China Exchange Equalization Fund Bill has been passed on the third reading by the House of Commons. Although the opposition Labour Party proposed an amendment beforehand, its meaning was not fundamentally opposed to the move. Labour MP Lawrence made an explanation in the proposed amendment, saying that the interest rate on loans from British banks under this bill is set at 2.75% per week, and the British government guarantees it. I think that if the Chinese and British sides decide to extend it when the 12-month period expires, even if the interest rate is appropriately increased, the British government's guarantee to its own banks should still be stipulated not to exceed 2.75%, so as not to increase the burden on the national treasury. Another Labour MP, Dinkle, continued to speak, saying that if the Chinese government is unable to pay the interest on this loan in the future and needs to be paid by the British government, I think the amount paid by the British government should not exceed 2.5%, because the interest rate on most securities in the London market is 2.5%, then although the agreed interest rate between China and Britain is 2.75%, if the British government needs to pay it in the future, it will not be too much to calculate it at 2.5%. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon immediately replied that the opinions of Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Dinkel are worthy of attention, but I think it is not necessary to add them to the bill, so as not to be cumbersome. In addition, Labour MP Lang also made a speech, expressing opposition. His wording and arguments were beyond what people generally expected. He said that although he agreed with giving China greater assistance in finance and economics, the bill proposed by the government was not very thorough, because the United Kingdom had previously lent funds to Czechoslovakia, and after Czechoslovakia was annexed by Germany, this loan had all fallen into the hands of Germany. The past can be used as a lesson, so it is advocated that the government's bill should take into account this unexpected danger. (Dispatch from the 24th, Havas)

(Chongqing) The Ministry of Transportation's Chongqing-Hami air route officially commenced on the 24th. The "Lanzhou" large aircraft assigned to this route, with its silver-gray fuselage, is a magnificent sight. The aircraft is piloted by chief pilot Lin Jingbin and co-pilot Chen Hongjia. In addition to a radio operator, the plane also carries four passengers from the Soviet Embassy. The Lanzhou took off at 9:00 AM, stopping overnight in Hanzhong today. On the 25th, it will continue westward, stopping at Lanzhou, Liangzhou, Suzhou, and arriving in Hami on the same day.

### Wang Jingwei: Mysterious Whereabouts, Rumors of Secret Departure from Hanoi

(Hong Kong) According to news from Hanoi, Wang Jingwei was not present at the funeral of Zeng Zhongming in Hanoi at 5:00 PM on the 22nd, which was considered quite strange, given that Mr. Zeng's sacrifice was essentially as a scapegoat for Wang Zhaoming. It has now been ascertained that Wang Jingwei secretly departed after Zeng Zhongming was injured in the assassination attempt. It is rumored that he is no longer in Hanoi. As for the four assassins arrested by the French police, it is said that they are all suspects and not the real culprits. After investigations by the French police, none of the four have provided any substantial confessions. It is reported that the Hanoi authorities are still investigating the true assassins. (Express News Agency, 24th)

(Hong Kong) According to news received here, a spokesperson for the Guangdong Army recently denied rumors that the Japanese would first withdraw their troops from South China to negotiate peace with China. They also stated that the Japanese army in South China would not be able to withdraw before Japanese military "objectives" were achieved. It is reported that this sudden statement from the Japanese side is a response to the demands of pro-peace elements in the Wang Jingwei faction seeking peace with Japan. Wang had sent people to Tokyo to request that the Japanese first withdraw their troops from South China to facilitate the propaganda of the Wang faction's peace proposals. The Japanese government initially agreed, believing that the war could be concluded, but the Japanese militarists deemed it a "grave mistake." Therefore, they suddenly expressed the South China Japanese army's strong stance through a spokesperson. (Express News Agency, 24th)

(Chongqing) Regarding the assassination attempt on Wang Jingwei, former vice president of the Chinese Kuomintang, in Hanoi, French Indochina, local newspapers only briefly reported the news without adding any comments. Government officials, however, did not express satisfaction with the matter, pointing out that the Chinese government had provided Mr. Wang with a large sum of money and even dispatched bodyguards for his protection. (Haitong Dispatch, 24th)

### British Delegation to China: The Timing is Not Ripe

If the Board of Trade believes that the commercial possibilities are worth exploring, the Board of Trade is certainly willing to assist those involved and send a delegation to depart. (Reuters, 23rd)

After the crash, all were burned to death except for the pilot and co-pilot, who were injured. (Reuters, 24th)

### European Situation Calms Down, Compromise Atmosphere Released; Joint Declaration of Britain, France, Russia, Poland, etc. Fails; Germany, Content, Still Leaves Room for Expansion

(London) Regarding the issue of a collective security organization in Eastern Europe, after Britain contacted the relevant countries, it originally planned two approaches: one was for Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland to issue a joint declaration, and the other was to convene an international conference in London or Paris in the short term. According to responsible sources, after a meeting today between British and French cabinet members, the above two approaches have been abandoned. However, through normal diplomatic channels, they will continue to exchange opinions with the relevant countries, especially Poland, the Soviet Union, and Romania. The British and French cabinet members decided on this new approach because Germany and Romania have already signed a commercial agreement, and European peace is no longer in imminent danger. In any case, the British and French governments should maintain close contact and cooperate with countries resisting aggression. The British and French cabinet members should meet again when necessary, but the date has not yet been definitively decided. (Havas, 23rd)

(London) London diplomatic observers say that while Germany is advancing on all fronts, the diplomatic authorities of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland are frequently exchanging opinions, but there seem to be no results. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky went to the Foreign Office today. It is heard that the Soviet Union's reply agreeing to sign the British-drafted anti-aggression declaration will soon be delivered to the British government. It is also heard that Poland, although very sympathetic to democracies, has some concerns and is still hesitating. It is still demanding that Britain and France provide a concrete guarantee that if Poland fights against Germany, Britain and France will support it, and that this is a prerequisite for Poland to join the declaration. Political circles here believe that the King of Italy's speech shows a willingness to establish good relations with various countries, but the world is still waiting for Mussolini's speech on Sunday. (Reuters, 23rd)

(London) Regarding the issue of a collective security organization in Eastern Europe, official sources here recently declared that the Soviet government has unconditionally expressed its support. According to the draft's content, it is very simple, stating that peace-loving countries should always unite and consult each other immediately when emergencies endangering European peace arise in order to determine "steps to resist aggression." In addition, France has unconditionally expressed its support, but Poland refuses to accept. (Havas, 23rd)

(Moscow) Soviet Foreign Trade Commissioner Mikoyan, a confidant of Stalin, has been specially recalled from vacation to greet British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson. Hudson met with a Reuters reporter today and said that he was deeply impressed by Mr. Mikoyan's affability. Hudson will have the first concrete discussions today on improving trade relations between the Soviet Union and Britain, and due to the recent events in Central Europe, their conversation may contain significant political implications. (Reuters, 24th)

(Moscow) British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson held his first meeting with Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov last night. (Haitong Dispatch, 24th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons this afternoon was more conciliatory. There are two reasons for this: (1) British Chargé d'Affaires in Germany Forbes telegraphed the government, requesting that it issue a statement saying that the country's policy is not aimed at encircling Germany, nor does it intend to obstruct the legitimate activities of the German people, so as to avoid giving that country an excuse to engage in propaganda. (2) British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine also telegraphed, making some suggestions, stating that if the British government could issue a statement saying that it had no intention of organizing an "anti-dictatorial crusade," it would greatly facilitate diplomacy with Italy. (Havas, 23rd)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons today regarding the international situation were endorsed by the Government Party, which considered the wording to be extremely correct in the current circumstances. Even critics of Chamberlain within the Government Party considered the remarks to be firm and important. Several Labour MPs also expressed satisfaction today. Neither the Labour Party nor the Liberal Party questioned Chamberlain after his speech. (Reuters, 23rd)

(Rome) Today's editorial in the Italian Telegrafico news agency stated that if Britain wants to punish Germany, war is inevitable. If Britain only wants to create a security system to avoid future accidents, it should not insist on a policy of encirclement, but accept the clearing of past events. Italy desires peace and a peaceful resolution of all issues. In the future, Italy will have an important mission in the stability of the new Europe, but other countries should not repeat major mistakes, and should not think that Italy can be intimidated, expelled, or deceived. The newspaper mentioned France, saying that the bridges have not yet been burned, but the issues mentioned in the Italian note last December cannot be dealt with casually. (Reuters, 24th)

(Washington) After Germany annexed the Bohemian and Moravian provinces of Czechoslovakia, political figures here recently declared that the U.S. action will be temporarily limited to not recognizing the de facto situation and imposing additional tariffs on German imports. It is still unknown what Britain and France intend to do to prevent future aggression by totalitarian states. Furthermore, diplomatic circles here believe that the negotiations conducted by Britain and France on the issue of a collective security organization in Eastern Europe are extremely slow, only giving the Rome-Berlin axis opportunities to covet. Moreover, various European democracies have recently shown a willingness to reconcile with Italy, but they know that no matter what concessions they make, this reconciliation is likely to be futile and unsustainable. (Havas, 24th)

(Berlin) Berlin newspapers today called the three agreements that Germany signed yesterday with Lithuania, Slovakia, and Romania "clear evidence of the work of transforming Europe." The "Volkischer Beobachter" declared, "This is just a small part of the huge plan that the National Socialist Party began in early 1938 to transform Central and Southeastern Europe. However, such achievements in a short period of twelve months can be said to be unprecedented in history." (Haitong Dispatch, 24th)

Swinemünde: The Führer, Hitler, returned to this question from the port of Memel at 9:15 this morning on the pocket battleship "Deutschland," and then transferred to a special train to return to Berlin. (Havas, 24th)

(Berlin) The second 35,000-ton battleship is scheduled to be launched on the first of next month, and the ceremony will be presided over by Hitler. It has been named "Admiral Tirpitz." (It is noted that the first battleship was named "Bismarck." After the launching ceremony is completed), Hitler will go to Berchtesgaden for rest. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Propaganda Minister Goebbels may go to Italy for vacation, it is also uncertain. (Havas, 24th)

(Berlin) The official draft of Hitler's speech in Memel released by the German News Agency tonight deleted the phrase "I believe that we have fully achieved this extraordinary ending of compensation." (Reuters, 23rd)

### French Worries

(Paris) People here are already worried about the trade agreement signed between Germany and Romania. Although Romanian officials do not recognize that this agreement has placed Romanian interests under German control, and point out that other countries can also sign similar agreements with Romania, all sectors in France question whether Romania still has other interests. The French now hope that a British commercial delegation and British capital may offset this danger. Some well-informed people in France say that the Romanian trade agreement is only the first step in Germany's plan to expand its control over Romania, and fear that Lithuania will also follow suit. They believe that the best way to resist this action is for London to adopt a powerful Anglo-French-Soviet alliance, including other countries if possible, to resist German aggression, because the British stance against Hitler is the same as against Mussolini. (Reuters, 24th)

(Paris) The international situation has developed in many directions in recent days. The most prominent examples are: Under the advocacy of Britain, peace-loving countries are discussing the issuance of a joint declaration; King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy delivered an important decree at the Fascist vocational group meeting yesterday; Germany signed agreements with Lithuania and the Slovak State, respectively, and also signed a commercial agreement with Romania; Hungarian troops entered the Slovak State; British Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke in the House of Commons yesterday about the international situation. All of these are of great importance. In addition to reporting as much as possible, newspapers here are discussing them in various ways. For example, the right-wing "Echo de Paris" criticized the Soviet Union's actions and insisted that Britain and France should not cooperate with it. It said, "We must now choose between Moscow and Rome. Our extremists tend to the Soviet Union and clash with Italy, almost leading us astray on the path of ideological warfare. We must know that the result of the war, no matter who celebrates victory, will inevitably enhance the position of Soviet Marxism, which is unacceptable." The "Journal" published news from Berlin, stating that "Romania has abundant food and is rich in oil. This kind of resource has long been coveted by Germany. After Germany established a commercial agreement with Romania, its policy of subtle advancement has therefore gained a thicker foundation. As far as the agreement between Germany and Lithuania is concerned, it is the first step in Germany's strict control of Lithuania, and it is also a prelude to the conquest of other countries along the Baltic Sea." The right-wing "Petit Parisien" reported that "According to reports from Berlin diplomatic circles, the issue of the Free City of Danzig will be resolved within this historically significant month." The right-wing "Le Matin" commented on the Italian King's decree, saying, "Roman public opinion generally believes that the tone of the decree is mild, but Prime Minister Mussolini will also deliver a speech on the 26th of this month. In addition to extending the King's intentions, he will also explain Italy's willingness to wait for France to make some expressions. What is unknowable is how he will phrase it." The right-wing "Le Temps" reported, "Those in France who praised the Munich Agreement have already suffered tragically six months ago, and now they want to exclude the Soviet Union and obstruct its participation in the British plan. This is an even more serious mistake." The Radical Socialist "L'Œuvre" also commented on the Italian King's decree, saying, "Prime Minister Mussolini will deliver a speech on the 26th of this month. How he phrases it is a major mystery. Although we are still willing to negotiate with Italy, we must be careful not to fall into their trap." The Socialist "Le Populaire" commented on the British government's actions, saying, "Although we have no objection to Prime Minister Chamberlain, we are happy to praise Foreign Secretary Halifax. This man has courage, keen insight, and a calm mind. These strengths have been tested by the Czechoslovakian issue and are well-known. If world peace is ultimately preserved, the contribution of Foreign Secretary Halifax cannot be denied." (Havas, 24th)

### Germany and Poland Can Temporarily Live in Peace; Poland Still Decides to Strictly Adhere to Neutrality; Collective Security System in Eastern Europe Suffers Setback

Warsaw: Poland has recalled some reserve soldiers and specialists from 1914 and 1925 to active duty. It is heard that this move aims to strengthen the defense of the northern land. (Reuters, 24th)

(Berlin) Political figures here recently declared that the current situation in the Free City of Danzig will not change. Although it has not been incorporated into German territory, Germans already enjoy various rights there. Although annexation by Germany would enhance its prestige, it could also cause disputes with Poland, which Germany does not want. The only question now is how to connect East Prussia with western Germany, which are separated by the Polish Corridor. This issue will be submitted for discussion before the end of this year, but a solution will be sought based on the spirit of the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, so as to avoid any adverse impact on relations between the two countries. (Havas, 24th)

Warsaw: Regarding the issue of a collective security organization in Eastern Europe, the governments of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union planned to issue a joint declaration in the short term, but Poland does not want to participate in it. The twists and turns in this process are noteworthy. The content of this declaration was explained by British Ambassador Sir Kennard to Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, but Foreign Minister Beck considered the quality to be insufficient, meaning that the relevant countries must accept more concrete constraints politically, and especially militarily, for the declaration to be meaningful. In addition, the Romanian authorities have signed a supplementary commercial agreement with Germany. After this, the Romanian economy is actually controlled by Germany. Regarding this matter, the Polish authorities originally hoped that Britain could take some action to dispel this German attempt, but Britain did nothing. The Polish authorities' unwillingness to participate in the joint declaration is mainly due to these two reasons. In addition, after the Slovak State became a German protectorate and the Memel region was returned to Germany, Poland's situation became increasingly difficult. It had to find its own way to survive, and strictly adhere to neutrality between the anti-German group and the Berlin-Rome political axis. The Polish authorities also have the view that the Eastern European issue has already been satisfactorily resolved according to the will of German Führer Hitler. Germany may then turn to Western Europe to complete its plan. In this way, the Polish authorities believe that it is more advantageous to maintain their original diplomatic policy and maintain a detached attitude. This is another reason why Poland does not participate in the joint declaration. (Havas, 24th)

Warsaw: The "Polish Gazette" (organ of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) published an editorial today explaining the country's diplomatic policy and commenting on the efforts of Western European countries to restore the balance of power in Central Europe, believing that cooperation with the Soviet Union is not a foolproof solution. It said: Poland will not participate in any group, nor will it initiate the organization of any group. Poland must firmly adhere to its own path, move forward, develop its strength, strengthen national defense, and promote its economy. Poland has no territorial demands at present, nor does it intend to place other countries under its protection to expand its influence, but the integrity of its territory must be respected, and the interests it holds in areas close to its borders must not be ignored or abandoned. (Havas, 24th)

### Germany and Japan Have Not Signed a Military Alliance: Berlin's Statement

(Berlin) Responsible officials here solemnly deny rumors that Germany and Japan have signed a military alliance treaty. (Havas, 24th)

(Berlin) Germany signed a friendship treaty with "Manchukuo" on May 12 of last year. The German Minister to "Manchukuo," Mr. Wagner, signed a commercial agreement with the Prime Minister of "Manchukuo," Zhang Jinghui, in Changchun today, based on the most-favored-nation clause, in accordance with this treaty. (Havas, 24th)

### Ten American Churches Bombed

Local news: The American Embassy in Beiping has protested to the Japanese side regarding the recent bombing of American churches by Japanese planes. According to investigations, American church properties have been bombed by Japanese planes in as many as ten places this month.

### 米美爾區　劃入東普魯士　英所受商業影響甚大　美對米美爾貨亦增稅

(Berlin) Führer Hitler, on board the destroyer "Leopard," departed from Memel Port at 4 PM today. Before his departure, he placed the port's artillery battery under the jurisdiction of the German Navy. (Havas, 23rd)

(Berlin) Führer Hitler signed the law merging the Memel Region with Germany on the battleship "Deutschland." The law stipulates that the Memel Region shall be under the jurisdiction of the East Prussia Province. German and Prussian laws shall take effect in the Memel Region from May 1st. Governor Koch of East Prussia Province is appointed as the temporary commissioner of the Memel Region, with Dr. Neumann, the leader of the Germans in the region, as the deputy commissioner. The law also stipulates that all Memel residents shall be German citizens from March 22, 1939. (Haitong, 24th)

(London) After the return of the Memel Autonomous Region to Germany, well-informed sources here commented that the impact on British commerce would be profound. In 1938, Lithuanian goods imported into the UK through Memel Port totaled £3,000,000, while British goods exported to Lithuania totaled £2,000,000. Now that Memel Port is controlled by Germany, trade between Britain and Lithuania will inevitably cease completely. Military experts stated that the British Isles rely heavily on the Baltic Sea countries and Denmark for food. With the Memel Autonomous Region under German control, Germany has gained a base in the Baltic Sea. In the event of war, it might further control Denmark and the Baltic Sea countries, which could interrupt the food supply to the United Kingdom, causing great concern. According to well-informed sources, the British government plans to purchase and stockpile a large amount of food in various locations to ensure security. (Havas, 23rd)

(Washington) President Roosevelt issued an order today stating, "The commercial treaty between the United States and Czechoslovakia, although still valid, has been temporarily suspended because the country is currently occupied by German and Hungarian troops." The preferential tariff rates stipulated in this treaty shall be completely abolished from April 22nd. (Havas, 23rd)

(Washington) Under Secretary of State Welles told reporters that the Lithuanian Minister had delivered a note to the State Department stating that the Memel Autonomous Region had been returned to Germany. The U.S. government regrets that it has no choice but to acknowledge this fait accompli. The State Department has forwarded this note to the Treasury Department, instructing customs authorities to levy additional taxes on goods from the Memel Region, treating them in the same manner as German imports. (Havas, 23rd)

Cambridge The American "Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists, and Technicians" a group composed of nationally renowned scientists, has decided to boycott scientific instruments manufactured in Germany. According to Sherman, the president of the branch, the losses suffered by Germany as a result of this will amount to a staggering $8 million annually. (Havas, 24th)

### German-Romanian Trade Agreement Signed: Romania Makes Significant Concessions; Germany to Assist in Developing Agriculture and Mining

(Berlin) According to news from the capital of Romania, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu and Commerce Minister Bujoiu, together with German Minister Fabricius and Economic Ministry representative Walter, signed a commercial supplementary agreement today and issued a formal communiqué stating, "Romania's production volume must be increased. Once increased, it can find sales in neighboring countries, especially in Greater Germany. This has been agreed upon by the German and Romanian governments. Germany will use its resources to assist the Romanian government in agriculture and forestry, and sell appropriate industrial machinery to Romania. In short, both parties should systematically cooperate economically on a larger scale, taking into account Germany's import trade needs and Romania's potential for production development. In addition, the position of Romanian exports in other countries should also be considered." (Havas, 23rd)

Romanian Capital The German-Romanian economic agreement was signed here yesterday, stipulating that various plans will be implemented gradually over the years: (1) To revitalize various Romanian industries, such as agriculture, forestry, mining, and oil, Germany will purchase large quantities of various products. (2) Germany and Romania will jointly establish an oil company to develop Romania's oil resources. (3) Germany will regularly supply Romania with machinery and armaments for industrial and military improvements. (4) To open up transportation and improve transportation services. (5) Romania will designate a free zone in the port area to provide Germany with space to build warehouses, docks, and commercial agencies. (Haitong, 24th)

(Berlin) The main points of the commercial supplementary agreement recently signed between Germany and Romania are as follows: (1) Romania should maximize the development of agriculture, forestry, textiles, and the planting of oilseeds (especially soybeans). (2) Germany should sell mining machinery to Romania and establish joint ventures to mine copper in the Dobruja region, manganese in the Banat region, and aluminum in the Vatra Dornei and Borod districts. (3) Romania and Germany should jointly exploit oil and manage sales. (4) The Romanian army's military equipment should be supplied by Germany. (5) Once this agreement is ratified, the instruments of ratification should be exchanged as soon as possible in Berlin, and the agreement should be implemented one month later. (6) The agreement is valid until March 31, 1944. Either signatory country may announce its termination one year before the expiration date; otherwise, the term will be automatically extended. If either party wishes to announce termination after that, it must notify the other party three months in advance. (Havas, 23rd)

(London) The German-Romanian trade agreement, signed today, is very broad in nature, with the development of Romania's potential resources, especially in agriculture, as its main feature. It is reported that Germany will provide its commercial experience for Romania's adoption and undertake to supply industrial necessities. Romania's productivity is expected to expand greatly. Attention will also be paid to forests. Germany will provide Romania with machinery and mining equipment and organize joint German-Romanian companies to mine oil, copper, chromium, and manganese. Iron ore and aluminum industries will also be established. In addition, the supply of military supplies for the Romanian army, navy, and air force, and the Romanian arms industry are also specified. After signing the agreement, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu stated that if other countries are willing, the Romanian government is also prepared to sign similar agreements. According to political circles in the Romanian capital, Romania still retains economic independence, but Romania has now agreed to a greater extent than it was originally willing to agree to. German sources refer to this agreement as a "German-Romanian Five-Year Plan." Germany has stated to Romania that the armaments and ammunition ordered by Romania from the Skoda factory in Bohemia before Germany occupied Czechoslovakia will be delivered on schedule. (Reuters, 23rd)

Romanian Capital After the conclusion of the Romanian-German commercial supplementary agreement, Foreign Minister Gafencu gave a speech commenting that Romania loves peace and is willing to help the Danube region countries stabilize the situation, as can be seen from this move. In addition, the necessity of our country to develop trade with other countries has also been taken into consideration. We are now prepared to sign similar agreements with other countries, stating that the security of our borders and the independence of national sovereignty must be maintained. (Havas, 23rd)

Romanian Capital The Romanian-German commercial supplementary agreement was signed yesterday. In the opinion of political circles, everyone said that there is nothing alarming about this agreement. The newspapers mostly commented on Foreign Minister Gafencu's speech last night, viewing it as a necessary measure to consolidate peace and change the situation in Central Europe. However, some people also believe that the content of the agreement only formulates various principles, and there are still many problems with the technical details, which must be determined by other means. The only thing that can be asserted is that the Romanian government has never given Germany any exclusive rights. In addition, although the authorities are afraid that Britain and France will no longer be able to compete with Germany in Romanian trade in the future, political figures still hope that the two major democratic countries of Britain and France will adopt a positive attitude so that Romania can still maintain its economic independence. (Havas, 24th)

Romanian Capital A large part of the Romanian population, especially Jewish business leaders, expressed unease about the new German-Romanian trade agreement. However, official circles stated that Romania's economic independence has not been impaired by this agreement. This agreement does not prevent Romania from concluding agreements with the same wording with other countries. The newspaper spoke according to the official intention, saying that now that economic compromise has been established, political tensions will inevitably ease. (Reuters, 24th)

(Berlin) Romanian trade ranks first in imports and exports to Germany, second in imports to Czechoslovakia, and third in exports. Therefore, in 1938, Germany accounted for 55% of Romania's total imports and 40% of total exports. Now that Czechoslovakia has been annexed by Germany, the economic relationship between Germany and Romania can be seen from this. (Haitong, 24th)

### 德與斯洛伐克　簽訂恊定　規定保護辦法
### Germany and Slovakia Sign Agreement Stipulating Protection Measures

(Berlin) Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Slovak Premier Tiso signed an agreement this afternoon placing Slovakia under German political and military protection. The full text consists of five articles: (1) The political independence and territorial integrity of Slovakia shall be protected by Germany. (2) Germany may construct fortifications and occupy, and exercise military sovereignty in all areas of western Slovakia located west of the Little Carpathian Mountains, the White Carpathian Mountains, and the Javorníky Mountains at any time. Existing fortifications in these areas shall be used by the German army. Supplies required by the German army shall be exempt from import duties. (3) The Slovak government may organize an army with the full consent of Germany. (4) Slovakia may send envoys to foreign countries, but shall pursue its foreign policy with the constant consent of the German government. (5) This agreement shall enter into force from the date of signature and shall be valid for a period of twenty-five years. Both parties may contact each other before the expiration date to extend it. (Havas, 23rd)

Warsaw The Polish Post has published a speech by Slovak Premier Tiso, stating that "Slovakia does not intend to join the League of Nations, and will not sign or participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact except to support it in spirit. In the future, Slovakia will establish embassies in the capitals of Germany, Italy, the United States, Poland, Hungary, and the Vatican, and may extend this to Paris later. The main responsibilities of these embassies are to handle commercial and cultural issues, and they will not be given diplomatic missions for the time being. As for the politics of this country, only one party will be allowed to form, and all ethnic minorities will be incorporated into it, but Jews will not be allowed to participate in any economic or cultural work."

### 法義談判　若接若離
### Franco-Italian Negotiations: On and Off

(Paris) French newspapers continue to carry news of the possibility of informal contacts between France and Italy. (Reuters, 23rd)

(Paris) King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy's speech today in the Fascist Corporate Council has been commented on by responsible persons here, saying that the French government is still prepared to reopen negotiations with Italy, but the status of Italian residents in French Tunisia, North Africa, must be based on what was stipulated in the 1935 Franco-Italian agreement. At this time, certain countries often use the fact that their own ethnic minorities reside in foreign places as an excuse to claim the necessity of annexing these places. If the French government grants autonomous rights to the Italian minority in Tunisia, it is not a safe way. In addition, according to the 1935 Franco-Italian agreement, France promised to cede certain places bordering Tunisia and Italian Libya, certain places bordering French Somaliland and Italian East Africa, and a certain small French island in the Red Sea to Italy. In the future, France's territorial concessions to Italy should still be limited to this. As for the management issue of the French commercial railway from the port of Djibouti in French Somaliland to Addis Ababa, it can be modified with reference to the current situation in East Africa. Certain conveniences can also be given to Italian commerce in the port of Djibouti. (Havas, 23rd)

Prague Slovakia has sent a formal note to the Hungarian government protesting the Hungarian military invasion and demanding a satisfactory response within hours. Slovakia has also notified Berlin of the Hungarian military action, but it is still unknown whether it has requested assistance. The Slovak army is currently resisting the Hungarian military attack, and small-scale battles have reportedly occurred, with casualties on both sides. Aircraft flew in the Slovak sky today, but did not drop bombs. (Reuters, 23rd)

Slovak Capital Hungarian troops entered Slovakia yesterday and occupied several towns. According to official sources here, Slovak Premier Tiso signed an agreement with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday placing Slovakia under German protection. Afterwards, the Hungarian government apologized to the Slovak authorities for sending troops into the country and stated that it had ordered these troops to withdraw completely within 24 hours. It is now known that Hungarian troops have indeed been successively leaving the country since this morning, and the two towns of Gelnica and Sobrance occupied by them have been taken over by Slovak troops. (Havas, 24th)

Slovak Capital The Hungarian government has proposed to the Slovak government that a joint commission be organized to delineate the border between the two countries. This was discussed at today's Slovak cabinet meeting. The cabinet members unanimously agreed to reject it, saying that the borders of Slovakia are exactly the same as the borders of the Slovak province of the former Czech Republic, and there is no change, so there is no need to re-delineate it. (Havas, 24th)

Prague Hungarian mechanized units, under the cover of tanks, entered Slovakia from the Carpathian Ruthenia province to a distance of 15 kilometers, occupying several villages and towns, shooting down one Slovak plane. A Hungarian officer also told Colonel Hudega, the commander of Slovakia, that the Hungarian army had obtained the consent of German Führer Hitler and therefore entered the country. The Slovak army, numbering about 2,000, retreated once and then launched a counterattack, making contact with the Hungarian army again. Certain sources here say that the Slovak army is weak and unable to stop the Hungarian army's advance, and Germany may need to intervene. (Havas, 23rd)

Hungarian Capital According to an official announcement, the government has received a telegram from Slovak Foreign Minister Durčanský protesting the Hungarian military's entry into Slovakia. Foreign Minister Csáky replied immediately, promising to conduct an immediate investigation, and said that because the eastern border of Slovakia had not yet been delineated, disputes easily arose between military officers on both sides. It is not true that Hungary took military action after obtaining German consent. The official then issued a statement acknowledging that the Hungarian army had indeed occupied several places on the west bank of the Ing River. Hungary will form a joint committee with Slovakia to delineate the border. (Havas, 23rd)

Prague Hungarian troops entered Slovakia in three routes yesterday evening, and occupied Gelnica, Sodovce, and Vyšný Hrabovec before noon today. At 2 PM, they began to withdraw from Slovakia. Although a small number of troops had not yet withdrawn by the evening, the Slovak troops who had gone to the border to prepare for battle had been ordered to return to the base in Prešov, which shows that the matter has been resolved.

(Washington) According to the current Silver Purchase Act, the President enjoys various privileges in silver purchase policy. This law will expire at the end of June this year. The Senate Silver Committee has submitted a draft to extend the validity of the Silver Purchase Act for discussion. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Eccles attended and gave a speech, criticizing the government's policy of purchasing foreign silver, saying, "The result of this policy is to weaken the domestic silver mines and increase the reserve of banks." (Havas, 23rd)

(Washington) The Senate Finance Committee had asked many questions about the current monetary policy, requesting a response. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau sent a note to Senator Wagner, Chairman of the Committee, stating (1) The continued influx of large amounts of gold into the United States in recent months is very satisfactory. (2) The value of the U.S. dollar remains at the rate of $35 per ounce of gold. (3) Although the United States has as much as $15,000,000,000 in gold reserves, "due to unstable international political and economic conditions," the U.S. Treasury Department has no need to intervene to reduce gold reserves. (4) Opposing the restoration of the gold standard for two reasons: first, the U.S. dollar cannot be exchanged for cash, and second, the government has the power to control gold transactions and change the value of the U.S. dollar. As for the President's power to change the value of the U.S. dollar, this measure is sufficient to prevent speculation and should be maintained. In short, the global currency turmoil is not controlled by the United States. The only impact of this turmoil on the United States is that foreign gold comes in droves, proving the world's deep faith in the U.S. dollar, which no other currency can match. However, if too much gold flows in, the United States and the rest of the world will lose balance, which is what we are worried about. Fortunately, we have sufficient power to prevent major blows to the domestic currency system, and the President's power to change the value of the U.S. dollar has been very successful in stabilizing finance in the past.

### Ganzi, Xikang: Dajin Temple Case Resolved; Seven Articles of Resolution Signed

Kangding News: The long-unresolved Dajin Temple case was resolved at the end of last year after the special commissioner Zhang Zhenzhong, dispatched by the former Xikang Provincial Construction Committee to mediate the Ganzi case, and Daiben Wangqing, the special representative dispatched by the Tibetan Kashag, together with Fan Changyuan, the director of Kang-Tibet negotiations, various representatives of Ganzi, and representatives of Dengke and Dajin Temple, held repeated meetings in Gengqing, Dege. After more than forty days, they finally agreed on the detailed

Seven articles of regulations for resettling good Dajin monks. After the closing ceremony, they were signed, and seven copies were written, all in both Chinese and Tibetan. The contents are roughly: (1) Repair Dajin Temple, (2) Zhuwo, Lin Chongjiao, and Laolong three villages are placed under the jurisdiction of the Ganzi County Government, (3) The temple monks will compensate 700 taels of silver for the goods robbed from Gan, (4) The Tibetan side will issue firearms to Dajin Temple, and the Tibetan side will recover all of them, (5) The temple monks will compensate 50 taels of silver for burning the Dengke County Government and various stockades, (6) The living Buddha who should be appointed by Dajin Temple must first notify the Kang Provincial Government of his name and obtain its consent before being appointed by Tibet, (7) The procedures for Dajin Temple and Dajin monks and other parties will be resolved in a legal manner after the monks return to the temple. These seven measures have been approved by the superiors of both parties, and the case

is thus resolved. Dajin Temple is located in Rongba Cha, Ganzi County, with magnificent construction. There are nearly 2,000 monks in the temple, belonging to the Yellow Sect, with seven great lamas. Important matters must be decided by the seven great lamas before they can be implemented. Among them, the most prestigious Zuo Tan Lama is selected as the Adu Buddha Duduo, who is in charge of all internal and external affairs of the entire temple and has the power to command all the lamas in the temple. Dajin Temple has abundant temple property, and there are full-time stewards, lamas, who operate in major markets in Kang and Tibet, dealing in furs, medicinal materials, and other industries, and providing loans to Manchu merchants to do business. Its wealth is greater than that of all temples in Kang. It is said that the

gold and silver stored can provide ten years of salary for the garrison troops in all of Kang. The occurrence of this tragic incident was initially due to the fact that Baili Tusi Deng Dejin complained to Dajin Temple about the robbery of food. The monks of Dajin Temple became angry at the merchants of Ganzi, and a conflict occurred between the two sides. Later, the Tibetan side also sent troops to join, and issued firearms to the temple monks, which led to the expansion of the situation and a bloody tragedy. It has not been resolved for several years, and the Dajin monks have endured the suffering of being displaced. The merchants of Ganzi often had concerns about their safety. Even Dege and the counties along the Jinsha River in between were also affected.

The long-standing case has now been resolved satisfactorily through the responsible officials and representatives of Kang and Tibet being open and honest with each other. In the future, the people of Gan and Jin may be able to abandon their old grievances and enhance their feelings. Luo Jiangce, the steward lama (known as Da Xiba in Kang dialect) stationed in Dajin Temple, recently paid a special visit to Chairman Liu to pay his respects. He expressed his deep gratitude to the government for resolving the Dajin case and allowing all the monks in the temple to avoid being displaced. He also expressed his determination to support Chairman Liu in building a new Xikang in the future. Although the reporter felt that Luo was not the official representative of Adu Buddha Duduo of Dajin Temple, but as a steward lama, he was able to

express gratitude to the authorities. He decided to meet him. At 12:00 noon on the 9th, he went to the Provincial Government with the translator Xi to visit him. On the way, he chatted with Xi and learned that he was from Ya'an. Xi was about 30 years old, dressed in Manchu clothes, and his family lived in the furnace. He had been working as a translator for many years because he was proficient in both Chinese and Tibetan languages. Lama Luo Jiangce lived upstairs in the Yang family's pot village. The pot village was in a small, secluded alley. As soon as he entered the door, he saw horse manure and dirt scattered in the courtyard. Xi led the way up the stairs and into a room on the east side. Luo was sitting cross-legged on a bed blanket. When he saw Yu and others arrive, he quickly stood up. Xi

immediately introduced them and told Luo in Tibetan the reporter's intention. Luo was very humble and immediately offered the reporter a large plate of yellow rock sugar and presented snuff to the translator. The snuff was contained in a box made of animal horn. The reporter picked a piece of rock sugar and put it in his mouth to dissolve it. Xi, the translator, pressed the snuff on his nostrils with his fingernails and inhaled it, because the people of Kang are very fond of snuff. The light in the room was very dim, and there was a Tibetan-style teapot on the brazier. However, it was quite peculiar. There were an abacus and other things on the table. The sound of gongs and drums from the next door was deafening, because the local lamas were performing Buddhist services. At this time, the reporter and Luo

began to talk, translated by the translator Xi. The reporter asked when he came to the furnace. He replied that he came here in July last year and had been here for more than six months. During the conversation, he frequently pressed snuff on his nostrils with his fingers and inhaled it. When asked whether the lama represented Adu Buddha Duduo of Dajin Temple to handle affairs in the furnace, he replied, "No, I am the steward lama. I am here to do business, not to represent. Now that the Dajin Temple case has been resolved peacefully, the authorities in the temple will soon send an official representative here to pay their respects to Chairman Liu and report on the progress." The temple had previously sent someone to send a

leopard skin to thank the government for resolving the case and instructed Yu to present it respectfully to Chairman Liu. Yu's visit to the chairman the other day was to pay his respects for this purpose. At this time, the sound of drums and gongs from the next door became more intense, and it was almost impossible to speak. When asked what the real reason for the Dajin Temple tragedy was, he replied, "It was actually caused by the Baili Tusi, which led to a misunderstanding and conflict with the Gan side, which led to its expansion." As he said this, he pointed to the plate and asked the reporter to eat sugar. Yu humbly thanked him. When asked how many casualties and losses the Dajin Temple monks and the Gan side suffered in the conflict, he replied, "More than 200 monks were killed or injured, and the loss of property in the temple was worth about 10,000 taels of silver." When asked how many lamas were in the temple, he replied, "About 1,900 people can be gathered at any given time, but there are not actually that many at ordinary times." When asked how the lamas felt about the resolution of this case, he replied, "Since this case has been smoothly resolved by both parties agreeing on an agreement, so as to avoid the displacement of the monks in our temple, I am very grateful to the Kang Provincial Government." Then he took his leave and left.

### Sacred Conscription: Chairman Chiang Issues Order to All Provinces Prohibiting Payment for Exemption

Ningbo News: Chairman Chiang, considering that the method of paying for exemption from military service implemented in Zhejiang Province should not be established, specifically telegraphed all provincial military districts to inform them. The original telegram stated: "In a country with a conscription system, military service is sacred. Those who are liable for service are not allowed to pay for exemption, and those who are legally exempt should not be made to pay for exemption as an exception. This is one reason. The local administration and local autonomy in our country have not yet reached a perfect stage. If we implement an exceptional payment system, there will be a hundred harms and no benefits. This is the second reason. The preferential treatment of the families of fallen soldiers and the families of soldiers on expeditions is the duty of the state and must be borne by the state. It cannot be taken from a small number of legally exempt personnel. This is the third reason. Based on the above reasons, the method of paying for exemption from military service should not be established."

He has now returned to a certain place in eastern Zhejiang, personally leading elite troops to be stationed in a certain area.

### Food in Fujian Province Urgently Needs Regulation; Provincial Government Plans to Establish an Administration Bureau

Rice Prices Rise Sharply in Fuzhou and Quanzhou

Low Grain Prices Hurt Farmers in Eastern and Northern Fujian

Fuzhou Correspondence: Food prices in Fujian Province have been rising in recent months. The price per dan in Fuzhou has risen to sixteen yuan, and in Quanzhou, it has risen to eighteen yuan, which is an unprecedented phenomenon. The reason for this is the difficulty in transporting grain from the rice-producing areas of eastern and northern Fujian. Rice from eastern Fujian used to be exported by sea, but due to the Japanese naval blockade, it is now transported by land, which has increased transportation costs and delayed the time. Rice from northern Fujian is transported down the Min River, but due to the drought and shallow water, boats have difficulty traveling, and very few arrive. Therefore, there is a large surplus of rice among the people in the producing areas of northeastern Fujian, with each dan only worth five or six yuan, which is about three times less than in Fuzhou and Quanzhou. This has a significant impact on

Rural Economic Circulation. Due to the abundant autumn harvest in Jiangxi Province last year, there was a large surplus. A special commissioner was sent to Fujian last month to discuss exchanging Jiangxi rice for sugar and salt from this province. The Fujian Provincial Government decided to purchase sixteen packages, but they have not yet arrived. Recently, in order to regulate the food supply during the war, a provincial food administration bureau has been established in Fuzhou, responsible for circulating grain among the counties and balancing prices, adopting a policy of official supervision and merchant management, and official-merchant cooperation, taking into account both the capital of merchants and the livelihood of the people. Efforts are being made to reduce and facilitate transportation taxes and valuation and licensing matters. Representatives of rice merchants have been convened for discussions once to discuss specific measures for implementation. As for the current

Temporary Solution, the provincial government has allocated 50,000 yuan to Quanzhou, entrusting local gentry and merchants to organize price stabilization. For Fuzhou, a batch of rice stockpiled in a certain area of northern Fujian will be transported for sale first. 16,000 packages have been arriving successively on the 15th and 16th, and rice prices are expected to fall within a day or two. Therefore, the food problem in this province is not as serious as reported outside. However, the coastal areas, such as the Pinghai and Puxi districts of Putian County, and the Gaoshan and Longtian districts of Fuqing County, suffered crop failures due to drought last summer, and the people have been unable to go out to sea to fish due to the war, and many are without food. Recently, the Provincial Relief Association has allocated one million yuan for relief, and plans to move some fishermen to the interior for reclamation. In addition, the rice prices in the Chaozhou and Shantou prefectures of Guangdong Province have risen due to a lack of supply. Since the counties of Zhangpu and Yunxiao in Fujian have abundant reserves, a special request has been made for

Transportation to Guangdong for Relief. The authorities are still considering it. As for the amount of summer crops harvested in this province last year, it is about 70% or more of the normal year. In addition, daily necessities such as sesame oil, soybean oil, and rapeseed oil have traditionally come from various ports in northern China, such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Dalian, and Yingkou. Since the autumn, due to the Japanese control of oil exports, imports have sharply decreased, and prices have skyrocketed. The Provincial Agricultural Improvement Office promoted the planting of peanuts, soybeans, and rapeseed during the winter cultivation this year as raw materials for oil production, with great results. The office has now purchased new oil presses from Jiangxi and established factories in northern Fujian to achieve self-sufficiency. The remaining residue can also be used as fertilizer, which is a win-win situation.

### Eight Counties in Northern Jiangsu Establish Joint Defense Headquarters

Chinese Troops Capture Huaian and Attack Shaobo

Xinghua Correspondence: Considering that the Japanese army is invading south, and the counties in the Lixiahe region are important, and that close communication and convenient command are necessary to achieve success, the Jiangsu Provincial Government convened a meeting of eight counties in a certain county a few days ago. It was resolved to establish a joint defense headquarters for the eight counties of Huaian, Baoying, Gaoyou, Taixian, Yancheng, Xinghua, Dongtai, and Funing. Commissioner Jin of the Sixth District was appointed by the provincial government as the commander, and Commissioner Chen of the Fifth District as the deputy commander. After receiving the appointment, Commissioners Jin and Chen have notified the counties by telegram and took office immediately. The headquarters is temporarily located in Yancheng. In addition to unifying the training of the local forces in the eight counties within the defense area, it also plans to mobilize the armed forces of the people of the eight counties to deal with the Japanese army.

Taixian Correspondence: The Chinese troops counterattacking Huaian arrived at the designated location on the 17th. At the same time, the troops of a certain army on the right wing advanced to the suburbs of Huaian and made contact with friendly forces. After actively counterattacking, they achieved successive victories. According to news from transportation circles here, Huaian was indeed recovered by the Chinese army on the morning of the 18th. A certain unit of the Chinese army launched a surprise attack on the Japanese army in Shaobo at around 12 o'clock the night before. The Japanese army was panicked and fired artillery shells as a show of force, and fired machine guns aimlessly. By dawn, the Chinese army had safely returned to its original defense after achieving its mission. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses in ammunition.

Xinghua Correspondence: At about 3:00 PM on the 15th, three Japanese heavy bombers flew from the coast to Yancheng, circled for several weeks, and dropped six bombs, all of which landed outside the northern suburbs, causing little damage. Then they flew towards Xinghua. The local air defense authorities heard the sound of the planes and issued an alarm. As a result, they did not pass through the county seat but went to Dongtai instead.

### Changshu After the Fall: Chinese Troops Active

Constantly Controling the Northwest Countryside

Changshu Correspondence: The northwest countryside of Changshu has a wide area, neighboring Wuxi and Jiangyin, including the towns of Dahe, Wangzhuang, Dayiqiao, Xiaoyiqiao, Gangkou, Tianzhuang, Xixushi, Xitangqiao, Langanqiao, Xitangshi, Luyuan, Miaoqiao, Huangqiao, and Jinfeng, Donglai, Xigang, Donggang, Nanfeng, and Nanzhen in Shazhou City, District 7. Since Changshu fell on November 24, 1937, only the northwest countryside has always been completely under the control of guerrillas.

After the Fall, the guerrilla forces initially moving in the northwest countryside included the 5th, 6th, and 60th detachments of the Loyal Patriotic Army. Last summer was the most active period for the guerrillas. During this period and in this area, traitors had no place to stand. Although the puppet organization appointed puppet district chiefs for the 4th and 7th districts, they were unable to implement the decrees of the puppet organization. Qian Shuchen, the chief of the 4th district, was captured and shot by the Japanese army for assisting the guerrillas. After this, the puppet organization re-appointed Qu Huanru as the puppet district chief of the 4th district. Qu, fearing the guerrillas, set up the puppet 4th district office in Gangkou Town and dared not be blatant. Therefore, the puppet organization's administration of everything in the northwest countryside was always shelved. At that time, the Japanese army was also too busy to take care of it due to the tense war situation on the front line.

Repeated Contacts: It was not until after the fall of Wuhan that the Japanese and puppet forces in Changshu began to eliminate guerrilla forces in various parts of Changshu County and decided to "pacify" the east and "suppress" the west. The main force had several contacts in the area bordering Cheng and Yu, but the Japanese and puppet forces did not achieve complete victory. In October last year, in order to reorganize the administration of the occupied areas, the Jiangsu Provincial Government re-appointed Cai Runqi as the magistrate of Changshu County. Cai was a young soldier, shrewd and capable. After being appointed, he led about 1,500 soldiers of the Independent 2nd Detachment of the Jiangnan Advance Army of the Third War Area to Shazhou City in Changshu County, set up a county government office, promoted administration, and appointed district chiefs. The flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flew brightly over the northwest countryside. At the same time, the Japanese and puppet forces felt even more uneasy. They decided to adopt a meticulous and comprehensive encirclement strategy in two weeks, transferring Japanese troops from Wuxian, Wuxi, and Jiangyin, supplemented by a considerable number of puppet troops, to the northwest countryside, and stationed them in Luyuan Town in the 4th district. In order to avoid being surrounded, the Loyal Patriotic Army retreated to the Chengxi area. The county government also moved away from the Shazhou City area.

Puppet Retraction: In this scene, the most active in running errands for the puppet side were Qu Huanru and Wang Daohua. After the Japanese army stationed in Luyuan Town, they forced Qian Xianfu, a resident of the town, to serve as the puppet director of Luyuan Town. At the same time, they invited Qian Changshi to come forward and take charge. Before the Japanese army occupied Luyuan, Qian was the commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 6th Detachment of the Loyal Patriotic Army. He fled once when the Japanese army arrived in the town. He was tempted by profit and heard that the Japanese and puppet forces were recruiting, so he became the commander of the puppet 4th District Self-Defense Force. However, his troops, which originally only had one company, were also handed over to the Japanese army for verification. After only a few days, a man named Pang Yun from Xitangqiao, who was originally a guerrilla captain under Yang Xingfang, was extremely angry at Qian Changshi's behavior. On the second day of last month, Pang secretly arrived at Xitangqiao, ascertained the location of Qian's troops. On this evening, Pang held a box gun in both hands and led three men in disguise, rushed to Qinjiadang. Qian Changshi was caught off guard and two light machine guns and nine rifles were seized on the spot. After this battle, the traitors began to retract slightly.

Chinese Troops Active: Although the 5th and 6th detachments of the Loyal Patriotic Army, which had retreated to the vicinity of Yangshe in Jiangyin last year, had temporarily withdrawn, they were actively engaged at all times. A team of the 5th Detachment once sneaked into Donglai Town on the 3rd, killed a Japanese soldier with a box gun, and escaped with the gun in the hands of the Japanese soldier. Later, they all mobilized and opened up between the horns of Tianzhuang, Miaoqiao, and Xitangqiao via Langanqiao, etc., with about 1,200 people, complete with small cannons and light and heavy machine guns. As this team approached Luyuan, the Japanese army stationed in Luyuan was greatly alarmed and urgently asked the city for assistance. The entire 5th and 6th detachments opened up in front of Heyang Mountain between Tianzhuang and Xixushi, preparing to fight. At the same time, the Japanese army in the city and the Japanese army in Beiguo Luyuan also pressed closer and closer to Heyang Mountain. For a while, the sound of machine guns was as dense as a string of beads. The Loyal Patriotic Army charged bravely, killing more than a dozen Japanese soldiers. After an hour of fierce fighting, the sound of gunfire gradually subsided, and the guerrillas retreated in an orderly manner after achieving their mission. The Japanese army did not dare to pursue after suffering heavy losses. The Japanese army originally stationed in Luyuan secretly moved to Xitangqiao to prevent being attacked by the guerrillas again. Recently, the Japanese army stationed in various parts of the northwest countryside of Changshu included Luyuan, Donglai Town, Yaheqiao, Shiyixigang, and Beiguo, and the installation of telephone lines has been completed.

### Zhou Enlai Arrives in Jinhua, Then Proceeds to the Front for Inspection

Jinhua Correspondence: Zhou Enlai, Deputy Minister of the Political Department of the Military Commission, arrived in Zhejiang from Anhui on the morning of the 17th. The reporter paid a special visit at about 7 o'clock. According to him, his ancestral home is Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and he was born in Huaiyin, Jiangsu. This is his first time on his native soil, and he felt very gratified. As for the mission of coming here, it is to represent Minister Chen in attending the political work conference of a certain war zone, and to meet with Chairman Xiong of Jiangxi Province and Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province to discuss official business, and to go to the front line for inspection by the way. He left Chongqing on the 16th of last month, and it has been a month now. He stayed on the front line in southern Anhui for about two weeks, observing that the Japanese army's conspiracy is to consolidate the occupied areas, build bunkers, and use the flat ground and intersecting rivers to "clean up" our guerrilla forces. At the same time, they are strengthening their political and economic aggression steps to cooperate with their military actions, such as absorbing as much tea and rice from Anhui Province and silk from Jiangsu Province as possible, to exchange for foreign exchange, in order to realize their attempt to use our country's financial resources to kill our people. This is the new conspiracy of the Japanese after their failure to quickly resolve the war against us in the first phase of the war. In the future, their line of attack will probably focus on the northwest. However, our army is equipped with strong forces, and at the same time, it is limited by the natural danger of the Yellow River and the constraints of our troops in Hebei and Shanxi. Once they advance, replenishment will not be easy, and they dare not take this great risk. The date of my stay in Zhejiang will be decided after consulting with Chairman Huang by telegram, and I also plan to take the time to return to my ancestral home in Shaoxing for a visit. After finishing my work in Zhejiang, I will go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Xiong, and then return to Chongqing.

### Xu Chunshan's Troops Revolt; Chinese Troops Capture Chongde; Japanese Squad Leader Killed

Jiaxing Correspondence: The Japanese army's Koizumi unit and the puppet pacification commanders Xu Pu cheng and Xu Chunshan's troops launched an attack on the new Chinese positions on March 16, encountering the mobile unit of Zhu Xi's Chinese troops in Xiaowu Town and Lutou. The Japanese vanguard was the puppet army of Xu Chunshan, but Xu Chunshan, knowing the great righteousness, feigned fighting against the Chinese army. Then, taking advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness, he shouted, "We Chinese will turn our guns to fight the enemy," and immediately revolted, and together with the Chinese army, they successfully recovered key areas such as Xincheng, Lianshi, Chongde, Shiwan, and Tudian Temple. In this battle, more than 160 Japanese soldiers were killed and wounded. The Japanese squad leader Nakamura was killed on the spot, and a traitor named He was captured and has been executed.

### Xiang Army Tao Guang's Troops Rush to Defend Fuchun River Day and Night; Elite Fifth Division Arrives at Designated Location; Linshan Bombed; South Bank of Qiantang River Cleared

Regarding the war in eastern Zhejiang, the Zhejiang merchants in this port are extremely concerned. According to correspondence from Hangzhou, more than 1,000 Japanese troops here, and about 2,000 Japanese soldiers newly transferred from Shanghai and other places, were transferred to Fuyang and other places starting from the afternoon of the 21st. More than 120 large and small motorboats manufactured by the puppet organization were also transported by the Japanese to the area along the river. According to reliable information, the Japanese troops transferred to Fuyang, at dawn on this day, took more than 20 motorboats and secretly crossed the Fuchun River, landing in ××× area. The Chinese army Liu Jianxu's troops immediately launched a fierce artillery attack, and the two sides engaged in a fierce battle for three hours. Later, the Chinese army feigned defeat, and the Japanese army took advantage of the victory to penetrate deep, resulting in the temporary fall of ×××. After a certain Chinese officer had completed preparations for the rear road on the Japanese side, he launched a large-scale encirclement and gave a severe blow. At this time, the Japanese side knew that they had fallen into a trap, so they tried several times to break the encirclement and escape, but it was no longer possible. The Japanese warships that invaded Zhenhai are still gathered outside the port, and intermittently bombard the Chinese fortresses, but aimlessly, and the shells all fall into the wilderness, so the Chinese positions have not been damaged at all. As for the Japanese troops who invaded the south bank of the Qiantang River, some of them secretly crossed the river by motorboat under the cover of smoke bombs on the morning of the 20th, and most of them crossed the Qiantang River Bridge by setting up wooden boards. The Chinese army along the river heard the news and immediately concentrated firepower to bombard them, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers and destroying part of the bridge. Other Japanese troops who detoured by motorboat managed to land under the fire of planes and artillery. The Chinese army took advantage of the superior terrain to engage in a bloody battle with the Japanese army, and several times engaged in close combat. Finally, due to strategic considerations, the positions were slightly moved back. On this day, the Chinese army launched counterattacks on both the front and rear routes, and used the mountains to strike downward. Fierce battles have now broken out in areas such as the Liuhe Pagoda, and clear gunfire can be heard in the urban area, so the ordinary people and traitors are all panicked. It is also known that the Chinese troops in eastern Zhejiang have gathered in various key points, waiting to annihilate the Japanese, and the able-bodied young men in each defense area have completed their arming a few days ago, and have automatically asked the authorities to defend their homeland. Therefore, it is expected that the Japanese side's attempt to invade eastern Zhejiang, in an attempt to open up the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and cut off the retreat of the Chinese troops in western Zhejiang and other places, will definitely fail.

### Chinese Troops Counterattack and Recover Shazhou

According to a telegram from Ningbo from relevant parties, the Japanese army secretly crossed the Fuchun River and landed in Shazhou, and was met with fierce resistance from the Chinese army. The Japanese army was not stable on its feet and was annihilated in large numbers, but it continued to attack fiercely under the cover of Japanese warships. The Chinese army has transferred the Xiang army of Tao Guang's troops from the commander of the ×th Army Group to rush to the defense day and night. At the same time, the elite Fifth Division of the Central Army has also been urgently dispatched and arrived at the designated location. A certain unit of the Chinese army crossed the Fuchun River from a certain place at dawn on the 23rd and counterattacked Shazhou, charging fiercely. After a fierce battle until 2:00 PM, Dongzhou was captured, and the remnants fled towards Zhoujiapu and Lingjiaqiao.

### Japanese Warships Bombard Linshanwei

At about 10:00 AM on the 21st, two Japanese warships sailed into the waters off Linshanwei, north of Yuyao, from Hangzhou Bay. At 12:10 PM, they suddenly opened fire and bombarded the coast near Linshanwei. The Chinese army did not return fire. The Japanese warships fired about twenty shells and then stopped. The shells all landed on the salt fields and in the wilderness, and at that time it was raining, which reduced their effectiveness, and there were no losses.

### Aircraft Carrier in Songmen Waters

In recent days, the counties along the coast of eastern Zhejiang have been harassed by Japanese planes and warships, but the Chinese army's defenses are solid and have never succeeded. At noon on the 21st, a Japanese aircraft carrier arrived in the waters of Songmen, Wenzhou, seemingly intending to spy on eastern Zhejiang. The Chinese military authorities have been closely monitoring it, but the Japanese warship's movements are erratic and constantly moving. Its purpose is entirely to confuse the Chinese army's vision and disrupt the rear.

### Chinese Army and Air Force Mobilizing at Any Time

It is also learned that the Chinese side was well prepared for the Japanese army's attempt to invade eastern Zhejiang. It is currently known that the number of troops stationed in various places is about one million, and the defense is extremely solid. The mechanized troops and mobile artillery units of Gu Zhutong, Commander of the Third War Area, have rushed to a certain place to stand by. Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of Zhejiang, is stationed in a certain place. At the same time, in addition to sending elite troops to defend, the central government has also transferred a large number of air forces to a certain place in western Zhejiang, ready to mobilize at any time to fight and sweep away the Japanese army.

### Wenzhou and Taizhou Announce Special Alert

Xu Zongwu, Commander and Commissioner of Wenzhou and Taizhou, issued a notice stating that since the outbreak of the war, the maritime situation has been unstable, and Japanese warships have been patrolling and spying in the waters of Wenzhou from time to time. For the sake of pacifying the locality, he has obeyed orders and announced martial law. In accordance with the provisions of Article 9, Paragraph 1 of the Martial Law Law, within the martial law area, any gatherings, associations, strikes, market strikes, and news, magazines, books, and various printed materials that are deemed to interfere with military affairs must be suppressed. He has recently issued a public notice, instructing all to be informed and not to violate it, lest they be arrested.

### Navigation and Transportation Not Obstructed

The situation in eastern Zhejiang was once tense due to the harassment of Japanese warships, but yesterday, except for the fighting along the Fuchun River, the other places, such as Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, Dinghai, and Xiangshan, were unusually calm. All foreign merchant ships on the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo lines are still sailing as usual on the scheduled dates, so there is no obstruction in terms of transportation.

### Ningbo and Wenzhou Merchants Resume Purchasing Goods

Since the situation in eastern Zhejiang became tense, the export trade in this city has also undergone drastic changes. Due to the difficulty of transportation on various routes after the war, and many have become occupied areas, the sales of goods have been greatly reduced. However, the passenger and cargo traffic to Ningbo and Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang has been active. Recently, due to the continuous bombardment of important towns on the coast of eastern Zhejiang by Japanese warships, many merchants in this port have received telegrams from merchants in Ningbo and Wenzhou to stop purchasing goods. For a time, the morale in the market was quite uneasy. It is now learned that the Ningbo and Wenzhou merchants have resumed purchasing goods since yesterday. Therefore, merchants are very eager to ship goods on ships sailing from Shanghai to these two ports.

### Japanese Side Vague About Puppet Police Intruding on Concession

Claiming "Puppets" are Auxiliary Personnel

Whether They Will be Employed in the Future is Undecided

The Continental News reports that Fessenden, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, protested to the Japanese authorities here because Chinese puppet constables were stationed on the bridges of the Public Concession, and the "Great Way" police were drilling in Hongkou Park. Placing these puppets from "Great Way" as sentries on the three bridges on the Suzhou River is an attempt to give these puppets "face." On the morning of Tuesday at 7 o'clock, puppets and Japanese sentries were stationed side by side at the bridgeheads, but four hours later,

They Were Removed Immediately. Whether this was the result of a protest by the authorities of the Public Concession, and the "Great Way" police held a drill in Hongkou Park last Saturday, was also strongly protested. When the Japanese spokesman met with reporters from various newspapers last night, he replied to questions and said that he did not know that the Municipal Council had protested to the leader of the Shanghai Consular Corps, and said that the Council had not protested to the Japanese diplomatic authorities. The embassy spokesman also said that the Chinese police involved in the Municipal Council's protest were used by the Japanese military authorities for police purposes,

Auxiliary Personnel. This is not an incident in which these Chinese police managed in the Public Concession. When asked if these "auxiliary personnel" would be allowed to wear uniforms similar to those worn by the puppet police of the "Great Way" in the future, the spokesman replied that he did not know the details. When asked if the Japanese army would re-employ puppet police, the spokesman replied that it depended on the need. When asked if the Japanese side employed them due to a lack of police force, the spokesman replied that there must be a practical reason for this move, which is not convenient to announce now. A reporter asked if this was done on instruction. The spokesman replied, "Yes."

### The Entire Baoshan County is a Scene of Devastation

Appealing for Rescue Due to Excessive Disaster

The Baoshan Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai stated that since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Baoshan has borne the brunt, and all the fields, houses, and residences in the county have been destroyed. More than 180,000 people have been displaced, and more than 30,000 people are in the war zone, which is particularly pitiful. Now, the county is a scene of devastation, with people crying for food. Moreover, the autumn harvest last year has been exhausted, and they are bound to become starving corpses. Although the Shanghai Zhiyuan Dharma Assembly, the Red Swastika Society, and the association have tried to provide relief last winter, due to the excessive disaster, very few people have received relief. The association, feeling powerless and unable to save them, is specially appealing to all charitable circles in Shanghai. If those who are kind and enthusiastic to provide rescue, the association can assist in distributing the relief to ensure that the victims can benefit. Please contact the association at 12 Gongguan Road, 2nd Floor (telephone 85821).

### Stimson Strenuously Promotes Non-Cooperation Movement Against Japan

Stimson's Telegram Replies to Important Groups in this City

Expressing Admiration for China's Loyal and Courageous Resistance

Because former US Secretary of State Stimson initiated the non-participation in the Japanese invasion committee, the important groups in this city telegraphed their congratulations. Now, Stimson's reply telegram is as follows: "I am gratified to learn of your telegram. I am deeply admired by the loyalty and courage of your country's military and civilians in resisting the war, as well as their firm belief in the final victory and world justice. We will make every effort to promote the non-cooperation movement against Japan, without interruption." Signed by Stimson.

### Deteriorating Situation in the Western District: Westerners Step Forward to Advocate

First Meeting of the Western District Association

Discussing Issues Such as Police Affairs and Sanitation

According to the Continental Daily, the Western District Association (outside the Public Concession), an organization formed by Westerners, held its first annual meeting last night (the 23rd). The chairman of the General Committee delivered an impromptu speech, highlighting several points, such as the deteriorating situation in the Western Shanghai residential area, the flourishing of gambling dens, and the proliferation of various crimes. Residents of the area are full of complaints and unable to find redress. During the meeting, a report was unanimously passed, approving a motion stating that the Association views the problems faced by the residents of the area with great concern, and requesting the committee to consider presenting resolutions to the upcoming taxpayers' meeting to address the following issues: (1) Adequate policing; (2) Sanitation, fire prevention, and other public health and public works matters; (3) Effective factory management; (4) Consultation and dialogue with any committees or other authorities appointed by the Municipal Council, to ensure proper management of the outer areas of Western Shanghai, with the participation of representatives from the Western District Association.

No Management in the Western District: The Chairman explained in his speech that we live in a relatively small area, including Shanghai, with no less than four different forms of management organizations, in fact, there are five. However, the areas currently not permitted for foreign residents can be temporarily disregarded. The Public Concession is managed by the Municipal Council, elected by taxpayers residing or having offices within its boundaries. The French Concession is managed by its Consul. The remaining areas, as well as the area west of the railway line (Hongqiao), are now nominally under Japanese management. From the western boundary of the Public Concession to the railway, and from Rockhill Road (transliteration) to the Suzhou Creek, is currently a shared area for anyone, although also within the defense zone of foreign troops, but the area lacks any centralized management and has no definite management organization. The worst aspect is that residents of the area have no say, pay taxes to the Municipal Council, but have no right to vote, no way to remedy existing problems, and no organization to express their opinions to the tax collectors. Although the tax collectors do not technically manage the area, they should certainly be responsible for ensuring that it is a healthy and legally habitable area.

Everything is Deteriorating: It is important to know that the general situation of the roads in the outer areas of the Western District is rapidly deteriorating. A year or two ago, the area was one of the most popular residential areas for middle and upper-class Chinese and foreigners in Shanghai. The few villages between the concession roads were orderly. Now, various forms of lawlessness and disorder are almost everywhere in the area. Traffic is congested on the roads, which are already unable to bear the heavy burden, leading to a state of disrepair. Sidewalks are obstructed by hawkers and food stalls, and mostly used as workplaces or markets. Small merchants and the poor are active everywhere. A large number of factories have been completed. Although factories may not actually endanger health, they are most opposed by residents and emit very unpleasant odors. The baking of rush mats along Rue Cardinal Mercier is one example. A large number of flimsy and unsanitary buildings have also been built. There is no doubt that these houses pose a fire hazard. Fire insurance premiums throughout the area have increased by 50%. Water supply is insufficient to cope with large fires. Although water consumption has greatly increased, water pipes have not increased simultaneously. The general water supply for application is actually insufficient.

Various Crimes are Rampant: Today, gambling dens are flourishing in the Western District, and various crimes are openly rampant, encouraged by people outside the boundaries who are not managed by the Municipal Council. The unsanitary conditions and overcrowding in various areas between the outer roads pose a great risk of spreading infectious diseases. The Municipal Council's Health Department has done much to improve the situation, but resources are insufficient and they have no power to take the severe measures that are truly needed. Members of the Association are familiar with these situations and understand the difficulties faced by the Municipal Council, as the Bureau must rely on the active assistance of the Consular Corps and military authorities. The committee has achieved much in curbing abuses and even preventing unpleasant factories and households. To achieve results, it is necessary to observe constantly and take immediate action. The Association now sincerely requests members to cooperate and report adverse conditions to the Association, so that it can negotiate with the parties concerned or relevant authorities.

### Japanese to Open Qingdao Today: Sweet Words to Deceive People

Claiming to Open the Yangtze River Based on This Principle

But When it Will be Opened Remains Uncertain

According to the Continental Daily, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy declared at a reception for reporters yesterday (the 23rd) that the Japanese authorities would allow foreign ships to berth along the wharves of Qingdao Outer Harbor from the 25th of this month. The news has been issued by the Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao, and a public notice has been issued stating that Qingdao is being reopened and hoping that third countries will understand the true intention of the Japanese government and cooperate in establishing the new order in East Asia that the Japanese government is now striving to pursue. The spokesman also said that, in line with the spirit expressed by the Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao,

Reopening the Yangtze River is Another Matter: In response to inquiries, the spokesman said that the Yangtze River was closed due to military needs, which is well known, but it will eventually be reopened for foreign shipping. As for the opening date, it cannot be specified at this time. The spokesman continued to state that the reopening of Qingdao Outer Harbor to provide berthing facilities for foreign ships was based on the statement issued by the Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao that, since the outbreak of the war, the Japanese government has expanded facilities to allow third countries to engage in peaceful

Commercial Activities: Although the results have been severely detrimental to Japanese military operations, this is a "well-known fact." In line with this policy, Qingdao Outer Harbor is being reopened for foreign merchant ships to enter and exit. Some say that closing the outer harbor and prohibiting merchant ships from entering and exiting is a discriminatory act or a closure of the "Open Door Policy," which is regrettable, as these restrictions are purely for military needs and in no way infringe upon the commercial rights of third countries or interfere with peaceful commerce. Therefore, the

Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao hopes that third countries will understand the true intention of the Japanese government due to the reopening of Qingdao and assist in establishing a new order in East Asia. The reporters then questioned the spokesman about the points expressed in the above-mentioned public notice regarding the Japanese government's intentions. One reporter asked, "In view of the restrictions on the establishment of a new economy in North China before the reopening of Qingdao, under these circumstances, is the opening of great value?" The spokesman replied, "This can be found in the statement issued by the Consul-General in Qingdao." Some asked the spokesman whether the emotions expressed by the Consul-General in Qingdao could be used to explain whether the Yangtze River could be reopened.

The Spokesman Replied: "The Yangtze River is closed due to military needs, which you are familiar with." One reporter asked, "Does this mean that the Japanese authorities assume that the Yangtze River will eventually be reopened?" The spokesman replied, "Yes, the Yangtze River will be opened, but we cannot say when it will be opened." One reporter asked, "The Qingdao statement clearly states that the Japanese government hopes to satisfy the hopes of third countries. Will the same principle be applied to the issue of reopening the Yangtze River?" The spokesman replied, "The same spirit will be applied to all areas where restrictions have been lifted." Regarding the facilities that will be provided to

Foreign Merchant Ships in Qingdao after the issuance of the public notice, the Japanese authorities in this port were unable to provide detailed reports last night. However, it was learned from responsible parties last night that foreign ships will be able to berth on the fourth line of Pier No. 1, so this concession will be very important to foreign shipping companies. It is also heard that if the Japanese side believes that the military situation requires the closure of the wharves at any time, it will be closed without notice, and navigation will not be allowed at night. The full text of the regulations for the partial reopening of the Port of Qingdao has been notified by the Japanese Consul-General to the foreign consulates in the area.

### Municipal Council Building: Yesterday's Security Was Tighter: This Measure is a Factual Necessity

The Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council building has been guarded by 40 members of the White Russian Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps for many days without incident. However, yesterday morning, the security situation suddenly became tense. The main entrances of the Municipal Council Building on Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road, which were usually wide open and freely accessible, were half-closed yesterday, leaving only one door open for entry and exit. Anyone with suspicious behavior was interrogated by members of the Volunteer Corps stationed there, to prevent unscrupulous elements from infiltrating and causing trouble. It is heard that the authorities consider this measure to be a factual necessity, but hope that all parties will not easily believe rumors and act rashly, and that the police will be cooperative.

### Anti-Japanese Uprising of Puppet Police in Western Shanghai: Zhang Zhenwu and 25 Others Seize Two Handheld Machine Guns

Zhang Zhenwu, Liu Dakui, Qian Gang, and 25 other puppet police stationed in Hejiajiao in Western Shanghai were originally police officers in the Beixinjing, Chengjiaqiao, and Caohejing police stations for many years. After the westward movement of the National Army, Zhang and others were scattered in the countryside. Later, due to livelihood issues, they temporarily joined the police bureau of the Dadao Municipal Government as puppet police in Western Shanghai, in order to take advantage of the opportunity to act. They have been empty-handed for more than ten months, and the Japanese have been monitoring them closely, leaving no opportunity to take advantage of. The other day, Zhang Zhenwu, together with Liu Dakui, Qian Gang, and 25 others, held a secret meeting, unanimously pledging allegiance to the Loyalty and National Salvation Army and vowing to serve loyally. They took a blood oath and appointed Zhang Zhenwu as their representative to contact Yao Youlian, the commander of the Second Brigade directly under the guerrilla leader, and agreed on a time and place to meet. At around 10 o'clock the night before last, Zhang Zhenwu and his group of 25 men sneaked out of Hejiajiao, seizing two handheld machine guns as a gift of entry. They were discovered by Japanese soldiers, who chased them to the vicinity of the Hongqiao International Cemetery. They were suddenly met by an ambush from both sides by troops dispatched by Brigade Commander Yao to the area. For a time, gunfire erupted and bullets rained down. The Japanese soldiers were caught off guard and retreated one after another. By the time the main force from Lincoln Road arrived, Brigade Commander Yao had already safely withdrawn.

It is also reported that when General Pléhédel left the camp, several refugee children specially used charcoal to quickly sketch the commander's portrait and present it to him, and General Pléhédel himself immediately signed a check, designating it to be given to the refugee children on Easter Sunday to improve their lives.

### Expanding Refugee Production: Forced Labor

Regardless of Gender

All Must Participate

The Shanghai International Relief Committee, in view of the indefinite end to other matters, and in order to reduce the burden on the community, is implementing forced refugee labor, so that they can support themselves in the future with a skill. Yesterday, the committee convened a meeting, chaired by Li Guiyong, and decided on the following measures: (1) In order to enable refugees who are strong and capable of participating in production work to have widespread employment, the committee has specially formulated measures for the implementation of forced refugee labor; (2) All refugees in the three subordinate camps of the committee, except those who are disabled, sick, too old, or too young, must participate in work, regardless of gender; (3) The types of work shall be determined according to the existing work in each camp and the work obtained through contact with the outside world; (4) If it is confirmed that internal or external work is not suitable for participation due to actual circumstances, and the relevant personnel have investigated and confirmed it, participation may be temporarily suspended and further assignment of work awaited; (5) If the relevant personnel believe that a certain refugee has the ability to participate in a certain type of work among the internal and external work received by each camp, and the investigation is confirmed, and the refugee refuses to do so without a legitimate reason, the following penalties shall be imposed: First warning, second warning again, third expulsion from the camp; (6) These measures will be implemented from April of the 28th year of the Republic of China, and may be amended at any time if there are any incomplete matters.

Guangci Shelter

The Guangci No. 2 Shelter at 834 Wenlin Road in this port, that is, the Guangdong Refugee No. 2 Shelter, was previously organized by the YMCA. It was not until November last year that the Cilian Association took over and hired Liu Dingzhong as the director. There are now more than 2,000 refugees in the shelter, with adult men and women accounting for more than 70%. Among them, those with jobs account for 10%. Compared with the two numbers, there are still many unemployed. It is now heard that the director of the shelter is planning to do everything possible to implement a plan to make the best use of the talents of the refugees in the shelter, so that those with skills can have jobs. However, at present, due to economic constraints, it is necessary to start with simple and easy-to-implement things first. It is planned to organize a repair workshop for broken leather shoes in the shelter in the near future, selecting skilled craftsmen to take on the repair work, and setting aside a few refugee children to work as runners, responsible for pick-up and delivery. Just dial the telephone number "41806" to the shelter, and someone will immediately pick it up, and send it back immediately after it is done. Moreover, the leather and rubber soles used in the shelter are all high-quality goods, and the prices are low and the repairs are quick, so it can be said to be good value for money, and it is intended to find a way out for the refugees. It is believed that people in the community will sympathize and be happy to patronize. The opening date has not yet been set.

Prosthetic Limb Workshop

After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, there were many wounded soldiers and refugees with amputated limbs, which was a tragic sight. The Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross established a hospital for disabled soldiers and refugees on Route Paul Henry, and specially set up a prosthetic limb workshop to produce prosthetic limbs and prosthetic hands. The treatment of wounded soldiers reached 200 people, who were still able to walk and work, with remarkable results. At the end of October last year, the Red Cross stopped direct relief work, and the hospital for wounded soldiers was closed as well. However, the prosthetic limb workshop has been moved to the refugee department of Tongren Hospital at 37 Route Tenant de la Tour, and continues to work as usual. It is now known that all the work of the workshop is proceeding smoothly. Recently, two Jewish technicians have been hired to work together. All poor and unfortunate people with amputated limbs can contact the workshop for treatment, which can be provided free of

Charge. All matters are currently presided over by Dr. Shan Huiquan, an orthopedic expert at Tongren Hospital.

Shark Fins Should be Rejected

Since the Economy and Disaster Relief Committee advocated not using shark fins for banquets, it has been widely supported by all sectors of society. The committee has now sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Citizens' Association to promote it. The letter reads, "Our committee believes that shark fins are expensive and of poor quality. At a time when we are advocating economy, why bother tasting this delicacy? The committee issued a notice urging people to stop eating them, which has been approved and implemented by all sectors of society, which is deeply gratifying. However, in order to achieve universality, we rely on promotion. Therefore, we are forwarding this letter to your association, asking you to notify all members to share the difficult times, widely persuade them, and save this extravagant item for disaster relief needs, so as not to enjoy the taste of food but worry about public safety. A small intention, please support."

### Municipal Association Sends Letter to Hengye Company to Exempt from Rent Increase

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association sent a letter to Hengye Real Estate Company yesterday, which reads, "Respectfully, according to a letter from the Twelfth District Branch of our association, member stores such as Aidu Pharmacy, Dahua Car Shop, Jiang Bingji Automotive Rubber Company, Dafeng Rongji, Yongxiangchun Tobacco Shop, Wanxingxiang, Lichang Coal Shop, Wantaiyu, Yuhang, Meifeng Boiler Iron Factory, Dabe Industrial Society, World Wireless Radio Service, Xinxing Teahouse, and Ruiyoutian have jointly stated that members have been renting houses from Hengye Real Estate Company for many years, paying rent on a monthly basis without arrears. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, members have been affected by business operations in countless ways. Recently, upon hearing of the recovery, they suddenly received a notice from Hengye Company that the rent would be increased by 16 yuan in national currency per building from May of this year. Members deeply feel that it is difficult to survive after the disaster, let alone bear this rent. Therefore, they specially ask your association to protect the citizens with all your strength, and request you to forward this matter to the landlord as soon as possible, cancel the rent increase, so as to alleviate their predicament and maintain their business. The association has received the letter with the above mentioned. According to this, it is found that in the current market, although some businesses have seen some loosening due to the sharp increase in population, most are still deeply affected by the wartime. The rent increase is really not the right time. Accordingly, we are forwarding this letter with the facts and circumstances, hoping that your company will be considerate of the difficulties of the merchants, and grant the approval to revoke the order. We look forward to hearing from you."

### "Adoptive Grandfather" Yao Keming Forced Extortion, Woman Steals Property

Stolen Property from Home Totals Over Fifty Thousand

Woman Li Zhiming Already Sent to Court for Interrogation

Yao Now Hiding in Hongkou, Under Strict Wanted Notice

Li Zhiming, a Cantonese woman currently residing at No. 54, 1060 Avenue Edward VII, lives with her widowed mother, Li Zhao, and younger brother, Li Songjiang. The woman is already in her thirties and still unmarried. Because her mother is old and her brother is young, she manages the household affairs and most of the property. Her brother, Songjiang, was adopted according to Shanghai customs by Yao Keming when he was young. Yao used his status as an adoptive grandfather to enter and leave the Li family and even manage household affairs, which brought him closer to Zhiming. Recently, Li Songjiang discovered that tens of thousands of gold in stocks, passbooks, jewelry, and other valuables in his home had been gradually taken by his sister, Li Zhiming, and Yao Keming, either through sales or fraudulent withdrawals. He immediately reported this to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest and detain Li Zhiming to investigate the type and exact amount of stolen property, and to secretly apprehend Yao Keming for punishment. After a week of investigation by the Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the city case, it was learned that Yao Keming is now hiding in Hongkou, a special area that is currently difficult to access, so Yao is still temporarily at large. As for the property that Li stole and gave to Yao, the following items have been confirmed: (1) Valuable jewelry worth 9,300 yuan, (2) Shanghai Bank deposit, based on evidence, Yao withdrew all deposits and interest totaling 28,200 yuan in July of the 25th year, (3) Public Bus Company stock, Yao entrusted a foreign merchant at 267 Jiangxi Road to resell to Zhu and two others in January of the 24th year, for a price of 9,100 yuan, (4) A fire insurance policy for the Jiangwan house insured with Tianyi Insurance Company. When the house was burned down, the compensation of over 8,700 yuan was completely withdrawn by Yao in August of last year. The above four items total 55,372.42 yuan. In addition, the passbook with over 28,000 yuan deposited in the World Book Company is also in Yao's possession. It is presumed that the deposit period has not yet expired, so it has not been withdrawn, but the monthly interest is also taken by Yao and Li in turns. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Li Zhiming to the First Special District Court, where Judge Meng interrogated her. Police Attorney Qian Jiu first stated the case of prosecuting Li Zhiming for embezzlement and then gave a detailed account of the police's investigation. Finally, he requested a postponement of the case because it was still necessary to investigate and retrieve the stolen goods, and requested a wanted notice for Yao, stating that Yao was hiding in Hongkou and it might be difficult to apprehend him temporarily. During the court's questioning of Li Zhiming, she admitted to stealing various properties and giving them to Yao and claimed that Yao would resort to violence if she did not comply, but she denied having any other relationship with Yao. Judge Meng then approved the police's request, remanded the defendant in custody, and rescheduled the hearing.

### Cotton Sold to British-owned Textile Mills Is Detained

Gate North Fake Police

Extortion Fails

Express News Agency, local dispatch: The transportation merchant Ji Shi Ji recently loaded a large batch of cotton near Ningbo, totaling 1,737 bales, each worth over 400 yuan, amounting to over 700,000 yuan. They were transported to Shanghai by Fusheng, Deping, Ende, Kelan, and others and sold to British-owned textile mills such as Tongyi and Chongxin in this city. They used civilian boats to transport and load the goods, with three boats from Hesheng and two boats from Zhida delivering them to the factories. Unexpectedly, the five boats of cotton, when passing through the Xinzha Bridge section of the Suzhou River, were detained by the fake organization "Police Branch of Gate North" after their extortion attempt failed. Despite repeated negotiations by the boatmen, the boats were not released. Moreover, the cotton on the cargo ships was arbitrarily moved by workers to empty rooms in the former Four Banks Warehouse on the north bank of the Suzhou River, in an attempt to embezzle the goods. The British merchants are greatly angered and have requested the British consulate to protest to the Japanese side, demanding the return of the cotton. Meanwhile, the persons in charge of the textile mills have repeatedly negotiated, but no results have been achieved so far.

### Killed Due to Adultery

"News Vendor Leader Killed

Five Murderers Have Been Sent to Court

Instigator 'Little Hubei' Is on the Run"

News vendor Wu Guisheng and a fellow vendor nicknamed "Little Hubei" had a feud due to business competition. Recently, a woman whom Little Hubei was in love with suddenly became intimate with Wu, which deepened the enmity to the point of irreconcilability. Wu originally lived in Room 36, Runhua Hotel, Lane 604, Fuzhou Road. On the evening of the 21st of the month, when Wu left the hotel, several thugs who were lying in wait in the lane surrounded Wu and used sharp blades to slash at Wu's buttocks, causing serious injuries. These people, seeing their objective achieved, dispersed in a rush. Wu did not report to the police station but went directly to the Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital notified the Lao Zha Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Xue Youwen and Detective Chen Ruisheng to investigate. However, Wu refused to reveal the full truth. It was not until yesterday that Detectives Xue and Chen learned that the assailants were hiding at No. 22, Lane 357, Tianjin Road. They arrested Xu Asi (also known as Xiao Asi), Li Damao, Liu Bingqing (also known as Xiao Sichuan), Wang Xiaomao (nicknamed Cigarette Butt), and Yan Bingfu, but Little Hubei was on the run. Wu Guisheng died of his injuries at 11:00 p.m. last night. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Ru Baoyi briefly described the incident, stating that Wu Guisheng's body needed to be examined by the court's inspection department, and therefore requested permission to detain them. After questioning by Judge Zhong Qing, he ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.

### Embezzled Funds All Sent to Shanghai West Gambling Dens

Chen Zhongwen, Wen Ziyao, and Gu Jinxian from Pudong each invested 2,000 gold in November of last year to operate a rice business. Chen and Wen were specifically assigned to collect rice in Qingpu, while Gu was responsible for sales in Shanghai. All the accounts were collected by Gu and then transferred to Chen and Wen for purchasing rice. To date, the business has reached over 20,000 yuan. However, recently Gu suddenly disappeared. After investigation by Chen and others, they learned that Gu had collected 4,100 yuan from Yang Jiuji at No. 145 Zhejiang Road and 1,500 yuan from Zhuang Zhilin at No. 9 Yude Lane, Guangxi Road, but did not hand them over, embezzling them for his own use. They then investigated Gu's whereabouts and finally arrested him in the French Concession on Shan Zhong Road yesterday and brought him to the French Police Station. As the crime occurred within the jurisdiction of the Lao Zha Police Station, he was transferred to the Lao Zha Police Station for handling. After questioning by Chinese Detective Xue Youwen, Gu confessed that the collected funds had all been lost in the Rongsheng Company gambling dens in western Shanghai. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Ru Baoyi stated that it was still necessary to investigate the whereabouts of the embezzled funds and therefore requested permission to postpone the hearing. After questioning Gu, Judge Zhong Qing ordered the hearing to be rescheduled.

### Guerrilla Squad Executes Drug Trafficker

Chen Shanqing, a rascal from Caohejing, stayed in the town after the National Army moved west, stealing for a living. Later, he served as a cook for the Japanese troops. Recently, he has been selling drugs, specializing in sales in the villages of western Shanghai, making a huge profit. At around 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, Chen left home intending to go to Xinzhuang Town. When he reached the vicinity of Huacun Temple, he was suddenly stopped by a sentry from the guerrilla squad. Chen panicked and fled, and the sentry opened fire, hitting him in the head and killing him on the spot. It is said that the deceased was 45 years old and had a wife and concubine.

### The Handgun Used to Murder Chen Tingsheng Was Involved in Sixteen Bloodshed Cases, and Eight Other Attempted Murders

Chen Tingsheng, a native of Zhenjiang residing at No. 39 Haige Lane, Haige Road, was assassinated by his mistress Wang Guizhen and her lover Tao Boqing (also known as Pockmarked Boqing) in collusion with four others. The French police station solved the case the following day. The two shameless men and women, Wang and Tao, confessed to the joint conspiracy in court and stated that the four fugitives, Xing Ali, Jin Yufa, Wang Liansheng, and Cao Jinfa, had carried out the act. It is now known that after Chen was killed, the police station seized the bullet casings used to kill Chen. After studying them, the police have now found out that the handgun used for the bullet casings has been used by bandits in the city on multiple occasions. The gun has been used 24 times in total, resulting in 16 fatalities and bloodshed cases, as well as eight attempted assassinations. Therefore, the police station is now stepping up its investigation.

### Pan Sansheng Gained Ill-Gotten Wealth, Suddenly Visited by Robbers, Three Criminals Arrested and Scheduled for Sentencing

Wang Jie (also known as the female owner of Wang Ji Photo Studio), a woman from Wuxi, is now 30 years old. She is skilled in Kunqu and Peking opera. She once married a certain Tongli, so news of Mrs. Qin's frequent appearances on stage was often seen in the newspapers. Wang requested to leave and then married Pan Sansheng. Pan is the owner of the Yangtze River "Inland River Shipping Company" and the "Asia Club" (casino). He built a huge mansion at No. 10, Lane 126, Kaina Road in western Shanghai. As the various businesses he operates are well-suited for this extraordinary period, he has profited handsomely, making him coveted by petty criminals. It is recently learned that Pan also took the opportunity to ingratiate himself with a certain party, released a certain guerrilla leader, and received a reward of 200,000 yuan. Thus, on January 27th of this year at 10:15 a.m., several robbers armed with weapons, holding cakes and oranges, used the excuse of delivering gifts to swindle open the door of Pan's house and rushed in. At that time, Pan and his wife Wang Jie were sound asleep in bed. Suddenly awakened from their dreams, they were threatened with guns and forbidden to make any noise. The robbers obtained the keys, opened both large and small iron boxes, and robbed them of 22,850 yuan in cash, 700 Japanese yen, as well as valuable jewelry such as gold and silver ornaments and jewelry, before leaving after about an hour. Later, the Chinese detectives Pi Bingzhang and Wu Changli of the Xinzha Police Station arrested the robbers Li Yutang (also known as Lin Gen), Zhang Yixian, and Tang Abao, all from Dachang, as well as seizing three Mauser pistols, one handgun, 39 rounds of ammunition, a Yong'an Company deposit book with 200 yuan, and jewelry and Qian Duo. They were taken to the police station and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. It is now learned that the detectives handling the case found that Li and the other three criminals were also involved in the robbery of the finances of Tiao Qing's family at No. 10, Lane 51, Xin Tangjia Lane on the evening of the 27th of last month, amounting to 1,500 yuan. Yesterday morning, Li, Zhang, and Tang were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Li Zhishan stood up and detailed the above situation, stating that in addition to the two robbery cases in the concession, the defendants also committed two robbery cases in the French Concession. Although the French police station has sent personnel to retrieve them, they have not yet provided official documents, and this case has not yet been concluded, so they should be ordered to be transferred to the next case. The court approved the request. Then, the victims Pan Wang (i.e., Wang Jie) and Lu Tiaoqing came to the court to testify about the robbery. Wang specifically pointed out that Li and Tang were present at the scene at the time. When questioned, the defendants all admitted that they had only robbed Pan's family of 5,000 yuan in cash, one gold ring, and two watches. They divided the loot into eight shares, each share worth 700 yuan. Tang Abao received three shares because he had two handguns. Li Yutang and the fugitives Wang Gengsheng, Ma Shunsheng, Gu Agen, and Wang's informant each received one share. The stolen money from Lu's family was divided into eleven shares, each share worth 140 yuan. Judge Xiao verified the confessions, announced the conclusion of the debate on the case, and scheduled the sentencing for next Friday. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### The Chinese Army Special Operations Team Again Warns Gambling Dens

Delivered Personally by Members of the Special Operations Team

Gamblers Trembled with Fear

It is known that the opium dens and gambling dens in the extraterritorial area of ​​western Shanghai have been repeatedly warned by the Chinese Army Special Operations Team in the past, ordering them to automatically close down by a certain date, otherwise they will be severely punished. However, these people were so frantic and contemptuous of the law that they remained the same as before. After the Chinese Army Special Operations Team learned of this situation, they felt extremely pained. On the day before yesterday (the 22nd), they issued a final warning to each den and paid more attention to several dens with the most prevalent gambling, such as Hollywood. It is known that the final warning was personally delivered by members of the Special Operations Team. The gambling dens were panicked after receiving it, especially Hollywood. According to eyewitnesses, after Hollywood received the warning at around 4:00 p.m. that afternoon, they thought that a large army would attack immediately, so they were terrified and immediately frantically knocked on the secret alarm they had set up. All the rascals and coolies in the den were immediately armed with weapons and ambushed at each entrance and exit, and ordered all the male and female gamblers not to act arbitrarily. All the gambling tables were stopped immediately. At that time, the general gamblers wanted to escape but could not, and asked to leave but could not. They were all trembling with fear. More than ten minutes later, seeing that there was no urgent movement after the Special Operations Team members delivered the warning, they resumed gambling as before. However, the general gamblers have already been terrified and scattered. In recent days, they are even more afraid of the decisive action of the Special Operations Team, so gamblers have stopped moving forward. The period of suppression is not far away.

### Huge Fire at Huangpu Wharf, Carelessness at the Japanese Mail Steamship Company Warehouse, Still Burning Fiercely This Morning

The Huangpu Wharf on Huangpu Road north of the Suzhou River at the Outer Baidu Bridge, commonly known as the Japanese Mail Steamship Company Wharf, is located opposite the Japanese Consulate. At around 11:00 p.m. last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the warehouse next to the wharf. For a time, the flames were soaring, and the red light filled the sky. Even from a distance of several miles, it could be seen. The intensity of the fire can be imagined. However, because the area is a Japanese gathering area and a guarded area, it is impossible to investigate the cause. After receiving the alarm, the Central Fire Brigade of the Public Concession dispatched four fire trucks to put out the fire, but it was difficult to extinguish the fire. It is said that the goods in the warehouse were all combustible materials, so it was difficult to put out the fire. Until about 1:30 a.m., the fire subsided slightly, but soon it flared up again. At the time the reporter sent the manuscript, it was still burning fiercely. Other details will be reported later.

### Arrested for Carrying Opium

Zhu Baolin from Shichang was carrying 15 taels of opium at 10:10 a.m. the day before yesterday and took a Route 2 public bus from Caojiadu to Beller Road in the French Concession. The bus passed the intersection of Haig Road and Foch Road when he was suddenly searched by Chinese constables No. 2524 and others who boarded the bus. Zhu was arrested and the opium was confiscated and taken to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the First Court. After questioning by Judge Liu, he was ordered to be remanded in custody and sentenced on the 30th.

### Situation After the Establishment of the Refugee Cooperative

Two Thousand Yuan of Cooperative Shares Have Been Recognized

The Current Focus of the Cooperative Affairs Is on Design

The Shanghai Refugee Production and Consumption Limited Huangren Cooperative reported that since the company held its first board meeting on March 1st and announced its establishment, two weeks have passed in an instant. According to the original planned outline, business operations should have started immediately. However, the total amount of cooperative shares tentatively set by the company is 10,000 yuan, with 5,000 yuan used for production business and 5,000 yuan used for consumption business. Currently, about 2,000 yuan of cooperative shares have been recognized, and 8,000 yuan are still to be recognized. If it is an ordinary company, it cannot hold an inaugural meeting in accordance with the law until the shares are fully subscribed. However, the cooperative does not have this restriction. As long as there are more than seven people, it can be established. The founders can convene an inaugural meeting, pass the articles of association, elect directors and supervisors, and organize the board of directors for the registration of establishment. Therefore, to facilitate the process, the company was established as scheduled according to the original plan without waiting for the cooperative shares to be fully subscribed. On the one hand, the company still invites all parties to join, and on the other hand, it starts business operations. However, with only 2,000 yuan of recognized cooperative shares, it can only start with a small scale. In the future, as cooperative shares continue to be recognized, business will gradually be promoted. Once some achievements are made, large-scale expansion can still be carried out. The government strongly promotes cooperative undertakings. In October of last year, the Organization of the China Cooperative Association was initiated by the Westerner Ellie and subsidized by the Executive Yuan. The company can also request the government to provide hierarchical funds. However, it must first request the assistance of various Shanghai charities. Currently, the Zhen, Danjin, Liyang, and Five Counties Association of Natives in Shanghai have recognized 1,000 yuan of cooperative shares. Although the others have expressed their approval, they have not joined the company due to financial difficulties or other reasons. The company plans to ask them to quickly recognize the shares to facilitate the process. As for the company's address, it is currently temporarily borrowed from the office of the Zhen, Danjin, Liyang, and Five Counties Relief Association as a temporary location. It can only find another address after more cooperative shares have been recognized. As for the internal organization, the board of directors has held a meeting once and elected executive directors and chairman, while the board of supervisors has not yet held a meeting, so the chairman of the board of supervisors has not yet been elected. It is planned to ask the supervisors present to hold a meeting today. The executive directors have held two meetings and appointed several cadres, all of whom are temporarily unpaid, but they cannot be allowed to work for the company hungry, so food is also provided. Once the company's business is more developed, it will be designed. It is planned to invite people from all walks of life to be design committee members for the company in order to gather ideas and benefit. This is the general situation of the company after its establishment.

### Elementary School Teacher Xie Xiangsheng's Two Cases Combined: Seducing Women and Embezzling Deposits, One Already Tried and One on Appeal

Xie Xiangsheng, a native of Changzhou, is 39 years old this year. He was previously a class teacher in the Lagena Elementary School established by the French Municipal Council on Lagena Road in the French Concession. In early April of the 26th year, he advertised for female teaching assistants. At that time, Wang Wu, the mother of Wang Jie from Liuhe, who was 20 years old at the time and only 18 years and 4 months in actual age, was beautiful and had graduated from a high school in the countryside. She wanted to pursue further education but was unable to transfer schools due to her family's financial situation. She came to Shanghai and lived with her aunt at No. 9 Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road, wanting to find a part-time job to pursue further education. She saw the advertisement for female teaching assistants in the newspaper and immediately sent a letter of application. The next day, Wang Jie received a letter signed by Ding Jieshen, asking Wang to go to No. 14, Jiyi Lane, Pobei Road, to meet with Xie to discuss the matter. She was approved for employment, and it was agreed that the monthly salary would be 15 yuan. Wang was ordered to work at Xie's residence at No. 14, Jiyi Lane, specializing in reviewing elementary school students' papers. Wang went on April 26th and officially took office. Xie and Wang gradually became familiar with each other. At 4:00 p.m. on May 16th, Xie returned to his residence from school and raped Wang Jie using violent means. Later, Xie claimed that his parents had left and promised to formally marry her, etc., to deceive her. The woman lived at Xie's place and continued to have sex more than ten times. After about three or four months, the woman fell ill due to physical abuse. Xie unexpectedly turned into a hideous face and issued an order to evict her, driving the woman out. Wang was unaware, so she was deceived and lost her virginity and had no power to negotiate with Xie. Therefore, Wang Wu, the woman's mother, as the legal representative, hired attorney Qian Yuan to file a private prosecution for obstructing public morals and family in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against Xie Xiangsheng, and attached a civil suit, requesting to recover compensation for mental distress, living expenses, etc., totaling 8,000 yuan. The defendant, Xie Xiangsheng, also filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The initial trial resulted in a judgment that Xie Xiangsheng and Wang Wu were both innocent, Wang Jie's private prosecution was not accepted, and the attached civil suit was rejected. The plaintiffs, Wang Wu and Wang Jie, mother and daughter, were dissatisfied and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court.

Due to the fact that the defendant, Xie Xiangsheng, was relevant after the incident occurred, and concerned the reputation of the school, the school fired him, causing his address to change and making it impossible to deliver the summons, resulting in the appeal being suspended. The case was shelved. Then, after the outbreak of the war two years ago, Xie Xiangsheng took advantage of the extraordinary period and set up an employment agency on the Youth Association Building at No. 132 Yuanmingyuan Road in the Public Concession last year. The inside story was mainly to introduce marriages, and he turned to defrauding the employees and registered person's deposits for his own use. The Public Police Station learned about it and sent detectives to search and report it, and arrested Xie and sent him to the First Special Court.

The result of the trial was that Xie was found not guilty and released due to insufficient evidence of the crime. Xie did not change his ways and continued as before. Later, the victims collected evidence and reported to the First Special Court. After trial by Judge Feng Shide, Xie Xiangsheng was convicted of embezzlement in business and sentenced to one year in prison and remanded in custody for appeal. Xie was not satisfied with the judgment and decided to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. During the investigation period, the case was scheduled for retrial on the 3rd of next month. Now, because the Third Branch of the High Court has learned about the previous case, it prepared a document and dispatched personnel to the Second Branch of the High Court to transfer Xie to the court.

The trial was scheduled to be held at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. However, the appellant Wang Jie has joined the Political Department of the Eighth Route Army after the outbreak of the war, and her mother, Wang Wu, has also returned to her hometown, making it impossible to contact them. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, Court President Wu Tingqi and Judges Wang Yue and Chen Daqi opened a collegial panel for the trial. Attorney Qian Yuan, the agent of the appellant, arrived on behalf of the appellant, stated the reasons for the appeal, and then questioned Xie Xiangsheng, who talked eloquently and admitted that he had a relationship with Ms. Wang, but that it was a consensual matter and there was no use of violence, coercion, or seduction. Later, the woman asked me for 300 yuan, but I was unable to pay it, which led to litigation, etc. After verifying the confession in court, it was announced that the debate was over, and the sentencing was scheduled for the 31st. Xie was still remanded in custody.

### Spring Snow This Morning

The local weather suddenly turned severely cold from midnight the day before yesterday, with fierce north winds howling like mid-winter. Until 9:00 p.m. yesterday, there was light rain, the wind subsided slightly, and the climate seemed to be turning better from hardship. Unexpectedly, at about 1:40 a.m. this morning, spring snow fell, with large snowflakes falling densely. In an instant, the roof tiles were all white, which will have a great impact on agricultural production.

### Summer Uniforms of Chinese Constables in the Public Concession Change Color

The summer uniforms of the Chinese constables in the Public Concession have always been dark blue. This year, new tea-brown uniforms will be worn. The upper body of the uniform has a high collar and black buttons, with two pockets on the chest. The trousers are short, and the hat is still the same as before. The blue cloth leggings will also not be changed. It is said that the new uniform is more comfortable than the old one, and the material is quite good, enough to resist the heat. As for the uniforms of the Western constables and Indian constables, they will remain the same as before and will not be changed.

### Hollywood Gambling Den: Tea Boy Convicted of Drug Trafficking
Ma Zhongliang, a tea boy from the Hollywood gambling den on Yuyuan Road, was found with a package of opium the other day. He was apprehended by the French police en route and taken to the Second Special Court's criminal division. He was sentenced to a fine of eighty yuan as a warning.

Physicians Registered with the Public Works Department

The register of physicians, dentists, and veterinarians for this year, compiled by the Public Works Department, has now been published. The contents are divided into five sections: (1) 1,225 practicing physicians, (2) 330 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, (3) 3 Indian doctors, (4) 201 dentists, and (5) 22 veterinarians. In addition, it includes a list of doctors who have left Shanghai. All of the above physicians have been approved to practice by the Shanghai Medical Committee. The above register can be purchased at the Public Works Department's General Office, Room 210, 223 Hankou Road, for one yuan per copy.

Neighboring Woman Injured by Falling Skylight

Ms. Jin (30 years old), a native of Haining, resides at No. 6 Yinyu Lane, Baxianqiao, in the French Concession. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, a sudden gust of wind blew the glass skylight covering her courtyard into the courtyard of No. 7 next door. At the time, a woman was doing laundry in the courtyard and was unable to escape, resulting in a severe head injury. She was later taken to the hospital by her family for treatment, and her condition is critical.

Gambling Dens to Merge Operations

Gambling dens in western Shanghai are currently merging large and small operations. The Japanese organizers have scheduled a complete shutdown on the 15th of this month. However, after a maximum of one week, they will re-register and reopen. In the future, approximately seven to ten establishments, including Hollywood, Rongsheng, Dasheng, Guangsheng, and Daxin, will monopolize the market. A particularly large Hollywood-affiliated gambling den, owned by someone surnamed Rong, will emerge on Yuyuan Road.

French Concession Japanese Soldiers Arrest Two Tea Drinkers

Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, a squad of Japanese soldiers stationed at the Zhengshi Middle School in the French Concession's Xizhen area conducted a surprise patrol. They arrested two tea drinkers at a small teahouse in Xishi and escorted them to the squad headquarters. It is reported that the two arrested men are both around thirty years old. One was wearing a black wool overcoat and blue cloth trousers. They appeared to be from out of town.

In the other match, the Reserve League match between Donghua and St. Francis will be held at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park. Since Donghua lost to Westport last week, the championship has become questionable. This is Donghua's last match. If they win, they will win the championship. If they draw, they will tie with Westport and West Foss with 13 points each, forming a three-way tie. The winner will be determined by the number of goals scored. If they lose, their hopes for the championship will be dashed. Therefore, the stakes are high. It is hoped that the Donghua players will give their all and not let the championship, which is within reach, fall into the hands of others. The Reserve League was established in 1936. The first champion was Donghua. Only one match remains in the league, St. Francis vs. Aurora, which is irrelevant to the overall situation.

Western Youth Volleyball Group A Match

Haiqing Defeats Paramount by a Large Margin

Industrial Girls' Middle School Defeats Green, White, and Red in the Women's Group

Meilu Team Defeats Iron Team by a Large Margin in Group B

Last night's Western Youth Volleyball, the Industrial Girls' Middle School vs. Green, White, and Red in the women's group, took the stage first. Green, White, and Red showed their power from the start, leading 11 to 5. Industrial Girls' Middle School quickly caught up and surpassed them, winning the first game 15 to 13. It was a pity that Green, White, and Red lost by two points. In the second game, Green, White, and Red showed signs of fatigue, and Industrial Girls' Middle School took the opportunity to attack, with Huang Mingyuan and Pan Baojian showing their skills, winning again 15 to 4. In the Group B match between Meilu and the Iron Team, the Iron Team's skills were immature, and Meilu easily defeated them 15 to 9 and 15 to 4. In the final Group A match between Haiqing and Paramount, both sides had famous players, and everyone expected a fierce battle. However, the situation turned out to be one-sided, and the entire match only took 18 minutes to end. After the start, Haiqing's Zhang Renming served and scored three points. Zheng Yiquan's spikes were fierce, while Paramount's Tan Yongzhan frequently made mistakes. When Haiqing led 12 to 0, Paramount finally scored a point, but Haiqing quickly won the game 15 to 4. In the second game, Paramount scored the first point, but Haiqing's Mai Bingyao and Han Dewei each showed their skills, scoring nine points in one go. Haiqing ultimately won again 15 to 2. The absence of Paramount's players Zhou Dayun and Huang Jiajun was likely one of the reasons for the crushing defeat. However, Haiqing's strength was indeed strong, and their victory was not a fluke. There are a total of nine matches today, including four in Group B and five in the women's group, starting at 1:15 PM.

The So-called "Joint Declaration" in Free Talk by Mao Lie

Since Germany annihilated Czechoslovakia and made demands on Romania, the British government's attitude seems to have changed a great deal, actually taking an attitude of non-recognition. Although this non-recognition cannot have any impact on Hitler, it cannot be said to be an uninspired move. Subsequently, the British government urgently proposed the matter of a "joint declaration" to the Soviet Union and France. This, of course, is another uninspired move, because it is better than inaction and complete inertia. However, how effective will this "joint declaration" actually be if the various countries sign it into being and announce it? How many international treaties have already been torn up by the strong, and these treaties were all personally signed by the strong? What consideration do the violent ones have now when they see a one-sided declaration? The annexation of Mi America, during the gestation period of this declaration, can also give us food for thought.

Therefore, these so-called "joint declarations," since the violent ones do not join, have already become "one-sided declarations," and the failure of Poland and the Netherlands to join further creates fissures on top of this "one-sidedness." If this declaration does eventually come into being, then of course it will become a "piecemeal declaration." A true joint declaration is an international treaty; when that's ineffective, one seeks recourse in a one-sided declaration, which is the euphemistically named joint declaration; when a one-sided declaration cannot be successfully established, one seeks recourse in a piecemeal declaration, which is the declaration currently being pursued by the British government: things get worse and worse, like one crab being worse than another. How can I not believe that the violent ones will ridicule and jeer at this!

I am not a violent one, so of course I have no intention of ridiculing or jeering at this kind of declaration, whether it is piecemeal, one-sided, or joint. I say this merely to point out these two things: against violent ones, any document is useless, and this "joint declaration," which is actually a "piecemeal declaration," is even more useless; against violent ones, one must use actual actions to give them a serious blow! Otherwise, I cannot help but suspect that the British government is still merely appeasing the weak and small who have been invaded: before the violent ones invade Britain itself, the British government will never take more proactive actual actions.

So-called actual actions do not necessarily involve mobilizing troops—if that were the case, of course, it would be best—but there are other things that can be done, such as forming a defensive line, etc. Doing so can still curb the ferocity of the aggressor. However, the British government either does not see this or sees it but is unwilling to do so, wanting to settle things with declarations alone. In that case, hoping for world peace is truly like trying to find fish in a tree!

Night Music of Early Spring by LK

Pushing open the door of the heart, twenty years of cold and heat have passed on the strings of life.

Yearning and attachment hang on America, the mood is like a summer night's firefly, flashing on the riverbank, the bridge, flashing through the woods, and flashing through the quiet fields.

It is a night serenade of the wilderness creatures, a surge and fall.

"Can't remember flying away?" The question from the bottom of the heart, plays the firefly's flickering.

One year, two years, three years... it is the vitality of youth, pushing towards the journey of life.

Not understanding charm, not understanding deception. The heart is as clean as white paper, letting the dawn wind rise like a swallow soaring, like an eagle flying far. Even if that is gilded scrap metal, one must try; even if that is a cruel devil, one must try; even if that is a poisonous curtain! of paradise! one must try.

It is the resonance of trying that attracts the comrades' calls. The calls are like the mosquitoes' buzzing in summer, gradually, gradually rising, a burst of thunder and lightning.

It is cursing the ugliness, and praising the beauty; it is pushing the dormancy, and restraining the recklessness; it is exposing the deception, and untying the poison; it is rebelling against the exploitation, and fighting even when blood is drawn.

The dormant stand up, the docile become stubborn, the hearts of slaves flow eastward with the water. Sympathy gathers the spirits together.

"Can't remember wanting to rush?"

The heart's music of the crowd, plays the spring thunder's torrent.

One year, two years, three years... it is the vitality of youth, pushing towards the journey of life.

Climbing steep mountains, wading through wilderness, for twenty years, the strings of life play a nostalgic lament, but there is still warmth, blood, ardent love, and also pursuit.

The blood of wounds, the blood of suffering, a drop, a heap; the sun warms them, the dawn wind blows them, the giant wheel runs over them, the blood nourishes the earth!

However, this is the cobblestone paving the way for the age of the masses. The younger generation strides forward.

Twenty years, crawling like a snail.

Twenty years, flying like an ocean.

The night serenade arouses resonance, the trying arouses struggle, my heart should have carefree laughter, leaping and congratulating myself.

Fireflies, flicker! brightly. Spring thunder, roar! powerfully.

The hearts of the masses guide me; my heart is attached to the masses. Even if there are still thorns, poison pills ahead, and that aimless trembling in the endless dark night.

"Don't want to fly away?" The question from the bottom of the heart, hides behind the door.

Twenty years, a long time; twenty years, a short process.

Here there is still blood, warmth, ardent love, and also pursuit.

"Just bring a heart of struggle! There is a god of war, but there is also a god of love!"

Midnight, the door of the heart closes, the strings of life play a cheerful marching tune.

Pillow by He Ming

Embroidered on the pillow is a map of China, and in the northeast corner is added a red question mark. This was embroidered and given to me by her two years ago.

It accompanies me to sleep every night, from darkness to light.

The red "question mark," I see it every day, it sternly warns me: China already has rapacious jackals, it alerts me: do not live a life of drunken stupor! It urges me even more: to do what I must do, and what I should do!

A bloody smell pierces my nose from the red lines, and goes straight to the depths of my heart.

Lying here are countless rotted dead, filled with a stream of fresh red

A Discussion on the Art World: The "Sitting in the Palace" Introduction and the Opening Poem by Zhang Guyu

"Sitting in the Palace" is the premier scene in "Visiting Mother." The Kui School's "Visiting Mother" emphasizes the bond between mother and son, brothers, siblings, and the "crying in the hall" scene depicting the tragic parting of husband and wife. The removal of the lengthy "crying in the hall" speech and the emphasis on "Sitting in the Palace" began with Yu Sansheng. This was because Yu was aware that his voice had ample tenderness but lacked tragic grandeur. To perform the entire play from beginning to end (without the return to the palace) was first pioneered by Tan Xinpei. Although Tan's voice was not as good as the various members of the Kui School at the time, the credit for his face, body, water sleeves, and 'diao mao' (饰毛, decorative feathers) were beyond the reach of those like Long Changsheng and his ilk. As the Tan School became more widespread and the Kui School lacked successors, those who study "Visiting Mother" today all regard the Tan School as the standard.

The Difference Between the Kui and Yu School Introductions

The Kui School's "Visiting Mother" introduction is: "Imprisoned in Youzhou, I think of my old mother, constantly on my mind." The Yu School's is: "The golden well locks the phoenix tree, a long sigh idly follows a gust of wind." In fact, the Kui School is better than the Yu School. The introduction is the theme of the play, like the synopsis of the script. The Yu School's "The golden well locks the phoenix tree, a long sigh idly follows a gust of wind" is neither as understandable as the Kui School's nor is its literary meaning easily decipherable. According to the famous actor Furong Cao, the "golden well" is the name of a bird, native to the north. If that's the case, then the introduction is clear. (As for Zheng Dage, Guo Yi, Su Shaoqing, Jun Fan Songhuang and others' interpretations of this introduction, they all have the flaw of forcing reason.) However, it is never as smooth and accessible as "Imprisoned in Youzhou, I think of my old mother, constantly on my mind," and the tone and cadence are also more robust. Some famous predecessors in the Ping Opera world have surprisingly said that this introduction was adopted by Tan Xinpei from Han Opera, which is laughable. I have repeatedly watched the famous Han Opera actors Wu Sanbao and Chen Erhong (i.e., Twelve Red) perform "Sitting in the Palace" (both Wu and Chen claimed it as their specialty), and Yang Yanhui always enters with a "dao ban" (倒板, a type of aria) of "self-reflection and lamentation in the palace." The appearance is the same as in Ping Opera, only he holds a folding fan. I never saw an introduction or an opening poem. When asked of the veteran actor Yu Hongyuan, he also said he had never heard of it. These people are so boastful that it is difficult for them to be masters.

Tan's Revision of the Opening Poem

The opening poem is recited: "Meeting at the beach stirred the *xiu*, lost in the foreign land for fifteen autumns; unable to kowtow before my mother in the hall, how can one not shed tears?" Some recite: "Meeting at the beach for fifteen years, geese fly past Hengyang on separate days; it's hard to see my mother in the hall, how can one not be tearful." The former is the old poem, the latter is Tan's poem. The reason Tan revised the old poem is that the lyrics of the princess, the empress dowager, and Guan's general were mostly in the *yan qian zhe* rhyme. Therefore, Yang Silang's opening poem was also changed to *yan qian*; however, some Tan School *laosheng* (老生, old male roles) still recite the old poem.

Time Ji Contradicts a Guest's Question

A guest asked me, "The princess's aria is clearly about spring (peonies and medicine flowers bloom in red, a bright and sunny day with birds chirping), but Yang Yanhui's opening poem has the line 'geese fly past Hengyang on separate days.' Are these not contradictory?" I asked in return, "How are they contradictory?" The guest said, "Swallows come in spring, geese know autumn, and geese pass Hengyang in autumn, isn't it?" I said, "You are mistaken. Youzhou is located in the north, and the Song Dynasty occupies the south. Therefore, the three words 'on separate days' are added after 'geese fly past Hengyang'. Geese fly south in autumn and return north in spring. Isn't it spring when geese fly past Hengyang to the north! Where does the contradiction come from?" The guest replied, "According to your words, then Silang's visit to his mother is in spring." I laughed and said, "Didn't you see Silang sing, 'Xiao Tianzuo arranges the Tianmen, the two countries will battle. My old mother brings food supplies to the northern barbarians'? The barbarian country is arranging their formation, and the Song camp is transporting grain, indicating that both sides are still preparing for war. Ancient wars had to wait until after the autumn harvest, so Silang's visit to his mother must be in the spring."

The New Invention of Film Star Makeup (Shao Zhuo)

American movie actors now commonly use a material with shaping effects called "No. 6". This makeup material was invented by makeup artist Tom Steele. Its advantages are threefold: (1) Regardless of the appearance, it can be transformed as desired immediately, and the procedure is simple, far surpassing the previous makeup techniques. (2) This makeup material is applied to the face to form a thin mask, but various facial expressions, such as smiling, laughing, yawning, frowning, etc., can still be expressed as usual, without any deviation. (3) This makeup material is loose in texture and can absorb sweat. It does not damage the skin when applied or removed.

Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in the movie "Marie Antoinette" were made up by Tom Steele using "No. 6", lifelike and ingenious. If you compare it with Louis XVI's rubber sheet, you will not believe that it is a Hollywood actor, but suspect that it is the reincarnation of the French Emperor at the end of the eighteenth century.

The Jingwu Athletic Association: Drama and Music Activities (Dai Zi)

After "August 13th," the Jingwu Athletic Association moved its headquarters from the fires of war to the third floor of the Mainland Commercial Building. In addition to focusing on the training of martial arts and skills, the association also has various other activities, with a wide range and many categories. This article only reports on drama and music activities.

Spoken Drama

The Jingwu Athletic Association's drama group was recently established and held its inaugural meeting on December 20 last year. The main members who joined the group are Zhu Lianxiang, Zhou Fuxing, Tao Tianwen, Chen Yunzhang, Tu Changyao, Weng Changning, Luo Jianhua, Shao Yuanzhao, Lu Hong, Shen Jinkang, Ou Renliang, Tu Hengyao, Xu Shaoxia, Tong Peiqing, Shi Pinhai, You Jingjuan, Fan Dianxia, ​​Tian Yurong, Hu Junmin, Shen Xisan, Xia Wuxin, Lin Xianian, Yu Fo, etc. Zhu Xiang also serves as the director, and Wu Renzhi, Hua Sha, and Xu Yi serve as instructors. They practice three times a week, from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Tian Yurong is responsible for teaching and reading scripts to ensure correct pronunciation. They are currently rehearsing the two-act play "Dumb Wife" and "A Father Returns". After the rehearsals are pure and proficient, they will be trial performances.

Peking Opera

Peking Opera is also an activity under the Jingwu Athletic Association's music department. All members of the association can join, with a monthly fee of two yuan and twenty yuan per year. The General Assembly annually elects committee members to serve as drama affairs, accounting, and document affairs. Except for Sundays, the practice time is from 8:00 pm to 10:00 pm every day. A full-dress rehearsal is held once a year. Before the full-dress rehearsal, the practice time will be longer than usual. Now Mr. Qian Yangtian and Mr. Wang Runqing are responsible for teaching.

Cantonese Music

Cantonese music is divided into Class A and Class B. Class A is the advanced class and Class B is the beginner class. Classes are held three times a week, from 7:45 pm to 8:45 pm. Class A and Class B take turns. The purpose of establishing the Cantonese music department is to enable members to study music, songs, and cultivate their sentiments. In addition to paying a deposit, members do not pay any fees. However, once registered, if you cannot attend classes on time, there will be penalties and you will be punished according to the rules. Students provide their own musical instruments, and Mr. Chen Junying is responsible for teaching. Not long ago, all the students in the class also participated in the Xin Xin Radio broadcast to raise funds to help refugees, and the results were quite good.

Harmonica

The harmonica team was recently established to promote popular music, with three classes per week, one hour each time. It specializes in teaching the latest harmonica playing methods, knowledge of musical symbols, popular Chinese and Western songs, and all the essentials of harmonica art. A period of three months, members pay a registration fee of one yuan, and non-members pay three yuan for the entire period. A harmonica specialist is hired to provide guidance.

Dance World Reflections: Xiao Tian's Fun in Visiting the Dance Hall

Mr. Liang Rengong said, "If I were to use chemistry to analyze this thing called Liang Qichao, and extract an element called 'fun' from it, I'm afraid there would only be zero left." Mr. Liang is an advocate of Hedonism. He once gave a footnote to the meaning of Hedonism, saying: "Anything done that does not produce a result contrary to fun can be the subject of fun." He also set the most important condition for Hedonism: "Doing what one does for the sake of doing it." That is to say, do not use what you do as a means and another thing as the end. For example, studying for a diploma is to obtain the diploma as the end and studying as the means; being an official to get rich is to get rich as the end and being an official as the means; being a monk and a philanthropist to defraud pious women of money is to defraud money as the end and being a monk and a philanthropist as the means; if the end is not achieved, it will produce a result contrary to fun.

Based on the above theory, I hope that people who like to visit dance halls should visit dance halls for the sake of visiting dance halls, and not for other purposes. If the purpose is to be lively and sociable, you can go to lively banquet places. If you like listening to Western music, you can turn on the radio at home. If the purpose is to pursue women, there are other opportunities to approach women besides dance halls. I agree with Mr. Liang's principle of Hedonism, but I do not agree with Mr. Liang's conclusion that there is no fun outside of learning. He said, "Is gambling fun? What if you lose? Is drinking fun? What if you get sick?" I think if you gamble for the sake of gambling, there is no point in discussing winning or losing. So-called winning is delightful, and losing is also happy. If you gamble to win money, it is better not to gamble. Therefore, before gambling, you must estimate how much money you can afford to lose, so that losing money will not produce a result contrary to fun. The same is true for drinking. Just remember the motto "Drinking without limit leads to chaos."

Of course, visiting dance halls is to find fun. If you want to find boredom, who in the world likes to find boredom? However, to maintain the fun from beginning to end, you must consider in advance: the first point is the economic problem, just like I said above, how much money you are prepared to lose when gambling. The second point is not to have a single object. For example, you love to have this dancer dance with you, but others also love to have this dancer dance with them, and others walk up to her first, or even call her to sit at the table or buy her out. At that time, if you do not regard this dancer as your only object, you can choose another dancer to dance with, and you can still feel fun. The third point is not to have other purposes besides dancing. Regarding this point, I have already said it above, but for the sake of completeness, I might as well say a few more words. For example, you like to dance with this dancer, so you ask her to dance, or even ask her to sit at the table, or buy a ticket to go to another dance hall, that's all fine, but you must not hope that she also likes to dance with you. If you love her and hope that she loves you, then your chances of disappointment may come, wouldn't it produce a result contrary to fun? Confucius said, "A gentleman seeks it in himself, a petty man seeks it in others." This can be applied here.

Shanghai's Comedic Ping Opera Troupes (Liang Yan)

Singing Ping Opera in a comedic way to bring laughter to the audience is indeed a kind of noble entertainment. Currently, there are as many as six such comedic Ping Opera troupes in the isolated island, each with its own merits, and they can cater to the audience's tastes. They also united to plead for the refugees and performed in a joint show at the Renewal Stage once, and the results were impressive, which shows that they are a popular troupe. Now, the lineup of each troupe is surveyed as follows:

New Voice Troupe

Starring Mi Yisu, Fang Xiaowu, Chen Wuwo, and Xu Xiaotian, recently joined by an eight-year-old prodigy, the lineup is the most complete, because only this troupe can be said to have: *sheng* (male roles), *dan* (female roles), *jing* (painted face roles), and *chou* (clown roles). The prodigy has a voice, has skills, and even more gags. Their specialties include "Scolding the Palace," "Scolding Cao," "Being Escorted," "Ganlu Temple," etc., and are currently performing in the Great World.

Elegant Troupe

The actors are Fang Renmi, Wang Mazi, and Zhang Haming. They have been working together for a long time, so they are the most skilled. Wang Mazi and Zhang Haming's performance of "Mending the Jar" is the most popular, and "Entering the Palace" and "Famen Temple" are also their specialties, performing at the Da Xin Amusement Park.

Sea New Troupe

This is an organization of three girls: Hua Yanyan, Ying Jing, and Feifei. They are very skilled in acting, but unfortunately, they are too young and lack experience, and have no gags. They are currently performing at the Yong'an Tianyun Building.

New Friend Troupe

Led by the female actor Wang Peijun, supplemented by Yang Shanyu and Da Pibao, these three are all from the Daheng class and each has its merits. Their masterpiece is "Borrowing the East Wind" and "The Empty City Stratagem", performing at the Da Xin Amusement Park.

Popular Troupe

Starring the former comedian from the north, Da Wawa, and supported by Sai Lanfang, Dai Xiaolin, and Ma Youliang. Their specialties are "Famen Temple" and "The Heavenly Maiden Scattering Flowers", and are currently performing in the New World.

Ming Yue Troupe

The actors are Ni Dongdong, Hong Luo Bu, and Da Mianbao. Their masterpiece is "Golden He". Performing at the Sincere Music Troupe.

I think each troupe has shortcomings: such as the noisy gong and drums are too long, they like to sing northern and southern ditties before singing Ping Opera, and they always sing these few operas, so I hope they improve so that the comedic Ping Opera has a bright future.

The Secret History of the Forbidden City Palace and the Pear Garden (129) by Xu Muyun

Because of Visiting Mother's Crossing the Border, Talk About the Relationship Between Empress Dowager Cixi and An Dehai

Today he was still the same as usual, so of course no one thought anything of it. Who would have thought that as soon as he straddled the mule, he suddenly turned the mule's head around, added a whip, and flew madly towards the pass. By the time the confidants sent by Prince Su pulled the horses over and chased after him, it was already too late. Moreover, his swift mule was used to this kind of daily morning exercise, so today it ran extraordinarily fast when something happened. Little Anzi arrived at the Imperial City in the blink of an eye, "proclaiming the imperial decree" to the ministers, and captured the rebel ministers such as Prince Su, welcoming the Empress Dowager back to Beijing. Therefore, the Empress Dowager attributed all the credit to An Dehai alone, so she later favored him very much. Little Anzi was young and handsome, with a shaved green scalp and a long braid, which made him even more lovable. He was also ignorant of worldly affairs and relied on his merits to be arrogant. Sometimes, he would even show frivolity and disrespect in front of the Empress Dowager, so outsiders said that An Dehai had an affair with the Empress Dowager and was a fake eunuch. Even the governors of the outer provinces heard this. Coincidentally, the Shandong Governor Ding Baozhen was introduced to the court. This man was from Pingyuan County, Guizhou, and was a *jinshi* (進士, successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations). He had helped quell the Miao rebellion and the Eastern and Western Nian rebellions. He was a resolute and upright person. An Dehai thought he was also bald, and without knowing the severity, he even laughed at him for being old. Ding Baozhen had originally heard of his deeds, and on top of that, he had been mocked today, so as soon as he left Beijing, he planned to make him his dinner. Unexpectedly, the damned Little Anzi insisted on asking for the errand of going to Beijing to make dragon robes. He brought a large number of people with him, swaggered along the way, and made a great show of power, harassing the people and coercing government officials. Who knows how many sins he committed. Just as he was about to arrive in Jinan, Shandong, Ding Baozhen received two imperial edicts from the Empress Dowager and a secret edict from the Emperor. According to the rumors at the time, it was said that the new Emperor and the civil and military officials of the court saw that Little Anzi was lawless, so they secretly conspired to trick him out of the capital so that they could get rid of him on a pretext. Therefore, they issued a secret edict ordering Ding Baozhen to kill him. Unexpectedly, the Empress Dowager heard about this and issued another imperial edict ordering Ding to protect him. She feared that her lover would be harmed, so she sent the imperial edict to Shandong with a rapid horse at 800 li (里, a Chinese unit of distance) per day. If it were someone else, they would have let Little Anzi pass. Old Ding wanted to avenge his personal grudges and also wanted to earn a reputation for being upright, so he disregarded everything and suppressed the imperial edict. When An Dehai arrived in Jinan, he announced the imperial edict, captured him, and according to the Qing law, inner eunuchs were royal slaves and were not allowed to leave Beijing even a step. Now, on the charge of "leaving Beijing without permission," he killed the once-popular An Dehai.

Opening Game Methods, Game 23

Black Moves First

Anti-Palace Horse Versus Central Cannon Horizontal Chariot Method

The Moves Connect to the Previous Game

Chariot 1 to 6, Chariot 9 to 2, Horse 8 Advances to 9, Pawn 7 Advances 1

(Explanation) The movement from Cannon 2 to 5 to Cannon 8 to 7 is all explained earlier. In the previous game, the black side's Horse 8 advanced to 7, but now it advances to 9, which is a side horse game. Its intention is not to attack the middle road. The horse advances slowly, which is a stable method. The black side's Chariot 9 advances 1, horizontal chariot, using a horizontal chariot against a horizontal chariot. Each has its own merits. Chariot 1 to 6, the opponent has already responded with a horizontal chariot, so moving to 6 first occupies the important road. Chariot 9 to 2 captures the horse, forcing Horse 8 to advance to 9. If the opponent does not capture at this time, then after the opponent's Sixth Chariot is promoted, the horse can advance to 6. Comparing advancing to 6 with a side horse, advancing to 6 is stronger. If the red side does not occupy the chariot road first, but advances the horse to 6 first, then the chariot has no road. Therefore, the black side's Chariot 9 advancing 1 is indeed a good move. In this game, the red side's opening game is very stable and quick, but the most taboo is that the opponent also deploys a horizontal chariot to force a surprise horse. Pawn 7 advancing 1 restricts the horse, preventing the activity of the third road horse, that is, preventing the side horse from taking root, which is a hidden restraining method. At this time, although the situation is not a major problem for both sides, the black side raising a horizontal chariot is slow, but the moves are tightening, and the momentum is eager to try. The red side is under pressure and seems difficult to move.
