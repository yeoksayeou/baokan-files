### British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon Announces the Establishment of Sino-British Financial Loan, Equalization Fund of £10 Million, British Assistance Half, Praises Chinese Government Stability and Legal Tender Success

(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that the plan to assist China's currency with a loan has been established, totaling £10 million. British bankers will underwrite half of the amount, guaranteed by the British government to prevent losses. The remaining half will be underwritten by two Chinese banks. It is said that the interest rate is extremely low, and various sectors related to the Far East have responded favorably to this plan. It is claimed that this loan plan is unrelated to any provisions regarding interest and repayment of China's various debts. Responsible individuals state that no actual defaults have occurred on debts secured by Chinese customs revenue thus far, and China has been paying other debts on schedule. Therefore, it is generally believed that China's ability to gain such great trust is due to its ability to maintain its credit despite the significant burden of war and the loss of much valuable territory, while some other countries, without the aforementioned difficulties, have defaulted on their maturing debts. Although this loan plan is now established, it cannot directly affect the monetary crisis in North China. Responsible parties indicate that the intention of this loan is undoubtedly to warn the Japanese that Britain will not allow its interests in China to disappear due to a lack of practical assistance. At the same time, it is also heard that various stringent measures are currently under careful consideration. Some parties are now pressuring the government to impose effective retaliation against Japan immediately if Japan does not abolish its current regulations restricting British interests and freedom in China. Many people who previously supported a moderate policy have now changed their opinions and believe that retaliation is the only hope for obtaining satisfaction. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced that the Treasury has agreed to provide a guarantee against losses to two British banks and is drafting a bill to submit to Parliament for approval. The Chancellor's remarks were in response to a question from Labour MP Lawrence, who asked the Chancellor to comment on suggestions for helping China maintain the stability of the true value of its legal tender. The Chancellor rose and said, "The stability of China's legal tender is of utmost importance to Britain, given our financial and economic relationship with China. The Chinese government has been working for many months to maintain the legal tender, facilitate commercial transactions, and ensure reasonable stability in its exchange rate. This has been a great success. The Chinese government has informed the British government that it intends to continue its current monetary policy and is willing to establish a fund of £10 million in addition to reserves to stabilize the legal tender as part of this policy. It has asked two Chinese government banks to undertake £5 million, and the remaining £5 million has been offered to two British banks, namely HSBC and Mercantile Bank. These two banks have agreed to undertake this amount, but any losses incurred at the end of this fund must be compensated by the Treasury. The Treasury will provide this guarantee. The tentative arrangement is that the operation of this fund will be limited to twelve months, but at the end of the period, it can be extended for a period of time by mutual agreement. However, if necessary, this fund can be terminated at any earlier time. The British government welcomes the establishment of this fund, which, if used properly, will greatly contribute to British trade and enterprise in China. The Treasury has been awaiting parliamentary approval before granting the requested guarantee to the two British banks." The Chancellor concluded, "I hope to introduce the bill early next week." The Chancellor also stated in response to various supplementary questions that the British government's primary responsibility for any outcome will be to appropriately compensate the two British banks, but any profits made by the British banks as a result will be transferred to the British Treasury. Labour MP Bellenger then asked whether Britain had consulted with the United States beforehand. The Chancellor replied that he believed this action would be widely welcomed and that other countries had contributed in various ways. He hoped that when the case was submitted to the House of Commons, the House would also consider it an appropriate contribution. Another MP asked whether the British government had the right to speak on the management of this fund. The Chancellor replied that the stabilization fund will be managed by a committee that will include a representative responsible to the British government. (8th Reuters)

### Chinese Troops in Hubei Recover Several Key Points, Situation on Leizhou Peninsula Extremely Tense, Japanese Troops on Jingzhong Road Retreat Southeast After Being Attacked, Japanese Troops Attacking Langang in Sanshui Repelled by Chinese Artillery Fire, Elite Guangxi Troops Arrive in Southern Route for Reinforcements

Yicheng: Most of the Japanese troops on Jingzhong Road are now retreating southeast. Because some Chinese troops took advantage of the Japanese troops' northern advance yesterday and today to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese rear, the Japanese troops, fearing that their return route would be cut off by the Chinese troops, retreated one after another. Some Chinese troops have recovered Yonglong River, Yanmenkou, Wamiaoji, and other key points, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers and destroying eight Japanese tanks. In the Zhongxiang area, only five or six hundred Japanese soldiers frequently fired artillery at the Chinese side today to create a show of force. The Japanese troops north of Zhongxiang, surrounded by the Chinese on both wings, are in a difficult situation. (8th dispatch)

Shashi: The war in central Hubei is extremely fierce. Chinese troops from all directions are actively counterattacking and have made many gains. Chinese troops on the Hanyi Road are approaching Wamiaoji. Five or six hundred Japanese soldiers and more than twenty tanks in Sanyangdian have been attacked by Chinese troops many times, and the Japanese have suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese troops in Xiantao Town were annihilated, and Xiantao Town has been recovered. (7th dispatch)

Sihui: On the morning of the 7th, more than one hundred Japanese soldiers, accompanied by three cannons, advanced from Sanshui to harass Langang. Chinese troops bravely launched an attack, occupied the area north of Langang, and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese troops. At that time, Chinese artillery at Mafang provided artillery support across the river, and several shells hit the Japanese positions, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated towards Mianyang in Sanshui. (8th dispatch)

Yicheng: More than a thousand Japanese infantry and cavalry went north this morning from Zhuangwangmiao between Zhongxiang and Daokou. Among them, more than a hundred people took three boats and tried to forcibly cross the Huangcheng Temple at the estuary of the Zhongxiang River. The Chinese defenders waited for their boats to reach the middle of the river and launched a fierce attack, sinking one boat immediately. The remaining two boats, seeing the situation was bad, fled back. (8th dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Guangzhou Bay News: The situation on the Leizhou Peninsula is extremely tense. On the 4th and 5th, Leizhou City was bombed by Japanese aircraft, and Kangren Hospital and the library were bombed. Commerce has ceased, and most refugees have gone to Suixi. Japanese warships are gathered on the sea off Xuwen, planning to send troops to land. (8th special dispatch)

(Chongqing) After the Chinese troops withdrew from Zhongxiang, a part of the guerrillas remained in the city to engage in street fighting. It is said that after the Japanese troops entered the city, they were repeatedly attacked by Chinese troops and hit many landmines, causing a large number of casualties. The cost they paid was very high. The majority of the Chinese military strength west of the Pinghan Railway is about seventy divisions, totaling about 300,000 men, which is sufficient to prevent the Japanese army from advancing westward. It is also learned that a team of B troops, which had sneaked near Suixian County, was annihilated by the Chinese army. As a result, the threat to the left flank of the Chinese army has now been lifted. (8th news agency dispatch)

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources in Guilin, three elite divisions of the Guangxi army have successively arrived in the southern part of Guangdong Province to reinforce. General Bai Chongxi, director of the Southwest Military Affairs Office, has appointed General Wei Yunsong to be responsible for commanding the southern route army and has sent more than ten senior staff officers to inspect the defenses in various parts of the southern route. (8th news agency dispatch)

(Hankou) According to news received here, due to continuous heavy rains in central Hubei, the river has flooded, and the inside and outside of Zhongxiang city have been completely flooded. The residents have already scattered. When the Japanese troops entered the city, it had almost become a dead city with no one in sight. (8th news agency dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to a well-informed foreigner in Yichang, the Associated Press reported that the Japanese army has occupied Anlu, so the situation in Yichang is quite tense. It is impossible to speculate whether the Japanese army will cross the Hanshui River to attack or advance north to Xi'an. According to the Chinese military authorities, the Associated Press reported that the Chinese army is prepared to deal with the Japanese army's attack along the Pinghan Railway in Henan Province and the Longhai Railway in Henan Province. After occupying Anlu, the Japanese army's next target may be Xiangyang, and then advance from Xiangyang to Laohekou, because Laohekou is an important point for shipping on the Hanshui River.

### More Than Forty Japanese Aircraft Bomb Yichang Madly All Day Long, More Than One Hundred Bombs Dropped, One-Third of the City's Houses Destroyed

(Yichang) Today, from more than 8:00 in the morning to about 4:00 in the afternoon, more than forty Japanese aircraft dropped about one hundred bombs on the city. The bombed area accounted for about seven-tenths of the city, and more than one-third of the houses were destroyed. The number of casualties is under investigation. (8th dispatch)

Certain location: Japanese aircraft flew to Yichang three times on the 8th to bomb it. The first time was at 10:00 in the morning with eighteen planes, the second time was at 3:00 in the afternoon with nine planes, and the third time was at 4:00 in the afternoon with eighteen planes. Japanese aircraft indiscriminately bombed the urban area and fled. Many civilian houses in the city were destroyed, and many civilians were killed and injured. Details have not yet been reported. (8th dispatch)

Changde: Six Japanese aircraft invaded the airspace over this city at 11:20 a.m. on the 8th and dropped more than twenty bombs in the Mamiao Bridge and Yinyang Bridge area outside the north gate. They went north through Anxiang and Huarong and fled. After investigation, the bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft all landed in deserted suburbs and ponds. There was no major damage to residential houses. Only four farmers were killed and twelve men and women were injured. (8th dispatch)

### The Japanese Army's Invasion and Plunder is Not a Fact

(Chongqing) According to the official report obtained here, the rumor that the Japanese army has occupied Baoying is not a fact. Baoying is located in the northeast of Jiangsu Province and is easy to defend due to the dangers of Baoying Lake and the Grand Canal. It is also the seat of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Here yesterday, we also received a telegram from Han Deming, chairman of Jiangsu Province, reporting on the situation of the war against Japan. (8th news agency dispatch)

### The Purpose of Trade Control by the Puppet Organization is to Promote "United Notes", Foreign Interests Will Be Excluded, Britain Must Retaliate Against Japan

(Tianjin) A major businessman here met with a Reuters reporter and said that the hidden purpose of the new regulations on trade and foreign exchange control seems to be to force foreign banks to accept "United Reserve Notes" and to give the notes an exchange value that they do not currently have. The businessman added, "Although the Provisional Government claims that the legal tender is worthless from March 10, most of the legal tender is still circulating in the interior, so it is doubtful whether it will be greatly affected by this order. If foreign governments allow their nationals to agree to this new regulation, it is tantamount to allowing the 'Provisional Government' that they do not recognize to have the power to control North China's trade. The result will inevitably be that the foreign interests established over the years will be excluded. Manchuria can be taken as an example. Although the new regulations are issued in an attitude of seeking foreign cooperation, their ultimate goal is undoubtedly to benefit Japan and exclude foreign interests. The only way to remedy this now is for the British government to take appropriate retaliatory measures against Japanese trade." (8th Reuters dispatch)

Editorial

### Expanding the Aid China Movement

Since the United Kingdom and the United States implemented economic aid to China at the end of last year, they have established huge lines of credit for China. According to yesterday's report, the British government has decided to provide China with two more large loans. The first loan is £3 million, which will be used exclusively to consolidate China's legal tender system; the second loan is to expand the limits on export credit guarantees to China. The amount that has been drafted is £5 million, and its purpose is to purchase British transportation equipment and develop China's southwestern international transportation. At the same time, it is also reported that the new loan from the United States to China will also be signed and established. In addition, a friendly European country is also preparing to provide large-scale economic assistance to China. Judging from these news, the international aid China movement has become more and more active recently.

The situation in the Far East has now reached a very serious stage. It is also a very appropriate opportunity for the international community to step up its assistance to China. We see that Japan is blockading China's land and water transportation in the occupied areas of China, controlling China's commerce and finance, destroying all public and private industries of foreigners in China, and threatening the remaining spheres of influence of foreigners in China, the concessions. This is already well known. However, Japan's ambition of aggression is not satisfied with controlling the occupied areas in China and excluding foreign forces in China. Recently, when there was no way to deal with the war against China, it launched its so-called southward policy, preparing to extend its aggressive claws to other parts of the Far East outside of China. The White Army's landing on Hainan Island last month was a direct demonstration to French Indochina, and the bombing of the British Kowloon leased territory border was an even more obvious provocation to Britain. At the same time, Japan is also carrying out various coercive and tempting disruptive activities in other parts of the Far East. For example, in Burma, Japan sends a large number of monks, nuns, merchants, and students to carry out anti-British propaganda, trying to incite the Burmese people to rebel; for Portuguese Macau, because it could not obtain the Portuguese government's promise to supply the Japanese army, it even insulted and arrested the Portuguese consul in Hankou; for the Philippines' plan to block Taifu Port in order to consolidate national defense, Japan also made unreasonable protests on the grounds that it was detrimental to Japan; for the oil-rich Dutch East Indies, it is always coveting and seizing it. In short, Japan has regarded the entire Far East as something in her grasp, and she will never allow any European or American country to leave a trace of power in the Far East. This is the practice of the slogan "Asia for Asians" that Japan often shouts. We believe that in the near future, perhaps when her European comrades make colonial demands again, Japan will launch a large-scale war in Asia on the pretext of cutting off China's international transportation. Now, European and American countries that have relations with the Far East generally feel that it is urgent to find a way to defend themselves. Britain has built strong defensive fortifications in Singapore and Hong Kong, the Netherlands is also strengthening military equipment in the East Indies, and France is actively strengthening the army and air force in Vietnam to prevent violent invasion. However, these methods cannot prevent the aggressive forces from attacking. The only way to prevent the aggressive forces from attacking is to actively aid China.

At the beginning of the month, British Labour Party MP Lord Strabolgi gave a speech in the House of Lords, saying, "If we observe the situation with a long-term perspective, we will see that China is fighting for us." What a bold and insightful remark! Indeed, this war of resistance by China is not only fighting to safeguard its own national rights, but also fighting for the democratic system that the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries value in the same way, and also fighting to preserve the political and economic rights and interests of European and American countries in the Far East. Moreover, in the current situation in the Far East, only the victory of China's war of resistance can preserve the stability of the rights and interests of European and American countries in the Far East. Now, China's war of resistance is approaching its final victory, and friendly countries are urgently needed to provide assistance in military and economic aspects. All countries that have relations with the Far East should actively aid China for justice when this Sino-Japanese war is about to enter a decisive stage, and even more actively aid China to protect their own rights and interests in the Far East. British Sir Victor Sassoon recently returned to China and gave a public speech, advocating that Britain should actively aid China, which best shows the true views of those who have been in China for a long time and know the national conditions of China.

The international aid China movement does have a tendency to become more and more consistent. However, merely providing economic assistance to China can strengthen China's strength in the war of resistance, but it may not be able to force Japan to change its attempt to dominate the Pacific. If democratic countries want to resolutely curb the development of Japan's aggressive ambitions, they must go a step further, expand the scope of aid to China, and take economic sanctions against Japan from the opposite side, which will make it easier to end its war of aggression in the shortest possible time.

### Chongqing Women Commemorate March 8th; Soong Mei-ling Delivers a Speech; Striving to Enhance National Status; Considering Herself a Servant of the People; Bearing the Responsibility of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction

(Chongqing) The 8th was the March 8th International Women's Day. The Women's Guidance Committee of the New Life Movement General Association called on all women's organizations in Chongqing, all girls' schools, and women from all walks of life to solemnly and enthusiastically commemorate the day. In the morning, anti-Japanese war films were shown free of charge in various cinemas, welcoming women to visit. In the afternoon, a Chongqing Women's Commemoration of March 8th Conference was held in the City Chamber of Commerce. Over 20,000 women attended. Chairman Zhang Ai-zhen briefly described the history and significance of International Women's Day. Afterwards, Ma Chao-jun, representative of the Central Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, followed by instructions from Madame Chiang. Amidst warm applause, Madame Chiang stood up and delivered her instructions. After her speech, the applause continued for several minutes. Subsequently, Ms. Powell from the International Women's Association in America, a representative from the Korean Women's Association, and Old Madam Zhang, a representative of the families of soldiers fighting the war, delivered speeches in succession. Representatives from various women's organizations, including Li Lan, Deng Yingchao, and Liu Hengjing, then delivered speeches on behalf of their respective organizations. Following this, they passed telegrams of greetings to women worldwide and to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and the soldiers at the front, as well as telegrams of condolences to the families of soldiers who had gone to war. Finally, they passed a declaration from the conference, shouted slogans, and adjourned the meeting. The atmosphere at the venue was enthusiastic. After the meeting, they formed a procession with torches, shouting slogans and singing anti-Japanese war songs along the way, with high spirits. The meeting dispersed around 9 o'clock. (8th dispatch)

(Chongqing) The full text of Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling's speech at the March 8th Commemoration Meeting is as follows: Fellow compatriots, today we are holding this meeting to commemorate March 8th. The decision to designate March 8th as International Women's Day was made at a meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1909. Today marks exactly 30 years since that decision, making it the 30th anniversary of March 8th. Today, when our Republic of China is facing enemy invasion and national hardship, as we simultaneously resist the war and build the nation, holding this important commemoration will undoubtedly bring special feelings to each of us. As you all know, the significance of March 8th lies in seeking women's liberation. However, so-called women's liberation is not just about achieving liberation; it requires the efforts of our female compatriots to enhance the status of our nation, allowing national life to be influenced by women, thereby raising its spiritual and material standards, and enabling the majority, or even all, of our compatriots to enjoy independence, freedom, equality, and happiness. We must recognize that women's liberation should not be seen merely as a right but as a responsibility. Why do we seek women's liberation? It is to fulfill our responsibilities as women. In other words, if we truly seek women's liberation, we must first be able to shoulder our responsibilities. Our Founding Father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, gave a speech in 1924 with some very important words. He said, "The reason why the revolution has not succeeded is that individuals fight for freedom and forget the freedom of the nation. We must understand that if the nation has no freedom, individuals cannot have freedom." This is an absolutely true principle. When we talk about women's liberation today, we must also realize that if the nation is not liberated, women throughout the country cannot achieve true liberation. Today, our country is being bullied and invaded by the enemy, and the entire nation is under the heavy weight of violence, with compatriots displaced and suffering. If we do not first rescue this endangered nation, all 450 million of us will become slaves of a conquered nation. Where can we talk about women's liberation then? Who can we demand women's liberation from? I often say that women's liberation depends on our own efforts as women. If our knowledge and abilities as women continue to improve, and if we make tangible contributions to the nation and to humanity, women's status will naturally rise. Some people may think that women's participation in politics is the first step towards achieving women's liberation. This may be true. Modern countries cannot deny women the right to participate in politics. However, the true meaning of women's liberation is not merely about a few women gaining political and economic status; it is about alleviating the suffering of the majority of women and improving the lives of most of our female compatriots, starting with education and organization, to enhance women's abilities and raise their status. Moreover, practically speaking, it is not enough to talk only about women's liberation. We must also use the power of our women to achieve the liberation of the entire nation, only then will we have fulfilled our responsibility.

Many representatives of women's organizations are present today, including women from the intellectual sphere, women from the professional sphere, and women from the laboring sphere. Among the tens of thousands of female compatriots, we are considered relatively capable and have a certain status. Even if we cannot be called visionaries, we are at least above average. We must think about how we can live up to our own knowledge and abilities, how we can live up to the education and training we have received, and how we can be worthy of our nation and the era in which we live. Especially important, how should our many women's organizations contribute to the general public? Let me tell you a story. I remember when Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands was young, her father had already passed away. One day, on her tenth birthday, her mother held a celebration for her, and tens of thousands of men and women came to the palace to congratulate her. The young queen was overjoyed and deeply moved by this enthusiastic scene. She asked her mother, "Do these people belong to me?" Her mother said, "No, they do not belong to you, but you belong to them." I hope that the female compatriots present today will also recognize that we belong to the people, not the people to us. When we engage in any activity, we must not think that we can control the people, but rather consider ourselves servants of the people. We must approach the people, immerse ourselves among them, sincerely serve our compatriots, educate them, help them, relieve their suffering, and create their happiness. In this extraordinary period, the welfare of the nation and the people are united. If we cannot achieve victory in the War of Resistance, our nation will not survive. If our national reconstruction is not successful, none of us will have any happiness.

Today, our female compatriots must all assess the extent of their knowledge and abilities and determine the weight of their responsibilities. The greater one's knowledge and abilities, the heavier one's responsibilities. We must have passion, perseverance, methods, and, more importantly, organization to undertake various tasks related to the War of Resistance. We must promote thrift, encourage production, advance social education, preside over relief efforts, encourage joining the military to kill the enemy, and assist in the propaganda of the War of Resistance. Anything that benefits the War of Resistance and national reconstruction that men can undertake, we must also take on without hesitation. Especially important, and something that most women can do, I believe nothing surpasses comforting and assisting the families of soldiers who have gone to war. We must regularly comfort the families of soldiers at the front and the families of fallen soldiers, to give them spiritual comfort. We must also help them become self-reliant, such as by organizing handicrafts, organizing manual labor, teaching agricultural production techniques, and helping organize cooperatives, so that they do not experience economic and living difficulties. We must also help them solve the problem of their children's education. In this way, soldiers who have gone to war will have no worries about the home front, and the general public will enthusiastically respond to the call to join the army. If we have a smooth way to promote the conscription system, the War of Resistance will surely be victorious, and the nation will be guaranteed. I believe that with the spirit of our women, we will certainly be able to contribute greatly to the War of Resistance. Just look at the achievements of the women's donation day on Sunday, which can give us real confidence. Why can women's donations achieve such results? It is entirely because we are organized, united, and have a spirit of perseverance and hard work. Our women can mobilize uniformly, without distinguishing between each other, and contribute all of our strengths, whether large or small, to achieve such results. However, I believe that we have many tasks, and not every task needs to have obvious achievements on the surface. Our work is only initiated by our patriotic conscience and responsibility. We should not hope for boasting, praise, or encouragement, but bury ourselves in more realistic work. The more work that is not sought to be known, the greater the effect. We work hard and practically to be unsung heroes, not seeking personal honor, but seeking the honor of the nation and the people through collective efforts. In this way, we will surely be able to improve the status of our women and achieve our more lofty goals in practical work.

Fellow compatriots, this war of resistance is a war between justice and violence, a critical moment for the survival of the nation, and the prelude to the nation's revival. We should now ask nothing, care for nothing, and concentrate on winning the War of Resistance. We must know that justice and righteousness belong to us, and the sympathy of all mankind in the world belongs to us. Let me give a few examples to prove this. First, let me present to you a precious gift. It was taken from the body of an Indian woman. She said, "She has deep hatred for the brutality of the Japanese bandits, infinite sympathy for our Chinese War of Resistance, and is deeply moved by the efforts of our Chinese female compatriots in the War of Resistance. She has nothing to express, so she took off her only property, the ornament she always wears, and donated it to China." Please take a look, how much deep affection is entrusted in this string of loops. The second is that we received a letter from an American blind girl, with an attached gold yuan. She said in the letter that she was an unfortunate woman, but when she heard that China was being ravaged by the enemy so cruelly, and the suffering of Chinese boys and girls was so deep, she could understand the enemy's cruel behavior towards China and was not blind. She felt she should no longer complain about her misfortune, and expressed shame. She also expressed infinite excitement at the courage of Chinese female compatriots engaged in the War of Resistance. This letter and a gold yuan from thousands of miles away are truly moving. The third is that I received a letter from another foreign woman. She said that her fiancé and friends were killed while traveling, and she herself suffered from hemiplegia. However, driven by the concept of justice and humanity, she was very concerned about the Sino-Japanese War, reading newspapers every day and praying for China's victory. The doctor was afraid that she would be too stimulated and even forbade her to read the newspaper. She could not write letters herself, so she had to ask her friends to write them for her. This letter hoped that our Chinese compatriots could persevere and strive for final victory. You must know that I have received several letters from abroad every day recently. The above are just a few examples. We see that foreign friends thousands of miles away are still like this, how should we, daughters of the Chinese nation, encourage ourselves and spur ourselves to save our country and seek the liberation of our nation? With our own sacrifices and struggles, we can seek the liberation of the country and the true liberation of tens of thousands of female compatriots. I am very confident that we will be able to achieve our aspirations. I hope that the female compatriots present today will be determined, fight forward, and write the most glorious page in the history of the world women's movement. (8th dispatch)

### The Sichuan-Xikang Construction Inspection Group Holds Its First Discussion Meeting; Members Depart in Five Groups Mid-Month for Inspections; Focusing on Conscription, Officialdom Governance, and Drug Prohibition

### The Trial Flight Between Chongqing and Hami is Completed; Total Distance is 2,700 Kilometers; Flight Takes Two Days

(Chongqing) According to Chinese officials today, the trial flight between Chongqing and Hami in Xinjiang has been completed. The distance between Chongqing and Hami is 2,700 kilometers, and the total flight time is set at two days. The aircraft used for this trial flight was a German three-engine Junkers "Ju 1" type. It is said that the Ministry of Communications has decided to use this type of aircraft for flights between Chongqing and Hami. The pilot for this trial flight was a Chinese pilot. It has also been decided to employ Chinese pilots in regular flights. Most of these pilots are graduates of the Chinese Army Aviation School. During their time at the school, they received rigorous training in the operation of various types of aircraft, so they are more than capable of being used as civil aviation pilots. According to the spokesperson, the reason why this Northwest airline had previously failed was purely due to the poor management of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has decided to operate the route itself, with one round trip per week. It is expected to officially open within this month. If necessary, this route will be extended to Alma-Ata on the Turkestan-Siberia Railway in the Soviet Union, in order to establish direct contact with the Soviet Union. (7th United Press dispatch)

### Military Spokesman Discusses the Week's War Situation

(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission discussed the week's war situation, stating that the situation in central Hubei and northern Jiangsu was relatively intense, while the various fronts in the north and south were also more active than last week. However, under the loyal and courageous resistance of all our officers and soldiers, the enemy's conspiracies and insidious plans have not succeeded. Their final struggles and inevitable destruction are enough to encourage us to continue our efforts and unleash an increasingly strong force. The week's war situation is recorded as follows:

(1) Guangdong Area: There have been no intense battles in the Guangzhou area and other regions this week. In addition to continuing to build fortifications and engage in stubborn defense at various key points, the enemy has also strengthened air defense facilities in various locations to guard against our air raids. They have also distributed leaflets, pictorials, cakes, and other items everywhere, attempting to deceive the public. However, they have been constantly resisted and attacked by our people. The enemy's plans have not succeeded. On the other hand, our troops in Huaxian launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops entrenched in Xinminpu on the morning of the 3rd. The Japanese troops fought in panic, and more than 200 were killed and scattered to Daling. The Chinese side captured Xinminpu. Another unit encountered a fierce battle with the Japanese troops in Lizhi'ao, between Huaxian and Conghua, on the 4th. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated, with more than 100 Japanese soldiers killed. On Hainan Island, in the south, Japanese troops in Haikou, Qiongshan, Chengmai, Ding'an, and Wenchang have been repeatedly attacked by various guerrilla units of the Chinese army, resulting in fierce battles and the deaths of more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers. At present, important strongholds such as a certain place between Chengmai are still in the hands of the Chinese army. The Japanese troops are only confined to the county towns and their vicinity and have become unable to move.

(2) Central Hubei Area: Since invading Yuekou last week, the Japanese troops entrenched in Tianmen have repeatedly attempted to cross the Xiang River with a large number of troops this week to invade Qianjiang. They were flanked by the defending troops on both sides of the Chinese side, and many Japanese soldiers were killed. They are currently still confronting the Japanese troops near Wamiaoji on the north bank of the river. The Japanese forces are exhausted and unable to attack again. The Japanese troops who invaded Zhongxiang along Pingba, Guanqiao, and Yanmenkou have seen the fighting intensify since the 2nd. The Chinese troops resisted step by step, and the Japanese suffered extremely heavy losses. By the morning of the 5th, the Japanese troops divided into three routes to launch a fierce attack. One route of 3,000-4,000 troops advanced along the Jingzhong Highway to the east of the county seat; another route of 3,000-4,000 troops advanced to the north of the county seat from Dongqiaozhen on the right side of the highway; and a third route of 2,000-3,000 troops advanced to the south of the county seat from Jiukou in the north, adopting a pincer formation. They fought a bloody battle with the Chinese troops in the Hangjiaji, Yangjiamiao, and Longjiadian areas. The Chinese officers and soldiers responded calmly, killing over 1,000 Japanese soldiers. By noon, the Japanese forces were greatly frustrated and suddenly released a large amount of highly toxic gas on the Chinese positions. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented in recent months. Although many Chinese officers and soldiers were poisoned, they were able to continue fighting after bandaging their wounds, killing countless more Japanese soldiers. The area has now entered a state of mixed warfare. More than 4,000 Japanese troops in the northwestern region of Hubei Province, after harassing Yujiadian last week, have engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese troops at Jiehe and Xindian this week. The Japanese troops have suffered hundreds of casualties, and their fierce offensive has been curbed. They are currently still in a stalemate with the Chinese troops near Yujiadian. To the east of Suixian, the war situation is currently stabilizing. (To be continued)

### Formal Sino-Burmese Air Service Still Requires Time

(Kunming) Regarding the formal commencement of Sino-Burmese air service, a representative from the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) stated that although formal service was initially planned for this month, trial flights conducted by both Chinese and British parties revealed certain incompatibilities in equipment. Further discussions are also needed on various aspects. Therefore, formal commencement will require more time, and it is unlikely to be realized this month. (Dispatch, 8th)

### Spanish Civil War Nearing End, Britain Pays More Attention to the Far East, Cabinet to Discuss Economic Boycott Today, Japan Exhausted and Increasingly Anxious

(Paris) The right-wing Parisian newspaper Le Figaro recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent stating: "With the Spanish problem nearing its end, British political figures are gradually finding relief and are therefore able to pay increasing attention to the Far East problem. When the cabinet meets tomorrow, it will discuss the Far East situation. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax are expected to make great efforts in the short term to end the Sino-Japanese War. Regardless of the impact on humanitarian and political considerations, the continuation of the Sino-Japanese War poses a risk of bankruptcy to British commercial interests in the Far East, which cannot be ignored. Furthermore, British naval bases in the Far East are under threat from Japan, and this development cannot be tolerated. Therefore, it is inevitable that the British government will adopt a firm attitude toward Japan."

The right-wing newspaper Le Figaro also published a dispatch from its London correspondent stating: "After the improvement of the situation in the Mediterranean, the British government can shift its focus to the Far East problem. It will soon lend China three to five million pounds and, at the same time, take economic measures in conjunction with the U.S. government to deal with Japan. Economic means, when used at the appropriate time, are the most effective weapon. Japan has been at war for nearly two years and is exhausted. Therefore, its fear of economic pressure from Britain and the United States is even greater than it was two years ago. Its territorial ambitions may therefore be somewhat restrained, which is not impossible." (Havas dispatch, 8th)

(Tokyo) Since the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry ordered that the prices of thirteen types of goods should not exceed the market prices before March 4th, friction between the Japanese government and merchants has become even more tense. The commodities affected by this price restriction order include cotton, sugar, nails, coffee, and zinc. Regarding the price of silk fabrics, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry stipulates that it should not exceed the market price on January 10th. Japanese silk merchants are extremely dissatisfied with this government restriction, and in fact, the price of silk fabrics has increased by 40% to 50% since January 10th. The Japanese government believes that such soaring prices are excessive. Since the government intervened, the price of raw silk weighing one hundred pounds has increased by 1,000 yen per bale, hovering around 975 yen per bale after the government's restriction order. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)

(Tokyo) During the discussion of the budget案 in the Lower House this morning, a member of parliament questioned the supply of arms and ammunition to the Chinese government by foreign countries after Japan occupied Hainan Island. Minister of War Itagaki replied that most of the military supplies entering China via French Vietnam were transported by rail, while those passing through Burma were transported along the river by French ships. The transportation of heavy armaments did not pass through Burma or Vietnam. Aircraft and other war materials were currently being supplied to China by the Soviet Union. When asked whether the special military expenditure budget for the "China Incident" meant that the combat area would not expand, Itagaki replied that Japan had already established a policy for the "China Incident" and would not disclose future war plans. Subsequently, when asked about the necessity of using diplomatic methods, Itagaki replied that it was regrettable that foreign countries did not understand the "New Situation in East Asia."

### Madrid: Communist Uprising Fails, Overnight Street Fighting Has Ended, Peace Agreement May Be Concluded in Two Weeks

Madrid: The Communist Party launched an uprising last night against the National Defense Committee, leading to street fighting in the city that lasted all night until this afternoon when it was quelled. The National Defense Committee mobilized a large army, using tanks and aircraft to assist in suppressing the rebellion. The situation was serious, as can be seen. Communist Party members in the suburbs continued to exchange fire with government troops this morning for three hours, until they were defeated by the government troops' tanks. Some party members in the city refused to surrender, hiding in civilian houses and firing on the streets. At 2:30 PM, an air raid alert was heard. Aircraft dispatched by the National Defense Committee bombed civilian houses where the Communists were resisting. Soon after, the Communist Party members surrendered, and the gunfire ceased. Order was restored, but soldiers remained stationed in major buildings, and the army patrolled the streets. Premier Miaja personally inspected the city on foot in the afternoon, and the people cheered for him. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### Establishing a Guerrilla Command Post on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Line, Recruiting Unreformed Units, Japanese Troops Repeatedly Defeated in Qingpu

In order to coordinate with the second phase of the War of Resistance and support the front lines, Gu Zhutong, commander of the 3rd War Area, has strengthened the organization of civilian armed forces in the guerrilla areas of southern Jiangsu and established the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Guerrilla Command Post in the area along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Line. From now on, the guerrilla units in the above-mentioned area will be under the command of this command post to facilitate unified command. It is expected that there will be new developments soon.

### Recruiting Various Units

In the guerrilla areas, young people who automatically pledge allegiance to the country are very enthusiastic. Therefore, there are still many units that have not been reorganized by the National Government. The National Government has specially telegraphed various provinces and cities to extensively recruit and dispatch a certain Zhan to organize the unreformed units in the guerrilla areas. It is reported that after receiving the order from the Central Government, Zhan has dispatched certain Zhou and certain Xu to Caohe, Beixinjing, Zhenru, Kunshan, Suzhou, Changzhou, and the area along Taihu Lake to reorganize the unreformed units. Zhan has already appointed Xu as the deputy detachment commander of the 9th Detachment of the Mobile Corps in the Zhenru area. It is expected that there will soon be a well-organized and sound unit organization in the guerrilla area.

### Fierce Battle in Zhangyan

According to people from Qingpu, since the Japanese troops stationed in the city, instigated by the puppet "Magistrate" Yao Miaoling, launched a large-scale attack on the guerrilla unit of Yuan in Tianma Mountain on the 1st of this month and failed, they have retreated to the city and tightly closed the city gates, only opening a north gate for passage, and preventing the guerrillas from attacking the city. The situation is extremely tense. Recently, in order to open up the transportation line to Huangdu, which is 30 li away, and obtain assistance from the Japanese troops in Huangzhen, they dispatched 40 to 50 Japanese soldiers on several motorboats at noon on the 4th to probe northward along the river. However, the guerrilla unit of Wei, stationed in Zhangyan Town, 17 to 18 li away from the north city, learned of this and believed that the opportunity had arrived. They quickly dispatched hundreds of soldiers to intercept and surround them outside the town. The Japanese soldiers abandoned their boats and landed to resist. The Chinese army used its dual advantage in numbers and geography to inflict heavy blows on the 50 Japanese soldiers, killing or wounding more than half of them. They hurriedly returned to their boats and fled back to Qingcheng. Two hours later, the Japanese army launched a new attack on Zhangyan from Qingpu, Huangdu, Xujing, Baihegang, and other four routes. The Wei unit was unwilling to show weakness and immediately opened fire. The sound of gunfire and artillery fire intertwined. After two hours of fierce fighting, they completed their attrition strategy and temporarily withdrew to prepare for another attack in the evening. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army completely retreated when the sky was about to darken. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered many more casualties, and several guerrillas also sacrificed their lives.

### Jieyang Investigates and Eradicates Opium Seedlings, County Magistrate Strictly Prohibits Extortion

A correspondent from Shantou reports that Jieyang County is the most prosperous area in eastern Guangdong in terms of agricultural products, with more than 1.5 million mu of arable land, producing enough rice and cane sugar annually to feed its 700,000+ residents with a surplus. In previous years, local sugar sales in the north were valued at over one million silver dollars, representing the largest export of local products in the Chaoshan region. Last year, the new-style sugar factory in Qu River was bombed, and the villages continued to use the old method of producing local sugar, transporting it by land to inland areas in Fujian and Jiangxi. However, due to excessive transportation costs, prices fell, making sugar cane farmers unprofitable. They switched to planting peculiar flowers. These flowers are shaped like inverted bells, currently blooming in abundance in the fields, with red, white, and purple colors interspersed, stretching as far as the eye can see. Farmers dare not plant them openly along roadsides and in areas with high pedestrian traffic. They are particularly lush in the remote mountainous areas of the second and fifth districts. Successive county governments have issued announcements prohibiting opium seedlings, but these peculiar flowers seem to have no connection with the announcements, having become a well-known open secret. In February of last year, a certain Xie in Tatou Township clashed with the county government's guards over tax collection, resulting in several deaths. The matter was eventually resolved through an ambiguous method. Chen, the county magistrate of Jieyang, took office in February and heard that opium seedlings were blooming and bearing fruit in villages from Mianhu to Hepo. He issued an official document ordering the police chiefs of the relevant districts to convene meetings of the heads of villages and baojia, demanding that each village chief clear the seedlings within five days and not wait and see. However, the villages did not comply. On February 26th, he dispatched a squadron of administrative police, along with the second squadron of the standing volunteer corps, to the villages of Mianhu and Hepo to supervise the villagers in eradicating the opium. Before the team departed, Magistrate Chen personally instructed all officers and soldiers not to use the name of opium eradication to extort a single cent from the villages or accept petty bribes such as tea or wine money. Once discovered, they would be severely punished.

### Guangdong's Northwest River Front Consolidated, Japanese Army Attempts to Control the East River, Chinese Side's New Deployment Completed

A correspondent from Guangzhou reports that since the invading Japanese army shifted its direction and devoted all its efforts to attacking Hainan Island, the military situation in the various war zones near Guangzhou has been fluctuating. Most of the Japanese troops in the West River seemed to have been transferred to attack Hainan. Therefore, the situation above Jiujiang and Sanshui was gradually easing last month. Only 2,000 Japanese troops remained in the Sanshui River Estuary and the Southwest area. Their outposts advanced to Muxianlanggang, actively setting up defensive fortifications during the day and retreating to the Sanshui River Estuary to camp at night, knowing that their forces were weak and preventing night attacks by the Chinese guerrillas. On the Jiujiang side, the Japanese army also retreated one after another, and a part was transferred to the East River. After the Japanese infantry retreated on the 26th and 27th of last month, newly arrived Taiwanese reserve troops were transferred to fill the defense, with a strength of only 400 to 500 people. However, the defensive fortifications were more consolidated than before, with trenches dug near the defense area and machine guns and small steel cannons erected. As for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Longshan and Longjiang in Shunde, it was purely to avoid attacks by the Chinese air force, and they have now retreated to the Foshan area, relying on the air defense infantry to cover them.

### Japanese Troops in Jiangxi in a Dilemma

The Chinese army in the West River believes that the Japanese army is paying attention to the military affairs of the East River, considering it an opportunity to launch a counterattack. Recently, the troops of Guangdong and Guangxi in the West River have been redeployed, and the direction of the attack has been divided. The Deng Longguang troops in Guangdong Province have already arrived in the vicinity of Gaoyao. All of the original tax police corps of the Japanese will be under the command of Deng. The Guangxi army on the southwest bank will be led by Xia Wei. Both sides have made full preparations for the counterattack, and Deng and Xia have also met to decide on various liaison matters. Deng personally went to the front lines of Heshan, Heqing, and Haikou a few days ago to inspect the defense. Before the counterattack, the Chinese army repeatedly dispatched aircraft to bomb the rear of the Japanese army in the West River, destroying their defensive fortifications. At the end of last month, it once flew to Jiujiang and dropped seven or eight bombs on the Japanese military camp at Dagang and the Japanese military base at Bo'ai Station. The Japanese military camp and the Japanese artillery positions at Heqing were all hit by bombs, resulting in heavy losses. The position of the Japanese army in the West River has recently changed from active to passive, and they are in a dilemma.

### Chinese Army in Boluo Consolidates Defense Line

Judging from the overall war situation of the Japanese army, its movements seem to be to launch a surprise attack on the Chinese army in the East River, containing the Chinese army in the northwest river, so that the Japanese army in Hainan can find an opportunity to take advantage of the situation and invade Leizhou or Qinlian. Therefore, the military situation in Longmen and Heyuan in the East River and the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong has become slightly tense recently. Over the past week, the Japanese army in Zengcheng has invaded in two routes. One route advanced along Zhengguo Wutu to Longmen. The Japanese army in Shiqiao, Zhucun, and other places below Zengcheng has increased to more than 2,000 people, with one squadron of cavalry and one platoon of artillery. They invaded the Chinese army in Shangxia Nanhua. After suffering a setback once, they did not dare to advance further, because if they went deeper, they would be intercepted by the Chinese army in the North River. Therefore, most of the Japanese army traveled along the Zengcheng Shitan Road to spy on Boluo and Heyuan. On the 26th of last month, they advanced to Shima and fought fiercely with the Wu Qiwu troops of the Chinese army for a day and night, and used aircraft and artillery to bombard the positions of the Chinese army. The Wu troops then moved to a new position and firmly defended Sucun to defend Boluo. The Japanese army is currently blocked in Sucun and has not been able to leave Futian, because the Chinese army near Boluo has strong fortifications, and the Wu troops are also a long-fought army. It is not easy for the Japanese army to advance further without paying a heavy price.

### Japanese Side Attempts to Protect Sea Outlets

In the past ten days, the Guangzhou Japanese army has abandoned the west and moved east. There are two reasons for this. From an active perspective, the Japanese army has increased its troops to the East River, bombing Boluo, Heyuan, Longchuan, and Laolong, with the purpose of capturing Yunling, leaving Lianping, controlling the upper reaches of the East River, and further attempting to cut off the transportation routes between Fujian and Guangdong and Jiangxi and Guangdong. Therefore, Japanese warships have been hovering on the sea off Shantou and Chenghai, seemingly remotely supporting the land army invading the east. However, in reality, the East River is still easy for the Japanese army to operate along the coastline. As for the Heyuan and Xingning areas, the mountains are stacked, and it is difficult to march. Except for the air force, it is difficult for the mechanized units of the Japanese army to exert their power. Moreover, the elite troops of the Chinese side are stationed in the upper reaches of the East River, waiting for work at ease. If the Japanese army advances rashly, it will commit a great danger. From a passive perspective, the Japanese army's sudden invasion of the east is actually taking an offensive defense, because the new deployment of the Chinese army in the East River has been completed in the past month. The Japanese army in the East District is confined to Dongguan and Zengcheng, preventing the East River from being attacked by the Chinese army. Therefore, before the Chinese army launched a large-scale counterattack, it took the initiative to strike first and wanted to defeat the main force of the Chinese army, Wu Qiwu's troops, in the East River. Therefore, there was a fierce battle in Shijiao. Secondly, the Japanese army has been withdrawing from the West River from all sources, fearing that the Chinese army in the East River would intercept and encircle them. Therefore, they expanded their forward line in the East River to protect their sea outlet, Humen. If the Japanese army that recently attacked Boluo does not advance further, then the battle of Shijiao was purely for the latter.

### Jian Dao Bible Institute Relocates, Shot at During the Process, Mrs. Lin Unfortunate Victim

A correspondent from Guangxi's "New Voice" reports that the Jian Dao Bible Institute in Wuzhou, Guangxi, was founded by the Western Missionary Alliance to train young men and women preachers. Since hiring Mr. Lin Daoliang, a preacher from the Shanghai Jubilee Church, as the director of the institute, the institute's work has developed, and the number of students has also increased day by day. Recently, Wuzhou is the throat of Guangxi, located in a dangerous place. On the 15th of last month, the institute received an order from the government to relocate the institute to Longzhou. Unexpectedly, on the morning of January 16th, the teachers and students of the Jian Dao Institute were relocating when they saw Japanese planes flying in from the southwest. Although the English flag was hung high on the small steamship, the Japanese airmen still flew low and fired at the small steamship. Many students were injured, fortunately, the injuries were still light. Unfortunately, Ms. Jin Jufang, the wife of Lin Daoliang, was wounded in the abdomen by bullets, and also injured the four-month-old baby she was carrying, bleeding non-stop. After arriving at the hospital, she immediately died of exhaustion. It can be said to be tragic.

### Grain Prices Soar in Zhejiang Province, Provincial Government Encourages Procurement of Jiangxi Rice

A correspondent from Jinhua reports that eastern Zhejiang has many mountains and few fields, and has always been a rice-deficient area. This year, due to a sharp increase in population, the supply of food cannot meet the demand, resulting in soaring rice prices in various counties. The provincial government has encouraged merchants to obtain licenses and go to Jiangxi to purchase food rice in order to provide a continuous supply and avoid a shortage of food. According to an investigation by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the railway transported 17,188 tons of rice to Zhejiang in January and 11,014 tons of rice to Zhejiang from February 1st to 23rd. It is estimated that there are about 15,000 tons of rice waiting to be transported in Jiangxi. In total, the amount of rice transported from Jiangxi to Zhejiang in January and February is about 30,000 tons, equivalent to about 60 million catties, a total of 600,000 dan.

### Japanese Automobile Attacked in Baimao Estuary

A correspondent from Taicang reports that Baimao Estuary in northern Taicang, bordering Changshu, is located on the riverside and is a strategic location. A few days ago, two trucks of the Datong Automobile Company, loaded with military supplies, were learned of by the Wu Guorong unit of the Liuh River Guerrilla Force, who led their team to launch a surprise attack. The truck bodies were damaged by bullets, and the two Japanese escorts were captured alive. The military supplies used were also detained. Subsequently, a large truck full of tinfoil, driven by a Russian, was ordered to stop by the guerrillas. The Russian did not understand Chinese and drove forward, and was hit by a volley of gunfire. The cylinder was hit by a bullet and caught fire. All the tinfoil in the car was completely burned, with losses amounting to 30,000 yuan. The Russian driver was also wounded by bullets.

### Japanese Troops Attacking Cangshu, Suffered a Crushing Defeat

A correspondent from Banhu reports that the Shen and Luo units of the Chinese army, together with the people's self-defense force, led by County Magistrate Zhang Gefei, besieged the Pinghu County City. After eight days of stalemate, the Japanese troops besieged in Niuhu tightly closed the city, and steel cannons were densely arranged on the city walls, blindly bombarding outside the city. The Chinese army was not damaged, but the civilian houses outside the city were destroyed by Japanese artillery fire. The headquarters of the Chinese army was located in Xincang Town. A grand memorial service was held there on the 3rd to mourn the four patriots who bravely sacrificed their lives in the siege. Jin, the Japanese army, planned to take advantage of the Chinese army's unpreparedness and set off in a large team, detouring Xindai in an attempt to directly attack Xincang. Unexpectedly, they got lost. In Fangtu Town, north of Xindai, there were more than 300 guerrillas of the Jin unit, who suddenly surrounded the Japanese army. After three hours of fierce fighting, about 300 shops in Fangtu Town were set on fire by the Japanese army in the east and west markets. All the houses were turned into ashes, and dozens of innocent people were also surrounded by the flames and buried in the fire pit. Seeing that the guerrillas were numerous and loud, the Japanese army did not dare to love the war and fled to Jinshan.

### Education News: Guangxi Province Vigorously Implements General People's Education, Adopts the Anti-Japanese Three-Character Classic as a Teaching Material, Prints Three Million Copies to Promote Propaganda

Wang Xiangchen, deputy director of the Popular Reading Materials Group of the Teaching Materials Editing Committee of the Ministry of Education, has been working hard on the production of popular literature and art for many years. The Anti-Japanese Three-Character Classic he wrote has been very effective in arousing the anti-Japanese sentiments of the people. In addition to Wang printing 200,000 copies at his own expense to promote propaganda, the book has also been listed as one of the wartime popular series of the Ministry of Education. Wang recently received a telegram from the Guangxi Provincial Government stating that the province is vigorously implementing general wartime adult education and plans to adopt the Anti-Japanese Three-Character Classic as a teaching material, printing 3 million copies, and soliciting his consent. Wang immediately replied by telegram, willing to sacrifice his copyright and hoping to print as many copies as possible.

### Proposal from Shanghai Education Professors at the National Education Conference (3)

Please set up an education design agency and extensively solicit the entire strategy for education and nation-building, select experts, carefully study, and report to the central government within a time limit for adoption and implementation.

(Reason) During the period when the imperial examination was abolished in our country, during the Xinhai Revolution, and during the establishment of the National Government, society has undergone drastic changes, but the overall education seems to lack a planned transformation.

Education is a sharp weapon for resisting Japan and building the country. Resisting Japan and building the country requires all the people of the country to have a clear awareness, a determination to persevere, consistent action, and lasting strength. All of these cannot be achieved without education, so education must be rapidly transformed.

However, the transformation of education must start from the root. Such as emphasizing practice over theory, such as reducing vacations and shortening hands, such as revising curriculum standards, such as increasing or decreasing the duration of schools at all levels, such as teaching focusing on practice, such as training using mentors, it seems that these are still branch problems. The transformation must also have a comprehensive plan, such as restricting studying abroad, such as making good use of the Geng funds, such as ensuring education funds, such as increasing teachers' salaries, such as implementing joint examinations, such as centrally awarding degrees, such as central appointment of professors, such as improving the university course selection system, such as banning one or two bad private schools, such as expanding vocational schools, paying attention to technical training, it seems that these are still partial solutions, but to thoroughly transform education, on the one hand, we should cut off corruption, which is indeed not a means of transformation, on the other hand, we should be based on the latest education theory, the recent national conditions and the world education trends, earnestly study, and formulate an entire strategy, in order to build a new education for the country, lead the whole people, resist Japan and build the country. For example, how to establish a new Chinese education ideological system, how to determine the education goals of each stage according to our country's education goals, and then according to the education goals of each stage, further implement the minimum curriculum standards, so that education can be thoroughly Three People's Principles, how to control national education, whether in the distribution and supervision of education fees, the establishment of private schools, and the adjustment of other social or cultural institutions, so that education can fully exert its national function and penetrate into the lives of the whole people, how to establish a central normal college, specializing in research and experimentation, concentrating on teacher training, and cooperating with normal colleges in various regions, so that education theory can be further developed, and teachers can be more professional, how to concentrate the power of appointment of teachers and education administrators, and ensure their minimum living standards, how to unify and simplify the national education administration, reform the inspection system, how to organize national children and youth, not only to combine teaching and training, but also to completely integrate education with the party and government, how to add national institutions, specializing in editing and reviewing textbooks, scripts, and broadcasting scripts, and coordinating school building construction, supplying education materials, and trial-producing teaching aids, how to create simple characters, unify the national language within a time limit, and eliminate illiteracy, etc., all require comprehensive deliberation and implementation step by step, so that the general education colleagues can follow and complete the great cause of nation-building.

(Methods) Designate funds, hire education experts, and organize an education design agency attached to the Ministry of Education.

Solicit the entire strategy for education and nation-building. Organize and sort out the solicited plans within a time limit, and report to the central government for adoption.

Examine the implementation results and continue to research, investigate, design, and improve.

In particular, for the relief of out-of-school children and unemployed teachers, please the central government allocate a portion of the compulsory education, social education, or wartime relief funds, and issue an order to all schools and education institutions in the country to jointly promote street children education.

(Reason) Since the August 13th Incident, children have dropped out of school everywhere, and teachers have been unemployed. Especially in large cities such as the Shanghai Concession, there are no less than 100,000 street children. There are also many elementary school teachers who are entrusted to refugee shelters. For the country and for humanity, we cannot stand by and ignore them.

Whether in the economic, administrative, school building, or teaching aspects, the general elementary schools are not suitable for resisting Japan. It is not only increasing social waste to force children to decorate Taigu with education that is not suitable for resisting Japan, but it is actually reducing the national power to resist Japan.

Since the war of resistance, the education community has neither sought fundamental transformation nor concentrated its efforts on cooperative relief, contradicting and hesitating. There should be a rapid and positive setting up to promote the war of resistance and education at the same time.

(Methods) The central government allocates a portion of compulsory education, social education, or wartime relief funds to set up street children education everywhere in urban and rural areas, and issues an order to all schools and education institutions in the country to jointly promote it. Each school should open at least one street children education class.

All urban and rural children aged four or five to fifteen or sixteen who have not entered school must be forced to receive education, averaging about two hours per day, and completing it in half a year without paying any fees.

Street education should include the following activities, and teaching materials should be edited, distributed, and applied. (A) Hygiene, such as 1. Hygiene propaganda and family visits, 2. General inspections and clean disease inspections, 3. Employment time and special prevention.

On nutrition and clothing care.

Treatment of trachoma, tooth decay, and chronic diseases.

Training on safe actions, safe actions, and hygiene habits, etc. (B) Common sense, such as hygiene, nature, and social common sense. (C) Tools, such as speaking, writing, writing, reading, counting, etc. (D) Cooperation, such as 1. Group training, such as sports singing and games, group exercises, gatherings, street children organizations, etc., 2. Social work, such as holding various gatherings, reports, investigations, helping farming, performing dramas, singing, exhibitions, lectures, wall newspapers, communications, organizing libraries, etc.

Vocational preparation, such as choosing a career, understanding service relationships, training skills, researching cooperatives, savings plans, and guidance after graduation, etc.

Each street education class should not exceed 40 people, and each class should have one teacher. When the number of classes in various places increases, additional roving nurses, roving music, or physical education teachers and supervisors should be added.

Street children teachers should give priority to unemployed teachers after the war, and cultivate and make use of local university and middle school students and hospital doctors.

Street children teachers and office workers should go to living maintenance expenses, and university and middle school students should be given transportation expenses.

After graduating from street children in various places, they should organize the Chinese Street Children's Association and cooperate closely with local street education institutions, so that graduated street children can have continued learning, vocational guidance, and the opportunity to develop cooperative undertakings. Once the majority of street children's associations are established in various places, a national street children's federation will be established.

Establish a street education fund to research and promote street education movements in various places. (From the second to the eighth articles are based on the current methods of the Shanghai Street Children's Education Association)

Young Woman Sues for Alimony  After Living with Wang Muliang for Several Years  Abandoned After Bearing a Daughter  Wang Muliang, age 33, a shareholder of the Tongxing Steamship Company and a native of Huizhou, Anhui Province, resides at No. 28, Yiyeli, Galle Road, Rue Laguénée, in the French Concession.  He originally had a wife, Ms. Xu, but in 1933, he met Tao Guixian, a woman from Changshu (age 22 this year), and lived together, bearing a daughter.  Recently, Wang's feelings for Ms. Tao cooled, and he abandoned her.  Therefore, Tao Guixian retained lawyer Xiao Baichuan to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Wang Muliang of abandonment and attaching a civil suit.  According to the complaint, the plaintiff met the defendant in 1933 and was seduced.  They began living together in 1934, renting residences at No. 39, Yinyuli, Baxianqiao, and No. 6, Yonganli, Rue Wagner.  On December 20, 1936, a daughter was born.  The defendant asked Dr. Xi from Zhongde Hospital to deliver the baby. The girl was named Genling and is now three years old.  Initially, the defendant concealed the fact that he already had a wife, Ms. Xu.  After the plaintiff found out, it was too late.  She had to endure it.  However, the defendant treated the plaintiff fairly well until Ms. Xu came to make trouble starting in February of last year.  Afterward, the defendant gradually became distant from the plaintiff.  Starting in July, he stopped paying living expenses.  On December 13 of last year, the defendant's wife, Ms. Xu, brought a group of men and women who beat and insulted the plaintiff and took away all her clothes and belongings.  Having no choice, the plaintiff temporarily stayed with a friend.  Since then, the defendant has abandoned the plaintiff.  Now, the plaintiff is pregnant and about to give birth.  Without sufficient funds and a place to live, the situation is precarious.  She has no choice but to sue for an investigation and request an order to pay 3,000 yuan in living expenses.  Based on the complaint, the court once held a hearing to summon the defendant.  Because the defendant did not appear, the hearing was postponed.  Yesterday, Magistrate Zhang Minsheng held a hearing.  The plaintiff and her lawyer appeared.  The defendant's defense lawyer, Mao Xianshen, appeared.  After questioning both parties, the court decided to postpone the hearing for further investigation.  The defendant provided a guarantor to ensure his appearance when summoned.

Dismissed Chauffeur Steals Car Out of Resentment and Vents Spite  Sentenced to Forty Days of Detention

Mr. Aeliaas, a Westerner residing at No. 400, Haig Road in West Shanghai, owns a car worth 3,000 yuan, license plate number 10101.  On the 5th of this month, at 5 p.m., after finishing work in his office, he drove home and parked the car in the garage.  An hour later, his chauffeur suddenly discovered that the car was missing.  Initially, he thought the owner had driven it out.  However, upon going to the upper floor and seeing the owner in the room, he knew the car must have been stolen.  He immediately inquired with the gatekeeper, who said he had seen someone driving the car rapidly south on Rue Say Zoong.  Mr. Aeliaas immediately telegraphed the Jing'an Temple Police Station to notify all police stations to investigate.  On the night of the 7th, at 8 p.m., the car was found near the intersection of Avenue Road and Rue de Warend.  The French police station, upon receiving the report, notified the Jing'an Temple Police Station to send a detective and the owner to identify the car.  It was confirmed to be the original car.  However, upon inspecting the entire car, the gasoline tank cap and another part were missing.  The rest was intact.  The motive of the thief is unknown and is subject to conjecture.  After careful investigation by Chinese and Western detectives, Zhao Miaogen, a local, a recently dismissed chauffeur of a German friend of the owner, was suspected.  He was immediately arrested and confessed under interrogation.  Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court.  Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted Zhao according to the law, stating the facts of the case and requesting a trial.  Magistrate Dai Rongduo conducted the interrogation.  Zhao confessed that he stole the car purely to vent his anger.  He had been dismissed by his employer for lending the employer's car to the plaintiff for three days, which led to his dismissal.  He was filled with resentment and stole the car and abandoned it.  He also admitted to damaging the gasoline tank cap and discarding it, but denied damaging anything else.  After hearing the case, the court immediately announced the verdict: Zhao Miaogen was sentenced to 40 days of detention.  If he converts it to a fine, it would be two yuan per day.  The defendant expressed his acceptance of the sentence in court and was immediately taken into custody.

Woman Dies from Abortion  Female Doctor Zhu Wenfang Sent to Court for Trial

Ms. Liu Xu, a married woman from Wuxi (age 33), residing at No. 94, Dagu Road, whose husband, Liu Qingxiang, works in a certain place and does not earn much.  She has five children, boys and girls.  Ms. Liu recently became pregnant again, about two months along.  She felt burdened by having too many children and secretly went to the Wenfang Obstetrics Hospital at No. 18, Lane 713, Rue Gordon, founded by Zhu Wenfang (age 40), a woman from Hubei, on the 2nd of this month. She wanted to have an abortion.  Zhu Wenfang asked for 15 yuan, which Ms. Liu agreed to pay.  Zhu provided her with a bottle of pills, twelve in total, and a piece of gauze soaked in medicine, instructing Ms. Liu to take the pills and insert the gauze into her vagina to induce an abortion.  Ms. Liu took the pills and gauze home and followed the instructions.  However, after two days and nights, the fetus did not abort.  She went to Zhu Wenfang's place again and took four more pills, which were still ineffective.  On the evening of the 6th, at 10:30 p.m., Ms. Liu's face turned pale, and her condition deteriorated significantly.  Her husband, Liu Qingxiang, hired a car to take her to Zhongde Hospital on Avenue Foch.  She died at the hospital at 10:40 a.m. the next morning.  Liu Qingxiang reported the incident to the Gordon Road Police Station.  Detectives Zhu Mengqi and Xia Shutang rushed to arrest Zhu Wenfang and brought her and the pills and gauze back to the police station. Zhu Wenfang was transferred to the women's prison.  Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special Court.  Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and requested that Zhu be detained, stating that Liu Xu's body had been sent to the morgue for an autopsy and requesting a postponement.  He presented the pills and gauze as evidence.  Liu Qingxiang stated that his wife had gone to the obstetrics hospital for an abortion, but he was unaware of it at the time and only found out the next day.  Zhu Wenfang's testimony was evasive.  Magistrate Jiang Shuzi ordered that she be remanded in custody and the hearing postponed for seven days.

Vietnamese Police Officer Commits Suicide by Shooting Himself

A certain Vietnamese police officer, No. 142, from the Avenue Joffre Police Station in the French Concession, who had been working for many years, lived with his family in Room 2, Company Housing, behind the Avenue Joffre Police Station.  Recently, for some unknown reason, he had a sudden impulse and took his own life.  At 7:30 p.m. on the 7th, in his room, he pointed his duty rifle at his throat, pressed the trigger with his right big toe, and fired.  The bullet entered through his throat, pierced his brain, and exited through the top of his head.  Brain matter and blood splattered everywhere.  His family heard the noise and immediately sent him to the hospital, but it was too late to save him.  After the authorities of the French Concession sent personnel to the scene to examine the body yesterday, the family prepared the body for burial.

Watching a Fire  Nearly Falls to His Death  Tenant Injured by Fire

Last night, at around 8 p.m., a fire broke out in the attic of No. 487, Dongsiwenli, Xinzha Road, in the Public Concession, caused by a tipped-over kerosene stove.

Shen Suping, the Third Section Chief of the Pseudo-County Government of Jiashan, was the only pro-Japanese element in Jiashan. He would always take the stage to speak at anti-Chiang and anti-communist rallies, using extremely inflammatory language. This time, he was shot by patriotic patriots on the road at Jiashan Station. The bullet entered through his abdomen. He immediately took a car to Fumin Hospital in Shanghai for treatment and underwent surgery. It is now known that he died yesterday morning from testicular inflammation. At the same time, his close confidant, Zhao Ronggen, who was the first chairman of the Jiashan Maintenance Association, was captured alive and beheaded by the guerrilla team in Yangmiao, Jiashan. The people's hearts were greatly pleased. Such is the fate of traitors.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Weekly  Housing Special Page  Chairman Chiang's Residence  Water Bird
People filled with feudal ideas generally believe that Chairman Chiang's residence must be magnificent and like a palace. In fact, he lives in this era, bearing enormous and arduous responsibilities. He is rarely in one place for long, so he does not have the leisurely enjoyment that people imagine. He constantly inspects various places and goes to the front lines during wartime. In such an unstable life, he cannot hide in an ivory tower to pursue the beauty of his residence. He often borrows other people's residences as temporary quarters. For example, when he was in Hankou, he borrowed Yang Sen's mansion in Yihua Village outside Hankou; when he was in Chengdu, he borrowed Liu Wenhui's mansion; and in Nanjing, his residence in his hometown also used old buildings with slight modifications. In Linchuan (Fuzhou), Jiangxi, for the convenience of long-term encirclement and suppression of the Red Army, he built a square, large flat house on the west end of an empty field in Linchuan Middle School. The form of this house is slightly different from ordinary houses, with square corners and very high. There are many windows, and each room is connected. It is said that Chairman Chiang designed it himself. He said that after the war, it could be assigned to the middle school for use. I don't know if it is still intact now. The furnishings inside are also very simple. In the bedroom, two beds are placed side by side, and several commemorative photos and couplets of Chairman Chiang and his wife are hung on the surrounding walls. The bedroom is slightly elevated, and the next room is the bathroom. In his office, the writing desk is very large, and the file cabinets behind it have each drawer marked with the type of item. This is a good place for thinking. The middle of the house is the reception room, and detailed military maps are hung on the two walls. These furnishings are the same in Chairman Chiang's residences everywhere. Only in his hometown of Xikou, in the residence converted from Wenchang Pavilion, there are many more commemorative photos. Upon entering the gate, you can see an enlarged photo of Chairman Chiang standing beside Madam Wang. In the Nanjing residence, there is also a carpet embroidered with a map of the Republic of China, which is placed in the large living room. It is very novel and precious and has a profound meaning!

Records of Village Life  Sorrowful Departure  Ai Li
After the success of the Xinhai Revolution, I returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou with my husband, Liu San, and lived in seclusion in the countryside, growing vegetables behind closed doors. Sometimes I grew orchids and planted chrysanthemums. My late father loved chrysanthemums, my husband loved orchids, and I loved monthly roses. Every morning after breakfast, we would enter the small garden together to tend to the flowers. Cymbidium orchids prefer sunlight. If the weather is sunny and the sunlight is not strong, we would move the potted plants to a sunny place for a while. The soil must be moist but not dry for the flowers to flourish. The seven-petal variety, with petals resembling plums and lotus flowers, is the best. The variety with white petals and a wrapped heart is a special variety, followed by the pure-hearted variety. Others are not worth mentioning. When the flowers bloom, I inhale their fragrance, as if encountering a recluse in a long-deserted empty mountain. Although we are speechless, we forget ourselves. My husband said that wine can make people distant, and so can this flower. Monthly roses are a famous product of Yangzhou. I bought them at a high price. There are three colors: light red, tender yellow, and white. I love their bright colors and strong fragrance. I am content to be with them all day long. The fragrance of this flower is quite strong, so Shanghai people call it the "perfume flower." However, it does not live long. Although I take great care of it, it gradually withered after three years. I regret it very much, probably because the soil is not good. There are many types of chrysanthemums, too numerous to list. The green lotus, golden belt, and jade belt are also top-grade. In the spring, we pick the tender shoots and plant them in chrysanthemum beds. After they take root, we transplant them into pots. In the autumn, we must remove the side branches and flower buds to make the flowers large and beautiful. I remember at that time, the whole family was content, spending idle years, hardly knowing that there were still worries in the world. That year happened to be my late father's seventieth birthday. In September, we offered him countless toasts for his birthday. Mr. Zhu Zhenzhuang wrote two poems for his birthday, which included the lines "Serving parents, I made a plan to escape fame, I heard of a ban on drinking with guests, White hair offers countless toasts, Yellow flowers bloom around the house." At that time, many friends gave poems and paintings, but now they have all been looted. My husband's drinking friends, such as Zhong Haihang, Lu Gengcun, Huang Saihong, and Yao Yuanchu, all came to my humble house to drink for a long night, reveling until dawn. I fulfilled the duties of a hostess, serving warm wine. Because the servants were asleep late at night, I sometimes joined in the fun and drank a few cups. When the rooster crowed, the host and guests were all drunk. Thinking about it now, it is truly a case of "a good gathering is not always, and a grand banquet is hard to have again."

Various Aspects of Boarding Houses and the Sculpting of Isolated Island Landlords  Shen Xishen
The hotel industry in Shanghai has always been very developed, and it feels even more prosperous today, after August 13th. This, of course, is the reason that people from various places come to seek refuge. Because finding a house is very difficult on this isolated island, where land is expensive and houses are scarce, many middle- and upper-class refugees take hotels as temporary shelters, and some open rooms for long-term residence. Therefore, almost every room in every hotel is occupied by lodgers every day. The hotel door often hangs a sign saying "full," which is really a busy and unprecedented scene.
There are also many special travelers who open rooms for recreation. They are not only free but also rich, so they are most welcome by the waiters in the hotel. If the partners are complete, they may as well play a few rounds of mahjong, and when they are in high spirits, they may call a few female guides to talk. Their lives are really leisurely!
Living in a hotel is indeed very comfortable, especially in a high-end hotel, such as a restaurant or apartment, where the equipment is so complete. There are fans in summer and water heaters in winter. It is warm as spring all year round. When the electric bell is pressed, the waiter rushes to meet you. Being in it, there is a sense of joy that one does not want to go home! But there is a prerequisite, that is, there must be enough legal currency. Otherwise, if the money is exhausted, and the hotel owner issues an eviction order, it will make you laugh or cry!
After 9 p.m. every night, it is the most lively time in the hotel. All kinds of travelers are active at this time. The sound of cards is loud, and the Beijing tune is melodious. It is really a short good night! In the morning, it is quiet enough to hear a pin drop, because the travelers are having a good dream at this time!

The Deformed Development of Landlords and Tenants  Yi Zhi
The isolated island is crowded with people, and the problem of housing becomes serious. At the same time, those who are second landlords are very lucky. Everyone hopes to be a second landlord and make a fortune in this opportunity. So, a small house is rented from A to B, B sublets it to C, C sublets it to D..., making use of each other and making money from each other. So, A is a second landlord, B is also a second landlord, and C and D are also second landlords. Therefore, "second landlord" has become one of the "isolated island local products".
However, in addition to the second landlord, there are also "third landlord", "fourth landlord" and so on. Believe it or not.
My neighbor is a rice shop. The second landlord of the rice shop is the noodle shop next door. The back hall, front building, back building, pavilion building, second floor and third floor of the rice shop are all for rent. However, the third lodger on the back building and the third floor sublet a part to two single men. Are these two third tenants of the rice shop not turning into "third landlords"? And those two single men have become the "fourth tenants" in the rice shop. What is especially interesting is that the "fourth tenant" who lives on the second floor sublets half of his bed to a fortune teller. In this way, the "fourth tenant" who lives on the second floor has become the "fourth landlord", and isn't the fortune teller a "fifth tenant"? If the bed of that "fourth landlord" is very big, then, I think that fortune teller can sublet a quarter to another person, and he can be the "fifth landlord".
Originally, the Taoist thing was not known to outsiders, because the dispute over the "room rent" one morning exposed the "secret".
Then, we can guess that if the housing problem is not completely solved, there will be more troublesome and complicated disputes in the future. Because in the near future - maybe in front of you, the dispute about rent is not only about the landlord and the second landlord, but also about the second landlord and the third tenant, but also the third landlord and the fourth tenant, the fourth landlord and the fifth tenant, and even the fifth landlord and the sixth tenant, the sixth landlord and the seventh tenant.
Is this a good phenomenon?

Difficult to Find a House  Qiu Lang
My friend Yu, he is a small clerk in a company, and his monthly income is also very limited. It is already difficult to make ends meet, let alone in today's extraordinary period. Various companies and shops are implementing austerity policies, and laying off employees and reducing salaries is nothing. Although Yu is lucky enough not to be laid off, it is naturally difficult to escape the reduction of salary! His family originally lived in Zhabei. After the war broke out, he hurriedly took refuge in the Qi family in the Public Concession. Not long after, a Wuyi fellow villager came to the Qi family. His temperament was very violent, and they even quarreled, overwhelming the host, and issued an eviction order to him! He told me the other day that he has been working hard to find a house recently, but it is still difficult to find a house that he can afford the rent. He first had a feeling of laughter and tears! Although I deeply sympathize with him, I can't help him, and I just shout helplessly. I wrote a song to record it. I think there are not a few people on the isolated island who feel the same pain as my friend. The song says:
Where to find a house? South of the bridge and north of the creek, running around hard every day, competing everywhere, "clothing and food" and "housing and transportation", the word "housing" is the most important, reducing food and saving clothes, how can you sleep in the open? You came from Zhabei, and ran to the Qi family in a mess, you let a house, but you met a vicious snake, and you were actually evicted! The center suddenly trembled, entrusting people and searching for yourself, it is always difficult to predict the residence, getting along is like pins and needles, the wife is angry and the children cry, the isolated island is an expensive place, and the city of Shanghai has been known for its extravagance since ancient times. Moreover, today, the victims are full of pits and valleys. Alas, the owners of real estate, unpredictable, don’t understand to save compatriots, and arbitrarily demand, the weather is cold and the year is coming to an end, who sympathizes with this poor situation? Not to mention no meat to eat, first feel no house to live in, Du Ren's words are worth reading, how can we get thousands of wide houses, and all the poor scholars in the world will be blessed.

How to Avoid Fire Disasters  Xin Liang
Every year, countless fires are caused by the carelessness of some people. Therefore, the entire United States held a large-scale Fire Prevention Week between October 9 and 15 last year. The purpose is to call on everyone, regardless of men, women, old and young, to pay attention. At that time, a specialist was sent to each family to inspect for a week and explain various fire prevention methods to the people. The Idna Company also published the following set of questions as a general fire prevention policy for families.
In the bedroom: (1) Does anyone smoke in bed? (2) Are there matches? If so, please see if they are in a safe place. (3) If a fire suddenly breaks out at night, is there a door that can be used to easily go outside from the bedroom? This passage should not be blocked by other things.
In the bathroom: (1) Are portable electric stoves and gas stoves placed next to clothes, towels, and other flammable materials?
In the kitchen: (1) Matches must be placed in the safest box, otherwise, they are very easy to cause a fire. (2) Is the stove placed close to

### Roosevelt Declares Neutrality Law Does Not Aid Peace; Stimson Advocates Aiding Britain and France to Curb Aggressive Ambitions of Dictatorial Nations

(Washington) President Roosevelt stated to journalists today that the Neutrality Law does not contribute to peace and, in fact, encourages certain countries to threaten war. When asked if he favored repealing the Neutrality Law, the President declined to elaborate, stating that the issue was not currently under discussion. (Reuters, 7th)

(Washington) President Roosevelt officially stated today, "I believe that under the Neutrality Law, the United States' influence on peace is less strong than it would be without this law." When asked about the impact of the Neutrality Law on the Sino-Japanese War and the Spanish Civil War, the President replied that he could not comment on specific situations. (Associated Press, 7th)

(New York) Former Secretary of State Stimson sent a letter to the New York Times, advocating that the United States Navy should take action if fascist countries invade Britain and France. He stated that fascist countries could attack Britain and France with force at any time. Based on current impressions, such an attack would be a joint effort by the three fascist powers. To defend against this joint action in Europe and Asia, it is necessary for the navies of the three major democratic countries – Britain, France, and the United States – to act together. If any of these three countries attempts to remain aloof, the result will be mutual devastation. Conversely, if the fascist powers realize that the three major democratic countries have such a joint action plan, they will not dare to initiate hostilities lightly. Today, the aggressive bloc is stronger than Britain and France in terms of air and land forces. Furthermore, their substantial navy restrains the British and French fleets in European waters, while threatening the entire Western Pacific, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Singapore, the linchpin for protecting these areas, with the powerful Japanese navy. If France, Britain, or the Netherlands are threatened or destroyed, they would inevitably cede some territories in the Western Hemisphere or the East to the fascist powers, or make concessions to the fascist powers that would further endanger the security of the United States. Is this not something to be expected? Can we stand idly by and watch such a situation develop, while vainly hoping to improve our own position? Today, the iron fist of Germany is even more evident than it was in the years before the European War. Is today the time for the United States to forget the lessons of the past? The New York Times editorial supported Stimson's proposal, stating that this policy of the United States does not require overseas alliances, but only requires prudent consultation with other law-abiding nations on self-defense strategies. (Reuters, 7th)

(New York) The New York Times published a letter from former Secretary of State Stimson yesterday, and the New York People's Forum newspaper has now responded with alarm. To what extent do the democratic countries share the same views? What is the relationship between the United States and the dictatorial countries? All Europeans only need to read Stimson's letter to understand. Stimson's proposal that the United States should declare in advance that it will assist the democratic countries with military force once they are attacked is logical and understands reality. It is fortunate that President Roosevelt's national defense build-up plan is sufficient to prevent war. If the United States backs the democratic countries with its strength, the totalitarian countries will have no hope of winning and will inevitably retreat in the face of difficulty. (Havas, 8th)

(Washington) Former Secretary of State Stimson's letter, published in the New York Times yesterday, has been commented on by diplomatic circles here, stating that this letter, if effective, can clarify the conflicting opinions of the two factions in the United States regarding foreign policy, namely the isolationists and those who support President Roosevelt's current policies, so its significance is extremely important. U.S. government officials said that the reason why the European situation is tending towards relaxation is partly because President Roosevelt has adopted a firm attitude, and partly because the United States has sold aircraft to Britain and France. It is hoped that the United States will maintain these two measures and, when necessary, intensify its efforts in accordance with the guidelines suggested by Stimson. U.S. business leaders said that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy of appeasement is sufficient to avoid war, and the United States should not interfere in European affairs. However, the majority of American public opinion wants the government to continue to be vigilant and not be taken advantage of by events. (Havas, 8th)

### U.S. Sends Envoy to Celebrate Papal Coronation; Creates New Diplomatic Precedent

(Washington) President Roosevelt's decision to send U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy, to Rome to celebrate the coronation of Pope Pius XII has surprised political circles here. In the past, the United States had no diplomatic relations with the Vatican and had never sent a special envoy to celebrate a papal coronation. It is widely believed that Roosevelt's resolute decision to create a new precedent is intended to strengthen his anti-fascist policy and strength, and to indicate that times have changed, and American diplomacy does not need to adhere to old conventions and can explore new paths. (Haitong, 8th)

Dublin: De Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Republic (who is Catholic), went to Rome this evening to celebrate the coronation of Pope Pius XII. The Republic's Foreign Minister, Walsh, accompanied him. (Havas, 7th)

### U.S. Military Expansion Bill Passed by Senate; Most of President's Defense Plan Can Be Implemented

(Washington) The Senate today passed the government's proposed $360,000,000 army expansion bill by a large majority. The bill is now referred to a joint conference of the Senate and House of Representatives to resolve some differences, such as the Senate approving 6,000 army aircraft, while the House of Representatives limited it to 5,500, and the air force budget was limited to $300,000,000. It has now been agreed that the profits of aircraft manufacturers, etc., are limited to 10%. Once this bill is enacted, most of President Roosevelt's $550,000,000 defense plan will be implemented. (Reuters, 7th)

(Washington) Regarding the air force expansion bill, after the Senate yesterday passed an amendment to increase the total number of U.S. Army aircraft to 6,000 (the original bill passed by the House of Representatives proposed to increase the total number of Army aircraft to 5,500), today it passed the entire bill by a vote of 77 to 8, with a total cost of $358,000,000. Prior to this, an additional clause was passed, proposing to use $300,000,000 for the air force, with the allocation as follows: (1) $170,000,000 for ordering aircraft; (2) $130,000,000 for purchasing bombs, increasing the number of air force personnel, paying salaries, and researching aviation technology. The remaining $58,000,000 will be used to adjust the existing equipment of various factories to meet military needs, and to strengthen the defenses of the Panama Canal Zone, especially air defense and coastal defense. As the bill passed by the Senate is broader in scope than the one passed by the House of Representatives, a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives will be formed to discuss and find a compromise solution. (Havas, 7th)

### Shift in American Public Opinion

(New York) Indiana Democratic Congressman Louis Ludlow introduced a constitutional amendment to the House of Representatives in 1936, advocating abolishing the President's power to declare war and changing it to a decision by public referendum. The House of Representatives then decided that this bill did not need to be discussed. Now, twelve senators have also introduced similar bills, which have not yet been submitted for discussion. The American Institute of Public Opinion, in order to gauge the direction of public opinion, conducted a public opinion survey. The results have now been announced. Here is a comparison with the results of the four surveys conducted in 1936, 1937, 1938 and 1939:

The rise and fall of support for abolishing the President's power to declare war can be seen from this. (Havas, 7th)

### U.S. Chief of Naval Operations States: Not Worried About Japanese Competition; Will Maintain 5-5-3 Ratio; Naval and Army Forces to Conduct Exercises Next Month

(Washington) According to Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Leahy, speaking to reporters today, if Japan implements its plan to compete with the British and American fleets, the United States will also build more warships to maintain the 5-5-3 ratio. The Philippines may become independent in 1946, and the United States will then have no obligation to defend the island. After visiting the New York World's Fair, the U.S. fleet will return to the Pacific in early July. The U.S. Navy's review in the Caribbean and South Atlantic was quite successful. The U.S. fleet is sufficient to compete with any country's fleet. (Associated Press, 7th)

(Washington) Chief of Naval Operations Leahy roughly disclosed the results of the U.S. Navy's exercises in the Caribbean, stating that several of the attacking force's destroyers and submarines had penetrated deep into San Juan, Puerto Rico, and a certain location northeast of Haiti, but the attacking force's transport ships did not enter within range of U.S. fire. (Reuters, 7th)

(Washington) U.S. Army and Navy personnel stated today that the Army and Navy will conduct joint exercises in mid-April, with the aim of repelling enemy invasions of the Atlantic coast. (Reuters, 8th)

### Canadian Prime Minister Expresses Relief at Calmer European Situation

Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister King stated in the House of Commons today that the news from Europe six weeks ago was extremely serious, so he invited Conservative Party leader Manion for a talk, informing him of events that could not be announced to Parliament. Since then, although the seriousness of the information has diminished slightly, it was still enough to worry the government. Until recently, in the past day or two, he could happily say that the prospects seemed to have become much clearer. (Reuters, 8th)

### British Trade Minister to Visit the United States After Visiting Germany and Russia

(Berlin) Overseas Trade Minister Hudson is scheduled to visit Berlin and Moscow this month. After returning home, he will represent the British government and travel to the United States to attend the opening ceremony of the New York World's Fair (on the 30th of next month). He may take the opportunity to meet with U.S. authorities and exchange views on the implementation of the Anglo-American trade agreement (concluded in November last year), and then return home via Canada. (Havas, 8th)

(London) During the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, Business Secretary Stanley stated that when he visits Germany this month, he will conduct negotiations with German government authorities on various issues related to Anglo-German trade, but he does not intend to involve political issues, nor does he intend to grant Germany short-term credit loans. (Havas, 7th)

### Great Mathematician Passes Away

Munich: World-renowned mathematician Professor Lindemann of Germany passed away at his private residence in Munich on the 6th of this month, at the age of 87. Lindemann initiated the debate on squaring the circle in 1882. Lindemann was the first person to prove that squaring the circle is impossible. During his lifetime, the Prussian Academy of Sciences awarded him the prestigious Steele Prize. (Haitong, 8th)

### Britain Reveals Propaganda Policy; Subsidizes Reuters for Telegrams During Tense European Situation

(London) The House of Commons discussed the Foreign Office's budget proposal today, totaling £259,087. Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler gave a speech to explain, stating, "After the outbreak of war in Shanghai on August 13, 1937, the British naval authorities there, together with the British Consul-General and the local relief committee, handled the evacuation of British women and children. From August 17th to 24th, a total of 3,800 women and children were sent to Hong Kong on six chartered transport ships, at a total cost of £8,000. In addition, 2,300 women and children left Shanghai at their own expense. Furthermore, during the tense Czech situation in September last year, the government allocated a large sum of money to Reuters News Agency, entrusting it to broadcast news to the world daily through radio stations in Leafield and Rugby. If the House of Commons knew that a certain Austrian news agency was sending out about 20,000 words of news every day, it would understand the value of this subsidy." The members then passed the original bill by a show of hands. (Havas, 7th)

(London) Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha presented the Army budget proposal for the next fiscal year (1939-1940) to the House of Commons, totaling £161,133,000, and explained that Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a statement on the 6th of last month stating that Britain and France maintain a joint relationship, and if France is attacked without provocation, Britain will support it with all its forces. Therefore, the British Army must prepare everything to be able to travel to the European continent and participate in the war when necessary. As for the goal of talks between the British and French general staffs, it is limited to formulating a joint defense plan and has no aggressive intent. But since the general trend is such, we must rectify our military equipment so that all troops receive sufficient supplies, and we must especially pay attention to our own defense to ensure the safety of our people.
