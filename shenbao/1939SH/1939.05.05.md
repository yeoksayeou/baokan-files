Editorial

### Litvinov's Dismissal and England

The international situation is turbulent, and all parties are intricate, not knowing where to go. Only the strength of England and the Soviet Union stands out as a crucial factor in influencing the overall situation. The ongoing negotiations between the two countries are the catalyst among these factors. Representing the Soviet Union and responsible for the negotiations was the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov. The success or failure of the negotiations, the joy or sorrow of the two powers, the totalitarian countries watch with sideways glances, and the democratic countries listen intently. However, news suddenly arrived that Litvinov had been dismissed. The Supreme Soviet approved it without hesitation. The vacancy was not filled by Deputy Commissar Potemkin but was concurrently held by the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Molotov. This sudden event shocked the world. The Soviet Union not only showed no signs beforehand but also made a decisive decision on the spot. Soviet politics indeed has a unique style and is a creation in world political history. It is said to be mysterious, but it is a manifestation of its revolutionary nature and the atmosphere of a new country!

Litvinov, over sixty years old, is a loyal follower of Bolshevism. He dedicated himself to the revolution during the Tsarist era. After the success of the revolution, he served as a member of the Central Executive Committee and engaged in foreign affairs. In 1925, when People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Chicherin retired, Litvinov succeeded him, holding the position until now, spanning fourteen years. The Soviet Union went from being isolated to becoming an important force on the world stage, from being the target of public criticism to becoming a country of hope. This was not achieved by one person or one event, but in terms of diplomacy, Litvinov played a leading role. It was not merely due to his position or opportunity, but his outstanding talent was truly unmatched. Summarizing his achievements: in addition to dedicating himself to the country, eliminating the jealousy of other countries, and gaining the recognition of other countries, he contributed greatly to the international community. Joining the League of Nations and changing its atmosphere, first; formulating the Kellogg-Briand Pact, second; advocating the collective security system, third; making a clear definition of aggressor states, fourth; advocating disarmament, fifth; concluding non-aggression pacts with many countries, sixth; and forming an alliance with France to stabilize the European situation, seventh. No contemporary diplomat can compare with Litvinov in terms of words and deeds. Now, his sudden dismissal must have its internal causes in the Soviet Union, but it is impossible not to deeply regret it internationally.

The reasons for Litvinov's dismissal have not been publicly stated by the Soviet authorities; claiming illness is not a convincing excuse. In November 1937, when Europe was dissatisfied with the Soviet Union, and as a result, some people were disgusted with Litvinov, it was rumored that Litvinov would be leaving his post due to suspicion in a party case. Later facts refuted the falsehood of this claim, and his current dismissal must also be unrelated to this. Then what is the reason for his sudden dismissal? Some point to this as a precursor to a change in Soviet foreign policy. Foreign policy is a part of a country's main national policy. All countries with a regular course will never easily change their foreign policy. To say that the Soviet Union will undergo drastic changes in today's turbulent international situation is unbelievable. Soviet national policy is more resolute than any other country because of its unique nation-building characteristics. Foreign policy is tied to the central core of the country and not to diplomats; therefore, its diplomatic achievements can be attributed to Litvinov's talent, but its diplomatic policies do not shift with Litvinov's changes. To say that Litvinov's dismissal is due to a change in policy is also unbelievable. Moreover, the Soviet Union's current diplomacy, in terms of its main objectives, seeks security and peace. In terms of policy, it opposes aggression as its backbone and considers totalitarian countries its strongest enemies. The alliance with France two years ago was based on this objective. Now that England has abandoned its conservative prejudices and condescends to approach the Soviet Union, it is a miracle of the international community and a success of the Soviet Union. It almost has the appearance of holding the ear of Europe. To say that it will abandon its previous achievements, change its policies, sever ties with England and France, and engage with Germany and Italy is even more unbelievable, indeed absolutely unbelievable.

Some point to this as a political storm in the Soviet Union's internal affairs, a factional struggle. These kinds of bureaucratic political theories and concepts are not applicable to the Soviet Union, so they are unbelievable. The so-called purification work within the Soviet Union has been repeatedly declared successful and stopped, so how can there be any aftereffects? Therefore, it is also unbelievable. Taking a step back, even if something happened, wouldn't there be a more appropriate time? Why sacrifice first-class diplomatic talent at a time when diplomatic negotiations are extremely difficult? This is also absolutely unbelievable.

From our perspective, Litvinov's dismissal is not related to the Soviet Union's fundamental policies, and the reason still lies in diplomacy. Soviet diplomacy mainly has three aspects: towards the Far East, towards Central and Eastern Europe, and towards France and England. Towards the Far East, it is important but not acute today; moreover, the core of its importance is not in so-called diplomacy; therefore, Litvinov was dismissed for diplomacy, but not for the Far East. Towards Central and Eastern Europe, it is not with Germany and Italy that diplomacy is the core. In addition, Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin is visiting internationally, his mission is not yet complete, and he is awaiting orders, so there is no merit or demerit to speak of; therefore, Litvinov was dismissed for diplomacy, but also not for Central and Eastern Europe. Towards France, there is an alliance to rely on, and the relationship between France and the Soviet Union can be said to be harmonious. The focus of the problem is not between England and the Soviet Union! Since England and the Soviet Union began negotiations, the world has said that the Soviet Union's collective security policy will match the organization of England's anti-aggression group in perfect harmony. Unexpectedly, after more than ten days, it has remained detached and has made no progress. The Soviet Union has never made any explanations or publicity about this; and the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary's answers to questions from members of Parliament are evasive, and they each have unspeakable secrets. The crux of the matter is not something that outsiders can understand; just as Litvinov's dismissal is incomprehensible to all parties. Two negatives make a positive, and they may not be able to enlighten each other! Looking at the various reports, the Soviet Union has a lot of unpleasant feelings towards British-style diplomacy, but it is only a trivial matter. However, the organization of the British anti-aggression group disregards the Far East; it demands that the Soviet Union bear a heavy responsibility on the western border, but Britain is stingy with promises of mutual assistance for the possible dangers that the Soviet Union may face in the Far East; this is probably what makes the Soviet Union feel greatly unhappy. Britain generously gave guarantees to Poland, Romania, and other countries in advance, and then asked the Soviet Union to follow suit. The objective result seems to be shifting part or all of the responsibility for guarantees to the Soviet Union; not only that, but Poland and other countries, after receiving British guarantees, on the one hand, have expectations of the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, still have fears of the Soviet Union; Britain has not only failed to guide the countries it guarantees well, making them treat the Soviet Union with sincerity, but also recognizes the existence of the gap between them and favors them; this is probably what makes the Soviet Union feel greatly unhappy. This kind of British-style cleverness can certainly be compromised by Litvinov, but it may not be tolerated by the Soviet Union's highest institution. Litvinov is a diplomat and has the breadth and style of a diplomat, but the Soviet Union's highest institution is a representative of a revolutionary new country. Therefore, although the two countries' foreign policies have different paths but the same destination, the Soviet Union's highest institution probably believes that Litvinov's method is not enough to prompt the clever England to reach the other shore as soon as possible. To spur it on and correct it, the only way is to take drastic measures, and thus Litvinov was dismissed!

All of these observations are what we believe to be practical, and we hope that future facts will corroborate them. As for the reasons for Litvinov's dismissal, no one in the world can understand it except for the Soviet central authority. Only the British Prime Minister Chamberlain must be able to understand it implicitly. Litvinov's dismissal has shocked the world, and Chamberlain and others must be the most shocked. This may be what England is unwilling to admit, but what the reporter wants to assert.

(Chengdu) According to information from the Sichuan Provincial Air Defense Headquarters, 27 Japanese planes infiltrated Sichuan province via the Sichuan-Hubei border at 6 PM on the 4th, attempting to raid Chongqing via Beipei. Chinese Shenying (Divine Eagle) aircraft took off and engaged them in combat over Beipei. Some Japanese planes took advantage of the situation to infiltrate and drop bombs over Chongqing city, then quickly fled. (4th Dispatch)

(Chongqing) When Japanese planes raided Chongqing at 5 PM on the 4th, the Central News Agency building took a direct hit and was destroyed. One or two employees were buried and are currently being excavated. (4th Dispatch)

(Chongqing) Chongqing Air Defense Headquarters received a telegram from Yichang at 3:40 PM on the 4th stating that 36 Japanese planes were spotted flying west in the northern part of the county. At 5:05 PM, 27 Japanese planes were spotted flying north from the east in Xingshan county. At 5:21 PM, a loud plane noise was heard in Wuxi, flying north from the south.

After dropping the bombs, the Japanese planes fled along the river. The all-clear was sounded around 6 PM. The Air Defense Department is currently supervising the defense corps to do their best to rescue the affected areas. Details of casualties are still being investigated. Japanese planes have been bombing commercial and residential areas for days, and dropping many incendiary bombs, resulting in the destruction of many shops and civilian houses, and the tragic deaths of many civilians, women and children. This cruel behavior is unprecedented. The massacre of Chinese civilians has increased the sense of shared hatred and strengthened their determination to resist aggression. (4th Dispatch)

(Chongqing) Japanese planes again raided Chongqing this afternoon, with losses almost as severe as yesterday. Japanese planes hit an important wireless radio station in Chongqing, so news about Chongqing was virtually cut off from the outside world for several hours. It is understood that the Central News Agency and the International Wireless Radio Station were bombed. The wireless radio station immediately ceased broadcasting, and telephone service was also interrupted. It is determined that 29 Japanese planes participated in the air raid, which lasted from 5 PM to 6 PM. At that time, the city was completely darkened to prevent air raids, and the entire city became a world of darkness. The bombs dropped by the Japanese planes were explosive and incendiary, so several places in the city caught fire. Fortunately, firefighters fought fiercely to prevent the fire from spreading. According to earlier reports, the Central News Agency was bombed, but only a few coolies were injured. According to the Air Defense Headquarters, a total of 29 Japanese bombers attacked. After receiving the report of the Japanese planes' arrival, the Air Defense Headquarters immediately dispatched fighter planes to intercept them downstream, resulting in a fierce air battle. However, the Japanese planes were greater in number, so some flew to Chongqing to drop bombs. (4th, Associated Press Dispatch)

(Shantou) It's a coincidence that British Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, just arrived here when eight Japanese planes bombed Shantou this morning. The Japanese planes dropped bombs near Heiju (Black Orange), and it is believed their target was a rice storage warehouse. There were many casualties, but the exact number is unknown. Two other cities in Guangdong province were also bombed, one being Chaozhou, 20 miles north of Shantou, and the other being Jieyang, 25 miles northwest of Shantou.

(3rd Dispatch)

### Another Japanese Plane Shot Down Yesterday

(Chongqing) Chongqing was again attacked by Japanese planes today. According to unofficial estimates, the number of casualties is between 800 and 1,000. According to official announcements, a total of 36 Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing today, flying in two batches of 18 each, dropping bombs in ten locations. One Japanese bomber was reportedly shot down. It was also said that the Japanese planes' target was apparently a certain military organization that had been relocated long ago, but due to inaccurate bombing, most bombs landed in surrounding civilian houses, causing hundreds of civilian casualties. Tonight, Chongqing presents an unusual scene. Half of the city is completely dark, with electricity and telephone service interrupted. Thousands of homeless refugees are sleeping on the roadside. Candles are lit in front of many houses, indicating that at least one resident has been killed. Some bodies have already been placed in coffins, while many others are lying on the side of the road, covered with reed mats. At the same time, the other half of the city is still brightly lit, and life goes on as usual. The authorities have refused to release the casualty figures for yesterday's attack, as detailed reports from the affected areas are not yet complete. The National Relief Committee has sent relief teams to distribute food to the affected areas and is working to resettle thousands of homeless people. Madam Chiang Kai-shek and President Kung inspected the bombed areas yesterday. The only foreigner injured yesterday was a German named Trossel, an employee of Bolton Bros., a Shanghai-based American wool company at 312 Avenue Dubail. The 32-year-old suffered a minor knee injury when the building collapsed. His office is on the same street as Reuters. During yesterday's Japanese air raid, several bombs fell into the Yangtze River, but none fell near the British and American gunboats anchored on the south bank. According to Chinese official sources, a total of 18 Japanese bombers attacked yesterday, all taking the route southeast of Chongqing, Nanchuan, instead of flying east along the Yangtze River to avoid interception by Chinese fighter planes. When Chinese planes discovered that the Japanese planes had already reached Chongqing, they turned back and engaged them in combat. A certain foreigner witnessed two people jump out of a burning plane and parachute to the ground, but could not distinguish whether they were Chinese or Japanese. Yesterday, a bomb pierced the roof of a building across from the Reuters office, only a few yards away, but fortunately did not explode. (4th, Reuters Dispatch)

### After Indiscriminate Bombing, the Scars Are Everywhere

(Chongqing) Yesterday at 1 PM, just as residents of Chongqing were preparing lunch, the alarm suddenly sounded, and they rushed to the nearby air-raid shelters. Chinese fighters took off to intercept and patrolled the sky for 20 minutes before spotting Japanese bombers. The Japanese planes flew from west to east, dropping bombs along the streets of the north bank. Chinese fighters immediately engaged them, and anti-aircraft guns temporarily stopped firing to avoid interfering with Chinese operations. As a result, the sounds of planes whirring and machine guns firing were heard at the same time. After the Japanese planes fled, Chinese planes pursued them. About 30 bombs fell near the Reuters Chongqing office, narrowly avoiding being destroyed. The closest bomb landed only 15 yards away. The office of the French company, "Shu Fu" (transliteration) Shipping Company, was completely destroyed. A Reuters reporter walked just 100 yards from the office and saw the tragic scene caused by incendiary bombs. Dozens of closely spaced wooden houses were hit and caught fire, spreading rapidly. The Ta Kung Pao was also affected. Two hundred yards further, a large fire broke out on the hillside at the west end of the park. Military police and soldiers were dispatched to all bombed areas to maintain order, and traffic was cut off. Firefighters and civilian volunteers bravely fought the fires and rescued the injured. Two injured Chinese were dug out of the rubble of the French shipping company and immediately sent to the hospital. The results of the air battle and the number of casualties are currently unknown. During the air raid, a Reuters reporter was standing in the air-raid shelter, watching the actions of the Japanese bombers, when he suddenly heard the sharp sound of a falling bomb and quickly jumped into the shelter. Suddenly, with a loud roar, the ground shook, and glass bricks and tiles fell like rain. A large stone fell from the sky and landed at the entrance of the air-raid shelter, piercing the cement sidewalk to a depth of four inches. The reporter went out of the shelter again and saw that fires had broken out in seven places within a radius of 300 yards. Residents of the burning houses fled to the streets, some with minor injuries and others with blood on their faces, hands and feet. Their clothes were covered in dust. Due to a lack of stretchers, doors were taken off their hinges to carry the seriously injured to the hospital. Xincheng in the western suburbs was not affected this time. The south bank of the Yangtze River was not bombed, but a certain place far upstream was hit by bombs, indicating that the Japanese planes started bombing Chongqing from that location. Although the number of casualties is currently unknown, it must be at least 200 people. (4th, Reuters Dispatch)

(Chongqing) As a result of yesterday's indiscriminate bombing of Chongqing by 27 Japanese planes, according to information learned at the time of the telegram, 18 bombs fell in densely populated urban areas, causing countless buildings to catch fire. Institutions affiliated with the Ministry of Transportation and large hotels were set on fire by the bombing, and the fires had not yet been extinguished by evening. Other partially damaged buildings included the Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the Post Office, and four Chinese newspaper printing houses. The number of civilians killed was between 1,500 and 2,000. (4th, Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

### Japanese Still Lie About Not Targeting Civilians

(Tokyo) According to Japanese naval sources, the Japanese naval air force, led by Majors Masuda and Irisa, raided Chongqing yesterday, bombing various military installations. They then engaged 30 Chinese planes in an air battle for half an hour, during which ten Chinese planes were shot down by Japanese planes. Two Japanese planes were also lost, and the remainder returned to their base under intense anti-aircraft fire. A spokesman for the Japanese Navy stated at today's weekly press briefing that Japanese pilots are under strict orders to only bomb Chinese military installations and to take care not to attack civilian houses or foreign property. Each pilot carries a map of Chongqing, and all foreign property is marked in red. (4th, Reuters Dispatch)

### Guo Taiqi's Speech on China's War of Resistance, its Contribution to the World, Preventing the Expansion of Aggression, Expressing Gratitude to Britain and the Soviet Union for Their Substantial Aid to China

(London) The China Association held its annual banquet today at Claridge's, chaired by Ambassador Guo Taiqi. Fifty Chinese guests attended, as well as many foreign guests, including British Minister for Coordination of Defence Lord Chatfield, Cabinet Minister Morrison, Chief of the Imperial General Staff Gort, Air Ministry official Streetly, Lord Cecil, Lord Davies, Lord Snell, Lord Strabolgi, MPs Milner, Moreing, Astor, the famous British poet Binyon, Counselor Howe of the British Embassy in China, former British military commander in Shanghai Mallet, British university professor Adams, General Manager of British American Tobacco Wovoven, and Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky. Ambassador Guo rose and proposed a toast to the guests, and said:

The depth of sympathy shown by various British quarters for China is striking, such as: (1) the issuance of a memorandum on January 4, explaining its position on the Nine-Power Treaty, and taking an important step in rebuilding international and political morality; (2) the establishment of a fund to stabilize China's foreign exchange; (3) the provision of export credit to aid China; (4) the establishment of a fund to relieve Chinese war disasters; (5) the donation of books and instruments by British universities to newly established universities in western China. This spring, both the front and rear of China have made exciting progress, and we should sincerely congratulate China. The Chinese people are now strongly united, and the inherent Sino-British friendship is becoming stronger because of recent beneficial cooperation between the two countries.

Ambassador Guo continued that he knew that everyone present would welcome Ambassador Maisky, whose country not only showed great friendship to China during this serious time, but also served as a support for linking Europe and Asia. From now on, Asia will not forget Europe, and Europe will not forget Asia. Ambassador Guo then welcomed Lord Chatfield, who is currently engaged in coordinating the various aspects of Britain's national defense. China is also working hard to become an active and possible focal point for coordinating various elements of general international defense. China's dual process of national revival and resistance to aggression has now produced encouraging results. The scope of aggression has not expanded further, and the world has not deteriorated further, because China has prevented it. China's contribution is now rapidly being fully recognized by the West. The Chinese leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, believes that virtue is not alone and will eventually gain neighborly assistance, and all of China agrees with this.

### British Minister for Coordination of Defence's Speech, Cherishing Warm Sympathy for China

China's difficult struggle is similar to that of Britain. Post-war recovery will be like new flowers blooming, unstoppable.

Lord Chatfield rose on behalf of the guests to reply, elaborating on the reasons for Sino-British mutual understanding. He said that the Chinese are known for their trustworthiness, which has been the case since ancient times and still is today. The British also pride themselves on fulfilling their promises. We have made substantial promises recently, and the facts and decisions of the past few days have proved the reliability of our promises. The characteristic that we most admire and can benefit from is the Chinese respect for elders and sages, respecting things that exist through experience, rather than things that are easily acquired and quickly lost. Tonight, I very much wish to see China as a peaceful country, as represented in its art, rather than a land filled with war. But this is just a vain wish. China is currently suffering from useless and irreparable destruction. We are currently standing on the same precarious edge, knowing the folly of war, just as the Chinese do, but believing that when our personalities and beliefs are threatened, we must be prepared to sacrifice our lives, just as the Chinese do. During this difficult period of testing, we feel the deepest sympathy for the Chinese. The Chinese abandon their pens for swords, and we greatly admire this generous action of resisting aggression. Those who struggle arduously naturally become stronger after overcoming hardships. This is true for individuals and countries. Therefore, we firmly believe that China will emerge from the struggle as a strong country with new experience and new determination. I hope that the tragedy of nations of the same race killing each other in East Asia will soon cease, and that China will soon be able to restore its ordinary friendly relations with its island neighbors on an equal footing with its full sovereignty. Finally, I must mention one thing, that China, which is not fond of war, has produced a great leader in its time of need, a person with first-class military talent and the best qualities of his people, and who is respected worldwide. Not only that, but he also possesses the qualities that will be loved by all the people in the post-war recovery in the future. His selflessness and forgiving qualities have been seen after the Xi'an Incident. In addition, he possesses a great necessity for the future of the country, understanding China's old morality and his own cultivation. China is like a large pomelo tree, with roots so deep that they have seen thousands of years. Although the cold winter destroys its leaves and storms break its branches, it will still sprout new life from its ancient roots, and its new branches will be irrigated by Western principles and will blossom with new flowers from its old land, thriving and unstoppable. (3rd, Reuters Dispatch)

(London) The Manchester Guardian reported today that the remarks made by Minister for Coordination of Defence Lord Chatfield at the annual banquet of the China Association last night represented the British's warm sympathy for the Chinese people's war of resistance, and said that such friendly words were not false. Our sympathy is not based solely on our economic interests, and the Chinese will be happy to hear the minister's words. (4th, Reuters Dispatch)

### British MPs' Questions on Far East Issues

(London) The House of Commons met this afternoon, and several members raised questions about Far East issues. The proceedings are summarized as follows:

Yunnan-Burma Railway Traffic

Conservative MP Sir Wilson asked whether the government was aware that the Chinese government was building a railway to the Burmese border, and could provide assurance on two matters: (a) that it would not build a railway within Burma to connect with the Chinese railway; (b) that even if there were plans for a connection, it would conduct a public investigation in advance to determine the pros and cons and obtain the consent of the Burmese parliament. Under-Secretary of State for India, Lieutenant Colonel Muirhead, replied that as far as he knew, the Chinese government had already begun building a railway from Kunming, Yunnan Province, to the Burmese border. Although the proposal to connect it with the Burmese railway had been mentioned from time to time for the past 40 years, the government would not make any decision until it had consulted various relevant parties in Burma. He asked Sir Wilson to rest assured on this point.

Dredging Work Stalled

Conservative MP Mr. Milner asked whether the work of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, which is of great importance to international shipping, has been stalled since the outbreak of war between China and Japan. Although the government has repeatedly decided to negotiate with the Japanese authorities, hoping to continue the dredging work, no results have been achieved so far. He asked whether the Foreign Secretary intends to conduct further negotiations with Japan. Under-Secretary of State Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax was aware that the dredging work was of great importance. Negotiations are actively underway in Shanghai, and an agreement is expected to be reached in a short period of time.

Situation in Tianjin British Concession

Conservative MP Mr. Hanra asked whether the obstacles placed around the British Concession in Tianjin by the Japanese authorities had been removed. Under-Secretary of State Butler replied, "I will inform the House of Commons about the situation in Tianjin. There has been no change so far. The government is working hard to restore normalcy."

British Nationals Discriminated Against by Japan

Conservative MP Mr. Marsden asked whether the government had investigated the case of four British employees of a British company in Shanghai who were prevented from going to Hankou by the Japanese authorities, while two American employees of the same company were allowed to go there. Under-Secretary of State Butler replied that the incident did indeed happen as described. As far as he knew, the Japanese authorities would also allow British citizens to go to Hankou, while not allowing people from other countries to go there. (3rd, Havas Dispatch)

### Hong Kong Observatory Hurricane Report

The Hong Kong Observatory announced on the 4th that there is currently a hurricane at 12 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude, moving northwest by west, with winds within a radius of 60 miles. (4th Special Dispatch)

### Resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov; Molotov Concurrently Assumes Office; No Fundamental Change Expected in Foreign Policy; Anglo-Soviet Negotiations to Suffer Adverse Impact

(Moscow) An order from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR states that the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, submitted his resignation, which was approved. The Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Molotov, was appointed concurrently as the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. (TASS dispatch, 3rd)

(Moscow) The reason for the resignation of the Soviet Russian People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, has not yet been officially explained. However, regarding the impact of Litvinov's resignation, diplomatic sources here point out that Litvinov was a politician who advocated close cooperation with Western European countries and was responsible for the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations and forming an alliance with France. Therefore, it is anticipated that the negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union may suffer adverse effects after Litvinov's departure. (Haitong dispatch, 4th)

(Moscow) After the resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, the Anglo-Soviet talks will be conducted by the newly appointed Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Molotov. Litvinov has been in charge of foreign affairs for ten years, and his sudden retirement has left Moscow's diplomatic circles at a loss. Yesterday at 11:30 PM, a radio report stated that Litvinov had already voluntarily resigned from the position of Foreign Minister, and the vacancy was temporarily filled by Molotov. However, in the communique issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shortly afterward, the word "temporary" was removed. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not explain the general situation, but pointed out that Litvinov was 61 or 62 years old and in poor health. (Associated Press dispatch, 4th)

(London) After the resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, diplomatic circles here expressed surprise today. Their initial reaction was that Litvinov's resignation might indicate the victory of the isolationist faction in the Soviet Union, as the isolationists opposed Litvinov's policy of cooperation with Western Europe. Journalists at a meeting of the China Association informed the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, of the news, but he remained silent on the matter. Other Soviet personnel also refused to comment on Litvinov's move, but they had predicted a few days ago that if the United Kingdom and France did not accept the Soviet proposal for a strong mutual assistance treaty, the talks between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and France might break down. It is widely believed that the Soviet isolationist faction, including military leaders, believes that it is futile to win over the United Kingdom and France to stop aggression in Europe. The Soviet Union should retreat behind its defense lines, so that any direct attack on the Soviet Union can be repelled. (Associated Press dispatch, 4th)

(Moscow) After the resignation of the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, well-informed sources here declared that the move was due to the prolonged and inconclusive negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The concurrent holding of the foreign affairs portfolio by the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Molotov, is only temporary. However, responsible officials said that Litvinov's departure was due to poor health, and that rumors of a change in Soviet foreign policy were not accurate. "Because there is no so-called personal policy within the Soviet government, the consistent policy pursued by all authorities is a policy jointly owned by the Soviet government and the Communist Party." However, observers claim that Litvinov is 63 years old and physically strong, and it is unlikely that he would retire due to health reasons. He has always strongly advocated a collective security policy. At the Communist Party Congress, Stalin explicitly criticized Western European countries, saying that they wanted to start a war between Germany and the Soviet Union to solve their own difficulties, which clearly indicated his dissatisfaction with the principle of collective security. Until recently, the government suddenly decided to stop publishing the organ of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, the "Moscow Weekly" (published in French), presumably to strike at Litvinov. Moreover, Soviet newspapers did not mention a word about the progress of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, which shows that Litvinov's departure is related to the development of these negotiations, and the main reason for Litvinov's departure is that the United Kingdom and France refused to accept the Soviet proposal to conclude a military alliance treaty between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. In short, since the Munich Agreement, although the Soviet government allowed Litvinov to make a final test of the collective security policy, it has failed, and he had no choice but to submit his resignation. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)

### Soviet Officialdom Tight-lipped

(Moscow) Today's Soviet newspapers did not elaborate on Litvinov's resignation, only publishing on the front page the Soviet government's order appointing Molotov as Foreign Minister, and on another page a small notice stating that Litvinov had voluntarily resigned. Government officials also remained tight-lipped about the matter, not saying a word. Therefore, those who are overly sensitive believe that Litvinov may suffer the same fate as high-ranking officials who were dismissed in the past, ranging from imprisonment to execution. However, according to observations from diplomatic circles, Litvinov is unlikely to suffer a tragic fate. He was able to survive the previous purges unscathed, which was not due to luck. Furthermore, Litvinov participated in the May 1st celebrations this year, and his disagreement with Stalin must have been a recent matter. Litvinov believed that opposing fascism was the main purpose of Soviet foreign policy, while Stalin publicly declared in a speech a few weeks ago that Western European capitalist countries and fascist countries were birds of a feather, with no distinction between them. Stalin also accused the United Kingdom of trying to incite Germany to fight the Soviet Union, which was clearly different from Litvinov's policy of contacting the United Kingdom and France. He could not help but worry about Litvinov's mishandling of the situation, fearing that he would not be able to rein himself in, so he replaced him with Molotov. Also, it is reported that personnel in major Soviet embassies are expected to undergo changes due to Litvinov's departure, but it is difficult to predict the extent of the changes. (Haitong dispatch, 4th)

### Britain and France Greatly Surprised by Change of Soviet Foreign Minister

(London) The news of the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, was received here last night and was considered completely unexpected. The Foreign Office was greatly surprised. According to well-informed sources, Litvinov's resignation has nothing to do with the United Kingdom's recent response to the Soviet proposal, as the reply has not yet been sent to Moscow. Diplomatic sources here pointed out that although Molotov has been the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars for many years, he is not politically important. This decision to continue in foreign affairs is expected to lead to a change in Soviet foreign policy, but it is difficult to predict its direction at this time. (Haitong dispatch, 4th)

(Paris) After the news of the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, and the appointment of Molotov as his successor reached here, political and diplomatic circles in France were greatly surprised, and the general public also paid close attention. According to sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Litvinov's departure is due to one of two reasons: either the Soviet Union does not approve of Litvinov's Western European policy, or the government is dissatisfied with the slow progress of negotiations with Western European countries. These people expressed doubt about the future effectiveness of the Franco-Soviet alliance, and at the same time were pessimistic about future negotiations between Western European countries and Soviet Russia. (Haitong dispatch, 4th)

(London) Today's editorial in the Standard Evening News, after examining the various complex relationships surrounding the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, and the various events currently occurring behind the scenes in Japan, stated that the reason why Japan is adhering to a more reasonable attitude must be in the Soviet Union's interests. The newspaper also said that the threat and pressure felt by the Soviet Union on its eastern border are easing at a time when deeper rifts are occurring between Germany and Poland in the West. The guarantees offered by the United Kingdom and France to Poland have formed a buffer between Germany and the Soviet Union. While the newspaper acknowledged that there are infinite difficulties in reaching this conclusion, it stated, "We may eventually see the lion and the lamb lying down together." The newspaper concluded by saying that Japan's refusal to formalize the Anti-Comintern Pact as an alliance makes it difficult for European dictatorships to plan a final test of war in the near future. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

(London) British newspapers are increasingly frustrated by the slow progress of negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Now that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, has suddenly resigned, anxiety is even greater. Although general commentary is veiled, a pessimistic mood is evident between the lines. The Times' foreign affairs reporter declared, "Litvinov's resignation was not anticipated by British officials. It would be premature to conclude at this point that Soviet foreign policy is about to change, because according to news received here from Moscow, Soviet officials have stated that the country's policy towards Western European countries remains the same." The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, stated, "Litvinov's resignation is not only unexpected, but also quite astonishing. Until last night, Soviet officials and the British Foreign Office had not dreamed of this. Moreover, important international negotiations are underway, and the United Kingdom's response to the Soviet proposal is scheduled to be sent within days, and it is strange that Litvinov's resignation occurred at this time. It is also noteworthy that the vacant position of People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs was not filled by Deputy Commissar Potemkin. Regardless of the reason for this change, Litvinov has served the Soviet Union to the best of his ability and has made outstanding contributions, and his retirement can be considered honorable." (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### Various Speculations about the Reasons for Litvinov's Resignation

(Paris) Although newspapers here consider the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, unexpected, their views differ depending on their affiliations. There is no consensus. They have also speculated about the real reasons for this matter and its impact, with mutually different views. The Radical Socialist Party's newspaper, L'Ere Nouvelle, stated, "According to news last night, German leader Hitler has no reason to be pleased with the change of Soviet foreign affairs officials, because Stalin believes that the Soviet Union has reached a period of accepting extremely serious constraints, and wants to personally preside over foreign affairs negotiations. The new People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, is not easily intimidated in negotiations, and will certainly follow Stalin's intentions in everything. If so, then Litvinov's departure may be a representation of opposition to the current policy of the League of Nations, which can be deeply believed. We have recently learned from reliable sources that Stalin has absolutely no intention of changing the current policy of Western European countries, on the contrary, he wants to strengthen its implementation." The Socialist Party's newspaper, Le Populaire, stated that Litvinov's censure may be related to the slow progress of negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, which seems reasonable. In this regard, it can be viewed separately: one is that Litvinov's departure is due to the failure to quickly complete the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, so Molotov's succession will make accelerating the negotiations a priority; the other is that Litvinov, regardless of difficulties, continued to negotiate with the United Kingdom tirelessly, which caused disagreement with the Soviet authorities, so he was uneasy in his position. Therefore, Soviet policy will change its course in the future. It is difficult to determine which of the two views is correct at this time. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)

(New York) The New York Times commented on the appointment of Soviet Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov concurrently as Foreign Minister, stating that Washington diplomatic circles consider this a very serious development in the European situation. At a time when crises are rife and important international negotiations are underway, Litvinov's resignation is surprising. The reason may be that the position of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs has long been coveted, and Litvinov was finally uneasy in his position, or because the current negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union have not yet achieved success. One of the two must be the case. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)

### Soviet Action Meant to Warn Britain and France

Paris French political figures recently declared that regarding the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, the information obtained here is incomplete and it is difficult to know its true meaning. According to news from London, the British side believes that the sudden change of Soviet foreign affairs officials while negotiations are underway among the countries concerned is regrettable. According to news from Warsaw, Poland was already concerned about Litvinov's advocacy of all countries joining the collective security system accepting automatic joint obligations, and his departure has been a relief. Political figures here have commented, stating that the change of Soviet foreign affairs officials does not necessarily mean a change in foreign policy. The Soviet government is hesitant about accepting certain obligations in the Far East and along the Baltic Sea coast, and is using this to warn them. In other words, Litvinov's retirement is intended to point out to the British and French governments the great value of Soviet cooperation during the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, before Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck delivers a speech. In addition, it is widely rumored in Moscow that the concurrent holding of the foreign affairs portfolio by Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov is only temporary, and it is highly possible that Deputy Commissar Potemkin will be promoted to the position. Potemkin once served as the ambassador to France, and is currently negotiating an agreement with the Turkish authorities in the Turkish capital to supplement the guarantees proposed by the United Kingdom and France (that the United Kingdom and France have already given unilateral guarantees to Turkey), which has actually been completed. It would be a good thing for Soviet foreign affairs to be presided over by him. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### Berlin Closely Watches Soviet Foreign Policy Trends

(Berlin) The general public here is indifferent to the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov. The newspapers say that Litvinov was a great enemy of communism, and his departure is welcome news for Germany. In addition, government officials say that individual advances and retreats are not of great importance. What needs to be verified now is whether Soviet foreign policy is still linked to the Third International, in other words, whether it still aims at world revolution. If Soviet policy remains the same, then Germany's current policy will not change. However, it can be asserted that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Western European countries will inevitably be affected by Litvinov's departure. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

(Berlin) Officials here refused to comment on the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, today. All newspapers believe that Litvinov's resignation is only related to Western European countries, and Germany can deal with it calmly. A certain German newspaper said, "We can fairly assume that Litvinov's retirement at this time is often detrimental to the United Kingdom and France. Some countries deeply understand their own unsoundness and are now running around begging other countries for help. As for whether the new People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, will follow the old rules or find another path, it is still unknown." Another German newspaper said that Litvinov's resignation is a "failure" of Soviet foreign policy in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, and the Western Hemisphere. Those who bear heavy diplomatic responsibilities should resign. (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)

### Brief Biography of Molotov

(Moscow) After Molotov was ordered to succeed Litvinov as the Soviet Russian People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, the world paid close attention to Molotov. Molotov is currently 49 years old, born in Kukarka in 1890. His original name was Scriabin, which he later changed to his current name. He joined the Communist Party in 1906, and in 1924 he was appointed as a member of the Communist Party's Politburo. It is said that his understanding of foreign affairs and politics is quite limited. (Haitong dispatch, 4th) The Morning Express reported that the new Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, does not approve of the collective security system, either in theory or in practice. In particular, he is a confidant of Stalin and deeply loved by the Red Army. His policy is based on peace and balance of power, and he is resolute and ambitious. He has repeatedly launched fierce attacks against Germany, which has always been known as a deadly enemy of National Socialism. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### Negotiations on Collective Security Organization Have Not Yet Achieved Success; Taking Advantage of the League of Nations Meeting on the 15th, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Will Continue Discussions in Geneva

(London) Regarding the organization of a collective security system, the foreign affairs officials of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union will take advantage of the regular meeting of the League of Nations Council on the 15th of this month to discuss everything in Geneva. The talks between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union may not achieve any success before the 15th, but the new proposal submitted by the British government to the Soviet Union has been handed over by Foreign Office official Cadogan to French Ambassador Corbin, and its content advocates: (1) The Soviet Union provides guarantees to the countries along the Baltic and Black Seas. This guarantee will only be implemented when the United Kingdom and France provide assistance to these countries. (2) Once the Soviet Union provides unilateral guarantees to these countries, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union should establish a mutual assistance agreement. However, this new proposal is not intended to be sent to the Soviet government for the time being, for four reasons: (1) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today, "The claim that the United Kingdom is pursuing a policy of encirclement is baseless. I have clearly stated that the British government is happy to consider all proposals aimed at mutual guarantees between the United Kingdom and Germany. Attention must be paid to how the German government responds to this expression from the Prime Minister." (2) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck is scheduled to deliver a speech in the House on the 5th of this month to respond to German leader Hitler, and it may be possible to open up a path for friendly negotiations between Germany and Poland. (3) After the German government proposed to the governments of the Nordic countries to conclude non-aggression pacts, the foreign ministers of these countries are scheduled to hold a meeting in the Swedish capital on the 9th of this month to discuss them. It is also necessary to know the views of these countries. (4) Recently, Italy's attitude towards Western European countries has been significantly more conciliatory. The country's newspapers no longer carry out anti-French propaganda; relations between Italy and Egypt have improved, and the Governor of Italian Libya, General Balbo, will soon visit Egypt; according to news from Rome, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to go to Italy tomorrow because of difficulties in the discussion of military cooperation between Germany and Italy. It is said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has expressed disagreement with the proposal that Italy should automatically fight alongside Germany when war breaks out, regardless of where the war starts. In short, when the United Kingdom will send the new proposal to the Soviet government always depends on the evolution of the situation. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)

(Moscow) Well-informed sources here recently commented on the resignation of People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, stating that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and France, namely the negotiations on organizing a collective security system, are clearly related to this matter. The United Kingdom and France, in providing guarantees to Romania and Greece, did not ask these countries to provide the same guarantees, nor did they consult the Soviet Union in advance, which the Soviet side already felt unhappy about, and has always believed that only cooperation between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union can form collective security. However, the United Kingdom and France did not establish an understanding with the Soviet Union and hastily provided guarantees to small countries, which inevitably reversed the order. At this point, the United Kingdom and France cannot force small countries to accept Soviet cooperation, which is not self-inflicted? Moreover, since the Munich Agreement, the Soviet Union has been forced to pursue an isolationist policy, and can leave Western European countries without fear because of its strong national power. Moreover, both Germany and Italy are contacting the Soviet Union, either proposing to conclude commercial agreements or promoting trade, which shows that it is not difficult for the Soviet Union to abandon its isolationist policy. After all, it is still willing to cooperate with Western European countries again on an equal footing, accepting reciprocal obligations, and providing practical guarantees to each other.

### German Diplomacy Actively Engaged; Foreign Minister Visits Rome

(Berlin) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will travel to Rome tonight to hold several days of discussions with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. (Associated Press dispatch, 4th)

(Berlin) Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to go to Italy today to hold talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Well-informed sources here commented that the Foreign Minister's trip is a sign of Germany's active diplomatic engagement in all areas. It is necessary to consult with Italy in advance to agree on a unified action of the Berlin-Rome axis on various issues. Regarding Germany's negotiations with the Scandinavian Peninsula countries (namely Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) and the Baltic Sea coastal countries (namely Finland, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia), the German government has not yet made proposals, but has only exchanged views with these countries. It is too early to say that the German government has provided guarantees to these countries or proposed to sign non-aggression pacts with these countries. It is also not accurate to say that the German government has held the same talks with Greece, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, but Germany is currently exchanging views with the Scandinavian Peninsula and Baltic Sea coastal countries, which may extend to other countries, including those listed by US President Roosevelt in his telegram. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

(Berlin) German leader Hitler suggested today that Germany, while waiting for Polish Foreign Minister Beck's reply, should consolidate its northern and southern fronts. The German government announced that it had agreed with Sweden and Finland to set up defenses on the Aland Islands, and at the same time announced that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop would travel to Rome to hold a meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Some neutral observers believe that the German Foreign Minister's trip to Rome has a very unusual nature, as it aims to dispel Italy's misunderstanding of Germany's policy towards England. Moreover, since Italy has very close relations with Poland, the Roman authorities are deeply concerned about the tense relations between Germany and Poland. Germany's actions towards Danzig or the Polish Corridor may use the axis policy to seek its own interests, while on the Italian side, although it defends Germany's back door, it is in vain. At the same time, Rome fears that Germany's problem with Poland may drag Italy into a war vortex, and Italy has no direct interest in this kind of war. (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)

(Berlin) Well-informed sources here declared that Aviation Minister General Goering went to San Remo, Italy, yesterday, and is scheduled to arrive at 6:30 PM today, and is scheduled to stay for a week. Mrs. Goering did not accompany him. Officials here refused to comment on Goering's trip, and the outside world knows nothing about the reason. Some sources said that when the Spanish National Army enters Madrid in triumph on the 15th of this month, General Goering will also represent Germany and leader Hitler himself to participate, but officials and semi-officials have not yet confirmed it. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### Poland Resists German Aggression; France Willing to Provide Backup; Polish Foreign Minister to Issue Declaration Today Responding to German Demands on Danzig

(Paris) According to semi-official sources, the French government has asserted that if Germany takes any action in Danzig and Poland resists such action, France is willing to aid Poland. (Reuters, 3rd)

Warsaw: Foreign Minister Beck is scheduled to deliver a declaration at the House of Representatives at 11:30 tomorrow morning in response to Chancellor Hitler's speech on the 28th of last month. Foreign Minister Sempek met yesterday with British Ambassador Kennard to explain the main points of the declaration. According to sources close to the government, the declaration is not very long and is expected to take only half an hour. Although the wording will be firm, it will be delivered in a diplomatic tone, without any alarming nature, contrary to what is widely reported in the newspapers. The authorities have also decided to broadcast it nationwide through wireless radio stations, and after translating it into French, it will be rebroadcast by French radio stations. (Havas, 3rd)

(Berlin) Experienced observers here have recently stated that after the Polish government adopted a tough stance on the issue of the Free City of Danzig, the German authorities seem to be in a predicament. Their proposed actions against Poland have been delayed, and in the future, they will likely be replaced by long-term actions. The reactions of Britain and France are also quite disappointing, which is one of the reasons why Germany is cautious in dealing with Poland. In addition, the attitude of Italy must also be ascertained before taking offensive actions against Poland. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Italy is for this reason. As for Germany's proposal to establish non-aggression pacts with the Nordic countries, there are two purposes: one is to correct the negative impression caused by Germany's abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact; the other is to prepare for future conflicts between Germany and Poland, so that all Nordic countries can maintain neutrality.

### Foreign Ministers Meeting of Four Nordic Countries

To be held in Stockholm next Tuesday to discuss the treaty with Germany

Copenhagen: Responsible officials here have recently stated that after Germany proposed yesterday to the Nordic countries, namely Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, to conclude a mutual non-aggression pact, the foreign ministers of these countries are scheduled to hold a meeting in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, on the 9th of this month to discuss it. (Havas, 3rd)

(Paris) "Le Journal" reported that Germany recently proposed to the Nordic and Baltic countries to conclude a mutual non-aggression pact, which has caused great turmoil here. According to the newspaper's diplomatic correspondent, Germany took this step in response to the Soviet Union's joining France and the Baltic countries to form a mutual assistance pact. The correspondent believes that if Germany's proposal succeeds, the effectiveness of the Soviet Union's joining the mutual assistance pact will be completely lost. (Haitong, 4th)

Copenhagen: It is reported that Germany, in order to maintain the neutrality of its northern region in the event of a major war, has proposed to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia to conclude a non-aggression pact. According to a statement issued by the Berlin authorities, if Sweden and Finland can maintain absolute neutrality in a future world war, then both countries can build defenses on the Åland Islands. Germany intends to prevent the Åland Islands from being seized by the Soviet Union and used as a base for naval and air forces, which would be detrimental to Germany. Based on this, if Germany's non-aggression treaty with the Scandinavian countries can be concluded, then Germany may not occupy the Åland Islands. (Associated Press, 4th)

### Romanian Foreign Minister Leaves Italy for Home; Cordial Talks in Rome

(Rome) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu departed for home this evening. Foreign Minister Ciano and other dignitaries saw him off at the station. According to an official statement, "Foreign Minister Gafencu held extremely cordial talks with Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano on various issues of interest to both Italy and Romania, and satisfactory results have been achieved." Before his departure, Gafencu told the press that his visit to various countries was purely informal and no agreements were concluded with any country. The friendly relations between Italy and Romania have not changed due to Italy's occupation of Albania. The relationship between the two countries is not only emotional but also of great economic value. Today, all countries hope for peace, but their concepts of peace are not consistent. As for the relationship between Germany and Poland, it is indeed very serious. It is hoped that both sides can find a solution through mutual understanding. (Havas, 3rd)

(Tokyo) "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that after repeated meetings of the five ministers and frequent meetings with important cabinet members, Japan has formulated a policy regarding the European situation.

(Berlin) It is rumored that Germany, Italy, and Japan are currently conducting negotiations to discuss the issue of concluding a military alliance treaty. Responsible officials here have denied this. According to news from Tokyo, although Japanese Foreign Minister Arita met with the ambassadors of Germany and Italy to discuss the European situation, the purpose was to obtain accurate information from the most reliable sources. It is natural for Japan to be concerned about the European situation. (Havas, 4th)

### U.S. Army and Navy Officers Study Strengthening Defenses at the Panama Canal; Plan to Build Strong Naval and Air Bases in Mexico; $150 Million in Defense Funds Approved by President

(Washington) U.S. Army and Navy officers are currently studying plans to build strong naval and air bases at the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal.

### Hull Explains U.S. Policy; Military and Economic Power as Weapons; Safeguarding the Security of the New World

(New York) Assistant Secretary of State Hull recently delivered a speech at the local Political Academy, stating that President Roosevelt said that if any party threatens the independence of the Americas with force, the United States will respond with appropriate military measures. If the Americas suffer economic threats, the United States will also provide full economic assistance. In short, the policy pursued by the United States in Latin America is a policy of peace and understanding, with the goal of maintaining the independence of the Americas, which is completely different from the so-called Roman peace in history, which only focused on conquest. This policy began to be implemented when Spanish power in the Americas was eliminated, and after the Monroe Doctrine was promoted, it began to take shape, and after the declaration of American Continental Solidarity was issued last year, it was fully realized. This declaration stated that the American countries should adjust their actions to safeguard territorial integrity and political systems. In short, the Roman concept of peace has been replaced by the concept of an "international community." To this day, a certain country is engaged in political and economic propaganda in the Americas, and German newspapers even say that a certain American country has failed to fully develop its resources, and the land inhabited by white people is therefore threatened. For example, most of Brazil should be controlled by Germany. All this is the "vital space" doctrine promoted by Germany, which should be attacked by all. Some people are worried that fascism, national socialism, and communism are trying to promote their ideas in the Americas. In fact, although this kind of propaganda wants to destroy the unity of the Americas and inject new imperialism into the Americas, there is no need to worry too much. Since the United States is a pillar of American Continental Solidarity, various movements, whether belonging to communism or originating from the German-Italian axis, are all aimed at our country. We know how to deal with it. (Havas, 3rd)

However, there is currently no news of the ships coming to Hong Kong. (Reuters, 4th)

### U.S. President Plans to Promote the Implementation of New Neutrality Legislation; As a Response to Hitler's Speech; So That Arms Can Be Supplied to Britain and France in Wartime

(Washington) According to responsible sources here, President Roosevelt's only response to Hitler's speech will be to submit to Congress a request to implement the new neutrality legislation for cash-and-carry. It is reported that this plan will allow the United States to supply arms to Britain and France in the event of war, as long as Britain and France can pay the necessary cash. It is also reported that President Roosevelt has decided not to issue a rebuttal to Hitler's speech.

### The Japanese Army Invading Guangdong's Strategy of Occupying Danshui Estuary

Planning to attack Heshan and Gaoming to threaten Zhaoqing; Chinese military authorities have made strict preparations

Hong Kong Correspondent: The Japanese army invading Siyi launched an attack on Danshui Estuary on April 25, with troops advancing by both land and water from Xinhui. The waterway involved the use of shallow-water boats, pushing in from the Fenshui River; the land route involved the use of cavalry and armored vehicles, pushing forward along Daze Siqian. At the same time, aircraft were dispatched for bombing and cover. Under the fierce attacks of the Japanese army's land, sea, and air forces, the Chinese army resisted all day on the 25th and 26th. Various defense works were destroyed, and they withdrew their positions from Danshui Estuary, retreating towards Zhaiwu, which belongs to Heshan, and Kaiping. As a result, the situation in Taikai and Heshan counties suddenly became tense. The current situation is as follows: Xinchang Dihai, which belongs to Taishan County, and Changsha Sanbu, which belongs to Kaiping County, are located 45 li upstream of Danshui Estuary. The area is connected in a triangular shape, with thriving commerce and convenient transportation. After the front of the Xijiang River was blocked, the counties along the south bank of the Xijiang River have been using tributaries to communicate with Jiangmen and Macau for several months. After the successive fall of Jiangmen and Xinhui, Siyi can still use the transfer of Sanbu to reach Macau. Now that Danshui Estuary has fallen again, the only tributary of the Xijiang River leading to the sea is completely blocked. On the 27th, two Japanese shallow-water warships and five or six rubber boats were suddenly found patrolling the river surface of Sanbu. The guerrillas on both sides opened fire, and the Japanese army retreated back to the river surface of Danshui Estuary without landing. Currently, the population of Sanbu has been ordered to evacuate, and shops and residents are moving to other places. The ferry between Macau and Qianshan has been completely suspended because the river surface of Danshui Estuary has been cut off by the Japanese army, and ships cannot pass through. The roads in the nearby villages have also been completely destroyed, and the entire territory of Siyi has entered a state of extreme emergency.

According to military observers, after the Japanese army occupied Danshui Estuary, they can in fact control Siyi, and the fall of Sanbu is also imminent. The terrain of Sanbu is flat, with no danger to defend, and it only takes an hour to go upstream from Danshui Estuary. However, from a military point of view, Sanbu has no important value. If the Japanese army wants to invade Gaolei in the south, they can choose a landing area on the Leizhou Peninsula without having to advance from Sanbu. If they must invade from Sanbu, they will have to cross Enping, Yangjiang, and Dianbai. If so, the battle line will be too long, and there is a risk of being defeated by the Chinese army everywhere. Based on this observation, it can be asserted that there will be no major battles in Sanbu. However, the purpose of the Japanese army's fight for Danshui Estuary this time is to block the transportation of Siyi on the one hand, to cut off the supplies and transportation in the guerrilla area, and on the other hand to cover the Japanese army in the Xijiang River, attacking Heshan and Gaoming, as a prelude to the capture of Zhaoqing. This shows the strategy of the Japanese army.

The southwest military authorities have made comprehensive preparations for the actions of the Japanese army. For Siyi, it is divided into guerrilla areas, and the "scorched earth" plan is used to thoroughly evacuate the people, move food and all resources, and ensure that no grain or resource is left to help the enemy, so as to stop the Japanese army from advancing. Heavy troops are stationed in the mountainous areas of Gaohe and other counties, and solid fortifications are built to prepare for a fierce mountain battle with the Japanese army to consume the strength of the Japanese army. Cai Tingkai, the newly arrived Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the ×× Group Army in Guangxi, is in command of the military affairs of Siyi, and Deng Longguang is in command of the military affairs of Xijiang and Gaohe. Cai and Deng have now personally gone to the front line to plan everything.

### Jiangsu Province Orders All Counties to Ban Grain Exports Again

In order to maintain food supply for the people and the army

Xinghua Correspondent: The Jiangsu Provincial Government has repeatedly issued orders to prohibit the export of food. Recently, as the Japanese army has gradually penetrated inland and is approaching the border, the previous ban on Jiangkou and Haikou cannot be effectively enforced everywhere. According to recent investigations, grain merchants often use the excuse of inland circulation to purchase and smuggle grain from various counties, taking the opportunity to profit, resulting in the price of wheat rising to more than eight yuan per dan and the price of rice rising to between five and six yuan in recent months. This province is now suffering from the aftermath of war and floods, and food is already scarce. If smuggling is still allowed, the food supply for the people and the army will be at risk. Therefore, it is specially re-stipulated and ordered that the county magistrates of all counties shall only allow the circulation of rice and wheat within the county boundaries, and prohibit transportation out of the county. All public officials, autonomous personnel, and team officers and soldiers should strengthen the protection of rice and wheat within the county boundaries. If there are any cases of delays, extortion, or fraud, the county magistrate should investigate and deal with them strictly to warn against illegal activities. If there is a real need for mutual supply of food between counties, the person applying for supply should submit a statement stating the facts of the need for supply, its type and quantity, the supply location, and the names and addresses of the purchasers. After the county magistrate in charge is responsible for reviewing and confirming the information, he should consult with the neighboring county and report it to the province for approval. Then, the county will fill out a purchase and transportation certificate and purchase from the neighboring county, and exchange it for a transportation certificate before it can be transported to the supply location. Those who use public office for personal gain, attempt to aid the enemy, or seek to profit by deception will be severely punished according to the law once they are discovered or reported. The county magistrate in charge should also be severely punished to clarify responsibility. The case is related to prohibiting food from aiding the enemy and maintaining the food supply for the people and the army, so it must be handled effectively and without negligence.

### Floods in Various Counties in Northern Jiangsu; Provincial Government Allocates Wheat for Relief

The disaster situation is most serious in Huaiyin, Huaian, and Baoying counties

Taixian Correspondent: The floods suffered in Huaiyin, Huaian, Siyang, Baoying, and Binhu areas last autumn were extremely tragic. Since the beginning of spring, spring floods have arrived, and Yishui and Sishui rivers have also risen, and areas along Hongze Lake and Baoying rivers have been flooded again. Disaster victims are everywhere and urgently need relief. The Huaiyin County Government previously reported the disaster situation to the province, stating that the masses of refugees in the urban area gathered in Huxiang, and in addition to the flood disaster, there was also military disaster. It is requested that a huge sum of money be allocated quickly to carry out emergency relief work. At the same time, the provincial government secretary-general turned to Acting Chairman Han and requested that 3,000 shi of wheat stored in Huaian be allocated to Huaiyin, Huaian, and Baoying counties to jointly deal with the emergency relief work in Huxi, and to allocate more than 1,000 bags of wheat to the Huaiyin County Magistrate to organize relief work along the lake to facilitate bilateral rescue. He also asked the Shanghai Jiangsu Provincial Refugee Relief Association to raise donations for relief, which has been approved by Chairman Han and ordered to be handled separately.

### Wuxi Japanese Puppet Army Invades Baitang Embankment

### Danyang Japanese Army Invades Fangxian Bridge Area

### Shanghai Municipal Council Education Department Evaluates Teacher Qualifications

University Graduates Classified as Level One; Non-University Graduates as Level Two

The male and female teachers of the Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement had previously requested the council to re-evaluate their positions. The council then submitted this matter for discussion, believing that there were sufficient reasons for it to be considered by the Evaluation Committee. After hearing the opinions of the Director of the Education Department, the committee believed that this matter should indeed be further studied and resolved to suggest to the board of directors that the existing grading system be appropriately modified. University graduates who have received specialized training and hold certificates are currently classified in Level 1 of Category Two (D) and Level 1 of Category Two (E) in the Specialist Personnel (Education) category. Non-university graduates who have received specialized training and hold certificates are classified in Level 2 of Category Two (D) and Level 2 of Category Two (E). However, after nine years of service, those with excellent performance and proven teaching ability may also be promoted to Level One. The Education Committee has now proposed that male teachers belonging to Level 1 of Category Two (D) and female teachers belonging to Category Two (E) be classified in Category (A) of the staff. However, there are some differences regarding the benefits that married female staff in Category (A) should enjoy. According to the newly proposed method, male and female teachers belonging to Level Two will still be classified in Category (B). However, after fourteen years of service, they may be promoted to Level One and enjoy the benefits that Category (A) staff should enjoy. The Evaluation Committee's recommendations have been adopted by the board of directors.

### City Celebrates Anniversary of Revolutionary Government's Establishment by Hanging Flags

Notices Issued by Both Settlement Taxpayer Associations; Various Groups Release Open Letters to Fellow Citizens

Today marks the 18th anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government by the Premier of the Kuomintang as Extraordinary Grand President. All citizens of the city, in accordance with the central government's regulations and the joint decision of various sectors in the city, should voluntarily hang flags for one day to celebrate. Various groups have also released open letters to the public, encouraging fellow citizens to strengthen their beliefs. Regarding past flag-hanging negotiations, various central ministries and departments have sent telegrams of condolences. The details are as follows:

Flag-Hanging Notices

(1) The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement announced: It has been temporarily decided by various groups that citizens of the International Settlement will hang the national flag for a total of eight days per year, including January 1st, March 12th, March 29th, May 5th, July 1st, August 27th, October 10th, and November 12th. This is hereby announced. (2) The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession announced: For notification purposes, May 5th is the anniversary of Sun Premier's inauguration as Extraordinary Grand President. All citizens within our concession should hang the national flag on that day to celebrate enthusiastically. This is of utmost importance. This notice is hereby issued.

Open Letters to Fellow Citizens

The open letters to fellow citizens issued by various groups are summarized as follows: (1) In the tenth year of the Republic of China, warlords and politicians destroyed laws and discipline and attempted to undermine the revolutionary forces led by our party. In order to reorganize the revolutionary ranks and consolidate the foundation of the country, the Premier assumed the position of Extraordinary Grand President elected by the Extraordinary National Assembly in Guangdong on May 5th of the tenth year of the Republic of China, and established the Revolutionary Government, laying the foundation for the establishment of the National Government. All fellow citizens of our city should deeply understand and earnestly emulate this spirit of great fearlessness and struggle. (2) The Premier devoted his life to fighting against all counter-revolutionary forces, with the aim of seeking China's independence, freedom, and equality. Today, the all-out war of resistance is rapidly unfolding. Soldiers throughout the country are building a great wall with their blood and flesh, and fellow citizens throughout the country are contributing manpower, materials, and financial resources to the government. The aim is also to strive for national independence, freedom, and equality. Therefore, as we commemorate the establishment of the Revolutionary Government today, we should further strengthen the spirit of struggle, strengthen our will, and complete the Premier's unfinished business. (3) In the first phase of the war of resistance, both spirit and matter were equally important. In the second phase of the war of resistance, spirit is more important than matter. The psychological construction indicated in the Premier's teachings is the highest theoretical basis, and the program promulgated by Chairman Chiang and its implementation methods are different plans for implementing the Premier's psychological construction teachings. Therefore, as we commemorate the establishment of the Revolutionary Government, we should personally practice with an organized spirit, use manpower, material resources, and financial resources to lay the cornerstone of inevitable victory.

Central Government Condolences

(1) The Central Propaganda Department sent a telegram: The enthusiastic promotion by the citizens of Shanghai demonstrates a deep patriotism, which is deeply appreciated. Looking east from Bayu, we are filled with concern. Please convey the Central Committee's utmost concern. (2) The Central Social Affairs Department sent a telegram: The flag-hanging case has reached the sky, and the spirit of struggle of the Shanghai citizens is admired by China and foreign countries alike. Now that we have heard that all arrested compatriots are safe and sound, we are pleased and send this telegram of condolences. (3) The Central Secretariat sent a telegram: Regarding the flag-hanging matter, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently replied that after receiving the news, the Ministry has made representations to the French Embassy. The reply stated that the flag had been returned, and the person had been released. A written protest was also lodged on the following day, requesting that necessary steps be taken to correct the situation and that the freedom of our residents to hang flags should not be interfered with again. This is specially notified for your reference.

### French Concession Maintains Security

In order to maintain order and security within the French Concession and prevent unscrupulous individuals from taking advantage of opportunities to cause trouble, the French Concession police authorities have dispatched all Chinese, French, Vietnamese, and Russian detectives on duty to patrol in sections to maintain security. However, because all Chinese detectives have been dispatched on duty, they have no time to attend court in the Second Special District Court to report on the cases they are handling. Therefore, the police department has scheduled to suspend the interrogation of public prosecution cases for one day today, that is, old cases that were previously interrogated will be rescheduled, and those that were scheduled to be re-examined today will also be postponed. The court will proceed with civil and criminal self-prosecution cases as usual today. The French police department also handled the situation in this manner on May 1, International Labor Day. This shows the administrative and police authorities of the French Concession's painstaking efforts to maintain order and security within the concession.

### Dead and Wounded Japanese Soldiers Continuously Transported to Shanghai

Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, another Japanese military truck loaded with corpses was seen on Minguo Road in the southern part of the city. It was reported that this corpse truck came from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Due to the recent battles in Xiashi and Fengshumiao, as well as on the Sujia Road, there have been many Japanese casualties. The guerrilla warfare on other roads is also very fierce. Therefore, the Japanese side has changed the timetable for the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou trains since April 21st to allow the locomotives to transport Japanese troops and military supplies.

### Rumor that Chen Bijun Arrives in Shanghai

It is rumored that Chen Bijun, who has been residing in Hanoi, arrived in Shanghai alone by plane the day before yesterday (the 3rd). When the plane arrived at the Datang Airport, traffic in the Hongkou area was cut off, and Japanese soldiers were stationed three steps apart and five steps apart, with strict security. After Chen got off the plane, she changed to a car prepared by the Japanese and drove directly to the Broadway Mansion on North Suzhou Road. It is reported that Chen came here to absorb female members in an attempt to organize a "Chinese Women's National Salvation Association" to support her husband. Such outrageous actions by Wang and Chen will surely be abandoned by the people of the country.

### Japan Attempts to Reorganize Concessions, British Government Refuses, Spokesman Says Amendment to Land Regulations Must be Approved by Chinese Government

(Associated Press, London, 4th) A British government spokesman refused yesterday evening to reorganize the administration of the Shanghai International Settlement, saying the British government believes the current administrative system in Shanghai is fair to both Japan and Britain. The spokesman was addressing the Japanese demands presented yesterday by Japanese Foreign Ministry official Renzo Sawada to the British and American ambassadors in Tokyo.

Several Clauses of Japanese Demands

The demand includes a reply to the protests lodged by Britain and the United States with Japan two months ago over incidents involving Japan and third countries in Shanghai. The Japanese government also demanded that the general status of Japanese personnel in the Municipal Council be raised and that the number of Japanese representatives in the Municipal Council be increased. In addition, the suppression of anti-Japanese activities and terrorist parties in the International Settlement is also among the demands.

British Taxes Twice Those of Japanese

A British government spokesman said in a solemn tone last night that Britain considers the current administrative system in Shanghai to be extremely fair. He acknowledged Japan's claim that Japanese investment in Shanghai has substantially increased, but at the same time pointed out that the property taxes and donations paid by the British in Shanghai are almost twice those paid by the Japanese. Therefore, the ratio of British to Japanese representatives on the Municipal Council, at five to two, is fair.

Amendment of Regulations is a Legal Issue

The British government spokesman also emphasized that amendments to the Land Regulations must be approved by the Chinese government in Chongqing before they can be made. However, he believes that such consent is unlikely to be obtained. If the Land Regulations are amended solely on the basis of the wishes of a "puppet organization," there are concerns that legal problems will arise and that the amendments will not be effective.

Limits to British-Japanese Cooperation

As for the Japanese demand for practical recognition of the "Great Way Municipal Government" under Japanese control, unofficial sources here believe that the maximum extent of cooperation between Britain and Japan to adjust the situation in the Shanghai International Settlement may only be to increase efforts to control anti-Japanese movements and anti-Japanese terrorists.

Sanctions Against Anti-Japanese Elements Have Succeeded

Several sources pointed out that Japan has declared that it has no territorial ambitions in China other than to conquer China and confiscate Chinese property. However, Japan's current investment has not yet exceeded the British investment by a ratio of five to two. The Shanghai Municipal Council has taken active steps to control anti-Japanese terrorist activities. The results of these efforts have been considerable in controlling terrorist activities and sabotage in Japanese-occupied areas.

British Speculate on Japanese Intentions

The British believe that the Japanese complaint about unfair treatment by the Municipal Council's police department is the result of the Municipal Council's recent steps to improve the status and representation of Japanese in the police department not satisfying the Japanese. They recall that the Municipal Council has not yet met the Japanese demand for the number of police personnel. The fact that Japan failed to obtain a larger number of representatives in the recent Municipal Council elections has also been discussed here as a possible reason.

### Wenzhou Defense Commander Officially Approves the Resumption of Navigation to Wenzhou

Passengers Detained on the "Hana" Vessel Are Safe and Sound. The "Haifu" Vessel Postpones its Scheduled Trip to Dinghai, Seeking to Change the Date for Sailing to Wenzhou. Passengers from the "Deping" Vessel Disembark Before it Docks.

Following the concentration of Japanese warships in the waters off eastern Zhejiang, with apparent intentions, the Zhejiang military authorities, to strengthen defenses, temporarily prohibited navigation to all coastal ports. Now, with military deployments completed, in addition to approving the resumption of navigation on the Ningbo and Shanghai lines, foreign vessels are also permitted to resume navigation to Wenzhou. Yesterday, a Japanese warship detained the "Hana" vessel on the Shanghai-Dinghai line. As a result, the "Haifu" vessel decided to temporarily postpone its scheduled voyage to Dinghai. Gao Dengwei and Jin have been escorted to Shanghai. Details are as follows:

**Disembarkation of Personnel from the "Deping"**

The Italian company, Zhongyi Company's "Deping" vessel, specially chartered by the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo to handle emergency relief. After being blocked and returning to Shanghai, it was detained by a Japanese warship outside Wusongkou. Following negotiations by the Italian Consul General in Shanghai, it finally entered the port yesterday morning and berthed between buoys No. 20 and No. 21 in Yangshupu. As for the crew and passengers (including doctors and nurses sent to Ningbo), they were transported to the New Customs Wharf by small steamers yesterday afternoon to disembark. Dong Xinqin, a representative specially sent by the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, welcomed them. However, they were subjected to inspection by customs tax police upon landing. The company believes that the vessel has regained its freedom.

**"Hana" Forced to Stop Sailing to Dinghai**

After the "Hana" vessel of the German Far East Company in this port was approved by the Ningbo Defense Commander to resume navigation, the vessel departed from Shanghai for Dinghai at 4:00 PM yesterday. At 8:00 AM yesterday, when it sailed to the waters near Dinghai called "Bandaocha Ming Banhai" (lit. "Peninsula Fork Named Half Sea"), it was suddenly forced to stop sailing by a Japanese warship stationed in those waters. Japanese soldiers boarded the vessel for inspection, which had not been completed as of 6:00 PM yesterday. According to company sources, the vessel sent telegrams to Shanghai from time to time to report the situation. However, there is no confirmed news as to whether it can sail to Dinghai. The "Haifu" vessel, originally scheduled to sail to Dinghai yesterday, has also suspended its voyage and refunded tickets.

**Approval for Foreign Vessels to Resume Navigation to Wenzhou**

After the Wenzhou Defense Commander, acting on orders, notified on the 23rd of last month to temporarily prohibit foreign vessels from entering and leaving the Ou River, the loophole in the Ou River blockade had not yet been closed. Now, with the approval of Commander-in-Chief Liu via telegram to resume navigation to Wenzhou, in order to facilitate travel and promote cargo transport, foreign shipping companies, upon receiving the notice, immediately prepared to dispatch vessels to resume navigation to Wenzhou. The "Moufou" vessel of the German-Lihe Shipping Company, originally scheduled to clear customs yesterday and sail to Wenzhou this morning, has now temporarily changed its schedule to depart directly from Shanghai to Wenzhou tomorrow morning (the 6th).

**Gao Dengwei and Jin Escorted to Shanghai**

The "Gaodeng" vessel of the German Lulin Shipping Company, which operates on the Ningbo-Dinghai line, was detained by a Japanese warship in the Chuanshan waters on the 20th of last month after sailing from Dinghai to Ningbo. The Shanghai company had previously declared that the vessel had been released and berthed in Dinghai. However, according to confirmed information obtained by a reporter from the Xinxin News Agency, the "Gaodeng" vessel, under the surveillance of a Japanese warship, entered Wusongkou at around 7:00 AM yesterday and berthed at buoy No. 22 in Yangshupu. At the same time, the "Weijin" vessel of the German Hengshi Shipping Company, which operates on the Shanghai-Xinghua line, was detained in the Haimen waters of eastern Zhejiang and also escorted to Shanghai. Both vessels had Japanese flags hoisted on their masts. The "Gaodeng" vessel carried 73 passengers, and the "Weijin" vessel carried 12 passengers. All were released at 4:00 PM yesterday and sent to the New Customs Wharf by small steamers dispatched by the Japanese side. Both companies have reported the incident to the German Consulate, seeking negotiations with the Japanese side for their release. According to a passenger on the "Gaodeng" vessel who spoke to a reporter from the Xinxin News Agency, when the "Gaodeng" vessel sailed to the Chuanshan waters at around 10:00 AM on the 30th, it was searched by a Japanese warship. A young passenger in his twenties, wearing military attire, was detained by the Japanese army and transported to Shanghai by the Japanese warship.

### Refusal of Consular Body Against Paying Customs Duties with Counterfeit Currency

Rumor Says Customs Will Promulgate Regulations for the Use of Counterfeit Currency, but the American Chamber of Commerce Denies This Statement

According to the Continental News, it was learned from reliable sources last night (the 3rd) that negotiations are currently underway regarding the use of newly issued counterfeit currency to pay customs duties. This is a prelude to a major national controversy. It is revealed that the local Japanese authorities are exerting great pressure on relevant agencies, forcing customs to immediately use the currency of the Huaxing Commercial Bank, which is under Japanese control. However, it is heard that the consular body here is currently making

A Strong Opposition

A customs official acknowledged this matter yesterday. However, a well-known paper importer told a reporter that his customs broker had notified him in advance to immediately obtain the new counterfeit currency to pay his customs duties. The reporter further questioned other customs brokers, who stated that customs had not issued a formal notice, but they had received "verbal notice" that "in the near future," regulations regarding the use of

Counterfeit Currency Regulations

will be promulgated. Personnel from the American Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Commercial Counselor's Office also stated that they were unaware of this alleged action to be taken by customs. The so-called Huaxing Bank was officially established by the Japanese organizers and the Nanjing puppet regime on May 1st. Photos of the new counterfeit currency have been distributed in this port by Japanese photography companies, but the counterfeit currency

Has Not Yet Circulated

According to a statement issued by the Japanese who instigated the establishment of this new counterfeit institution, the bank's currency will be backed by legal tender. According to foreign banking circles in this port, the bank's purpose is to conspire to undermine the stability of the currency used as collateral. Furthermore, the English-language "Great American Evening News" stated that the claim in a certain morning newspaper that negotiations were underway regarding the use of the new "Hongkou currency" to pay customs duties could not be confirmed by the Shanghai Customs authorities, but

Customs Authorities

did not immediately deny this claim. Even if there are currently no negotiations regarding this matter, there is no doubt that the Japanese will use all their influence in the Jianghai Customs to ensure that customs at least accept the "Hongkou" currency as customs duties for Japanese foreign trade.

### Local Authorities Exert Efforts in Disaster Relief and Both Ningbo and Shaoxing Are Tranquil

Order Is Being Restored in the Ningbo Area, Banks and Money Shops Switch to Evening Business Hours

The urban area of Ningbo near Ling Bridge was bombed by Japanese aircraft three times on the 29th of last month and the 1st and 2nd of this month. The details have been reported in previous newspapers (the "Ningbo Bombed Again" news reported by this newspaper yesterday was the situation of the bombing on the 2nd). The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai received telegrams from the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and private individuals on the 1st and 2nd of this month, but there was no news on the 3rd and 4th, which caused considerable anxiety. Fellow villagers in Shanghai rushed to the association to inquire about the situation. Now, it is learned that the association managed to inquire about the truth of the situation in Ningbo via telegram yesterday afternoon.

Evacuate the population, business hours in the evening

A New Voice News Agency reporter learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the urban areas of Ningbo and Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang have been bombed by Japanese aircraft repeatedly. The Ningbo and Wenzhou-Taizhou defense commanders have ordered the evacuation of the urban population, and businesses have switched to evening business hours to avoid daytime bombing. The notice from the Ningbo Banking and Money Exchange Association is recorded as follows: "All members (banks) (money shops) will change their business hours from April 29th to 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM daily. Sundays will be closed as usual. This is a special notice. Please be informed."

Ningbo and Shaoxing are as peaceful as usual

In the past two days, rumors have been rife in Shanghai that war has broken out in Ningbo and that Shaoxing has been bombed by Japanese aircraft. Therefore, fellow villagers from Ningbo and Shaoxing in Shanghai have been inquiring with various fellow villagers organizations and shipping companies. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from relevant parties yesterday that a certain shipping company in Shanghai had communicated with Ningbo by telegram and learned that after Ningbo was bombed repeatedly, fortunately, the local authorities exerted efforts in disaster relief and handled the aftermath. Local order has been completely restored and is as peaceful as usual. As for the claim that Shaoxing was bombed, the telegram did not mention it, which is enough to prove that the bombing is unreliable. It is also heard that heavy troops have been stationed in the coastal area of eastern Zhejiang, with strict precautions. There are definitely no problems with the defense.

### Foreigners from Hankou After Arriving in Shanghai, Straight Out of Prison Get Released

Claiming that Freedom of Movement has been Lost in Hankou, the Suffering of the Chinese is Beyond Description

According to the Continental News, the British warship "Scorpion," carrying 43 foreigners from Hankou, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon. Their relatives and friends gathered at the wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to meet them. At about 4:00 PM, the warship berthed, and the foreigners disembarked one after another. According to a certain British expatriate among them, this arrival in Shanghai is like the release of prisoners. Others who described the situation in Hankou said that since residing in Hankou, they could not bear to stay any longer. The

Freedom of Movement

of foreigners and Chinese is still strictly restricted. Passports must be carried at all times. The Japanese treat foreigners of any nationality without much difference, but the treatment of Chinese is far from satisfactory. Outside of Hankou, in a state of chaos, farmers are robbed by the Japanese army and bandits, and their suffering is beyond description. Only farmers living far away from the Japanese military area and completely under the jurisdiction of the guerrillas,

Can Be Safe

It is said that ten foreigners from Hankou arrived on the British "Cricket" warship one hour after the "Scorpion" berthed. The "Cricket" has now completed its final service and will soon be dismantled.

### Rice Industry Meeting Today to Discuss Limiting Rice Prices

Hoping to Share the Burden of Difficulties and Maintain the People's Food Supply

Concession Authorities Concerned About the Livelihood of Civilians

The Public Concession Bureau of Public Works, in light of the fact that rice market transactions have suddenly exceeded the price limit in recent days, has attached great importance to the matter. They dispatched personnel to various groups yesterday to inquire about everything, hoping to assist in the food supply of the concession and maintain the status quo. Rice industry groups in this city have scheduled a joint meeting at 3:00 PM today to properly discuss solutions. The market situation yesterday morning was relatively stable, with a slight decrease in the number of transactions and a slight decrease in off-market prices. However, the publicly quoted price of the highest quality white japonica rice reached 15 yuan. Details of the situation are recorded as follows:

Concession Authorities Concerned About the People's Food Supply

The Bureau of Public Works of the Shanghai Public Concession and the Bureau of Directors of the French Concession are quite satisfied with the efforts of various rice industry groups to automatically limit market prices, investigate grain reserves, and dredge supply sources. They sent letters expressing their appreciation. However, in recent days, in view of the sudden increase in rice prices again, the buying and selling prices in the market have exceeded the price limit by more than one yuan. This phenomenon does not seem to benefit the citizens and is of great concern. They specifically dispatched personnel to groups such as the Bean and Rice Industry Association yesterday to inquire about the situation and verbally urged the leaders of each industry to quickly advise merchants to assist in the food supply of the concession and the livelihood of the poor, and to impose restrictions.

Rice Industry Joint Meeting to Discuss Solutions

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association will hold a joint meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon at the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange on 3rd floor, Rue Edouard VII, inviting the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association, Rice Milling Association, Changshu Rice Industry Association, Southern Helping Association, Rice Grain Merchants Association, and Rice Transporters Association to discuss important issues such as rice prices in Shanghai and dredging rice grain sources. All opinions put forward by merchants from various guilds have been reported by the Market Management Committee, and the recommendations of the Price Evaluation Committee have also been submitted to the joint meeting for detailed discussion to discuss proper solutions together.

Rice Grain Prices Reach 15 Yuan

From May 1st to 3rd, transactions in the rice industry market suddenly soared, even to the extent that the publicly quoted price of the highest quality white keng scented rice reached 15 yuan per stone. In addition, both buyers and sellers are engaged in off-market transactions at 400 to 500 coppers per stone. The number of transactions also increased dramatically, and the market was unprecedentedly turbulent. By the time the market opened yesterday morning, the situation had eased slightly, and off-market transactions had gradually subsided, not as sharp as in the past one or two days. The number of transactions opened up was limited, but the highest quality white keng scented rice still reached 15 yuan.

### Confirmation of the "Xinsheng" Vessel Being Detained and Forced to Sail to Taiwan

Negotiations by the Norwegian Consul General Are Still Ineffective

After the Norwegian vessel "Gong Sheng," represented by the Xinchang'an Company, and the Norwegian vessel "Baode," represented by the Taiping Shipping Company, were successively detained by Japanese warships and forced to sail to Taiwan, although the Norwegian Consul General in Shanghai protested to Japan, he was still unable to obtain the release of the vessels by the Japanese side. Now, it has been confirmed that the Norwegian vessel "Xinsheng," represented by the Fuan Company, which went missing after sailing from Shantou to Hong Kong on the 26th of last month, was detained by a Japanese warship outside Shantou and forced to sail to Taiwan. The agent notified the Cissen Company in Hong Kong and reported to the Norwegian Consul in Hong Kong, requesting negotiations with the Japanese side and requesting a speedy release.

### Marshal Joffre Vessel Arrives in Shanghai Today

The French postal vessel "Marshal Joffre" was damaged in a collision with the Great British Company's "Guangdong" vessel, which resulted in a lengthy stay in Hong Kong for repairs. It is now learned that the "Joffre" has left the dock and is coming to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in port at 1:00 PM today and berth at the Lao Ning Shao Wharf. It will carry 153 passengers and 90 bags of mail. It will stay in Shanghai for five days and is scheduled to depart on May 9th via Hong Kong, Saigon, Singapore, and Colombo, bound for Marseille, France.

### The Hog Industry Balances Meat Prices

The Maximum Price Must Not Exceed the Limits of the Public Resolution. Slaughterhouses Refuse to Slaughter Pigs from Unknown Sources.

The Fresh Pig Industry Association, after deciding on four measures to resolutely deal with the plundered fresh pigs, has caused the arrival of goods to decrease sharply and meat prices to soar. Yesterday, it issued a special notice to balance prices in order to maintain the people's food supply. The slaughterhouses in both concessions have refused pigs from unknown sources. The details are as follows:

Balance Market Prices

The industry association issued a notice yesterday balancing market prices, which stated, "For the purpose of notification, it has been found that the goods of this industry have recently been intercepted by the 'Livestock Market' in Hongkou, causing transporters to be discouraged and the source of goods to be lacking. If market prices are arbitrarily raised as a result, it would not be the intention of this industry to maintain meat food. Market prices should be balanced, and the highest price should not exceed the limits set by public resolution, in order to maintain the fairness of the trade in this industry and to care for the people's food. It is hoped that all businesses will share this intention and cooperate in handling this matter. This is the most important thing. This is a special notice."

Sharp Decline in Arrivals

A New Voice News Agency reporter learned from the fresh pig industry yesterday that only 52 pigs were loaded on the Tonghe vessel on the 3rd to meet the needs of the entire city, which is almost equal to zero. On the 4th, only 112 pigs were loaded on the Ruikang vessel, 342 pigs were loaded on the Hengxi vessel, and 377 necks of pigs were loaded on the Japanese Wanli Maru vessel. The total was only 800 pigs. The reason for this is that the goods arriving in Shanghai are often detained, and the goods are not controlled by the owners. Everyone is unwilling to sacrifice their capital for no reason. Therefore, the disruption of fresh meat in this city is caused by those who have repeatedly intercepted it.

Refusal to Slaughter

Slaughterhouses in both concessions have refused to accept pigs transported and slaughtered in the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou. For example, on May 3rd, several truckloads of pigs were transported to slaughterhouses in both concessions for slaughter. The slaughterhouses refused to accept them for slaughter because the source of the pigs was unknown. Also, the eight trainloads of pigs that were previously detained, totaling more than 400 pigs, were said to be returned on the night of the 3rd, but as of 5:00 PM on the 4th, they had not been returned. The reason given was that the prepayment of fees was rejected by the cargo owner, so the matter has not been resolved.

### Cai Renbao Resigns from Disaster Relief Post and the Authorities Persuade Him to Stay

Some Staff Unjustifiably Criticized Him, and the Authorities Are Determined Not to Let Him Withdraw

The person in charge of the refugee camps sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association is Mr. Cai Renbao, director of the association's office and general manager of the refugee camps. Mr. Cai is shrewd, decisive, and courageous in taking on tasks. Especially for the No. 1 refugee camp at the end of Datong Road and Dunning Road, his

Outstanding Achievements

Since its opening, which was only four months ago, he has carefully planned all the essential aspects of internal accommodation and management facilities and has done so in an orderly manner. For example, preparing children's education, training the skills of refugees, engaging in production, paying attention to fire prevention, and emphasizing hygiene and preventing diseases, etc. He has even set up a broadcasting room and entertainment room to regulate the spirit of the refugees and relieve their depression. All of these have been implemented without sparing any effort. In addition, the eight precepts he has personally set, such as not being partial, not protecting, not being selfish, not engaging in malfeasance, not drinking alcohol, not smoking, not gambling, and not fighting, can be practiced by him personally and serve as a model for all staff and refugees in the camp. Therefore, his staff and refugees can abide by the law and are able to see the subtle effects of the upper class leading the lower class and responding quickly to influence. Since the outbreak of the war, refugees in Shanghai have been as numerous as ants, and refugee camps throughout Shanghai have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, providing for the needs of this extraordinary period. If you want to find one that is second to none and is a model for all refugee camps, then it must be this one.

Reasons for Resignation

Unexpectedly, just as the camp was making steady progress, it was suddenly heard that Mr. Cai had the intention of retiring and had already expressed his resignation to the highest authorities of the association. The news spread, not only shocking the staff and refugees of the camp, but also surprising people in the community. A reporter specifically went to investigate the reasons for Mr. Cai's decision to resign yesterday and learned that the main reason was that some staff members were picking on small things and making unwarranted criticisms. Mr. Cai was leading the staff and working hard on the camp's affairs when he suddenly suffered this unexpected and unreasonable blow. The enthusiasm in his heart was greatly reduced. The so-called troublemakers were pulling his legs from behind. Mr. Cai felt that he was fulfilling his obligations entirely for the sake of society, but he was still facing this adversity. Therefore, in a fit of anger, he resolutely retired.

Sincere Retention

It is heard that all the staff members of the refugee camp have written to Mr. Cai, sincerely retaining him. It is also heard that the highest authorities of the association, Chairman Yu Qiaqing and Secretary-General Yuan Ludeng, and all the important committee members, attach great importance to Mr. Cai and are determined not to let him withdraw. They have strongly advised him to dispel his intention to resign. In addition, Mao Heyuan, a member of the Relief Committee, visited the Dunning Road refugee camp on the 2nd of this month and believes that the camp's various implementations were well-planned and that it was fortunate that someone was in charge. It is still necessary to continue to promote them. He also strongly advised Mr. Cai not to develop any intention to retire. After this strong retention, Mr. Cai may be able to change his mind and not be so determined to withdraw.

### The Japanese Government Will Continue to Issue Public Bonds for Many Years to Come

At Least 20 Billion Yuan Will Be Issued Annually, or 50 Billion Yuan Is Possible

The English-language "Great American Evening News" stated that the Japanese Minister of Finance, Ishiwata, declared at a meeting in Tokyo that even if the war in China could end in the near future, the Tokyo government would have to issue deficit bonds of at least 20 billion yen annually for many years to come. If the Sino-Japanese war continues to continue, the deficit issued by Japan

Will Inevitably Increase

to more than 40 billion yuan annually, or even 50 billion yuan is possible. The deficit in the Japanese budget continues to increase. It was found that in the first month of this year, the Japanese government's revenue was 225 million yuan less than its expenditures. The deficit for February of this year increased to 270 million yuan, the deficit for March increased to 310 million yuan, and the deficit for April is estimated by the

Bank of Japan

to be 480 million yuan. Therefore, the deficit for the first four months of this year has reached 1.285 billion yuan. During the same period, the new public bonds issued by the Sino-Japanese government exceeded this deficit, totaling 1.13 billion yuan. Japanese official reports claim that these public bonds have been fully absorbed, but in reality, the amount of these public bonds purchased by the Japanese public is

Less than Before

Forty-three percent of the new public bonds were taken over by the savings department of the Ministry of Finance, which forced Japanese savings banks to absorb them. The rest was taken over by the Bank of Japan, but it had no choice but to transfer a large portion of the new public bonds to other banks to absorb. As for individuals, there is little concern shown for increasing investment in national bonds.

### Lin Kanghou, Jiang Yiping, and Others Mediate Trademark Dispute

"For the treatment of gonorrhea, new medicines are emerging every day. Recently, Guanghua Pharmaceutical Factory has issued a bacterial preparation for internal use to treat gonorrhea, called '1919 Gonococcus Vaccine,' which is manufactured under the supervision of the Shanghai Special Zone Health Laboratory. After its release, because buyers can enjoy free inspection rights and because the drug is quite effective, the three-day special price attracted many buyers. However, the '919' trademark used by Guanghua was jointly registered earlier by Zhongfa Pharmacy when it released 914. Therefore, after Guanghua published the advertisement, Zhongfa immediately raised an objection, and a dispute arose between the two parties, which threatened to escalate. In the middle, Lin Kanghou, Jiang Yiping, Yuan Hesong, Tu Kaiwei, Gao Peiliang, and Zhu Yuquan took on the task of mediation and, from a friendly standpoint, traveled between the two parties to reconcile. The principals of Guanghua and Zhongfa also expressed their understanding and were willing to respect the opinions of the mediators. It was decided that Guanghua would change the name of Gonococcus Vaccine to '161' for future distribution. Thus, a dispute came to an end, and peace was restored."

### Wang Hongzhu, a Japanese Military Agent in Suzhou, Was Shot Dead

While Sipping Tea in the Xuyuan Teahouse, He Was Suddenly Attacked by Two People with Guns.

According to a person from Suzhou who came to Shanghai, Wang Hongzhu, a native of Wuxi, was 34 years old (originally named Liu Zhongquan, he married into the Wang family). Before the August 13th Incident, he worked in a silk factory outside Panmen, Suzhou, for more than ten years. Due to commercial contacts, he developed a close relationship with the Japanese side. When Suzhou was about to fall, he immediately joined the Inoue Unit of the Japanese Army as an interpreter, extorting money everywhere and setting up "comfort women stations" in the city. Therefore, he was extremely favored by Inoue, who appointed him as a special agent and secret detective. After accepting the puppet "order," Wang became even more unscrupulous, framing good people. Several guerrillas were also sacrificed because he reported them to the Japanese army. Therefore, the guerrillas had long wanted to kill Wang to eliminate harm to the country. On the morning of the day before yesterday (the 2nd), Wang was sipping tea alone in the Xuyuan Teahouse in Yangyu Lane when he was suddenly attacked by two people with guns. Wang was shot dead on the spot, and the attackers calmly escaped. The order was chaotic for a while. After hearing the alarm, the Japanese garrison immediately sent a large number of Japanese soldiers to suppress the situation. On the one hand, they paid 300 yuan to "comfort" the family of the deceased and hastily collected Wang's body. Since this incident occurred, a state of tension has suddenly reappeared in Suzhou. The Japanese and puppet forces are uneasy.

### Qing Yu Li Tenants Petition the Two Chinese Directors Again

Since the relocation issue occurred in Qing Yu Li on New Chongqing Road, all tenants have been very anxious. They have sent representatives to various groups for assistance for several days. Yesterday, they again conducted petitions in groups. The Ningbo group, represented by Ni Yuncong and Lu Weizhang, petitioned Yu Qiaqing of the Relief Association for a second time. They were received and Yu agreed to mediate. The manufacturers' group, represented by Zhang Mulian, petitioned Ai Ludeng of the Taxpayers' Association, who also agreed to seek special accommodation from the authorities. The three thousand-plus tenants were comforted by the two elders and their worried brows were slightly smoothed. A telegram was sent to the Chongqing headquarters, urging Yu Hede, the chairman of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, to dissuade the relocation nearby. A letter was also sent to Fei Xindun, the General Manager of the Public Works Department, to notify the Water Company to temporarily suspend water supply to avoid disorder. The three thousand tenants of the Qing Yu Li also appointed representatives, Zhou Xiang Sheng and thirty others, to petition the First Special District Court. Furthermore, the Shanghai Women's Commercial & Savings Bank also issued a statement regarding this case, stating briefly that the bank leased all the land and buildings of Qing Yu Li, New Chongqing Road, owned by the Poor Children's Education Institute on November 6, 1933, and signed a lease, which was filed under Non-Character No. 101 in the First Special District Local Court. Article 6 of the lease stipulated that a one-year rent of 49,000 yuan and a deposit of 49,000 yuan should be prepaid to the Education Institute at the time of signing the lease. If all the houses in the Qing Yu Li are not renovated within five years, all the funds will be confiscated, and the obligations and conditions of the contract cannot be waived.

### Sausage Industry Association Establishes Preparatory Committee

The Shanghai pig and sheep casing industry occupies an important position as an export commodity. German, British, French, American, and Russian merchants have established factories in Shanghai to purchase casings. Except for a few foreigners, the rest are Chinese. There is usually a lack of liaison organizations, so public welfare undertakings such as schools, orphan care, material assistance, medical care, and disaster relief cannot be carried out. Now, Wang Zhi Zheng, the owner of Yi Xing Intestine Factory, together with colleagues in the industry, initiated the Shanghai Sausage Industry Association. No matter whether Chinese or foreign factories, owners, or partners, all can join the association. The other day, a meeting of colleagues in the industry was convened, and many people attended. It was resolved on the spot to establish a preparatory committee and elect Wang Zhi Zheng and four others as members of the preparatory committee, and Wang Zhi Zheng was elected as chairman of the association.

### Min Yi Pharmaceutical Factory, Enthusiastic Subscription by All Circles

Since the Min Yi Pharmaceutical Factory publicly offered shares, subscriptions from all circles have been very enthusiastic. The factory's output target is mainly synthetic chemicals, industrial raw material injection preparations, and special drugs. This is in line with the general trend of national industries to move forward. Therefore, investing in this business is indeed more profitable and secure than storing money in a bank, and each share is only 20 yuan, which is an easy matter. As a result, the number of people requesting charters and subscribing for shares has been very large recently. The preparation office of the pharmaceutical factory is located inside the Zhongxi Pharmacy on Fourth Malu Road.

### Japanese Free Action, Arresting Three Russians, Reason Unknown, Two Released

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that a Russian was arrested by the Japanese army in Shanghai five weeks ago and is still being detained. Two other Russians were also arrested, but were released after being arrested for a month. There is no clear reason for the arrest of the three. It was found that the Japanese army arrested them on March 29 in a house on Yangshupu Road and押赴 百老滙大厦 (translated as "Broadway Building"). The Japanese army did not ask the police for cooperation, but acted freely in the Public Concession. The three Russians were Boris Sofovsky, the Sige of the Chinese Timber Import and Export Company (translated meaning) on Yangshupu Road, Korinichu, an employee of a certain company, and Siglov, who was unemployed. Mr. Xi is still being detained. Bao and Ke were released on April 28. It is said that Ruoju did not know why he was arrested. The Japanese army treated him well and was interrogated. The question was about their political intentions. The Japanese army arrested them because they had obtained some mysterious information from the Japanese Consulate. In the past few days, rumors about these three Russians have spread in Shanghai, saying that they were allowed by the Pudong guerrillas to land on the property they were guarding, so they were arrested by the Japanese army. This statement seems to be purely nonsense. The only explanation is that someone held a grudge against them and fabricated information to the Japanese Consul-General, who told the Japanese army, who arrested them without notifying the工部局.

One is at 368 Haige Road, and the other is at 478 Yuyuan Road. The above two gambling dens are currently being renovated day and night and will officially open soon. The gambling den on Yuyuan Road was originally intended to lease a residence of a director of a certain bank (that is, a certain person whose son was attempted to be kidnapped by kidnappers a month ago, resulting in a shootout), but it was not realized due to obstruction. It was not until recently that the house was changed to operate a gambling den.

This kind of gambling is the so-called Guangdong-style white pigeon ticket gambling. The number is currently under construction, and soon the magic cave that harms people will increase.

It is said that Mr. Ke is a native of Scotland and has been serving in the Police Department for about ten years. He has a wife and two children, and now lives in Shanghai.

### The Effectiveness of "Insurance Pills"

Report from the Central Pharmaceutical Research Institute According to a telegram from Kunming on the 29th, after the Central Pharmaceutical Research Institute moved to Yunnan last year, in view of the fact that China's wound medicine has always relied on foreign countries, which is very uneconomical during this period of resistance against Japan, and that Yunnan's medicinal materials such as "Insurance Pills," "Yu Gang San," and "Bai Yao" have always been reputable in wound medicine, all medicines have been studied in detail, and the results have been obtained, and their effectiveness is considered to be extremely good. Liu Shaoguang, the director of the institute, especially invited people from all walks of life to make a public report on the research results today, recognizing that insurance pills are the main medicine for paralyzing the parasympathetic nervous system, and their value is above belladonna and mother-of-pearl. They are of great help for wound relief, alcohol prohibition, and quit悶, and can replace imported products atropine and scopolamine.

### Wife of Coal Boat Boss砍斃 by Boat Partner

When the Husband Returned to the Boat, She Was Already Dead, The Police of the Two Concessions Strictly Arresting the Murderer

Zhu A Gen from Ningbo, who is 21 years old this year, works as the boss on the No. 658 coal boat at the Xin Sanjing Coal Warehouse Wharf in Pudong. His wife, Ms. Chuan, who is 26 years old this year, is from the same hometown as Zhu and lives with Zhu on the boat. There are also two boat partners, Shi Gen Qing (31 years old, from Chongming) and Chen Rong Qing (24 years old, from Ningbo), who also live on the boat. In the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, Zhu and Chen Rong Qing left the boat and went ashore due to an incident, leaving only Zhu's wife, Ms. Fu, and boat partner Shi Gen Qing on the boat. At about 3:00 p.m., Shi took advantage of the fact that there was no one on the boat and suddenly took an axe to the bedroom of the old couple at the stern of the boat,砍 the head of Zhu Fu氏 five times. At that time,氏猝 was unable to躲避 and任猛砍. Because it was in the brain, he immediately fell into a pool of blood and died. Shi went ashore and escaped. When氏's husband Zhu A Gen and partner Chen Rong Qing returned to the boat, they discovered it.氏's body was already cold. They reported to the Water Patrol Police Station, and Western探目亞樂富生 (translated as "Alepusheng") led Chinese探 and others to inspect the scene. Yesterday, the body was transported by a small boat to the public wharf outside Xiaodongmen in the French Concession. The French Police Station was reported and the body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall to inspect the body, and reported to the Second Special District Court today to send personnel to inspect it. On one side, the Mountain Water Patrol Police Station consulted the police stations in the British and French concessions to assist in sending探 to investigate and arrest the fugitive murderer. It is said that the reason why氏 was killed was due to rape, and the truth remains to be verified.

Spring and Autumn

### Students in Sichuan

— New Dream

Life is simple, like monks in a monastery. From sunrise to sunset, they work tirelessly. Not afraid of bombing, they have built their own air-raid shelters. Classes are called by bugle, filling the atmosphere with a military spirit.

Half of China's educational institutions have been destroyed by Japanese bombs, and are now in ruins. The remaining buildings have been occupied by Japanese troops. The books and equipment that remain have either been looted or burned.

They have destroyed universities and higher schools, but Chinese education is progressing, and the government and those who promote education are working harder than ever before.

"When I saw Japanese bombs destroy our campus like falling rain," said President Jia Lun of Central University to foreign reporters, "I vowed that for every school building they destroyed, we would build two; for every hour they killed, we would produce more than ten. This is our answer to Japan's destruction of our universities."

This indomitable spirit has been demonstrated by the Animal Husbandry Department of Central University, spreading throughout the country and slowly moving inland. Teams of cattle, sheep, and pigs were driven inland, traversing hundreds of miles, and finally arrived at their intended destination after a year, without losing a single animal.

Central University spent forty-two days building a new campus on the outskirts of Chongqing. The entire structure consists of more than fifty houses, arranged to accommodate the three thousand students and faculty who moved from Nanjing to the interior.

The school buildings and dormitories are built on the slopes of the mountains beside the Jialing River. They are rough wooden houses, but simple and clean. Students adapt to their surroundings, living a frugal and simple life. It is said that each student spends no more than two hundred and fifty yuan per year.

Students without money - refugees from the war zone - do not have to worry about tuition fees. The clever ones have scholarship amounts, and others can receive a monthly loan of eight yuan, six yuan for food, and two yuan for miscellaneous expenses - all they need.

A thousand students can dine in a cafeteria, with two sets of rough bowls and plates, and large buckets filled with steamed rice placed in the aisles of the dining hall. The simple life of these young students is comparable to that of monks living in a monastery.

However, life at the university is very peaceful, and students work tirelessly from sunrise to sunset. In small factories, they work with machines and tools snatched back from the Japanese. In the art room, some students are painting propaganda murals. Colorful and vivid pictures hang on the walls, serving as decorations for the studio. At the foot of Songshan (translator), new houses are being built quickly, which is the new campus of Central University, preparing to accommodate more new students next semester.

According to the Chinese government's external claims: Since the outbreak of the war, it has spent five million yuan to relieve 55,000 students, 15,000 university professors, teachers, and educators who have lost their jobs due to the war. According to the latest news released by the Ministry of Education: Among the higher schools destroyed by Japan in the war zone, 53 have been moved to the interior, part of the schools have been moved to the interior are 17, in addition, there are two schools that are moving to the interior, and eight are still active in the Japanese-occupied areas.

At the same time, the Ministry of Education also announced that since the outbreak of the war, five new universities and technical schools have been added in the interior; before the war, there were only eight higher schools in those places. Now Sichuan, among the inland provinces, has the largest number of schools moving from the war zone.

Like Central University, Tianjin's Nankai University also moved to the interior. However, the principal of the school, Zhang Boqin, and his colleagues, had a more distant vision than other educators, they had already seen when Japan invaded North China. In 1936, a year before the Lugou Bridge Incident, a new campus had already been selected.

Construction work also began with a funding of five hundred thousand yuan, of which fifty thousand yuan was donated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. A year later, the war broke out, and their school was completely destroyed by Japanese incendiary bombs, they traveled a thousand miles to Sichuan. Now there are one thousand and four hundred students studying at Nankai, two-thirds of whom fled from the war zone, and they have witnessed their schools and homes destroyed by the Japanese. These male and female students are extremely patriotic and are able to fulfill their duties for the welfare of the country. During the recent donation competition, these young citizens took out 17,000 yuan from their own pockets to contribute to the country.

The exterior of the entire campus looks like a military camp, and every student, regardless of gender, wears a uniform. Female students in uniform are rigorously drilled on the playground. Male students in military uniforms gather together and are taught by an officer how to fire Chinese-made machine guns. Others play basketball and football on the large playground. The bugle replaces the bronze bell to call students into the classroom, making the atmosphere of this school even more filled with military spirit.

Although Central University and Nankai are far from the city, they are not afraid of Japanese planes bombing, and both schools have built their own air-raid shelters. At Nankai, they even have their own alarm. Japanese planes used to bomb their original school, leaving a deep impression on the students. Young people are enthusiastically fond of aviation, and most study aviation subjects. Among the Chinese Air Force, sixty aviators were formerly graduates of Nankai.

"When China sees peace again," said President Luo, "we will return to Nanjing." But all these universities and higher schools must remain in the interior. China's educational institutions will be twice as many as before the Sino-Japanese war.

### Bombing

— Buddha

The people who are fighting in the war are naturally not afraid of airplanes and bombs, but the people who are most afraid of airplanes and bombs are civilians, and they have to bomb our civilians. I don't know what hatred they have with our people! To resort to such inhuman means?

Many of their soldiers have amulets from certain shrines around them. I guess their meaning is nothing more than to ask the gods to bless them. I don't know if the gods are willing to protect these cruel soldiers. There are still problems in between.

Assuming that the gods are truly effective, I think there must be those who will be punished by them.

### Impressions of "[Female Warriors]"

— Li Zhihua

The First Soviet Color Film Opens at the Shanghai Guangda Theater

It was "A Life of One's Own" that laid the foundation for Soviet films in front of Chinese audiences. That's not because "A Life of One's Own" was the first film to open in China, but because of its grand and broad style; this style would have influenced Hollywood, and the Chinese film industry, which was in its infancy, was even more affected.

Now it is Aik Yagnukovich's first film after A Life of One's Own, "The Nightingale Song" (now translated as "Female Warriors") has come to China; like "A Life of One's Own" as the first sound film in the Soviet Union, this "Female Warriors" is the first color film in the Soviet Union. Although its protagonist has only red and blue colors, so that it cannot transmit all the colors of objects in layers, especially in action, the colors appear a bit blurred, but like those static pictures, such as the introduction of several landscapes and the roses in the vase, its beauty is actually not much less than that of the American technicolor film. In other scenes, such as the scene where the fire is extinguished, the raging flames and his shadow also have great achievements in photography technology.

The director's skills are also superior, especially the "weaving connection" in each scene. We can cite many admirable places. For example: the new factory is completed, the female workers are forced to participate in the celebration ceremony, and Grugniang presents a scene in which there is a vase with the factory owner's portrait. Aik used a close-up of the dog to represent the expression of the foreman. He used it very appropriately. Also, for example: a labor strike breaks out, and it is assumed that Grugniang goes to the roof to send a signal. Grugniang is shot in the arm, struggling to bandage the wound with a headscarf, and the blood comes out and dyes the headscarf red. When she arrives at the roof, she uses this blood flag as a writing signal. This cleverness is also admirable, and the gradual increase of the blood stains after being shot is much more real and powerful than the close-up of a large pile of blood after being shot in general Hollywood movies; also, the enjoyable scene of the female workers attacking with porcelain, whether it is in the country or its atmosphere, is definitely not comparable to an American movie. We can cite many similar examples, but for the sake of space, we can only omit them.

The story of "Female Warriors" is a historical fact from 1910 to 1921 during the "eve of the revolution. This is one of many heroic revolutionary labor strikes. Although there is a little modification, it is still very real in general.

The meaning of this film in the Soviet Union and in China is certainly different. So, what will it make us get when it opens here at this time? That is to say, what is its objective effect?

A friend said to me after seeing those queens being forced to wear new clothes (the fabric was pre-issued, and the cost was deducted from the salary) singing and presenting vases to celebrate the completion of the new factory, that this reminded him of the "celebratory style" brought by certain "funny characters"; however, what moved me more was the heroic female workers' decision to use the porcelain on their hands as a weapon of attack, and the pilot's use of his unparalleled courage to send the gendarmes on the "road of no return." This is a lesson of blood, and also a living textbook, even if they have no weapons, the brave masses with consistent steps, using the tools in their hands, will eventually defeat their enemies!

Ivanseiva's singing voice is better than her acting skills, and she is better at acting in joyful scenes than in sad scenes. Adarov, who plays the factory owner, and Ke Kogov, who plays the foreman, have good results, especially Adarov. He performed very commendably in the scene where the new factory was completed.

Dare to introduce this Soviet color film to dear readers, not only because this is the first Soviet color film, which can be used as a lesson for those who are interested in film art, but mainly for the living lessons here.

The newsreel "Jewish Autonomous Region" before the feature film is also worth seeing.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 9: Bearing Sorrow and Suffering, Tears Sprinkled in All Directions, Practicing Thrift and Labor, Hard Work in Ten Acres

At that time, there will be so many people from all over the world who come to China. To see how far China has progressed, but we can't travel all over China at once, we can show them movies. So at that time, we will also build a large cinema in the world sports meeting hall. But those are all things for next year, and this year is already starting to brew up. Today, the newsreels being shown at Soochow University are mostly about academics. There are also a few landscape films, all of which are in color. There have been quite a few short films about public welfare undertakings recently. Even the nursery that Zhu Ai and others set up, because of the three little angels, many film companies want to ask for the movie to be taken. But Dr. Lao Zhang didn't want to publicize it. They all declined them. Even so, the newsreel to be sent to the New York World's Fair will praise the success of China's nursery undertakings, and because of these triplets, I am afraid that they will still come to take pictures. The director of the Central Film Bureau has already asked Dr. Lao Zhang, and they are now in contact. In addition, Dr. Lao Zhang has many friends in the United States, and they all want to see the results of this nursery, and Dr. Lao Zhang can't refuse, right? At this moment, the two sisters Wu Junsu are accompanying Zhu Ai, Jin Danyu, and the two sisters He, etc., and after they have finished their meal, they come to the theater. The theater is already full of people, and at 7:45, the newsreel will be shown first. After about an hour, take a short break, and then the drama begins. First, a director, Mr. Yu, walked to the front of the stage and said a few humble words. The general idea is: There are many improper and imperfect places in the play, and I ask you to give your advice so that it can be improved. This director, Mr. Yu, is also a veteran in the drama world. He is now only in his forties, and in his youth, he really suffered a lot to arouse the people to engage in the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, he was also a film worker. China's film industry before the war was really very immature. Anyone who has acted in a movie in the film industry and is slightly famous is called a movie star. Especially female actors, as long as they appear on the screen, they are a movie star. At that time, although Mr. Yu was a male actor, he was also called a star. The country they were non-existent were all ambitious young people, in addition to movies, they also acted in dramas. On the eve of August 13, 1937, they were performing a highly inflammatory drama called "Defend Lugou Bridge," but they did not expect that tomorrow Shanghai would launch a louder cannon sound than Lugou Bridge.

### Those Who Gain the Dao Receive Much Help

— Mao Lie

The international vertical and horizontal maps are based on interests, and will not be confined to morality. However, justice is in the hearts of the people, and the influence of morality does exist: for countries with the Dao, if it is beneficial to themselves, they will of course do their best to help them, even if it is not beneficial to themselves, but it is not harmful (countries with the Dao are naturally not harmful to others), at least they will adhere to strict neutrality and will not kick them when they are down, or help the wicked to do evil.

The aid of Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union to China can be attributed to the former, and the fact that other countries in the world, except for one country that invaded China, do not aid China, but do not necessarily oppress China, can be attributed to the latter. There is no other reason for this, because China is an innocent victim, and an aggressor. China is fighting, struggling; China's experiences are moving and sympathetic, and China's actions are in accordance with the will of heaven and the people. In other words, China has gained the Dao: those who gain the Dao receive much help; when help is great, the world will naturally return to it! Even Germany, which breathes with the aggressor, once signed mutually beneficial commercial treaties with China. The extent of China's assistance can be seen from this point.

Recently, in addition to Britain's continued active assistance to China, which is often criticized by a certain party, the United States has even more explicit expressions. According to the Hawass Agency in Washington, at a sudden meeting of the National Commercial Federation of the United States, some people even said, "When necessary, we will not hesitate to resort to war." They are very willing for China to "maintain its independent sovereignty" and become their "future primary customer," so they want to protect trade with China and not be blockaded by any aggressor. They have complete sympathy for China's resistance.

At the same time, the remarks made by the U.S. Ambassador to China, Johnson, in San Francisco are also of great help to China. He believes that "China has abundant food and clothing, and the people's morale is extremely high," and believes that "Japanese aircraft arbitrarily bomb the centers where Chinese people live, which only makes the Chinese people's hatred of Japan increase." The Chinese people, in the environment of continuous bombing in Ningbo and Chongqing, will probably not only feel emotional when they see this kind of talk, but will be grateful! China's pain is of concern to others, and this concern comes from complete understanding and goodwill.

However, China can take pride in the assistance of other countries, but it cannot relax because of it. "Heaven helps those who help themselves" can be changed to "People help those who help themselves." China should continue to strive in justice and exhaust every bit of its self-help power!

### Fire

— Li Qiao

—Memories of Breaking Through from Xuzhou—

Watching the unquenchable fire greedily devour Xusan Village, several old people who hadn't escaped were wailing and struggling in the sea of flames. My heart felt pierced, and I couldn't help but feel resentful.

"Good, burn it well, blood debts must be paid with blood debts!"

Night fell, and gusts of evening wind blew, making the sea of flames even more turbulent and roaring. Black smoke billowed in clumps, and the flames rose higher, licking at the sky… Even the sky seemed licked and fiery red.

The troops, already trapped in the enemy's encirclement, gathered outside the village, distributing the mortar shells they couldn't carry. Then, along a soft dirt road, they marched forward in a mighty formation. The yellow dust rose terribly, choking people, who coughed incessantly. The cavalry, moving alongside the队伍, stirred up a cloud of dust, rudely rushing ahead. People walked rapidly, one after another. Sometimes, when the distance between them grew too large, they broke into a run to catch up.

Having walked more than ten li, they looked back at Xusan Village: the sea of flames was still turbulent and roaring, frighteningly so!

Night enveloped the earth, and no one knew where they were. The road was so uneven, but their feet seemed to know it well, taking large strides forward.

We arrived at a town, no one knew what it was called, completely destroyed by enemy aircraft, and not a single civilian in sight. As they stepped over the rubble through this desolate, lifeless town, a remaining house was still emitting black smoke, but no one came to save it; the fire greedily burned on.

Everyone's hearts were filled with resentment, sorrow… Silently, they just walked on the endless road.

Ahead was a frighteningly red glow of fire, making the dark sky seem so bright and clear that some small villages, swallowed by darkness, were also clearly visible.

Following the road, toward that red target, they arrived beside the sea of flames, only to see another village destroyed!

"Ah, you insane bandits, this hatred cannot be forgotten! Your brutality will not destroy China, but will only hasten your own demise!" People walked on ceaselessly. Those overcome by sleepiness simply ran to the fields, to the side of the road, heedless of everything, and fell asleep haphazardly, but most of the troops continued to move forward.

It seemed endless, passing one village after another. Their aching feet felt too weak to lift, and they were desperately thirsty, but they still had to walk.

Day broke, and they hoped the campsite would be arriving soon. Exhausted and barely able to continue, they mustered the last of their strength and walked forward, hoping to satisfy their unbearable hunger and thirst at the campsite. But by ten o'clock, the campsite at Tuzhuang was still nowhere to be seen.

"Alas, this is exhausting!"

"Walk, what else can we do but walk?"

The road was littered with stragglers, walking aimlessly. Arriving at Jiagou Town, they hoped at least to get a drink of water even if there was no food, but found it had already been bombed flat by enemy aircraft.

With disappointed hearts and dragging their limp feet, they stumbled to Jiagou Station on the Jinpu Railway. Here, a dead train was still parked, filled with goods, luggage, and two machine guns and a lot of bullets.

The station seemed deserted, chillingly so. As they stepped across the Jinpu Railway, just as they were about to walk forward, a fierce cannonade suddenly erupted from the top of the mountain ahead:

—Boom!

—Boom!

But we ignored it and continued toward our destination.

### Aiming (Woodcut)

— Su Li

### Afterthoughts

— Editor

I fully agree with Mr. Bai Ying's opinions on translation work. Indeed, there are many people engaged in translation now, but inevitably there is a lot of wasted effort and resources without a corresponding increase in efficiency. If there were a liaison organization for common discussion, I think there would certainly be much progress. I hope Mr. Bai Ying will be willing to be the initiator of this, and that all those engaged in translation will join.

### We are Young People

— Bing Quan

Now, surging before my eyes are countless faces of young people, as red as fire, joyful, and pure; the backdrop to these many faces is the wide expanse of the wilderness, the domed, deep blue sky. Voices filled with vitality and enthusiastic passion are shouted from their mouths, spreading across this great field… Gradually, they all disperse, rushing like wildfire to burn in another corner, but the echo of their voices still reverberates clearly, lingering.

I sink into a sweet fantasy.

The sound of the door shatters my peaceful dream. A young person, just like me, comes in. The passionate radiance has vanished from his face, replaced by a desolate shadow of misery.

Neither of us speaks, silently sitting across from each other. We just listen to the sound of time's footsteps steadily fading away, far off but also seemingly very near. Finally, he opens his mouth.

I am sensitively thinking of other things, only seeing his lips moving vaguely up and down; but without even hearing his voice, I can understand what he is saying, because I have heard it countless times. He is telling of his pain.

"You are in pain, aren't you?" I say.

"Yes…"

"…"

"Aren't you the same as me?" he says agitatedly.

Yes, I am just as much in pain as him! We sit quietly facing each other again. But when a small spark—a spark of life—ignites deep within my heart, I break the threat of silence, leaping up suddenly:

"Of course, some other brothers are living a more joyful and great life than us; we are thrown into the dark wilderness. But does that mean we should despair, should we let ourselves rot away?... No, we cannot!..."

He is startled for a moment. He grasps my hand tightly. I see two streaks of hot tears shining in his eyes, and a rosy color quickly outlines a clear contour on his cheeks.

"People with life and faith will never rust in a damp, bad environment. We must fight strongly!" A clear voice rings out loudly.

### Talking About Translation Work

— Bai Ying

—Suggestions to Translators—

In the Shanghai publishing industry in the past year, there has been a noteworthy phenomenon: the flourishing of translation work. Almost every newspaper and magazine has translated works. In some publications, translations account for a considerable amount in terms of both quantity and quality, and among single-volume books, translated works are probably more "bestselling" than original creations. Many newspapers even have special columns dedicated to translations.

If we frankly admit that China's modern culture is relatively backward, this phenomenon is a very fortunate one. Moreover, translation work is a very important and essential task for cultural exchange. Especially in today's war of resistance, it can provide us with spiritual and practical assistance (such as intelligence) in terms of foreign sympathy and opinions toward China, accurate analysis of the international situation, on-the-spot reports from foreign war correspondents and observers, and foreign-collected historical materials on the war of resistance. And the texts introduced by Shanghai translators mostly fall within the above scope.

Some say that translation work is simply to make clothes for others, as if anyone who understands a foreign language can easily do it. But I think translation work is not that simple. Setting aside the various technical aspects, the translator's own thoughts are a prerequisite for the practical value of their work. Merely possessing linguistic skills without a correct consciousness means that the translated work introduced cannot be correct either. Puppet newspapers and magazines also publish translations, and most of them are readable in terms of language, but they are still puppet work. Therefore, the translator's ideological problem is the prerequisite for determining the value of their translation.

The next point is the translator's knowledge. Although knowledge includes translation skills, knowledge is not just skills. This is especially true for translators. Other specialized technicians are also experts in the knowledge of their field, such as civil engineers and electrical engineers, whose knowledge can be specialized in the field of their skills. Translators can also specialize in literature, politics, economics, science, or other categories. However, in the current situation, translators must temporarily assume the role of Mlinister at large in the cultural world. This can be attributed to the objective needs of society and the personal life problems of translators. Therefore, current translators should strive to improve their knowledge. Like a diplomat's Minister at Iarge, even if they cannot achieve a "deep" understanding in terms of knowledge, they must at least have a certain degree of "breadth." Technical problems can also be decided on the basis of this "breadth."

The above two points are the most basic conditions for translators outside of linguistic skills. Currently, there are quite a few people engaged in translation work in Shanghai. In terms of ideology, judging by the principle of "resistance against Japan as the top priority," the general situation is satisfactory. However, the viewpoints are somewhat too biased. For example, the works of Snow and his wife, Smedley, Bertram, and other famous foreign writers are translated by everyone as soon as they are published. (For example, Bertram's "North China Front" is reportedly being translated by five parties.) This phenomenon has both advantages and disadvantages: on the one hand, it shows that translators have a correct perspective, but beyond the ideological perspective, there is probably also a business perspective, and the result is a waste of energy and resources. In fact, in addition to the works of established writers in China, there are many other good works, but translators lack contact, so everyone's eyes are only focused on a few famous writers, and they neglect others, even repeatedly reheating the same dish in newspapers and magazines. To correct this phenomenon, the fundamental solution is to have a liaison organization among translators. In terms of knowledge, one person is never as good as the power of the group. Even as a Minister at Iarge, one cannot be a jack of all trades. The standardization of specialized names, and the discussion of translations all require mutual research and discussion among translators.

Due to space limitations, I cannot say everything at once. But if we acknowledge that translation work at this stage is a component of the entire war of resistance culture, then for the sake of the complete development of translation work, it is necessary for translators to establish a mutual aid organization.

### Four Hundred Million Compatriots Opens in America

— (Chan)

The film "Four Hundred Million Compatriots," which recently opened in a famous New York theater, caused a sensation throughout the city of New York. It was almost sold out every show for two weeks.

This film records everything about China's war of resistance: life on the front lines, and the situation in the rear, all vividly captured on camera. The producer is the very experienced Joris Ivens, who three years ago gained fame for his newsreel "The Spanish Earth," and is one of the most famous newsreel photographers in America.

The making of this film was very difficult. In China, Joris discovered that the materials he needed were scattered everywhere. He had to travel at least eighty miles every day. In Spain, he only needed to stay in a hotel in Madrid, and upon hearing the sound of gunfire, he could set off and be on the front lines with his camera within fifteen minutes. But in China, the battlefield was so vast and distant that it often took a week to find a good piece of material. The footage of the great battle of "Recapturing Taierzhuang" was also obtained with great effort and at great risk.

When the film was publicly screened in New York this past March, he was invited by newspaper reporters to talk about his work and impressions. The following is an excerpt from his report:

'...Regarding China, many Americans only know that it is a vast and boundless land inhabited by countless hardworking people. Therefore, the first purpose of my making this film was to go deep into the interior of China and bring back some real things, so that audiences could see the true face of China, their leaders and people, and their heroic stance in this war of resistance, and sweep away the general public's superficial view of China. I can believe that my filming of this film was not a failure. Audiences will be amazed and excited after seeing the heroic battles of the Chinese people in this film, and they will overturn their old prejudices... Everything in this film is without pretense. I have recorded the truth...'

Incidentally, the narration for this film is performed by the famous star Fredric March.

### Film World News

— (Yan)

Zhang Shankun went to Hong Kong on the morning of the 4th, and will come to Shanghai again with Chen Yunshang to make films. Li Zulai, an advisor to Yi Hwa Film Company, is on the same flight.

The success of Jin Cheng's "Tears of Song" is the first film since "Meng Jiangnu" to achieve such high box office results. Many Westerners have gone to see it in recent days because of the excellence of the film's songs and music.

The Hong Kong-made Mandarin film "A Generation of Great People" has been previewed and the results are very good. The screening rights have been won by Jin Cheng.

Chen Yanyan is busy again. After "The Story of the Pipa," she will continue to star in "The Mad Woman's Strange Fate." This "Miss" doesn't get busy often, but when she does, she is amazing.

Yuan Meiyun's "Transformation Girl" Parts Three and Four started production at the same time, which is a good omen.

Director Wu Cun has made a lot of works in the past six months. It is said that this is his way of expressing his loyalty to the company's authorities, but he will take a rest in the second half of the year.

Wang Yin is directing "Desperate Fugitives," with Zhou Shimu as the cinematographer. Zhou previously helped Yao Su Feng a lot with "Youth Line."

Zhou Xuan's performance in the scene where Li Sanniang gives birth in the mill in "Li Sanniang" is wonderful. The screenwriter is Li Changjian, and the fact that a Li is writing a play about a Li is sure to add extra humor.

Xu Qinfang has recently added another title: "Mysterious Lady," as this is the name of the play she recently starred in.

Bai Yang sent a letter to the famous sound engineer He Zhaozhang, inquiring about the date of his wedding.

Li Minghui has decided to guest star in a film for Xinhua. The script is adapted from the silent film "Transparent Shanghai" by Da Zhonghua. The male lead may still be Wang Yuanlong.

The Mei Lan Flower Shop will be renamed "Green Treasure Station" during the summer vacation. Miss Gu Meijun is working hard to prepare for this.

### The Great Charity Sale in the Art World

— Hang Chiying

It seems that charity work is not something that commercial artists and craft artists do. This is what most people think. Their views are based on their accumulated ideas – that commercial artists and craft artists are not related to society.

The Chinese Commercial and Industrial Arts Writers Association is now cooperating with all of Shanghai's Chinese painters, Western painters, sculptors, art photographers, and antique collectors to continue actively launching a great charity sale in the art world. Based on the experience of last year's winter clothing exhibition, we have improved six points in the preparation and execution of the charity sale: (1) We have extended the preparation period to a month and a half to collect more brand new art and craft items, and we are paying special attention to promoting handicrafts that should be promoted; (2) We use labels of different colors to indicate the two different natures of the products: Category A (fully donated) and Category B (half donated), which can show the donor's benevolence; (3) We try to keep the prices of the products as low as possible, so that charitable buyers are happy to participate, and the products are widely sold; (4) We do not sell tickets, and do not solicit miscellaneous donations, focusing on charity sales rather than urging purchases; (5) The collected精品 are exhibited in two batches on the 15th and 18th, so that latecomers will not be disappointed; (6) We minimize the preparation time and expenses after the opening as much as possible.

In addition to improving the above six points, all members of the charity sale preparatory committee, from the chairman to the secretaries of various groups, are sacrificing their professional income to contribute to the charity sale and provide voluntary services to the charity sale, mobilizing the entire group; it can be said that our artists have given as much light as they have warmth.

Our goal is not only to make our charity sale a success and set off a single shot; our greatest hope is that the people of Shanghai will all know their responsibilities and participate in the charity sale, so that charity sales are prevalent in every corner of the city. (Charity Donation)

### A Record of Wang Youchen's Spirit Delivering a Message After Death (Part 2)

— Su Shaoqing

(Editor's Note) The anecdotes and stories about Wang Youchen mentioned in this article are quite interesting, so we are happy to publish it. If viewed with a scientific mind, the idea of spirit delivering a message is close to superstition. Mr. Su's work is nothing more than a remembrance of an old friend, and is certainly not advocating superstition.

In the twenty-first year, I revisited Beiping, and Youchen and his wife invited me to their home. We ate, drank, and talked happily for several days. After that, we did not meet for another six years. Last winter night, I saw Youchen in a daze, dressed like Liu Xianzu from the camp series, as he was famous for playing this role. He said to me, "I am now entrusting a son to you. Please, for the sake of our old friendship, do not refuse." I don't remember anything else he said. When I woke up, I realized it was just a dream. I didn't know that Youchen was already dead. More than ten days later, the newspapers reported his death. He was only ill for three days and could not be saved. Then was the previous dream really Youchen's soul coming? How strange! Youchen died at the age of fifty-six. His eldest son's name is so-and-so. He studied English at a young age and entered the political world early. His youngest son studies opera and is good at playing martial roles, but his name is not very well-known. Is he the son that Youchen entrusted to me? Someday, if I have the opportunity, I will certainly live up to the expectations of my old friend in the afterlife.

Youchen had a beautiful appearance and was gentle like a Confucian scholar, so his performances of "Beating the Rod," "Escaping from the Box," "Cao Cao Releasing Officials," and "Empty City Stratagem" were all appropriate for his identity. He mostly performed opera about 打泡戏, and his voice was particularly good in the past. He ate 正工调, and had high, wide, and bright tones, and his 疙瘩音 was convenient, many, and large. There were some places where he was not used properly, and some people criticized him for this. I once said that Youchen's vocal cords were like the tenderest, best, and most wrinkled flute membrane. His voice was beautiful to hear, but it sounded as soon as he blew, and there was an uncontrollable trend, which was the first-class voice. He first studied with Mr. Chen Fusheng (I also studied with him and was a junior classmate, such as Shi Huibao, Meng Xiaoru, etc. were all Chen's disciples). Later, he specialized in copying Tan's tune. He sang many old tunes, covering them with Tan's style, but lacked strength in his bones. This was due to his temperament and talent, and could not be changed by human effort. Although his 字音 skills were not as good as Yu Shuyan and Yan Jupeng, his singing method adhered to the classic style and did not dare to fabricate it. If you listen to his records, you can prove that what I said is not wrong. His generosity and stability are beyond the reach of others. According to my decision, his best play was "Qionglin Banquet" first, "Empty City Stratagem" second, "Lianying Village" third, and "Bumping the Tablet" was a middle-grade play. As for "Cao Cao Releasing Officials," Youchen would always 脱板 or forget the words, and I saw him make mistakes three times. Every time Youchen made a mistake, he would call out "闹鬼儿" incessantly. This is also one of Youchen's anecdotes and jokes. If he knew in the afterlife, he would probably laugh at it.

Reasons for the Increased Status of Actors after the Republic of China

(3) Su Governor Feng Guozhang invited Sun Juxian to Ning to perform a three-day charity show for disaster relief. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, Feng was appointed Su Governor, Qi Yaolin was the Provincial Governor, and Wang Guilin was the Chief of the Jiangning Police Department. Feng was from Hejian Prefecture, and Qi and Wang were both from Tianjin. In fact, Qi was from the three northeastern provinces, but since his whole family had lived in Tianjin for many years, he could also be said to be from Tianjin. Therefore, the officials and staff in the Governor's Office, the Provincial Governor's Office, and the Police Department were mostly from Zhili Province. That year, there was a flood in the province, so these fellow Zhili natives in Ning initiated a disaster relief association and sent someone to Tianjin to hire Sun Juxian, a senior member of the Pear Garden, to go south to perform charity shows for three consecutive days at the Qingle Tea Garden in Neiqiao. When the shows were announced, the words "Fellow Villagers" were written in gold letters and posted on the walls of major thoroughfares. The ticket price was specially sold for two yuan, which was a shocking innovation at that time. Old Sun was nearly seventy years old at that time. When he put on his Ning mouth, his original pale beard was exposed. However, he was energetic and walked with a generous pace, looking like he was only in his fifties. As for the program of his three days, it was "Vermilion Mole," "Xiaoyaojin," and "Fish Hiding Sword." When he sang, he was full of tunes, and his voice was magnificent. Before he took the stage on the first day, a senior official from the Governor's Office delivered a speech to the audience on behalf of Governor Feng, praising Sun's personality and art, and that his coming to Ning to perform for his hometown to raise funds for disaster relief, expressed special respect for Sun's old age, not hesitating to work hard and travel long distances. After the show, Feng, Qi, and others prepared a grand banquet to entertain him, treating him with respect, and not harboring any humble feelings because he was from the Pear Garden. When Sun returned north, many officials from various offices went to the river to see him off, and the grand occasion was like the movements of important figures. This is another clear proof of the increase in the value of actors.

(4) Lu Governor Zhang Zongchang held a military parade and even accompanied Cheng Yanqiu to watch it. For the Double Tenth Festival in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, General Wei Tui held a three-day celebration opera. At that time, the famous actors who came to Jinan to participate included Chang Xiaolou, Yu Shuyan, Mei Lanfang, Wang Fengqing, Shang Xiaoyun, Xun Huisheng, Gan Yanqiu, Xiao Cuihua, Li Wanchun, Wang Changlin, etc. At that time, Yanqiu was the youngest of all the female characters (only twenty-one or two years old), and his figure was not as stout as it is now. His speech was very elegant, like a young woman, so General Zhang particularly liked him. Not only did he give him generous rewards, but he also stayed close to him. The strangest thing was that during the military parade on National Day, Lao Zhang actually brought Yanqiu with him, and asked him to stand next to him. In fact, it is no different from 姊行母令. I heard that "Mysterious Lady" has been completed, and I heard that Lu Ming calls Qinfang "Mom" in the film, which is very moving to the audience.

Returning to Yihua After Being Overseas. In the ocean is Qian Aihua, bright eyes and white teeth, quite like the American movie star Joan Beck. She once went to sea to accompany dancing, and has recently returned to Yihua and is very busy, because she has important performances in "Three Collections of Incarnate Girl" and "Swallow Thief."

Old Newspaper Excerpts (19)

### Seeking to Re-Establish a Treaty

(From the May issue of this newspaper, Tongzhi 11th year of the Qing Dynasty)

China and Prussia's treaty is nearing its expiration date. The Prussian envoy has informed the Prime Minister's Office, saying, "Our nation and your esteemed dynasty have long enjoyed good relations. The treaty, written in blood, is recorded in the alliance archives. It should be observed forever, as an example to future generations. Now that the old treaty is nearing its expiration, and a new one has not yet been negotiated, how can the golden documents of our two countries remain suspended for so long?" It seems the Prussian envoy intends to re-establish a treaty with China.

### Chinese Laborers Being Sold Abroad

There is an uninhabited island off the coast of Peru, overgrown and barren, covered in bird droppings. Because it is difficult to cultivate, Peruvians force Chinese laborers in Peru to go to the island to dig guano. The foul air is stifling, and the poisonous mist is oppressive. Within a year or so, these men are sure to die. Although it is said that they receive an extra two dollars in addition to the original eight dollars in wages, what man would go to a place of death for the sake of two dollars? Such is the plight of these Chinese laborers. As for those who traffic in "pigs" in Macau, they sell the lured people to ship owners for a price of fifty or sixty dollars per head. Once the ship owners arrive in Peru, they can earn three or four hundred dollars per person. After deducting the fifty or sixty dollars paid to the traffickers and seventy dollars for travel expenses, they can earn a net profit of over two hundred silver dollars per person. If they carry three or four hundred people, the business is quite lucrative. Therefore, they spare no effort in managing the trafficking business in Macau, and they have no conscience whatsoever. Some foolish people are willing to go, unaware of the conditions in that country and the plight of the laborers. Eight dollars in wages may not seem meager in China, but the cost of food and clothing in that country means that even those who earn twenty or thirty dollars a month cannot save any money. How much more hardship must those who receive only eight dollars endure? Moreover, upon arrival, they are forced to dig guano on the island, a truly cruel policy. This year, a coolie ship encountered a storm and docked on the coast of Japan. The coolies, aware of the inside story, jumped into the water, hoping for a chance at life. This case was thus exposed. When the truth comes to light, a strong protest should be lodged with Peru.

### Finance: Tianjin Port Electric Telegram, Cash Fluctuates

Yesterday, the cash Shanghai Clearing House (烚赤) black market situation fluctuated as before. The general trend was up first, then down, and finally back up, completely controlled by supply and demand. At the opening, a certain silver house, acting on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, was buying aggressively. Other silver houses were also following suit for their clients, so the price once rose to a high of 2,119 yuan. Then, money exchange firms and securities firms, acting on behalf of the Tianjin gang, flocked to sell. A certain money exchange firm was also vying to dump, so the market trend inclined downward, once falling to a low of 2,102 yuan. Finally, the silver house gang's buying interest revived, and their money exchange firms made up for their profits, so the price gradually rose to close at 2,111 yuan. The final price increased by 2 yuan. However, there was still much fluctuation along the way, but no excessive turbulence. It is said that after closing, the Tianjin gang had new selling intentions, calling the price down to 2,109 yuan, but they still could not find a buyer, so no deal was made. Trading was brisk, about 1,050 taels. Silver ornaments rose first and then fell, resulting in no change. Customs gold remained flat. Central England pure gold and the like declined slightly.

Shanghai Clearing House (烚赤) Trading Still Brisk

Starting in the morning, each bar of ten taels. At the opening, the silver house gang, on behalf of the Hong Kong gang and other silver houses, had strong buying interest, and the market situation was quite firm. First, a certain silver house bought 50 taels from a securities firm at a starting price of 2,117 yuan, which was 8 yuan higher than the previous close. After opening, the silver house gang bought 50 taels from a certain money exchange firm at 19 yuan. Subsequently, a certain silver house also bought 100 taels from a certain money exchange firm on behalf of the Hong Kong gang at the same price. After that, the silver house gang continued to buy, but the Tianjin gang, through money exchange firms and securities firms, were relentlessly dumping, so the capital position felt oversupplied, and the price inclined downward. A money exchange firm sold 50 taels to the silver house gang at 16 yuan. Later, money exchange firms and securities firms successively sold a total of 100 taels to the silver house gang at 12 yuan each. At that time, a certain money exchange firm also joined the selling side, so the price became even more unsustainable. A certain money exchange firm sold 50 taels to the silver house gang at 10 yuan. At that time, the silver house gang stopped buying, and the sellers' selling intentions became more urgent, so the price dropped sharply by another 8 yuan. A certain money exchange firm and securities firm mutually sold 50 taels each to a certain gold shop at a price that retreated to 02 yuan. Later, the silver house gang's buying interest revived, so the price rose sharply again. A certain gold shop bought 50 taels from a securities firm at 07 yuan. The silver house gang bought 50 taels from a money exchange firm at 08 yuan, and then bought another 50 taels from a money exchange firm at 12 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop sold for profit, dumping a total of 100 taels to the silver house gang at 10 yuan each. A money exchange firm sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange firm at 08 yuan. A securities firm sold 50 taels to the silver house gang at 04 yuan. A certain money exchange firm recovered and bought 50 taels each from money exchange firms and securities firms at 05 yuan. It was already noon at that time. Later, because a certain gold shop recovered and bought, the situation became slightly firmer. First, it bought 50 taels from a money exchange firm at 07 yuan, and then bought another 50 taels from a money exchange firm, and the price jumped to 11 yuan (the seller was still the Tianjin gang dumping). After that, money exchange firms and securities firms still had selling intentions, but because gold shops and silver house gangs were all watching, although they called the price down to 09 yuan, they still could not find a buyer, so no deal was made. The evening closing price was still 2,111 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher than the closing price of the night before, a difference of 17 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand gold was 2,115 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,100 yuan. The current bidding gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and no deals were made.

Gold Ornaments Rise and Fall

The selling price of silver house gold ornaments per tael initially did not change. However, at 9:42, because the Shanghai Clearing House (烚赤) opening was quite firm in the morning, the price was raised by 1 yuan. Not long after, about ten minutes later, because the Shanghai Clearing House (烚赤) potential was downward, the price immediately fell back by 1 yuan. After that, no changes were seen, and the result was no gain or loss. Da Tong Hang still maintained the original price of 214 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang was 212 yuan, with a purchase price of 206 yuan.

Pure Gold Suddenly Reduced by Half a Penny

According to a London telegram from the 3rd, the price of British pure gold suddenly reduced by half a penny per ounce, falling to £7 8s 5½d. As a result, the central bank's purchase price of Chinese cash also decreased to 1,211 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold remained flat, at 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen 6 li. The Shanghai standard bidding gold price also fell by 4 jiao, at 1,207 yuan and 2 jiao.

### Foreign Exchange Futures: Selling Trend Intensifies, Exchange Rate Relaxes, Arbitrage Uninteresting

Although the exchange market yesterday saw Hua Shang yarn and cotton gangs and major foreign firms competing to aggressively buy spot and forward British and American gold, and the British bank Youli (acting for the Tianjin gang) also followed suit, buying spot sterling, because British and American foreign banks were still maintaining their selling prices for spot goods, especially with the forward selling intentions being stronger, and because Hong Kong suddenly came to dump spot sterling, the capital position felt quite ample, so the market situation was now flat and forward was looser. As a result, the swap gradually narrowed. At present, the monthly difference is only 0.03125 for sterling and only 0.0625 for US exchange. The spot-month is weak, with sterling around 0.1875 and US exchange around 0.3125. The total monthly interest (excluding commission) is only about 3.7%, so the arbitrage mindsets of general wealthy merchants are gradually becoming uninteresting. Trading was brisk. The Hong Kong exchange rate initially hardened slightly because the banks were selling aggressively, but the foreign firms took advantage of the cheapness and repeatedly aggressively bought, causing it to return to flat.

Early in the morning, the London long-term and short-term shrank by 0.0625, New York silver prices remained stagnant, London bullion fell by half a penny, the exchange rate for British against American fell by a little over 0.1%, against Shanghai fell by 0.03125, against French unchanged, American against British fell by 0.0625, against Shanghai unchanged, against French shrank by 0.0625. Central posted exchange rates as before. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, British exchange at 8.25 pence, US exchange at 16.0625 yuan, both unchanged from the previous close. After opening, Hua Shang yarn and cotton gangs and major foreign firms competed to aggressively buy spot sterling and US gold, but because British and American banks were still willing to sell, there was little change. Hua Shang yarn and cotton gangs and foreign firms successively settled spot sterling at 8.25 pence with HSBC and Macao Lee, and also bought spot US exchange at 16.0625 yuan with Hua Bi and a certain bank. When HSBC posted its price, it was unchanged, and when the silver equalization tax was announced, it fell by half a point, with a levy of 6.25%. After that, although Youli, a foreign bank, aggressively bought spot sterling on behalf of the Tianjin gang, the situation remained largely unchanged because Hong Kong telegrams came to sell. Hong Kong telegrams sold spot sterling at 8.25 pence to Youli. Later, Hua Shang yarn and cotton gangs and foreign firms came to aggressively buy forward US exchange, but the foreign firms had stronger buying intentions for forward, and Hua Bi, a foreign firm, frequently sold August US exchange to yarn and cotton gangs and foreign firms from 15.625 yuan, loosening to 0.6875. Subsequently, Holland, a foreign firm, also bought August British gold at 8.0625 pence from foreign firms, so the process was slightly looser and harder. Near noon, East Asia Anda also sold spot Hong Kong exchange to foreign firm money exchange firms at 55.625 yuan and 0.75, and the situation was slightly looser. By the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices for British and American exchange rates were no different from the morning opening. Hong Kong exchange was 55.75 yuan.

In the afternoon, although foreign firms still came to buy spot British and American gold, because foreign firms' selling intentions were still good, the underlying potential was ultimately difficult to change. It is estimated that when foreign firms settled, foreign firm Hua Bi and Holland settled spot US exchange at 16.0625 yuan, and then bought spot sterling at 8.25 pence from British bank HSBC. After entering, foreign firms also bought spot Hong Kong exchange at 55.625 yuan from foreign firm Anda Holland, and the situation returned to flat. By the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 8.725 pence for British exchange, 16.0625 yuan for US exchange, and 55.625 yuan for Hong Kong exchange. As a result, the British, American, and Hong Kong exchange rates were all unchanged from the closing price of the night before.

### Foreign Currencies Loosen

Yesterday, British pure gold fell by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate fell by 0.0625. Foreign exchange firms in the local port settled a lot, and the yarn and cotton gangs had a great need. Fortunately, the banks supplied smoothly, and the market price was as stable as before. Forward also trended toward loosening. At the opening of the Shanghai Clearing House (烚赤), gold shops and silver houses were absorbing very strongly. Later, money exchange firms and clients, etc., made profits and supplied. In the afternoon, supply and demand were very scarce, and people's hearts were restless and uncertain. The result was a slight increase. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, were absorbed quite heavily by the wealthy. British and American gold notes were actively traded, and the supply was relatively abundant. Moreover, exchange bills and forward were loosening together, and the market price trended toward loosening. The need for French franc notes and Australian gold notes was relatively scarce, and the market price dropped slightly. The guild's transactions did not open. Yesterday's market price, British gold notes fell by 4 points, US gold notes fell by half a point, French franc notes fell by 2.5 hao, Australian gold notes fell by 1 jiao, and all other currencies did not change.

### "Counterfeit Notes" Slightly Recover

Tianjin, 4th Telegram: Compared with the morning opening on the 3rd, the black market exchange rate for counterfeit "Joint Reserve Bank Notes" was 4 yuan 5 jiao higher. 100 yuan of legal tender can buy 130 yuan of "Joint Reserve Bank Notes", that is, 1 yuan of "Joint Reserve Bank Notes" is only worth 7 jiao 6 fen 923 li of legal tender.

### Discount Rate Falls Back by One Yuan

Finally, it was 50 yuan 0.5 jiao, which was actually 1 yuan lower than the previous day.

### Central Bank Closed Today

The Shanghai Banking Association's Joint Preparatory Committee yesterday sent a circular to all banks, stating that the Central Bank had sent a letter stating that "May 5th is the anniversary of the establishment of the revolutionary government." As per usual practice, it will be closed for one day on this day. All bills receivable and payable by the bank and the Central Trust Bureau on the 5th will be processed the following day (the 6th). As for other banks and money shops, they will operate as usual.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Cannot Be Held Down

The securities black market remains fluctuating and uncertain. Buying and selling are both extremely slow. However, the bulls are closely watching for occasional drops in market prices. When the German character Tong Shun and No. 41, etc., are sold slightly more, and the price is slightly weaker by one or two jiao, the bulls will come to pull them up, and they must restore them to their original state before stopping. There was no change in the situation in the afternoon. No. 10, No. 41, and Shun Tai were sold, and Da Lai, Lian He, and No. 35 were bought. The market price was slightly higher by 5 fen. The results of the full day's market price were only slightly better by 5 fen 1 jiao. The total transaction volume was about 500,000 yuan. Today, Sun Yat-sen's inauguration as Extraordinary President is a memorial holiday, and the market is closed. The details are listed in the table below.

Stock trading: 50 shares of Chinese Merchant Securities shares were traded at a price of 29 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen.

There were not many transactions on the Shanghai Public Association Stock Market, but the market atmosphere can be called good. Ken Zhi shares suddenly rose to 8 yuan. At closing, there were sellers at this price and buyers at 7 yuan 9 jiao. Rui Rong common shares were priced at 7 yuan 4 jiao, and demand was very strong. Yi He shares were slightly weaker due to the drop in yarn prices. The closing bid price was 18 yuan 7 jiao, and the asking price was 18 yuan 8 jiao. Rubber shares seemed to have a turnaround, but the transaction volume was small because the bid price and asking price were too far apart.

London British Merchant Far East Companies' stock market prices on the 3rd of this month (Wednesday) rose slightly. HSBC Bank British registered shares rose by half a pound, priced at 84 and a half pounds. Gula Klumpang Rubber shares rose by 7 and a half pence, priced at 17 shillings 6 pence. The rest were unchanged.

London Chinese foreign debt market prices on the 3rd of this month (Wednesday): Only the Reorganization Loan bonds rose by half a pound, priced at 51 and a half pounds. The rest were undecided.

### Yarn and Cotton: Major Players Return to the Market, Cotton Yarn Falling Wind Revives, Actual Sales Only Reach Two-Tenths

The yarn market is unpredictable, and the falling wind has revived. In reality, those who used to drag and abuse the market in the past, seeing that customer sales are not smooth, are undecided. At the same time, among them, the major players who emerged at the peak are coming back to sell. According to the market, they are deliberately suppressing the price with the intention of still going long. As a result, the market chips are feeling even looser, and the trend is unusually chaotic for a while. The waves of the market price are huge, making people shudder. However, those outside the industry are still entering and exiting frequently, and the briskness of the transactions is also considerable. Therefore, it has created a situation of crazy rising and crazy falling. Judging from the above situation, the future is still in stormy waves. The reason is that the rise in the past was too violent, and the fall today is too rapid. The false wind revived in the afternoon, and the spot price of 20-count Shuang Ma foreign stock yarn fell sharply to 420 yuan. After the price fell, it aroused the recovery intentions of certain parties, saying that it was 30 yuan lower than the peak price on Monday, and they worked hard to buy in on the table. As a result, the momentum was revived, jumping up 6 yuan in an instant, and doing business at 426 yuan again, but it was still flat after closing, and the stock order price was 424 yuan.

The situation of spot yarn: At the opening in the early morning, the market situation rose slightly, but the Hong Kong gang had a slight stomachache, and the opening price did not move. The spot price of 20-count Shuang Ma was 433 yuan, and it fell by 2 yuan shortly after. Then, the selling wind suddenly flourished, and the shouting was deafening. The market price gradually declined, falling to 425 yuan, and the stock order price was 415 yuan. Then, certain parties felt it was a great bargain and came back to buy, and they saw a recovery of two or three yuan. The opening in the afternoon was slightly weaker, and the selling momentum was even stronger, and the falling wind started again. In an instant, the spot yarn of 20-count Shuang Ma foreign stock fell to 420 yuan, and the stock order price was 413 yuan. Later, the hoarders, greedy for its cheapness, suddenly dragged in, and the recovery wind rose again, reaching 426 yuan, and the stock order price was 417 yuan. It is said that after closing, there were many people willing to sell, but they could not make a deal. It is found that the total amount bought by each gang throughout the day was 2,455 bales, and the market price of 20-count Shuang Ma Tian Nu fell by 7 or 8 yuan compared with the previous day. Others also fell by 3 or 5 yuan, etc. 80% of the transactions in the market were ball transactions. Today, 565 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, and 110 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left.

Same Industry: 1,950; Hong Kong: 220; Mainland: 285; Total: 2,455.

The Japanese yarn market is still chaotic, but market transactions have been greatly reduced. Because the rise and fall are too great, everyone is wary. However, the market price has fallen again, and 20-count Yueqin withdrew to start at 383 yuan, and did business at 375 yuan in the afternoon.

### Overseas Prices Reported to Rise, Indian Cotton Transactions Becoming More Prosperous

Local Cotton Similar to Stagnation

Foreign cotton market prices: New York presented a beautiful appearance, and the opening rose by 7 pounds. Improved stocks and cotton area weather were the main reasons for the rise. Counterparts also bought in, and the results rose by 2 to 7 pounds. India was closed yesterday, but the black market rise wind was very strong. White Rock April and May have risen to a high price of 159. Egypt has also risen by more than 10 pounds. Forward exchange is still tight. Converted to legal tender, cotton prices have all risen. It is estimated that American cotton and Brazilian cotton have risen by 6 jiao per dan, Indian cotton has risen by 5 jiao, and Egyptian cotton has risen by more than 6 jiao.

Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai have become more active, and factory demand is gradually increasing. This is because American cotton reserves are thin, there is no definite news about the release of loan cotton, and the new cotton will not appear for more than four months. The transportation and sale of cotton produced in our guerrilla area is very difficult. Therefore, in recent days, factories have been ordering large quantities of foreign cotton, especially Indian cotton. Yesterday, Chinese factories ordered 8,000 bales of Indian cotton, and British and Japanese factories ordered 5,000 bales. If the Indian cotton market can drop by a few rupees, the factories will all order large quantities. The factory prices of yesterday's cotton market are recorded below:

Local cotton business is similar to stagnation. In reality, goods are scarce and prices are high, so factories are purchasing and ordering Indian and American cotton to supplement their use. Local cotton transactions have decreased sharply, but the market price has not fallen, and it is slightly weak. The cotton market situation is rarely exciting. The source of Su Bei is also not prosperous. 287 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived, and 408 pieces of Qidong cotton arrived. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.

### Recent Trends in the Cotton Waste Industry

The Yangshupu Japanese Shanghai Spinning Factory's cotton waste originally opened bids for purchase on the first of each month. People of any nationality could bid for purchase. However, starting this month, it has been decided to cancel the bidding. All the factory's cotton waste will be purchased at any time by the Shanghai Japanese cotton waste industry members. Chinese and foreign merchants have no right to participate. Other Japanese yarn factories are still in progress. This matter is not controlled by the Japanese military, as rumored outside. It is entirely caused by the Shanghai Japanese cotton waste industry members manipulating and dominating the industry.

Recently, the Japanese domestic rayon industry has been quite developed. In the past, the industry mostly used wood pulp as a manufacturing raw material, but now it has all been changed to cotton waste and old batting, and a large amount of this raw material has been ordered from Shanghai Japanese merchants. This is also a factor that promotes the control of the Shanghai Japanese cotton waste industry.

After the war, the establishment of small yarn factories in Shanghai was like bamboo shoots after a rain, and the raw materials used were entirely medium and high-grade cotton waste to spin coarse yarn. Therefore, the local cotton waste price is higher than the export price. Foreign firms in Shanghai's cotton waste export industry also have no transactions to do. All they can do is only a small amount of medium-grade and low-grade goods.

Others, such as Chinese Shangxin, Yong'an, and foreign firms Chongxin, etc., are not within the scope of Japanese control. However, Dagu Pass was destroyed by artillery fire, and less than 25% of the machines can be started than before the war. The cotton waste produced is extremely rare. On the one hand, demand exceeds supply, so both sides go in opposite directions, creating a new record high price that is unprecedented.

Since they pay the highest price, they still cannot get the same quality goods as in the past. Since the price of domestic cotton has risen, Shanghai yarn factories mostly use low-grade Indian cotton due to price reasons. The weaving dimension and quality of Indian cotton are not as good as domestic cotton, especially the cotton waste, which is even more different.

After the Japanese merchants controlled the market, it is also difficult to completely monopolize it. A small part of the cotton waste still needs to be resold to Chinese merchants, such as low-grade goods such as pulp bottom scraps. The price of this low-grade goods is very low. If you want to transport it to Japan, the handling fees such as packing and water feet will exceed the original price of the goods. Therefore, this is not what they like to do. According to the above observations, the prospects for Shanghai cotton waste export foreign firms are very bleak. The future transaction path is only a small amount of medium-grade and low-grade goods. (Qi)

### Piece Goods: Small Investors Hope to Sell Cheaply; Prices Differ by Fifty Cents; Eastern Piece Goods Show Frequent Low Bids

Country Cloth: After the recent unprecedented surge in cloth prices, actual sales have remained low. However, with many holders in advantageous positions, there has been little change for the time being. Most manufacturers are rushing to weave orders, and weaving costs, including raw yarn materials, are uniformly increasing. Therefore, quoted prices are higher than those for finished goods on the market. Consequently, wealthy individuals inside and outside the industry are not loosening their grip and continue to buy and hoard. Over three hundred pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, bleached cloth, linen, and goods for travel outfits have changed hands. Small investors have quickly reaped substantial profits on their goods, often reducing prices by several cents per piece to quickly sell. The difference between high and low prices in the market can reach as much as fifty cents per piece. Wholesale shops in this street sold a total of five to six thousand pieces of white goods, coarse cloth, fine cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, poplin, bleached cloth, linen gauze, and printed cloth to inland merchants from Wuxi, Nanjing, Taizhou, Xinghua, and Bengbu. Dyeing factories handled over three thousand pieces of coarse and fine gray fabric, mercerized cotton, and drill. Merchants from Tianjin continued to load large quantities of poplin, striped bleached khaki cloth. Merchants from Guangdong handled over one hundred pieces of fine cloth, and sixty to seventy boxes of colored cloth, colored twill, and poplin. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan, with the upcoming addition of two Greek merchant ships to the Haiphong shipping line this month, which will increase cargo capacity, slightly increased cargo entry. They handled over one hundred pieces of factory cloth, colored cloth, striped bleached goods, and other items.

Eastern Cloth: Fine cloth and fine twill saw sluggish sales yesterday, and businesses in this street took the opportunity to sell short, with frequent low bids in the market. Fine cloth fell by more than twenty cents per piece, while spot fine twill fell by ten cents, and futures fell by thirty-five cents. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is currently priced at fourteen yuan and fifty cents per piece. Besides speculation, actual sales are very weak. Dyeing businesses in this street handled approximately eight to nine hundred pieces of various brands of spot and futures goods. However, foreign firms have not opened up sales, and outside hoarders are still buying cheap. The market shows signs of hovering.

Exports: One hundred and fifty pieces of cloth were exported to Shantou on the fifth, and twenty pieces to Hong Kong.

### Grains: Rice Price Limits Exist in Name Only

Country Rice: No rice arrived from the river ports yesterday, but fourteen to fifteen hundred packages arrived from the Che Lun Baozi and Lai Su gangs, seven hundred and fifty packages from Wuxi, and five hundred packages from Kunshan. Since the sudden surge in the market since the day before yesterday, public sentiment has been very agitated, with high prices emerging in the black market. Top grade japonica rice has already reached fifteen yuan and thirty cents. However, in reality, the total rice stock in Shanghai has only decreased by thirty thousand packages. This situation is due to the manipulation of China's food supply by certain parties, with corrupt officials and merchants complicit in the scheme. Rice coming from the south is being detained at the Rice Market Ferry in large quantities and is not being released. It is said that only five trucks (each carrying one hundred and fifty packages) are allowed to be shipped out from Wuxi each day, but this needs to be verified. Rice from Songjiang is still being transported by foreign firms. Japanese and puppet merchants in the Su and Tong areas, seeing the large profits, are also trying to get involved. Not only rice but even pork is being detained, leading to drastic price increases. In the future, the only way to alleviate the suffering in life is to hope for victory. However, because the price limits were supposedly being "officially" relaxed the day before, many people dragged in rice. Afterward, they would rather quietly sell at higher prices in the black market, while nominally adhering to the price limits, and many people also returned goods. Therefore, when the market opened yesterday, public sentiment calmed down, and shops in this street and hoarders only traded among themselves. As a result, thick and thin japonica rice prices were stable, and Du Yang Jian, Bu Jian, and Bian Yuan prices were also uneventful.

Ke Xian: Trains and riverboats have been arriving continuously in recent days. Yesterday, approximately six thousand packages of new Jing and Wu Xian rice arrived. Since the Shanghai price increased step by step, it has prompted transportation by merchants. Therefore, hoarders suddenly stopped handling them, and shops in this street could not even sell a total of three thousand packages. It is said that the selling price of Jing and Wu Xian rice was subsequently reduced by ten cents.

### Flour Rises Another Ten Cents

Number Two Flour Already at Four Yuan and Fifty-Five Cents; Rumors Say Tianjin Flour Can Be Sold for Five Yuan

Flour prices rose again yesterday, according to flour mill prices. Although sales once slowed down after the flour price increased step by step, demand picked up again yesterday. According to news from the Beiyang gang, Tianjin flour can be sold for five yuan, so transportation profits are quite good. Some people are hoarding Tianjin flour every day, all because of the high price expectations. Retail sales in the Nanyang gang are also lively. Under the circumstances of active sales, the factory fears that raw materials from abroad will rise again, and that stocks will be depleted and production will be scarce. Therefore, they are repeatedly raising prices to limit the large-scale supply. The price of Number Two flour rose five cents in the morning yesterday, only for retail transactions in this street. It rose another five cents in the afternoon, reaching four yuan and fifty-five cents in cash. As a result, in addition to transactions in this street, the North and South gangs and other small investors traded a total of fifty to sixty thousand packages. According to market talk, this surge in rice prices is related to the future of the flour market, so public sentiment is still bullish.

Foreign flour is also showing strength. It is found that overseas production prices are frequently rising, and forward prices have reached four yuan and eighty cents in US dollars. It is said that a certain foreign firm will have more than one hundred thousand packages of Flag flour arriving today, and the market is quite stable. It is said that the market price of foreign flour is gradually equal to that of factory flour, generally four yuan and fifty-five cents and four yuan and fifty cents in cash, but there is no substantial transaction.

Exports: Twelve thousand packages were shipped to Tianjin today, and eight thousand packages to Shantou.

### Wheat Prices Look Bullish But Difficult; Foreign Wheat Arrives Continuously

Yesterday, the source of local wheat was still scarce. Since flour prices increased step by step, holders are all sticking to their holdings, waiting for a good price. However, the current wheat market environment is not comparable to the flour market. Today, another seven thousand tons of Australian wheat arrived in Shanghai, and foreign firms are repeatedly offering forward foreign wheat. It is said that bulk shipments of Flag wheat are only six yuan and sixty to seventy cents, which is cheaper than local wheat. However, the shipping schedule will take two months. The future of local wheat is greatly affected. Currently, all factories are using foreign wheat, and the demand for local wheat may be difficult to develop for the time being. The formal market will likely have to wait for the new wheat to arrive.

Additional: Seven thousand seven hundred and thirteen tons of Australian wheat, or ninety-two thousand and eleven packages, handled by foreign firms, were transported to Shanghai by the King William, managed by Jardine Matheson. It was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday and was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the ship is moving slowly and will not be able to enter port until this morning, and will be berthed at buoys nine and ten for unloading.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Even Soybeans Cannot Hold Up

Market Falls by More Than Ten Cents

Recently, the Dalian soybean market relied on the unified control issue to support its monopoly, so it was able to maintain its original price for six or seven days. However, sales were not active, leading to a decline of more than ten cents. It is estimated that five trucks of spot Dalian soybeans are priced at nine yuan and seven to two cents. A truck to be delivered in two weeks is also priced at nine yuan and two cents. Other beans are, in fact, only embellishments. Therefore, with supply and demand evenly matched, the market is quite stable. It is estimated that more than one hundred packages of Chongming sand yellow beans were traded at a price of nine yuan and five cents to eight yuan and eighty cents, one hundred and ten packages of Nanjing beans at a price of eight yuan and sixty-five cents, and one hundred packages of Wuhu beans at a price of nine yuan and twenty cents delivered. Two hundred and fifty packages of beans will be shipped to Shantou on the fifth.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Sales Remain Strong

New York Silk Market Unrelentingly High; Will Cause Silk Mills to Purchase Substitutes

Overseas silk market, rising winds are still strong. Yokohama spot prices rose fifteen yuan, forward prices rose eight yuan. New York standard silk recently rose two cents, forward streamlined rose one point eight three seven five cents. Japanese silk each rose five cents. Shanghai silk then still no opening. Regarding Japan and the US silk price, soaring wings have reached the top. The largest consumer of raw silk, the United States, even if the phenomenon of spot squeeze, still has not reduced slightly. But these silk prices, will also be incompatible with silk prices. Furthermore, the United States in the near future, will have a further artificial silk, named Nylon (according to this kind of fiber is no matter the difference with current artificial silk, can be said to be completely like real silk), then the raw silk spot squeeze, will lead silk mills to purchase substitutes, and more quickly to achieve the appearance of the best substitutes.

Local silk market, white factory seven eight points, foreign firms enter the stomach very hard, market price rose twenty yuan, unfortunately only one hundred packages traded, French Zhuang also followed to absorb purchases yesterday, white factory B character RR price one seven five zero -- one seven six five yuan, doing open sixty dan, for Ren Chang and other firms to buy, US Zhuang silk is Ta Chang · Jardine · Ren Ji · more active, Jingli through the US sales, only a power generation yesterday, Indian foreign firms then enter ten dan, the price opened original market,

### Oil Cakes: Raw Soybean Oil Hoarders Take Profits and Exit

Yesterday's raw soybean oil market situation, continuing the previous day's momentum, seemed likely to advance, but general floating hoarders locked in profits, and with the source temporarily not expected to be cut off, the chips suddenly felt abundant, and large hoarders' appetites were also weak. Prices fell one yuan, and one hundred and fifty pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded at a price of thirty-seven yuan. Road goods also opened at thirty-seven yuan, and one hundred and forty pieces were traded. Dalian soybean oil was opened at one hundred and fifty barrels at a price of forty-five yuan and fifty-five cents, Fengnian oil fifty barrels, forty-five yuan, white pressed oil ten barrels, forty yuan and five cents.

### Sugar Market: Dutch Sugar Rising Winds Still Fierce

Yesterday, Dutch sugar production area forward nine ten eleven months according to C.I.F. cases for Dutch shield nine · two zero, rose zero · three five, seven eight months according to C.I.F. cases for six · two eight, nine months five · six two five, Taikoo sugar still in suspension of sale, so the market situation still up exhibition.

### Seafood: Western Dried Mussels, New and Old, Are in Demand

Since the arrival of new Western dried mussels, the number released has been surprisingly small. Recently, a small batch of small dried mussels arrived and has already been sold out. The price is seventy-five yuan, which is five yuan higher than before. It is found that the medium and large colored old goods here will also be sold out.

### Metals: Eastern White Iron Rises By Some Cents

A lot of spot Eastern white iron came from Osaka a few days ago, causing the selling price in this port to decline. Moreover, Japanese manufacturers in this port are also releasing a large amount of spot goods, so the market has been depressed. Customers and buyers are aware of the abundance of goods in the market. Recently, Osaka shipments cannot be shipped due to the Japanese government's control, so the Japanese manufacturers in this port are in high spirits, and the selling price has also been gradually increased. Recently, such as 37 inches each sell two yuan seven jiao five cents, 36 inches two yuan one jiao six cents, are more than one jiao one two cents better than the previous market. In terms of sales to customers, it has not been very active recently. The only reliance of the market is the construction gang in this street. There are few other outlets, and there are no new developments in the whole city.

Chinese Medicine and Food Therapy

### Women with Metrorrhagia and Irregular Menstruation Should Often Eat Donkey-Hide Gelatin and Glutinous Rice Porridge

— Xie Yenong

A woman's menstrual period occurs once a month, with the menstrual fluid flowing slowly. The period is vigorous for three to five days, after which it gradually decreases and clears. This is the normal situation. If the date is early or late, and the flow is too much or too little, these are all signs of illness. Metrorrhagia and spotting are one type of menstrual disorder. If there are blood clots mixed in with the menstrual blood, and it does not stop for a long time, this is a precursor to metrorrhagia and should be given immediate attention. One should rest quietly and avoid strenuous activity, as movement can prevent the ruptured blood vessels from clotting and make it difficult to stop the bleeding. When it develops into metrorrhagia, the blood rushes down in large quantities, like a breached dam. At this time, the body suddenly loses nourishment, and the complexion turns pale. The skin, lips, and fingertips also turn white as death. The spirit weakens, strength diminishes, the heart palpitates, the limbs become numb, and sensation becomes dull, even leading to sudden collapse and fainting. To attempt emergency treatment, only use Jilin ginseng decoction for forced feeding. After the bleeding stops, observe the symptoms and take medication such as Chinese angelica, white peony, astragalus, white atractylodes, licorice, and codonopsis to regulate the condition.

Spotting is chronic bleeding, with the menstrual period trickling continuously, accompanied by symptoms such as lower back pain, fatigue, dizziness, decreased appetite, and other symptoms. The condition is not as serious as metrorrhagia, and the risk is also less. However, before metrorrhagia occurs, it often starts with prolonged spotting. In other words, prolonged spotting can potentially develop into metrorrhagia, so it is advisable to treat it quickly upon seeing spotting. The causes of metrorrhagia and spotting may be falls, impacts, damage from sexual activity, or excessive emotions, sudden anger, and severe stimulation of the nervous system. The main cause is qi deficiency, which prevents blood from being contained, and the onset of the disease leads to a large deficiency of blood. The method of treatment, in addition to using ginseng soup for emergency relief, after the disease has subsided and during the process of spotting, is to prioritize nourishing and replenishing blood. However, blood is not easily produced quickly, and cultivation must be achieved gradually over time. Now, I will introduce a simple and easy-to-implement porridge therapy: cook three measures of glutinous rice into porridge, and when it is almost cooked, add two liang of clear donkey-hide gelatin, cook until it dissolves and mix evenly, and have the patient eat it. Donkey-hide gelatin is a top-grade blood-nourishing product in gynecology, and glutinous rice can benefit qi and strengthen the spleen. When used together, they can tonify deficiency, stop bleeding, and greatly benefit the stomach and intestines. Therefore, this prescription may seem plain and unremarkable, but it is extremely effective with long-term consumption.

### Dietary Dos and Don'ts After Childbirth

— Zhang Ruwei

After childbirth, a woman's body is weak, with depleted blood, and new blood gradually regenerating. At this time, attention to diet is most important. However, customs vary from place to place. For example, in the Jiangshi area (referring to the vicinity of Suzhou, Songjiang, Changzhou, and Taizhou), women mostly eat rice porridge for the first half-month after childbirth, and soft rice only in the second half-month. For ordinary dishes, dried vegetables are best (i.e., small Shanghai greens in winter), as they best nourish the stomach and generate fluids. Alternatively, use walnut kernels without the skin, deep-fried in oil, and mix with half each of pepper salt and white sugar. Or cook ham until tender and eat the soup and lean meat. All greasy and rich foods are forbidden. However, people from Ningbo do not eat porridge after childbirth, but only eat brown sugar paste noodles. In Tonglu and Fuyang in Zhejiang, Yixian in Anhui, and other places, eggs, chicken, or pork knuckles are eaten after childbirth, but raw, cold, sour, and spicy foods are avoided everywhere. The prescription book has a method of eating mutton after childbirth, but I say that this is suitable after the full moon. If the parturient cannot eat mutton, it can be replaced with tofu skin. All of these can help with physical strength after childbirth.

### Eating Duck is Most Suitable for Women with Multiple Births

— Xu Jintao

When a woman is pregnant, the fetus eats the mother's blood every day for nourishment. If a woman has multiple births, it will inevitably lead to a large deficiency of qi and blood. Without proper recuperation, a weak body is likely to develop into postpartum tuberculosis. The symptoms include lower back pain, bone pain, weakness in the limbs, mental fatigue, dizziness, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, and memory loss. This is because of excessive blood loss and the gradual depletion of the body. Although the body's blood can be replenished with medicine, each person's endowment is different, and the degree of loss varies. Although there are many drugs that are effective in tonifying, the medicinal properties are inevitably complex, and the strength may not be appropriate. It is better to supplement with foods that are nutritious and suitable for the appetite. Duck is sweet and cool in nature, nourishes the yin of the five organs, clears the heat of deficiency-consumption, replenishes blood, promotes water metabolism, nourishes the stomach, and generates fluids. Therefore, health practitioners say: "Stewing an old male duck until tender is more effective than ginseng essence." The effect of duck can be imagined. It is truly a supreme tonic for nourishing the body and nourishing yin for women with multiple births or those who have developed postpartum tuberculosis. (Following the Cantonese method of adding medicinal ingredients to dishes, you can add 4 qian of Chinese angelica, 4 qian of Chinese yam, 4 qian of Yuzhu, and three or four red dates when cooking duck. The power to nourish blood and maintain health will be even more remarkable. The taste may not be very palatable at first, but after three or four times, the medicinal taste will still be palatable. Sincerely recorded.)

### When Menstruation Comes

— Lin

Every fully developed woman has the inconvenience of bleeding every month, which is menstruation. Healthy women generally have one menstruation every twenty-eight days, but there are exceptions: either one menstruation every thirty or more days, or one menstruation in less than twenty-eight days. As long as the number of days between each menstruation is the same, then there is no need to pay attention. Women's menstrual disorders are mostly caused by not paying attention to health during the menstrual period. If during the initial stage of development, actions are overworked, diet is raw and cold, and no care is taken, it will often result in lifelong suffering and affect the health of the body.

When menstruating, nineteen out of ten women feel tired and have uterine pain caused by the rupture of the egg and bleeding. At this time, all strenuous exercise should be prohibited, rest more, do not eat raw, cold, and stimulating foods, do not overeat, and eat more liquid and nutritious foods, such as milk, eggs, and vegetables. Decoction and drinking one qian of mugwort leaves and yellow wine every day can warm the uterus and regulate menstruation; or daily flush and drink five qian of Yimu paste with a little brown sugar and yellow wine, which also has the effect of promoting blood circulation and regulating menstruation. During this period, if you can eat a hen, the nutritional power will be great. The method is to wash a hen clean, and steam it rotten with three to five qian of Chinese angelica and a little yellow wine. Chinese angelica is an important medicine for replenishing and purifying blood, can treat all blood deficiency and blood turbidity, break evil blood, generate new blood, and replenish women's various deficiencies, and is a good medicine for regulating menstruation and replenishing blood. Eating it with chicken has a greater tonic power than ordinary tonics can compare.

### Food for Promoting Lactation

— Fuming

The biggest problem in raising a baby is breastfeeding. When a baby is in the mother's belly, it is directly nourished by the mother's blood. After delivery, the mother's body naturally undergoes physiological changes, moving the blood needed for fetal nourishment to the mysterious breasts, and still providing it to the baby, but the color has changed from red to white. As the baby grows, the milk quality gradually thickens, and as the baby develops, the milk quality also changes with each passing day. Therefore, mother's milk is really the most suitable food for babies.

Suppose a healthy mother feeds her baby with her own milk every day. Unfortunately, one day her production suddenly decreases, causing the baby to be unable to eat enough and cry. Then the parents' worries are naturally self-evident, and they must come up with various things that can replace breast milk to make up for it. However, some are for economic reasons, and if they are not careful, the baby's delicate spleen and stomach can easily develop diseases, and gradually weaken, or even die.

Why does a mother's milk suddenly decrease? In most cases, it is due to illness or poor nutrition, of course, there are other reasons. Now I will specially introduce two kinds of food therapy methods as follows:

(1) One pair of pig trotters, remove all hair and dirt; add three qian of Akebia trifoliata, and cook a thick juice together, the thicker the better, add a little salt, and the taste is light is better, take the pig trotters and juice as a side dish, although Akebia trifoliata tastes bitter, if you remove Akebia trifoliata do not use, then its function is slightly worse.

(2) Take one black crucian carp, wash it clean, add a few scallions, a few pieces of raw lard, and other seasonings, and cook the juice together to drink it. Its effect is great. Mothers with lack of milk, why not try it.

### Raw Food and Cooked Food

— Xu Linyan

Human physiology is inherently suitable for cooked food, but completely cooked food without a slight admixture of raw food is not a healthy way. Considering the benefits of cooked food, they are (1) suitable for human physiology, (2) disinfection, (3) flavoring, (4) easy digestion; the benefits of raw food are (1) aiding digestion, (2) fully absorbing the nutrients it contains, (3) adjusting the taste, (4) promoting the body's metabolism. Therefore, cooked food and raw food should be equally emphasized.

Among raw foods, the most suitable for the human body are fruits.

No matter what kind of fruit, the vitamins it contains are extremely rich. It is extremely beneficial to eat a little after exertion and after meals. However, the current price of fruits is expensive, and it is no longer affordable for the average person. The only inexpensive item is the tomato.

Tomatoes are red in color and slightly sour in taste. They are produced everywhere. The suburbs of Shanghai abundantly cultivate this item. Westerners have it almost every meal. The various vitamins it contains are extremely rich. When eating, wash its skin first, then soak it in boiling water, and then peel off its skin. Add a little salt or white sugar to eat it, and the taste is extremely delicious. Regular consumption can nourish blood, promote bowel movements, generate fluids, aid digestion, and lengthen strength. Its effects are hard to describe completely; if cooked with meat, it also has a different taste.

### Whooping Cough

— Zhang Zanchen

Whooping cough is initially caused by external contraction of wind and evil. In the beginning, there is a slight chill and fever, nasal congestion and heavy voice, slight cough and sticky phlegm. At this time, people generally do not pay attention to it because of the ordinariness of the symptoms. After one or two weeks, the evil will be suppressed in the lungs and not ventilated. The tracheal mucosa changes as a result, and breathing becomes increasingly short, resulting in an air-reversed state. Coughing then has continuous bursts, even nausea; after a short break, the cough recurs, occurring three or four times to dozens of times a day. The phlegm that is coughed up is a transparent mucus. If treatment is improper, it can often last for two or three months, so it is commonly called "100-day cough". Those who are most susceptible to this disease are children aged one to six, and there are many sufferers when the weather is cold and warm in spring and winter. The method of treatment is to use equal parts of almonds and walnut kernels, remove the skins, mash them into a paste, and add a little ginger, decoction into a soup for flushing. Almonds can benefit the lungs, moisten dryness, relieve coughs and remove phlegm, and are an essential medicine for treating coughs; although walnuts are common foods, because they contain fatty oils, they are extremely rich in nutrition and can cure coughs and sputum; ginger can dispel cold, stop vomiting, resolve phlegm, and reduce secretions. When used together, they are truly a wonderful prescription for treating whooping cough. However, attention must also be paid to the patient's daily nutrition and room temperature to assist.

### Food Therapy Maxims

### Nutritional Value of Soybeans

— Jin Zhensheng

Among agricultural products, the richest in nutrients is soybeans. There are many of its products, such as soy milk, tofu, dried tofu, soy sauce, and soybean sprouts, all of which contain very rich nutrients. According to Li Shizhen, "Eating too many soybeans makes people feel heavy." The four words "makes people feel heavy" are worth savoring, meaning that soybeans are rich in protein and fat, and long-term consumption can make people fat and healthy and increase body weight.

According to scientists, soybeans have five times the heat of potatoes, three times the protein, and two hundred times the fat; therefore, the nutritional value of soybeans is greater than that of any food. Soy milk made from soybeans is called artificial milk, and its nutritional value is no less than that of milk; moreover, the price is very low, and the public can take it.

Now, soybean sprouts made from soybeans have been greatly praised by the British government in the South Seas Islands. Originally, a small capitalist merchant named Hu in the South Seas founded a place specializing in the production of soybean sprouts and sold them to overseas Chinese. As usual, they had to be tested by British politics. Unexpectedly, the test results showed that this food was not only clean and hygienic, but also very rich in nutrients, so it was greatly praised by the British government, attracting the attention of foreign people. The merchant Hu's small business has tripled its profits.

In addition, foods made from soybeans are still very good, and most of them take its essence and discard its dross, and it goes without saying that they contain abundant nutrients. The efficacy and story of tofu do not need to be told.

### Common Cold and Cough

— Zou Demin

Common cold and cough are caused by the invasion of wind evil into the lungs, resulting in the lungs' anti-evil response. Spring causes the human body's pores to open, making it easiest for wind evil to invade, so there are many sufferers. Symptoms include cough, headache, nasal congestion, and clear nasal discharge; in severe cases, fever occurs. This is because the lungs are affected by wind evil, causing the Qi to lose its cleansing and purifying function. Treatment with mild and appropriate medicine should be given, and the cough will stop naturally when the evil is dispelled. For example, medicines such as Qianhu (Peucedani Radix), Jiegeng (Platycodonis Radix), Xingren (Armeniacae Semen), and Suzi (Perillae Fructus) are often effective with just one dose. However, diet must be cautious, so avoiding certain foods is also a significant issue. Vegetarian and light flavors are most suitable, while sour, spicy, and fishy foods can irritate the lungs and easily worsen the cough. Rich and greasy foods can generate phlegm. People nowadays fear taking medicine, regarding a common cold as a minor ailment and not paying attention to it. Some even indulge in food, causing the evil to accumulate in the lungs, transforming into dryness and consuming Yin, resulting in a persistent and unproductive cough, dry mouth, hoarse voice, and eventually damaging the collaterals and coughing up blood, leading to serious mistakes. If it is a child, it is even easier to develop into severe pneumonia. Generally, carelessness in the beginning will surely lead to problems later.

### After Measles Subsides, Attention Should Still Be Paid to Wind-Cold and Diet

— Zhu Zuosan

Often, measles progresses smoothly, but complications arise after the fever subsides. This is all due to carelessness in convalescence.

Measles originally belongs to seasonal epidemic diseases, and promoting eruption is the first priority. Therefore, when the measles has fully erupted and the fever subsides, the evil has been expelled, and the body temperature naturally decreases. Occasionally, some residual measles toxins may remain, but they can decompose on their own and are not a cause for concern. However, due to a slight negligence in protection, the caregivers may believe that the sick child can be allowed to be exposed to wind-cold and can have an unrestricted diet, leading to sudden complications. Because measles erupts in the lung meridian and has been scorched by heat, the lung's cleansing function is lost, and the cough persists. If one catches a cold, severe cases can lead to recurrence of fever and persistent cough. With stagnant lung Qi and excessive phlegm, the condition can turn into bronchitis or pneumonia. In mild cases, with or without fever, the cough will definitely worsen and become difficult to resolve, or it may persist, with lung heat accumulating internally and consuming Yin fluids, leading to post-measles consumption (wasting disease). In addition, because the stomach and intestines are also inflamed at the onset of measles, if the internal condition has not yet settled, careless eating of greasy and indigestible foods will inevitably cause fever, indigestion, and diarrhea, even leading to complications. Sometimes, it is due to the stomach's deficiency fire, leading to excessive appetite, and internal accumulation that persists for a long time often causes worms or malnutrition. Furthermore, contracting both cold and food stagnation can also have two courses, mild or severe, acute or chronic. Mild cases involve a sudden rise in body temperature and the eruption of "cloud rash" (secondary measles rash), which is still easily resolved. Severe cases can lead to internal accumulation causing convulsions or the concurrent onset of external pneumonia. Chronic cases develop gradually, leading to malnutrition and consumption, which are very difficult to treat. Therefore, after measles subsides, there are still points that must be noted, as follows:

Within one week after the fever subsides, it is still advisable to rest in bed. Although windows should be opened to allow air circulation, direct wind should be avoided. Clothing and bedding should not be reduced lightly. In terms of diet, fishy, greasy, stimulating, and triggering foods should be avoided. Daily meals should still consist of thin porridge or scorched rice porridge, accompanied by pickled vegetables (pickled cucumber, pickled radish), kohlrabi, dried jellyfish, dried bamboo shoots, and soft tofu. Snacks such as salty soda crackers, white lotus root powder, and fruits like pears, water chestnuts, red sugarcane, and oranges can be given in moderation. However, if the stool is loose, these should be avoided. After seven days, when the child's spirit gradually recovers, they can get out of bed, but it is still advisable to rest from time to time. Play should not be excessive. If the child is already in school, books should not be read, as eye strain may impair their vision in the future. When the appetite returns, rice can be given in small amounts, but the portion should be reduced by half of what they desire, to avoid overeating. The range of restricted foods can be gradually expanded, starting with vegetables such as spinach and peas, followed by eggs and ham. As for triggering foods such as salted mustard greens, they should still be avoided for several months, as they easily cause sores and scabies.
