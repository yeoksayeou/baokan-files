### German Aircraft Attack British East Coast, All Repelled by Anti-Aircraft Fire

London: Air raid sirens sounded in various locations along the British east coast, including Chatham, Gillingham, Rochester, and Medway, at 7 AM yesterday morning. The all-clear was given at 9 AM. No bombing occurred. Several British fighter planes took off to patrol the area after the alert. Residents were very excited to see the British planes and calmly took shelter in air raid shelters, without any panic. However, no enemy aircraft were sighted until half an hour later, when a disguised German twin-engine bomber was spotted. Anti-aircraft units concentrated their fire on it, and the enemy aircraft quickly retreated. According to eyewitnesses, six enemy aircraft were seen, flying in pairs. After being repelled by anti-aircraft fire, they returned to attack again, but were still unsuccessful. It was observed that several anti-aircraft shells exploded near the tail of one enemy aircraft. While it is not known whether the aircraft was hit and crashed, it was definitely seen descending vertically. The anti-aircraft fire was very intense, and residents in the suburbs of London faintly heard the sound of gunfire. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Warsaw: Seventy German bombers dropped many explosive and incendiary bombs on the outskirts of Warsaw yesterday, causing many deaths and injuries. According to a communiqué released by the Air Defense Command, Polish anti-aircraft units shot down eight German aircraft. Three loud explosions were heard here yesterday morning.

London: The Ministry of Information issued a statement this afternoon, stating that the rumor that British aircraft would fly to Berlin to bomb it is absolutely untrue. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### The Times Comments on the European War Situation

London: The Times commented today on the progress of the European war, saying, "Looking at a map, one can clearly see that the Polish border is not easy to defend. Therefore, the German advance, in terms of both scope and speed, is within our expectations. In the minds of the Germans, however, they may not be satisfied with either of these two points." The newspaper added that the Polish elite troops have made their enemy pay a heavy price. The fact that the Poles did not deploy large numbers of troops to defend territory that they did not intend to hold firmly against a large-scale attack was a clever move. Therefore, the British public should expect the German army to continue to advance, and the Germans may make even greater progress in the north. At present, the Polish army does not show the demoralization that is inevitable after a military defeat. The Times also stated that the actual situation of the German military operations shows that Hitler has violated his promise that air raids would be limited to military targets. Germany has abused its air force, not only on the battlefield, but also in carrying out cruel massacres in undefended cities. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### German War Report

Berlin: According to the official newspaper here, the Polish military base of Westerplatte near the mouth of the Vistula River near Danzig was occupied by German troops this morning. (Haitong dispatch, 7th)

Berlin: The German High Command issued an official report at 5 PM today, stating that German troops entered Kraków at noon today. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)

Berlin: A reporter for the Mittagpost recently published an article in the newspaper, describing in detail the scene of the German army taking over the Graudenz fortress, stating, "The commander of a German regiment led his soldiers in a fierce battle at Graudenz for three days. Relying on the superior terrain and the soldiers' desperate advance, the Graudenz fortress was occupied at 2 PM on the 6th. At that time, church bells rang throughout the city, mixed with the sound of distant artillery. The German army triumphantly entered the fortress. The German army has now established anti-aircraft positions there to defend against air raids." (Haitong dispatch, 7th)

Berlin: Since the industrial centers of Katowice, Königshütte, and Mysłowice in Upper Silesia, as well as the industrial areas of Sosnowiec, Konin, and Będzin in the Dąbrowa region, have been occupied by German troops, most of Poland's heavy industry has fallen into German hands. The coal mines in the occupied area account for 95% of Poland's national production. The remaining 5% is produced in the Kraków area. In addition, the area that produces 108,000 tons of zinc and lead annually in Poland is also in German hands. There are also nitrogen chemical plants in the occupied area that have been seized by the German army. Items such as sulfuric acid, which are necessary for the manufacture of munitions, are also produced in the German-occupied area. Although the technicians and workers in the factories have retreated with the Polish army, the factories have not been destroyed. The German army is now advancing towards the oil region of Jasło, which produces 118,000 tons of oil annually, accounting for 24% of Poland's total oil production. (Haitong dispatch, 7th)

### Chamberlain Reports on the War Situation in the House of Commons; Poland's Courage in Resistance Not Diminished; Cooperation Between Britain and France Proceeding Smoothly

London: When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to a question from Greenwood, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, stating, "Regarding the current situation and the state of our national defense, I can only give a brief overview. This is understandable to the House. Frankly, for the public interest, many issues are not appropriate to mention publicly here. After clarifying this need, I would like to give a brief report on the war situation. In the West, France has mobilized all its forces, and the situation is proceeding very smoothly, the same as in our country. France has also made contact with the enemy. On the Eastern Front, the Polish people are fighting a strong enemy, an enemy that relies on its abundant strength and armaments to destroy all resistance. But the Polish people do not show weakness, and their brave and determined resistance is worthy of the country's traditional spirit. Although the German air force is superior to Poland in quantity, strength, and equipment, Poland is resisting strongly, making the Germans pay a considerable price for every yard they advance. The Germans often say that they need a quick victory, and they seem to want to concentrate their forces to deal with Poland first. As you all know, it has been a week since the German army brazenly invaded Polish territory without a formal declaration of war. Although Poland has suffered losses in manpower and materials, morale is very good and courage has not diminished. In addition, the British and French governments signed an agreement with Poland today to replenish the country's resources, so it can continue to resist. As for France, since the beginning of the war, the nation's determination and solidarity with Poland have been completely consistent with our country. Britain and France have established full understanding, and the cooperation between the two sides is proceeding smoothly. As for our national defense, since last year, the government has taken various precautionary measures, especially in air defense. These measures have now proven to be very effective. The mobilization of army reservists is also proceeding very smoothly. The reservists who have been called up are all in high spirits, and many have already participated in voluntary military training. In addition, a large number of women have been recruited by the auxiliary units of the reserve army. They are able to work in difficult environments and provide comfort to the soldiers at the front, which is commendable." (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### The King Issues an Edict Commending Chamberlain

London: King George VI recently sent an edict to Prime Minister Chamberlain, stating, "Although we have strived to maintain peace, we have finally been forced to go to war. At this critical time for the country's destiny, I deeply appreciate the great efforts made by public officials at home and abroad in the past few years, including efforts to promote peace and prepare for extraordinary events. The dedication since you took office has been appreciated by the people, and I am confident that it will continue in the same spirit until peace is restored." Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "Reading the edict, I am deeply moved and humbled. I respectfully thank Your Majesty for your concern and express my loyalty on behalf of all subjects at home and abroad. All civil and military officials are grateful and determined to uphold the national tradition and fight for justice, freedom, and civilization, believing that they will not fail Your Majesty." (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### British Government Emergency Budget; Chancellor of the Exchequer to Make a Declaration

London: Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon declared in the House of Commons today that he will soon be able to make a declaration on the emergency budget. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### French Munitions Factories Intensify Production

Paris: An official gazette recently published an order stipulating that the work week should be 65 hours, and that some munitions factories and other factories related to national defense should work 72 hours per week, with the distribution of time not exceeding 11 hours per day. In principle, women and children are not allowed to work more than 10 hours per day or 60 hours per week. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### British Political Parties Suspend Political Strife

London: The political parties have recently established a "truce agreement," agreeing to suspend political strife and work together to overcome the difficulties. All election campaigns have been suspended. If there are vacancies for members of parliament, new election methods will be adopted, with each constituency automatically holding by-elections. This method is the same as the one that was implemented during the last World War. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### Romanian Ambassador to France Presents Credentials

Paris: The newly appointed Romanian Ambassador to France, Franasovici, presented his credentials to President Lebrun this morning and delivered a eulogy, saying, "The friendly relations between our two countries and your country's support for our country's free development have been historical. Our people will always remember it." President Lebrun replied, "Although all countries of good will have made many efforts to maintain peace, disaster has finally been unavoidable. At this time, countries around the world are fundamentally threatened. We hope that the spiritual and moral principles, the most valuable principles of mankind, will achieve final victory. Regarding this, I share the same sentiments as Your Excellency." (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### British and French Economic Strategy Against Germany

Paris: The establishment of a wartime economic department in the British cabinet has recently been commented on by well-informed sources here, stating that in the future, Britain and France will fight Germany not only on land, sea, and air, but also economically. French economic experts have arrived in London and have begun to cooperate with officials from the British wartime economic department to achieve coordination. Their main responsibility is to prevent Germany from obtaining the raw materials necessary for the war. Regarding this, Germany is in the same vulnerable position as in 1914. It is reported that they intend to purchase the raw materials they need through certain countries that have declared strict neutrality, in order to supplement their supplies. This type of method is worthy of attention. In addition, Germany's overall economic situation is extremely precarious. For example, in recent months, there has been a shortage of fuel, which will surely be felt during the war. This is one point. There are also many shortcomings in railway transportation, which can be seen from the official reports released over the past year. This is another point. During the last European war, the German railway organization was very good, and troops could often be transported from the east and west fronts overnight. Today, it is much inferior. The German authorities probably also know that it is difficult to fight on both fronts if transportation is not smooth, and they have not hesitated to admit that they want to end the war on the Eastern Front as soon as possible. At sea, the British and French navies have a great advantage, and it is not difficult to blockade the German coast. In just a few days after the start of the war, several German cargo ships have already been sunk. In addition, Egypt and Iraq have declared a severance of relations with Germany, which is very important. Germany has economic ambitions in the eastern Mediterranean. Given that Germany is the top trading partner in Turkey and the second largest trading partner in Egypt, this decision by Egypt and Iraq is a major blow to Germany. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### German Government Requisitions Private Leather

Berlin: The newspapers here report that leather stored by private individuals will be requisitioned by the government in its entirety, and merchants are not allowed to trade freely. At the same time, similar measures will be taken for the textile industry in the near future. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### London Stock Market Market Conditions Stable

London: The London Stock Exchange is scheduled to open today, so the volume of off-hours trading yesterday was very small, but prices remained stable. Cotton was the only major commodity market that was open. Demand in the Liverpool cotton market was recovering, but prices hovered around the closing price on Sunday, so sellers were unwilling to sell, and transactions were limited. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### United States Exports of Aircraft in July

Washington: The U.S. Department of Commerce announced today that U.S. aircraft exports to foreign countries in July were 43 to France, 42 to Britain, and 10 to Canada. During the same period, the U.S. exported 67 aircraft engines to Britain and 50 to France. (Associated Press dispatch, 7th)

Editorial

### The United States' Neutrality and England, France, and the Far East

Three days after England and France declared war on Germany, U.S. President Roosevelt signed a declaration of neutrality, which Secretary of State Hull was ordered to announce; at the same time, the Neutrality Act was implemented. The declaration of neutrality lists seventeen articles, based on international law and the U.S. Neutrality Act; a special department was established under the State Department to implement the executive orders, and the Department of Justice was ordered to enforce the law. The most noteworthy aspect is that the current U.S. Neutrality Act strictly prohibits the supply of munitions to belligerent countries; the political struggle in the last U.S. Congress used this as a tool, developing into a struggle over American foreign policy. In essence, the key point is: American foreign policy, toward the Americas and the Far East, is almost unanimous across the country, with no partisan differences; toward Europe, some advocate isolation, others favor closer ties with England. Those who advocate isolation argue for maintaining the current Neutrality Act, which strictly prohibits the supply of munitions to any belligerent country; those who favor closer ties with England not only advocate providing England with conveniences but also believe that it should be given substantial assistance. President Roosevelt is trying to strike a balance, advocating for amending the Neutrality Act while leaving room for flexibility; this is the general situation.

It is impossible and unnecessary for the United States to immediately join this European war at the outset. There are two other options: one, immediately declare neutrality and implement the Neutrality Act, as is being done today; and then, depending on the development of the situation, decide whether to convene a special session of Congress to amend the Neutrality Act, in order to help the democratic nations of England and France in Europe resist aggression. The second option is to temporarily not declare neutrality, while providing any belligerent country with the convenience of purchasing munitions in the United States, and then calmly convene Congress, leveraging the innate emotional connection between the United States and England, to promote the passage of the Neutrality Act amendment, and then declare neutrality; based on past precedent, President Wilson did not declare neutrality until more than a hundred days after the outbreak of the war in Europe during the First World War, so it is said that there is no need to rush to declare neutrality now.

Now, President Roosevelt has resolutely decided to declare neutrality instead of taking the second path. What is the reason for this? Is it a sign of defeat in political struggle? Is it an indifferent attitude, without favoring or disliking England and France versus Germany, standing by and watching the outcome? None of these are true. I believe that the United States' hasty declaration of neutrality, in addition to the general reasons for any country declaring neutrality in international wars, based on our inner feelings and the conclusions drawn from objective facts, is due to President Roosevelt's unique and painstaking efforts; there are two reasons related to domestic politics, two reasons related to the actual needs of England and France, and one reason related to the overall international policy of the United States, which requires deep understanding and thorough reflection from England and France; only with these five points can one declare neutrality immediately without hesitation.

Why do I say this? President Roosevelt has foresight, integrity, and possesses the qualities of a great statesman. He has insightful and genuine knowledge of international developments and the amendment of the Neutrality Act; when the European war had not yet begun, he was already constrained by the isolationists in Congress, and now that the war has broken out, he can still retain the great power to declare neutrality, using the safety of the United States and its people in the European war as a bet, to drive members of Congress to accept the Neutrality Act amendment; manipulating the situation in this way, seeking solutions through changes, is what general politicians excel at, but President Roosevelt respects the essence of the rule of law, urgently addressing what the country and its people urgently need, preferring to delay amendment and prioritize neutrality; this is the demeanor of a great statesman, one reason related to politics. The isolationist faction is relatively isolated, but their alarmist rhetoric is enough to influence a portion of public opinion; considering the long-term safety of the United States and the feelings of the American people toward England, the isolationist faction is indeed a fringe rather than the mainstream; therefore, rather than hastily submitting the Neutrality Act amendment to a special session of Congress and fighting with the isolationist faction, it is better to calmly submit it to the judgment of the people's conscience, waiting for public opinion to mature; this is the ultimate principle of democratic politics, another reason related to politics. The military equipment and all other strengths of England and France can be said to be deep-rooted and long-lasting, which cannot be matched by a rapidly rising nation; at the beginning of the war, their reserves are still abundant, and they do not urgently need to seek replenishment from the United States; therefore, the United States' declaration of neutrality today, prohibiting the export of munitions, does not affect the war effort of England and France; this is one reason related to the actual needs of England and France. Moreover, what the U.S. Neutrality Act prohibits is the supply of munitions to belligerent countries; countries that are not in a state of war are not prohibited from purchasing munitions by the U.S. Neutrality Act; England and France are united, and the British colonies and dominions have successively declared a state of war with Germany following England, but Canada is an exception; Canada is one of the pillars of Great Britain and is adjacent to the United States; therefore, although the United States implements the Neutrality Act, England and France can still purchase American munitions from Canada; this does not hinder the actual needs of England and France, another reason. From these four points, it can be seen that the United States' neutrality today is not only not detrimental to England and France but also maintains its traditional closeness with England and France. However, granting or withholding, facilitating or obstructing, still depends on how the authority wields its power; President Roosevelt is the embodiment of American authority; granting and facilitating what is in line with American policy is within the president's power; withholding and obstructing what is contrary to American policy is also within the president's power. How the United States treats England and France is one part of American international policy, and how it treats the Far East is another part; Secretary of State Hull said in a statement yesterday, "The United States is closely monitoring the situation in the Far East;" at the same time, according to well-informed sources in the United States, "The United States must prioritize Far Eastern interests according to traditional customs;" furthermore, at this time, the United States is strengthening the strength of its Philippine fleet; from all of this, the United States' Far Eastern policy is clearly visible. Therefore, will the convenience that the United States is willing to seek for England and France be weighed against the attitude that England and France take in the Far East? A week ago, this newspaper already said: "Some believe that England and France can win over Japan to offset the defection of the Soviet Union, but in fact, if England and France's actions in the Far East conflict with American policy, then winning over Japan can also offset American sympathy."

The reason why the United States declared neutrality is closely related to the entire international policy of the United States, which requires deep understanding and thorough reflection from England and France.

What needs 'reflection'? The talk of appeasing the Far East by yielding to Japan is rife!

### U.S. Authorities Announce Close Attention to the Far East Situation, Dispatch Aircraft Carrier to Manila to Prevent Infringement of U.S. Neutrality Rights

Washington - Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the United States is closely monitoring the situation in the Far East and has been paying close attention to Japan's request for British and French troops to withdraw from China. Well-informed sources also said that the actions taken by the U.S. government contain deeper meaning than words. The U.S. fleet is currently concentrated in the Pacific, and the aircraft carrier "Langley" has been ordered to sail to Manila to enhance the strength of the Asian fleet. The U.S. Far East policy will not change, and according to traditional customs, Far Eastern interests must be prioritized, (U.S. Associated Press dispatch, 7th)

Washington - The U.S. Navy ordered the aircraft carrier "Langley," stationed at Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands, last night to immediately proceed to the Philippines to strengthen the U.S. Asian fleet. According to sources in Honolulu, the "Langley" will sail to the Philippines today with naval personnel and aircraft. Naval officials claimed that the "Langley" was dispatched to protect the bays and entrances of the Philippines to prevent violations of the U.S. Neutrality Act. Well-informed sources said that the Navy has adopted special alert measures to prevent neutral actions within U.S. territory and possessions. The U.S. actions in the Philippines should not be regarded as military actions in the Far East. Government officials here claimed that strengthening the U.S. Asian fleet is an internal matter of implementing the Neutrality Act, which local authorities cannot handle. Naval authorities have also stepped up patrols along the U.S. coast to curb violations of the Neutrality Act. Naval officials said that the Navy Department has not yet ordered the strengthening of U.S. Far Eastern fortresses. Currently, in addition to constructing already approved three-year plan projects and increasing necessary construction personnel, surveyors, and inspectors, there have been no increases in personnel and aircraft in remote Pacific bases. Most bases cannot be used on a large scale until construction is completed. All parts of the U.S. Navy have been ordered to cooperate to ensure U.S. neutrality. Naval officials recalled the many difficulties in implementing neutrality in the Philippine Islands, because the coastline there is very long and difficult to monitor. Belligerent countries may attempt to use many small bays in the Philippines as naval aircraft bases, or use Philippine ports for refueling and supply. The Air Force belonging to the Asian fleet has been ordered to implement President Roosevelt's regulations prohibiting belligerent warships from staying in ports for more than 24 hours and preventing fuel increases of more than one in three months. The Navy must prevent any belligerent country from using the Philippines and attempting to hinder American maritime commerce. Maintaining neutrality is the duty of the American troops in the Far East, (U.S. Associated Press dispatch, 7th)

### U.S. Navy Department Manages Panama Canal and Dispatches Warships to Patrol U.S. Waters

Washington - President Roosevelt recently ordered the Navy Department to dispatch warships to patrol U.S. waters to monitor the actions of warships of various European belligerent countries. According to White House Secretary Early, this measure is of a precautionary nature, and details cannot be disclosed. In addition, the President also issued an order placing the Panama Canal under the management of the War Department. According to War Secretary Woodring, this measure has been under consideration for some time, and its purpose is to ensure the safety of the canal during this period of international tension, (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### Details of the Athena Disaster, British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill Reports in the House of Commons

London - First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill announced in the House of Commons today regarding the sinking of the British 13,456-ton merchant ship Athena by a German submarine off the west coast of Scotland on September 4. He said that according to the sworn testimony given by the ship's first mate and rescued British and American citizens, the ship was sunk by a German submarine without warning. Based on current knowledge, the number of victims may be greater than previously reported. There were 1,480 people on board, including 326 crew members and 1,102 passengers. 125 people are still missing. At 7:45 p.m. that day, the ship's port engine room was hit by a torpedo. Then, the German submarine surfaced and fired the first shot at the ship, and the shells exploded on the deck. At this point, the submarine circled the gradually sinking Athena, and was seen by many passengers. Rescued American passengers also stated in their sworn testimony that they had seen the German submarine. The exact number of casualties is still unknown. How many people died in the first bombing, and how many people drowned due to the capsizing of the lifeboats, cannot be estimated. In addition to those rescued by two British destroyers and the merchant ships Nelson and Flintshire, a large Swedish yacht also rescued some people. As far as is known, about 125 people are missing, some of whom may be on the Swedish yacht. The Athena was not equipped with self-defense weapons, did not carry artillery, and its deck was not prepared for carrying artillery. He expressed deep sympathy to the families of the victims. The German submarine did not give a warning before bombing the Athena, leaving people unprepared to escape. The treatment that British warships gave to the crew and passengers when nearly sinking two German ships was completely different. British warships first tried to preserve the lives of the people on board, and then sank the ship. The New York Post, a neutral newspaper, once reported that German crew members were able to calmly pack their belongings into lifeboats, and that a German ship captain expressed gratitude for the treatment given by British warships when arriving at a port in Uruguay. The difference between British and German benevolence and violence is such, Churchill said. Churchill then answered a question from a member of Parliament, saying that there is no doubt that the Athena sailed out before Britain declared war, and it is also very clear that the German submarine must have been lurking in the sea at that time, waiting to attack, (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

The association requires the company to insure each member for $25,000 in life insurance, and to increase wages by $250 per month, and to increase the number of sailors on each ship by 40%. Sailors in Boston held a strike to protest this matter. Negotiations may be resolved before the President Roosevelt returns to the U.S. (U.S. Associated Press dispatch, 7th)

Therefore, the Australian government cannot encourage its people to serve overseas at this stage. The Union can only provide practical assistance in commercial, shipping, and financial matters.

### Germany's Attitude Toward Southeastern Europe

Berlin - Regarding Germany's relations with Southeastern European countries, according to a diplomatic correspondent for the Berliner Börsen-Zeitung, Germany has no intention of making the atmosphere in the Southeast more tense. The development of German actions in Eastern Europe proves that the German-Polish dispute did not cause a reaction from the countries in the Danube River basin, which suits the Germans' initial wishes and intentions. Germany's close relations with Southeastern European countries actually have a need to promote peace in Southeastern Europe. Germany attaches more importance to its neutrality in other countries' actions than to its words, (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

The enemy has been defeated and is retreating across the entire front. The rapid achievement of this initial success is entirely due to the dedication of all officers and soldiers, and the protection provided by the Air Force. I express my deep appreciation. This is a major achievement in the history of the German Army. After our army conquered Krakow, the tomb of the late General Pilsudski fell into our hands. Although Pilsudski led the Polish army in the First World War, his policy goals were entirely based on peace with Germany. The German army should respect this great soldier. At the same time, in accordance with the Führer's order, a guard of honor has been formed at his tomb. The greatest achievements still depend on the completion by all soldiers. It is hoped that you will pursue and annihilate the enemy to achieve complete victory. The entire German people will fully support you. The Führer and the supreme commander will be your role models with the greatest determination. Let us all strive forward to achieve victory. There is great hope for this." (Haitong dispatch, 7th)

### Germany is Isolated and Helpless - Creating an Atmosphere of a Four-Power Alliance - Japan Denies Negotiating with the Soviet Union - Britain Values Japan's Neutrality

London - According to the Intelligence Department, the Japanese government has notified British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie that Japan does not intend to participate in the current European war. The Japanese government requested that the British side not take any measures that would be detrimental to Japan's position in China. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

London - Following Japan's declaration of neutrality in the European war, political figures here unanimously stated that this move is of great significance. Although Germany's manpower resources may seem inexhaustible, the main problem lies in the supply of materials. In order to prevent Germany from obtaining various raw materials from overseas, the British fleet must conduct large-scale searches in all oceans. Now that Japan has maintained neutrality, Britain can concentrate most of its warships in European waters to blockade Germany, which will be more effective. In addition, Spain's neutrality is also of great significance. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

Tokyo - The cabinet meeting to be held today and tomorrow will discuss the draft of the new cabinet's policy platform. If it is approved, it will be announced.

It is expected that the government will declare a unitary policy centered on the China Incident for a considerable period of time. It also stated that the Japanese government will assist the new central regime about to be established in China. After the establishment of that regime, the Japanese government will adjust Sino-Japanese relations with it and promote the work of establishing a new order in East Asia. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

Danzig - Newspapers here have printed news from the German side in large characters, claiming that a new axis of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan is being organized, led by Berlin. To this end, a Soviet military delegation is in Berlin for discussions. An Italian military delegation is expected to arrive in Berlin soon, and negotiations on a non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan are being conducted simultaneously with this activity. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

Moscow - It is rumored that Japanese Ambassador to Moscow, Shigenori Tōgō, held talks with People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Vyacheslav Molotov, yesterday. Both sides sought solutions to the conflicts in the Outer Mongolia region. Japanese sources here denied this, saying that Ambassador Tōgō did not see Molotov, nor was a meeting scheduled. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Chongqing - Regarding the news of a meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Tōgō, well-informed Chinese sources here stated that it is impossible for the Soviet Union and Japan to sign a non-aggression pact, at least not at present. It is believed that unless the Soviet Union and Japan reach a compromise on various outstanding issues between them, such as the situation on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border, Japanese fishing rights in Sakhalin, and oil exploitation rights, such a pact is unlikely to be concluded. Currently, the Soviet-Japanese negotiations are mainly aimed at discussing a temporary ceasefire agreement for the current war in the Nomonhan region. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

Tokyo - The Tokyo Stock Exchange saw a surge in market prices on Monday due to the European war.

However, confidence remained strong, especially for textiles and rayon stocks, which were still 1 to 4 yen higher than before. At the same time, the price of raw silk in New York reached a new high of 1,500 yen per 100-pound bale, forcing the Yokohama Silk Exchange to suspend trading. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

New York - It is reported that Japanese merchants are preparing to order machinery worth 10 million yuan to fill the facilities of a truck factory in the Americas. The Japanese merchants originally planned to order from Germany, but now they have changed to purchasing from the United States. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

London - Well-informed sources here recently stated that after the establishment of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, relations between Britain and Japan are expected to improve in the shortest possible time. Although the Chinese currency issue may pose an obstacle, a compromise solution may be found to avoid a concrete resolution for the time being, so that Britain and Japan can achieve the desire for appeasement in the Far East. This compromise plan is being studied by the British government and will be discussed informally with the Japanese government. As of now, after mutually testing opinions, both sides have entered a state of "spiritual disarmament." In the future, various thorny issues can be discussed in a favorable environment. However, the main principles on which British Far Eastern policy is based will not be forced to be abandoned. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### German Authorities Unwilling to Expand War - Intent on Reconciling with France

Basel, Switzerland - Swiss newspapers have published messages from correspondents stationed in Berlin, all stating that German officials are still emphasizing that the scope of the war will not expand. The Basler Nachrichten reported, "German officials have recently been propagating to domestic and neutral countries' public opinion that Britain and France are assisting Poland without the determination to fight to the end." A spokesman for the German government, based on the slogan "Germany has no demands on France," gave a speech to reporters from neutral newspapers, saying that the German army does not intend to take the offensive on the Western Front and will limit itself to retaliation against Britain. According to the German officials' intentions, they deeply hope that the scope of the war will not expand, but the generalization of military action is inevitable. It will be seen that German public opinion will be greatly disappointed, which can be asserted. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Berlin - General opinion here does not seem to hold ill will towards France. It is generally believed that France's involvement in the war is entirely due to Britain's control. The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the "German Foreign Policy Correspondence," stated that the final stage of Anglo-German negotiations was unfortunately not notified to France. Otherwise, it would be known that France also accepted the Italian mediation, the same as Germany. The responsibility for the war should be entirely borne by Britain. Although France's position is not threatened by Germany today, it has been forced to prepare to attack Germany. The newspaper stated that the German nation is willing to resolve the century-old feud with France and reconcile. However, if France attacks without reason, it will eliminate the hope of extending peace between the two countries for hundreds of years. (Haitong dispatch, 7th)

### German Battlefield Deaths and Injuries Secretly Not Announced

Danzig - A Danish newspaper's Berlin correspondent reported that the German authorities refused to announce the names of the dead and wounded. When German soldiers die in battle, the authorities often notify their families and strictly order them not to tell others or hold mourning ceremonies. The correspondent visited Saarbrücken and said that the city was lifeless, and all the women and children had been evacuated. They traveled by train during the evacuation, which was extremely crowded. A small compartment of the train had as many as thirty-two people. The only sign of activity was the French searchlights sweeping the sky every night. German newspapers stated that several Germans were listening to absolutely prohibited foreign broadcasts, and they were telling others what they had heard. These people have committed a crime against the entire German people and are now being detained awaiting judgment. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### Anti-War Demonstrations Discovered in Germany

It is reported that powerful Black Guards have been dispatched from Dresden and Leipzig to Bohemia and Moravia. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### The Last Scene of Anglo-Franco-German Diplomacy - German Side Publishes Documents

Berlin - Foreign Minister Ribbentrop met with the French Ambassador to Germany, Coulondre, on September 3 and held important talks. Today, the authorities published the following communiqué on the content of the talks, which stated: "When the French people learned that German Führer Hitler and French Prime Minister Daladier had exchanged letters, the French government still attempted to conceal the final state of diplomatic negotiations from the public. Therefore, except for a few well-informed people, the general public did not know that the French government had agreed to the Italian mediation plan. (According to the Italian mediation plan, Germany was also satisfied and accepted it.) Therefore, the French people did not know that the breakdown of the last chance for peace was due to Britain's tough stance. Britain did not hesitate to obstruct the Italian mediation plan and insisted on Germany's immediate withdrawal from the liberated area. Britain even put pressure on France, forcing it to adopt the same tough stance. Therefore, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's efforts ultimately failed. On the morning of September 3, British Ambassador to Germany Henderson presented a note from his government to Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, demanding that German troops withdraw from Poland within two hours, and informed him that if Germany rejected this final note, Britain would take military action. At 12:20 on the same day, French Ambassador Coulondre also visited Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at the Foreign Ministry. The official documents of Britain and France were not consistent on the time, which shows that the attitudes of Britain and France towards Germany were not entirely the same. However, at the final moment, France bowed to Britain and accepted its political leadership. The French people will certainly be happy to hear about the content of the talks between Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Ambassador Coulondre on September 3. At that time, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop clearly explained to Ambassador Coulondre the reasons why Germany rejected Britain's final ultimatum and handed him a memorandum on the matter. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop said, "If France's attitude towards Germany is the same as that of Britain, the German government can only regret it. Germany will work to promote understanding between Germany and France, and has never intended to invade France. If France ignores Germany's efforts to build understanding, the French people will sacrifice their lives on the German Western Front." At that time, the note presented by French Ambassador Coulondre stated that France would be forced to fulfill its obligations to Poland from 5 pm on September 3. Accordingly, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop reiterated to Ambassador Coulondre that Germany did not intend to attack France. If France attacks Germany, France should be responsible for the losses caused by this war." (Haitong dispatch, 7th)

Berlin - Last night, the German authorities issued a white paper explaining the final stage of the German-Polish crisis. "At the beginning of August, Germany learned that Poland and Danzig had exchanged notes. Poland demanded that the Danzig Senate revoke the order involving the actions of Polish customs inspectors. Therefore, on August 9, the German government warned the Polish government that if such a strict demand was made again, relations between Germany and Poland would deteriorate, and the situation would be very serious and should not be ignored. If there were any changes, the Polish government should be responsible. The next day, the Polish government replied to the German Embassy in Poland with a note, the main point of which was that if the German government intervened in the Danzig incident, the Polish government would consider it an act of aggression, because the Danzig incident seriously disregarded Poland's rights and interests in the Free City of Danzig. On August 22, British Prime Minister Chamberlain wrote to Führer Hitler, solemnly stating Britain's determination to fulfill its promise to Poland and stating that negotiations should be conducted to reach a mutually agreeable solution to the German-Polish dispute to establish an internationally guaranteed agreement. Hitler replied on the 23rd, explaining the causes of the German-Polish crisis and refuting the inaccuracies of rumors circulating in Britain about Germany's mobilization against Poland and its aggressive plans against Hungary and Romania. Then, he explained that the result of Britain and France guaranteeing Poland was not only to encourage the Polish government to reject Germany's demands, but also to fuel Poland's arrogance, leading to the adoption of terrorist actions against the German minority in Poland. Hitler reiterated that no one could prevent Germany from protecting its vital interests. Although the British Prime Minister's letter and the speeches made by British political figures the following day failed to understand Germany's views, Führer Hitler still intended to make another attempt to establish an agreement with Britain. On August 25, Hitler met with British Ambassador to Germany Henderson, explained Germany's views in detail, and handed Henderson an outline of Germany's plan to propose a permanent understanding between Britain and Germany after resolving the Danzig and Corridor issues. While the British government was considering the above-mentioned note, Führer Hitler exchanged letters with French Prime Minister Daladier. In his reply, Hitler clearly expressed Germany's attitude towards Poland to Daladier and reiterated his determination to maintain the existing borders between Germany and France. The British government replied to Germany's note of August 25 on August 28, stating that it was willing to consider adjusting Anglo-German relations and informing it that the Polish government was willing to conduct direct negotiations with Germany. Britain proposed that the agreement signed by Germany and Poland should be guaranteed internationally. Although the Polish government's past attitude made it inevitable to suspect its statement, Führer Hitler still replied to British Ambassador Henderson on the afternoon of August 29, stating that Germany accepted Britain's proposal and hoped that Poland would send responsible personnel to Berlin on August 30 to discuss the matter. Hitler reiterated that the German government would draft a solution and send it to the British government for consideration when the Polish plenipotentiary ambassador arrived in Berlin. However, by August 30, the Polish negotiator had not arrived in Berlin, and the British government had not shown any intention of conducting negotiations. The German government authorities only received news of Poland's mobilization and received a British memorandum in the evening, which only stated that the German reply would be forwarded to Poland. At that time, the German government still planned to hold talks based on the outline, but Polish Ambassador Lipski verbally informed German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop that Poland was considering the issue of direct negotiations, but said that there were no new instructions. Germany waited in vain for two days and then announced the sixteen-point German proposal on August 31. The Polish radio station deemed it unacceptable. Since all peaceful methods had completely failed, the Führer was forced to resort to force to seek the liberation of the German minority and the city of Danzig, and to prevent repeated invasions of German territory. On the evening of August 31, the British and French ambassadors presented a note to the German government, stating that if German troops did not withdraw from Poland, Britain and France would fulfill their obligation to guarantee assistance. The German Foreign Minister stated that Germany rejected this suggestion from Britain and France. When Italian Prime Minister Mussolini proposed mediation, Germany expressed acceptance, but the speeches of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax indicated rejection. Therefore, Mussolini's efforts for peace have been destroyed by Britain. At 9 am on September 3, the British Ambassador to Germany submitted a memorandum to the German Foreign Ministry, demanding the withdrawal of troops in Poland within two hours. At 11:15 am on the same day, British Foreign Secretary Halifax informed the German Chargé d'Affaires that London believed that it had entered a state of war with Germany. On the other hand, the German Foreign Ministry also notified the British Ambassador at 11 am on the same day that Germany could not accept the British ultimatum, and Britain should bear any responsibility for causing the war. At noon on the same day, the French Ambassador also submitted a memorandum to Germany, demanding the withdrawal of German troops in Poland by 5 pm, otherwise France would be forced to assist Poland. The German Foreign Ministry stated that if France wanted to attack Germany, France should bear all the painful responsibility. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)

### Japanese Ministry of Finance Decides to Maintain the Exchange Rate with the Pound Sterling

Tokyo. Today's Asahi Shimbun reported that the Japanese Ministry of Finance is closely observing the development of the international economic situation and believes that there is no sufficient reason to change the link between the pound sterling and the yen for the time being. Therefore, it has decided to maintain the current exchange rate of one yen for one shilling and two pence. As for what kind of treatment the British government will give to the exchange settlement of the pound sterling group or British colonies with third countries, there is no news yet. This is a matter of great importance to Japan's export trade. In terms of the relationship between the yen and the US dollar, there is a question that must be further studied, that is, whether the current exchange rate of two shillings, three pence, six two five for the US dollar is suitable for Japan's economic situation and Japan's trade policy.

### All Circles in Chongqing are Watching the Actions of the Japanese Army

It is Expected that They Will Take the Opportunity to Intensify Pressure. Three Divisions Gathered Downstream of Shashi.

(Chongqing) The Japanese army is currently concentrated in the Hankou area, especially on the north bank of the Yangtze River east of Yichang. It is being closely monitored. Some parties now expect that the Japanese army may take advantage of the opportunity of the European war to make a desperate attempt to rush into the interior. According to the Chinese army, three divisions of the Japanese army have gathered downstream of Shashi. According to unconfirmed news, nine Chinese aircraft flew downstream yesterday. It was not mentioned whether they wanted to bomb the Japanese army concentrated there or just conduct reconnaissance flights. (7th Reuters dispatch)

(7th Reuters dispatch)

(Chongqing) Chinese officials and the general public here are deeply concerned about the Japanese side's request for the withdrawal of British and French land and naval forces in China. The Japanese side's request is obviously a smokescreen for expelling foreign interests in China. The Japanese side's sudden adoption of this attitude towards Britain and France is obviously due to the failure of the pro-British and French policy since the conclusion of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty. It is also sufficient to reveal that Japanese warlords have decided to take advantage of the opportunity of the European war to intensify their military operations against China. However, this request is sufficient to cause armed conflict with other countries. Japan also wants the British army currently stationed in Kowloon to withdraw. Furthermore, Japan will definitely follow the old trick of seizing Qingdao and the Caroline Islands before the last European war, occupying the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the British and French concessions in Hankou and Shanghai, and the Kowloon Peninsula. Afterwards, it will directly threaten Hong Kong and Annam. Chinese officials here believe that Japan's intentions in the South China Sea are to threaten Hong Kong and Hanoi.

### Hong Kong Implements National Defense Law and Strictly Inspects Postal and Telegraph Services

Secret Codes Prohibited; Registration Not Allowed

Hong Kong Correspondence. Since the local authorities promulgated and implemented the National Defense Law on the 26th of last month and conducted postal and telegraph inspections, they temporarily suspended them on the morning of the 27th. In recent days, the European situation has become tense again. The Hong Kong government issued instructions yesterday morning to the postal and telegraph inspection director, Su Lishi, and others to implement this emergency measure again.

Implement Inspections at Various Telegraph Offices. All mail, telegrams, texts, pictures, maps, photos, etc. entering and leaving Hong Kong are subject to inspection to prevent the spread of rumors and communication activities that are detrimental to Hong Kong.

The local authorities may inspect, intercept, or delay delivery. All incoming and outgoing telegrams must not notify the sender. Telegrams sent from Hong Kong to foreign countries are only allowed to be sent in Chinese, English, and French.

Secret Codes Prohibited. The detailed name and address of the sender and receiver must be written on the telegram. Registration is not allowed. As for incoming and outgoing letters and their mail, they are also under the control of the Sike and other responsible personnel, who may open, inspect, and intercept any mail. Telegraph offices will refuse to send any telegrams that do not comply with the procedures. Therefore, telegrams sent to various places yesterday, except for those that followed the procedures, were all returned for registration and secret codes.

### A Military Stronghold in a Strategically Important Location, Hengyang is Progressing Rapidly

Prosperous Market and Busy Transportation; Northern Section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Has Been Dismantled

Hengyang Correspondence. Hengyang is a major town in southern Hunan. Mount Heng, the southern peak, is only a few dozen miles away from here and borders Lechang in Guangdong. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, it has grown up in the smoke of bombing.

The northern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway from here to Changsha has been dismantled, and the materials have been moved to the滇缅路 to build a road connecting international routes. The recently completed Xiang-Gui Railway starts from here and leads directly to Guilin in Guangxi. The vehicles coming and going every day are crowded with people. Military supplies and food are transported by this major artery. It has contributed greatly to the War of Resistance today. Japanese aircraft have dropped many bombs that their people worked hard to accumulate on this road, but the Chinese have a gift for manual labor. After each major destruction, they soon repair it and resume traffic as before.

The third phase of the general battle will soon unfold here. The continuous Mount Heng is hiding countless steel-like fighters. Many mountain peaks have been built into steel fortresses according to the strategic importance of the mountains and rivers. In the future battle, they will surely promote their tenacity and perform many earth-shattering achievements.

Since the successive fall of Hankou and Nanchang, Changsha, under the threat of Japanese artillery fire, has promoted its original value, and this place has taken Changsha's place. Now, the battlefront of Gan and E, which is under bitter fighting, is supported by this place. The healthy children who are sent to the front line to participate in the war are constantly starting. The people living in Hengyang are very calm and have no fear of the war. The market is bustling with people coming and going. Soldiers, political work teams, and youth groups can be seen everywhere working hard. The roar of the War of Resistance fills every corner. The old Hengyang is growing up in the War of Resistance.

The four problems of clothing, food, housing, and transportation here, except for clothing, which is more expensive due to its reliance on foreign sources, there is no inconvenience in terms of food, housing, and transportation, because the standard of living in the interior is lower than in other cities. Rice can be purchased for ten to twelve kilograms per yuan of national currency, pork for five or six jiao per kilogram, and raw oil for five or six jiao per kilogram. In addition, vegetables are very cheap. However, imported goods and daily necessities have risen to unimaginable prices. As for housing, it can be found everywhere. Although hotels are popular, they are not expensive. In terms of transportation, it is also very convenient except in military areas. There are trains and cars that can be taken to various places. Most people entering the interior take the Xiang-Gui Railway to Guilin in Guangxi, and then transfer to the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. In addition, there is also a Xiang-Gui Highway that leads directly to Guilin. Like the railway, dozens of cars fly on this snake-like highway day and night, coming and going.

### The Situation of the Killing of the Puppet Magistrate of Jiaxing

Innocent Youths Tragically Arrested

Jiaxing Correspondence. In recent times, the Chinese army in the four suburbs of this town has been very active. Therefore, the Japanese army is actively building highways, attempting to facilitate the mobilization of large forces and carry out the so-called "mopping-up" work. Therefore, it instructed the puppet county government to order the puppet workshops and town offices to organize a conscription system to engage in road construction. All those who are seventeen years old or older must serve for three days. If they cannot serve, they must pay a commutation fee of five jiao per day. After this method was implemented, the Chinese side ordered several daredevils to sneak into the city, take the opportunity to drive their own cars, distribute leaflets, advise the people to refuse to serve in the labor force, and hope that the people would leave the occupied area as soon as possible. At the same time, they warned the puppet magistrate, Shen Hanqing, to wake up quickly and stop helping the tiger do evil. However, the puppet police caught a glimpse of it and wanted to arrest them. However, the Chinese daredevils had already driven away. It is said that a puppet policeman chased them to the south gate, but only obtained one car. The matter was heard by the Japanese side, so they ordered a search. Although they found nothing, the residents were very disturbed. After being warned, the puppet magistrate Shen Hanqing still did not repent. The Chinese military authorities then dispatched patriots to come to He City again and lurked near the puppet government to first investigate Shen's daily whereabouts. One day at 7:00 p.m., Shen was taking his eldest son from the puppet county government to his residence. As he was passing near the West County overseas Chinese, he was spotted by Chinese patriots, who took out their pistols and shot Shen continuously. Shen and his eldest son fell to the ground. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, the Chinese patriots left calmly from Xianchang Lane. Later, the puppet police station and the Japanese side sent Shen's father and son to the Beimen Puppet Jiaxing Hospital (formerly the Gospel Hospital) for treatment. However, Shen himself was shot in various vital parts of his body, so he died before reaching the hospital. His son was sent to the hospital, and his injuries were also very serious. After this incident, the entire city was immediately declared under martial law, prohibiting entry and exit, and searching house by house. As of the third day, He City was still under martial law and being searched. It is said that during these three days, more than ten innocent youths were tragically arrested and are currently being interrogated by the Japanese military police.

### Empty Buildings; 100,000 People Have Left Hong Kong

Hong Kong Correspondence. Recently, due to the Japanese army's heavy deployment of troops in Shenzhen, the situation in Hong Kong has been tense. Residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon have been evacuating one after another. According to unofficial statistics, more than 100,000 people have left Hong Kong in the past two weeks. Due to this relationship, there are many empty houses in Hong Kong and Kowloon with red signs saying "For Rent." However, there are very few empty office buildings. As for Macau, due to the sudden increase in population, prices and rents have all soared. Those who fled to Macau also feel the hardship of living in Chang'an.

### Finance
Conflicting reports of positive and negative factors abound; the gold market is extremely chaotic; fluctuating by 580 yuan throughout the day, seemingly detached from currency and operating independently.

Yesterday, spot gold's black market saw even greater volatility. Fluctuations were unpredictable, making it difficult to discern the direction of the market. The market situation was extremely chaotic, with operators taking vastly different approaches. Some bid at 100 yuan, while others offered to sell at several tens of yuan less. Though occurring simultaneously, price differences of tens of yuan were common and considered unsurprising, highlighting the feverish speculation. However, industry sentiment shifted from firm to weary, initially fueled by reports of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan forming an alliance, along with rumors that Chamberlain sought to appease the Far East and compromise with Japan. Coupled with tight foreign exchange, the market opened with a jump of 205 yuan, reaching 4,100 yuan. Subsequently, heavy buying pushed it further to a peak of 4,330 yuan. However, gold firms suddenly took profits, and foreign exchange eased, slightly dampening the bullish momentum, causing it to fluctuate between 4,200 and 4,300 yuan. After 10:30 AM, strong rumors of peace in the Far East emerged, leading to a decline to 4,110 yuan by noon. The afternoon started stable, opening at 4,130 yuan, but a large volume of sales from Hong Kong traders suddenly appeared. Buyers, pressured by the peace rumors and reports of easing foreign exchange, remained hesitant, causing the price to plummet by over 300 yuan to a low of 3,750 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange rate weakened again, and silver shops and money changers successively bought in, pushing the closing price back up to 3,960 yuan. The result was a net increase of 65 yuan compared to the 10th. However, when based on the internal foreign exchange rate and the U.S. dollar settlement price, there was a difference of as much as 1,400 yuan. The value of gold was so volatile, being pushed up and pulled down so rapidly, that it had become independent of currency. Daily trading volume was substantial, exceeding 2,000 taels. Gold jewelry in silver shops continued to rise by 5 yuan. There were no changes in the customs gold price or the prices of various businesses.

### Spot Gold Still Up 65 Yuan

Since this morning, each bar (ten taels) opened with strong market sentiment due to a shrinking foreign exchange report. Buyers swarmed in, aggressively bidding up prices. Sellers held back, watching as the bullish trend became as intense as a charging horse. By 9:25 AM, the opening price was 205 yuan higher than the previous day. Money changers bought 20 taels from silver shops at 4,100 yuan. A Russian gold firm sold 10 taels to money changers at 4,010 yuan, but it couldn't be considered an official market price, as it was difficult to buy even at 4,100 yuan. Rumors were rife in the market, and there was no consensus. Coupled with the shrinking foreign exchange rate, both official and black market, the buying frenzy intensified. Certain silver shops competed to acquire gold for their customers, causing the price to surge. In an instant, it leaped 320 yuan. Securities firms bought 30 taels from silver shops at 4,330 yuan. Afterwards, a certain gold firm suddenly took profits at the high, causing the bullish momentum to falter and dropping prices by 130 yuan. A certain Yu firm sold a total of 50 taels to money changers and fellow firms at 4,200 yuan. Later, money changers absorbed several tens of taels, briefly pushing the price back to 4,230 yuan. Then, a certain gold firm traded 30 taels internally at 4,170 yuan. Later, a certain broker bought 10 taels from a cash firm, pushing the price up to 4,200 yuan. At that time, a certain atmosphere was prevalent in the market, and the foreign exchange rate stopped tightening and started to harden. Securities firms and money changers quickly shifted their focus and rushed to close their positions. Simultaneously, silver shops were also actively selling, dumping gold at 60 yuan. Money changers sold 20 taels to gold firms at 4,140 yuan. It was said that a certain gold firm had a strong appetite and pushed the price back up to 4,190 yuan. Afterwards, because outside sellers had a large number of positions, the price couldn't sustain the increase and fell again. Money changers traded 10 taels internally at 4,110 yuan, setting the closing price for the morning session. The afternoon opened stable. Initially, money changers bought 30 taels from gold firms at 4,130 yuan. There were reports of easing foreign exchange rates and Hong Kong traders taking profits. Furthermore, general buyers were restrained by the peace rumors and remained cautious, causing a lack of support in the market. The price plummeted by 380 yuan. Gold firms and securities firms sold a total of 50 taels to money changers at 3,750 yuan. Afterwards, the foreign exchange rate softened again, and sellers gradually decreased. Money changers and silver shops took advantage of the low prices and aggressively bought in, quickly pushing the price back up by 210 yuan. Silver shops bought 30 taels from money changers at 3,960 yuan, setting the closing price for the evening session. The result was an increase of 65 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 580 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash firms' own-brand gold was 10 yuan higher than spot gold. Spot gold was 55 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.

### Gold Jewelry Adjusted to 400 Yuan

The initial price for gold jewelry at silver shops was 395 yuan per tael. At 9:30 AM, the price increased by 5 yuan, at 9:35 AM it increased again by 20 yuan, then by another 15 yuan after five minutes. At 9:50 AM, it dropped by 10 yuan, and at 10:15 AM, it dropped again by 5 yuan. At noon, it dropped again by 5 yuan. At 2:20 PM, it increased by 5 yuan, and after ten minutes, it decreased by 10 yuan. Shortly after, it decreased again by 10 yuan. At 3:25 PM, it suddenly increased by 5 yuan, and at 4:00 PM, it increased again by 5 yuan. As a result, the price increased by 5 yuan, and the major shops adjusted to 400 yuan, while the new shops set it at 398 yuan. The buy-back price was about 20 yuan less.

### British Pure Gold at 9 Pence

A London dispatch on the 6th stated that British pure gold was at 9 pence, with each ounce costing 8 pounds and 8 shillings. The Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash remained at 1,370.09 yuan. The listed customs gold price remained at 1.707 yuan, and the Shanghai standard gold bar price also remained at 1,366.30 yuan.

### Discount Rate Drops 17.5 Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange suddenly decreased. Initially, it was 165 yuan per thousand yuan, but it decreased to 155 yuan near noon. In the afternoon, it even dropped to 135 yuan before settling at 145 yuan, 17.5 yuan lower than the previous day. The money industry association's overnight lending rate was 20%, both in the morning and afternoon.

### Wild Fluctuations in U.S. Dollar; HSBC Lists at 5.875 Yuan; Black Market Reaches 6.125 Yuan

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw HSBC list at 9:30 AM, reducing the British exchange rate by .25 and the U.S. exchange rate by a fraction. The British gold weight reached the low price of 3 pence 25 on August 26th. The U.S. exchange rate broke the tightest price of 6.0625 yuan on August 26th, creating a new high of 5.875 yuan. With the exception of the German exchange rate, which saw no market, the rest all declined in unison. The black market situation for British and U.S. exchanges was particularly volatile, with a wide range of fluctuations, all based on rumors in the market. It opened slightly soft, with the Nichigyo and Uli firms absorbing significant amounts. In addition, many foreign merchants were repatriating due to the war and settling exchange, coupled with the rumors of Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan forming an alliance, resulting in more buying than selling. It tightened to 3 pence 6875 for British gold and 6.125 yuan for the U.S. exchange. However, the sudden influx of peace rumors caused a shift to oversupply, leading to a tightening. In the afternoon, Hong Kong telegrams were unloaded, easing the rate to 3 pence 90625 and 6.625 yuan. However, Western merchants like Sassoon seized the opportunity to absorb it, causing it to tighten again. The closing price for British gold was 3 pence 84375, and the U.S. exchange was 6.5 yuan. The trend for September futures was the same as the spot market. The daily trading volume was very active. The result was an increase of 15625 for British gold and a decrease of .25 for U.S. exchange compared to the previous day.

### Reduced Absorption at Noon

In the early morning, the London exchange rate was strong, with near-term rising sharply by 2 pence 625 and far-term rising violently by 2 pence 6875. New York silver prices increased by .75. London raw gold was at 9 pence. The exchange rate between Britain and the United States was unchanged. Shanghai against the British was .75 (no market), against the French was unchanged. The United States against Britain decreased by 1.5 cents, against Shanghai decreased by .45 yuan, against the French decreased by 1.25 cents. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price for British gold was 3 pence 96875, and the U.S. exchange was 6.6875 yuan, compared to the previous closing, Britain was tighter by 03125, and the U.S. exchange was softer by .0625. After opening, HSBC absorbed spot British gold at 4 pence from exporters. At that time, Chinese merchants were absorbing as well, but because external supply was very weak, and external banks like Uli and certain banks had very good appetites, the situation softened. When HSBC announced its exchange rates, British exchange decreased by .25, and the U.S. exchange violently decreased by .5 yuan, and the white silver balance tax was calculated at 11.25%. Afterwards, the market frequently reported positive news, and the Japanese bank and foreign merchants absorbed significantly, causing the market to tighten. It was calculated that a certain Japanese bank successively absorbed external spot British gold from 3 pence 875 to 75, and spot U.S. exchange from 6.4375 to 3125. Then, Uli absorbed Huayi's spot British gold at 3 pence 6875. At that time, foreign merchants settled through Datong with spot U.S. exchange at 6.1875 yuan. The tightest exchange ever quoted by a bank was 6.125 yuan.

It was calculated that Hong Kong telegrams sold spot British gold to HSBC, Uli, and other foreign banks from 3 pence 8125 to 90625, and spot U.S. exchange from 6.5 yuan to 625. Afterwards, Sassoon suddenly came to absorb, and the situation reverted to softening.

Extending to the late close, the bank's spot selling price for British gold was 3 pence 84375, and the U.S. exchange was 6.5 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Fluctuations

Yesterday, foreign currency experienced extremely sudden fluctuations. It began with the new four-power axis of Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan reportedly forming an alliance, which caused greater unrest. The buying sentiment was particularly strong, and the U.S. dollar once rose to 15.9 yuan. However, the news of Sino-Japanese peace talks resurfaced, causing it to suddenly fall back to 14.56 yuan, eventually settling at 15 yuan, a rise of 45 fen compared to the previous day.

### Securities
Erratic Fluctuations in Domestic Debt Market; Active Foreign Stocks

The securities black market experienced significant fluctuations yesterday due to numerous rumors. The trend was entirely dictated by European news. However, news often reversed itself shortly after being received. Speculators alternately bought and sold, tiring themselves out. Generally speaking, the news was bad in the morning. Spot cash rose sharply, and government bonds softened. In the afternoon, there were suddenly positive rumors, and market prices turned higher. After the close, the rumor of an alliance between Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan resurfaced, along with peace rumors. Bullish investors had different opinions, and buying sentiment rose again. Class C shares rose as high as 44.2 yuan before falling back several jiao. Public sentiment was extremely chaotic, and it will be difficult to return to normalcy for the time being. Yesterday, Dingkang continued to sell, and Hongkang also inclined to sell. Only retail investors were slightly active. The noon closing was slightly down 2.4 jiao. In the afternoon, No. 25 and No. 56 and retail investors bought more. Hongkang continued to sell, and Lianyi also sold off, but it turned up by 5 to 8 jiao. Overall, it closed up 2 to 5 jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately 800,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.

Stock trading saw 100 shares of Dasheng No. 3 Factory trade at a price of 15 yuan. The Public Chamber of Commerce's stock market report stated that trading remained very active. Rubber stocks were of interest. Though they seemed slow to respond to the recent surge in raw rubber and the easing of foreign exchange, the underlying strength had not weakened. Although the prices of various stocks mostly increased, the scope of trading was quite narrow. Some prices were lower than the morning's highs, and some even fell back, which can be seen as a sign of health. The market's progress and the orderly, peaceful movement are better than rapid and violent movements. Industrial stocks also trended upward. In the afternoon, prices were increasingly firm as the new trading week began. Ewo Cotton Mill stock remained prominent, with 27,000 shares traded.

New York Stocks: A New York dispatch on the 6th stated that the stock market was mixed with slight declines. Market analysts said that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had recently surged by 18%, so a reaction was normal and unsurprising. The price declines were quite orderly, with strong resistance at times. The volume of transactions decreased during the decline, which was reassuring to speculators. Steel stocks led the decline, but some of the losses were recovered before the close. The steel mill operating rate for the week declined due to the Labor Day holiday. It is forecast to increase to 65% next week. At the same time, the market is also paying attention to foreign demand, increased exports, and rising prices. The Dow Jones stock indices were not received.

### Low-Price Rice; Foreign Rice Arrives; Rice Market Full of Selling Sentiment; Indica and Japonica Rice Plunge by Two to Three Yuan

Due to the arrival of low-price foreign rice, the market sentiment weakened. The market was weak from the start of the morning session. However, the opening prices were still high. Japonica rice was still desired at 38 yuan. He Xia early and late rice was 34 yuan. Xin Jian was 30 yuan. However, because most of the local merchants were cautious, the market steadily declined. At the close, Japonica and Jian rice had fallen by two to three yuan each. Gao Xi japonica was 36 yuan, Su Tong japonica was 35 yuan, He Xia early and late rice was 32.3 to 32 yuan, original packaged rice was 34.5 to 33.8 yuan, Jia Shan Jia Xing Xin Chuan Jian was 27 yuan, Yang Tuan Jian was 29 to 28 yuan, Chen Jue Wu Jian was 26 yuan, Xin Jian was 27 yuan, Jiang Bei Xin Jian was 28 to 27.5 yuan. Total transaction volume was only four to five thousand bags. Sources from various regions, He Xia had not yet arrived. Only over three thousand bags of Che Lun Baozi had arrived.

Indica rice: Yesterday, sources continued to pour in. Over five thousand bags arrived via Che Lun. The number of Jiangbei Xin Xian rice arriving was relatively strong. There may be continuous arrivals. Furthermore, 18,000 bags of Saigon rice have already arrived. Market sentiment and prices uniformly declined. The market was full of selling sentiment, with price cuts to quickly unload. Therefore, the selling price of Xin Xian rice suddenly fell by about two yuan, and Chen Xian rice fell by a small yuan and a half. However, after the price decreased slightly, it attracted inquiries from local and suburban shops. Inland merchants also slightly increased their purchases. The after-market trading turned active, and the market stabilized slightly.

### Sudden Movement in Northern Sales; Flour Mill Prices Surge Two Jiao; Wheat Slightly Tightens

Flour: Yesterday, spot flour mill prices surged by two jiao, reaching 6.6 yuan in cash. This was due to a sudden movement in customer sales in North China. Northern merchants were in great need of lower-grade flour due to the Tianjin flood. They offered 4.5 yuan (cash) for Fufeng white bag flour, 5.4 yuan (cash) for Red Liu Hai flour, and the transaction volume of No. 2 flour and others was close to 100,000 bags. Local purchases were also higher than the previous day. Market sentiment was upward, and the market rose sharply. It was reported that the total number of cargo warehouse receipts currently circulating in the market was only 30,000 to 50,000 bags. The goods sold by the various mills must be delivered immediately. Therefore, the price of returned flour rose with the market, still higher than the mill price by about 1 jiao.

Wheat: Also improved. Chang Xi Jing Zhen sources were abundant. Mill purchases were not quiet either. It was also reported that the flour market's customer sales were active, and the mill price had increased by two jiao. Speculators also continued to buy, but the buying was limited, and the market was not easily improved. The result was a slight tightening. Speculators throughout the city purchased over ten truckloads, and Fuxin and Fufeng mills jointly purchased 7,500 to 7,600 bags. The highest price was 10 yuan and 8 fen, falling to 9.2 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton
Suspension of Coastal Defense Transport; Yarn Market Wants to Rise But Is Hindered

The yarn market started to calm down, and the trend slightly eased. The prices that had soared wildly in the past two days were already substantial, prompting some profit-takers to sell. As a result, the market turned calmer. However, those who had made money in exchange bills reorganized and came back to purchase, and the situation suddenly became tense. Therefore, market prices rose and fell, becoming more erratic. Currently, the yarn market should naturally rise due to the situation with foreign cotton, but there is a severe shortage of transport ships on all routes. The goods purchased by customers cannot be loaded, and the coastal defense, the only transportation hub connecting the mainland, has completely suspended operations.

The spot yarn market opened with a peaceful situation in the morning because the previous day's momentum had exploded. After a while, a certain major dealer came back to the market to absorb yarn, and it was reported that the black market foreign exchange had decreased again, and the price of gold had soared. The buying trend immediately started again. The spot price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn rose from 675 yuan to 700 yuan. The warehouse receipt price rose from 635 yuan to 648 yuan. By the time of closing, profit-takers sold off, and the price fell back by 15 yuan. According to statistics, the half-day transaction volume was 1,550 bales. The market price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn rose by 5 yuan, Mu Yang yarn rose by 5 yuan, Tian Nv yarn fell by 3 yuan, and Shuang Di Qiu yarn fell by 7 yuan. Today, 65 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Yantai. The amounts purchased by each trade group are listed as follows:

In the afternoon, the news that the black market foreign exchange rose slightly and the securities market rose back was unfavorable to the yarn market, and the momentum turned calm.

### Amidst Soaring Foreign Cotton Prices, Chinese and Foreign Cotton Trading Is Very Active

Spot cotton trading developed greatly, because overseas cotton prices rose uniformly, coupled with foreign exchange shrinkage, causing industry sentiment to be firm and transactions to be frequent. As for the yarn mills, Japanese merchants had a strong buying intent, because their cotton inventory was insufficient, and the market price of Japanese yarn also soared, so they replenished purchases from time to time. Indian cotton prices rose by another 6 yuan. According to industry insiders, Chinese factories such as Shenxin No. 29 Factory, Hongzhang, Xinyu, and Anda factories had ample storage and had no urgent need to purchase. The source of Xintong cotton has been slightly stagnant recently, and the selling price has risen daily. 450 bales arrived, and the asking price was 110 yuan. Yesterday, another 156 bales arrived, and the asking price was 115.6 yuan. 200 to 300 bales were traded. 60 bales of new cotton from Beisha and 250 pieces of foreign Pingguo er cotton of 10 count coarse yarn from Jiu Yuan Zhu Wen were traded at a price of 108.25 yuan. The opening prices for spot cotton sales are recorded on the left.

Another message states that foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has become active. In addition to Japanese factories already purchasing in large quantities, traders are also searching and purchasing from all directions, so the selling price is very firm and expensive. The selling price of Brazilian cotton is over 180 yuan, and American cotton of 42 counts is being offered at over 120 yuan, and the seller is unwilling to sell. Therefore, it is predicted that cotton prices will rise across the board if there are no changes in the political situation in all regions.

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market telegram did not arrive yesterday, but according to a private telegram, the cotton market was quite active yesterday due to the unusually firm sentiment and rising stock market prices. It opened and rose by over 10 pounds, and the cotton price was consistently very firm due to the speculator's aggressive purchases. The result of the closing price was a rise of 25 pounds compared to the previous day. The Liverpool cotton market was flat. India had been rising sharply for consecutive days, but it had become calmer yesterday, and the forecast rose by 1 rupee. Egypt rose by over 20 pounds.

### Piece Goods
Dyeing Costs Are About To Increase; White Goods Trading Is Very Active

Yesterday the market situation was still good. Wenzhou merchants have special ships for trial voyages within days, and demand has suddenly increased. The local colored cloth shops, because the dyeing costs in dyeing factories are about to increase greatly, Dong Pi rises and increases very quickly, the national cloth is relatively cheaper, so continuous absorption has been strong for consecutive days, and they are rushing to dye early and store goods for sale, so the selling price has been raised uniformly again. White goods, fine cloth, and coarse cloth rose by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half per bolt. Colored cloth and colored twill rose by 2 jiao to 5 jiao per bolt. The local market traded over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, colored twill, broadcloth, and flannel. Wenzhou merchants purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill from Yihua and other factories.

Dong Pi

The morning market's bullish trend continued, and the high price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was called at 19.5 yuan per bolt. Merchants also opened orders from foreign firms for fine cloth and fine twill, totaling about 1,000 pieces. The market price of five-width fine cloth was set at 17.5 yuan, Shanghai color ball was 19.35 yuan, and Flying Fish fine cloth was 19 yuan, all higher than the current market. In the afternoon, public sentiment was weak due to rumors from all sides, and the market price fell back. The doing price of Dragon Head fine cloth was 19 yuan, but the demand for dyed fine twill remained strong, and it was still 2.5 jiao higher per bolt compared to yesterday.

Export

195 pieces of piece goods were transported to Yantai on the 8th, and 3 pieces were transported to Tianjin.

### Sugar Market
Sugar Prices Keep Rising

Yesterday, the tight trend in the sugar market had not weakened. According to a Dutch telegram, the price of raw white sugar for immediate loading was 8.70 guilders. The local public association set the price of 24 raw white sugar at 53 yuan, an increase of 7 jiao for wooden warehouses, 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan for outside warehouses. The initial market was 52.5 yuan, and then it also reached 53 yuan. The price of re-exported goods was still 40 yuan. Taikoo wheeled white sugar rose by over 1 yuan, the B-marked sugar in the western warehouse was 58 yuan to 57.5 yuan, the rest was as before, the H-marked wheeled red sugar rose by 0.5 yuan, to 39 yuan, Dutch red sugar rose by 1 yuan, the spot price was 41 yuan (cash), the re-export price was 35 yuan (cash), local cotton white rose by 1 yuan, Zhen Ji Hao No. 2 was 52.5 yuan, No. 3 was 52 yuan, No. 4 was 51.5 yuan, local No. 1 rock sugar rose by 2 yuan, to 57.5 yuan, Jing Ming rock sugar was 59 yuan, national currency heard that 200 bales of Huizhou white had been traded, and the price was 57 yuan, discount as agreed, Diao Qing price called as before, and there was absolutely no loose intent.

### Caolu Visits British and French Naval Officers, Frequent Contacts in Diplomatic Circles, British Association in China Vows Loyalty to Motherland, French Ambassador's Wife Forms Women's慰劳团

The European war has been erupting for nearly a week. This port, being a gathering place for Chinese and foreigners, has shown some signs of stagnation in business in China due to the conscription for military service and the enthusiastic participation of nationals from various countries. Diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in Shanghai have been visiting each other frequently in recent days. The Japanese naval representative visited the British and French naval authorities to state his country's position. Madame Gosselin, the French ambassador's wife, is organizing a French侨妇女慰劳团 (comfort group). Regarding the transportation of passengers and goods between Europe and Asia, it has been learned that British ships have temporarily changed their routes, while Italian ships have increased freight rates. Swiss ships, adhering strictly to neutrality, refuse to carry people from belligerent countries. The details of these situations are as follows:

Caolu Visits British and French Officers

Rear Admiral Caolu, Chief of Staff of the Japanese China Fleet, visited the British and French naval commanders the day before yesterday afternoon, representing Commander Oikawa of the Japanese China Fleet in stating his country's position on the European war situation. Consul General Miura of Japan also visited the consuls general of Britain, France, and Germany on the same day to make certain statements. It is reported that the diplomatic activities of Japanese military and political personnel stationed in Shanghai are receiving unanimous attention from all parties.

British Association Holds Emergency Meeting

The Shanghai General Association of the British Association in China, in response to the expansion of the European war and Britain's declaration of war on Germany, convened an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 5th to discuss the attitude and steps to be taken in the future and how to seek mutual communication. It was decided to send representatives to consult with the British authorities stationed in Shanghai. According to the North China Daily News, the General Committee of the British Association in China held a special meeting on Tuesday to review the situation in this port caused by the European declaration of war and recorded the association's willingness to act in accordance with the instructions of the British authorities at any time.

French Ambassador's Wife Organizes Comfort Group

Madame Gosselin, the wife of the French Ambassador to China, believing that women should also serve their country during the European war, is leading the French women residing in Shanghai to organize a women's comfort group to慰劳 (comfort) the soldiers participating in the war. It has been decided to hold the first preparatory meeting at 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 12th of this month (Tuesday) at 151 Rue du Père Robert to collect绒衫 (woolen sweaters), 短衫 (short shirts), 裤袜 (trousers and socks), and other comfort items to be shipped back to the motherland to reward the soldiers. The collection point is located at No. 23, Lane 753, Route Haig. The Shanghai Evening Post reports that Madame Gosselin, the French Ambassador to China, is inviting French women and friends of France in Shanghai to participate in a working group under her patronage to knit short socks and other necessary woolen garments to慰劳 (comfort) French soldiers. The association will meet on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday afternoons at the Jardin de Ste. Thérèse on Avenue Haig.

Swire's Ships Paint Over Names

The shipping lines of various countries in this city have now returned to normal. However, in response to the emergency situation, Swire & Co., a British company, has painted over the British flags and the words "British Merchant Ship" on both sides of its ships, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that in addition to painting over the flags and words, the copper English ship names and place of manufacture at both ends of the bow and below the stern have also been painted over. However, the Chinese ship names in the middle of the hull and the English ship name glass lamps on both sides of the second-floor platform have not been removed. They may also be removed if necessary.

Arrival and Departure Schedules Not Publicly Announced

The company also took special measures yesterday, canceling the daily issued ship arrival and departure schedules from today onwards. The dates of arrival and departure of ships will be kept strictly confidential. Although this move can avoid the attention of the enemy, it will cause many inconveniences in terms of business, as passengers planning to book cargo and travelers purchasing tickets will not be able to know the ship schedules in advance, which may have a considerable impact. The company's ship "Taiyuan," originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong and Haiphong tomorrow morning, is now expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 10th and will depart on the morning of the 12th, still heading to Hong Kong and Haiphong. It was previously reported that the Haiphong authorities, under the order of French protectorate, prohibited the import of goods, but there is no such news in the shipping industry. How it actually is remains to be verified.

Italian Mega Mail Ship to Depart the Day After Tomorrow

The Italian mail ship "Giulio Cesare" (i.e., "Ru Lian Gai Sa"), which was stranded in this city due to the European situation, docked at the Texas Pier. Now that the country has declared temporary neutrality, the ship has received a telegram from the head office to return to Europe. Therefore, it returned from the Texas Pier to the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou on the afternoon of the day before yesterday to load goods. It was originally scheduled to depart today. According to the company yesterday, the passenger and cargo procedures could not be completed in time, so it had to be postponed for two days and is now scheduled to depart at 5:00 AM on the 10th. Passengers must board the ship on the evening of the 9th. The time of the last passenger launch has not yet been determined, but it will probably depart from the Custom House Wharf at 10:00 PM on the evening of the 9th.

French Ship "Yangtze" Changes Course

The French company's irregular ship "Yangtze" arrived in Shanghai on the 5th and docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. It was originally scheduled to go to Japan this morning. According to the company, the ship has now changed its course and will not go to Japan, but will temporarily stay in Shanghai and plans to return to Europe. The exact date of departure is currently being requested from the head office. According to the scheduled timetable, it will return to Europe from Shanghai on the 18th of this month, but as the scheduled date is still far away, it may depart earlier.

Swiss Ships Refuse to Carry Nationals of Belligerent Countries

German ships on the coast of China and in the ports of the Yangtze River, Ningbo, and Ou River are still sailing as usual with difficulty and have not suffered any accidents. The three ships "Moufuk," "Haifuk," and "Hanna" are currently docked in the waters of Ningbo. Rumors that the North German company's ship "Xianghuosituo" was detained during its voyage have been confirmed by the company to be untrue, as the ship arrived in Kobe several days ago. Swiss commercial ships operating between Europe and Asia, due to the country's declared neutrality, will refuse to allow nationals of belligerent countries to board their ships in the future.

First Sealing and Dispatch of Airmail Since the War

A reporter from the New Voice Society learned from the Transportation Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday that airmail to European countries is being sealed and dispatched as usual.

Large Batch of European Mail Loaded Onto Ships Yesterday

As for mail to European countries, such as ordinary, registered, and express letters, the number of deliveries has been quite crowded in recent days. However, due to the outbreak of the European war, overseas postal transportation is not without difficulties, and with the reduction in flights, the delivery time is longer than before. However, the Postal Administration has decided to maintain the status quo and continue to collect and send mail as usual until orders are received. It is learned that a large batch of European mail was loaded onto the "Giulio Cesare" yesterday and transported via the Suez Canal, arriving in London on October 5th. Yesterday morning, a large batch of European mail arrived on the "Bangge Nu" ship from Europe and has now been delivered by the Postal Administration according to addresses.

### British and French Troops Will Not Withdraw, Concessions Remain As Peaceful As Ever, Rumors of New Demands from the Japanese Side

The Japanese government requested the diplomatic representatives of Britain, France, Russia, and Germany stationed in Tokyo on the 5th to withdraw their troops in China to avoid accidents. The day before yesterday, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura Yoshiaki, visited the consuls of Britain, France, and Germany to verbally request that the belligerent countries carefully consider and avoid unfortunate incidents in China. Diplomatic circles generally believe that these two actions are

the same nature

But on the 6th, the embassy and army and navy spokespersons did not clearly state the requests and suggestions of the Japanese government at the reception for reporters, only stating three points: (1) The belligerent countries must avoid unfortunate frictions in China; (2) The detailed content cannot be released due to government orders; (3) The Japanese Navy has the right to adopt

necessary steps

However, the content of the steps is not allowed to be disclosed. According to reporters, the Japanese side merely requested the belligerent countries to avoid conflicts in China, intending to have Britain and France withdraw their troops stationed in Shanghai. However, British officials believe that there are

within China

There are no German troops, and the situation in the two concessions is not tense at present. It is generally believed that there is no need for British and French vehicles to withdraw in fact, so there is no need to reply to the verbal requests made by the Japanese side to the British consul. Also, yesterday

rumors on the outside

The Public Concession Authority was requested to: (1) Hand over the police power of the extra-mural roads west of Yidingpan Road and Difeng Road; (2) Hand over the local court in the First Special Zone, which the authorities categorically denied yesterday.

### French Ambassador Urges Expatriates, Each With Unwavering Faith, The Last War Must Be Won, Future Children Can Rest in Their Cradles

The Shanghai Times reports that French Ambassador Gosselin received the French expatriates in Shanghai at his residence at noon yesterday (6th) and delivered a speech stating, "I expect every Frenchman to do his duty to the end. This is an example of the patriotism of the French. The British and French governments have done their best to stop the outbreak of war, but they have not been able to stop it due to the cunning attitude of the German government." Ambassador Gosselin then stated the extent to which the two democratic governments

Prevented a Great War

He talked about the outbreak, and also involved two telegrams he received from Paris explaining the overall situation, and also said that even after the German army had been dispatched, the British and French ambassadors to Germany still visited the German Foreign Minister to request Germany to stop its actions. Germany did not take any action on this request. As a result, France

Declared war on Germany

France will fight with all its strength, courage and honor. My generation had hoped that France would not go to war again, but these events have made it clear that France can immediately go from dream to reality. I can guarantee to you that we will

Fight and win

Because this time must be the last war, so we must win. We must make sure that future children can rest safely in their cradles, progress should outweigh destruction, and people should be free. I am now speaking with a spirit of great confidence. Long live France." Ambassador Gosselin continued to

Soon Leave Shanghai

Speaking to the French expatriates serving in the army, he said that they all eagerly wanted to go to serve the country, and the authorities were making the fastest and most proper transportation arrangements. Ambassador Gosselin asked the French expatriates staying in Shanghai to devote themselves to fate, but remember that their obedience to orders can provide the best service to the country.

Regarding how to deal with the issue of Jewish refugees coming to Shanghai later, the Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the French Consul, the Japanese Consul, and representatives of the Jewish Refugee Association met again on the 6th to discuss everything. It is learned that the 900 Jewish refugees who have decided to come to Shanghai will be carried by Italian ships. Since no more refugees will come to Shanghai other than these 900, the parties concerned decided as a result of the discussion to allow them to land in Shanghai. As for the arrangements after arriving in Shanghai, they will be discussed at a later date.

### Xu Yefu and Nie Haifan Assassinated Yesterday, Both Died of Serious Injuries, None of the Murderers Have Been Apprehended

Within the Public Concession this week, since the shooting of Wu Zhiqian, the principal of Shanghai Women's Middle School, occurred on Monday (4th), and she died of her serious injuries, the Concession Police Authority immediately took urgent measures and strictly investigated the murderer. Unexpectedly, just three days later, two more shootings occurred on the same day yesterday. The news spread, and there was a lot of discussion. The victims of the two cases were Xu Yefu, the former section chief of the Second Section of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, who was recuperating at the Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road in West Shanghai, and Nie Haifan, the principal of Da Hai Middle School at No. 1456 Jing'an Temple Road and the director of the Reception Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Branch. Both died of serious injuries, and the murderers escaped. The details of each situation are as follows:

Xu Yefu

Xu was from Tiantai, Zhejiang Province, and was 40 years old. Before the Shanghai War, he served as the section chief of the Third Section of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and a member of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters. When the Chinese army retreated westward and the administrative institutions were disbanded, Xu retired to his hometown and did not ask about foreign affairs. In the middle of last month, Xu was suffering from alternating chills and fever in his hometown, so he took a boat to Shanghai to seek medical treatment at Xiaoshadu Road on August 21st

Labor Hospital

And lived in ward 14 of the hospital. For more than ten days, the illness has gradually recovered, unexpectedly, at about one and a half last morning, he was suddenly heard to be shot.

After Admiral Hertoff, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, came to Shanghai to take up his post, he had been cruising in North China for a month. After the outbreak of the European war, he suddenly arrived in Shanghai on the 6th afternoon from North China on Commander Hertoff's private fast ship "Isabel". He met with Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet. Regarding the fleet movements of the US side, rumors in this port that Commander Hertoff had met with Japanese officials to talk, the US side denied this. After meeting with Commander Glassford, Commander Hertoff also met with foreign naval officers. Commander Hertoff is waiting to handle important public affairs in North China, and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the original ship for Qingdao this morning. If he does not leave in the morning, he will leave Shanghai at noon.

### Moon Approaching Earth, Another High Tide, Warehouses and Buildings Weigh Heavily, Ground Subsidence Will Inevitably Cause Water to Rise

According to the prediction of the Junpu Bureau, there will be another high tide in the Huangpu River starting on the 14th. Because the moon is close to the earth, the tide level is particularly high. It is predicted that the quantity of the morning tide on that day will be 11 feet 8.2 inches, the noon tide will be 11 feet 8 inches, the morning tide on the 15th will be 12 feet 3.2 inches, the noon tide will be 12 feet 2.4 inches, the morning tide on the 16th will be one foot 8.5 inches, the noon tide one foot 8.7 inches, the morning tide on the 17th will be 11 feet 3 inches, the noon tide will be 11 feet 8 inches, the morning tide on the 18th will be 10 feet 0.93 inches, the noon tide will be 11 feet 1.6 inches, the morning tide on the 19th will be 9 feet 4.2 inches, and the noon tide will be 10 feet 0.34 inches. Among the high tides in the above six days, the tide on the 15th is the highest, only a few inches away from the bund revetment. Therefore, the tide may come ashore at that time, and the current is turbulent at the same time, reaching 2.4 nautical miles per hour. Also, Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Guangxi Road, and Yinghua Street are commercial center areas, and the buildings are towering. Gansu Road, Wenjisi Tor Road, and other places are concentrated locations for warehouses and stacking, and the pressure is very heavy. Therefore, most of the ground has sunk, and it is inevitable that they will be troubled by the tide water rising from the sewers during the tidal period.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Line German Ships Sailing As Usual, No Order to Ban Sailing, Moufuk Expected to Return to Shanghai

Since the outbreak of the European war, the general public in Shanghai who are from Ningbo have been quite concerned about whether the German ships on the line are still sailing as usual. A reporter from Dagang Society specifically asked the Moufuk wheel business office of Lihe Foreign Company's shipping department yesterday. It was said that the ship had not received any order from the German Consulate General to ban sailing. The reason why it has been stationed outside the Zhenhai estuary for a long time is because it has to wait for the first ship to arrive and unload in turn. We have just received a telegram saying that the ship only started unloading imported goods on the 5th, and it has not been completed yet. After unloading, it will load export goods, which will take until the 10th to complete at the fastest. Therefore, it is expected to leave Zhenhai and return to Shanghai on the 11th, and will continue to travel back and forth as before. As for the Haifuk ship's decision to open Yong, it is still a few days after Moufuk, so its return to Shanghai will also be later. It was found that the extension of its schedule was due to the restriction of the Ningbo authorities on the anchorage of the navigation wheels, and the same is true for British and Italian wheels. It is also learned that the Hanna wheel of the German Far East Company is also scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 15th and sail as usual.

### German Nationals Rush to Retrieve Goods Stored in British Warehouses; Confiscation Unlikely to Be Implemented Immediately; British Consulate Instructs on Proper Procedures

According to the English-language "Da Mei Wanbao" (North China Daily Mail), many German nationals in this city have furniture and goods stored in the warehouses of the British company "Beauty Arts Company." This morning (yesterday), they went to the Jing'an Temple Road office of Beauty Arts Company to retrieve their stored goods. Although there were rumors in the city that the goods of German nationals would not be returned, the company returned the stored goods to German nationals who settled their accounts. An employee of the company strongly denied the rumor that the goods of German nationals had been confiscated. He stated that the company would return all goods to anyone who had paid their warehouse storage fees. However, some British wharves and warehouses, in accordance with the "Trading with the Enemy" regulations announced by the British Embassy a few days ago, do not allow German goods stored in their warehouses to be moved out. It is heard that this regulation, announced by the British Embassy due to the European war, has not yet been enacted into law, so British businesses may temporarily decide for themselves. It is understood that this regulation is only a preliminary warning, providing general guidance for British businesses. A committee has been established in the British Consulate General, meeting daily to provide instructions on difficult issues encountered by British businesses in Shanghai and other ports. Many British businesses have sent letters or orally inquired with the committee. According to an official who spoke to a reporter today, some British businesses hold German property, which is clearly detrimental to themselves. For example, goods that have little value to the enemy in the context of the war continue to occupy valuable storage space if they are not allowed to be moved out.

In the future, 8,000 bags will be handed over to the Rice Merchant Guild for sale at subsidized prices. The Ministry of Finance has ordered the Inspector General of Customs to allow the tax-free import of this foreign rice, and the Foreign Exchange Review Committee has provided a foreign exchange of £10,000 at the official exchange rate of 7 pence per dollar.

Sale at Subsidized Prices Measures Have Been Agreed Upon

Zhang Nianxuan, chairman of the Shanghai Rice Merchant Guild, consulted with Yu Qiaqing the day before yesterday on measures for subsidized rice sales, and the following was agreed upon: (1) Five subsidized sales locations will be set up in the two concessions, designating three rice stores in the Public Concession and two rice stores in the French Concession. It is said that contacts have been made with the Jade Buddha Temple and the Quanzhang Guild Hall, etc.; (2) The price will be in accordance with the Public Concession's price limit, at 20 yuan per stone, or 2 jiao per shi sheng; (3) Each person is limited to purchasing 2 yuan of subsidized rice.

At the same time, rice prices in this city fell yesterday, with top-quality Changbang rice falling to 36 yuan per stone.

Negotiations to Continue for Further Orders of Foreign Rice

Once a substantial quantity has been registered, the initiators will convene a meeting of all those who have placed orders, and then telegraph Saigon to place further orders, and elect custodians. However, those placing orders must pay at least 50% of the price when placing the order, with the remainder to be paid according to the final price. The collection of payments will be entrusted to a bank. It is heard that if the government approves the exchange rate for ordering foreign rice at the official exchange rate, it will cost 20 yuan per stone in national currency. If it is at the Shanghai black market exchange rate, it will definitely be more than this amount.

### Male Corpse Found Murdered on Dahua Road This Morning; Four Axe Wounds on the Body; Seems Like the Body Was Moved There After Death

At about 0:10 this morning, a man in his thirties was found murdered on Dahua Road near the back of the Da Metropolitan Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road. Someone from the dance hall immediately telegraphed the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. They found the deceased had a gold tooth. He was wearing a blue striped silk short shirt and pants, a white undershirt, and black shoes, but no socks. There were four axe wounds on his body: one on his head, one on his left hand, one on his right shoulder, and one on his right waist. Because the cuts were very deep, the large intestine had flowed out. Judging from his appearance, he seemed to be of middle class. What was strange was that there was not much blood around the corpse, nor were there any messy footprints. According to general speculation, it seems that this person had already fallen asleep before he was murdered, and the murderer moved the body to that location. The police station has now sent the body to the coroner's office and is starting to investigate clues. Relatives of the deceased are also encouraged to come and identify the body in the hope of uncovering the truth.

### Woman Requests Difficult Marriage; Husband Demands Cohabitation; Judge Advises Reconciliation

Wang Yiche (age 30, formerly a teacher), the son of Wang Junshan (hao Zhiyi) from Jiading, recently filed a lawsuit for divorce in the civil division of the Special No. 2 Court through his wife, Wang Yan Shaolin (age 26, also from Jiading), represented by lawyer Jiang Zongpan. The reason stated was that in recent years, her husband has been wandering outside, having affairs with women, and developing addictions, neglecting the plaintiff's livelihood. He wrote a letter of repentance but did not repent. She requested that the court order him to compensate her for the violation money of 10,000 yuan as stated in the letter of repentance, and to return clothing and other items. After receiving the complaint, the court once held a hearing presided over by Judge Ma Yishu. The defendant appointed lawyer Cai Liucheng to appear on his behalf and opposed the divorce. The hearing was postponed to wait for the defendant himself to appear in court for questioning. This information has already been reported in this newspaper. This case was heard again in the Civil Division 7 yesterday morning by Judge Yu Changzi. Both the plaintiff and the defendant arrived in court with their lawyers. The court first questioned the plaintiff, Wang Yan Shaolin, about her reasons for requesting a divorce, and then questioned the defendant, Wang Yiche. He admitted to writing the letter of repentance, but said it was a compromise to appease her. As for the mistress, he had already broken up with her two or three years ago. As for his addiction, he occasionally smoked opium to treat his stomach illness, but he has now quit for two years. He said that the plaintiff's attitude changed after she started working at the Zhongde Hospital, and she did not often return home. He repeatedly wrote letters asking her to come home, but she ignored them. He suspected that there was an ulterior motive behind her current lawsuit for divorce. After examining the statements, the court earnestly advised both parties not to be contentious and to reconcile. Otherwise, the case would eventually conclude with one party suffering a loss. However, the plaintiff insisted that the defendant had repeatedly lied and could not be trusted. If they were to reconcile, the defendant would have to pay 50 yuan per month for living expenses. The defendant said that he was currently unemployed due to the national crisis and could only afford a maximum of 20 yuan per month for the plaintiff's expenses, so a reconciliation could not be reached. As it was past noon, the court ordered both parties to consider reconciliation outside the court and postponed the hearing for one week, and then adjourned the court.

### Attempted Fraud of Five Dou of Rice; Woman Sentenced to Detention; Zhao Xixi Acquitted

Zhang A'mei (also known as Shen Ju), a woman from Shanghai, was arrested earlier for attempting to defraud the Fengshun Rice Store at 670 Ningbo Road of five dou of white rice worth 16 yuan and 6 jiao. She confessed that she was instigated by Zhao Xixi, a comedian, so the police arrested Zhao as well. This information has already been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing of the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court continued the trial. Zhao consistently denied having instigated the crime, claiming that Zhang had falsely accused her. Zhang's testimony was evasive, saying that although Zhao did not directly defraud her of the five dou of white rice, she was ultimately harmed by Zhao, as if she had something difficult to say. The court asked if she had an affair with Zhao. Zhang replied that there was no need to say. Later, after the lawyers Zhang Shizhu and Fan Gangyuenliang, representing the police station and Zhao respectively, presented their cases, the court sentenced Zhang to 30 days of detention and acquitted Zhao Xixi.

### Shanghai Has Two More Pitfalls; Mainland Gambling Dens Continue as Usual; Yuan Road Zhaofeng Gambling Den Opens

A few people, including a Mr. Ma, have pooled a large amount of money and rented the former residence of a Western bigwig on Weihaiwei Road to serve as a club, named "Mainland." Its internal structure is the same as the gambling parlors in West Shanghai. Since its active preparations, it once faced the issue of opening with a notification and almost ran aground. It is now learned that it is proceeding as usual and will open on schedule. The Zhaofeng Gambling Den, a new large-scale establishment, recently opened opposite Zhaofeng Park in West Shanghai. Its shareholders are a few people from Guangdong, including Liang Pei, and they have appointed Ye A'hua as the manager. The total capital is 50,000 yuan. It faces Hollywood from afar, competing with it for a day's worth of business. On the day of the official opening the day before yesterday, someone mischievously played a trick. Just as the gamblers were in high spirits, the light switch suddenly broke, plunging the entire parlor into darkness. This happened twice in a row, causing all the gamblers to be terrified. Some unscrupulous people took the opportunity to loot, and it is said that some gamblers' funds were completely stolen.

### First Charity Tennis Match: Handicap Final Changed to Charity Match; To Be Held at 3 PM Next Saturday; Famous Players Such as Lin Baohua Invited to Participate

The Shanghai Open Tennis Handicap Tournament, organized by the Shanghai Tennis Club, has been going on for three weeks since its opening. In Group A, only Wang Wenzheng, Li Guofan, and Zhang Dingzhao remain eligible for the final. The competition committee plans to hold the Group A final at 3 PM on the 15th of this month (Friday). It has also sought the consent of Mr. Yuan Ludeng, secretary of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, to use this competition as an opportunity to expand it into a charity tennis match. Famous players such as Lin Baohua, Wang Wenzheng, Zhang Dingjian, Li Guofan, Tang Baojia, Liang Deguang, and Xu Chengwei have been invited to join and perform in singles and doubles matches. Tickets will be sold for 10 yuan, 5 yuan, 3 yuan, and 1 yuan. The proceeds from the sale will be used by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to provide relief to refugees, so that tennis players and spectators can benefit the thousands of refugees in this city. It is reported that in addition to the competition committee members Chen Qihao and Chen Qijun presiding over the competition, all fundraising work and the responsibility for collecting and delivering donations will be handled by Li Ziyang, a staff member assigned by the Refugee Relief Association. It has been found that sports enthusiasts in this city have already been separately engaged in relief work for refugees in major and minor soccer, basketball, and table tennis matches, with considerable success. However, the tennis community has not yet made any significant contribution. This charity match promoted by the competition committee is a win-win situation. It concerns the relief of refugees and is an unprecedented charitable act, for which they have an unshirkable responsibility.

Wang Wenzheng vs. Lin Baohua (Singles)

Xu Chengwei vs. Liang Deguang (Singles)

Li Guofan—Wang Wenzheng

Tang Baojia—Liang Deguang

### An Opportunity to Make a Foreign Fortune?

— (Liu Xinghuo)

The Purchasing Power Is Not What It Used to Be; Maintain the Indigenous Economy to Consolidate the Foundation for the War of Resistance

The common saying is: "The opportunity to make a foreign fortune has come!" Indeed, during the First World War, the deformed development of Shanghai's commerce did allow a few merchants to make huge profits, adding an astonishing amount to their fortunes. Regardless of whether the means of obtaining these fortunes were legitimate or despicable, the fact that their descendants used them to wield power and influence did make others envious. As a result, a gambling mentality was fostered. Many people believe that "hard work cannot make you rich" and fantasize about the arrival of a second opportunity to "make a foreign fortune."

The outbreak of this European war, in the eyes of merchants, is seen as a way to realize their fantasies. Therefore, they have been importing foreign goods in large quantities these past few days. This has caused the foreign exchange rate to be stretched as demand exceeds supply. The British pound is trading at four offices, and the US dollar has entered the seven-yuan range. Whether "foreign fortunes" can be made steadily in the future is still uncertain, but at least for now, their large-scale imports of foreign goods have temporarily plunged Shanghai's finances into chaos.

"Can foreign fortunes be made?" Of course, it depends on the skill, strength, and weakness of the merchants' methods. However, relying solely on the subjective power of merchants, it is actually impossible to be absolutely certain. The main determining force lies in the evolution of the objective situation.

In the current situation, this European war is similar to the last war in form but not in substance. The overall situation is vastly different from what it was. The participating countries in Europe are narrower than before, and the Far East is also experiencing the Sino-Japanese War. The former indicates that there is still some possibility for foreign goods to be transported to Shanghai, while the latter shows that the purchasing power of the Chinese people is weaker than it was during the previous European war. Looking ahead from these two points, there may be some profits, but making a "foreign fortune" is not guaranteed.

Leaving aside international affairs, let's just talk about Shanghai. In recent years, the development of industry is not comparable to the immature situation in 1914. Many foreign goods have been replaced by domestic goods. Naturally, the appearance of domestic goods may not be as good as foreign goods, but their low price makes them suitable for the needs of most people below the capitalist class. Although the raw materials for Chinese industry still mostly rely on overseas sources, when there is no other choice, taking a step back to "indigenize" may still be able to sustain it.

Precisely to consolidate the economic foundation during the War of Resistance, it is not beneficial to the country to massively purchase foreign goods, causing capital outflow and disrupting the market by raising prices. On the contrary, if we can comprehensively plan a new domestic goods industry plan at this time and in this place, on the one hand, to meet the needs of Shanghai, and on the other hand, to maintain the export of indigenous goods as much as possible, we can make the wartime economic foundation stronger and unshakable. Merchants with long-term vision will certainly understand that "high-priced" "foreign goods" cannot be widely promoted in Shanghai. The longer the war lasts, the more financially strained people become, and the less sales "high-priced" "foreign goods" will have. And cheap, indigenous domestic goods will be more welcomed by people. Therefore, whether based on national interests or personal interests, establishing an indigenous industrial foundation during the war is the most legitimate and surest path for merchants at present. However, it must be remembered that even though it is said that "making a domestic (goods) fortune" is better than "making a foreign fortune," "business ethics" still need to be maintained. If one promotes "domestic goods" in name but actually "robs a burning house," then "making a domestic (goods) fortune" is no different in its depravity from "profiting from the national crisis."

### Mr. Wei Letang's Painted Fan

New Movie Introduction

### Midnight

— Bai Hua

"Midnight" is a standard Hollywood comedy.

However, within this absurd story, it exposes the ugly side of so-called high society. Hollywood screenwriters often create various colorful stories to please gentlemen and ladies, but in an environment surrounded by pornography and money, the themes they can pick up are precisely the affairs of the gentlemen and ladies themselves. Therefore, when laughing at the characters on the silver screen, perhaps they are laughing at their own shadows! Just like this "Midnight," a singer who has nothing in her pockets after arriving in Paris suddenly wears a noble dress, goes in and out of high-rise buildings, and is chased by handsome young gentlemen. And an old rich man, unable to prevent his young wife from having affairs, uses this singer to cover up scandals that cannot be publicized... All of this, after the screenwriters' writing skills, is made into a comedy, but who can deny that this is not exposing the ugly side of capitalist society?

Claudette Colbert is indeed an excellent actor, a versatile actor. Here, she plays the singer Eve very appropriately. For example, when she impersonates an invitation ticket to sneak into the concert, when the waiter tells the host that there is a stranger, she reveals a slight embarrassment, but immediately looks left and right, pretending to also be paying attention to that guest; when she wakes up in a luxury hotel and recalls the wonderful encounter of last night, witnessing the miracle before her eyes, her joy and surprise are all acted out to the extreme.

The director's vivid and skillful handling makes this comedy full of humor and fun. Here are a few examples: In the concert, he outlined the postures of various characters, and the relationship between Claudette Colbert, John Barrymore, Mary Astor, and Francis Lederer was written with meticulous detail. In the villa, Mary Astor discovered Claudette Colbert's secret and intended to announce it to the public. Don Ameche arrives. In this complicated relationship, the director makes the audience smile knowingly at every relationship and every shot.

The last part where John Barrymore is on the phone and the courtroom scene are too nonsensical, but the examples cited above are still worth learning by young directors—to learn the skills, not the content.

Don Ameche has few scenes. Mary Astor is charming and lovely, resembling a virtuous wife rather than a promiscuous woman with affairs.

Episode 15: Overseas Romance Suddenly Welcomes Tao Ye, Miraculous Scene in Fire Reveals Lotus Flower

He Liyu said, "I was just about to tell you, we received a telegram from Father saying that a senior family friend will be coming to Shanghai on Monday and wants us to meet him. He is also one of the shareholders who initiated the silk weaving factory and has run silk weaving factories before, so there are many things to discuss with him. Therefore, we won't be able to go to Freedom Village next Sunday either. Now that you say next Sunday is Jin Danyun's wedding day, then we have already decided to go to her wedding banquet that day, and my beloved sister will naturally want to go as well. We can go together." Zhu Airen said, "Yes, although I can't easily leave the hospital, since I promised her, I will definitely go. Fortunately, it's a Sunday, so it won't interfere with my work. There will be many old friends and classmates there that day, so I can meet them. Because Danyun is very sociable and amiable, there will definitely be many people attending the wedding banquet that day. We are discussing whether to go early Sunday morning or Saturday evening. Danyun wants us to go Saturday evening. What do you two think?" He Shuangyu said, "We don't mind. Aren't we always free? If you say go Saturday evening, then we'll go Saturday evening. However, since we're not going to Freedom Village on Sunday, we should call Father and let him know. Perhaps Mother thinks we're going, and she's busy preparing lunch for us. Also, we're concerned about whether our land lease for building the factory has been submitted to the village council and approved. That's something we're very concerned about." Zhu Airen laughed and said, "Don't worry! I'll call them and let them know we're not going. As for your land lease for building the factory, it will definitely be approved, so don't worry. In the future, I think Freedom Village will definitely prosper with factories, but it will probably be limited to light industry. They say: there's a limit of ten factories, but that's how it is calculated now, and the future is still a question. My principle is slightly different from our old Father. He believes that this is a rural village and will remain a rural village in the future, so we should strive to improve agriculture. Farmers should maintain their original identity and preserve the simple and frugal customs of the countryside. However, I believe that China is gradually progressing, and it will inevitably evolve from an agricultural society to an industrial society, at least in the coastal provinces. Agriculture will advance to the inland, and there are many places in our inland that are barren for miles. This is not because those places are all desolate and infertile, but simply because they have not been developed. The current trend is for everyone to go to the inland and border areas to cultivate, while in these areas with convenient transportation, we will revitalize our industry." (179)

### YMCA Establishes Used Bookstore for Cheap Sales

— Kongming

Maximize the Use of Waste to Make the Most of Resources, Cooperation from All Schools is Needed to Address Supply Difficulties

With the soaring prices of paper and printing, the cost of books used in schools has also increased significantly. To alleviate the burden on students, the YMCA students have launched a "Used Bookstore for Cheap Sales," selling used books from senior students to junior students for their use, maximizing the use of waste to make the most of resources. (All books are sold at 60% of the original price.) This has been quite popular.

However, recently there have been issues of insufficient supply to meet demand (very few are willing to sell drawing books such as complete English dictionaries and other high school science books, but there is a great demand for them), and insufficient demand to meet supply (many books, such as geography and history books, are being sold, but there are not many buyers, resulting in a large stock of books). To resolve this difficulty, it is not only necessary to rely on the enthusiastic assistance of the high school students in the association, but also to hope that other students (regardless of school) will provide more help and guidance. If any student feels like they have searched high and low without finding a used book, or if they have a used book and are willing to sell it at a low price (60%), please contact the YMCA. To facilitate students and serve the community, no commission is charged, unlike other stores that are profit-oriented. (Thank you)

### New Cookbook

— Respectfully Submitted by Your Servant Gu Zhongjing

Dear Editor,

Recently, rice prices have soared, and middle and lower-class families are mostly using wheat flour to fill their stomachs. However, the price of flour has also recently risen to six or seven yuan, and the general working masses are running around all day, still unable to get a full meal, which is truly the most serious problem in society. Now, I have a method that can temporarily alleviate the urgent situation. The method is to mix ten ounces of flour with six or eight ounces of bean dregs (commonly known as tofu dregs, sold by tofu shops). It is sweet and delicious, and bean dregs contain a large amount of vitamins. A large bowl can be bought for forty or fifty cents. Add a little salt and it can be eaten. I have tried it many times. Therefore, I ask that it be published in the newspaper to spread the word. I respectfully wish you good health in your writing.

### The Ideological Problem of Actors

— Outsider

Regarding this issue, it seems that no one has ever discussed it, nor has anyone paid attention to it. However, I believe this issue is more important than "theatrical ethics" and the cultivation of actors' skills. The status of actors was previously despised by society, as they were considered to be worthless. Later, times and society changed, and after several ambitious actors awakened and made efforts, they gradually gained their current status.

When people praise actors, apart from their artistry, they always talk about how good their theatrical ethics are and how they have a spirit of courageous action, but rarely say that this actor is rich in national thought and national consciousness. This has fostered a kind of individual heroism, where they only know how to keep themselves clean and good, while neglecting the destruction and harm they cause to the entire nation and country. Therefore, I can say that actors in general lack a great deal of national thought. After being induced by fame and fortune, they are willing to do any kind of work, regardless of its nature. Of course, there are exceptions, but they are still in the absolute minority.

Last time, Kunqu actress Zhao Xiaolan flattered in Nanjing and secretly broadcasted in Shanghai, and this newspaper criticized and attacked her. However, when "Manchukuo" was established in the three northeastern provinces, many famous actors also went to participate in the "celebration," and many actors who were more knowledgeable and popular than Zhao Xiaolan went to the grand performances in "Eastern Hebei." That phenomenon shows that actors with a sense of fame and fortune have no nation or country in their minds, only personal happiness.

Of course, patriotic enthusiasm like that of Pan Yueqiao and others can still be seen in Shanghai. The previous drama troupe and stage colleagues who went to comfort the isolated army are good examples. Recalling the enthusiastic situation when Shanghai had not yet fallen, when broadcasting on the radio to encourage the purchase of national salvation bonds, it was indeed worthy of praise, but I believe that this is a very small expression and also an obligation that every citizen should have.

The lack of thought among actors is partly due to environmental factors. The coercion and temptation of the environment can also lead you down the path of selling your conscience. Improving the environment cannot be achieved by empty talk, so in the current environment, the most important thing is self-examination, striving to avoid bad temptations, and not selling your personality for the sake of life. Do as much as you can, and if the environment forces you down a dead end, then the only way is to break away from this dark environment.

Another point is that no one corrects them. Those who praise them only focus on the artistic aspect, and those who are knowledgeable only point out your artistic mistakes, absolutely not interfering in your private life and thoughts. In addition, actors rarely receive higher education, which fosters their selfish and profit-oriented hearts. Therefore, I hope that actors, in their spare time, in addition to artistic cultivation, also think about enriching their knowledge. This work requires the assistance and guidance of others.

In addition to actors having thoughts, an additional task to be done is to perform more meaningful plays (naturally, there is a causal relationship between thought and action here). "Eternal Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," "Liang Hongyu," and "Nanjie Pass," etc., all involve loyal service to the country. Other old plays can also perform "Battle of Pu Pass" and "Ningwu Pass" kinds of plays.

Not long ago, Ouyang Yuqian created improved Pingju for the China Drama Troupe in Shanghai, and most of it was about patriotism. We will not talk about the success of the improved Pingju, but we always believe that it is commendable to adopt plays with meaningful themes. Undoubtedly, in addition to actors themselves having national thoughts, they must also think about influencing the audience so that they can gain something besides watching the play, and remind the audience not to be intoxicated in the environment of singing and dancing for peace.

Brothers and sisters of the acting world, please examine yourselves!

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

A Teacher's Son Becomes Mayor

There are many strange things in the officialdom, especially in these years, where true talent and learning are not valued. As long as there are various relationships such as relatives and acquaintances on the family tree, it is much easier to find a job. If you can also flatter and cater to the superiors, buying everything they like, slowly mixing with friends who are "dog skin plasters," then you don't have to worry about your behavior. No matter how bad your qualifications are, you are guaranteed to be an official. During the Zhili-Lu Army era, there was a man named Zhao Yaoyun, who was originally a country bumpkin who couldn't recognize a few characters. Later, he became the chief advisor to the Zhili Governor's Office. A paint shop owner named Wang actually became the chief of the military law office and the magistrate of Tianjin County. The most ridiculous thing was that Yuan Zhenqing, who once served as the garrison commander of Tianjin, was also illiterate. He and Zhang Zongchang were friends who were "dog skin plasters." When the Zhili-Lu Army failed, he immediately ran to the famous opium den "Deyi Lou" in Tianjin to become a "smoke lighter," sitting on a small stool in front of the opium bed to light pipes for people. He was not ashamed of himself, and the saying "a great man can bend and stretch" can be used to describe this gentleman. It is said that the reason he became poor was due to the influence of his concubine eloping. In the end, he had a bank account with 100,000 yuan. When he was taking a car to the bank to withdraw money, he stopped by a friend's house for a short visit. When he said goodbye and came out, the car was already gone, and the 100,000 yuan in the leather bag in the car was considered a white gift to the driver. His opium expenses were very high, costing several thousand yuan a day. At first, he could sell some clothes and furniture, but later, when these things were sold out, he had to sit on a low stool and light pipes for people. (95)

### The Earliest Tanhuang

— Xitong

I was quite interested in reading Tianxu Wusheng's preface to the Ankang Gathering and Danran's Another Interpretation of Ankang in this publication. I don't have much research on this, but I only know that there is an article by Xu Chuanlin (i.e., Li Amao, who runs a tofu shop) in the special issue of Xiaoshuo Yuebao on Chinese Literature Research, "A Glimpse of Chinese Popular Literature - Tanhuang," and another article by Li Jiarui of the Academia Sinica in Renjianshi, "Tanhuang." They have described the origin, classification, evolution, etc. of Tanhuang in great detail, so there is no need for me to elaborate.

The value of Tianxu Wusheng's article lies in explaining that the main tones of Ankang in Hangzhou and Sutan's string music differ by one character because he is proficient in music theory. As for the origin of Tanhuang, tracing it back to Wen Tianxiang at the end of the Song Dynasty, or even to the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove in the Jin Dynasty, I think that is going too far. As Yun said in Volume 3 of Wen Wenshan's Complete Works, the Guide Record, each saying is a seven-character quatrain, with a description of the event in front, but not all of them are like this. Among them, there is a very long five-character ancient poem "On the Road to Gaosha," and after the poem "Guixiang," they are all five-character poems, and even most of them have no description of the event. Regarding Tanhuang as Taihuang is only because of Wen Tianxiang's preface to Passing Huangyan, which says: "I changed my name when I arrived at Huai. When I reached the territory of Tiantai, Zhang Zhezai found the Green Ripple Poem for me. After I wrote it, I titled it Written by Liu Zhu of Qingjiang. This is Passing Huangyan, sending twenty characters." I also think this is just speculation.

Approximately, Tanhuang was created because Kunqu was difficult to understand, so they changed the singing but not the dialogue. Kunqu also sings works from the Qing Dynasty. For example, the plays "Broken Bridge Meeting" and "Hebo" sung in Tanhuang mentioned by Xu Chuanlin were all changed from the Legend of Leifeng Pagoda. The earliest author of the Legend was Huang Tumi in the Yongzheng period. From this, it can be known that Tanhuang occurred after the Yongzheng period, even in the Qianlong era.

I have recently seen two earlier records of Tanhuang:

(1) In the fourth act of Shen Qi's Legend of the Wenxing Bang during the Qianlong period, the clownish Taoist says: "Singing Tanwang is my invention." He also says, "Selling olives, rude words are directly sprayed, eating vegetarian meals, chewing maggots in a mess." Selling olives and eating vegetarian meals are famous plays of "Houtan." It is unexpected that these plays already existed during the Qianlong period.

(2) In the episode "Fortune Telling" in the Zhui Bai Qiu Tong Ji (i.e., the current Zhui Bai Qiu Collection, Volume 3, Volume 11) in the 39th year of Qianlong, it is said: "Wait a moment, I also want to add a Tan Tou."

Even Taoists and fortune tellers also sing Tanhuang, which shows the popularity of Tanhuang at that time.

Before finding records about Tanhuang that are earlier than the Qianlong era, I will reserve my statement that Tanhuang originated in the Qianlong era.

### Shirley Temple Smokes Opium

— Huazhi

Shirley Temple recently has two new films, both centered on romance, and it is said that they have been performed with great success. One film is called "Miss Jane," which seems to be a true portrayal of Shirley's life. This is her sixth anniversary work dedicated to the screen; the other film is called "Susannah of the Mounties." This is Shirley's twentieth blockbuster. In this film, Shirley lives with the mountain people and learns many strange customs. There is a shot specifically filming her smoking opium. The Fox Company was afraid of burning her tongue, so they specially invited the fire scene arrangement expert from the film "Chicago Fire" to make a pipe for Shirley, with a mechanism inside. When Shirley is smiling and spewing clouds and fog on the screen, there is actually no smoke leaking into her mouth, otherwise she might have been sobbing long ago. According to Shirley's mother, romance films should not be performed too much. Shirley's ambition is to become a female detective. Letting her play in horror adventure films later will definitely be even more outstanding.
